B000002UAU|5.0|Along with Bob Dylan's \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" may be the most discussed, dissected and analyzed album in the history of modern popular music.  The level of anticipation was high, even by Beatle standards, in the aftermath of their previous release,\\"Revolver\\".  When \\"Pepper\\" arrived, however, it's impact derived not from it's individual songs, but from it's semi-conceptual blending of sound.  The individual tracks, while not truly related to each other (with the exceptions of the title track and \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\"), interact and weave together a wholeness of theme musically, rather than lyrically. While they would return to a similar approach for the second side of their last gasp masterpiece \\"Abbey Road\\", The Beatles, especially John Lennon and Paul McCartney, would never be this dependant on each other's seperate muses again. As the vast, echoing final note of \\"A Day in the Life\\" fades away at the album's close, the listener can almost feel the vibration of a sound that has altered the course of Rock music from what it had been into the multilayered collage it would soon become.  For this reason, if for no other, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" remains the most influential and important album of our time.
B00014X8KO|5.0|This DVD should have been released a long time ago, but better late than never. Im a huge fan of all types of anime but this movie is one of my favorites. This came out in 1996 and it still looks better than most of the anime on the market today and I own a crappy letterboxed bootleg version, I cant wait to see what this looks like in the beautiful anamorphic widescreen format. I wont go into the plots of the 3 stories, because the less you know about the tales the better, but If your a fan of sci-fi anime like Akira & Ghost In the Shell you should absolutley love this.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I can't believe that people actually buy this B.S.!!!!! There is obviously a large market for absolutely TASTELESS &quot;music&quot; (and I use that word as loosely as it possibly can). How these talentless individuals (I will NOT call the musicians for that would be a HUGE insult to TRUE musicians all around the world) got signed I have NO idea. Some idiot with a lot of money and perhaps a BIG favor being owed obviously conned someone into it. And a lot of idoit sheep follow the &quot;trend&quot; of people who have NO idea what good music is.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is so good and its only a debut. Kanye West is so good and he will only get better. He's already been making hot beats but now he gets to put his own lyrics over them. This album brings the soul back to hip hop. His rhymes are great and will sometimes make you laugh. I have been waiting for this album for so long. Even though jigga is done this album shows that the ROC still has more and Kanye is their future. Go get this album, i havent stopped listening to it.
B000127LW2|3.0|I am and always will be a big fan of Voyager.  The critics and<br />fans alike seemed to glaze right over this series.  After the Next Generation, Voyager was the best Trek made.<br />I was expecting this box set series to at least rival what was released for DS9 and NG.  What a disappointment !<br />Awful, cheap, orange, plastic, crap.  That about sums it<br />up.  It's like they didn't even want or try to take this set seriously.  The discs themselves are boring with no real graphics except for an attempt at a list of episode titles.<br />The cover is a gawdy cheap orange plastic thing that I broke trying to get it open.  It needs an instruction manual just to<br />open the set.  I haven't actually WATCHED the discs yet having just got them but the special features seem to rock<br />by description only but I was so disappointed with the look of this set I had to give my review right away.  Unless your a true Voyager fan, FORGET this set, it'll just make you feel cheated once again by viacom.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I had higher expectations for this CD, but I tend to do that a lot. Half of the CD is pretty dang good, but the other half is just ehhhh. I'm not very impressed. The CD doesn't hold up to the expectation that &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; has set, but that doesn't mean that it is bad at all. You can find gold in this CD. Just listen to tracks like &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, &quot;Rollover DJ&quot;, &quot;Look What You've Done&quot;, and &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;. All and all, not very good, but not very bad.
B000089RVX|5.0|There are numerous rock groups now and days which do not focus on many serious issue which occur in this world, but Evanescence is one of the few who do. This album is one of a kind and has shown so much passion and love. This album tells tales of death and insanity through an original sound, and astonishing lyrics. Though there are some songs which focus more on the instruments rather than the vocals(which is a shame since Amy Lee is incredible). The most impressive song is &quot;Imaginary&quot; which combines a compelling unique sound with the beautiful voice of Amy Lee into a song of imagination.
B000002AS3|5.0|Oasis isn't one of my favorite bands. I think that the drugs made them lose the magic touch, or mabey Definitely Mabey was just too good. This album is what rock should exist as today. New bands should follow this example of good music. I loved &quot;What's The Story, Morning Glory?&quot; a lot, but then I got Definitely Mabey and was blown away by it. I would list the best songs on this CD, but every song would tie for first place. This is one of my favorite CD's ever. It's just so damn good.
0449227421|3.0|On one level I enjoyed this book.  It was a fun read as a mystery-thriller.  But I agree with a number of the criticisms voiced already.  I didn't like the main character Jeannie & I didn't like the gratuitous political moralizing where all the bad guys were conservatives.  If you want to make your bad guys evil for their attempts at genetic manipulation & white supremacist rantings, fine, but don't throw in that they're against gun control & against welfare!  And, Jeannie, I just couldn't warm up to.  I know Follett likes his heroines feisty, which is fine, but Jeannie was just too counter-cultural for me.  The swearing, the free & easy sex life, the \\"smoking a little weed,\\" and, ugh, the nose ring.  Is that really necessary?  I also agree that Follett's presentation of academic life is unrealistic.  (I am an academic.)  Follett's books with a World War II theme are much  better.
0783226888|2.0|Dear God, what a bad movie. Based very loosely on Frederick Forsyth's book, THE DAY OF THE JACKEL, this travesty is filled with ridiculous plot devices, bad acting, cardboard characters, and a &quot;professional killer&quot; who is anything but professional. See the original 1973 movie starring Edward Fox for a real film. This version is saved from one star here only because of Sidney Poitier. A waste of time and money.
B0001906O0|5.0|This album is primarily a B-sides album and secondarily a rarities album. To those who are worried that not all the rarities are here you really needn't be concerned. Over the next eighteen to twenty-four months every Cure album will be re-released completely remastered and with a second disc of bonus material. It would be inconceivable that &quot;Faith&quot; would not then include &quot;Carnage Visors,&quot; and that &quot;Wish&quot; would not include its four &quot;lost&quot; instrumental tracks, etc. plus material that even die-hard fans may never have even heard of yet.<br />What you have here with Join the Dots is a couple dozen strong B-sides, many of which were famous in their own right. You can't go wrong picking up a copy.
B000001FRY|5.0|I will never forget the 1st time I heard of U2. My friend had a birthday party and received Boy on cassette. It was 1980 and I was 10. I remember studying the front of that cassette, the black and white stretched faces and the mysterious name, U2. It would be at least 3 years before I actually saw a picture of them, when October came out. They were mysterious and seemed to hold secrets. <br />I mean, what an absolutely perfect concept album. The moments of late childhood, the scary and exciting days before a boy becomes a man. For a kid who was in those exact moments, Boy played like a script and seemed to me, not preconceived in any way but organic in some mysterious way. There is no way any artist could consciously attempt to capture the essence found in Boy. U2 could never repeat this. They would have other achievments, but nothing as thematic or organic as Boy. <br />Boy is one of the most interesting moments of rock music and should be seen as a turning point for a genre that had rarely achieved this type of unconscious realism.
B00007BK2N|5.0|With the title of \\"24 Hour Party People\\" (A Happy Mondays song title) this film was always likely to be based on this band, and subsequently Factory Records. Admittedly New Order were my favorite band at the time, & their inclusion to me was a bonus. (The deleted scene of New Order forming from the ashes of Joy Division with new member Gillian on keyboards was important enough to be included in the film, in my opinion!).This film truly captures the spirit of the time. It is mainly based on fact, but like most films has exercised some artistic licence.<BR>This film was never going to be a definitive guide to the Manchester music scene (i.e Charlatans UK, Inspiral Carpets (neither actually from Manchester!), The Smiths, James etc), instead it's about Factory Records, The Happy Mondays, Joy Division, & New Order; this it did excellently.<br />Steve Coogan is brilliant at capturing the mannerisms & essence of Tony Wilson during this period. Remember, Steve Coogan is from Manchester & witnessed the scene himself - his brother Martin Coogan was in the band \\"The Mock Turtles\\".
B000127LW2|5.0|I was never able to watch Voyager after they dumped Kes, my favorite character. Seasons 1, 2 & 3 were gold. Seasons 4-7 were ludicrous due to the 7 of 9 characater. Could the producers and writers have been any more obvious in their intentions? Kes was an intelligent and subtle character. Watching 7 of 9 was the television equivalent of being propositioned by a prostitute in a catsuit! Truth be told I haven't watched any new Star Trek programming since they dumped Kes.
B00005NTJM|4.0|Good hard rocking British blues from the days when Jethro Tull was actually a good band, and not just a bunch lame '70's jokers!  If you actually like their '70's stuff, then you may not like this album...but those who actually know good music when they hear it will quickly realize that this is Jethro Tull at its best:  It was only downhill from here.<br />This album really highights early guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was later replaced by the more famous Martyn Barr after Abrahams quit to form Blodwyn Pig.  When they lost Abrahams and picked up Barr, they became a completely different band because Ian Anderson, not Mick Abrahams became the definitive leader.  Barr got a great guitar tone, but his ability was nowhere near that of Mick Abrahams.  Lots of instrumentals!  The highlights are &quot;Cat's Squirrel&quot; and &quot;Song For Jeffrey,&quot; but the whole album is listenable all the way through.<br />As far as I'm concerned, this album ('68), Stand Up ('69), Benefit ('70), and Aqualung ('71) are as far as I'll go with this band.  Their other albums are enough to make you want to cut off your ears!
0385504209|4.0|I'm sure by now most have heard the hype, but the point is, you should still know this book is worth checking out. If only to see an example of stellar research and writing  go a little mediocre before the last page. This is an enjoyable book and probably still the most instantly compelling book i've ever read... read the first 5 pages and you'll simply fall in. Don't expect to much though and you will not be dissapointed.
B00005KJ1G|4.0|Manowar, the band you either love or hate. I personally love Manowar and they are one of my most favorite bands. When I finally came around to buying Manowar's 1982 debut album Battle Hymns I had heard almost all of there latter albums. So initially Battle Hymns came as a shock to me. Not because its bad but because it was different. Though similar to their second album, Battle Hymns sounded very different from the Manowar I knew. Not near as fast, not nearly as well produced, and extremely dated sounding. Does it make it bad? Oh hell no. This is still Manowar all the way through, just at their young roughly produced best. Though they would go on to do better material, Battle Hymns still stands up to be a classic in their long catologue (This band is actually older than Metallica!). So if your a fan and haven't heard Battle Hymns yet, just don't expect Kings of Metal and you will end up loving it.
6305327041|4.0|I have heard many good things from my friends about this film and how Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up once again in a film.  I tried to rent it but a certain store that i will refer to as \\"LackLuster\\" does not carry this film.  I'm sitting at home one night and theres the movie \\"Four Rooms\\" on Starz so i decide to watch it.  First film: Tim Roth stumbles into a room of witches and stuff happens its entertaining.  Second film: Tim Roth gets the wrong room and the story contains sick sexual fantasies, a large gun, and a psychotic pill popping maniac, need i say more?  Third film: (by far my favorite) Robert Rodriguez directed this hilarious short where Tim Roth has to take care of these kids....its HILARIOUS i can't say much about it or it will ruin it for you.  And Fianly the Fourth Room: Directed by Quentin Tarantino this final room is a let down.  Tarantino himself acted in it which is my biggest complaint.  He over-acts and ruins it.  You think a man who shows up drunk on late night talk shows would be a good at acting drunk but he's not.  This move was sub-par compared to other films quentin tarantino has been involved with but much better than most films.  If you are a huge Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez fan like myself than you should buy this film now.  If not than i suggest you rent it or catch it on cable.
B00018D44U|4.0|We Norah Jones fans can all breathe a sigh of relief -- Jones is back and &quot;Feels Like Homes&quot; certainly does.  Although not as completely successful as &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; -- there are two or three tracks I'm not crazy about -- there are some absolutely gorgeous songs that rival, if not surpass, those on that album.  And, once again, Jones' voice is a marvel, smokey and smooth at the same time.  The arrangements are fantastic, and who'd have thunk that Dolly Parton, of all people, could blend so marvelously with Ms. Jones.  All in all, I'm so happy with &quot;Feels Like Home,&quot; happy for us fans, and happy that Ms. Jones didn't hit a sophmore slump.  Brava!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this film.  I really like Bill Murray, but his female co-star said it best, just another male mid-life crisis.  It attempted to depict the void that people feel when they attempt to find meaning apart from God and showed how flat we fall when we turn to drugs, sex and alcohol.  The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that they would show that the characters learned something.  It was a false hope.  Don't waste the time and the money.
0812550706|5.0|This book is the greatest sci-fi novel ever! It includes all the basics for a sci-fi novel: little kids beatin' up aliens and ***holes. If you have not read this book, read it. <br />It includes Ender as a kid. He's small, a bully target, and yet, he could beat up a kid bigger than him. Moving on, he signs up for space-military-type training. He gets bigger, smarter, and more aggressive. <br />I heard there is a movie being made for Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow combined! Read this book before it's too late. <BR>Usually movies made from books leave out a lot of information and cool stuff. <BR>            So read and enjoy this future-movie book!
B000002KNI|4.0|I was happy to see Simon and Garfunkle in concert on their recent &quot;Old Friends&quot; tour, and was more than pleased by the performance of two men who, by all rights, should've been retired and not in the best of vocal form. The afterglow of the Philadelphia show led me to reacquire this CD from the 1981 Central Park reunion show. Since most of the songs from the current tour are reflected by the Central Park set list, it was worth it for me.<br />This CD is actually better than I originally remember it. Maybe I was just too wrapped up in my new wave years (I was a junior in college at the time the album was released), but both men were in strong form vocally. It also meant that, as a greatest hits sort of show, all the bases are essentially covered. Even the Paul Simon solo material comes across as well matched (in particular, &quot;American Tune&quot; which rings truer in the post 9/11 world as it did back then). The instrumentation is a bit dated, Richard Tee's keyboards especially, but that's more the fault of the times than of performance.<br />And the performances here are superb. Oddly, the one major omission from the disc is &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace.&quot; If you watch the DVD of the concert, it was Simon's tribute to John Lennon and is when a fan charges the stage, distracting Simon from the microphone. Art Garfunkle is relegated to only one solo hit here, and naturally it's &quot;A Heart In New York.&quot; Just as &quot;counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike&quot; gets a huge outburst of applause (it did here in Philly, too), &quot;Heart&quot; brings the crowd to express itself with exuberence.<br />On the other hand, when Art begins to sing &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; it's hard not to notice that he can still sound like the folk singing choirboy of the sixties, and even more so for &quot;The Sound of Silence.&quot; Despite all the infighting, back biting and legendary arguments that Simon and Garfunkle have shared over their career, there is no denying that - as a duo - they created magic. After 20 years, I'm glad &quot;The Concert In Central Park&quot; is back in my library.<br />PS: I eagerly await the inevitable &quot;Old Friends&quot; concert disc, and would also recommend Paul Simon's &quot;Concert In The Park&quot; from 1991.career, there is no denying that - as a duo - they created magic.

B0000C8AV2|4.0|Due to the uneven quality (understatement) of Dylan's '80s work, I put off listening to Oh Mercy for years.  I liked most of Infidels and a few cuts off of various albums from that decade, but by '89, I was pretty convinced that Dylan had gone off the tracks for good.  I honestly didn't hear this cd (unremastered version) until 2002. To my surprise, Oh Mercy is great--spaced out mix, deep grooves, compelling lyrics/storytelling.  I think it's better than Time Out of Mind.  It's also superior to Under the Red Sky (1990?)--the release many critics considered a sign of Dylan's return to form.
B00008977N|5.0|after reading the reviews i am just amazed at how people actually notice any problems(?)I saw pg live in Glasgow,Scotland in 1995 and this dvd just took me back to that fantastic moment in time ( what a moment that was!)It was a visual and musical masterpiece of an evening. Obviously some of the other reviewers have bad copies or tv's etc as has been mentioned before,but i say just sit back,relax and take it easy(remember you can always go back to the old fashioned way and listen to the double cd version of the concert)Stop looking for holes,dodgy bits etc and chill!<BR>Buonanotte
B00018D44U|2.0|I loved the first album so rest assured I'm not anti-NJ.  I am extremely disappointed in this offering.  The sound quality is awful, awful, awful.  It stinks.  Next time, rent a studio...<br />Too country.  Enough said.<br />No snap.  No zest.  She's like 23?  This album sounds like she's already bored with the whole singing career thing....<br />In summary.  If you live in a small town where the local bar sometimes has live music, this CD will remind you of that experience....you know, the CDs they hawk when they go on breaks?  The ones neatly stacked on the piano?  Well here you go except they ain't 5 bucks....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly a cancelled television series from Joss Whedon best known for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel was one of the few intelligent shows on television recently.  The show followed nine people on a spaceship set roughly 500 years in the future, the show had the best ensemble cast I've ever seen with each character having their own identity and nuances.  Everything Firefly did it did with intelligence whether it be stories, wit, or humour.  Sadly Fox cancelled the series after just 14 episodes but plans for a upcoming film are being made.  I would highly reccomend this show to anyone who wants a intelligent science-fiction show with a great cast.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Shots of Tokyo is beautiful.  It's refreshing for a hollywood movie to shoot film of modern day Tokyo in realistic terms.  Scarlett Johannson is beautiful, sexy, cute and sweet - I luv her.  I like how nothing is forced.  Nothing gratuitous at all.  Is it slow?  Perhaps but I'd say it's ok and was pretty funny and not boring.  The subject of lonliness.  Well aren't most of us.  I certainly can relate to that.  So this movie is nothing too introspective.  Bill Murray is funny.  Just don't expect anything great that's all...unless you can psychoanaalyse it more than I was trying to.
6305308659|5.0|Pleasantville is a 1950's tv show that paints the lives of people living in a \\"perfect\\" world, full of good family values where colors don't exist, where firemen never have to deal with fire but just rescuing cats, where couples sleep in separate beds, where the most physical contact couples have is holding hands or a kiss on the cheek, where people don't swear, where the basketball team never ever loses, where people are just happy living routine lives where everyone loves each other and ...nothing ever happens. <br />When 2 teenagers from the 90s find themselves trapped into pleasantville by some kind of \\"luck\\", the whole world that pleasantville is based on collapses. The two teenagers now in the skin of the two kids of the show, start changing the way people think. Or rather just let people think for themselves. The crowd of pleasantville discovers than there is more than holding hands in relationships, that you can't always win a basketball game and that if you prepare the salad before you make the burger, life will keep going.<br />This movie is to me a satire on how people have become free and how the impredictibility of life is what living really is. In some ways, the movie makes allusions to the book burnings and the rewriting of history by the nazis, the segregation of blacks from whites, and how people fought to overcome it all to become free. Free to think for yourself, free to be who you want to be regardless of what the society expects of you.<br />The Genius of pleasantville is how all those underlying very serious subjects are all wrapped into sugar, and turned into a very enjoyable, innocent-like, cute little story.<br />This is a great movie, very smartly done and very original.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence in the greatest band in the whole world.
B0000UHFC6|3.0|I love the Lord of the Rings, and all of the soundtracks have been brilliant five star stuff, but what I hate of this particular album is that it feels just as a sample, there are many things left out from it. The cd release is terrible, if one sees the movie, the soundtrack really comes to live in such form.<br />The last two soundtracks had a similar problem, but not so much, in this one it was really noticeable.<br />I hope that Howard Shore releases a complete edition in the future(with a possible re-release of the movies as well), an edition with the whole music from all 3 films(similar to the cds that came with the Star Wars Special Edition release).<br />Another thing I disliked in this particular album was that even though it maintained the wonderful perk of having the tracks with the same name as the book chapters, in this one it felt disorganized in comparison with the film, for example, that the White Tree track is actually the beakons being lit, this makes no sense, while the track in which Gandalf and Merry enter Minas Tirith(which should have been called The White Tree) does not exist. Or what about the Forth Eorlingas in this film, also cut from the album.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Don't you know someone in your life that tells the tallest tales of life? You want to believe them because you love them but then all you know of them are stories almost lies at times. `Big Fish' reminds you that sometimes you just have to see with the eyes of a child and to accept that their life is their tall tales.<br />Edward Bloom [Albert Finney] has a son and tells the most unique tale of how his son was born while he was capturing a 'Big Fish' problem is he's been telling this story for all the 30 something years his son has been alive and Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] is not enchanted with his fathers tall tales of life and love.<br />This film takes you on two journeys; the whimsical journey of a young Edward Bloom played by Ewan McGregor from his home town of Auburn on to the road of an ideal southern town, a moving circus, to the heart of the love of his life Sandra Templeton played by both Amy Lohman and Jessica Lang, on a secret military mission, and then the parallel journey of his later life with his son.<br />This film had the feel of a Superhero film sprinkled with real life and fables. There is a lot of fun in this movie and a great story of acceptance between father and son. The casting of this film blew me away. Lots of big names and a great cast for Edward Bloom [Finney and McGregor] and Sandra Templeton [Lohman and Lang] not to mention all the supporting characters.<br />Although I really enjoyed this film, I think it would have been better with a fresh director.
B00005AQGH|5.0|recorded in 7 days.  Learn about who the real Makivelli was and what he did to evade his ememies.  As far as the album goes this is the most original, real rap album ever.  It is the Dark Side of the Moon of rap albums.  Some claim that the Black album is where its at.  No my friends this si the real deal.  2 pac's  best and the rap industry's best album ever.
B000092ZYX|2.0|This album is for fans only, although i don't know how they have any left.. unless all these reviewers giving them 4's and 5's are secretly record label executives. I mean honestly, how hard would it be to make &quot;backdrifts&quot; or &quot;the gloaming&quot;? Nothing but incoherent computer noises. Most of the other songs are just tuneless and depressing. You can call it genius all you want but like one reviewer said, Radiohead fails on the most basic level, which is that music has to be enjoyable. Ok Computer was thier peak and they know it. They're not even trying anymore.
B00018D44U|4.0|I liked this CD, I'm not sure if I like it as well as her first one or if you just have to be in a different sort of mood when you listen to it. For those of you who can't get enough of Norah Jones, listen to her track on the Dolly Parton compilation (Just Because I'm a Woman). Norah sings &quot;The Grass is Blue&quot; and it is great.
B00005JLFC|5.0|It was for the first time that I insisted, with my (at that time) boyfriend, to go and see a movie!<BR>Afterwards, I bought the LP, and in spite of listening to it very regularly year after year, I never got tired of listening to it.  The songs have often helped me in difficult periods of my life, because I could identify with them in several situations.<BR>Meanwhile, I don't have a record player anymore and I only buy CD's and DVD's now.  But I really miss those songs and I also really would like to see the movie again.<BR>With a DVD, I would have both at the same time and even in better quality, and I would also find out something more about the \\"making of\\", so why wait any longer!!!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I was very much looking forward to this movie, after hearing so much hype, and I was not disappointed at all.  I found _Lost in Translation_ to be a poignant and revealing story about an intimate connection that two strangers make thousands of miles from home.  Bill Murray was perfect for the role of Bob Harris, the aging movie star; and Scarlett Johannsen was quite impressive as the young newlywed.  Both are lonely, tired, and out-of-place, but when they find each other, a deep bond forms, and the two actors had a nice chemistry on screen.<br />The movie, is very &quot;low-key&quot;, and there are some silent pans of the Tokyo cityscape, yet, these were among my favorite parts of the movie!  They really conveyed the overall tone of the character's mood.  The movie was also enhanced by a great soundtrack.
B00009TB5G|1.0|The Two Towers is just the worst.  Hobbits are so boring.  The bad guys are so lame, they're werent even any missiles or guns or bombs.  This movie is a grotesque abomination.  Don't see it.  Don't buy it.  And oh yah, the DVD is trash as well - its less appealing than a rat vomit.
0375703764|4.0|While I found the layering to be a bit much (action as recorded by cameras as edited by protaganist as dissected by weird old dude as discovered by weird young dude as filtered by &quot;editors&quot;) and didn't find the story of Johnny Truant to be especially compelling, I thought the typographic wackiness was effective and well done, and I thought the core love/horror story was well done. I didn't nail measuring tape to my floor, but I did sleep with the lights on a time or two.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|For the first time in almost thirty-four years, Christine McVie is not present in a Fleetwood Mac album. And that's a huge change, mind you. The notorious english keyboardist/singer/songwriter, with her charming compositions, was a key part of what made this band make a peaceful transition from hardcore blues, passing through different stages of rock and pop, to the straightforward and exteremely successful adult oriented rock act they were in the late 70's and through the 80's. <br />Of course the sound that defined Fleetwood Mac during those years of success was also constructed by the talents of guitarist/singer/songwriter/producer Lindsey Buckingham and singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks, but it was really the mix of those three extremely different personalities which made classic albums such as Rumours or Tusk be that succesful.<br />Being that said, an album like Say You Will, which does not have that mix, cannot be reviewed with the same criterium that, say, Mirage would have. Even though this still IS Fleetwood Mac (any incarnation of the band with Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass is Fleetwood Mac since they own the name - and this includes the much maligned Time lineup). This time the mix of the obscure and 'enchanted' Nicks songwriting, and the pop experiments of Buckingham is very attractive, but different to what we've heard before.<br />This was originally Buckingham's album, and you can note it, since his songs shine the most when it comes to review track by track. &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; is easily his best song in years, meticulously arranged by almost classical acoustic guitar parts and featuring poignant lyrics about lost love. &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot; is almost the ultimate pop anthem, a very McVie-sounding track which by the way features McVie's collaboration on background vocals. Those would be his two highlights, having also other very good songs (&quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, &quot;Red Rover&quot;, another chance to enjoy Buckingham's masterful and vastly underrated guitar playing) and a pleasant commentary about the world's current situation (&quot;What's The World Coming To&quot;) in his favour. The production varies from good to great in these tracks, but it just goes too over the top in &quot;Come&quot; (weird lead vocals) and most of all &quot;Murrow&quot; (an army of lead guitars in the end). You'd just wish to hear the real thing, which is something that only happens when you hear &quot;Come&quot; live, when the song just comes to real life. On this album it almost sounds out of place.<br />Stevie's tunes are carefully arranged to fit in here. Thus the electro-acoustic sound of Lindsey's guitar follow the songs as they develop with their magic lyrics. Some very fine lyrical work by Nicks is heard here (most notably &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;), and she rescues two of her most precious demos of the past with fairly different results (&quot;Smile At You&quot; is almost ruined by the bass-percussion-high lead vocal arrangement, and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; is favored by the melancholic piano and the moving lead vocal, making it one of the best songs on the album). But she also manages to deliver his worst Fleetwood Mac song to date (&quot;Silver Girl&quot;, featuring memorable lines as &quot;she was a girly girl&quot;), and another song which had excellent intentions, but not really well done, in my opinion (&quot;Illume 9-11&quot;).<br />The title track is almost an attempt to have that Christine sound that the record misses. I'm not saying this is a bad album because McVie is not there. This is a very good collection of individual songs, with some low points here and there - which can always happen if you release an album with 18 songs in it, with attempts to create a more or less homogeneous sound which work in excellent ways at times. <br />Perhaps this actually *sounds* as two separate solo albums (mostly because of the awful running order, which can anyway be changed by programming your stereo the way you want it to sound), only partially joined by the production. But the fact that most of these 'solo' songs are actually excellent, and that, at least from Buckingham's side, it's one of the very best collection of songs he's released in years (Stevie did have a great deliver with her 2001 album Trouble In Shangri-La), makes enough for a great listening time. The chemistry between those two, which began &quot;when love started out in the darkness&quot; creates a tension which can easily be felt in some of the more poignant tracks on the album. And the 'music voyeur' part of most of us will always enjoy that.
B00005JLT5|5.0|My favorite film of 2002 was The Two Towers but I thought Chicago was still a deserving Best Picture winner ...until I saw The Pianist and came to the reason why it won the top awards overseas (BAFTA's Best Film,Cannes film festival's The Golden Palm). I was shocked at how much I was moved emotionally by the end. This is the most emotionally powerful film I've seen in a while. I don't know what else I could say except definitely the film will become a true classic.
B00018D44U|2.0|I loved Nora's last CD with it's warm, piano jazz flavor.  This CD has a few similar songs, but mainly sounds like Nora's record company selected her songs by focus group:  &quot;Let's see, in the last CD, the South didn't buy enough Nora Jones CD's, so let's add some steel guitar, and an Opry star to some songs. That should even out our sales.&quot;  Let's face it, Dolly Parton goes as well with Nora Jones as Alice Cooper goes with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Maybe Ms. Jones will take a more active role in her song selection next time.  I'd like to see her research some of the jazz classics and New Orlean's standards and I hope she finds her voice and her style without relying on a NASCAR pastiche to please everbody.
B0000TB050|2.0|This is the second DVD from the Elevation Tour, with mostly redundant setlists from the Boston DVD.<br />The music and sound quality are superb, but the camera work is the typical MTV-style flashy, fast-cut-jumble where nothing stays in place for more than one second (just like the Boston DVD). If that type of editting annoys you, be prepared for lots of it, including extremely grating close-ups of Bono's face during one song I can't remember, due to dizziness and eye-strain, this video is mostly a visual blur.<br />A wiser decision would have been to release this show as a limited collector's item for the U2 Fanclub, and release the visually superior and more musically inspiring &quot;Popmart From Mexico City&quot; finally on DVD instead. <br />5 stars for the musical content, 0 stars for the editting and camera work.
B000069HK2|3.0|This cd I must say, is overrated, plain and simple.  I heard the Used a long time ago on some small sites where I could sample bands who weren't recognized, and I just heard nothing special.  And then wow! MTV starts playing the Used, and oh gosh they're just do darned popular and cool now!  I mean, Bert McCrackin (or however its spelled) is just so darned cool because he's a chainsmoking crack head.  Anyway I'm more of a MUSIC reviewer, so here's my analysis- Decent.  A bit soft on the screamo spectrum.  It really isn't anything special.  I guess basically if you want a generic band, this is for you, you gray blob of nothing.
B0000041Z3|4.0|Having bought supposedly \\"legendary\\" and \\"landmark\\" Sibelius recordings before and been sorely disappointed, I must confess to having misgivings as soon as I'd pressed the 'order' button for this set.  Would all the praise turn out to be the usual hyperbole?  I shouldn't have worried...<br />There's a real sense of excitement in these recordings and they are full of vitality and character.  The Vienna players bring obvious enthusiasm and drive to these wonderful works but there's great subtlety and a deep understanding of the music too.  So much so that just hearing them play the 1st (a performance that crackles with an energy that matches the vitality and invention of the writing) reminded me of the awe I felt when I first discovered Sibelius several years ago, and I don't think any CDs I've bought since my first purchase of these symphonies has had that effect. <br />I'd agree with most in saying that the highlights are the 4th and 7th - the latter performance really capturing the epic sweep and intense beauty of this masterpiece.  In passing, is there anything more sublime in all music than the first 10 minutes or so of Sibelius' 7th (and the remaining 10 minutes are pretty good too)?  The 1st and the 5th deserve very high praise as well.  The 5th is a work I've always admired more than enjoyed but this account grips me from the first note to the last chord.  I gather that true aficianados of the 5th have reservations about it, however.  Sadly, the 6th is a big disappointment: after a very beautiful opening section it's ruined by very fast tempi in the inner movements and some very rough-hewn playing, and sound, indeed.  The first movement of the 3rd is also taken at breakneck speed but still manages to be a rewarding performance.<br />True, the '60s sound is a bit on the bright side, very occasionally even coarse, and the discs are not completely free of muddled playing and even a little questionable intonation, but these are rare blemishes so don't be put off.You can hardly go wrong at this price anyway, can you? <br />My only caveat would be that I wouldn't really recommend this as your only source of these symphonies - some of the performances are a bit idiosyncratic by current standards for that.  Get some good modern recordings as well.  For very little money you can't beat Adrian Leaper's superb cycle on Naxos or indeed his later recordings for Arte Nova; both of these contain 7ths that - sorry, purists - leave even Mr Maazel's in the shade.  Petri Sakari, also on Naxos, is a good bet too, if a little over praised.  But do invest in this excellent little box.
B00018D44U|5.0|If you liked Norah Jones first release, Come Away With Me, you will LOVE Feels Like Home.  Every song is a winner....soothing and ethereal as only Norah can sing it.  I think this one is even better than the first.  I hope Norah keeps making music like this for a long time to come.
B0000019HU|5.0|To begin to describe the impact this album has had on my musical tastes would use up the allotted space that Amazon provides for review writing.  Chances are you have come to this album by way of the Kids soundtrack, if not then you probably know of Slint through their wide influence.  This is how it happened with me.  I watched the movie Kids.  I purchased the soundtrack because of the Folk Implosion song \\"nothings gonna stop the flo\\".  While listening to that soundtrack, I slowly took a liking to the song \\"good morning captain\\".  At the time, I liked the track because it slowly built itself up to a frenzied Nirvana style ending.<br /> Fast forward a couple of years.  I am browsing through a record store and I stumble across this album.  I decided to buy the album figuring that if gmc was good the other songs must be good.  I was dead on, but I would never have imagined the influence the album had on me.<br /> The first track \\"breadcrumb trail\\" starts off with this high pitched/muted strummed guitar.  It wades back and forth while the \\"singer\\" starts to tell his tale.  You can't help but turn up the volume on the track; the singer speaks in such a low tone.  The guitar, bass and drums weave this intricate pattern that reminds me of bright summer day.  When the chorus kicks in the song begins to assert itself on the listener. .<br /> The second track \\"nosferatu man\\", begins with a very humble bass and drum line.  It's not until the guitar kicks in that you even realize that this track has a groove to it.  Again the vocals are very much like the previous track, and you again have to turn up the volume. This track is also more \\"mathematical\\" than the previous and is much more intense.<br /> The third track \\"don, aman\\", this track surprises me every time I listen to it.  It is so simple yet has a subtle complexity to it that I cannot explain.  It is simple because mainly the music consists of a high pitched muted guitar being strummed in a repetitive rhythm.  The intensity that is built up in this song is very impressive for such a quiet song.  By the end of the track you feel as if you have just heard someone go through a panic attack or some kind of mental breakdown.<br />  The fourth track \\"washer\\" actual singing is heard.  This is the saddest song I have ever heard; it rivals some Joy Division stuff.  Every note and strum of a guitar and drum hit sounds so carefully crafted.  I hear this song and all I can think of is a gray rainy day.  Of course, not all is as it seems, the music picks up and the guitars start to wail and the emotion comes flooding in.<br /> The fifth track \\"for dinner\\", although it might seem like \\"filler\\" should be considered the calm before the storm or the eye of the hurricane.  After many listens, it even sounds a little like the next track, in fact is sets up the next track beautifully.  Think of what this album would be without this track.  To go from washer to good morning captain without a calming interlude, emotion changes too quickly.  Finally, the sixth track, \\"good morning captain\\".  My friends and I say if we had to choose one song playing endlessly in ours heads until we die, it would be this song.  I think that is ironic considering the story of this track deals with an individual in isolation and the things going through his mind.  It has so many elements to like; I will not mention them here.  It has to be heard in order to be believed.<br /> This album remains in the top 5 albums I own.  It will change your tastes in music if you approach it with an open mind.  Be prepared to be amazed at the musical craft that went into it, I know I was and still am.t is built up in this song is very impressive for such a quiet song.

1563899426|5.0|Subverting expectations and inverting cliches is one thing, but Fables is also a book with heart underneath its undeniable style.<br />The art by Lan Medina is deceptively good: at first glance it looks fairly standard but covers all the basics of storytelling, creates some interesting visuals and is attractive to look at. More importantly it serves the story and is one of the major reasons it works so well.<br />But the book is all about the story. Willingham takes a good premise and runs with it. The characters are engaging and seem human, despite their origin. The climax of the story is a little staged and generic, but everything else about the story (including the actual explanation) sparkles. Overall, one of the best Vertigo books of recent years.
B0000024RB|5.0|Outstanding!  Andy Williams performs like nobody else can.  It forever reminds me of the \\"good old days\\" and how life, movies and music went hand-in-hand.  I treasure it dearly and guarantee it will be one of your most prized possessions.  I've listened to it for 40 years and I'm still overwhelmed by the beautiful songs and the wonderful memories they bring to life.  <BR>It is simply too beautiful for words.
0553573403|5.0|An excellent start to the series.  The first two books are very strong while the third is a bit weak.  Would recommend it as great read.  Fresh and new.

B0000634EV|5.0|I was listening to my local radio station today, and after hearing Linkin Park for about the 500th time I decided to put in a C.D.  As usual I picked Down.  It seems like I always pick either Down II or Nola, and there is good reason for this.  They are two of the greatest metal albums ever released!  In fact, Down II may be the last really good metal album released since the turn of the century.  Some of the reviewers have noted that Down II is not as good as Nola and I would have to agree, Nola was one of the best records of any genre ever released, however Down II is definetely in my top 10 greatest albums list.  The thing that makes this group great is the fact that they are being true to themselves and thier art, not just trying to make a commercial album to appease thier corporate record label masters.  This album did take a couple of spins for me to get into, mainly because I had such high expectations for it, but once I got into it, it stayed in my C.D. player for a long time.  It sucks that Pantera have disbanded, especially since the Superjoint and Damageplan records are, although worth buying, mediocre at best and not suitable replacements for the mighty Pantera.  Had Phil left Pantera to focus on Down, however, I might not have been as upset with thier breakup, because this band is that friggin' good!  The bottom line is that you should buy this album, in fact you should buy two of them because you will probably wear the first one out.
B00006690G|1.0|he was awesome in the movie &quot;cool as ice&quot; though.
B0000CFWZA|1.0|Those are the words to describe Nickleback's latest album.  They relied on the same formulas for this abortion.  There is nothing new here.  Same old songs, some old riffs.  These guys have absolutly no artisic integrity.  Their lates single is offensive and shouldn't be allowed to be played on the radio.  It's disgusting and less than subtle.  Chad Krouger, please retire, you're not welcome here.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is just unbelievably boring!<br />Let me tell you a little story. I never wanted to watch this movie in the first place, but when the Oscar nominations hit the world I thought &quot;OK, they don't nominate for Oscar for nothing.&quot; So, I rented (thank God, I did not buy it) this movie.<BR>I honestly tried to find the seeds of greatness or comedy in it. I did not find a trace of either. If you consider two jokes on cultural differences enough to call this movie a comedy, then OK, I agree, it's a comedy. As for the dramatic aspects, please spare me, there are so many literary works where this subject has been exhaustively developed that I don't even know where to begin the list of my reccomendations.<br />Overall, if you want a good comedy watch &quot;Intolerable Cruelty.&quot; I really enjoyed all the plot twists. And if you want a good drama get married ;-). <br />After all, if you want to experience loneliness with the purpose of catharsis, read a good book.<br />Don't waste your money on this movie, you'll regret it.<br />Thank you for reading this,<BR>Anton
B0000696I1|2.0|God shoot those poor things!!! The director absolutely SCREWED THE TURTLES UP!!! They look so much like frogs!!!!!! The animatronics make me cry!!!! The voices kill me literally!!!! Splinter I want to SHOOT because he's so horrible in this movie! The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star is because of Yoshi (he's so adorable!) and Casey Jones and the four Japanese dudes. April was somebody I wanted to just slaughter with a mace. Has anyone noticed that she changes personality in all three?? Nope. Don't like NT 3. But the ninja/karate moves are pretty cool. Either than that....put this thing out of its misory.
0385504209|1.0|Oh yeah, I know it's supposed to be a fictional thriller about  symbolism and mysterious puzzles; but there is a message here that is not well hidden or cloaked in secrecy: The attempt to discredit the claims of true Christianity, the innerancy of scripture, and the deity of Christ.  (See chapter 55)
B0000696I0|5.0|Okay, cheesy title, I personally hate Vanilla Ice, but I loved this movie. There was more humor in it, and the turtles were fun. The first one was absolutely thrilling, and this one matched it quite nicely. I personally like the looks of the turtles better in #2. I also like Donny's voice better. I love Corey Feldman, but whoever did Donny in #2 was really good. Raph was the best looking turtle, and his accent was so perfect!!!! GO RAPH!!! The mouth movements of the turtles in this one were much better, and I loved the humor. I didn't really care for Keno, but yah. He was cool too I guess. Some people don't like the fact that this one is more cartoonish in appearance, sound and storyline, but it started out as a cartoon, why not make it a bit more cartoony? Okay, I could live if there was less humor, but YA GOTTA LOVE MIKEY!!!! Yeah, so out of the trilogy, the second one was my favorite. (I LOVE DONNY!!!)
B00003CXXP|5.0|The morality of this movie is spelled out in the beginning of this movie; therefore, I don't think that's the main plot (or the question) of this extraordinarily &quot;crafted&quot; movie.  The real question, I believe, here is what makes us human.  Not only David (Haley Osment) was made to love his parents as any other &quot;real&quot; children but also to persue his own dreams which in this case is a fairytale.  But aren't most our dreams like that -- especially our childhood dreams?  In this sense, David got his wish, even if it was only for a day.  Perhaps he continued to &quot;dream&quot; at the end with his mother on his side.<br />The first question, &quot;can a human love a robot,&quot; is then answered with Monica, David's mother, saying, &quot;I have always loved you,&quot; at the end.<br />This movie is remarkably inspirational and is a very good portrayal of humanity.  If you are after SCI-FI action movies, however, this is not for you.
B00005JLKB|3.0|I would recommend skipping this season, and saving your money for season 2, due out this spring, which will actually HAVE extras.
B000089RVX|3.0|this album is another MTV overrated album. even though is a thousand times beter than linkin park or limbizkit(if there is a difference between this bands)there still a missing creativity in the music. there are some good cuts here(the immortal, tourniquete,the haunted) whith her god given voice but the band in fact is too repetitive(nu-metal) and the song breng me to life is ruined by that stupid rapper but after all i'll recommend it
B00004TFFS|5.0|It has been suggested that several U2 album titles are coming on SA-CD high resolution discs. This listing was seen as a pre-order for such an item and I added it to my rumor list.<br />However, since there is no release date or any official looking information, it looks more like an error. Can anyone confirm or deny on these U2 SA-CD &quot;listings&quot;?
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you would have asked me the day I bought this album, or even a week after, I would have told you it deserved 3 stars at the most. It's funny, how did I fall for the same thing again? Ok Computer was the same way to me. It required multiple listenings to fully appreciate it's brilliance....and after I realized how good it was.....it just got better. The thing about Radiohead is...they don't stick to a strict writing style or formula. There music is very unpredictable and varied style(from song to song). For instance: in 'Go to Sleep', I bet everyone thought it was going to go back to it's origin after it changed to the part about 'monsters' being tied down. So, reletively short into the song it changed to a vamp that ultimately fades the song out. &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; is probably one of the most original pieces of music I have ever heard. The harmonies creep me out to no end. The melody structure is so complex and awekwardly executed (appropriately nonetheless) that it requires you to study it to grasp it's purpose and eventually it's brilliance. I would liken Radiohead to Debussy at the turn of the 20th century and 'The Beatles' in the 1960's. They are expanding the 'empire of sound'. Don't try to hear what you don't like. Just let it play and listen to it. Let it flow in your head. They construct there songs based on what they want the mood to be, instead of trying to have....ok a bridge here, a chorus here, then another bridge, and back to the beginning. It's not like that. They create soundscapes within each song. Something not alot of bands can do. This album is one of the best examples of that unique talent they have.
B000002HAJ|5.0|Just turned 50 and my idols include Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, Led Zeplin  and The Cure.  In other words I am a man of taste. I can easily say,interms of versatilty and depth, this is one of the best rock albums out there.  Well worth the money !!!!
B00006GO99|5.0|Monk's work with this quartet is so fluid and tight. These guys were really working off the same page. Monk's playing here is innovative and very upbeat. Just listen to what he did with Body and Soul. His version is one of the most unusual yet musically satisfying renditions I've ever heard. Monk's compositions are unbelievably cool and he found the perfect group of musicians to bring his musical vision to reality with Charlie Rouse John Ore and Frank Dunlop. This is highly entertaining jazz and swings throughout.
0312263120|2.0|The idea is intelligent, but the books feels like you are going thru a bunch of people having a really bad day. Everything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong in this book.<br />I made it to page 255 but wanted to give it up a 100 pages back. All that keeps me going is the thought that hopefully the conclusion is worth the trouble of wading thru another 250 pages. It's like a cyber soap opera! The author, Dan Brown keeps stretching things. I bought the book because of all the talk about his latest book, The Da Vinci Code. I'm waiting for that book to come out in paperback and so I thought this book will give me an idea of how Mr. Brown writes. Now I'm having second thoughts about The Da Vinci Code. Will it be just as numbing as this one?<br />This book is just another pot boiler. Sheesh!
0671027344|5.0|I will not 'flame' and claim that this is the &quot;best book ever&quot; as is stated in many reviews listed.  I do not have illusions of grandeur nor, I believe, does Chbosky.  It must be said however, that no book has ever caused me to cry three times in 200 pages.  No book has ever made me want to sit down and write an author a thank you note.  No book has ever caused me to ask the person who recommended it to autograph my copy of the book so I could always remember how grateful I was for that person's excellent recommendation.  No book except for this one.  Steinbeck it is not.  Hemmingway would probably laugh at it.  Frankly, after reading it I couldn't care less and I am sure you will not either.  The writing is above average, the story is familiar in ways that re-fire old memories, old feelings, and old insecurities.  Layed open are your adolescent wounds only to be healed again.  This novel is about the characters, the story, and adolescence - not constructing the perfect paragraph.  I recommend it fully to those who have ever wondered what it would be like to &quot;feel infinite&quot; or anyone who has ever been considered a &quot;wallflower.&quot;
B00008H2LB|5.0|If Linkin Park isn't already your favourite band, Meteora will change that. This record is fantastic, more than I could have asked for! My favourite song is Numb. I appreciate the musicality and art that LP takes into consideration when writing their songs, making them all the better. Not one song on this album will dissapoint! p.s. the Grammys suck royal for nominating them only once (for Session).They didn't even win! That's insanity!
B000001FTD|5.0|Among The Living(1987). Anthrax's third studio album.<br />Back in the mid 80s, a genre of frantic heavy metal music known as thrash metal was beginning to emerge from the shadows of the east and west coasts with big name bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, and Anthrax. While the four former bands emerged in the San Francisco Bay west coast area, Anthrax originated in New York on the east coast and brought many unique aspects to the thrash metal scene. Comprised of vocalist Joey Belladonna, lead guitarist Dan Spitz, rhythm guitarist Scott Ian, drummer Charlie Benante, and bassist Frank Bello, Anthrax is a band about delivering songs full of raw energy, memorable riffs, and endless headbanging. Even though the more famous Metallica and Megadeth were influenced by the NWOBHM scene, Anthrax sports an almost punk-like quality to it, in addition to the insurmountable ammount of heavy metal power. To me, Anthrax has some of the greatest thrash musicians to ever grace heavy metal. Spitz churns out some AMAZING solos. Scott has incredible rhythm guitar talent (second only to Iced Earth's Jon Schaffer). Charlie  manages to be an excellent drummer, and even Bello's bass playing stands out quite a bit. But to me, what separates Anthrax from all the other thrash metal bands is that they have the best thrash vocalist. James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine have NOTHING on Belladonna. Unlike the shouting and screaming that most thrash metal vocalists employ, Belladonna can actually sing WELL. His melodic vocals manage to dominate the songs on top of all the frantic instrumentation that's going on. With the talented playing and sheer power that erupts in each song, one can't help but be impressed by Anthrax. <br />The band started out in 1984 with Fist Full Of Metal and then released the masterpiece thrash album Spreading The Disease(1985). Among The Living was actually the album that got the band really noticed among the legions of metalheads. While Spreading The Disease is an excellent Anthrax album, ATL has the most punch to it and it's definitely their most powerful 80s album. The production is much more crisp and the guitar sound here easily dwarfs the one used on the previous album. Anyone could think that the guitars were straight out of a Metallica album, but the flavor of it all is undeniably Anthrax. The only setback on this album is that Belladonna shouts more here than before, which is a shame because his best voice comes instead from the singing. Still, there's no shortage of catchy anthemic choruses to sing along to, so this isn't any serious drawback. Just press play and prepare to be amazed (if you like thrash metal, that is). <br />ATL kicks off with a pleasantly powerful one-two punch in the title track and 'Caught In A Mosh'. 'I Am The Law' is an ode to the comic book Judge Dredd, though done in a non-cheezy manner. Of course, 'Efilnikufesin' is a stellar headbanger with a backwards subliminal message contained that's easy to guess (Strange how the media pressured Judas Priest for a song with a subliminal message that wasn't even there, and yet Anthrax really has one and gets away with it!) Next is the Stephen King inspired 'Skeleton In The Closet' which never fails to please, followed by the anthemic 'Indians'. 'One World' and 'Imitation Of Life' are pure thrash muscle numbers, while A.D.I. is the album's lengthy melodic track. All in all, a good collection of thrash songs with nary a moment of filler to be found anywhere.<br />I actually just bought this album yesterday, but after listening to it 3 times in a row, I wish I had bought it sooner. It's albums like this that remind me of why I wish I had grown up in the 80s, which was a time of prospering heavy metal music. Bands such as Metallica, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Testament were in their golden years. Instead I'm stuck in the now surrounded by the horrificly embarrassing Nu-metal scene, of which I hate with a passion. Everyone around me is obsessedwith no-talent bands like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, KoRn, and Slipkot, and I have no interest in any of it. Though thrash wasn't the most popular metal scene at the time (hair metal actually was), even hair metal is better than what you'll hear on the radio now. With Megadeth and Metallica compromising their sound to an extent (the latter band did it to the point of becoming absolutely unlistenable), Anthrax, along with Testament, remains one of the true metal bands to this day who still retain their signature thrash sound. ATL is one great example of what heavy metal is all about. It gets 4.5 stars hands down. Any true metalhead already has this album in their collection, and if you don't, then make this your next purchase. BUY THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH SPREADING THE DISEASE AND PERSISTENCE OF TIME.<br />HEAVY METAL FOREVER!!
0679879269|5.0|The final chapter in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" chronicles and it's a doozy.  Leave it to Philip Pullman to come up with the slam bang finale to end all slam bang finales.  In this last look at his beloved protagonists Lyra and Will (until he publishes their new adventures, that is), the forces of earth, heaven, and a myriad of different worlds have aligned for a final battle for the destiny of humankind and the fate of life/death itself.  Booga booga.<br />There is some debate as to whether or not this is the weakest book of the saga.  The book is filled with vast and complex ideas and new and interesting creatures, but there are a couple questions left unanswered at the end.  Why was Dr. Malone the serpent?  How exactly did Will and Lyra change the movement of Dust?  Admittedly, these questions may be answered in the future.  Pullman isn't done with this world yet.  Some might say he's only just started, and this book is expertly woven.  With additional characters and plotlines mixed and mingled into a big furry series of battles, he doesn't leave the reader feeling unsatisfied.  Just a little sad.  And after all, isn't that how most good books should end?
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to say reading the reviews and seing that no-one bothers to mention &quot;The Hook Up&quot; best second song in the album, i think its sounds kinda like a jamaican vibed its is realy good. The best one is Toxic the beat the lyrics everything is good, all the other song are very good too exept those that are techno related. In all its a good album and her best so far, nice one.
B0001906O0|5.0|Most of my Cure CDs from the mid 80s and earlier are Imports and I have quite a few CD singles plus a CD of B- Sides called &quot;besides&quot; that my wife ordered a few years back (ended up being a bootleg) so I thought I had an extensive library of The Cure. With 308 songs by The Cure in my CD collection I was surprised to find out I only had  27 of the 70 tracks in this new collection! And the liner notes are great!  I thought I knew most of the history of The Cure but after reading the liner notes I see I didn't!  This is a must have for Cure fans!  As other reviewers have stated put Carnage Visors on CD, I have never gotten to hear it but have been looking for it since the late 80s!
0060090367|3.0|I didn't really love this book, nor did I dislike it. I feel pretty neutral about it. It is the sort of story that I will not think of again after I finished it, yet I am glad that I read it.<br />The story begins with Claire, a sweet Irish woman, who is dumped by her husband in the hospital delivery room after she gives birth to their only child. It is told from Claire's perspective, and it is the story of her healing and moving on after the traumatic incident of her husband's abandonment. The book is quite funny and you will like most of the characters. You will find yourself cheering for Claire to get over her selfish and disrespectful husband. The ending is excellent and it leaves you with a happy feeling and a smile.<br />Claire and her family can be found again in other Marian Keyes books. So far, I like &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; better than &quot;Watermelon&quot;. I do have all of Marian Keyes other books, and I am planning on reading them in the near future.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is a rare and wonderful film.  It is set in a small seaside Maori village in New Zealand and concerns the chief, who has no first-born grandson to carry on the old ways.  He does have a loveable and plucky granddaughter, Pai, named for the legendary founder of the Maoris who came there on the back of a whale.  Pai adores her grandfather, but he has forbidden her to study the old ways because she is a girl.<br />This is one of those movies that draws you into its world completely with its honesty.  The Maori world comes alive thanks to the Maori cast and one can easily relate to the universal themes of love, rejection, disappointment, and courage.  The 12-year old star, Keisha Castle-Hughes is so genuine and charismatic, it is no wonder she has been nominated for a Best Actress Oscar.  She is a natural talent, beautiful, inspiring, and delightful to watch.<br />Whale Rider has the art-house feel to it, because it deals almost exclusively with emotions.  Village life and underwater scenes of whales are lovingly photographed and accompanied by a haunting score. There is a lot of Maori culture in it, but the desire for acceptance and respect are universally understood.  If you like character-driven stories with heartwarming elements of the supernatural, you'll enjoy Whale Rider.
B000002J1O|5.0|Selling England By the Pound is an incredible musical achievement. Everything came together for the band on this album. They would never again achieve the cohesiveness and synergy that they found here. The album is a quantum leap above their previous four. Their folllow-up, The Lamb Lies Down, was marred by division and disatisfaction within the band, a plodding and obscure story, and the need for too  much filler to extend the album to two discs. Selling England was the band at its creative peak as a 5 piece unit where each member contributed to every song. Each band member plays some of the best music that they ever would in their careers. Give your ears and mind a treat, listen to this album loud, by candle light, with a nice bottle of wine. Amazing stuff.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Simply awful!!!<BR>After seeing the glorious Hollywood ads eulogizing the theatrical masterpiece, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, I was determined not to miss another supposedly great movie.  But, little did I know the emotional pain and mental anguish this movie would dragged me through.  102 long excruciating minutes of pure boredom.  Anyone who can establish a plot or even a worthwhile excuse to sit through the foreign dialogue and lack of entertainment this movie presents deserves a medal.  I wish someone would have gave me forewarning before sitting through this absolutely mindless torture.

B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a breath of fresh air, in a summer (2003) of dissapointing movies, and less than perfect sequels. Nemo is another masterpiece from Disney and Pixar. Although not as good as &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Nemo is still easily the best picture of the year so far. Entertaining on all levels, as well as fun for the whole family.
6305181772|3.0|Cruise & company have a good action movie going here. It has some some very good actors doing some good acting in it, it has some excellent cinematography, some jam-up stuntwork, some way cool CGI imagery, some really fine soundtrack work, and some snappy direction from a name brand director. As some reviewers below have noted, the tunnel train sequence is truly awesome...one of the best \\"kiss your b--- goodbye\\" moments in recent action film history. A stunner.<BR>  If Tom Cruise and his production company had called this movie something like...oh....\\"Deathwatch\\", or \\"Blowback\\", or some such and gone with it as an action-thriller spy movie about a special covert ops unit of the CIA, DIA, or military intelligence thrown into an emergency situation with a traitor in their midst, I, myself, and undoubtedly a lot of others, would have been fine with it. Most likely I'd have given this film a five-star review.<BR>   I didn't do that because what Cruise & Company elected to do was to appropriate the rights to the old, dearly-loved \\"Mission Impossible\\" spy series---most likely because they thought the jazzy, iconic Lalo Shifrin theme music was \\"cool as h---\\" and because the preposterous idea of latex facial makeups that one could peel off in an instant on the run looked too hard to resist<BR>as a fun plot gimmick. <BR>   If those elements were all that truly composed Mission Impossible then this new version should have been piece of cake acceptancewise with the public. But it hasn't been, for the same reason some of these other movie adaptations of popular tv shows haven't been....because there is an arrogance in Hollywood that relates to televison vs. \\"CINEMA\\". The Hollywood attitude is one of \\"We know how to do these things better than you do, tv, so stand aside and let us show you how\\". Recent duds like \\"The Avengers\\" and \\"The Wild Wild West\\" show us clearly that Hollywood does NOT know how to do it \\"better' than television. They just know how to do it bigger, flashier,and smarmier. Content-wise, classic tv usually comes out miles ahead.<BR>   An earlier reviewer of this film here at Amazon, Barry Chow, hit the nail on the head when he said this Cruise version betrays its heritage. That's exactly what it does. Mission Impossible (and its team) was about stealth and guile; about putting one over on somebody and leaving them none the wiser until it was too late. It was a CAPER concept, closer in intent to \\"The Sting\\" than to \\"True Lies\\". In fact that is what each of the IM Force's missions WERE...\\"Stings\\"....not Detonation Derbys. Cruise & Company seem to have forgotten this...or never understood it in the first place. And the power of the real \\"MI\\" was that it was, at heart, an ENSEMBLE show (like \\"Friends\\" on t.v., or \\"E.R.\\"), with the TEAM pulling the scams on their target victims. A \\"team\\" is vaguely depicted in this Cruise version, but basically...in music terms...as Ethan Hunt's \\"side men\\". The thrust of this story's interaction is actually Ethan Hunt, Secret Agent, vs. the \\"Mysterious Traitor\\".<br />   And it is the identity of this sleazy, ruthless,double-dealing scumbucket of a traitor that is at the root of all the \\"boomer' backlash against this movie. And most justifiably so. They have made him Jim Phelps. And to all Americans everywhere who \\"grew up with Jim Phelps\\", this little plot device is utterly outrageous. Beyond the pale. A lot of the <br />\\"gen X\\" and younger crowd truly DON'T understand why this movie ticks so many people off. It's because a popular \\"hero\\" figure to a couple of generations of Americans has been turned...for the sake of 'edginess\\"...into an odious sleazeball. and that doesn't sit well with a lot of people...AT ALL. If you don't understand the annoyance, try this...try waiting ten or fifteen years down the road and then buying your ticket to see the movie version of \\"Friends\\", where you'll find that Ross is a serial killer, Rachel is a cannibal, and Joey a Nazi transvestite. And when you get madbecause you know full well that this is NOT who these people are and NOT what they're about then maybe you'll start getting a glimmer of why this review only deals Tom Cruise 3 stars instead of 5.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Beautiful. Just plain beautiful is all I can say.<br />First let me address the crazy reviews I've read saying that this film is somehow racist. Ridiculous. First off, I am Japanese and have lived there many years, and I was only charmed by the movie. The protrayal of the Japanese in this film is entirely accurate. They don't rely on stupid stereotypes (like all Japanese people are submissive and against individuality), as shown by &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; and his friends. Sure, a lot of them bow for no reason, but THAT IS JAPAN. Sure, they can't pronounce &quot;r&quot;'s, but THAT IS JAPAN. In no way does the movie make fun of these oddities.<br />With that NONSENSE aside, this is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. I found myself lost in the beautifully shot scenes, and still frames from the movie could probably be put in museums. It is that great. <br />This movie is not for hyper-active kids on ridilin who want action. It is for people who can lose themselves in paintings or pictures and can appreciate true beauty.
B000089RW0|1.0|Why do directors insist on imitating crappy movies over and over again? They should at least imitate the good ones. I guess it's our fault for paying for the movies over and over again. For starters, lets ignore the fact that this plot has been done an infinate amount of times and let's also overlook the fact that this is a &quot;horror movie&quot; with friendly ghosts (I was expecting Kasper to lend a hand). What are we left with? A lame acted imitation of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, throw in a little event horizon and House on Haunted Hill and viola! I find it funny that people point out the wire scene as a reason this movie was scary. Well, I was not aware that randomly inserting graphic gore passes as horror. I always thought there should be some tension, mixed in with eerie music, smart lighting, clever camera angles, developing characters that the audience can connect with, interesting plot, etc. ... Nope, I guess the sheeps of society are happy with a sharp wire that chops 40 people in half. It's amazing that these are the standards we have set. Oh and by the way, if you were astonished by the &quot;surprise ending&quot; well then my friend, Sherlock Holmes you are not...
0060512806|4.0|This book differs from other works of Neal Stephenson (at least, that I've read, such as 'Snow Crash' and 'Diamond Age') since it's not about the future but more about the past. There were quite a lot of books written about code breaking wars during World War II but this one is definitely unique (well, no less would be expected from the writer). The book has very interesting characters, very good story with all kinds of technical observations and considerations embedded in it. Having said this I must say that the book is not an easy read. I cannot take on myself to say that it is bloated. Yes, it is big (in volume) and there are many times when I thought that particular description or explanation has nothing to do with the theme of the book. But in the end, who knows, maybe it all serves the purpose. I wouldn't agree with some reviewers who criticized the ending of the novel. I believe the reason it's happening (and the same could be said about other Neal Stephenson books) that we expect his novel to end on some extraordinary note, matching the spirit of whole book. I guess it's very difficult thing to do. At the same time, I find the ending to be quite adequate. Highly recommended to all Neal Stephenson fans (who, I am sure, don't need my recommendations) and computer geeks. For others it will probably better to start from some other works of this author, such as famous 'Snow Crash'.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|After reading a selection of prior reviews here at amazon, it's obvious that LOST IN TRANSLATION isn't for everybody...<br />Who might it be for?  For one, someone who is more into character close-ups than plot twists.  The whole movie is about getting under the surface of Bob and Charlotte (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson) at a brief, intersecting point in their lives, two Americans half a world away in Tokyo.  Timewise, the movie covers roughly 3-4 days ... which doesn't allow for much in the way of plot surprises.  The movie is effective in stepping the viewer into their shoes: it INTENDS to reflect a sense of intermittent boredom.  In my opinion without actually being a boring movie, but that I would say is where reviewers take sides.  Frankly, I can see why some think this movie is a chore to sit through.  On the other hand, I can hardly wait to see it again.  <br />Also, what does one expect from a Bill Murray movie?  Here the spry wit that has saved many otherwise forgettable movies is mostly subdued, as befits a middle-aged has-been actor (not Murray himself, of course I mean the role he's playing here).  If you can block out memories of the often-hilarious energy Murray brought to previous roles, then I believe his efforts in L.I.T. can be better appreciated by those who don't already see &quot;best actor award&quot; in his performance.  L.I.T. seems more a &quot;dramedy,&quot; and I think some of the movie trailers create expectations more in line with Murray's past films than the one it is attempting to sell.  This movie is imo on the &quot;other side&quot; of GROUNDHOG DAY from the starting point of such B.M. feel-good vehicles as STRIPES or GHOSTBUSTERS.<br />As far as how Japan is portrayed, I'd say L.I.T. does present a wide cross-section of Japanese people, from business professionals to bizarre television hosts.  To the extent that particular scenes do focus on some of the wackier aspects of Japanese pop culture, I'd say that this is another example of director Coppola attempting to look at Tokyo through the eyes of the lead characters, both of whom are experiencing culture shock (not to mention jet-lag) and thus more likely to see their surroundings in a skewed manner (and being that this is a movie, if the director opts to represent that bias he/she has to visualize it, which is likely to involve a bit of stereotyping).  Overall, L.I.T. gets my two thumbs up, but I would say to any potential buyers who aren't familiar with the film to check out other reviews -- those who love it AND those who pan it.  Because TRANSLATION is the type of off-center movie that will polarize audiences.  As such I rated it four stars, although for me it's a five star film.
B00005JKZU|2.0|There are some records out there that have two or three good songs and the other ones are just boring filler material. In fact, I would bet that most albums are precisely like that. Well, this second &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; episode proves that this kind of situations also happens with movies. I mean, this picture is well directed, the acting is competent and the sceneries and locations are excellent. But, for the most part, it`s an uninteresting, repetitive and long movie with few standout moments. It drags for about three hours, and at least two seem like lifeless and dull filler.<br />&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was average either, but I was more tolerant since it was the first part of the trilogy and I could deal with the whole introductory scenes and the nonexistent character development. However, this second movie doesn`t get any better and still presents structural problems and an uneven pacing. When I was about to quit, something mildly engaging kept happening only to return to flat situations again. This flawed rythm persists during most of the movie, and at the end I thought this was an average flick at best. <BR>Some characters hold promise, but they are never developed and seem like one (or two, in excepcional cases) dimensional individuals. Frodo`s dangerous obssession with the ring was interesting, yet it only became more gripping during the last minutes of the movie, after a tiresome and tedious battle sequence. I admit the cliffhanger at the end kept me somewhat curious about the third part, but with little excitement. <br />Director Peter Jackson has done quirky films in the past (&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; was a much, much better &quot;fantasy&quot; movie than this overrated and disappointing trilogy) but here he isn`t more than a competent, by-the-numbers taskmaster. This is just another action-oriented flick with a tepid score and appealing eye candy. I`m really losing faith on this epic story.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is a certified classic, yeah you read right, classic.  This is a good combination of great beats with great lyrics and word play.  Kanye doesn't have to talk about guns and drugs, he raps real life.  The track &quot;Last Call&quot; explains his rise to the top after the rap is over.  The track &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; with Jay-Z is one of the highlights as well as &quot;All Falls Down&quot; and &quot;Family Business.&quot;  Kanye tries the religious route and succeeds with &quot;Jesus Walks.&quot;  He even has his own workout, &quot;The New Workout Plan.&quot;  This album gets and will continue to get heavy rotation in my cd player.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is a band with the capabilities of bringing fans of a band like phish and hardcore fans to the same venue. This album is amazing it jams like hell, all the intensity of atdi is still present, but at the same time you could dance/groove to this music for hours. The guitar riffs are undescribable these guys are truly breaking new ground. I highly suggest this album to any open minded music fan. peace
0380789019|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite book ever.  Neil Gaiman expertly creates a world on the edge of our own, where fantasy and reality meet.  <BR>I'm at a loss for words, this book is so good.  Go read it.  Now.  You'll thank yourself.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I was reading the lower reviews to see what idiots had to say, and you can obviously see they are quite uneducated. First off, Kanye admits to sampling, but his beats are still HOT! Second, Slow Jamz is def Kanye's song, ask Twista. And Most of the Songs aren't skits, there's still 14 songs on album. Anyway, to the album...I don't buy albums, I just mad download. I went to FYE and previewed this album and just had to buy it. I came back and listened to it. So far, it's gone fully through 4 times. I can't get enough, this cat is hot. He's spittin str8 from the heart and it's a nice change to a lot of everyday rap, which I also enjoy. But this album is hot 1-21...true, I skip skits, but all songs are worth listening to. And if you don't like this album, you don't get it...So please stop hatin on Kanye.
B000002AS3|4.0|since the release of definitely maybe in 1996(i think) oasis have continued to produce quality music but in my view not as good as their debut. this is one of the best albums i have heard in a long time and gives the manchester lads the crown of brit rock kings! songs like'shaker maker,live forever' and 'supersonic' are rare genious with the compelling lyrics that make liams voice rain through your speakers and soak you to the bone!! you'll thank me afterwards
B000002UA0|5.0|I had this album on vinyl about 20 years ago, and loved it then.  Now that I am older, I can appreciate the true genius of Syd Barrett even further. So sad that his star burned so brightly for so short a time!
B000003TAR|5.0|i am a big nirvana fan and i think that this was their high point. it combinds punky riffs with poetic lyrics and deserves to be at the top of your record collection. this album shows the deeper side of cobain and brings out the details of his troubled life in the lyrics and with cobains voice becomes an instant classic,such songs as 'heart shaped box' and 'radio friendly unit shifter' are a must for you to listen too. this album proves that nirvana were the most important band since the beatles. buy it!!
B00008H2LB|1.0|Ok, if you like this band, or are thinking about liking this band, you basically only have two excuses.  <BR>1. You don't know any better<BR>2. You should know better, but don't<BR>If you belong to the first category, there are better bands than this.  You probably hear about bands through mtv or the radio, and there could be two no worse sources for musical input. (Aside from stupid friends)  This is CORPORATE ROCK.  Basically, anything corporate cannot possibly be music, because it is simply crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator in our society.  Seriously, read some of these reviews.  As for musical complexity, there isn't any.  Two or three power chords a song, and the same boring time signature throughout.  And as for lyrics, they're all about the same crap.  The random patterns created by bird poop on a windshield would be more likely to produce intelligent lyrics than these morons.  Actually, it's probably not even LP who writes their songs, but some fifty-year-old suit who is experienced at writing crap that appeals to 14-year-olds.  Now, I'm not simply an elitest underground metalhead, but an elitist underground metalhead who *used* to be a 14-year-old who listened to LP's first album because I didn't know better.  Then I finished puberty, and mental maturity allowed me to see what LP isn't, which is good.  After that I promptly melted Hybrid Theory.  Well, if you're interested in not being ignorant, start listening to some good music.  I started with Metallica's good albums (that means pre black album <BR>people) and went on from there.  I don't expect anyone starting from scratch to immdiately enjoy bands like Meshuggah, as do some reviewers here, but that would be a good end goal.  If you can actually enjoy Meshuggah, you are an elitist underground metalhead, more or less.  <BR>Now, for you people in the second category, who SHOULD know better but don't, SHAME ON YOU.  If you really think Linkin Park is a good band, you need help.  Of the shotgun-blast-to-the-head variety.  ON the other hand, if you are willing to admit your slavery to corporate America, and repent your evil ways (and not the good kind of evil ways), then hurry the hell up and listen to some good music, before you are lost to the dark side forever.<BR>By the way, in response to all the corporate slaves who state that \\"Linkin Park's Meteora was the top selling rock album of 2003, so it must be good\\": guess what.  The average American is very, very, VERY stupid.  And if you want to be no more than average, be my guest.  But don't try to drag other people down into the Slough of Despond with you to wallow in fecal matter like Linkin Park.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has created a worthwhile thriller unlike any other mystery novel I've ever read. Though it contains the same characteristics as other novels; an adventure, a mystery to be solved; it is a novel that keeps you guessing to the end. However, the difference with this mystery is that the clues are woven into historical facts and art symbolism that has its origins from the time of Jesus through the Renaissance. The story is catapulted through the unexpected adventures of a symbology professor and his cryptographer partner who must uncover clues to discover the truth of the story of Jesus.<br />Jacques Sauniere, a curator, and grandfather to Sophie Neveu is brutally murdered in the Louvre museum. After hearing of her grandfather's death Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer tries to uncover his codes, which lead her to partner up with Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of symbology. Together, they go from clue to clue, uncovering Jacques Sauniere's secret past, and the truth to Sophie's family. A variety of characters are added in this plot; an acolyte, trying to keep the past a secret, a multi-millionaire, with a quest to find the key to history, and a stubborn police officer, determined to arrest the murderer of Jacques Sauniere.<br />Being a non-religious person, oblivious to the history of Christianity, I have taken to this topic and gained a new perspective on religious belief.  \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has accurate historic facts that educate readers, like me, about the mysteries of the Christian church that most people aren't even aware of. I have looked at religion on a new level, and have learned that history can be written to fit the interpretation of the church or other institutions. The interpretation of the history of the time of Jesus has definitely affected our view of the roles of gender in society and many of the superstitions some believe today. This novel is remarkable in that it teaches new ways of viewing the past and at the same time entertains the reader, making this book a must-read for anyone.der, making this book a must-read for anyone.

0743243153|5.0|Dr. Peck has a very easy writing style and a keen sense of his concepts.  I really enjoyed this book, so much so, I was sad when I finished it - so I bought Further Along the Road...  Anyway, Dr. Peck does have an interesting concept to tell you about after he establishes the concept of love.  I wholeheartedly agree with his ideas, but some may be offended if they cannot accept it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Ever since \\"Bring Me to Life\\" hit the airwaves, I have been addicted to Evanescence, but it wasn't until \\"My Immortal\\" hit the radio, that I bought the \\"Fallen\\" cd. From there on out I was addicted to the whole cd.<br />The whole cd is very dark and moody. It's great to just sit back and chill to. All the songs on \\"Fallen\\" seem to be about pain and reflection of that pain. Whatever the situation seems to be there is a song to sit back to and reflect and think about it.<br />Like I said, the whole cd is a winner, but the following songs (In no certain order) just stick with me:<br />1)Going Under<br />2)Haunting<br />3)Tourniquet<br />4)Imaginary<br />5)Hello<br />If you are looking for deep, heartfelt but not sappy or mainstream poppy, then \\"Fallen\\" is it!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|what an incredible movie....<br />donnie's rapid descent into schizophrenia is a truly amazing and heartbreaking story... his trips over the edge of sanity are also amazing. so many of the scenes are unforgettable... his discussion in the movie theater with the demoic bunny frank, and the burning of the house... the look on donnie's face is just incredible, portrayed excellently by jake gyllenhaal.<BR>there seems to be an extra underlying theme to this movie beyond the ideas of time travel and schizophrenia... the whole fact that donnie is an average teenager from an average, normal family makes the film even more truly frightening. the confusing yet incredible ending will leave you wondering and wanting more.
B00011RPB0|1.0|What a terrible movie. The worst I have seen. The reviews on the pack use words like &quot;hilarious&quot; no way. This movie is ridiculous. Terrible plot terrible acting. The only thing that's funny about it is if you can stay awake. Like having your brain turned to sushi. Reviews on the package quote &quot;Two thumbs up!&quot; - Guess where their thumbs are? Don't waste your time or money.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Both my wife and i enjoyed the movie and teared up at the end.<br />We are both baby-boomers, we lived through those days. i remember my mom spoke seriously about the need for her to be home when us kids got there. But those days are gone, thankfully. For to relegate 1/2 the population to domestic servitude is to waste a significant part of their abilities, for taking care of a household and children is not a full time job in this country. period.<br />The movie is a clash of hopes. hopes about the future and a young bright womans part in it. Society ought not to put major roadblocks in their way(i am male) on the route to self realization. biology does the job intensely enough. and that is the movie. the clash of biology(the drive to reproduce and guard the offspring), the clash of cultural power whether a manipulative mother or a college's board of directors.<br />Julia Roberts is ok in the part, but you are always aware that it is J.R. playing a part, perhaps the problem of fame. the plot is well done, you find yourself cheering for the few who see a way out of their appointed-for-them destiny and you sympathize with their dilemma.<br />so it is a tear jerker, with a moral. not a bad way to spend an hour or two. something to talk about over coffee afterwards. go with a babyboomer, things have changed, maybe not always for the better, but the direction is right.
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in the recent past. I had a chance to watch DVD version of the movie recently and its never boring rather, I find it more thoughful.<br />No doubt - this is Kevin Spacey's best. Lot of venueus for exhibiting his acting skills. So many to point out - while at the fast food drive through meeting his wife with her boy friend, while clarifying the neighbor that he is not 'that', while talking to her daughter's friend after the game, and the best of all, while hearing that it is her first time. I don't see Kevin in the movie but Lester himself. He has lived the character. Class of acting! The Oscar he got was well acclaimed!<br />Interestingly most of the crew in the movie have excellently acted - be it her daughter or wife or the neighbor or neighbor's father.<br />There is enough fun in the movie - the dialogue commenting the two partners jogging with his neighbor is one best example. Cinematography - another wonder in the movie. The flying dirt bag shot by the boy is a beautiful poem of its own. Dialogues, Direction, Screenplay, Story - everything deservers appreciation - Flawless.<br />If at all critics complain about too much of reality or too much of abnormal characters in the movie - well! life is not normal always. Not everyone is perfect! And everyone with our own idiosyncrasies. But inside, the movie is very deep and requires varied serious thoughts.<br />And we cannot forget the silent serious and thoughtful emotion existing throughout the movie. The movie is never dirty or vulgar rather 'beautiful'.
B000065VA1|5.0|this is only a note regarding the musician credits found in the remastered version of &quot;so&quot;.  on the booklet's last page, each musician is listed in boldface type, followed by the instrument/vocal credit(s), followed (in parenthesis) by the track(s) that the musician appears on, according to track number.  but: the album has been resequenced and the listed track numbers in the credits refer to the original sequence.    since &quot;in your eyes&quot; has been moved from the middle of the album to the end (and i don't think that this interferes with the overall quality of the album's continuity), the credit numbers are now wrong, starting at track number 5.  so, the &quot;key&quot; would be (in the form of &quot;# listed in credits = actual numer on the remastered disc&quot;):   #5 = #9  ;  #6 = #5  ;  #7 = #6  ;  #8 = #7  ;  #9 = #8.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A beautiful romantic comedy but not in the normal sense.  It's hilarious at times and sad at times.  It's about two lonely people visiting Japan who develop a very special friendship and personally grow as people as a result of their friendship.  Bill Murray should win an Academy Award for his amazing understated, brilliant acting performance. He's also very funny at times. The movie's plot does not play it safe, like many other movies. This pays off.  This film is an incredible achievement for the director/writer. It's a deep, meaningful movie.
B00009V7PJ|3.0|This DVD is entertaining and worth watching.  Cher does look good and her voice is better than ever.  I'm tired of people comparing Madonna to Cher.  Madonna is a musical genius.  She had sold more albums than Cher and is the most successful female artist of all time. She also has the most number 1 songs of any female star.  Cher's songs have never reached number 1 with the exception of Believe.  Madonna has conquered the world.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This movie is very entertaining, even if you don't quite understand it. There are two storylines going on that are related to each other somehow and could leave a viewer confused at the end. However, the movie gets much better with repeat watches after you begin to understand it. There is a definite twist in this movie and I had to watch it two more times myself to fully understand what really happened. So if you don't get it the first time, watch it a few more times around and really pay attention before you judge this film.<br />I would also like to point out the beautiful setting the director and crew created with the darkness, water, and the creepy motel, and the mysterious atmosphere that was made that caused the characters to clash with one another. I wish the movie was a bit longer, though, because it felt like some of the characters weren't developed enough (hence the four stars). I really didn't care about some of the characters. But each personality was well done for each character and very distinct, some just needed more screentime.<br />Also, this movie was more like a mystery instead of a horror because I wasn't really scared. Instead, this movie really makes you think- about who the murderer is, who this mental patient is, and how he relates to all the murders. There are a few jumps, however, and enough suspense and action to keep viewers far from being bored. Also, the movie ends in a freaky way (that's where I was scared the most, however).<br />In conclusion, just go in with a very perceptive mind because you might miss a lot of things!
B00000811N|5.0|I've been all my life a fan of Pink Floyd and its members. The first time I listened to this album was an incredible experience, I really felt I was travelling through a body, and believe me, if the sperms are travelling like \\"more than seven dwarfs in penis land\\" what a wonderful life they must have.<BR>An excellent try for those who are Floydian fans, or Progressive rock fans. If you'd like to experiment alone a marvelous journey, TRY IT NOW.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo has absolutely brilliant, vibrant color! FN I must say is one of my all time favorite \\"cartoons\\" by far! I loved the story line and the ending made me so happy. This movie is funny while also letting you know how important family is and that hurtful words need not be, when it comes to love of family. Well worth the price and my time!
B00005JMCT|1.0|Stifler is one of my all time favorite characters and Seann Scott has more than delivered on this character that was little more than a minor character in t he first movie, and good for him. BUT, American Wedding was the least good of the three PIE films and I pray that there will NOT be a fourth. I was so disappointed in this film and how lacluster it was.  All the  movie executives at Universal who said this film was a &quot;go&quot; out there in Hollywood should lose their jobs. But not before paying back a lot of loyal fans whom they roped into seeing this piece of studio garbage. <BR>On the other side of the coin, Seann's latest DVD,Stark Raving Mad - is a great film and I want to see Seann in more films like that... no more stiflers or stifler clones (The Rundown, road trip etc etc)<br />Go do some more edgy indie stuff. SRM rocked. Fire the American Pie guys at universal and go back to the indie guys from SRM and keep making real movies.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Something that you might think after youve listened any album from Maiden, certainly is: How could I take so much time to listen the best band in the whole world? Iron Maiden is not just a Metal Band, They are more than you can imagine or realize. Think and stand which band in the whole story of music without any deserved support, like tv or pop radios, can keep and gain more and more legion of fans and sell millions of records? Of course Mr. Steve own much respect to Mr. Air Bruce Siren cause he is the man! But, if their songs or lyrics are not made from their hearts or love probably they had to stop playing a long time a go...<BR>Anyway, Iron Maiden is much more than a metal band, they are gods with religion, prays and songs to be sang. Nothing compared to any nu metal, just a real, loved, reasonable and honest music.<BR>If one day you have an opportunity to listen their songs, do it like they do...with honesty in your mind! Dont sell your soul to these sh#25t songs that they try to put in your mind playing in their sh#@$t radio and tvs...F@#k numetal and derivates!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I've seen this Austen adaptation three times, and it never fails to entertain.  Austen has captured the era in which she lived so well, this film treatment seldom hits a false note.<br /><br />I'm no Austen scholar, just a lover of costume dramas.  I enjoyed this one more than most, principally because of Amanda Root.  Let's face facts.  Emma Thompson in Sense and Sensability, and Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma are just gorgeous women.  Amanda Root is more plain, and as a consequence, more believable in the role.  Yes, you can forget Thompson and Paltrow in their roles, but the just aren't representative of what I imagine English women a couple of centuries ago.<br /><br />The acting is solid, the British accents understandable (some films out of Australia and Scotland, especially, really need subtitles!), and the sets fit what one would expect from that era.<br /><br />This is the definitive Persuasion, in my opinion.  There are great characters here, and very good acting, even from minor roles.  The film doesn't drag, and you really feel Anne Eliot's sense of loss and regret.<br /><br />Also stars the wonderful Susan Fleetwood and Corin Redgrave.  Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Captain Wentworth was also very good.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended!  This is a must-see!<br /><br />Update:  I've seen this film four or five times now, and it is as good on the fourth viewing as the first.  First-rate in all ways.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Save us from soul-less voices and mediocre pianists with the same boring tempo, limited vocal range and no originality in all her songs.  Get Laura Nyro's first 6  albumns instead, plus Gonna Take a Miracle, to hear the real thing instead of a weak imitation of a female piano-playing vocalist.  What a fuss over nothing!  Guess Ravi still has some real pull...
0783226837|4.0|Tremors is often described by many to be a cult classic, which is odd. The fact is, cult films usually have a quirky quality to them that separate them from the usual Hollywood-churned machine. Take Re-Animator, for example, or even the recent Ravenous, both of which have oddities and bloody quirks that average viewers might find repellant. But Tremors isn't the slightest bit offbeat. It's made in full Hollywood-style with a predictably happy ending to boot. So what makes it a \\"cult classic\\"? Could it be that it's successful in mixing almost every genre into the proceedings or that it's great entertainment that simply didn't get the box office reception it deserved? Perhaps both, because this is one movie that always puts a smile on my face and simultaneously gets my pulse-pounding every time I watch it.<br />The plot is similar to that of the monster films of the old days. Valentine Mckee (Kevin Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are two handymen \\"trapped\\" in the small town of Perfection, Nevada. They have dreams of making it big, but their ambitious goals always seem out of reach. Just when they do decide to finally leave, the discovery of dead bodies, both human and animal, keep them there for just a while longer. There's also the road, which has been blocked by a large boulder.<br />On hand to study some strange seismic activity is Rhonda (Finn Carter), a grad student who helps Mckee and Bassett come to the realization that both the deaths and the odd vibrations in the ground are connected. It turns out to be the work of giant 30-foot worms, four of them to be exact, and they trap the townspeople of Perfection in their homes, including gun-happy, WWIII-prepared couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire). The rest of the film becomes a desperate scramble to outsmart the worms and get out of the town alive.<br />The first thing that's noticable about Tremors is probably how it's obviously inspired by 50's monster flicks. The great thing, though, is that Tremors plays itself as a comedy, preferring laughs over scares, a wise decision since if the film took itself seriously, it would have been a major detriment. The laughs aren't cheap, either, as they result from witty dialogue and new twists on the \\"monster\\" subgenre. The great chemistry between Bacon and Ward brings the most humor to the film. Playing best friends with little education but plenty of smarts, these are two performances that are a hoot to watch. It'd be great to see them in another film together again (too bad it didn't happen in Tremors 2).<br />But in addition to the laughs, there's also the action, which is frenetic and exciting. Director Ron Underwood gives the film a lightning pace and the 95 minutes seems to just roll by. The fun action consists of a lot of running and \\"get off the ground\\" moments. For the last 45 minutes, Tremors is almost full of non-stop excitement, and it's surprising to see that the action never gets tiresome nor dull for a single moment. The movie isn't scary or frightening at all, but with suspense and thrills this sharp, who cares (Besides, being scary is hardly the film's intent.)?<br />It's nice to see that this movie is not particularly gory or full of gratuitous violence. While I do enjoy gory violence when it fits the style and tone, it wouldn't have been welcome here and the light-hearted feel that permeates Tremors is a crucial reason to its success; there's no unneccessary unpleasantness and it also proves that the movie creates genuine excitement without resorting to splashing blood all over the screen. Because of this, it easily reaches out to a larger amount of viewers, making it a movie that's just as easily accessible for fans of, say, screwball comeides as it is for action lovers. Since the movie is PG-13, there are still a couple of moments of semi-graphic violence, but nothing objectionable to someone 10 years or older.<br />The special effects are fun, with the worms as the film's showpiece. Thankfully, there's no overdone CGI and the worms are actually well-rendered and convincing. But I must say, I was a little misled, seeing how it is the worms don't actually look like the one on the video box cover (which actually looks cooler). But never mind that, I'm wondering how the director managed to pull off so many scenes of the creatures popping out from underground. I mean, given the fact that this is a goofy monster movie, it couldn't have been given a very big budget. I also love those worm POV shots, particularly the ones that actually feature the camera wading through the dirt.<br />S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock's script is clever without being particulary intelligent or distinguished. This isn't a brilliant film by a long shot but it goes to show that some writers who just want to write a fun script can actually get the job done. It's a little odd to note that all of Wilson and Maddock's other screenplays (with maybe the exception of Tremors' own sequels) have been pretty bad, culminating to the debacle known as Wild Wild West. Unlike that film and the others they've written, this one isn't soulless.<br />But it's not the action and the laughs that put this film above so many countless movies of the genre. It is, after all, the characters that make this film as highly entertaining as it is. As said before, Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward's chemistry is natural and they deliver some of their best acting in their careers. It's actually a shame that Ward never reached the same heights of stardom as Bacon; he sure as hell had the charisma and acting skill for it. Also very good is Finn Carter as Rhonda, and it's also a little unfortunate her career hasn't gone far since this. She and Bacon also have some nice chemistry, which further establishes this movie as one that also works partially as a romance (a good feat, considering it's not even striving to be one). The other standouts are Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire as the gun-toting couple. Their performances are a lot of fun and there's a hilarious scene involving the two of them trying to kill one of the giant worms in their basement.<br />Tremors wasn't much of a box office success but has since gone on to have a strong life on video, to the point where it even inspired other knowingly goofy creature features such as Anaconda, Lake Placid, Deep Blue Sea, and Deep Rising (of these three, only Rising comes to mind as a must see). The film's also got its own sequels, the first of which I remember as being pretty fun but certainly inferior.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B0001BKAEY|5.0|All I can say is that people who love the trilogy are people with an open mind. The first film wasnt even for all audiences to like, but since the action was amazing they liked it for that and not the story or concept and the work put into the film.<br />i love revolutions for what it is and how it let me answer the questions from reloaded by myself.

B000096FUD|3.0|&quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; chronicles the attempts of Director Terry Gilliam (\\"Brazil,\\" Monty Python series and movies) to bring the story of Don Quixote to the screen. The movie, entitled \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,\\" could have been a spectacular adaptation of what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.  Other directors have struggled to adapt this difficult novel to the screen and hammer out a workable script; however, Gilliam seemed to have solved that problem by adding a new character from the present (played by Johnny Depp), who travels back in time and meets Don Quixote.  Sounds like more fantastic mind-bending Gilliam fare, doesn't it?<br />This documentary was obviously intended as a behind-the-scenes short to be included on the DVD release.  However, \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\\" was plagued with a series of mishaps and bad luck, including a sick leading actor (Jean Rocheport) and a storm (caught magnificently on tape) that destroyed the set and equipment.  The movie ended up being abandoned, but we do get to see a few tantalizing minutes of film - and it looks like it could have been extraordinary.  Although the film seems to have been cursed, many movies every year are announced but never get finished.  Thus, &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; shows the lay public what actually happens when film-making goes awry.<br />The directors (Keith Fulton &amp; Louis Pepe) know their topic well, as they've worked with Gilliam before; they made the behind-the-scenes documentary that appears on the DVD for &quot;Twelve Monkeys.&quot;  As such, they had a great deal of access to Gilliam, and he seems very comfortable discussing the catastrophes.  The narration by Jeff Bridges is fair but a bit too sparse.  Ultimately, the documentary is interesting but somewhat insubstantial and no-frills, which does impinge somewhat on the overall enjoyment of the movie.  Make sure, though, that you watch it all the way through the end credits - the \\"coming soon\\" gag is hilarious.on\\" gag is hilarious.

0385510438|5.0|John Grisham's new novel, &quot;The Last Juror,&quot; is set in Clanton, Mississippi in the 1970's. Joyner William Traynor is a twenty-three-year-old college dropout with a background in journalism. His wealthy grandmother lends Traynor the money to buy &quot;The Ford County Times,&quot; a bankrupt weekly newspaper.  The young man, dubbed &quot;Willie&quot; by the folks in Clanton, is determined to turn the newspaper into a profitable enterprise.<br />When a young widow named Rhoda Kassellaw is raped and murdered in Clanton, Willie reports the crime and the subsequent trial in lurid detail.  &quot;The Ford County Times&quot; gains a host of new readers and Willie becomes a fixture in Clanton.  He also makes himself the target of some dangerous people.  Danny Padgitt is accused of the Kassellaw murder, and his family is well known for bribing public officials and killing people who cross them.  The Padgitts are not at all happy with Willie Traynor's coverage of the Kassellaw murder.  Danny even has the temerity to tell the jurors that if they convict him, he will get them sooner or later.<br />With &quot;The Last Juror,&quot; Grisham is in top form.  He beautifully depicts the assorted characters in Clanton, including the corrupt politicians, the drunken reporters, the gun-toting citizenry, and the good Christians who have a personal relationship with the Lord.  One of most memorable characters is Miss Callie Ruffin, a black woman who has raised eight children, seven of whom went on to earn PhD's.  Willie writes a lengthy and complimentary feature in his newspaper on Miss Callie and her family.  He also becomes Callie's dear friend and a frequent guest at her bountiful table.  Miss Callie is the first black woman voter as well as the first black juror in Clanton, having been picked to serve on the Padgitt jury.<br />&quot;The Last Juror&quot; has suspense, excitement, warmth, and gentle humor.  Without preaching, Grisham perfectly captures the racial tension and the social upheaval of rural Mississippi in the seventies.  He tells his story through Willie Traynor with effortless simplicity and with great affection.  &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is a pleasure to read, and it is one of Grisham's finest novels.social upheaval of rural Mississippi in the seventies.

0790734850|5.0|I wanted to watch this movie right from the moment of its release more than six years ago, but for one reason or other I never got around to do it...until now. Luckily I did not continue procrastinating, because this is probably one of the best movies in the film noir category.<br />The story, based on the novel by James Ellroy, starts with Danny De Vito's narration of the latest events in the city of angels, which include the arrest of Mickey C, head of the organized crime. I have always enjoyed listening to De Vito narrate a story, and as happened in &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, I was enthralled from the beginning. De Vito plays a journalist working for a tabloid called Hush-hush, who has several contacts inside the police department that give him exclusives in exchange for publicity. One of these is Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a classic &quot;ladies man&quot;, interested in fame and in the Hollywood world much more than he is interested in police business. Vincennes works in the same precinct with Sergeant, soon to be Detective Lieutenant, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and with Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe). Exley is the typical &quot;go by the book&quot; guy, son of a famous officer murdered years ago in a crime that was never solved. White is a cop whose main interest is helping ladies in distress, playing a typical knight in a shinning armor. After a situation at the police station ends up in disaster, the relationship among the three policemen is turned into a confrontational one when White's partner is forced to quit his job.<br />Shortly after those events a multiple murder in the Night Owl will have the three policemen desperately trying to solve the same crime and facing a well-oiled criminal organization. At this point the plot and relationship between the characters acquire an amazing depth and keeps the audience guessing right until the end. The performances of Spacey, Pearce and Russell are laudable, and the appearance of Kim Basinger, as a high-class prostitute, adds the missing element to complete an extraordinary cast. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you do it as soon as possible.a high-class prostitute, adds the missing element to complete an extraordinary cast.

B00006EXCC|4.0|At last, the 14 song UK version of The Rolling Stones Aftermath.  This is one of my favorite Rolling Stones albums. It was a landmark album for the band as it was the first Rolling Stones album to consist of all original Jagger/Richards material. The days of doing cover versions of other artist's songs were slowing down as the band was beginning to develop their own style and sound. With original hits over the last 15 months such as \\"Heart Of Stone,\\" \\"The Last Time,\\" \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" and \\"Get Off Of My Cloud,\\" Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were developing into a very strong songwriting team. Besides Mick and Keith coming into their own as songwriters, Brian Jones was beginning to show his versatility as a musician as he played several differernt instruments: Indian Sitar on &quot;Mothers Little Helper,&quot; marimbas (African xylophone) on &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; &quot;Out Of Time,&quot; and mountain dulcimer on &quot;Lady Jane,&quot; &quot;I Am Waiting,&quot; as well as harmonica &quot;High And Dry,&quot; &quot;Goin' Home,&quot; and guitar and keyboards. The album also contains the 11-minute blues jam &quot;Goin' Home&quot;.  The album was immediately praised as one of their best albums and has remained a fan favorite from the Brian Jones era.  The album has some great pop tunes on it.  Don't just judge the Rolling Stones by their radio hits, some of their studio albums have a lot of hidden gems, and this album is one of them.  The sound has been greatly improved for SACD as part of ABKCO Records &quot;Rolling Stones Remastered Series&quot;.  I highly recommend this album.  <br />HISTORICAL REFERENCE<BR>The album peaked at #1 in the UK. The Aftermath sessions also produced the hit singles \\"19th Nervous Breakdown,\\" and \\"Paint It Black\\" in the UK.  Many songs on this album were also covered by other British artists at the time like The Zombies, Chris Farlowe, The Searchers, and others.  The 11-minute &quot;Goin' Home&quot; is what inspired The Doors to make their song &quot;The End&quot; over 11-minutes long.  The album was recorded entirely at RCA Studios in Hollywood, the same studio where Elvis Presley had once recorded, during two separate sessions, one in December 1965 and the other in March 1966. It was also the first Rolling Stones album recorded entirely in the United States, and it was also the first album released in Stereo.
0793518326|5.0|I have read some of the negative feedback for this book, and I am pretty disgusted. This is the best book I have EVER SEEN. <br />It has identified 95% of the instruments on every Beatle song. People say that they have seen better stuff off the internet. They must be CRAZY!!! I have been getting crap off the internet for years. Most songs are incomplete. They say they will &quot;tab the rest later&quot;. Yeah right! and some are even in the wrong key.<br />Yes, I will admit that there are typos, but you like the Beatles enough to buy this book, then you will know if its a G minor instead of a G major and that type of stuff. <br />People also complain about the typos in the lyrics. If you know the Beatles enough to purchase this book, then you know the lyrics anyway!!<br />People also complain how &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot; isn't in there. Well Hello!!!! This book wasn't even published until 1993, while the two songs mentioned came out in '95/'96. <br />Bottom line, this is the best you'll ever get. Yeah, the type is small, but it's not invisible. I have a blast dusting off any album and playing along, because it's all there.
B00018D44U|1.0|what a disapointment so much from&quot;come away with me&quot;to absolute boring drivel. this cd as far as i am concerned does not get even one star rating
B000002OX7|5.0|People who give this perfect record any less than 5 stars are foolish and have no taste.  And you don't have to be a geezer to like the Who...I am 34, is that geezerish?  This album is beautiful- get it.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Who wants to go to the Royal Albert Hall with me in June! If you are a true Jeff Beck fan then you'll hardly be able to contain yourself when you hear this music. God is playing through Jeff - no doubt about it.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I really enjoyed &quot;Is This It&quot; after I got over my annoyance at the ridiculous amount of slobbering praise heaped upon it. But The Strokes' followup does make me wonder whether they only ever had one good idea to work with. Oh sure, it's a fun album with some insanely catchy songs on it, but none offers something new or matches the standouts from their debut like &quot;Last Nite&quot; or &quot;Modern Age&quot;. It doesn't help also that Julian Casablancas and his bandmates still appear to have no discernible personality behind their cool clothes; there's no spark to either Julian's droning singing or the vague lyrics that say... well nothing whatsoever. Overall, a decent but underwhelming album.
B0000C8AQM|2.0|Track listing only bears a remote resemblance to the movie.  Many tracks are missing, or substituted for alternative tracks from the same artist, the question then remains, why bother...  Can it even be called a movie sountrack?<br />What happened to Black Shuck by The Darkness, it got replaced by the more radio friendly &quot;Growing on Me&quot;...<br />Where did Bowie's awesome Moonage Daydream dissapear to?  Who knows....<br />Avoid, it's a cheap corporate cash-in.  Spend your money on some classic rock albums from Purple, Sabbath, AC-DC instead...<br />Great movie, rubbish soundtrack....
B00003CXWV|4.0|Johnny has done it again. I admit it, I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, I think I've seen all his movies, anyways, Blow is a very sad movie, not sad as in pathetic but sad as in emotionally sad, The character Johnny plays George Jung, small town boy, moves to California, stars dealing Marijuana and ends with Cocaine, I'm not one to sympathize for the lives of dealers but this movie just got to me, I guess it's because of the reason he did his last score, people who have watched the movie should know what I am talking about, for those have not seen the movies, do watch it. It is flawed but as always Johnny somehow makes me forget everything wrong with the film and just concentrate on him and his life. A very good movie, not something to watch with your 12 year old kids but good nonetheless.
B00000I41J|5.0|This album is one of the all-time jazz classics and makes it onto just about every &quot;best jazz albums&quot; list. Miles Davis plays on Adderly's album and his influence shows. Very, very nice to listen to. By the way, Adderly played on the legendary &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; album, the best selling jazz album ever.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White Album is the Beatles' Magnum Opus, a legendary work that tackles every music style and emotion in existence at the time of conception. After closer scrutiny it becomes evident that the band was starting to fall apart. The album sounds like it was pieced together form solo efforts. Of course, solo Beatles would never sound this good, it was obvious that especially Lennon and McCartney needed each other to make that divine music. A wide variety of genres is present here, from the Beach Boys rock'n'roll on the opening track, to the reggae of Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da, to the Baroque sounding Piggies, to the country/western of Rocky Raccoon and Don't Pass My By, to blues on Yer Blues, to hard rock on Helter Skelter, '20s Vaudeville on Honey Pie, finally to some sort of Disney-inspired track lullaby, Good Night. Lennon and McCartney decided to write songs in each other's styles for this album. John produced the beautiful and haunting Julia, an ode to his mother who abandoned him and was later killed in a car crash when he was 14, just when he was beginning to get to know her. Paul wrote Helter Skelter, which even now would be consider a very hard-rockin' song, and it's a wonder he can still sing after screaming like that! Ringo makes his first songwriting effort on Don't Pass Me By, and it's quite cute. He reappears as lead vocalist on Why Don't We Do It In the Road and Good Night. George also has a few songs, namely Piggies, Long Long Long, Savoy Truffle, and most notably, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, guest starring Eric Clapton. Then there are countless other gems, like the dreamy Dear Prudence, which has some lovely chord progressions, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Blackbird, I Will, Sexy Sadie, and lots more. There are a few disappointments on the album, like Revolution 9, which just consists of some random noise from radios and tape loops, and Long Long Long and Wild Honey Pie. These faults don't measure up to the good points, and that's why it gets 5 stars. There, Ihope you're well informed now.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I eagerly awaited this release and was not disappointed one bit.  Sarah's beautiful voice is wonderful, as usual.  The CD is one that I easily played from song 1 to the end from the first day in my CD player without the urge to give it a rest because the songs are all so enchanting.  I know it got some bad reviews about how it's &quot;no Fumbling&quot;, but this is a different Sarah- she's older and now a mother.  I can't help but see the changes in her writing style that may reflect this.  Nevertheless, it's *still Sarah and it's very much worth the listen (and listen... and listen... and listen).
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I should never have brought this record. I simply can't stand her voice. The only song I like was ''Breathe On Me''.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|I have to admit that I bought this cd the first day it was in stores. My first impression was that it's not as good overall as 2001's MISUNDAZTOOD, but I still think that P!nk rocks (though I wish she would quit smoking!). The only tracks I really don't care for are 'The Last to Know' and the bonus track 'Hooker.' 'Hooker' is just plain stupid and contains WAY too much profanity. But tracks like 'Trouble' 'Tonight's the Night' 'Walk Away' 'Save My Life' 'Catch me while I'm Sleeping' 'Humble Neighbourhood' and the dazzling 'God is a DJ' are simply awesome. Why radio has turned it's back on P!nk I'll never figure out. Tim Armstrong of Rancid, by the way, is a fantastic producer. Rock on Alecia!
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is my favorite CD ever! Every song is different and I just love the lead singer's voice! Every song is so funky and I could swear to that on every song ( except number three, which i dislike) i could say I have atleast ten favorite parts. My favorite song is She Will Be Loved- it reminds me of  walking alone in New York City with an umbrella and splashing puddles. Adam's voice is really great, and another favorite song is Must Get Out- Reminds me of parking in a car and making out. I love all of the songs and I recommend this cd to all of my friends and everyone!
B00008S2VG|5.0|When I first bought this, I'll be honest (I was very disappointed with it)...But then I took my time to listen to it and to the lyrics, which describe cruel reality. Believe me, The album isn't that bad as many reviewers describe it. It's undeniably one of Madonna's nastiest albums (Yes)..., but like I said, Life is cruel and nasty, it's not use being pretentious and ignoring the fact.<br />My Favorites Are-<br />In the title track ''American Life'' Madonna protests against the American Government. Really no other track of Madonna's that involves politics, this song has the same contemplation in mind that Stings ''This War'' has.<br />''Hollywood''. This is possibly one of Madonna's best nightspot tunes along with ''Vogue'' & ''Music''. The track is a light reminiscent of 1992's ''Erotica'' coolly combined with 2002's/2003's ''Die Another Day'' the ending for this song is pretty hot, it's really unusual but yet cool.<br />''Nobody Knows Me''. A lush of semi-pulse beats, with Madonna's remarkably convincing lyrics & vocals that more or less state ''No one's telling you how to live your life, But It's a setup until you're fed Up'', The concept of this song has definitely got something to do with being Anti-Social, if you pay attention to the lyrics.<br />''Nothing Fails''. This track summons thickset down-tempo beats, and then you have Madonna's voice (possibly at its best) from this album. This song is allot similar to ''Don't Tell Me'' in measures.<br />''Love Profusion''. This a ballad, featuring some light techno bass beats, the track is probably the nearest you can get to 1998's ''Ray Of Light''. In Feb 2004, Love Profusion (when remixed by Ralphi Rosario) became a dance floor hit, Which (rarely) lasted for about 2 weeks peaking the average N'7 in the top 10 Dance Radio Charts.<br />''Mother And Father''. I think Technically speaking, lyrically, vocally and musically this song is probably the best from this album. It's a very personal track for Madonna, the kindof personal track ''Mer Girl'' was.<br /> <br />It's unfortunate that this album failed to be a success, Although?....It might have failed success Commercially, but Popularly and Widely it was very successful especially because of what happened at the ''VMA MTV Awards 2003'' and the (original) shocking controversial video of the title track ''American Life''. The other tracks, are ok, nothing really special but remarkable.<br />Hopefully Madonna's next album will be allot more inspired and successful commercially.
B000069AUI|5.0|Truly, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. And mind you, I own almost the whole Beatles catalogue. I've also been a fan for almost three years, that is long before Clocks was released. And yeah, I've heard the Radiohead arguments. Coldplay don't sound anything like them. Honestly, it IS possible to be a fan of both. Chris Martin uses the falsetto, just like Thom Yorke, but to a very different effect. Chris' voice has a sweetness, tenderness and optimism that isn't present in Thom's. It is not better or worse, just different. The same can be said of Coldplay's music. It is actually much closer to U2 and the Beatles. When I listen to the sound of the guitars and the tempi I can hear U2. The chord progression, however, is very similar to that of the Beatles, with it's switches from major to minor, sharp to flat. This is most evident in the songs God Put a Smile On Your Face, Daylight and A Rush of Blood to the Head. Especially Daylight has an eastern melody that sounds like it could have come straight out of Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour. There is also something else: behind all the melancholy lies an unmistakeable optimism and hope, which is often also present in many later Beatles songs, especially those on Abbey Road. This is a beautiful, delicate, tasteful and extremely well-crafted album. Highly recommended.
B000002BBY|5.0|I dont care what anyone says, oasis are better than the Beatles. The have produces, in my mind, 4 outsatanding albums. Morning Glory, The Masterplan, Definately Maybe and Heathen Chemistry. To call this second best to The Masterplan is a huge comliment. Masterplan is, and always will be my favourite, but this is equally awsome.<br />But, this is a review on Morning Glory, and 5 stars simply isnt enough.
B0000027I6|4.0|I admit I was a bit skeptical about this cd, but now that I've listened to it, I like it.  Roger Waters really is a genius and this cd picks up a little bit of that Pink Floyd sound that everybody loves.  I think the highlight of this cd is &quot;What God Wants&quot;  That song rocks.  This just goes to show that you can take Roger Waters out of Pink Floyd, but you can't take Pink Floyd out of Roger Waters!
B00000JRTX|3.0|ok.  i loved the british characters.  they were funny, touching, and altogether sympathetic.  i would have preferred kristin scott thomas's character as the heroine, but oh well.  i loved their sense of humor, and at the same time, i felt their sadness poignantly, particularly when john hannah gives his elegy.  i think i actually teared up a bit.  there were many of these precious moments.<br />but leave the damaging factor to the american heroine.  i'm an american, but i just could not and would not identify with andie mcdowell's character.  she kept trying to give that mysterious elusive quality to the character and just utterly failed.  rather than seeming elusive and aloof, she seemed more like a tease that just wasn't worth it.<br />don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies, but that also means that i like my romantic comedies to be perfectly executed.  the casting diretor failed miserably when casting andie mcdowell.  either that or the screenwriter just didn't want to be nice to his heroine.  but then, i really think andie's character could have been much more sympathetic if a different actress had played it - maybe even julia roberts, even when i'm not exactly a fan.  i mean, how could a casting director think that viewers would find andie's character more desirable than that of kristin scott thomas (i forget the characters' names).  i was honestly smacking myself in the forehead crying, why, charles why?<br />i understand a lot of people did like this movie, and i admit that this movie had so many great moments.  but i stand by my humble opinion that andie mcdowell, simply put, sucked.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|On Jan 26th 1961 I walked into a nondescript dancehall on the outskirts of Liverpool looking for a new band to feature in my clubs in the City Centre.  I'd come to see The Beatles for the first time. Completely bowled over by their music and charisma I immediately gave them 12 bookings.  That first night I told Paul and John that one day `they'd be as big as Elvis'.<br />I got that same feeling of excitement when I first saw Joe Bonamassa and his Band in De Kalb Illinois last Summer.<BR>Now I have all his albums and the DVD and state categorically.<BR>Joe is the premier Blues/Rock artiste on the Planet.<BR>And within two years everyone's going to know it.<br />Sam Leach.

B000089RVX|5.0|Oh my god, where can I even start!  I just remember the first night I began listening to the album:  It was late, I was the only one up, and I decided to give the songs a whirl.  At first, I listened to Bring Me To Life, which I was already in love with, and then heard Going Under.  To say that I was blown away is to put it ever so lightly.  Next came My Immortal, then Hello, and on and on.  What I simply could not believe was that I could not find a single song I didn't like, something I've never encountered with any other album I've ever bought.  Secondly, I could not get over how each and every song made me feel inside; the gentle, artistic blend of classical orchestra and chorus mixed with the pounding rush of metal and Amy Lee's etheral voice.  I've never heard a sound, a FEEL put together so wonderfully in any of the music I've ever listened to before.  Needless to say, the music of Evanescense is pretty all I listen to now.  The stuff on the radio has become senseless noise, and to this day, I have not grown tired of it, and I don't think I ever will.  I anxiously await any new music Evanescense will give to us.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I would have to say that I wished Revolutions had as much or more of the awesome 'in the Matrix' action of the first two movies, but I gotta say that you can't judge these movies individually, you have to look at them as one. The first one was obviously the more mind-blowing since it was so new, the second was filler, and the third would be the end of the story AS TOLD by the Wachowski brothers. If you're not a Matrix fan, then just relax and go back to X-Men or something. These movies, and the video game, require you to think about the whole story. I'm going to buy Revolutions when it comes out to complete my set. I know that sounds tright, but hey, works of art like this don't come along very often...
6303921248|5.0|I did things a little backward seeing this video series first, and then going on to read Jane Austen's book.  But that's how much I loved it!  When it was over I wanted more details on Elizabeth and Darcy and the book filled in those details.  The video series is very true to the book and I found much of the dialogue is taken right from the pages of Jane Austen's novel.    I thought that Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth were wonderful as  Lizzie and Darcy. It's amazing to watch Colin Firth do some incredible acting without ever opening his mouth!  He did a fabulous job acting a role that must have been incredibly difficult since he said so little yet expressed so much!  This is truly my favorite film of all time.  If you like it half as much as I did, you'll love it!

0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is a simply told yet powerful story of how we can transform our lives just by following our dreams as far as they can take us.  This book reminded me of several other simple yet powerful books that I have read - Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, Le Petite Prince by Antoine De Saint Exupery &amp; Candide by Voltaire.  An author doesn't have to use complicated, &quot;grown-up&quot; language to tell a good story.  This book lived up to the hype it has gotten for the past 10+ years.
0205313426|5.0|This was my very first writing `how-to' book. My initial copy has long since bit the dust, and the one I have now has seen better days. So obviously, although it was my first, it still gets a lot of use. It's a slim book of only eighty-four pages, but it's packed with basic elements of writing that every writer should know, including: grammar, word usage and sentence structure. There's nothing new here, but I'm willing to bet you've forgotten half of what's in it. I still use it regularly - every time I need to remember the proper usage of lay and lie, or further and farther.
B00000HZH7|1.0|Maybe I would have liked these guys if I had heard them when they first arrived on the metal scene, but hearing them now...WOW these guys were bad! I will give them credit, they were one of starters of the Death/Black Metal movement but that doesn't necessarily make them good. Even with the CD remastered it sounds terrible. The original production was just horendous. Plus the lyrics and guitar playing is terrible! Not to mention the vocals. Even for Death Metal vocals these are bad. I see these guys made a second album, but after hearing this monstrosity I think I will pass on it. There is MUCH better metal out there.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The only thing that bothers me about this DVD is that it does not have a full screen version. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, this special edition DVD is very good. Terminator 3 has a full screen version, and I believe that Terminator 2 now has one. I'm hoping that a full screen DVD is in the works for the original, since not everybody likes widescreen and the two sequels seem to have this feature.
0385510438|2.0|The main theme of Grisham model of the dialectic paradigm of narrative is not theory, but subtheory. However, the stasis, and hence the collapse, of postcapitalist narrative which is a central theme of The Pelican Brief emerges again in The Last Juror, although in a more self-sufficient sense.<BR>The characteristic theme of the works of Grisham is not discourse, as Derrida would have it, but postdiscourse. If the dialectic paradigm of narrative holds, we have to choose between neodialectic rationalism and deconstructivist capitalism. Therefore, the dialectic paradigm of narrative holds that consciousness serves to marginalize the underprivileged.<BR> Marx promotes the use of neodialectic rationalism to modify sexuality. However, the primary theme of Long's analysis of the dialectic paradigm of narrative is not desituationism, but predesituationism.<br />The premise of neodialectic rationalism holds that the State is part of the fatal flaw of consciousness, given that art is interchangeable with consciousness. But any number of narratives concerning realism exist. <br />\\"Art is intrinsically impossible,\\" says Derrida. The destruction/creation distinction prevalent in Joyce's Finnegan's Wake is also evident in The Last Juror. In a sense, Baudrillard's model of the textual paradigm of reality suggests that reality is part of the defining characteristic of narrativity.
0684853523|5.0|Okay, I admit it. I'm a Stephen King fan. I've been reading his books since the early eighties and think he's one of the best story-tellers of our time. So, when I heard he wrote a book on writing, I was on the Amazon waiting list way before the book came out. And I wasn't disappointed.<br />The first part of the book is about the man himself. Now you may ask, what does this have to do with writing? Everything. Writing is a difficult way to make a living and a solitary and uncertain way of life. Reading about Mr. King's life is an inspiration. Plus, it's great to discover that someone at his level is still a writer at heart and suffers from all the same maladies as the rest of us.<br />The second part of the book is his thoughts on writing and the writing process. It's simple, straightforward and informative. There are no great truths or revelations here, but some very basic and important guidelines. Every author I've talked to about this book has found at least one piece of information in this section that made the book worthwhile.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing or the writing life.
0385504209|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is a BRAINWASHING BOOK, BEWARE!!!! This author has a large lack of christian history and knowledge, as well as not having a hint of how is the Louvre Museum and the city of Paris. The author at least should have taken a tourist map of Paris to help his writing but this is not the case since he has created his own imaginary Paris and a godless novell. But of course, there is nothing much to spect from a fictional book that talks about controversial themes which makes it a bestseller. The author could have done a great work, but he missed the opportunity.

B00018D44U|5.0|I bought Come Away With Me much after the Grammy rush and was pleased to find that all of the excitement around this cd was right.  I always check out the new CD's section when I'm shopping and found Norah's new release, Feels Like Home yesterday - hadn't read a review - but just couldn't get enough of Norah's music and was ready for more!  I'm absolutely amazed that this, her sophomore effort, is as excellent as her first CD.  Norah's music soothes the soul and I plan on being a fan for as long as she's around to create her beautiful music.

B00003CWL6|5.0|It's interesting to read the opinion of others about this film.<br />I perceive the movie as a fabulous multi-faceted work of art. Since I purchased the DVD, each time I observe something new, different and exciting. I believe it accurately depicts the &quot;human tragedy&quot; that we do not or will not accept as a part of our lives.<br />I highly recommend the film because [American] &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've watched Coldplay's rise to the top of the charts, and always felt excited since I liked them before they were the mega-stars they are now.  I bought &quot;Parachutes&quot; on a whim, without ever hearing of the band, and instantly fell in love.  I was a little concerned that their new-found fame might result in a sub-par album, but instead, &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head' is even more innovative.<br />Christ Martin combines an juxaposes rock chords with soothing music, hopeful lyrics with melancholy pain, and upbeat with slow.  The diversity of Coldplay is what makes the band so incredibly special and unique.  On songs like &quot;In Your Place,&quot; the combination of the music and soulful lyrics reminds me of the music masters of yesteryear, while songs like &quot;Clocks&quot; sounds unlike anything else on the market today.<br />&quot;rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a wondeful CD--not just for those on the cutting edge of music, but really, for all generations. Its the type of CD that you can play in the car regardless of the age, gender, or musical taste of the riders, and chances are they will be pleased.  <br />Coldplay mananges to be one of the most creative and fresh band on the music scene today, while also satisying the mainstream audience--without selling out.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Wow was this.. empty. It seemed like a lot of the movie had been cut because the transitions from one plot aspect to the next seemed choppy- too abrupt. One minute Electra wouldn't give Matt her name, the next minute they were kissing, the next minute they were doing the sex. This movie was just so vapid- especially compared to Spiderman which took pains to develop the characters and bring out their humanity, building an action movie that was also emotional. Daredevil was just missing something essential and epitomized Hollywood blockbuster film at its worst. The only thing I can say is the bat-style sonar effects were well done. Oh, and of course the Stan Lee cameo always tickles me.
078322947X|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and was blown away.  It was pulse-pounding, sweaty, hot, real, and disturbing.  Roy Scheider's portrayal of a man with nothing and everything left to lose rang true.  The French second lead and the other actors became real men caught in a black hole of fate and error and karma and circumstance.  <br />I am a combat veteran of the War in Vietnam and I have a personal register I trust deeply when it comes to depictions of men under mortal stress.  This movie worked on every level.<br />The violence was abrupt and appalling; the indifference of desperate men to the fate of others was accurate and frightening.  <br />I rented the original on VHS and felt at the time and still feel that Friedkin's film is a masterwork of its kind. I have seen each film twice.  Sorcerer is the jewel.  The original seems ham-handed and sentimental by comparison.<br />Terror is not an existential experience; it is personal and intimate and painful and surreal.<br />Sorcerer teaches us to be mindful; a single error of judgement or choice by any one of us can lead us into a deep inexorable hell.
B00005NTJK|5.0|This is a terrific album. The quality that I find so striking about this album is how it is both uncommercial and full of catchy tunes.  My favorite is &quot;for Michael Collins, Jeffrey and me&quot; with its incredible hook chorus &quot;I'm with you LEM, thought it's a shame it had to be you.&quot; (LEM stands for &quot;Lunar Entry Module, the astronaut on the first landing on the moon Appolo mission who didn't get to walk on the moon.)  Inside, Son and Teacher are also solid efforts.  Some fans may quibble, but I think Clive Bunker and Glenn Conrick are Tull's best rhythm section, except perhaps for Barrymore Barlow and John Glascock.  Benefit turns up all aces.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Brian,<br />As a father of a teenage daughter I have watched the Gilmore Girls to ensure that the content is age appropriate. This is pure \\"chick flick\\" material not at all for macho guys like you or me. The dialogue, the story and the character development are targeted at girls. The 5 stars is from my daughter who loves the show. The mother would drive anyone insane, she acts like a sister and is so far removed from the personality of a real parent that the show is unwatchable,at least for this male.
B00005R87K|5.0|NOSFERATU is my all-time favorite vampire movie. Released in 1922, it is more frightening, and creates a far better sense / atmosphere of dread than any other bloodsucker film I've seen. Max Schreck is perfect as the mysterious count. His spider-like actions accentuate his oddly sculpted, rodent-like features. He is Dracula in a way that no one else (including Lugosi) has ever managed to equal, let alone, surpass. He is actually scary! Watch him terrify young Harker. Watch the crew of the Demeter meet their doom. Watch the count's long-distance hypnotic effect on Nina. This is vampirism as more than just a gore-fest or spooky halloween story. This is the tale of a believable vampire in the guise of a man. I cannot recommend NOSFERATU highly enough. Just buy it...
B0001HLVSC|5.0|In addition to the treat of seeing Russell Crowe in any role, this movie's story of valiant fighting men in an earlier era was done superbly by Weir.  One felt as if transported to the early 19th century, and marveled at the conditions our forebearers endured with such gusto.  It's a rousing tale told by a \\"master\\" story-teller (Patrick O'Brian), whose books are fascinating.  Anyone who loves adventure, the sea, historical tales and Russell Crowe will love this one.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This is the first outing by artist/producer Kanye West. Is it good? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes.<br />Like many others, I eagerly anticipated this CD. Did it disappoint? Yes, and no. It has some great moments, but a few things bring down it's value from being a classic.<br />College Dropout has many REALLY great songs, most notably Jesus Walks and Last Call. Jesus Walks is a song everyone will be talking about, and Last Call tells the story of how he got his rap deal, and all the drama he went through. Other superb songs are Through the Wire (his first single), The New Workout Plan, All Falls Down, Never Let Me Down, and Family Business. These songs, on most rap albums, would be the best songs on them. They make this album really good, and addicting. But there's just a little problem...<br />Most of the other songs are good, but maybe 2 are rather bland and stinkers. Breathe In, Breathe Out is one that especially comes to mind. Compared to the other songs, it's bad. Songs like these bring the album down from a classic to just a good purchase. The skits also really mess up the flow of this CD. 2 Skits back to back? No thanks. Some are pretty good, and make the album flow, but come on now, enough is enough. The best sequence on College Dropout are Tracks 7-11, in which Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, Get Em High, Workout Plan (Skit), and The New Workout Plan are all played in sucession. All of these songs are great, and the skit works into the next song. Why can't the whole album be like this?<br />Due to a lack of contiued excellence across the CD, the best I can give it is a 4. Is it a great mainstream CD? Yes. Better than The Black Album? By far. Worth 12 bucks? Yes. A classic? No, not yet.
0553801546|5.0|In my humble opinion this is an amazing read. It kept you trying to figure out things until the very end. It was an amazing way of wrapping up everything in Fitz's life, and of the characters of the world. I found the book to live upto Robin Hobb's normal style of greatness.<BR>From starting the series from the beginning so long ago, I had always hoped for this second trilogy to continue everything in the world and to give Fitz a true end that he deserved. This does that in spades. In humble beginnings with the finding of him in the campaign that Verity is on in Assassin's Apprentice, to the end of the world it seemed like in Assassin's Quest, to an island truly in the middle of no where. The world has been built and truly gave deversity and extreme realism to the characters and their lives.
0440224764|4.0|Patrick Lanigan once was a well-like, well-paid young partner in a flourishing Mississippi law firm, with a pleasurable future ahead of him. Then he did the most unbelievable thing. He faked his death, watched, nearby in a tree, his own burial, then stole ninety million dollars from his own firm and vanished into the night, ran from his life and into a new one, or did he? But after four and a half years of living on the run, with shadows behind him, shadows that he couldn&iexcl;¦t see but only felt, shadows that kept him awake at night, they finally tracked him down. Now he is back home where it all began and where it will all eventually end, as a new story is about to emerge because Patrick knows the truth, something that no one else in the world knows he knows. The truth about money and greed, but perhaps, not enough about it to help him to the end.<br />The Partner, like many of Grisham&iexcl;¦s other books, are full of surprises and a true page-turner. As the story slowly unravels itself, I find myself unable to put the book down. Continuously throughout the book, it is full of surprises, all the way to the very end with the most startling ending. Though my initial reaction to the ending was disbelief and disappointment, nevertheless, when I thought about it, I found it wasn&iexcl;¦t that bad after all. How many people fake their deaths, steal ninety million dollars, get caught, then freed with thirty million dollars left and still live happily ever after? Sometimes in life, things just don&iexcl;¦t happen the way you expected it to. Sometimes people just aren&iexcl;¦t the way you expected them to be. Especially when it comes to money, large amounts of money, let&iexcl;¦s say, in the millions. Because sometimes, even the most trusted person, the most unexpected person, can&iexcl;¦t protect himself or herself from the seductive desire for more money.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is one of the best animated features to come along in a very long time (and I say this as a huge fan of Disney).  It provides excellent entertainment for all ages.  There may be some humour that is not overly appropriate for children, but it is done in such a way that the kids don't even catch it.  Dreamworks did an amazing job of bringing together big talent for such a piece of animation - and you can completley immerse yourself in the story.  Mike Myers is outstanding as Shrek (as usual) and Eddie Murphy is a hoot.  John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz are excellent additions to the cast.  Personally, I can't wait for Shrek 2 to come out - same cast, continuing the story - should be great!  I would recommend this DVD before any other.
0440180295|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I'd give this book four and a half stars if I could, it's funny but deals with serious subjects.  Slaugtherhouse-Five foucus on the life of Billy Piligrim, a quite timid,man who is able to travel through time to different points in his life.  Billy jumps from being a POW, like Vonnegut, to a sucsessful optometrist, to a human being in an alien zoo.  Much of the book focuses on Billy as a POW who was a survivor of the fire-bombing of Dresden.  After the war, Billy becomes sucsessful, but begins to mentally fall apart, he doesn't like his wife and is not close to his children.  When the aliens from Tralfamadore capture Billy they explain all moments, past, present, and future, are structerd and cannot be changed so he accepts all that has happend.  One aspect of the book I like is that you can see how things Billy has already seen in the future effect his life in the past and vice-versa.  This funny look at the life of a mentally deteriorating man and many aspects of culture is defently worth a read.
B000059ZLH|3.0|I love Dream Theater but this DVD is a huge letdown visually!  This is a taped performance not filmed.  Plus the video effects are laughable at best.  I mean these are cheesy basic video editing machine tricks(mirror image, hippie like tye dye backgrounds and the like).  Musically, Dream Theater are amazing, but this DVD just fails to visually deliver the power of their music and instead makes it feel cheesy which is a damn shame! Next time guys, release a DVD that is visually on on par as your studio albums are sonically
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is classic.  Kanye West is truly on another level.  Far beyond boring mellow drama rappers like eminem.  Kanye makes true soul music.  You can hate on him all you want but he is doing his thing now!  The story of the album is of a true great.  A man who appreciates where he is and says f*&amp;# you to anyone that doubted him.  This album is tangable evidence that if you follow your dreams with passion and soul than you can achieve anything. Kanye's verses are raw as hell.  He is the truth!
B000050XEI|4.0|I always enjoyed Enya because of her fresh sounds and harmonies.  One could feel as if they live in a fantasy world, just listening to a full CD.  This CD is no exception to her heavenly voice.  All the voices you hear are hers, (she dubs her voice so that she is like singing with herself)  Because of this, you get the sense that one angelic body is singing, yet have the chorus type feel.<BR>I give this CD four stars not because she lacks as a singer, but because two others reasons.  1.) As others have stated, the CD is very short.  2.) The songs that are available on the CD seem to be one, alike.  Only a few of the songs &quot;stick out&quot; to be unique.  I enjoy Enya because of her uniqueness among others.  Still, this is a great CD to have among any CD collections.  I felt longing for more, but I didn't become satisfied, because there wasn't any more.  This CD runs to be about 30-40 minutes long.<br />Other recommended buys:<BR>Adiemus: Songs of Sanctuary<BR>Enya: Watermark<BR>Enya: The Celts<br />Enya: Memory of Trees<BR>Enya: Shepherd Moon<br />If you all ready have any of these, and like them, chances are you will enjoy, &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; as well.

0385510438|4.0|Each February, a Grisham novel hits the stores and immediately scores a place at the top of the bestseller list. What ensures this success? Some of it has to do with predictability; some with unpredictability. Cracking the spine of a Grisham thriller, readers know they find themselves submerged in a legal battle. The characters that will be encountered and the social issues that might be addressed are unpredictable. This combined with the effects of law and the legal system on everyman --- and just plain good storytelling --- makes Grisham's books intriguing adventures. THE LAST JUROR does not disappoint at any of these levels.<br />Many readers think Grisham's first book was THE FIRM, but that book was not Grisham's first publication. A TIME TO KILL was his first shot at courtroom fiction. Fifteen years ago, with a press run of 5,000, a small Southern publisher published A TIME TO KILL in Grisham's home state. The book received little notoriety until the popularity of THE FIRM and Grisham's second blockbuster, THE PELICAN BRIEF. After its re-release, A TIME TO KILL reached not only the bestseller list but was also a popular movie<br />THE LAST JUROR is set in the fictitious town of Clanton, Mississippi, in Ford County, which readers may recall was the setting for A TIME TO KILL, Grisham's first book. The events that are the narrative of THE LAST JUROR are recounted through the eyes of Willie Traynor, a Memphis-born and eastern-educated journalist. He comes to Clanton because one of his fellow journalism students advised him that a small local newspaper was in fact a gold mine; in addition to printing newspapers, his presses would make him fast money. After a short-term internship for the Ford County Times, the paper is forced into bankruptcy. Fortunately, Willie has what every young entrepreneur needs to start a business: a wealthy relative. With $50,000 borrowed from his grandmother, Willie rescues the paper from bankruptcy and begins his career as editor, publisher and reporter for the Ford County Times.<br />Potential readers need not fear that Grisham has written a tale of journalists and the woes of publishing a weekly tabloid. Be assured that the Grisham formula of crime, courtrooms and attorneys is still a cornerstone of this novel. In fact, savvy Grisham readers will note that several of the attorneys who they previously met in A TIME TO KILL also are characters in this novel.<br />The crime that forms the foundation of THE LAST JUROR is a brutal rape and murder committed by Danny Padgitt, scion of a powerful outlaw Ford County family. Residents fear Padgitt will use his power and influence to escape punishment for his crime. The trial occupies a substantial portion of the book and reaches an ugly climax when the defendant, upon completing his testimony and leaving the witness stand, turns to the jury and announces, &quot;You convict me and I'll get every damned one of you.&quot;<br />One of the jurors threatened is Miss Callie Ruffin. Willie meets Miss Callie as he is writing a local interest article about her unique family. All of Callie's children, save one, have overcome the segregated life of Mississippi in the 1960s to become college professors. Like many blacks in that era, they left the South to accomplish their goals. Traynor goes to Miss Callie's house in order to write about this remarkable woman and the rest, as they say, is fate. Miss Callie is selected to be the first African American to serve on a jury in Ford County. She is the last juror selected in the trial of Danny Padgitt.<br />There is something loving and stirring when John Grisham writes about his native Mississippi. His affection for his home state shows, as he describes not only the people of the South but the lifestyle they have cultivated. As Grisham describes the region during the tumultuous time frame of the Civil Rights era and the Vietnam War, he is honest enough to acknowledge both the good and bad of the region. Reading Grisham, the reader is struck by the fact that the South is not as evil as most Northerners often portray, but also not as noble as most Southerners would like to believe.<br />In addition to the historical ruminations about his beloved South, Grisham delivers the twisting and turning conclusion that his readers have grown to expect. THE LAST JUROR may be the best of his recent novels. Just like Miss Callie's comforting home cooking, it is pleasant to have another John Grisham novel on the reading table --- and it's as satisfying to complete this as it is to finish a fine meal of Southern cuisine.<br />   --- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Lenny Bruce was right. There is nothing sadder than an old hipster.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Really good movie.Has lots of action in it. Mostly fighting this movie. Shows you what happens at the end .But leaves you to think about if neo is okay like the matrix reloaded. Wicked awesome movie.
6305603847|5.0|I am not a person that would normally be inclined to watch a movie such as this.  Music just is not my favorite thing.  There are people out there who love music, spend a lot of money on it, and know every important song from every decade. Whatever.  Me, I listen to music when I feel like it, and expend no more effort than that.  I rarely buy an album, and I normally listen to talk radio.<br />So why on Earth would I like this movie so much?  It's simple; it's an entertaining movie that symbolizes the struggle within men to make sense of their existence.  The Wall is the semi-autobiographical story of Roger Water's life.  Made from the musical album that shares it's name, The Wall takes us through the ups and downs of a fictionalized rock star (representing Roger Waters) and explains the difficulty of losing a parent at a young age, shows the pain of having an overprotective mother, and numerous other elements to life.<br />Finally, this movie is entertaining.  For a movie that lacks a lot of dialogue, and is just based on symbolizing the aspects of the album it's based on, The Wall does not bore.  I say this movie is easily worth the price of admission.
0553381709|1.0|This book could have been cut by half.  Full of insignificant descriptions, overly long conversations and paragraphs that do not add to the plotline or to the richness of the imagination.  i found it extremely difficult to get through this book, and usually i have no problems getting through books - i read through terry goodkind's faith of the fallen and wizards first rule in one day each.  I was very excited to receive this copy of storm of swords, hearing so much about it, and the first two chapters were quite promising.  we are introduced to characters, there was a ton of potential conflicts...yet somehow by chapter 5 i was snoozing and feeling quite annoyed, bored, and cheated.<br />orson scott card, terry goodkind, fiest, jordan, tolkien...all much much better, more engaging writers!
B000060P79|1.0|Just as the members of Faith No More may be kicking themselves for inadvertently influencing nu metal, the guys from the Buzzcocks must be giving themselves concussions for spawning one of the worst genres of music ever created alongside hair metal: pop punk. The fact that 20 years ago that name alone would have been considered an oxymoron is only further proof that this is musical cancer. However, unlike, nu metal, which is dwindling, pop punk is still in full force. It dominates the music scenes of Southern California, Florida and parts of Canada, truly horrible.<br />Where to start? Ok, first of all the legions of mall punk, which includes the abortion-worthy Blink-182, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Something Corporate, Sum 41 and the like, are virtually indistinguishable. I have trouble telling them apart! C'mon how can you swallow this? Image wise, these bands are made up of preppie surf jocks in Dickies and finely spiked hair who have gone through the entire cheerleading squad at their high school. You have to acknowledged the fact that these people would have been considered the antithesis of what punk was during it's inception. Then we come to the subject matter: My blonde ditzy girlfriend, my boredom in high school, acting &quot;punk&quot; at the mall with all my other Vans-wearing buddies, and venting about the lows of living in white suburbia....wow. I may not have grown up in the 60's but the Stooges' self titled album speaks worlds more on teenaged summer boredom than any of these idiots.It's almost as disturbing as Dashboard Confessional singer Chris Carrabba's obsession with highschool grabass romance at the age of 27! Get over it. And the music? Well, it doesn't deserve any description of it's lousyness. Punk isn't a genre known for musical ability but this has gone too far.<br />Most fans of this crap would cover their ears in pain at mere listen of Minor Threat or Black Flag's vicious onslaught, or be completely unsure of what to think of Refused's wide palette of artistic expression. Hell, I'm sure some are even dumb enough to wonder why Fugazi are considered punk when their members don't look like J Crew models. This is a great evil in the world today and it needs to stop. Every teen comedy, every surfing film, every California frat party is layered with the poison that is pop punk. Fight the power.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|I watched L'Auberge Espagnole because of the presence of Audrey Tautou, the luminous star of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's masterful Amélie, but it ended up as a complete surprise. Tautou has a relatively minor role, but the film didn't even need her. I didn't know what to expect, but I found it to be one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. It sucked me right in from the beginning. The main character is Xavier, a French student who goes to Barcelona Spain to study. There he stays in an apartment with about six other people all from different European countries. He's studying economics, but he finds that he learns more from his roommates than he ever may in school.<br />This is a bright, dazzling, lovely film. The cast is excellent with many interesting characters. Several different languages are spoken (mostly French, English and Spanish) and the differences between them provide much of the subject matter. Of course there are many romantic entanglements, both serious and humorous, and subplots and side stories which take us deeper into the lives of the characters. By the end of the film, I really felt like I knew these characters and wanted to spend more time with them. It's a two-hour film, but I didn't want it to end. I could have easily sat through another hour of it. At the end, however, I really felt fulfilled, and much like Xavier in the film, felt that I had learned a little about life and how valuable our experiences are. <br />L'Auberge Espagnole is a wonderful, thoroughly enjoyable film about human relationships and experience that is both comic and poignant. I loved it and I look forward to seeing it a second time. Highly recommended.
0307277674|3.0|I really loved \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" when I first read it in January 2004. I devoured 20 pages every evening, and every evening I looked forward to my next fix. Dan Brown has created a really exciting thriller, and what makes it especially appealing is that it is based on a lot of historical information that I found very interesting.<br /><br />Although \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is fiction, Dan Brown writes in a prolog the following: \\"FACT: ... All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" This added to my liking of the book, convincing me that Dan Brown really was providing a thriller built around a factual framework.<br /><br />In February 2004 I was in Paris, and decided to bring \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" with me and to relive some of the exciting Paris scenes \\"on site\\", so to speak.<br /><br />My first stop was the church of Saint-Sulpice. Sure enough, the \\"rose line\\" described by Dan Brown was there, strange as it sounded from the description in the book. Sitting in the huge old church and listening to the beautiful organ music while rereading the relevant chapters of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was quite an experience!<br /><br />On to the Louvre, with the expectation of an even greater feeling of being right there where the (fictitious) action had occurred. But there I encountered the sad truth: Dan Brown's descriptions of various aspects of the Louvre are simply false.<br /><br />The most blatant and problematic discrepancy concerns \\"La Pyramide Invers&eacute;e\\", which plays an important role in the book. According to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" this inverted pyramid is situated within the Louvre, such that one passes it after entering the main pyramid and going from there to the Denon Wing of the Louvre. Also, the tip of this inverted pyramid is described as being six feet from the floor below it, and the tiny pyramid below the inverted pyramid is described as looking like it protrudes up from down below the floor.<br /><br />Reality is quite different. \\"La Pyramide Invers&eacute;e\\" is actually outside of the Louvre building proper. It is in the middle of an underground shopping mall between the two wings of the Louvre, between a Virgin Megastore (CD's, DVD's, etc.) and an Esprit shop (fashion clothes). Furthermore, it actually comes down to about three feet from the floor, and the tiny pyramid under it looks like it just sits on top of the floor.<br /><br />The other major discrepancy concerns the way Dan Brown describes how Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu meet in a public lavatory in the Louvre. The book says, \\"Here at the westernmost tip of the Denon Wing, the north-south thoroughfare of Place du Carrousel ran almost flush with the building with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the Louvre's outer wall.\\"<br /><br />Wrong again. There are no public lavatories at the western tip of the Denon Wing. The north-south street that goes around Place du Carrousel does not go past the western tip of the Louvre, it cuts through the Louvre in the middle of the two wings. But there aren't any public lavatories there either so the action that is described as taking place there is not possible.<br /><br />(Incidentally, in the movie based on this book, the first discrepancy is glossed over, and the second one is partially corrected. You can see traffic going through the arch in the building, not past the end of the building. But there's still no public lavatory there in reality.)<br /><br />Nit-picking? Perhaps. But if Dan Brown is cutting corners with \\"facts\\" that he proclaimed to be correct, what about the rest of the historical facts that made the book so interesting? Did he make up or modify these facts too? The assumption that this is probably the case has become unavoidable for me, and this reduces my liking of the book significantly.<br /><br />There are a lot of other details in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" that I found incorrect or very unlikely when I first read the book, but none of them fell into the category of something that Dan Brown had claimed to be authentic. However, the architecture of the Louvre is specified as being correct, and it isn't, and that's where credibility is damaged, and the appeal of the book as being a great thriller based on a framework of reality is also damaged.<br /><br />Rennie Petersenm fell into the category of something that Dan Brown had claimed to be authentic.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Prior to &quot;Through the Wire&quot; I was not even aware of who Kanye West was.  Sure I had heard his name given as a shot out by certain artists, but I didn't think much about him. But it was something about that catchy single and all the buzz I was hearing concerning him that made me curious to learn more about him and I've been so impressed ever since. I cannot remember ever anticipating an artist's debut album when, not even four months ago, I had no real idea who the person was! But there's a first for everything and this was the case for &quot;College Dropout.&quot; In this day and age, I admire REAL creativity in artists and Kanye's got the gift for creative lyrics if nothing else.  I have to say that even though there are some tight beats on alot of the songs on this album, I actually find myself paying more attention to the words (gasp!) than the beat sometimes.  This is all the more impressive when you consider that with most of the rap and hip-hop I've come across recently,the beat is the only semi-worthwhile thing about the song (if you can even understand what's being said at all!) He speaks so much truth and gives alot of mature insights about real life issues without being preachy or condescending and that's why I'm an even bigger fan of his now.  Standout tracks (or, rather, tracks I've repeatedly played a hundred times by now) include:<br />&quot;All Falls Down&quot; (my FAVORITE track! I can't get enough of this song and the hook with Syleena Johnson sounds so great)<br />&quot;Jesus Walks&quot; (love the beat, love the message)<br />&quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (great beat and Jay Z represents well as usual--I really liked the spoken-word type speech given towards the end of the song.  Inspiring.)<br />&quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; (nothing really insightful here--just a fun song with a great, wicked beat)<br />&quot;Two Words&quot; (very creative), &quot;School Spirit&quot;, and &quot;Family Business&quot; are pretty great tracks, too.  The only song I really didn't care for was &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot; featuring Ludacris--it's taking me a while to feel that one.  While the little skits he included between tracks are funny and clever, I wish there had not been so many of them--I would have rather heard more tracks or something like a musical interlude.  But even these don't come even close to bringing down the quality of this album.  This album is so beyond impressive and Kanye did a great job. I went out and purchased it without waiting to hear someone else's review and I have to say the risk was worth it because my money wasn't wasted. I look forward to hearing more from Mr. West and wish him mad sucess in the future.y song I really didn't care for was &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot; featuring Ludacris--it's taking me a while to feel that one.

0529064847|4.0|First off, the translation on this bible is, for the most part, solid.  That, in itself, isn't really a compelling reason to buy it, there are plenty of other good translations out there, some perhaps even better than this one.<br />However, this one has hands down better notes than any other cheap paperback bible.  Every book of the bible has a brief, very scholarly written introduction, and clarifying footnotes on many pages.<br />What I really respect is that the introductions and footnotes and really, legitimately, scholarly.  The moralizing commentary routinely found in some &quot;study bibles&quot; is here reduced to simple notes of clarification on either odd historical points or lines that are hard to translate.  <br />More than enough to recommend this one, even to non-Catholics.  Martin Luther might not have particularly liked the extra books, but he did say people should read them.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The second movie of the second book of the Harry Potter series is as fun as the first one. The visual effects are really nice, such as the Dobby character and the Quidditch matches. The casting of the new characters are really fitting, too. It is one of those movies that you sit and enjoy either wit or without the kids.
0790729350|5.0|I just recently purchased this on DVD, and it's the most stunning piece of music video, I have ever seen.<br />We are treated to 2 things about the 60's, in this video alone...<br />1. We are shown amazing performances of music from the era's greatest music performers: Jefferson Airplane, Joe Cocker, Country Joe &amp; The Fish, Santana, The Who, Ten Years After, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, etc.<br />2. We are shown a deep look at the counterculture. Whether it be a bunch of hippies trippin' out on Marijuana &amp; LSD, people who enjoyed skinny-dipping, the spiritual side of it with Yoga and Trancendental Meditation, and what to do in the rain... Strip naked and roll around in the mud.<br />And nobody cared about it, because it was a place of peace. And peace what all that they wanted, and for 3 days everybody received peace.<br />There are a few downsides to this film, though...<br />1. No Performance from The Grateful Dead, just Jerry Garcia rollin' a few joints.<br />2. They don't have Sly &amp; The Family Stone's Dance To The Music in the video, that was a song that got the whole crowd up and going, but all we get is &quot;I Want To Take You Higher.&quot;<br />But they're only miniscule things, the video is amazing. The spirit of the 60's, will live on forever, thanks to this festival and movie.<br />And DAMN RIGHT! This movie did deserve to win the Oscar!!!<br />Buy the video if you want, but be warned, there will be an everlasting effect to wear tie-dye and put up the 2-finger salute.<br />-Peace-
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar have been coming up with all these incredible animations for the past few years. What one can do with the computers is beautiful and this one is a good example of their high quality artwork. The computer graphics are so nicely made and the story is both educational and fun for kids and it is also offering adults a good couple of hours of entertainment. My personal favorite were the turtles, &quot;dude it's awesome!&quot;
0684800713|5.0|This interesting piece of expatriate literature is a fascinating look at the post World War One &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; to which Hemingway himself claimed to belong.  Through the eyes of the main character, Jake, we see what life was like for an American living in Europe in the post-war years.  The relationship between Jake and the other main character, Brett, provides another interesting view of the moral and social values of this time.  The plot of the novel is focused on bullfighting in Spain, though the fights seem to be merely a backdrop for the interaction between Brett, her fiancee Mike, Jake, and their American friends Robert and Bill.  Throughout the book, we see interaction between the characters that reflect Hemingway's view of expatriate society at that time.<BR> <BR>This is a very entertaining book.  It is lighter than some of Hemingway's other work (such as For Whom the Bell Tolls), and is in some ways more readable.  The book is very well written, but the dialogue is what makes this work truly great.  It is at times funny, at times serious, at times biting, and at times just plain entertaining.  This is the book that made Hemingway a force to be reckoned with, and, reading it, I can see why.  This is a great book for any fan of Hemingway or for anyone interested in good modern literature.
B0001AP12G|5.0|kanye is sexy and extemely talented i love this album. this is one of those albums where you can play it all the way though. my favorite songs are grauduation day, all falls down, spaceship,slow jamz,school sprit,two words,through the wire,and last call. i could really relate to the subject matter. his lyrics were funny and creative. when you look at the title of the album college dropout you might think that he is trying to tell you that school is not important but in some of the songs and intreludes he is basically saying that school was not for him and sometimes we as teenagers just go to college because are parents want us to or we just think that's the next step. on his song last call at the end of this song he talks about how he got his record deal and how he met jay-z and started making beats. this is a great album i hope it doesn't get overlooked
B00008EYA5|5.0|I loved this movie.  I don't know what it was, but it was really good.  I thought it had a good story and it was really cool, it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Yeah, yeah, some parts are unlikely, but hey, it's a movie! Enjoy it!
B00004YW6I|5.0|I've been a big fan of PJ Harvey since her debut album Dry back in 1992, and I feel that Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea is her greatest album yet. <br />I simply cannot understand why any fan would want an artist to churn out the same emotions and musical style album after album. So she sounds unapologetically happy on this record, so she's having fun with a few lighter melodies and catchy choruses. Deal with it, grow up. Just because it's not as angry and abrasive as Rid of Me, that hardly means she has \\"sold out\\" or \\"gone soft\\" - this is the language of elitist underground snobs who take some sadistic, voyeuristic pleasure from the pain in her earlier records. It's a cheap, tired, lazy excuse for not trying to understand when a GREAT artist is coming from a different direction from that which you're comfortably familiar with. I can't see how some people feel there is less depth, range or emotional intensity on this amazing album. She still writes with staggering passion, she still sings with blistering energy, as if her life depended on it; she still rocks harder than anyone else around on tracks like Big Exit, The Whores Hustle and the Hustlers Whore and Kamikaze. There is still plenty room for intense identification with all the heightened emotional extremes on this record. Personal joy and romantic love are emotions that are every bit as valid, true and important for an artist to express as the darker stuff they have established their name doing. The positive mood on songs like Good Fortune or This is Love is just as thrilling, dynamic and exhilarating to behold as the bitter rage of Rid of Me or the mournful melancholy of To Bring You My Love.<br />I also don't get the criticism that this record is less adventurous or experimental than her previous work like Is This Desire? After building up a solid cult fanbase with darker music, she's risking her well-established reputation and her audience's long-held perception of her by daring to try out a few lighter, happier sounds. Can't people understand, that this IS a brave and experimental move for her to make? And anyway, it's not like there's no tension, violence and hard, steely edges still left in the music - there's still enough references to genocide, suicide, syphilis and warfare to keep any self-respecting pain junkie satisfied! <br />Essentially though, it should all boil down to the music - and the music on this album is bloody brilliant from start to finish. Big Exit is one of the greatest opening tracks in recent memory, charging like a bull out of the gates and punching you between the eyes. Good Fortune is addictive, infectious fun and one of the most genuinely romantic love songs in ages. A Place Called Home, One Line, This Mess We're In and We Float are laced with heartbreakingly beautiful melodies and poetic images of love lost and found. Horses In My Dreams is one of her most tender, naked, vulnerable songs to date, and enormously moving for that reason. <br />Like all great rock artists, Polly Harvey changes, grows and evolves with each record she releases - whether or not her fanbase can keep up with her. I admire her courage in working without a safety net and exploring new territory with every release. Rock on Polly, and stay true to your heart.
B000001FI7|5.0|I just love this cd so much, whenever i'm feeling depressed i just pop thi cd in and it makes me feel better about my state of being. I wasn't too familiar with them when this cd first came out, i heard them first when my sister got the cd; it was probably around the time it came out. I think it was the first band i ever liked that had a female singer. I really like the bassiness of the songs, the sound quality, lyrics, slowness, is what i think makes this album great. I'm actually listening to it right now. The lyrics make me think of myself, even though i'm male, i believe the lyrics of the songs are universal.
B00000GAMF|4.0|When I finally &quot;broke down&quot; and gave Marillion an open berth to my ears and lobes, I didn't know where to start. I let a friend who had been into them for years guide me, and I wound up buying &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Season's End&quot;, and &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; all at once. On first listens, I would say that &quot;Brave&quot; was my favorite of the three.<br /> Now it's over 3 years hence, and all 3 CD's have grown on me immensely. However, when all is said and done, &quot;Brave&quot; is still my favorite. I don't quite get the debate over Fish vs. Steve Hogarth as to who is the better singer. I think it's all in the material they worked with. Both are strong. Now wash your hands.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This album has the best score I've heard in a long time. The music composed my Howard Shore beautifully captures the majic of The Lord of the Rings.Both the extreme sadness, desperation and triumph that make up the the Return of the King. A great work of art and well worth the money.
0767812166|5.0|This is a classic that can be watched over and over. One of those movies you always remember seeing the first time and when seen again, you get that original feeling all over again. Starman (Jeff Bridges) was great integrating his alien persona with the DNA of Karen Allen's dead husband. His nomination for best actor 1984 was well deserved. Charles Martin Smith was just as good playing the role of a Gov't employed member of SETI--he quickly realized who the true enemy was--an over the top Government CIA/FBI/Special Agent etc. who was more interested in cutting up Bridges' character than welcoming him to our world---remember the gold disks message--welcome to planet earth! This one is a winner.    .
B00005B36H|5.0|I always compare this album with my favority CD's of Dimitri Shostakovich . These classical masterpieces contain complex musical structures and are rather abstract, do not expect to find concrete melodic sounds on it!!! However after listening several times to it, you discover the genious aspect : after a time, your mind starts to discover structures in the sound and you discover always new tricks. While you might not notice it the first times you hear it, it contains so much variation that you start feeling deep respect for the craftmanship. <BR>In fact you can have the same feeling by studying abstract mathematics (not to be confused with the boring calculus stuff you learn at high school ...). All these things require an effort to delve into, but the reward is most of the time greater then effort ...<BR>That is why you can listen hundreds of times to this music without getting bored. I have the same experience with Tool 's Lateralus CD. Sure, there will always a group of people who don ' t like this music, and let 's be happy that meanigs can differ, this makes it an exiting world, isn't it... But I strongly advice to everybody to take the effort to try to discover whether this music is something for you...Have fun with it ...
0156027321|4.0|Pi, an engaging little character, a solution without end, embarks first on a spiritual journey of knowing and ends in a literal odyssey across the merciless blue seas.  Pi, ship wrecked and stranded on a raft, must accomodate Richard Parker, a majestic Bengal tiger.  Together they defeat hyenas, marauders, flesh consuming islands of vegetation, and unforgiving nature.  When at last they reach land, civilization, Richard Parker disappears into a jungle without a backward glance and little Pi is left to finish the tale. Confronted with unbelievers regarding his tale of survival, Pi offers them another version, a distinctly unsentimental tale of human baseness, courage, and the will to live.  It seems both stories are equally true.  That is Pi's message. Hindu or Christian, Pi or Richard Parker, the version you choose matters little.  The only question that remains; do you prefer a story with animals or without?
B00005JMCW|4.0|.<br />Good kids/teen family PG Movie<br />Summary:<br />Playful script, good rock `n' roll music, pleasant and funny movie.  Good acting by Lindsay Lohan (the \\"Parent Trap\\" twins!), and, of course, Jamie Lee Curtis, and surprisingly nice job by Mark Harmon - he really fit the older adopting dad part!<br />Both Lindsay and Jamie really make great character switches to pull this off.  I expected that from Lindsay since she did such a great job in parent trap; but Jamie really pulled off the idiosyncracies of being a teenager with the right mannerisms, attitude and terminology!<br />Story:<br />Anna (Lindsay Lohan) and mother/widow Dr. Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) do not relate at all - ironically since Dr. Coleman is a famous psychiatrist who write books on the subject!<br />A Chinese Fortune Cookie Curse causes them to exchange bodies just before Tess' wedding, leading each other to better understand the daily trials of each others lives.  Walking in each others shoes, Mom finds out that Anna is not just paranoid, but her teacher and ex-best friend are really out to get her; and Anna discovers that Mom's perfect world is not so perfect, and in fact can be a bit scary.  She also learns that maybe everyone in the family is not out to get her like she thought.<br />Both run a full circle and grow closer through their ordeal.
B000089RVX|1.0|this album is pure pop with songs that make the beach boys seem heavy<br />they are certanly not goth.  they admited themselvs that they are not goth<br />and how could anyone possibly label them metal?  what kind of metal would you think they are hmmm lets see...   NONE  people who listen to evanescence dont even know what kinds of metal are out ther, like death metal, hardcore, black metal, grindcore, speed metal, classic black metal, thrash metal, norweigen black metal, classic thrash metal, satanic black metal, and more...<br />but if you like pop music then i would recoment this album to all you pop fans<br />but if you start buying your clothes at hot topic to be like all the other posers than go listen to some real music like napalm death, gorgoroth, god dethroned, cannibal corpse, hatebreed, burzum, immortal, ulver, mayhem, slayer, arch enemy, cradle of filth, dimmu borgir, sepultura, devildriver, mastodon, and Zyklon<br />so please to all you posers, eather stop or get into some real music
B00000FCBC|5.0|If you are a fan of Metallica, then this is a set of songs you will enjoy. These songs were selected because Metallica enjoyed them, and were influenced by the artists who wrote them. Metallica does bring their unique style to the songs, and in a way, improves on them for the Metallica fan. But don't get me wrong, I still listen to the originals too. Definitely a buy for the fan.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|First, I reiterate that this is a good, borderline great, film. Not perfect, but admirable. <br />Next, I am not a film fascist, nor do I have a PhD. If I did, it would not be in Film. I don't even really care for film that much. You \\"respond\\" to allegations I never make--what we refer to as the \\"strawman\\" here in the academic community.<br />1. Of course non-PhD's can understand art and have reactions to it. I have never said you had to have a PhD, or in your case, an MA from UC-Irvine, a fine school for literary theory, to understand art. I said you had to understand a particular concept, one in which few people are educated either formally or informally, in order FULLY to GET the film. <br />2. I did not say that \\"the only reason\\" to dislike the movie would be failure to understand it. One may dislike the movie without failing to understand it, as I specifically pointed out in my review, in the part where I was wishing more such reviewers would offer what I consider helpful criticism of the film. None of this means that it is impossible to dislike something *because* you don't understand it. Lack of understanding, then, may be a sufficient condition without being a necessary one, to butcher the art of logic a bit.<br />2. Nor am I pompous. There is nothing wrong with not understanding postmodernism, not understanding academic concepts, or not understanding literature at all. However, if you don't, AND you hated this film with a flaming, one-star passion, there may be a connection. <br />3. People who do not understand postmodernism, which is indeed an academic concept and NOT something you understand intuitively, contrary to your assertion, are not going to understand why the characters are flat. Some people may intuitively enjoy the film anyway, as I think I would have before learning these things, as I enjoyed the Virgin Suicides when that film came out (although I admit freely that I didn't really, fully \\"get\\" it until years later). Some people may see the supposed requirement of fast-moving action and three-dimensional characters as shallow, based on intuition. Those who don't may simply believe that they are applying a calculus that is relevant to all movies (e.g., characters should not be flat or generic or whatever) without realizing the authorial/directorial intent behind it. <br />4. Comparing flat characters with \\"bad\\" special effects is silly and misleading, as the term \\"bad\\" makes evident. \\"Flat\\" characters are not, in this case, \\"bad.\\" They may not be to an individual's taste, which is fine, but they don't constitute an actor's or director's failure in all cases. People who say \\"the characters were flat\\" act as though they are pointing out a flaw, not something intentional. Some movies are not meant to be effects-driven or are meant to have stylized scene-design or effects rather than realistic ones, but \\"bad\\" special effects usually refers to those of low-budget films that are trying but can't do any better. Again with the strawman.<br />5. The film is extremely postmodern in certain key regards. What are you talking about?! It is less postmodern than Coppola's earlier film, The Virgin Suicides, and doesn't deal with every important postmodern theme, but the centrality of communication problems (see also: the title) and of characters seeking to construct their identities around others and others' reflections of them should suffice.<br />Since you teach writing, as I have, I'm sure it is frustrating for you when students reject concepts or rules because they don't understand them, or at least without regard to understanding them--from paragraph structure to split infinitives to postmodernism or whatever else. <br />Many, many people, at least judging by Amazon reviewers, simply don't seem to get that not everything is supposed to fit into what we academics (nudge, nudge) term \\"realism.\\" Realism is something that anyone can \\"get\\" as well as enjoy and something that non-academic types seem to prefer. People oftensay, \\"Such and such film wasn't realistic,\\" regardless of whether it aimed for realism or not. This bothers me. That's all I was saying, neighbor.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd absolutely blew me away when I first heard it.This is totally differant than anything I've heard and I really like it.I like hearing someone talk about stuff other than money,ho's,guns,and grinding.This is a fresh breath to Rap,get this cd!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has got to be the best sci fi that I've seen in the last decade. Fox seems to be capable of creating the best that sci fi has to offer and then destroying it. Firefly is just one example of Fox's shortsightedness. <P>Firefly is what SciFi should be about. It's not about technology or aliens or ray guns, but people set hundreds of years in the future dealing with the same issues and problems that we have now.<P>If you love SciFi, buy this movie. If you hate SciFi, but love drama, buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B00005QGAV|4.0|As the sales of ''Bad'' slowed down, Michael Jackson headed back into the studio to record ''Dangerous''. He worked on an estimated 65-70 songs before narrowing it down to the official 14 songs. His partnership with Quincy Jones came to an end with ''Dangerous'' after having worked on three album together. Instead Teddy Riley was bought into the studio. Teddy Riley practically defined the swingbeat ''craze'' in the early nineties with his own group ''Guy'', having produced many young acts, he seemed the perfect choice for Jackson. Perhaps to establish a modern R&amp;B sound Jackson turned to Riley? The young hipster managed to participate on half of the instalments on the ''Dangerous'' album. The other half was done with his engineer Bruce Swedien or with Co-writer Bill Bottrell. Guitarist Slash, Heavy D and Stephanie (The Princess Of Monaco)even make a guest appearance on the album. How is that for diversity? <br />The album opens with the bouncy and hard-hitting ''Jam''. You heard breaking glass before the beat sets off. Michael Jackson slurs his lyrics out against the aggressive beat. The lyrics seem rather unfocused, yet the message is clear-help others, believe in yourself etc. ''Jam'' reached No. 13 in the UK and No. 26 in the US. <BR>''Jam'' is quickly followed by the paranoid ''Why You Wanna Trip On Me''. As the title suggests it shall be taken literally. Why spend so much time, discussing the latest on the Michael Jackson saga when there are more important things going on in the world? At present time there may be some truth to that notion. <BR>The lustful ''In The Closet'' is nothing you would normally expect from Jackson. The lyrics are straight to the point. One of the better songs on the album. The duet, between MJ and the mystery girl, work extremely well, feeding off each as the song proceeds. Perhaps one of MJ's most raunchy songs.<BR>''She Drives Me Wild'' is another Teddy Riley collaboration. The music consists of car-like sounds, which makes the entire song unbearable listen to. Lyrical ''She Drives Me Wild'' doesn't consist of much. It's definitely one of the weakest tracks on the record. Its sound is identical to ''Why You Wanna Trip On Me'' and ''Can't Let Her Get Away'', which were produced by Teddy Riley as well.<BR>''Remember The Time'' is a bouncy, boogie-romp with a tale of past love. The lyrics suggest the main narrator has some unfinished ''work'' to do. He reminisces of their past by recalling stories/things from their relationship. The song was released as the second single and had an awesome music video accompany it.Probably one of MJ's best 90's music video with its impressive imagery. It reached No 3 in both the US and in the UK.<br />''Can't Let Her Get Away'' is quickly followed by ''Heal The World''. It is seemingly one of Jackson's most recognised songs ever. The song pleases for love and saving the world. It reached a disappointedly low No. 27 in the US, however it enjoyed great success in the UK reaching the No. 2 spot. Jumping straight into the up-beat, lead single ''Black Or White''. The song generated a buzz for the album and reached No. 1 across the globe. One of the weaker tracks on ''Dangerous'', however its pop/R&amp;B  fitting appeal made it perfectly for radio to accept. The ''popish'' song on the album. Written entirely by Michael Jackson, ''Who Is It'' is the ultimate ''betray song''. A man left by the woman he loves. The song is filled with his trademarks-the gasping and hiccups, to the point where it bounders on annoyance. ''Who Is It'' is among my favourite MJ song ever. The chorus is superb almost pleading for reasoning, whereas the verses are begging for understanding. <BR>The rocky ''Give Into Me'' is solid proof that Jackson is capable of singing rock-oriented songs as well. It is then followed by the gospel-like ''Will You Be There''. Perhaps one of Jackson's best songs. The lyrics are quite relevant at the present time, asking the listener if he/she will be there during his joys and sorrows.<BR>The ''churchy'' instalment ''Keep The Faith'' was written by Sheidah Garrett and Glen Ballad (co-written with Jackson), who penned ''Man In The Mirror'' for Jackson as well. ''Keep The Faith'' is no near as enjoyable as ''Man In The Mirror'', however the second half of the song gives the former a run for its money. The lovely ''Gone Too Soon'' is a ballad about loss of a love one. It was dedicated to Ryan White, a boy suffering from AIDS. The albums ends with the album title track ''Dangerous''. A ramble of noise with a non-existing melody. <br />''Dangerous'' has often been hailed for its diversity. You have pop, rock, gospel and funky swingbeat productions in one complete package. Overall ''Dangerous'' is a solid effort, however several of the songs lack strength with its complete lack of melodies-''Can't  Let Her Get Away'', She Drives Me Wild and  the tittle song ''Dangerous''. Michael Jackson has always been a advocate for melodies, so the non-existing melodies come as a bit of a surprise to me. Another issue is the overproduced sound that has plagued Jackson for years.It  is evident on the ''Dangerous''  album as well and ruins several of the songs.<BR>Having said that ''Dangerous'' is overall an enjoyable effort and when the songs work...boy do they work. Some of Jacksons most memorable and best songs are included on ''Dangerous''-''Remember The Time'', ''Who Is It'', ''Will You Be There'', ''In The Closet'', ''Heal The World'' etc. Should be included in your Michael Jackson collection.<br />Overall rate: 8/10
0553573403|5.0|George R. R. Martin has done fantasy right.  He weaves an incredible narrative full of thoroughly engaging characters, intricate plots and plot-twists, spooky supernatural elements, an immense and detailed landscape and setting, and holds the readers interest throughout this 800+ page tome.  Martin succeeds where many fantasy authors fail because he is able to tell an interesting story within a fantastic setting.  He is most concerned with the story and its characters and the elements of the fantasy world build those characters and plots up rather than detracting from them.  Too much of modern fantasy is focused on the mystical wonders of the world and not enough on the inhabitants of the world.  George R. R. Martin's characters are the center of the book and that is why this is such an incredible read.  I can not wait to go on to read the rest of the series.
B000002GIE|5.0|At first listen, this début album seemed mediocre in its delivery!  A couple of tracks, when FIRST reviewed, appeared to be simply composed as filler material.  Quite a bit of its composition echoes forth earlier artists instrumental techniques and arrangement styles.  As a listener, I had to make an effort to resist branding Extreme with a stereotypical label right out of the gate.  Unfortunately, this group's worse critic was the passing of time, and the popular trends of that time.  The release of this album took place during the dying age of 80's rock.  Hair band's had reigned throughout much of the decade, and a changing of the guard was clearly taking place amongst the differing musical genres.  Okay, enough of the history lesson...<br />This album exhibits great lyrical and instrumental composition!  Gary Cherone's vocal execution is \\"A\\" 4/40 on many tracks.  Rough enough to ride the jagged edge of heavy metal, but yet, well refined during tracks like \\"Rock A Bye Bye.\\"  And harmony!  My god!  The WHOLE band is able to contribute their vocal artistry on many of the songs contained within.  I now have an adequate defense against the claims that that harmony is dead in today's modern music.  Sure, my ear picks up reminiscent tones of earlier bands like Queen, but come on!  I believe that even Freddy would be somewhat pleased with the little \\"Rock A Bye\\" ditty.  No wonder Van Halen wanted Cherone as their front man when Sammy made his exit.<br />Nuno Bettencourt is phenomenal on this whole album.  Perhaps I am hearing evidence of influential artists like Vetto Bratta, Brian May, Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, and tidbits of others, but the clarity of keyed notes and technical mastery brings forth a refreshing cacophony of sound fidelity.<br />Bottom line!  This release deserves allot more respect than was first awarded over a decade ago.  Other than \\"Three Sides To Every Story\\", this album displays the very best that Extreme had to offer...and more!  It is difficult to fathom that THIS was their début release.
B00008O31H|5.0|It's a struggle to find bands creating music today that doesn't sound like half-a-million other bands.  The Black Keys have put together two albums that have their own style, soul and voice.  The two musicians are extremely cool as weel.  They hang out at the bar before their shows, casually walk up to the stage and then absolutely blow the audience away.  They are an amazing group to see live.  Enjoy!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Whoever said that In the Zone is boring compared to Stripped should have their head thoroughly examined. <BR>Except the lyrics, there is no other way Stripped can outdo In the Zone. Stripped's songs are supported by the same background which gets boring after a while. In the Zone is way more interesting with its awesome beats and tunes. <BR>My favourites in order are - Toxic, Everytime, Showdown, Breathe on me, Brave new girl, Shadow, Outrageous, MATM remix, Touch of my hand and Boom boom.<BR>There are a lot of styles on this album and the lyrics are just ok. Her voice isn't very good but altogether, the songs are a lot of fun to listen to.<BR>Worth buying
B00006F83Y|5.0|I just heard of this band when I read a Rolling Stone article on Dave Grohl and that he was going to be playing drums on all of the songs on an upcoming album, &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot; by QOTSA.  I thought, Dave is the greatest drummer ever, and all the music he has been apart of has always been great, so I'll buy the cd.  Now I believe this was one of the best rock cd's I heard in 2002.  Josh Homme is a great guitar player who is always innovative.  Nick Oliveri is a great bass player as well.  Buy this cd.  Great music.
0786869143|3.0|Only the most hardcore scientific materialist would assert, as Dr. Wiseman does, that luck is nothing more than a byproduct of our behaviors and attitudes. That undoubtedly plays a role, but to get another perspective I turned to a new book, LUCKY YOU!, by Fitzgerald, that tells a deeper, more complex and interesting story about streaks of good and bad luck. He goes far beyond Wiseman by examining, from his own experiences, from observations of others, and from the latest parapsychological research, how intuition can shape good fortune through our dreams, our attention to patterns of synchronicities,and even how we are influenced by a spiritual dimension of luck that involves the belief systems we construct around meditation practices and prayer. Contrast both books and judge for yourself which comes closer to your own personal truth.
B000002J20|1.0|I looooove Yes.  Which makes &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; even more disappointing.<br />&quot;TFTO&quot; fails ambitiously.  Obviously, many think it's a masterpiece, but I think it's Yes noodling around over a bunch of quirky time-changes and not finding the forest for the trees.  It's painful.  <br />I've listened to bits of &quot;TFTO&quot; every now and then for years.  I  finally sat and listened to it all the way through tonight.  It has moments of brilliance and half-hours that sound like Spinal Tap's idea of &quot;serious music&quot;.  It just *grates*.  <br />I like &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; much better.  Shorter, tighter, more coherent, with less noodling.  <br />If you want truly mystical magic, try composers like Penderecki, Gorecki, or Arvo Part.  Or Steve Reich compositions like &quot;Music for Eighteen Musicians&quot; or &quot;Tehillim&quot;.  Maybe even Ellen Fullman's experiments with long stringed instruments.  Yes is a wonderful prog-rock band.  In &quot;TFTO&quot; they attempted something far beyond them.  Go try out real classical mysticism and you'll hear the immense difference between the two.  <br />Still, I'm glad Yes put out &quot;TFTO&quot;.  Ya gotta shoot for the moon even if you fall in the swamp.
0553288105|3.0|Asimov presents very convincing character development, pulling the reader in and presenting many interesting twists.  Sometimes the physics was a big overwhelming, and I had to reread certain passages a number of times, and remember back to Atomic Mass theory.  I was particularly intrigued with the emerging environmental consciousness presented:  ideas of  future renewable, free energy sources, in a metaphor for our current unquestionable unquenchable pursuit of nonrenewable resources, within the ever-present myth of a free lunch.<br />Asimov explores many possibilities in the human and alien psyche, considering how our negative impulses can push us on to greatness- great glory, or great tragedy.  He investigates how the perceptions of who we are will change with time- the perceptions of others, and our self-perception.  I was engrossed- I wanted to know what was going to happen next to these characters that I cared about.  And what happened next, especially at the end of the units, was usually not what I expected.  It is a well written novel.  And therein lies the flaw.<br />Perhaps if the characters weren't so well portrayed, it wouldn't matter that we never get to find out what happens to them.  This is written more as three separate stories, around a common theme, rather than a novel.  And the three stories themselves are more slice-of-life than the traditional Western novella genre.  So we begin to care a great deal about character, only to see him disappear at the end of the first unit, and only be tangentially mentioned in the third unit.  Then we get a very interesting display of a completely foreign and alien psychology and anthropology, with 3 mates in one, and a complicated lifecycle- only to have a surprise at the end of the second unit, never fully explained, and the aliens never really again mentioned.  And in the third unit, with a long rendition of what life is like on the moon, we focus on a character tangentially mentioned in the first unit- and in this story, there is at least some completion, albeit with unfortunate gratuitous dwelling on nudity.  Each would be quite good alone, with extra material added.  But I'm left feeling that this is an unfinished novel- worse, 3 unfinished novels.  I'd rather have the author finish his own work, and not be made to complete the novel for him.in this story, there is at least some completion, albeit with unfortunate gratuitous dwelling on nudity.

B00008ADPF|1.0|This album is boring and predictable. If you like rock enough to consider buying it, move on to the next level.. Go grab a copy of A Perfect Circle's 'Thirteenth Step' instead. Do yourself a favour and get yourself some real rock music rather than this boring crap....
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Dearest wicked fan to be and everyone else,<BR>I am a 14 year old girl who is very critical when it comes to music. I am not fond of any music category in particular but I would put WICKED in a class of it's own (then again what do I know) I'm simply obsessed shall we say. I went to the musical about two weeks ago (and would strongly recommend it) and was enchanted to say the very, very... least. The leading stars have spectacular voices and Idina Menzel is just adorable (although I don't think it's a propper adj.). If I had to list the songs I loved it would range from 1 to 19 deleating 2,5,and 17 (which are under 2 minutes each). I would strongly suggest adding this item to your cart right away!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Listening to this, I am ashamed to be a member of the same species as any 'fan' of it.<BR>Are you people the same crowd that watch 'reality' TV and buy into all the commercial crap spewed forth from global corporations determined to suck the 'consumer' dry?

B00018D44U|1.0|I find Norah Jones's voice annoying, her shriek-whisper mixture <BR>of vocal performance is always driving me nuts everytime I hear <BR>her songs.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|I have seen all three movies and have two on DVD. The story of the Matrix has been superbly put together from the beginning of DISC 1 to the end of DISC 3. The story line was great.

A must to complete any DVD library
B000002J09|5.0|There are very few songs good enough to become clich&eacute;s - &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is one such song; it's one of the best rock songs ever recorded, and everyone (even people who don't know who Led Zeppelin were) seems to at least know about it. Of course, because of this it's also been somewhat abused and overplayed in guitarshops everywhere and parodied and called overrated and so on and on. Only a truly great and timeless song receives this kind of praise and scorn. The song still stands up over thirty years later, but &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; is by no means the only reason to buy this album.<br />Led Zeppelin IV, or &quot;Zoso&quot; or &quot;The Runes Album&quot; or whatever one calls it, is filled with nothing but great songs from the era before sythesizers began to invade and change popular music. It starts off hard-edged with &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; both filled with heavy rythyms, pounding drums and passionate banshee wails. Anyone over thirty has these songs firmly secured to their neurons, whether they like them or not. The album then takes a surprising turn: &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; slowly fades in and beatiful acoustic guitar and mandolin take over from the heavy blues of the first two songs. Some claim that this song's lyrics refer to J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; (specifically, the Battle of Pelennor Fields in &quot;Return of the King&quot;); lines such as &quot;The ringwraiths ride in black&quot; don't dispute this. Regardless, the song is a surprsing contrast, no drums, and lots of delay on the voice make for a ethereal mood that is a great segueway into &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Even though some think of Led Zeppelin as &quot;hard rockers&quot; or &quot;Rock and Roll  hooligans&quot;, these last two songs prove that they were much, much more: they were fully capable of writing beautiful and poignant music that holds up out of the era it was created in (Robert Plant's own self-deprecating remarks about Led Zeppelin notwithstanding). I hate to sound corny, but this is timeless rock music. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; takes the mood created by &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; and slowly and brilliantly twists it back into the mood of the album's beginning: hard distorted rock. I think this is where the original LP's side one ended, so originally the record had to be flipped, but on CD the show roars perfectly on into &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; (another Tolkien reference?). &quot;Four Sticks&quot; continues the momentum, it's a great song but it probably stands out the least from the others. &quot;Going to California&quot; is another song in the vein of &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; - acoustic guitar, no drums, mellow mood. The song is supposedly a tribute to Joni Mitchell (whose incredible album &quot;Blue&quot; - released the same year as Led Zeppelin IV - contains the song &quot;California&quot;). Lastly, one of the greatest album endings of all time: &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;. What more can one say?<br />Much has been made about the cryptic album art: the runes, the symbols, the painting of the man on what looks like a war-torn wall. Supposedly Jimmy Page is the only one who knows what all of this means. Maybe it's interesting, maybe it's not. All I know is that I'd rather listen to the great music on the album than spend my time decrypting the code of the cover and liner notes. Still, the art and symbols add a certain mystique to the album, and they definitely don't detract from the music.<br />Led Zeppelin's fourth album is arguably one of the greatest rock albums ever. It's moody, cryptic, and contains at least one of the best known songs of the twentieth century. It will doubtlessly be listened to well into the twenty-first century.recating remarks about Led Zeppelin notwithstanding).

B000002HRE|1.0|one word sums up this album, bad, meaning this album sucks.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This deluxe DVD packaging of Disney's incomparably magical ALICE is loaded with extras.  It does not, however, have all of the material available on the deluxe Laserdisc issue of several years back, which was packed with a lot of video and audio extras.  I believe the same video extras are all here plus a few new items, but the audio extras are considerably less than on the Laserdisc version.  Still, great fun and lots to see and listen to, including some great historical features.  Grab this before it disappears.  ALICE has always been underrated by critics, but it's long been a favorite of mine and many others.
B000002H6C|3.0|this album is pretty good and is heavy, but my complaint is some of the songs are to long and drag.
B00005JKHP|3.0|To be fair, this is not a horrible film. In fact, while the original theatrical edition did have it's flaws -it was cold, and emotionaless, this DVD &quot;director's cut&quot; helps establish why the film only worked part of the time. Robert Wise, with 20 plus years behind him, can now look back and see his film in a different light. But, no matter what tweaking you do, you still cannot change the story, which was bland and done before. The script is weak in many area's, but that weakness could've been overlooked had the producers tried to keep the chemistry between Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly going, just like the TV series. Trek has proven that when your charatcers are more 3-dimensional, the silly story works. In The Motion Picture though, the characters are treated like estranged relatives. Had they taken the essance of the roles, as was done in Trek II, and made them what they were -friends -this movie would've worked better. The new version is slightly better, as Wise has had a chance to &quot;finish&quot; his film. Caught between the success of Star Wars and Paramount's aborted 4th network attempt, The Motion Picture was fast tracked to get it ready for Christmas 1979. The thing was, the script was mess, the director had not worked on such a heavy effects ladden film before and the visual effects themselves were untested. Mix these altogether, and you got what you got. The new DVD offers us some &quot;enhanced&quot;, CGI effects. Wise gives us a detailed reason in the commentary track, on how and why these effects were added. He also goes into great detail on the point of the story, which he admits was one of the films flaws. It's brave when a director can go back and see and tell where his film went off the tracks. The film is still a snoozer, but I've always had a soft spot for this film. I don't mind the endless scenes of V'jer and the great amounts of no dialogue that goes with those scenes. Wise has almost saved his own film. And for that, I recommend this film.
B000000OAA|5.0|After already putting out two amazing cds, queen came through with another gem with their third album sheer heart attack.

0385504209|4.0|I must be one of the last people on the planet to read this book.  It's everywhere.  So here goes...<br />This is a masterfully written thriller, truly a 'can't put it down, stay up all night, page-turner' (I read it one day).  The fact that it delves into secret societies and the sacred feminine reveals that we just love that stuff.  Crafting it into a murder mystery is a stroke of mastery.<br />It's obvious the author has done his homework.  There's a reason he has turned it into a fiction book rather than writing non-fiction.  Fiction gives him room to express his point of view without stating it as fact.  Granted, he has done his research and his facts are easily verifiable; however, his conclusions, if written into a non-fiction account, would probably render him a conspiracy theorist.  This stuff is not revelatory, nor is it new.  It may be new and shocking to most but that's only because most people don't read the dry, scholarly texts (i.e. non-fiction) where this research is found.<br />Holy Blood, Holy Grail (mentioned in the book) will hit the bestseller list again because of this book.  Umberto Eco's works should also gain credence (even though not mentioned in the book).  I read Holy Blood, Holy Grail years ago and it all came rushing back while reading this book.<br />The sacred feminine, the power mongering of the early church, the 'other' New Testament and the 'lost writings of the true Christian church' and all the other ideas have been covered (cf. Bart Ehrman and Elaine Pagels, currently both on the bestseller lists with similar lines of reasoning).  It's been argued back and forth for a long, long time.  And it will probably continue to be so.<br />Mr. Brown did not unearth some hitherto unknown texts that reveals this stuff.  It's already out there and he is quite literally walking on the shoulders of giants.  It's fun to conjecture but do your homework before espousing this stuff as truth.<br />This isn't to take the fun out of the book.  What is clever is how he has taken such a breadth of knowledge and crafted it into a composite whole.  If you like codes and word games, car chases and intrigue, spiritual and religious possibility, this is definitely a surefire bet.  This book is really enjoyable - as fiction.  It's definitely a must read.  It's a lot of fun and exciting to see what he does with his material; just don't expect too much depth.What is clever is how he has taken such a breadth of knowledge and crafted it into a composite whole.

B00012QM8G|5.0|I had to watch this film for school, I was very young and I didn't understand everything that happened in the film, but it had a profound impact on me. It is a very sad story but I definetly think all ages/races should see this film so something like this will never happen again.
0440238609|2.0|So God is the bad guy. Not man. Not Satan. God's the bad guy. He needs to be overthrown so mankind can experience \\"pleasure\\" and \\"freedom\\" (without guilt I guess). And our buddies, The Fallen Angels, are really the good guys. See, they've been looking out for us all these millenia. Every bit of pleasure and self-will has had to be wrestled away from God by the denizens of hell. Because they care so much about us. Whew...I wish I was joking. So let's see...God CREATED the universe but if we disgruntled ingrates collect a few magic goodies we can overthrow Him and do things the way we like? In what universe does that even sound like a plausible storyline??? <br />At first I tried to ignore the ridiculous premise behind these books because Pullman weaves an intriguing tale. But after 2 books I just couldn't stand how absurd and offensive this premise is. Maybe Pullman \\"pulls\\" something out of the air at the end to try to staunch the bleeding, but I wasn't about to hang around to find out.<br />And the thought of children reading this anti-religious propaganda made me cringe. These books are not for children. I could not believe I found them in the Juvenile section of the library. Not even young adult...juvenile. Much of the subject matter is definitely not appropriate for children. I guess the publishers knew this would never fly as an adult fantasy. And it's a shame, because Mr. Pullman really is very talented. <br />Absurd, offensive and not for kids.
B00004VVN9|5.0|Before virtual reality and before &quot;The Matrix,&quot; there was the 1983 film &quot;Brainstorm.&quot; O.K., this movie may not compare favorably with &quot;The Matrix,&quot; but it does involve some of the same tangential themes that that film deals with. The comparisons with virtual reality are apt, though viewers tend to overlook this aspect of the movie. People usually associate the film, if they even talk about it today, with Natalie Wood. The actress died shortly before the film wrapped in a highly publicized boating accident, thereby cutting short a lengthy film career and giving this motion picture a stigma it still carries today. A viewing of &quot;Brainstorm&quot; shows the film is more than Natalie Wood; it is a compelling story about innovative technology and its potential for misuse by powerful forces. Not a particularly unique movie plot, to be sure, but &quot;Brainstorm&quot; is still an intriguing film largely due to its solid cast and amazing special effects. The movie holds up well twenty years after its conception, which is saying a lot considering how far film effects have come during that time.<br />A team of brilliant scientists headed up by Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher) and Michael Brace (Christopher Walken) have finally made an enormous breakthrough in their research. After years of frustrating tests and wrangles over budgetary concerns, an amazing new virtual reality system has been born. The machines these scientists created can record the sensory perceptions of one human being and replay them for another person. Reynolds and her team can capture everything--sight, taste, touch, hearing, smell, even emotion--and record it on tape. The implications of this discovery should become apparent almost immediately. Communications, entertainment, medicine: every aspect of human endeavor will irrevocably change once this device hits the marketplace. Of course, a few other shadier applications also apply with the device, particularly military systems and mind control. Reynolds, Brace, and Brace's estranged wife Karen soon find themselves at loggerheads with the boss of the company funding the research, the sympathetic yet uncompromising Alex Terson (Cliff Robertson). The United States military leans heavily on Terson concerning the project's development, threatening to remove funding if Reynolds denies the wonks at the Pentagon access to her research.<br />Running throughout these titanic battles about the ethics of a virtual reality system and the increasingly authoritarian tactics taken by the military is the relationship between Michael and Karen Brace. The couple split up over Michael's inability to balance his work with his personal life, a fact that Karen resents since her husband has neglected her and their son. Moreover, there is some sort of vaguely hinted at relationship between Reynolds and Michael Brace, a relationship that should hardly come as a surprise since the two have worked so closely together over the past decade or so. When Lillian Reynolds, a rabid chain smoker, records her death from a massive heart attack as it happens, Brace becomes fascinated with exploring this amazing death sequence caught on tape. The government decides Michael is too unstable to continue working on the project, thus banning him from the building and removing his security clearance from the company computers. When you muck around with a genius, however, you must make sure you have all the angles covered. Brace enlists the help of his tech savvy wife and a few other friends from the company and hacks into the company's mainframe in order to access the tape. What follows is an amazing special effects odyssey of sight and sound as Brace learns what happens when we die. In the process of playing the tape and risking his own life, Michael and Karen heal their problematic relationship.<br />The best elements in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; are the outstanding performances from the cast fused with amazing special effects. Natalie Wood, although somewhat wasted in a smaller role, stops the heart every time she appears on screen with her amazing beauty and solid acting. Christopher Walken does what Christopher Walken does best: act slightly weird by alternating between subdued silence and loud rage. Cliff Robertson and Louise Fletcher both excel in their respective roles, especially Fletcher, who as the temperamental Lillian Reynolds is both believable and amusing. Check out the scene when she dies from her heart attack yet takes the time to attach herself to her wondrous recording device. This is, I think, exactly what a true scientist dedicated to exploring every mystery would do in a similar circumstance. As good a job as the actors do, the special effects sometimes eclipse them. Apparently, the guy in charge of this film worked on Kubrick's &quot;2001,&quot; and boy does it show. The final scenes in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; evoke memories of Keir Dullea's psychedelic trip at the end of &quot;2001,&quot; except here they look better. It would be a great experience to see this film in a movie theater.<br />&quot;Brainstorm&quot; is a beautiful, thought provoking film I never tire of watching. The scenes between Walken and Wood are wonderful, especially when they use the reality device for their own personal explorations. In this way, the movie moves beyond a mere science fiction potboiler into realms of romance and psychological drama. Sadly, the DVD edition lacks the sort of extras a film of this caliber deserves. You would think a film this prescient would inspire the folks at Warner to pull out all the stops for the disc release. Well, anyone remotely familiar with Warner DVDs knows the company couldn't give a darn about what their discs contain. Too bad. I will still watch &quot;Brainstorm&quot; from time to time, but I secretly yearn for a special edition release in the near future--one with a commentary from Fletcher and Walken at the very least, along with some notes about the special effects in the film.

B00005YW4H|4.0|i got this CD for my birthday- how i wanted it so BAD!!<br /> overall, the cd was pretty good. i gave it four stars because<br /> i thought some of the songs were pretty, boring, like <br /> nightingale. We're not kids, no need to listen to any lullaby <br /> songs.<br /> her voice is quiet, yet strong. (^^ if you know what i mean)<br /> i recommend this cd for anyone who loves soft voice and mild <br /> jazz!<br /> personally, i love this cd.
B000084T18|1.0|I used to think Oops I Did It Again, Bye Bye Bye and Always On Time were bad and annoying but compared to this &quot;Music&quot; the songs and artists I just mentioned are classics! 50 Cents is so monotone even ma$e has more character in his rhymes. So what if hes from the hood? At leased keep a positive message for those still tryin to make it. All this album does is keep the hoods violent. Do we really need more violence in the streets?
B00008BXJF|5.0|My first reaction after hearing this for the first time was, &quot;Yes, King Crimson have finally done it!&quot; There have always been certain songs by King Crimson that I have liked and thought were masterpieces, but their albums always seemed so uneven, with a great song followed by an experiment that didn't work, or something that sounded pretty standard and boring. Their albums always seemed to suffer from a lack of focus. &quot;Thrak&quot; was a very good example of this; the songs I didn't like on that album compromized all the good ones (I also didn't much care for the Beatles tone). This one is consistently tight and focused throughout, with a very original, dark sound. All the instumentals are amazing. The only time I start to get a little irritated is when Adrian Belew starts singing. Part of the reason I think I like this album so much is that he doesn't sing very much. I always found KC's lyrics and singing to be their weak point-- they were always pretty annoying (as in their classic &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;-- a great song musically, but those lyrics drive me nuts). This album approaches metal at times, too, which is never a bad thing. The ideas are well developed and mature; they take their time to build the tension, and all the experiments hit the mark, without a flat moment.
B000092T6M|5.0|This is simply put one of the greatest movies ever made, as far as I'm concerned. I do not really care who made it and where it comes from. Ok, I'm really fed up with hollywood with all the crap they're putting out but this one shines through. It is wonderfully filmed in UK with all the castle scenes and landscapes. There's really nothing to complain about, everything fits nicely from beginning to an end and there could be a sequel to this, it would be wonderful. This movie is awesome and deserves nothing less than 5 stars. I've seen it hundred times and it never gets boring. A masterpiece that it is.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I saw this movie with a friend of mine, and throughout the whole screening, we were screaming our heads off. We walked out of the movie theatre shivering and giggling at the same time. Gothika was an awesome movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Its very interesting to see how the whole plot unravels and what Halle Berry will do to survive. Personally, I cant wait for the movie to come out on DVD so that I can watch this again. My firned and I have labeled this as the best scary movie ever.
B0001AP12G|3.0|kanye west very well may be the one artist that can merge the underground, conscious hip hop with the commercialized, glitzy facets of rap.  the college dropout is his first attempt at doing so.  personally, i like his content level, in that many people can relate to his rhymes (working at the gap, black people being profiled, etc.).  <br />however...the album to me either is a song or a skit...and kind of loses its energy during the middle, with questionable tracks such as &quot;the workout plan&quot; and &quot;breathe in, breathe out.&quot;  thankfully, &quot;we don't care&quot;, &quot;spaceship&quot;, &quot;never let me down&quot;, &quot;get 'em high&quot;, &quot;two words&quot;, &quot;through the wire&quot;, &quot;family business&quot;, and &quot;last call&quot; are either solid or exceptional enough to hold the album up.
B0000931QR|5.0|She has a talent and she's not afraid to show it to the world! I love this cd! It is without a doubt increible! Me encanta! Her spectacular voice and the outrageous notes from the band are united in a one in a lifetime sound! You can't find a better singer with better lyrics or even better music. My favorite track on this album is number 3, rosas.There are many nights that I,With this enchanting song, sleep wonderfully. Anyone who doesn't like this Spanish wonder just doesn't like this type of music fore it is the best of it's kind. And if you are a returning fan of hers, then you will surely be pleased. I promise you the best.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Unplugged is Alanis at her best. The more I listened to it the more I liked it. I was used to some of the songs sounding different from the studio recordings of them, but I quickly grew to love how she arranged and sung them on this album much more.<BR>One exception is &quot;You oughta know&quot;, the original version is filled with more energy and raw emotion.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones has produced a great follow-up to her first hit CD.  Just sit back while driving your car and enjoy.  My favorite selection is &quot;Don't Miss You at All&quot;.  Norah adds great lyrics to Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot;.  Norah's voice is pure velvet fog, she entertains you, relaxes you and takes you to place where you can be alone with her world of music.

0385510438|1.0|I had really been looking forward to this book, expecting (and hoping for) a return to the great legal thrillers that made me a John Grisham fan.  Unfortunately, this book wasn't what I expected at all.  The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's.  Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation.  The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot.  They help to explain the town and the people living there and it provides some action to keep the plot moving, but don't expect to be surpised at the ending.<br />All in all, it wasn't a bad book if you're looking for a story about a small southern town, but if you're looking for a good legal thriller, this isn't it.
B0000CNY27|4.0|The Kurt Russell/John Carpenter commentary is from the 1994 Laserdisc special edition of EFNY.  The commentary by production designer Joe Alves and producer Debra Hill is new.  The deleted scene (a bank robbery, or rather the exit from the bank robbery) would have seemed awkward and out of place and tone had it stayed in the final cut, so its just as well it was cut out.<br />The video transfer is superior to the previous DVD release of this film.  But the amount of bonus features in this Special Edition release does not seem large enough to merit a second disc.  I bet they could have fit it all on one disc.<br />But that's marketing for you - something about a 2-disc Special Edition sounds cooler than a 1-disc SE.<br />I'm kind of up in the air about whether purchasing this 2-disc SE to replace my earlier DVD copy of EFNY was worth it.  But even if the extras seem too few in number (even with the inclusion of a comic book), it is nice to get a version with this considerably sharper picture and sound.

0060528737|4.0|Even though I am not the target audience for this book (I'm an adult) I was still on the edge of my seat, hoping that Sam and Lirael would make it in time to save Nicholas from Hedge and the evil powers he was about to unleash. That being said, I must admit that I was slightly disappointed in the ending because I felt that it was almost an anti-climax. Of course Lirael (along with her half-sister, Sabariel, and nephew Sam) saves the day, but Nix simply uses an epilogue to wrap up all the loose ends that are hanging out. In my opinion it doesn't answer any of our questions: Where will Sabriel go now? How badly were she and Sam hurt? What kind of life will she have with Sabriel; will they have any kind of relationship at all?<BR> Perhaps Nix intended for us to ask these questions (clearly life itself doesn't answer them freely) but it makes me wonder if he intends/ed to continue writing about Lirael. The first book of the trilogy, Sabriel, stands on its own as a novel. The second book, Lirael, is completely dependant on this one to finish up the story. I have the three books in one volume and it is clear that Sabriel's story is separate, although linked, to that of Lirael. <BR>This trilogy is an excellent one for girls and women of all ages, particularly for those who might be interested in Tolkien but are perhaps not ready for or interested in the often overwhelming fight scenes. This story focuses more on the magic abilities and the strength of its female protagonists, almost to the point of making the main male character (Sam) into a whimpering idiot. Full marks to a male author for giving us great female characters in an often male-dominated genre.

078681859X|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is a book that most authors can only dream of writing.  Jonathon Stroud has definately out done hisself with this new and intriguing novel of murder, mystery, and magic.  The young apprentice, Nathaniel is an inexperienced magician.  He knows much about demons and imps, but this knowledge is kept a secret.  By summoning Bartimaeus (a powerful djinni), Nathaniel has him under his control and he is commanded to do some heavy duty work.<BR>It is alomst unbearable waiting for the next two books in the series to be published.  I guarantee that is you read this book, you'll fall under a spell that binds you to the next books.
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce Knowles has undoubtedly had the most success as a solo artist as opposed to her Destinys Child counterparts Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland, with a selection of huge chart hits, a number one album, and one of the best selling singles of 2003 (the incredible Crazy In Love). Beyonce also starred in hit movie 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' as Foxy Cleopatra, and even launched her own movie, entitled 'The Fighting Temptations'. So 'Dangerously In Love' is her first solo album, and suprisingly she is the final member of Destinys Child to release as solo album, so has the wait be worthwhile?<br />With an all star cast featuring in various songs (Big Boi and Sleepy Brown, Sean Paul, Jay-Z, Luther Vandross and Missy Elliot to name a few) things were certainly looking promising. Kicking the album off with the faboulous 'Crazy In Love' was certainly a smart move, and following song 'Naughty Girl' is equally as sexy and raunchy. 'Baby Boy' was the second single to be lifted from the album, and that in itself is a great reggae dance floor filler. 'Hip Hop Star' is also another standout, with a slick R&B beat and a nice contribution from Outkast member Big Boi. But from here on, this is where things rapdily go downhill.<br />After a promising start to the album, in comparison the rest is atrocious. 'Be With You', 'Me, Myself and I' and 'Yes' are all tuneless, have paint by number lyrics, and all suffer from sounding far too samey and being boring R&B slush, 'Speechless' is even worse, as it crams all three tunes mentioned above into a five minute bore, and by the time penultimate track 'Gift From Virgo' rolls out it feels like the same track has been carbon copied with different lyrics about six times. I mean, please, a bit of diversity wouldn't go a miss.<br />In fairness, 'Dangerously In Love 2' is a belting remake of the Destinys Child classic, 'Signs' offers something a little different and is a unusual concept, and on closing track 'Daddy' Beyonce actually shows areasonable amount of passion and emotion to produce a very personal climax. 'Thats How You Like It' is also fairly decent, as Beyonce collaborates with Jay-Z again, and 'The Closer I Get To You' is passable.<br />So overall, does this come recommended? Unless you are a die hard Beyonce fan, no. There is a reasonable amount of good tracks, although none of them quite live up to the genious of 'Crazy In Love', but the main problem with this album is there really is a ridicolous amount of slushy ballad drivel, which serves as nothing more than to fill up the track list. This one is definately only for those who are huge fans of Beyonce.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|The title seemed to be the best in this movie, they showed Tokyo very nice but I did not want to watch any quide. The whole story very poor and disappointing and very far away from a comedy. Nothing could really make you laugh in the movie and nobody seemed happy. It would be ok if that was an award for a quide to Japan as a documetary.
B00018D44U|5.0|This album took a few listens for it to grow on me as did &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and I ended up loving both. Norah's music is not like the made for radio songs that are suppose to hook you the first music, so some people judge it negatively based on the first couple listens.<br />&quot;Feels like Home&quot; is a more complete blend of musical styles than &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. There are country-tinged songs, like &quot;Creepin' In&quot;, &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot;, that are not too country for you non-country fans. Blues tunes such as &quot;What Am I To You?&quot; and &quot;In The Morning&quot; get your feet tapping and the gorgeous &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; and touching &quot;Don't Miss You at All&quot; (a song where Norah combined her own lyrics with Duke Ellington's music) contain the jazz elements of her debut. Then there are songs that are simply Norah and can't be categorized such as &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;.<br />I'm sure it took a while for the first album to grow on some of you and you ended up loving it, so don't mind the negative reviews. This one's another classic.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be.<br /><br />Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them.<br /><br />The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.<br /><br />And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.<br />Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.<br /><br />The one star is purely for Kate Beckinsdale in a leather outfit.<br /><br />I have the DTS Region 3 edition of this movie. It has a great DTS soundtrack (wow, now can really appreciate the mind-numbingly loud sound effects and awful music). And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super. But no matter how good looking it is, Underworld is still terrible.he mind-numbingly loud sound effects and awful music). And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super.

B00004Z459|5.0|Man, I was blown away! Every song is an ASS-Kicker! !!There's no such thing as a bad song on this whole album. I don't know what those other reviewers with 1 or 2 stars were thinking. But at least the ones who gave 5 were right on. This band can't do anything wrong!! They straight out rock, you can't find another group who can mix Rap, Heavy Metal, Techno, and Pop better than they can! They're the new sound of the Millenium!! Not only that, they're songs mean something, anyone can relate to their problems mentioned in their powerful rhymes. 'Papercut' can relate to a headache or stress, 'Crawling' can relate to serious fear you feel, '1step closer' can be about common family problems,  ect. Chester and Shinoda don't even cuss. These guys should be music's best influence on kids and teens today!
0316666343|1.0|The book started out very good but then became boring. I was hoping the family would keep searching and bring Susie's killer to justice or at least find out who killed her and where her body was. The book seemed to be heading in that direction but then it stopped and got involved in silly subplots that were dull like her little sister's romance with a boy, her mother's romance with a sheriff that was SUPPOSED to be working on Susie's case and a dumb girl who suddenly becomes obsessed with death and Susie upon learning of Susie's demise. It gets worse as the book goes on. Susie herself decides her murder's fate and the fate she chooses for him is what he deserved but it is unbelieveable. Death by icicles and what good does it do for the story to make Susie a killer herself? Just awful. Worse of all is the chapter where Susie returns to earth borrowing a girl's body. She has sex with some boy who had a crush on her and then goes back to heaven. She never thinks of her family or thinks to tell her family who killed her or where her body is. And also, with Susie having being raped, I don't think she would want to come back to earth for sex,lol. The only part of the book that is good is the first chapter. It all leads nowhere.
0385504209|4.0|This barnburner of a page-turner is irresistible and fun if you remember that it is fiction, spiced with a few grains of truth and conjecture.  I also suspect that Brown wrote it with tongue firmly in cheek.  The protagonist Professor of Symbology (what the heck is that?) lectures to his students in a classroom situation that will have religion and art history students rolling in the aisles. He refers to Leonardo as &quot;Da Vinci&quot;--something no art professor ever does, and Brown undoubtedly knows it because his wife is an art historian.  On the serious side, Brown effectively uses his storytelling talents to expose readers to ambiguities in &quot;truths&quot; that many Christians take for granted--any why not?  It's good to make people think.<br />If you don't think it will spoil your enjoyment of the book, read Chicago Art Institue curator Bruce Boucher's article about the Da Vinci Code in the New York Times (&quot;Does the Da Vinci Code Crack Leonardo?&quot;, 8/3/2003) or the review in the National Catholic Reporter (10/3/2003) written by Father Andrew Greeley a not-too-shabby writer of page-turners himself, who states that the bizarre and powerful secret society Opus Dei &quot;would have a hard time conspiring themselves out of a wet paper bag.&quot;<br />A cheesy, fun book that will make a long airplane flight go down like a plate of French brie, crackers, and fresh figs.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Bill Murray maintains our (middle-aged American male) interest only by looking poised to mug for the camera; why 23-ish Scarlett would be attracted is puzzling.  Murray as an ex-action hero is also problematic. Bruce Willis would have been perfect: there's even a guest shot on Japanese TV that matches his scene on the cruise liner with Chris Tucker.  In the making-of documentary Sofia says she only considered Murray, so draw your own conclusions.<BR>The film's sight and sound suggest sinus-related hearing loss as much as the jet lag and insomnia oft-mentioned.  But the filmmakers say they suffered this symptoms as well, so one must yield to cinema verite.<BR>Although Murray's bed scene describing his life and family is a stunner, follow his character's lead by watching &quot;La Dolce Vita.&quot; Marcello is matchless, and the interview with Sofia Coppola and Murray was filmed in Rome, but what is Coppola's point?
0385504209|5.0|This book was truly amazing, no wonder it is a best-seller.  I found my self turning pages hours on end.  I could not put the darn thing down.  The short chapters left you at a cliffhanger each time and made you want to read more.<br />Even if you cannot enjoy the book for its historical views then you could enjoy the book as a thriller.  Not since Harry Potter have I been able to read like this.  Truly a remarkable piece of work.  Although their will be some out there who do not enjoy it for its content, mainly about the Holy Grail part, they should at least be able to enjoy it for its page turning excitement.<br />The Da Vinci Code = Hours of non-stop reading fun.

Like working a job that aint paying right, or leaving school and the pressures that come with it if you make that decision. He doesn't have a celebrity persona but he definitely has star quality. I feel like if I seen him on the street I could say &quot;Like ya album&quot; and he would humbly say thank you. It's hip=hop. It's balanced.I love it. DON'T BURN IT........BUY IT....
B00005JME0|4.0|I saw this movie yesterday, thinking I could just slot it in with the rest of the slightly dumb teen movies out there. (Can i help it if I enjoy some of those movies?)But the butterfly effect suprised me by being smart, quirky, and overall pretty 'effective'.<br />It was a lot of fun watching Kutcher's character mess around with time, and seeing how one action can change the lives of so many people.<br />There were some nonsensical loopholes in the film, which i'll refrain from going into- I don't want to spoil anything, but overall it was pretty tight and a lot of fun to watch.<br />*BONUS* if you're an Ashton Kutcher fan, he's a pretty big cutie in this movie!!!<br />I recommend it!
0385504209|3.0|This book was definitely a page-turner -- I stayed up until 4am finishing it.  And while it does read like a made-for-tv movie the problem I had with it was Dan Brown's disturbing method of combining actual historical fact with made-up historical facts so it is difficult to discern which is which.  Even more misleading is the note at the beginning of the book stating that &quot;All discriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.&quot; Unfortunately, this does not hold true for the &quot;history&quot; Dan Brown purports to tell as backstory to his modern day mystery.<br />For example, around chapter 55 two of the main characters give the third main character a quick &quot;history&quot; lesson in Christianity and the holy grail.  Many of the historical facts they describe are known facts.  But many are not.  For example, in attempting to draw parallels between the ancient Greek god Mithras and Jesus, one character states that Mithras was called &quot;The Son of God&quot; and the &quot;Light of the World.&quot;  Unfortunately, there is absolutely no historical basis for such an assertion because Mithras was a god who was worshipped in mystery cults.  There are no surviving writings about Mithras and we have no idea *what* he might have been called. The book also describes all early Christians as having believed Jesus was mortal, beliefs which were later suppressed by Constantine.  The history of the early church is too great to get into detail here, but suffice it to say that early Christians' beliefs ranged from believing that the Christ was fully human, to fully divine, to fully divine within a human body.<br />I don't have any grievances with Dan Brown's story (definitely a page-turner), or his take on Christian history.  I do, however, think it is extremely dangerous to mix fabricated &quot;facts&quot; with actual historical facts.  I had a hard time keeping them separate, and I've actually had the opportunity to research some of the topics Brown touched upon.<br />Historical fiction can really be fun because you have the opportunity to learn something while reading about a terrific mystery (that actually gets solved!).  In this case, though, I had a difficult time enjoying the story because of the glaring mistruths Brown tells along the way.  Thus, as an exciting introduction to the mystery of early (and late) Christian figures, Da Vinci's paintings, and the sangreal, this book is pretty good.  As &quot;historical&quot; fiction, it sucks.<br />Incidentally, Brown does mention at the beginning of Chapter 60 the titles of some very well researched books on the topic of Mary Magdalene and the holy grail.arch some of the topics Brown touched upon. <br />Historical fiction can really be fun because you have the opportunity to learn something while reading about a terrific mystery (that actually gets solved!).

0385510438|2.0|I have been increasingly disappointed in John Grisham's work over the last several years, and this book was no exception.  After reading the book description, I thoroughly expected a murder/mystery/thriller story line.  Though Grisham's story begins with a bang, the book loses heart in the middle and drags the reader down with a &quot;historical biography&quot; feel.  For those expecting to read about Danny Padgitt and his vow of retribution, Grisham focuses more on the life of Willy Traynor and the Clanton community in the South during the 1970s.  Of course, since Grisham is a master of legal proceedings, the trial of Danny Padgitt consumes Part I of the book, and he is finally sentenced to prison on Page 168.  Danny Padgitt is not paroled and released until Page 291 and the book ends on Page 355!  Just as Grisham begins to hit his stride and captivate the reader, the book comes to a startling end.  If you are looking for a murder/mystery/thriller book, please try Patricia Cornwell.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is one of those movies that I love to watch over and over again.  There's just something about the movie that draws me to it.  The acting, for the most part, is laughable.  Leslie Nielsen--back when he was still doing serious roles (how old is that guy?)--is particularly funny when trying to look his most serious.  Just check out the expression on Nielsen's face when Morbius tells Nielsen of his premonition of death.  You also have a young Richard &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; Anderson as the chief engineer and an equally youthful Earl &quot;Police Woman&quot; Holliman as the burbon-guzzling cook.  <br />Walter Pigeon, in the role of Dr. Edward Morbius, a marooned scientist who has developed a god complex, is probably the only actor who plays his character to a high level of credibility.  Rounding out the major players is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira, Morbius's &quot;come hither&quot; daughter.<br />Francis, too, gave me cause to laugh in this movie.  She starts out as a 20-something, naive nature lover who's never kissed a man and, in the space of a couple of days, turns into a deliberately passionate woman who throws herself into the arms of Neilsen and spouts off lines like: &quot;I'm ready to go with you, darling.&quot;  Pretty funny stuff.<br />Now, I don't want you to think I'm trying to trash the movie.  The story is excellent, although it was regarded as being too cerebral at the time of its release (with it's talk of &quot;the Id&quot;).  Mindful of their viewing audience at the drive-ins of the day, moviemakers eventually placed emphasis on Robbie the Robot--Morbius's mechanical helper who can balance ten tons of metal shielding in the palm of one hand (and not tip over or sink into the ground!).<br />The story isn't all that complicated.  A ship is sent to check on another ship that landed on the planet Altair 4 years earlier.  They arrive to find everybody dead except Morbius and his daughter.  Nielsen wants to evacuate the two, but Morbius has found the remnants of an now-perished civilization called the Krell and doesn't want to leave.  Using their technology, he is able to harness the power of the mind and create anything from the nothing with a mere thought.  But there's one problem--everybody has dreams and nighmares when they sleep.  Hence, the cause of the demise of the Krell.  <br />I won't give away the ending--I've probably given away too much already.  The movie's special effects were considered cutting-edge at the time and hold up surprisingly well.  And Robbie was probably the forerunner of robot designs to come for the next decade or so.  Amusingly, you can find set pieces, and even the uniforms the crew wears, being used in quite few other movies of the period.<br />Overall, highly recommended.
0792164903|4.0|Sleepy Hollow was a delightful version by Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is Incabob Crane, and i must say a very funny version of him. I didnt find the movie to be terrible scary, more of a movie to enjoy for the little jumps and humor, along with the handsome Johnny! In the movie the the story is a little different, such as how the headless horseman came to be and that he can go anywhere not just staying on the one side of the bridge. I highly recommend the movie for ATLEAST a one time viewing!<br />I ALSO RECOMMEND EDWARD SCISSORHANDS!!
6305350205|2.0|What a ghastly Trek movie.  Despite some of the special effects, this movie looks like it was done on a very conservative budget.  Once again, you have a minimum-manned U.S.S. Enterprise being sent in to save the day.  <br />This time, they are dispatched to the Planet of Peace (can't remember the real name of it) to deal with a hostage crisis.  Upon arriving, the Enterprise crew discovers a rebellion has been fomented by by Spock's half-brother, Sybok, played by Laurence Luckinbill.  Anywho, he and his rag-tag band of explorers end of taking over the Enterprise (with minimal resistance) after Sybok does some sort of pseudo mind meld to help each bridge crew member &quot;release his pain.&quot;<br />It's simple-minded ideas like that which drive down the credibility rating for this movie.  C'mon, guys!  Then you have the Enterprise breaching the &quot;Great Barrier&quot; at the center of the galaxy.  Folks, I don't want to quibble about this, but the center of our galaxy is approximately 50,000 light years away.  First, you have Kirk climbing El Capitan, then hot-footing it over to the center of the galaxy as if it were a short stroll.  Voyager was 'thrown' 60,000 light years and it took them seven years to get back to Earth (only by virture of some outside help did it not take the expected 50 years).  So, this one really pushes the Star Trek world envelope.<br />You have a lot of wasteland scenes...something that Trek movies, unfortunately, have a penchant for.<br />The acting is so-so, the story nonsense, and the special effects unspectacular.  Overall, Ebert was right--this is probably the worst of the Trek movies.<br />They're lucky I didn't rate it any worse.
0671027344|5.0|This is now my new favorite book. It was a simply wonderful book to read, and I loved how the author writes to you in a form of letters from Charlie the main character. This book opens people up to the truth of high school. It includes many topics that teenagers deal with daily. Some people might hate the book for its certain view points, on gays and rape etc. But all of that stuff is out there in the world, and you would be lying to yourself if you think it isn't. But thats not the point of the book. The message is so wonderful and clear to the reader, telling you to be yourself, and do things that you want to do. It really gave me strength, and a feeling that I can be myself, in this world. I throughly enjoyed it and I'm sure all high school students will.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I've always liked Britany, but this album doesn't show off her talent. You can't even make out her words. Britany was showcased fine before. Now she's branching out. She should at least make sure her lyrics are clear enough to understand. She has talent but she's trying to be fresh again like her friend Madonna's probably mentioned to her. Only she's forgeting the basics of selling her work. Though I never liked Madonna's vanity videos, you could always make out her words. In case anyone's offended my earing was checked for perfect recently. I still like her performances just not this.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This right here man, is the greatest record to ever drop, kanye holds it down for Chi Town, big up. Putting mos, kweli and jigga on the album is killer man, it reminds of the golden days of rapping, the good times, you know when you could put a tape on and just bounce. To all of you who hate this album and don't believe in kanye, you are not a fan of TRUE hiphop.
B000002KXO|4.0|&quot;Mirage&quot; was the first album after &quot;Tusk&quot; for Fleetwod Mac. With &quot;Mirage&quot;, they seemed to revoke the experimental, art-nouveau feel of &quot;Tusk&quot;, and move back toward the lighter, pop-rock sound prevalent on &quot;Rumours&quot; and &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;. Keep in mind that this album was released and created amid the launching of several solo careers within the group, and that alone gives the album far more merit than it usually gets. &quot;Mirage&quot; has a few better known songs on it, including &quot;Love in Store&quot;, &quot;Hold Me&quot;, and one of the best-known Fleetwood Mac songs to date, &quot;Gypsy&quot;. A few tracks continue to have an experimental effect, especially &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; and &quot;Empire State&quot; (Which kind of reminds me of &quot;Family Man&quot;). I would say that this album is worth owning for &quot;Gypsy&quot; alone. The lyrics on &quot;Mirage&quot; tend to be slightly more superficial than on past or future albums, but it's still a great listen. My only complaint, though, is that the covers have been cut. The photo on the back has been cropped to make way for a track list (It's fully printed on the inside, though), and the original liner notes have been completely obliterated without any real compensation. Cropped covers, though, are merely a superficial wound, and &quot;Mirage&quot; is no album any Fleetwood Mac fan should be without.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Firstly....it IS The Beatles,so you know the music is good. But once you start re-arranging the songs from the &quot;classic&quot; pattern,things tend to become &quot;another mix tape&quot;. The &quot;Let It Be&quot;/&quot;Get Back&quot; sessions have always been an interesting time for Beatles music,and this album shows them trying their new ideas out. BUT,this new version actually removes part of the original Beatles plan ( to take the listener into the studio with them ),by deleting all the &quot;fooling around&quot; bits. Now it sounds like a studio album with less Phil Spector overdubs.( And frankly,this album would've been more &quot;naked&quot;,if I hadn't heard these version on the &quot;Anthology&quot; video.) I've noticed also a few things:<br />1) Every song is SHORTER than the original release.(This includes the non-overdubbed songs too.)<br />2) If this album is supposed to be as The Beatles originally intended...where is the song &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; ? ( They managed to put it on Anthology 3... ). <br />3) The &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; disc.,besides being no more exciting than any of the bootleg albums of this session...contains different versions of &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; &amp; &quot;Dig It&quot;. It also includes &quot;Child Of Nature&quot; ( John's original take on &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; ),and several unreleased songs.....but in snippets...so you feel genuinely teased.<br />I've given this album 4 stars for the music alone,but to tell the truth,if you took your &quot;Anthology 3&quot;,and the original &quot;Let It Be&quot;,you could make your own mix and feel just as &quot;naked&quot;.
B000002KKC|4.0|It's not pop, it's not rock, it's... Tusk? It's definitely nothing like what Fleetwood Mac had recorded previously or has recorded since. This is the one album where you can see Fleetwood Mac go outside the usual pop-rock template. What it lacks is normalcy. What it gains is brilliance. Tusk showcases some fascinatingly weird Lindsey Buckingham tracks (&quot;The Ledge&quot;, &quot;Not That Funny&quot;), among them the title track, &quot;Tusk&quot;. Without a doubt &quot;Tusk&quot; is one of the strangest, but best songs I have ever heard, with a marching band, spoken lyrics, and background voice (some of you might remember the live version on &quot;The Dance&quot;, keep in mind that the original is not too similar). Christine McVie contributes several songs that are as good or better than usual, including the album's opener, &quot;Over &amp; Over&quot;. The album is also the source of a few Stevie Nicks favorites, &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Storms&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; (one of my favorite Nicks songs), and &quot;Sara&quot;. One endless point of dispute regarding this release of the album has been the edited version of &quot;Sara&quot;. I agree, once you're used to the original, you're never quite the same listening to the edit. Don't let that stop you, though! The rest of the album is such an amazing artwork that it is worth buying despite the flaw. Another small flaw is on the cover. It is an endless source of both fascination and frustration why there apparently is always some need to mar album covers with advertising. This one happens to have &quot;2- Record Set on 1 Specially Priced Disc&quot; written toward the bottom of the cover. The extra ad campaign does not detract signifigantly from the album, and I maintain that it's definitely worth buying. Though, if those problems are too much for you, there is hope. Warner Bros. Records has plans to release another version of &quot;Tusk&quot; , with, I'm told, the full version of &quot;Sara&quot;, and judging by the pictures on Amazon.com, sans lettering.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Alice in Wonderland,has always been a favourite book of mine,and this Disney musical version is a brilliant adaptation.Not to mention the beautifully done animation.This new release retains the original's greatness,and throws in numerous extra goodies for children and adults alike! For example....if you like to listen in French or Spanish,the ENTIRE soundtrack is in those languages,including ALL of the songs! Kathryn Beaumont,the voice of Alice,also makes an appearance and looks as wonderful as she does in the archival footage,and leads you through some of the archive materials. For the \\"kids\\" there's a \\"Mad Tea Party\\" interactive video game,a \\"match the cards\\" card game,sing-a-long videos,and an escape from Wonderland quiz game.For the \\"adults\\" there's the rare \\"Thru The Mirror\\",Mickey Mouse cartoon,( Which inspires many Card routines for \\"Alice\\" ),and the very first Disney Television Show (\\"An Hour In Wonderland\\" with Walt Disney, Kathryn Beaumont,Bobby Driscol,Edgar Bergen,Charlie McCarthy,and Knucklehead Smith ). For \\"the collector\\" there's the trailers,numerous art galleries,a collection of song demos,storyboards for a couple of deleted scenes,\\"Operation Wonderland\\" ( A 1950 behind the scenes featurette ),a rare original \\"Alice\\" comedy from the 1930's,Walt's two televsion intros. from 1954 and 1964,and Kathryn Beaumont & Sterling Holloway performing selections on \\"The Fred Waring Show\\". Also of note,\\"An Hour In Wonderland\\",a black and white show featuring excerpts from previous Disney movies,cuts to colour when those parts are shown.( Also of note,this DVD features the FIRST release of an excerpt from \\"Song Of The South\\"! See Uncle Remus sing \\"Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah\\" in all it's glory!).<br />The one disappointment is the highly touted Cheshire Cat song \\"I'm Odd\\". Firstly,the Disney folks wrote nearly 100 songs for this film.( It was planned as far back as the early 40's.).\\"I'm Odd\\" apparently got lost,the music score anyways. So,this DVD contains a NEW recording ofthat song....in other words it's NOT sung by Sterling Holloway,nor is there any lost animation to accompany it. It's even less of an \\"artifact\\" than the original song demos included,and frankly is a poor selling point.( This DVD would've sold without that sort of hype to begin with.) But,this is a small problem. This DVD is BRILLIANT! It's FUN! And Children,Adults,& Child/Adults can all enjoy it,alone or together!By all means,join this Mad Tea Party,and give yourself an Un-Birth Day Gift!
6305291446|5.0|now here is one that lives up to the original.<BR>after an awful! 5th installment, this gem comes along!<BR>it has a typical story, but it works, because they got ppl that could act.  cool beggining and end, that make u wonder...
B0000DJZA0|3.0|Overall, this is pretty good, but the sound quality comes and goes.  5.1 dts locks in but sure does not sound it some times.  Camera work is sometimes handheld and jittery, quite amatuerish..
B00005KHJV|4.0|wonderful, scary movie, but where the hell r the extras, the extended fottage is nice, but they could have at least put SOME extras, but no they make u pay another $30 dollars 4 the same movie and tons of extras, i dont recommend this edition but get the 25th anniversary one instead.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I love this CD it's been in heavy rotation since I bought it on Feb. 11th. Kanye West really did his thing on this album. As soon as I heard Through the Wire I couldn't wait for his album to be released. It's good to hear raps about other things rather than the same ole stuff (women, money, cars and etc.) Kanye raps about everyday stuff and it's great. I don't even really listen to rap that much, but I love this CD. If you want to hear a different style of rap you should definitely cop this album. It's a must have for all hip-hop, rap or r&amp;b lovers.<br />My Favorite Tracks:<BR>All Falls Down<BR>We Don't Care<BR>Jesus Walks<BR>Never Let You Down<BR>2 Words<BR>Through the Wire<BR>Last Call<BR>Family Business
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This album, I must say, takes several listenings-to.  The first time around -- especially if you're not familiar with his voice -- you might remember the repetition in &quot;Oh What A World&quot;, and possibly the hook to &quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot;.  The second time, you can start differentiating between songs.  Not that they sound even remotely the same, but it is a problem.  By the third or fourth time -- especially if you listen to the commentary available if you buy the album -- you realize, these are amazing songs.<br />From a musician's standpoint, his songs are incredibly interesting.  Most pop songs have limited harmonic and melodic palates -- these, which have been called Broadway-esque and popera, do not.  I'm half expecting a musical theatre type to show up with one of these songs as his or her audition piece.  To me, the songs don't seem so much 'written' as composed.  It isn't just the production, either -- there are songs on previous albums (&quot;In a Graveyard&quot;, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;) that I could point to and remark on the care taken with elements of the songs.  The fact that he sees himself maybe someday composing an opera also resonates with this.  &quot;Harvester of Hearts&quot;, while intended merely as an amusing quasi-lounge tune, is nonetheless well-done: if someone had played it for me and told me it was from a musical (Kander &amp; Ebb style), I would have believed them.  &quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot; is an apocalyptic crescendo, with quotes from Debussy (&quot;Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum&quot;, a piano piece), and lyrics that are truly frightening in implications.  (His quote on the song is, &quot;Don't ever do crystal meth.  I already wrote the song about it, so you don't have to go through it, okay?&quot;)<br />As to his voice, it's described as a scratchy bari-tenor.  Yes, it's a bit scratchy.  Maybe even grating at the beginning.  Possibly somewhat out of tune.  The more you listen to this album, or any of his albums, you realize a few things: one, that you don't care about scratchiness; two, that if he is actually out of tune, it's 'interestingly out of tune' and you don't really care anyway; and three, that he's had vocal training.  (See the very end of &quot;Vibrate&quot; for that.)  And not just from his mother.  He manages to be quite expressive in many different styles.<br />Emotionally honest, powerful, campy, lyrical -- I have to say, it holds together as an album better than the previous two.  So if you weren't sure the first time you listened to it, try again.  And again.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Too often musicals on film fall back to the long shot/proscenium arch style of moviemaking in order to show chorus lines of dancers doing their stuff.  Other times they have been all close-ups and no dancing or performing skill.  I assumed this movie might bore me for any number of reasons, but the opposite is true.  I've seen it several times now and several things strike me -- the musical arrangements and &quot;medleys&quot; are outstanding, the art direction is exciting, and the story, which is tragic, is nevertheless compelling.<br />I really like this movie.  The rock music, some of it re-interpreted for the pure voices of Kidman and MacGregor, is enthralling and exciting, and that is the best part.  My favorite section is the intertwining of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and a classic punk rock number during the chaotic dance hall establishing sequence, with &quot;We Can be Heroes&quot; a close second, but there are many others to choose from.<br />Visually and in choreographic terms Moulin Rouge reminds me of one of Fellini's color films. But this film is absolutely much more accessible to a modern American mainstream audience.  Everything technical about this movie -- the pace of the editing, the acting, the music, the camera, the lighting -- is a treat.<br />Complaining that this is not an original score is like saying there should be no Oscar for &quot;best screenplay based on material from another medium.&quot;  The music as re-interpreted to tell this movie's story is positively moving.  It is quite possible that people are sometimes running this DVD at home for its audio alone.  It's my favorite musical since Cabaret.
B00005JME0|5.0|When I first saw the previews I was pretty excited to go see The Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, I then read some very scathing reviews (though I should know better than to ever trust the LA Weekly). Still, my interest got the best of me.<br />This is an excellent movie. It touches it all, from dysfunctional familes to relativistic time, from childhood fears (and our adult worse fears) to a mature understanding and commitment to love. Real fuel for a late night conversation.<br />At each step of the way, this movie's about choices - the one's we would make in the past, could we return with the mind of an adult and the determination to save our friends. Could you really make the future better without ruining something else? If you had to make the decision to sacrifice just one person's happiness, who would it be? If you had the power to change the past, at what point would you stop using it?<br />5 solid stars.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|IMHO, the Matrix was a sleeper hit; it got recommended to me by some woman working with me in Miami whose opinion I never trusted; in promoting The Matrix to me she earned a modicum of trust and respect.  The finest \\"sleeper\\" film, in sci-fi, I've ever had the privledge of being knocked over by...<br />Reloaded, IMHO< kept up the energy by taking it to the next level, and doing what no other sci-fi blockbuster sequel has EVER done for me...it made me think...it was DENSE, slick, and ultimately watchable over and OVER again.  Reloaded is my favorite, w/o question...the first one set the stage, the second one had the perfect cliffhanger(s), with Bane and Neo on the gurneys, and Neo disvocering powers in the Real World, and the Machines coming...those two movies were as perfect as big-budget blockbuster sci-fi, with every studio suit in your bsiness, can be.<br />Then we get to Revolutions, and crap the bed.<br />Just horrible.  Simply terrible.  The worst ending to two great films there ever will be.<br />What were they thinking?<br />I cannot recommend this movie any less; <br />I'm still waiting for the third film; this so-called \\"film\\" the Brothers put out there; that was a JOKE, right?<br />I await a real ending to the trilogy, and inspired one, not this typical and common action trash...<br />it was horrible.<br />If you liked the first two films, you'll HATE the third one.<br />If you hated the first two films, you'll like this garbage.<br />To the Brothers:<br />We are still waiting. Seriously.
B000002540|5.0|In brief, I agree with the many reviewers who have preceded me in ranking On Your Feet as the greatest live rock album ever.  Like Shakespeare plays, it contains just about ever important cliche (or what has become a cliche) you need to know.<br />On a personal note, this was one of the first albums I ever owned.  I have listenned voraciously to rock'n'roll for 30 years and, in terms of musical tastes, have journeyed quite widely.  Nevertheless, I seem to final in this album an inexhaustible source of pleasure.  In particular, ME262 soars like German jet to the very heights of rock'n'roll, supercharging the studio version and thundering ahead with an explosion of rock, blues, and boogie unlike any other I know.  (&quot;1-2, 1-2-3-4!&quot;)
B0000AUHPB|5.0|A wonderful action movie set during 1969 Italy and England.  This movie is actually better than the remake.  When I first heard that someone had finished making the remake, I tried to find a copy of the original.  I remembered seeing it on TV years ago and that it was a great show.  The music in the original is super and true to the era.  What makes this movie great is the Minis ofcourse, but also Michael Caine.  I bought the original.  Too bad they never made the sequel that had orginally been planned.
0671027344|5.0|this book got me started on my reading frenzy. i loved it. it left be wanting to be like charlie (boy in the book)or to have a friend like him. it was beautiful and changed my view on a lot of things. it was one of those books that just leaves u thinking at the end.
B00013EY7Q|1.0|This was the most uneventful film I have ever seen. It is like a bad reality show about a man on an uneventful business trip. I cannot believe this movie got any attention at all.  I think what was lost in translation was the point to the viewer.  There was no point. If I had to tell you about the movie I would say it was about a man on a business trip who met a girl whos husband was on a business trip. They exchanged words now and again. He went home. The end.
0780631684|4.0|This is a very good show, it is packed full of action and scary moments. It could've easily recieved 5 stars but the music is horrible, the acting isn't exactly 5 star material either.
B000127LW2|3.0|When the premise for the next STAR TREK series in the franchise was first released, fans rallied with mixed emotions at the fact that now the captain's seat on the bridge of the newest starship was to be helmed by a woman...but it just made perfect sense!  TREK had explored all aspects of the \\"final frontier\\" and were we to believe that in the 24th century there weren't any intrepid female leaders braving the unknown of space exploration.<br />The center gem of the third spin-off in TREK lore is of course it's captain (as it should be) Kathyrn Janeway as protrayed by Kate Mulgrew etched her own legend; a status all onto herself that may not have always worked but she made  it worth tuning into every week.  She is a captain not unlike her predecesors faced with own unique challenges.  Janeway must get her crew home after losing them in the far reaches of an unknown part of the galaxy.<br />The VOYAGER'S journey begins!  We're introduced to the crew of Starfleet and Maquis rebels who are joined under one banner to survive the 75 year journey back home -- and along the way, they make some new friends and terrible enemies.
B00005JM02|3.0|Whoever thinks this is movie of the year is stupid. I gotta admit, it has a few funny parts but that is not enough for it to be called better than Along Came Polly, School of Rock, Scary Movie 3, or Bruce Almighty. Spend your hard earned cash on one of those 4 movies not this one!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This, as well as all of Epic's AC/DC reissues is amazing. The packaging is great, and the booklets that come inside are well done. Most of all, they finally do AC/DC justice sound-wise. Notice on the older issues of the discs, they sounded more like a worn-out cassette than a cd. I'm pleased to say that the re-issued discs sound amazing...and it's about time! You've already heard the songs, and without question it's worthy of 5-stars. This rating, however, is more for the packaging and (vastly) improved sound quality from prior releases.
0792838785|2.0|Ok, i like Bond movies but this one stinks I fell asleep about an 45 minutes through. Has its moments but it isn't worth buying. Spend your money on real action, like, I don't Know, TERMINATOR!!!!!
B000002IXS|3.0|I absolutely adore the work of Mireille Mathieu, I own several of her albums.  But the least played in our house is this one; least played by far.  The French decided decades ago that Mireille was Edith reincarnate and that has apparently haunted her career.  I've read that after nearly thirty years she relented and did this Piaf album, and she proved she was right all along - this music belongs to only Edith.<br />Three stars here because Mathieu puts her own mark on several songs and they stand well, especially \\"Mon manege a moi\\" - and she does well with \\"La vie en rose\\". But on too many songs she seems almost self-conscious, her usual enthusiasm vanishes.  She sings the words but her heart doesn't seem to be in it; Especially on \\"Mon Dieu\\" and on one of Piaf's signature songs, \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\".<br />If you are lucky enough to own her \\"Embrujo\\" album try listening to the wonderful \\"L'hymne a l'amour\\" on this album and then on \\"Embrujo\\", which is in Spanish.  Her effort in Spanish is so much more free, effortless, and beautiful - it's her, not Piaf, and it works.<br />Finally, the choice of a few of the songs leaves me bewildered.  If I were trimming the work of Edith Piaf to thirteen songs I don't think I'd include \\"Exodus\\", it's not really Edith's song.  And why on earth did they include the silly novelty motorcycle song, \\"The Terror of Highway 101\\" translated to French?  It's like honoring Sinatra with \\"Old MacDonald\\".  My Goodness.<br />Anyhow, Mireille will remain my favorite singer alive today. And Edith will remain my favorite in the history of mankind.  And never the twain shall meet.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|T3 is a great movie, and probably one of the Top 10 of 2003. The only reason I am disappointed is that the first two Terminators where so good that this one just doesn't match them. The bonus features are awsome though so i recommend buying this DVD.
B00003CXGP|1.0|kids and teenagers love christian bale, so it has that going for it and it does have potential, but mostly this movie is an overly self aware and tedious slasher \\"black comedy\\"- I did watch the whole thing, however, so I guess it's better than one star-- but not quite 2.
630521610X|5.0|Scream is the 2nd best horror movie ever made, and almost as good as Halloween. It is definetly the most original horror movie ever, great acting, superb story, lots of gore but not enough to make it stupid. Scream rocks you should definetly buy it, don't rent it!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Most DVD's with &quot;bonus&quot; footage include cut scenes and various throwaways that the director had some fondness for.  This version, however (which I had the good fortune to see in the theater before the release of Return of the King) is much better than the original release, because the materials that are worthy are incorporated back into the story, and seamlessly so.  The most interesting (and frightening) addition are the Huorns, ent-like trees that move.  The final destruction of the Orcs, while not bloody (you don't even see them) is nonetheless more than a little disturbing. The added scenes with Faramir and Boromir together also helped flesh out the story a good deal.  A word of caution for the two or three people who've read Tolkien's books and not yet seen this movie: This installment of the LoTR diverts the farthest from the storyline in the novel.  Personally, I thought the changes, while giving Eowyn more exposure, were on the whole not helpful to the story line (most importantly, the residents of Edoras, rather than retreating to Dunharrow, actually move TOWARD Isengard to hole up in Helm's Deep.  Still and all, a tremendous movie, and one I'll enjoy seeing again.
0140277447|1.0|China is invading Japan. China has been sending ships into Japanese territory Senkaku Islands in order to accumulate faits accomplis and, in the future, declare Senkaku Islands are Chinese territory. Next target would be Okinawa. As you know, China is expanding its territory e.g. Tibet and Uigur. Most of Asia will be occupied by China if we ignore Chinese aggressive policy.<br />Iris Chang's &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot; is a propaganda purposing to make Japanese subordinate to China. It is most deplorable so many Japaneses and Americans are deceived by Chinese Communists' fabrications while many intelligent Chineses know their government never tell the truth.
0375760067|5.0|I was nearly put off reading this by friends who termed it \\"depressing\\".  This trivialises it, for it is, to my mind, truly tragic.  In a shockingly irresponsible drunken act, protagonist Michael Henchard sells his wife at a local fair.  The consequences, stretching over a couple of decades, sweep away both him and other characters.<br />The plot teems with journeys, coincidences, long-lost people showing up, and a strong vein of morality.  In typical Hardyesque style, Henchard moves from the height of civic success to bankruptcy and alienation.  A quasi-Greek-tragedy air of fate prevails, but Hardy manages to keep suspense alive.  Protagonist and antagonist (Farfrae) are pitted against each other on civic and domestic fronts.  There is not one Mayor of Casterbridge, but two, and success, failure and rivalry play a large part.  There is also competition among the males as lovers, husbands and fathers.<br />This novel gives an insight into civic life,  the worthy burgesses of Casterbridge networking in their council-rooms and taverns.  But the animal instincts of the wife-sale,  the gutter-press viciousness of the locals' \\"skimmity-ride\\", and the proximity of the countryside, where so many Victorian characters wander to survive and to lay bare their feelings, reveal the fragility of civilisation and our urban constructs.<br />Great stuff.
B0001AP12G|5.0|With the &quot;retirement&quot; of Roc-a-Fella's messiah Jay-Z, the less than stellar performance of Memphis Bleek's latest album, and Beanie Seagel's legal trouble, the R.O.C. was in need of a resurrection.  Enter Kanye West, Roc-a-Fella's new &quot;savior.&quot;  The producer turned rapper, whom we were already familiar with from Jigga's Blueprint album, produced  the hits &quot;I.Z.Z.O.&quot; and the &quot;Takeover,&quot; which as we all know fueled the feud with Nas.  This debut album exceeds all expectations.  It is smart, innovative, and fun.  There are several great songs on this album and I will break down my personal favorites, so let's get started:<br />We Dont Care<br />It's hard to endorse a song that glorifies drug dealing, but this is great song.  In fact this song, which opens the album, shows off West's lyrical skills.  This song provides a very real and graphic description of the grind of trying to work and survive in the ghetto.  Kanye's melodic delivery coupled with the realities of the street make &quot;We don't care,&quot; a song to definitely care about.<br />All Falls Down<br />This is a song about vanity.  A true rip on the problems troubling black society.  On this track West speaks on how poor self esteem and the goal of trying to &quot;appear wealthy,&quot; by buying fancy clothes and cars you can't afford keeps us broke.<BR>My favorite line on this track is &quot;she couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis (a lexus).  Very important song.<br />Jesus Walks<br />A brave statement of Kanye's faith in God.  Not many rappers are willing to to boldly speak on topics like this, but West is absolutely flawless.  Chilling track.<br />Through the Wire<br />We have all heard this song.  It is simply the best Hip Hop song lyrically in quite a while and definitely the song of the year.  To be able to document the experience of being almost killed and detail his recovery period so poetically, elevates West to Hip Hop's upper class.  It is the soul of the album.<br />Slow Jamz<br />Jamie Foxx?  Who knew that Wanda from &quot;In Living Color&quot; could sing? This song is blazing in night clubs nationwide. The odd pairing of Foxx, West, and Twista flows perfectly over the old Chaka Khan hit.  Twista is on his game.  The only problem that I hav with this song is that it may convince Jamie Foxx that he should make an album, and I don't think we are ready for that.  Can anyone say Eddie Murphy?  <br />That's all I got.  Go get the album...it's FIRE!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave isn't exactly the metallic force we'd all expect, but in turn they are equally good as a supergroup unleashing their powerful debut album. A combination of heavy hard-hitting rock songs with the complex and slower songs. Great songs like Cochise, Gasoline and Show Me How To Live have a strangely interesting chemistry with Like a Stone, I am the Highway and more. In my opinion, this is one of the ebst albums of 2002-2003.<BR>Chris Cornells vocals are good and guitars have their freaky sound like that of Rage Against the Machine.<br />Definetely a Must Buy!
0385504209|3.0|What do authors do? They come up with an idea, then they have to build a,,,book,,, around that idea. This idea starts off quite well really. I will summarize my review before I finish, &quot;This is a successful attempt to reach the mass market novel readers based on a single exploited Sacrament that had to be glued together with hundreds of pages filled with random ideas from many sources.&quot; One of those sources was definitely Holy Blood Holy Grail. Whether you like this book or not will depend on your taste and level of tolerence. For me the meat of the book is less than I would expect, the premise is fine, however the one great and not so obvious item to so many,,, is very disappointing to me,,,The meaning of the Holy Grail is lost in this and many other books and movies similar. When Christ spoke,&quot; He who drinks of this,,,cup&quot;. I am neither Christain or atheist, but I at least understand that he meant the Holy Grail was and is within you when you accept Christ. The entire scope of these books knowingly flaunts at the height of disrespect for the intended meaning of the Holy Grail. How do millions fall for basic fluantful entertainment out of something meant so sacramental? Nothing is sacred when it can be eploited for gain. Read SB 1 or God by Maddox, the Grail is inside, and obviously hidden.
0385504209|5.0|With &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; Dan Brown reprises his last novel, &quot;Angels and Demons,&quot; by bringing back both his Robert Langdon character, and the fast and furious tone that make both books such thrilling reads. Let's be frank about this book. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is not a great literary work. What it is is a LOT of fun to read.<br />While less complex and demanding than &quot;Angels and Demons,&quot; this effort is no less enjoyable. The action starts with an early murder in Paris, and picks up speed after a brief and amusing scene involving Landon and a stereotypical French Chief Investigator. However, the reader soon learns the identity and motivation of the true murderer, after which the story transposes quickly into a rather cliche search for the Holy Grail, which is interesting, if not original. Brown didn't originate the ideas on which this story is based, and he doesn't claim credit for them. While they don't form the basis for a particularly believable story, Brown does successfully use them to generate a palpable sense of urgency around the story line, and that drives the reader from page to page in a flurry.<br />The book reads quickly, and with immense satisfaction. I felt like Brown was leading me around with a carrot on a stick, just letting me get a little nibble here and there, while he unfolded chapter after chapter of this thriller. My only complaint is that I thought the ending wasn't particularly dramatic or satisfying enough for the plot: the climax just kind of fades away, instead of delivering the whole ending in a nice, wrapped-up package.<br />In the end, the grail story is an apt subject for this book. In fact, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is quite an apt metaphor itself for the search for the Grail. Not so much as a murderer, Langdon and his co-protagonist, Sophie Neveu, are playing out a great scavenger hunt in search of the answers to some of life's greatest mysteries. And while Brown's themes of the Grail are far from mainstream, there's just enough of a hint of believability to draw the reader into the story and keep him there.<br />The bottom line is that this book is fantastically fun to read. Don't look for anything else, here; this book doesn't need it. Don't critique it or analyze it. Buy it and read it just for fun. On that level, it scored five stars from me. I'll buy the next one from Brown, too.

B00018HU4U|5.0|'feels like home' is a great follow-up from Norah Jones. I bought it songs-unheard and I love it.  I may be biased because I tend to enjoy a little injection of bluegrass...  and she blends it with her jazzy style seamlessly! I am glad that she tried something a little different - keeps it freah. Of course her voice is awesome...  and my faves so far are: sunrise, what am i to you?, creepin' in, toes, and the long way home.  Thanks Norah!
031286504X|3.0|Although I did enjoy this novel, I dont understand how it is even comparable to Stephen King horror books. Yes this book was exciting yet I dont think it had the true horror that exists in most of King's novels. I must say though, I truly enjoyed the last chapter very much. It made a lot of great, horrifying  points about humanity in general. There were also a couple of other short stories by Matheson in this book. I did not feel any of them were up to the same caliber as &quot;I am Legend.&quot; &quot;Prey&quot; and &quot;Mad House&quot; were somewhat unique yet overall short stories do not appear to be Matheson's forte. Overall this book was unique in its plot and an enjoyable read
B00008H2LB|4.0|I liked pretty much every song except for Nobody's Listening.  I'm just not into the hip hop sound.  Anyways the cd is too short because there's only 13 tracks, and 2 aren't &quot;real&quot; songs (foreward and session&quot;).  Otherwise its pretty good.
B00018D44U|3.0|Well, after selling millions copies of 1st album, she did brought something special and blew the worries off a thousand miles.  But, it does not really clearly defining her musical journey to be fruitful and seems missing somethin'.  After listening the album several times, it only grew stronger that the begining and the end is not strong enough to break my imagination and only limiting her self-portrait with numerous instruments' sounds which are not fully aligned and not even interplay in some place.  I guess too many straight monologues can be too plain.  It is a good album among the many, but not satisfying at this moment.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I thought this movie would be boring and hokey, but it was incredible!  I highly recommend this movie for a date night or if you want to watch a high quality flick with excellent acting and a well written story.  The story is pretty incredible and might bring a tear to your eye.
B00018D44U|5.0|It's very rare for me to buy a CD and like every song the first time I hear it. Norah Jones has done this to me twice. This new CD \\"Feels Like Home\\" I admit is better than the first CD from Ms. Jones. The artistry and soulful pureness of her voice rings true to the greats that have come before her and who are her peers, like on the last track \\"Don't miss you at all\\" which reminds me of  Billie Holiday's \\"Very thought of you,\\" and her sultry voice also reminds me of Etta James, Bonnie Raitt, Patsy Cline, and Dusty Springfield just to name a few. I hope to hear more from this very talented singer and songwriter in the future and will embrace each new CD as new painting on a canvas revealing some new passion, thought, spiritual awakening, or emotion at each listen to cherish for years to come. Thank you Norah! Have a good day and a better tomorrow. Peace, Dean.
0385504209|4.0|I just recently read The Da Vinci Code and am still trying to figure out what the entire hullabaloo is about.  The book puts forth nothing I haven't heard before.  I find it sad that evidently so many people in the world have so little religious training.<br />The Da Vinci Code is a page turning suspense/mystery.  I truly enjoyed Dan Brown's writing.
B00005JMGC|5.0|it was a must see classic! Once again Julia Roberts captures the audience!
B0001A79JO|5.0|Having seen the Pops live, I was interested to find out what they would sound like trapped on CD. The CD opens with what will be their big hit - Julia, which introduces you to their sound very well. Next come Drama Queen and Ghouls, both fairly aggressive songs, next up is Girl in a Cage, a great blend of ska and rock and roll. After that comes Miss Take which would be right at home on a Siouxsie album. Then comes my personal fave on the album - Where They Wander, a storming 3 minute sprint. Then it is onto Kool Flattop, could be a tribute to Kim. Then the slightly dark surf of Psychobitches Outta Hell. Slowing us down again is Dotted With Hearts, but we speed right up again for Baby Lou Tattoo and What's Under my Bed. Bringing us down is Emotional Abuse, with its catchy chorus. The last track is a gem - Horrorbeach, which will have you busy playing 'what surf song is that taken from?' for ages.<BR> All in all, a great US debut album, and if you get the chance, see them live.
B00005U1YO|5.0|que puedeo decir, es un exelente album, donde la homogeneidad de los beats te hace viajar por un trance de euforia y lacitud continua. comprenlo es un disco genial.
B00005JM0B|1.0|As a stand alone movie, if there was no T1 and T2, this was OK. As a sequel it was no more than a parody. The in jokes were funny, but it was a sad end to an amazing series.<br />Stahl was a joke as Connor. His future self looked hideous and hilarious. He doesn't look like a hero and Edward Furlong is sorely missed. Claire Danes as his girlfriend/future wife was lame.  She was no Sarah Connor and never would be. Linda Hamilton was also missed, but she was smart enough to stay away from a great story turned action comedy.<br />The female terminator was simply a device to get young boys interested, but lacked Patrick's menace, and at the end they make her seem more like a alien monster than a machine with all that animalistic screaming.<br />Arnold tried to be the Terminator again, but many lines fell flat. He too played a parody of his old character. He was also too old for the part and it showed in his face.<br />Yeah, the ending wasn't expected, but  I didn't care.<br />The whole thing was a sad disappointing experience.
0385510438|5.0|A great read. John Grisham is back to his best form. Couldn't put it down - especially at the end.
0061015725|4.0|Jack Forman is suspicious of his wife of having an affair at work. When he goes to investigate, it turns out more than just an affair. Xymos Technology, the secret research lab where his wife works, has created nanotechnology too advanced for themselves to handle. In &quot;Prey,&quot; swarms of self-replicating micro-robots start to evolve and they advance too fast to keep under control. The only way to resolve this is to destroy them before they destroy us. Jack Forman, programmer of the predator-prey software that the micro-robots are running on, is the only hope. Nanotechnology has become too dangerous, and soon the humans are going to be taken over by the micro-robots. They must be stopped before they become even more dangerous. <br />Michael Crichton has again written a thrilling book. His plot seems incredibly realistic, because he has done so much research on nanotechnology. He does so much research on all of his books, making them seem especially true and believable. A message he is trying to send to us is that nanotechnology is getting more and more advanced, and that soon it will be out of control if we are not careful. <br />The book starts out as slow paced, but then it slowly pulls you in and prepares you for the fast-paced action towards the end. It is not necessarily a scary plot, but it is making us aware of the dangers of nanotechnology if not controlled properly. Like most of his other books, the plot seems perfect for a movie. The storyline is easy to follow, and the action is intense and thrilling. It is easy to picture the story in your head, with Crichton's detailed descriptions. It is hard to put down, and I highly recommend this book. If you are a fan of Crichton's or a high-tech science-fiction fan, then you should definitely read it.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Although cliche at times, Terminator 2: Judgment Day became a mountain of a movie, thanks to a terrific performance by Robert Patrick as the stealth T-1000 advanced killer, as well as our new reprogrammmed hero, the T-101 (Schwarzenegger). Since those events that took place in 1991, John Connor has lost his mother, Sarah, to lukemia. He's a young man now, living away from the grid of society, and drifting endlessly through America on a motorbike.<br /> In the wake of the city night, a shapely nude female (Kristanna Loken) emerges from time travel, and kills a civilian, taking her leather body suit and car. She's the new Terminator, the T-X. More advanced and lethal than the T-1000, it can change it's appearence and multiple weapons at will. Kind of like a sexy walking 'Guns \\"R\\" Us'. Elsewhere, Arnold materializes out from time travel in the desert, and again finds duds in a strip bar that look better than his other two leather ensembles from both movies. The T-101 has good taste. <br />John breaks into a vet lab for some pain killers after a motorcycle accident. The veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Daines) arrives to investigate and discovers Connor, who are then both discovered by the T-X. They are near mincemeat status when Arnold shows up and drives his stolen 4x4 into her head on. Owch. Connor is stunned to see another T-101 save his hide for a second time. He finds a way to convince the new victim, Kate, about the future and who he is, and who John will become, although it understandably takes a while.<br />After a healthy start, the chase is on as out female T-X stops for nothing to eliminate John and Kate as their existence in the future jeopardizes all machines. There's plenty of running around and a clumsy truck/car chase that's not very interesting. A lot of the fight sequences are quick and dealt with. Arnold and Loken also get in a fist fight for a moment that turns into a throw around. Oh, what a fight (yawwwwwn). How many times the two humans duck energy blasts and missles, or yell, \\"Run for it!\\" is beyond me. There's no outsmarting or clever sequences, minus one near the end. The effects are more than great, animation, explosions, you name it. This is how the movie holds itself afloat to some point.<br />Terminators, regardless of what model they are, should almost kill you with their stare, or even physique. Loken is the new villan, and given the title, she delivers only moderate shivers. Mechanically, she has the stare and walk of a Terminator down pat-you bet, and her act does convince us quite well. Her T-X is not very intense and doesn't scare us as much as Robert Patrick's stealth T-1000. Schwarzenegger gets good marks for his beefy T-101 Terminator, and even though he \\"is the one\\" to play this role, I sometimes curl an 'oh brother' smirk when I listen to the cyborg relenquish a Belgian accent. <br />Stahl gives a neat change with the role of John Connor, who, because of the scenarios that he went through with his mother, one protector Terminator, and one killer Terminator, seems more in a state of disbelief and drunk from sadness. Claire Danes also has a neat performance as a young woman who would soon realize what the future holds, and without making her another She-Rambo, toughens up, but realistically. <BR> <BR>There is something missing in this movie that a lot of people don't immediately recognize. For John and Kate, Judgement Day is unavoidable. It was only delayed from last time. The fear of what it will bring is only moderately considered by the two humans. Most people would be so hysterical, knowing that it's guaranteed the world will be obliterated, minus a few thousand humans. The amount of pure dread from these two is hardly enough. <br />This movie would have been much better, say, if we took a trip into the bleak future, where humans are scattered across the lands, and machines seem unstoppable. That would have made a great movie and should have been the premise of this third installment.Personally, the time travel thing is enough.  <br />The only way, besides showcasing great effects and some neat tricks, \\"T3\\" does give us an ending that could have been more devestating, but still gives us a shiver. This is really the only time in the movie where Stahl and Danes finally inject a lot of fear into the horrifying inevitable. T3 is not very impressive, and I wished that the ending, although effective, was even deeper.
0385510438|3.0|I guess I always compare a new Grisham book to The Firm, which was my first exposure to him and one of the best books I've read.  The Last Juror is written in a nice, first person, very conversational style.  It is believable.  It has a positive social message.  There is some clever humor woven into the tale.  Those are the good things.  The bad things are not so much bad as just a bit dull.  The book is definitely not a page-turner.  There are no surprises or twists to the story at all.  The characterization is as unremarkable as the plot.  Still, I read the whole book, so it wasn't THAT dull.  If you are a die-hard-read-everything-Grisham-writes person, you'll want to get this and read it.  But if you are looking for the kind of writing you'd find in Mystic River by Lehane, for example, you will be disappointed in this book's lack of it.
B000099T2L|1.0|I've listened to this album several times and I can say with complete confidence that only 2 songs are decent:  &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Baby Boy,&quot; both of which were released as singles.  The rest of the album is crap filler and a waste of time!  I think I would have had more respect for Beyonce if she had released a 2-track CD rather than a 15-track CD with 13 bad songs!  I'm still shocked and somewhat offended that this album won 5 grammy awards when so many other albums are 100 times more deserving!  I advise you not to waste your money on this highly mediocre album!!
B00005JKC3|2.0|A character like the Hulk is so caged in comic book legend that any film version of it will face the scrutiny of fans. As a fan of the Hulk, and hearing the great hype about the CGI animation, I watched \\"The Hulk\\" with hope, only to be disappointed. Too much of the movie is about the origin and unexplained subtexts, and not enough about the story Stan Lee and company made famous.<br /><br />The story here begins slowly and vaguely. I was confused from the start with what Bruce Banner's father, David, was doing. Things are different from how Marvel's Hulk originated, and other fans will surely be as confused.<br /><br />Bruce's relationship with Betty is similarly confusing. Are they dating, or did they just break up? Do they love each other, or using each other's emotions to meet some professional goals?<br /><br />Eric Bana, as Bruce, gave a performance that meant nothing. There was nothing to relate to as his deadpan, unexpressive personality provided only a place keeper until the Hulk raged out from him.<br /><br />Bruce's relationship with his father is filled with inconsistencies. Throughout the movie, I never knew if his father cared for him, or saw him as a scientific project.<br /><br />I never understood why, if David was such a threat to the government, and if his crimes were so terrible, was he allowed out of prison.<br /><br />Other unanswered questions: Why was the Hulk's wrecking of the lab largely ignored? How was a big corporation manipulating the military? Why didn't Betty tell her father about the giant dogs? Why didn't the Hulk kill Talbot when he had no moral trouble killing the guys in the tank?<br /><br />Stylistically, Ang Lee worried more about mimicking the comic book rather than expanding on the story. The result was a video comic, not the pop cinema masterpiece it could have been. The Hulk looks good, but too much like a colored drawing imposed upon celluloid. The special effects might be technically strong, but not as impressive as the hype.<br /><br />This is a B-movie tramped up into a high-publicity project that never meets its mark. Ang Lee screwed it up by dwelling on secondary concerns.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comy project that never meets its mark.

I've seen the Chili's live three times, I have three other of their DVD's, and all of their CD's...but this is BY FAR THE BEST Red Hot Chili Pepper disc I have ever bought...firstly, the atmosphere of the Live at Slane concert was INSANE..I really feel like I was there when I'm watching this DVD...secondly, the set list here is INCREDIBLE, and anyone who knows the Chili peppers knows that listening to them in concert is BETTER than listening to them on CD, and finally, this DVD was put together VERY well, great angles, great effects...it all came together really well...the worst part of the entire DVD was the case, so don't judge the DVD by its cover...ITS AMAZING!

0739313126|1.0|Be careful reading this book. One may fancy it as a modern-day exciting mystery-thriller, but it really is a front to what is Roman Catholic bashing at its best.  It really traps the uninformed reader pulling the wool over its starving eyes and rivets him/her using a lot of high-powered Enquirer type treatise.  Lots of information on the book presented as \\"facts\\" are simply preposterous misrepresentations such as the patriarchy-based hierarchy which dates back to thousands of years before the Christian Church came into being. Magdalene, too, which the book says the Church has thrashed, is actually regarded as one of the its greatest Saints; in the Bible, she is mentioned as the sole benefactor of being the first ever witness of the risen Christ. It also mentions that the Bible itself (specifically the new testament) is touted as a bunch of literary fiction fabricated by Constantine when it was the Church that compiled the now known books of the Bible; funny thing is that the book bases most of its fact-finding premises on the Bible!  The notion of sex being demonized by the Church is another great myth perpetuated by the book, when Marriage is one of the Sacraments in the Church instituted by Christ. A lot of modern day new age type ideas being thrown at the uninformed reader, masked as truth by leveraging a lot of age-old misrepresentations and lies about the Church. The book crumbles as it produces its anti-climactic epilogue - a problem when you base your plots and themes on misrepresentations and lies it catches up with you. I think we've just been ushered into the \\"Fast Food era of Mystery Books\\" where there's a lot of taste and spices, but no real substance.
1400034779|5.0|Bravo, Mr. Smith, for creating such a delightful character in Precious Ramotswe. A plump divorcee in her early thirties, Mma Ramotswe decides to open the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in her small village near modern Botswana, using the inheritance left by her loving father upon his death. The unconventional act itself of creating a detective agency, when she has no experience or qualifications other than her calm self-assurance and determination, right away conveys the message to the reader that we're dealing with a special woman worthy of respect and affection. Using instinct and good old-fashioned common sense, Mma Ramotswe solves one case after another. In the process, introducing us to colorful characters in interesting circumstances, sometimes comical, sometimes horrible.<BR>The setting only increases the book's lure. Smith describes Africa with great love and reverence. Seen through the eyes of Mma Ramotswe, the beauty and mystery of Africa vividly appears in the mind. I found myself feeling almost ashamed of the self-imposed hectic life I lead in the sterile corporate world, constantly striving to attain bigger and better yuppie toys like leaf blowers and snow mobiles. I cheered Mma Ramotswe's scolding of people like me who fail to notice the beauty of our surroundings or to appreciate a good bowl of stew and a long chat with a friend while sitting on the porch watching the sun set.<BR>A refreshingly original story, simple and sweet. I can't wait to visit Mma Ramotswe again.
B000002GQK|4.0|Album #6 for the Moody Blues, 1971's &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,&quot; is a very beautiful album that features some of the Moodies' spaciest sounding music ever. The opening track, &quot;Procession,&quot; is one of the band's most progressive-sounding tracks, complete with UFO sounds, jungle &amp; rain sound effects, chanting, grunting, and the *very first* recorded use of an electronic drumkit (courtesy of drummer Graeme Edge). Guitarist Justin Hayward's &quot;The Story In Your Eyes&quot; is one of the band's most-popular rockers (and they still perform it in concert to this day). This is followed by two lovely songs in the form of flautist Ray Thomas' &quot;Our Guessing Game,&quot; and bassist John Lodge's lullaby for his young daughter, &quot;Emily's Song.&quot; Graeme Edge's &quot;After You Came&quot; is another fine Moodies rocker, and one of the best songs Edge ever wrote for the group (including a terrific performance on drums, too). Lodge's &quot;One More Time To Live,&quot; with it's partial reprise of &quot;Procession,&quot; is a very majestic number. Thomas' &quot;Nice To Be Here&quot; is the most lighthearted song on the album---it's practically a children's song---but it's very, very charming. Hayward's &quot;You Can Never Go Home&quot; is a truly gorgeous song, and, finally, there's keyboardist Mike Pinder's &quot;My Song,&quot; a very dramatic, haunting piece.The only reason I'm not giving &quot;Every Good Boy&quot; a perfect 5-star rating is because the Moodies lean a little too much on the softer, ballady side with this one, as wonderful as the ballads are. The album really only has two genuine rockers on it---&quot;The Story In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;After You Came.&quot; One or two more rockers would've certainly given the album a better-sounding balance with it's material. Nonetheless, &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; is still a very lovely, exquisite, classic Moody Blues album. Every good Moodies fan deserves to own it!
B00005UK1F|1.0|I don't get it, everyone raving about this, and talking about all the styles and influences contained... It's mostly plain heavy metal. Like... 15 minutes of typical one or two chord heavy metal with one or two note vocals, then a minute of something moderately interesting, then 15 more minutes of ordinary heavy metal, then a couple of minutes of something else... If you don't love heavy metal, avoid this album! If you want an album-length song that mixes somewhat heavy rock with other elements, Jethro Tull's classic &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; would be a good place to start, it's far more interesting and musical than this is. (As is their follow-up album &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, for the more adventurous.)
0739313126|4.0|A page truning novel which catches you from the first moment.  A murder in the Louvre, a chase across Paris, a mystery which goes back centuries.  It's all a great read for a cold winter's night.  But part of the fun is the pretense that there is a fact based story inderlying the mystery.  Jesus had a wife, Mary Magdelaine, who is the Holy Grail and secret societies, persecuted by the Church, have been protecting these truths through the many centuries, including Leonardo da Vinci in his time.  Unfortunatley the underlying research is flawed in many respects.  The 'facts' are largely based on &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;, which is a collection of amusing speculation tieing disparate bits of story, information and coincidences together and, in some cases, ignoring established facts.<br />Enjoy it as a novel. Ignore it as history.
0312263120|2.0|I loved Angels and Demons and I loved the Da Vinci Code but this book was not on the same level. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book and a fast read but there were several things that decreased the overall enjoyment of this book. For one the action seemed forced and the book was fairly predictable, also the book describes the NSA as being a mega powerful, top secret agency with far reaching powers but during the course of the book it seems as though this agency wasn't powerful nor even intelligent. In fact we only see three agents for most of the book. If you need to pass time on a flight or read a book while waiting for your doctors appointment, get this. If your expecting to be entertained and learn as well as enjoy yourself, get Angels and Demons.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|In addition to the acting performances, this film's excellence resides in the way it makes you contemplate the death penalty from both points of view.  The shifts between the crime scene, the perpetrator, and the nun's explorations of the scenario propagate attitude changes with every new scene.  You can see the horrible crime that was committed, and then you're made to consider the fact that further death -- executing the murderer -- will not really solve anything... and then, you sense the victim's family's desire to see their daughter's killer punished completely.  I was a against the death penalty until a friend of mine was needlessly killed by two guys leaving a robbery scene -- my friend's death was such an unnecessary waste, that I wanted the two killers to be exterminated.  &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; provides similar changes of perspective -- it may change the opinion you presently hold, regardless of whether you're for or against capital punishment.  It's a great movie to watch, and then to think about, to contemplate as deeply as you can.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Love Disney movies, but personally can't stand Michael Eisner, his tyrannical rule of the Disney company, destroying the legacy that Walt built, and despise the &quot;Moratorium&quot; that is imposed on certain movies. It's not about keeping the movies &quot;fresh&quot;, it's about trying to create &quot;collectibles&quot; and driving up the product's price once they go out-of-print.<br />That having said, Disney first said that the moratorium for the Platinum Edition movies would last 10 years. Then they announce that it would only last 5 years. Does that mean that &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; will be re-released in 2006 and 2007, respectively? Or does that only apply to the movies released after the announcement? Everything I have seen up to now seems to point out &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;BATB&quot; won't be seen for another 10 years. Does anyone have any updated information?<BR>Thanks.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|If any movie demonstrates the corruption of the &quot;system&quot; it is this childish movie that has no discernable value... I can not believe that this monster made by anyone other than FF Coppola's daughter would habve made it to any theater.  Horrible and embarrassing.
0385504209|5.0|Since the book has been out for almost a year, guess I'm a late bloomer on this one.  I'd have to say it's THE best book I've read in ages.<br />The subject matter is fascinating and illuminating.  Brown did a tremendous job taking the topic and weaving a superb suspense novel.  It's classified as fiction, however, it certainly has some very valid points.  With the world situation as it is, it made this reader pause and think.<br />I already have Angels & Demons sitting here ready to start.  A genius of an author with a unique twist on an old subject.  The story gripped me till the very end, as one twist after another was revealed.<br />Well done!
B00005KB9R|4.0|I have to say I do like the albums with Peter Tosh and bunny wailer much more than The later stuff. Maybe because I love both of their solo stuff especially tosh's pothead cult classic  &quot;legalize it&quot;. I will however agree with a former reviewer( I dont recall his name) that some of the songs are way to tedious for me. I shot  the sheriff as a prime example, but dont let this stop you from buying the album, I would purchase natty dread or exodus first though.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD has quickly become a classic and a must-have for all rock listeners. System of a Down has really improved their sound and lyrics. This CD is amazing from start to finish!<br />1. Prison Song - 6/10 - This is one of the weaker songs on the CD. Serj's vocals are pretty good, but this song is pretty repetitive.<br />2. Needles - 9/10 - This is where the CD really starts. This adrenaline-packed track is full of growling, loud riffs and a strong drumline. The bridge, where Daron sings, is a really contrast the echoing chaos of the rest of the song.<br />3. Deer Dance - 8/10 - This is a good, better-than-averadge song. It's got a good chorus and a fast-paced verse.<br />4. Jet Pilot - 8/10 - Very fast, confusing song. Says something about a horse, but the rest is like utter nonsense. A little repetitive, but since when has repitition sounded so good?<br />5. X - 7/10 - Ok song, not as good as the songs so far (except Prison Song). Pretty basic, catchy, but nothing really stands out.<br />6. Chop Suey! - 10/10 - One of the best tracks on this CD. This is the first single, but it doesn't stop its utter onslaught of awesomeness upon your ears. The bridge is the best part.<br />7. Bounce - 8/10 - Always gotta have a song about a &quot;Pogo stick&quot;. A lot like Jet Pilot, but a little better. Very good background vocals in the chorus.<br />8. Forest - 10/10 - My favorite song on this CD. Awesome chorus, awesome verses! The lyrics are really good. You can System stayed awake late one night perfecting these...<br />9. ATWA - 6/10 - My least favorite song. Nothing really stands out, not very catchy, no real System-like fast beats or anything.<br />10. Science - 8/10 - Good song. The riffs are solid and precise, and there's a little bit of Armenien influences in it.<br />11. Shimmy - 9/10 - This song gets my adrenaline pumping. It's a short song, but it's still awesome.<br />12. Toxicity - 10/10 - Second single, solid song. Great drumline. More of a mellow song (no screaming), but still hard and it delivers a powerful chorus.<br />13. Psycho - 9/10 - Great song! A little repetitve, but in a good way. Powerful, strong, and good.<br />14. Aerials - 10/10 - Third single, but still awesome.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, is an extraordinarily profound book that will definitely have you rolling on the floor in laughter or tear-spilling sympathy. Piscine Patel lives in India and is the son of a zookeeper. His family owns the local zoo where Piscine, preferably Pi, spends countless afternoons observing and caring for the animals. He adopts three religions, Hinduism, Christianity, and Muslim and is an active participant in each. An example of the humor Martel uses throughout the story is when Pi's older brother is ridiculing Pi's many religions, saying \\"...At the rate you're going, if you go to temple on Thursday, mosque on Friday, synagogue on Saturday and church on Sunday, you only need to convert to three more religions to be on holiday for the rest of your life (70).\\" When his father breaks the news to their little humble family that they will be residing in Canada, a country totally alien to them, Pi doesn't know what to feel. His father promises them that things will be better there, but little did they know of the irony that was in store for them as the ship they're on when traveling to Canada, sinks. <br />    Just when you think it couldn't get any more complicated, it does, however, the author does a superb job keeping everything organized so the only complication is the distinction between your own thoughts and that of Pi's. This \\"simple\\" story then turns into a tale of survival in which every minute counts and human faith and will are the only remaining things keeping someone going as Pi's spends 277 days stranded on a lifeboat with a 450-pound Bengal tiger. A strange twist in the end leads the reader wondering what really happened, and what story they want to believe. <br />    I enjoyed this book from the title to the ending punctuation mark. In a world where cliché takes the best of us in all forms of entertainment, Martel has managed to steer away from that and keep surprising you with the same amount of spontaneity and energy from the firstchapter to the last paragraph. I loved how Martel makes you think in ways you've never thought of before and how he opens new doors to views and perspectives, you've never even think you'd ever come across. All in all, I highly recommend this book especially when you're extremely bogged down with the fast-paced technological world because it gives you a chance to step away from all the hustle and bustle and spend a quiet afternoon with a 15-year-old boy named Pi, a 450-pound majestic tiger, a 26 feet long lifeboat and a whole lot of water.
0679879269|5.0|The last time a book moved me, it was Dostoyevski's \\"Crime and Punishment\\". It is in the nature of good books to change the way one thinks about things. And I have changed because of this book. It is hard to express, these changes. But they are there all the same.  Perhaps its Pullman's language, for most part, there is an elegance here which I thought I have missed and never knew. There is also the time taken to describe places and people, so crisp and penetrating that I could easily see them in my mind's eye. All of this combine to make even his least important characters a gem to treasure, a friend to hold close to your heart. More than anything, Pullman managed to show me how much I have changed over the years and how little.   Yes, the book has changed me and I am greatful.

B0000E6XH3|4.0|My partner and I are big Daft Punk fans...we're not very familiar with anime in general, but bought the DVD based on the soundtrack.  We were very impressed!  The integration of music and visuals was fantastic.  Multiple viewings revealed multiple facets of the storyline.  A great piece of work.
B00005JMFO|4.0|What a great movie! My adult daughter and I went to see it and almost didn't because she considered it a \\"chick flick\\", but humored her mother. Both of us were delighted with this movie. This is one of the few movies that I have seen lately that I would actually buy. Not for small children, as there are some pretty hot scenes, but a wonderful movie for adults. Shows you that love is alive and well in all it's many fabulous forms.
B0000797IO|1.0|A friend dragged me to this movie, which will be the last time.  Long story short..Jennifer Aniston has mastered two emotions throughout the entire movie &quot;Bored and Confused&quot;.  That also describes the viewers.  The only actor with some acting ability was the young guy she had the affair with.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I didn't care for this movie at all. Boring and without much of anything to keep my interest. The only thing I liked about it were the Tokyo scenes. Otherwise, I wish I'd saved my money.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I actually began listening to Damien Rice by accident...I think his voice along with Lisa Hannigan is so beautiful, so melodic, absolutely graceful.  The best thing out of Ireland in a while:)
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I'm guessing that from all the negative reviews TOT has been given, some people just didn't want DT to show a more aggressive side. Admittedly Petrucci's solos are for the most part obnoxious (although they work well on some tracks, like This Dying Soul), but DT really serves up some excellent music on this record, a vast improvement over the very inconsistent Six Degrees.<BR>DT, who have yet to put out two records that sound the same, show some musical growth by adding a new heaviness to their songs without sacrificing their trademark oh-my-god-how-did-he-play-that-many-notes sound. James Labrie does some new Mustaine-ish like vocals at some points, and some catchy riffs (what?) are evident on the record (Endless Sacrifice). Aside from the lack of melody in Petrucci's leads, these new changes make for a strong, consistent album. I doubt DT will ever top Metropolis pt. 2, but Train of Thought is worthy of competing with Awake for a 2nd or 3rd best album.
B00008ADPF|4.0|Nickleback has been a breath of fresh air for rock fans since they came on the scene. A different sounding vocalist and some bad-ass guitars. I didn't think anything could beat Silver Side Up, however. Keep listening to this one and you will realize it does.  <BR>1. FLAT ON THE FLOOR(B): whoa! this is too fast, too strong, what kind of album are we getting into here?<BR>2. DO THIS ANYMORE(A): Now this is more like it! This song is too good to describe.<BR>3. SOMEDAY(A+): Very very good. Melodic rock we liked from the Spiderman soundtrack (on level with Hero).<BR>4. BELIEVE IT OR NOT(A):This song is beating the piss out of Silver Side. they're getting better and better.<BR>5. BECAUSE OF YOU(A): Way hard. More Nickelback than nickleback (some people will understand this).<BR>6. FEELIN' WAY TOO DAMN GOOD(A):a nice ballad as only Nickelback can do it. They've grown with their sound!<BR>7. FIGURED YOU OUT(A): Amanda Rchards &quot;Beware:Dark Content&quot; feb 7, is right. This is a darker band.<BR>8. SHOULD HAVE LISTENED(A-):it's the lyrics of this album you want to listen to here, repetative or not. Great acoustic. <BR>9. THROW YOURSELF AWAY(A): GD, this is incredible! If you like this band you will like this song. Hardcore.<BR>10. ANOTHER HOLE IN THE HEAD(B): sounding a bit like their older stuff. still good thrasher stuff.<BR>11.SEE YOU AT THE SHOW(A-): Just lay back and enjoy the closer. my favorite part is the end, and the guitar mini-solo/bridge that eludes to it.<BR>It's hard not to give this disk 5 stars. But it might not be everyone's cup of tea. I don't see the 80s meets 90s comparisons that others hear. I just hear a disk so good that I can't single out any one song being better than the other.
0671027387|3.0|If you loved The Da Vinci Code, chances are you will like this. Likewise, if you thought the DVC had shallow characters, foreseeable plot development, flaky facts, etc. you will find the same in DP. Being a conspiracy enthusiast, I thought even the conspiracies were shallow, if not highly amusing, especially the &quot;wasteful&quot; NASA and SETI vs &quot;efficient&quot; private industry. Somebody get Mr. Brown a program so he'll know which sides all the players are really on! Who do you think benefits from all the &quot;waste&quot; - most of which is highly classified? We're more than ready for an ET that looks like a giant louse, and now, thanks to Spielberg, maybe even one that looks like ET. Now there's a conspiracy!
B00006LPER|3.0|I like dark movies. This movie. Is a dark movie. I may have given the review just 3 stars but it is only for the many, many questions I had at the end of the film. The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view. The good job done by this movie is making the viewer a 'voyeur' into this woman's situation as she struggles with a man and her own mother. Another good reason why I liked the film is because of the ending. I just remember feeling so cold and depressed from the ending becuase it was something that I did not expect to happen at all. Personally this movie gave me a jilt and if your into ever watching foreign films than I recommend The Piano Teacher.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Cute movie, and it was fun to watch them filming on our campus in Fall 2002, but please *don't* accept this movie as any sort of realistic portrayal of Wellesley College!  The best part of this movie is the beautiful shots of our campus (the Galestone Tower, the Chapel interior and exterior, etc).<BR>Inaccuracies aside (and it's a BIG aside), I thought that the movie was o.k. at best.  The sub-plots with the individual students were much more interesting than the main professor-comes-to-liberate-Wellesley story.  Keep an eye out for Ginnifer Goodwin, who is excellent.  The costumes are accurate for the period, but not for everyday Wellesley wear.<BR>In the end, the movie could have been a lot better, but it probably could have been worse.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Creed is pretentious, humourless, derivative waste product diverted from a Chernobyl sewage treatement plant. Do yourself a favor - find another band with their own sound and ideas.<br />Creed = Pearl Jam for toddlers.
B0001AP12G|5.0|After Outkast fell off with Stankonia and their latest two-disc piece of crap, I was stuck in a rut without a nice album to listen to. Then, I heard that Kanye's album was hot. I picked it up and I must agree. Kanye West IS the truth... thank God that real hip-hop is back.<br />One of the most anticipated albums of the year has definitely delivered on many levels. His story is truly phenomenal and his rise to the top of the game is monumental. <br />From track 1 to track 21... you won't be disappointed. Pick this disc up now, because it's easily the year's best.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I watched this film on a 13 1/2 hour plane ride from New York to Tokyo. Having lived in Tokyo the past 20+ years I must say the film is loaded with cultural  stereotypes. Waiting for something to happen in  this  film, I wondered if the feeling  of slowness related to the plane drone or tedium of long-distance flying until I realized \\"Lost in Translation\\" does not  seem dull, it is  dull. OK there is a lot of neon glitz in \\"downtown\\" Tokyo but there's a lot in Times Square too. Do we need to shoot a couple hours of film to make the point that people are lonely or that cross-cultural experience can be challenging? I didn't get any redeeming value in this movie. I did find an excuse to go back to sleep.
B00003CXTG|4.0|The Pearl Harbor movie is a great one I'll have to admit, but practically the entire movie is pretty much a romantic one. It's almost like a soap opera with the way that people are dating other peoples pregnant girlfriend and whatnot.
B00011RPB0|5.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is director Sofia Coppola's remarkable study of the isolation and intimacy that people experience in both emotional and geographical environments. The film takes place in contemporary Tokyo where retired B-Movie actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) has come to film a commercial for a Japanese whiskey company. Harris spends his days enduring the bizarre yet entirely believable process of shooting a commercial in a country whose language and culture are completely beyond his understanding. He spends his evenings alone in the bedroom, the gym, or the bar of his lavish hotel where practically every moment seems surreal for one reason or another. In the bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has followed her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) to Tokyo where he is working on an extended project. <br />At first, Bob and Charlotte develop a casual friendship based on their mutual sense of loneliness, lack of fulfillment, and their response to the sheer oddity of their surroundings. But soon their friendship develops into a deeper sense of understanding and intimacy, and with this come new complications. Both of them are married to spouses who for one reason or another are inaccessible, Bob is much older than Charlotte, and while he has experienced financial success and built a family, she is still at a point in her life where she is young and unsure of where she is headed. Charlotte almost never sees her husband, and the few times that she does he is busy cavorting with his colleagues and clients. Bob receives regular phone calls from his wife, but they only discuss her remodeling plans for their home. <br />In the hands of an unskilled filmmaker, this situation would be ripe for all kinds of clichéd and predictable behavior. Instead, Coppola shapes their story with impressive ease and with an extraordinary understanding of the human soul. There is a lot of subtle stuff going on between Charlotte and Bob, but we never get bored or confused as their relationship develops and then conflicts arise. Similarly, despite the fact both characters are lost in Tokyo with its intense, pop-culture energy, the film never condemns or makes fun of that place. Like their personal lives, Tokyo for Bob and Charlotte is simply a space that they inhabit but in which they also feel utterly lost.<br />While \\"Lost in Translation\\" explores some very serious themes it remains a hilarious and low-key film from start to finish. I have to agree with critics or reviewers who state that this is the best role of Bill Murray's career. Johansson also delivers an extremely skilled and subtle performance. There are also many extraordinarily funny scenes in which Bob and Charlotte find themselves interacting with people or in situations that they don't understand. During many of these scenes the film pulls no punches when it comes to fully exposing some of the more bizarre and eccentric qualities of contemporary Japanese culture.  Much to its credit, however the film does this in an upfront fashion without stooping to insults or stereotypes-it's simply too honest to do that.<br />I highly recommend this film for its humor, its insight, and for the remarkable performances from Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson, and the city of Tokyo. Coppola should be highly commended for her creative genius as a director and as a screenwriter.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|First things first, I have to thank Sarah Lewitinn of Spin Magazine for turning me on to this band. She may never read this review, but if she does then she will know she was responsible for something good. Anyway..on to \\"Absolution\\". Holy %#*!, this album is a SOUL CRUSHING BEAST!!!(People that have read my reviews before know that I rarely use such hyperbole, but here it is justified.) \\"Apocalypse Please\\" is one of the best songs I've heard this year, or any year. It is a massive, rolling anthem that is just amazing to hear. I can't even think of anyone to compare it to because it would be unfair to the song. All of the instruments, guitar, piano, keyboard, rhythm section, combine to create this powerfull din that makes the song sound like it were an asteroid looking for something to annihilate. Somehow, the band is able to reproduce this effect throughout the album. You don't really have time to catch your breath either, because the next track \\"Time is Running Out\\" is stupefying as well. It see saws from medium and fast tempos with some terrific guitar playing by singer/guitarist Matthew Bellamy. You will be amazed, but it has only just begun. \\"Sing for Absolution\\" starts out slow and crystalline, but when the chorus comes around you will really take note of Bellamy's supernatural voice. Everything about this band is tremendous, but Bellamy's voice is one of the best I've ever heard. Muse has been compared to Radiohead, but I don't think that is fair to either band. The two bands have more differences than similarities. At times Bellamy's voice will invoke \\"The Bends\\" era Thom Yorke, yet overall I think Bellamy has more range and power than Yorke (no disrespect to Thom, who is great in his own regard). Muse may also be slightly more musically accessible than Radiohead. Anyway, back to the music at hand. \\"Sing for Absolution\\" is followed by the blistering Judas Priest-like guitar intro to \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" which has more terrific keyboards and vocals.(I recommend a brief intermission once this song is over to peel yourself off of the wall that you've been blown into from the first five tracks.) Halfway into the album it is obvious that these guys really know how to play their instruments. They manage to maintain their mammoth, bone rattling sound without being repetitive or cliche, and I think that the reason for this is that the songwriting is as stellar as the musicianship. The second half of the album doesn't disappoint. The volume gets turned way down for the elegant \\"Blackout\\", a lovely ballad featuring exquisite string arrangements. It is followed by the aptly titled roller coaster ride of \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\", which starts slowly before building up into a huge swell, and then descending once again into a short piano solo, and building once again into a powerful crescendo. (Now close your mouth and wipe all of that drool off of your chin.) \\"The Small Print\\" is another guitar feeding frenzy. \\"Endlessly\\" is more electronic and somewhat dance friendly, but still very good despite being a departure for the band. \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\" sounds surprisingly radio friendly despite some very haunting lyrics. \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\" is a haunting elegy with melodic piano and string arrangements. It seems to be the perfect epitath for such a powerful album, sort of like walking a half mile to cool down after running five miles. I have to say that \\"Absolution\\" is a fantastic musical experience and I will now be forced to edit my \\"Best albums of 2003\\" even though we are well into 2004. Thank you, Ultagrrrl, wherever you are.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This ablum is really great.  The lyrics really make alot of sense.  He is representing Chicago and that is great.  It is about time someone can finally get on and not be faking a lifestyle and speak the honest truth.  That is why I respect him as a lyrasist and as a producer.  He is truly a unique individual and it shows in the topics he chooses to discuss. God being one of them.  This is some great music and a great alternative to crunk music.
B0000AI45P|3.0|Tom Verlaine's voice can be shrill, Lloyd overplays on some tracks, and the rhythm section is a bit weak.  Decent guitar soloing throughout.  It's a solid record/cd, but not an irreproachable classic like London Calling, Remain in Light, or Anthem of the Sun.  They were really just trying to be the new Grateful Dead.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Incredible is what I can describe this man's life story. Here you have a concert pianist, who with his family, ends up in the Warsaw ghetto, but by one of the Capo guards pulling him out of line, Spillman was able to escape the fate of many other Jews during that time. What surprised me is the Nazi Officer's compassion towards him(probably thinking that it was too late in the game to shoot him or send him off),even to the point of giving him his coat(which almost got him shot when the Russians came to Warsaw),but still a great film just the same. I cannot compare it with Schindler's List, since I haven't seen it in its entirety, but I feel that it is worth every five and more of its stars.
B0000C8AW7|2.0|I agree with Mr. Chickeneater (see review)--Love & Theft was overhyped by the critics (as was Time Out of Mind).  It sounds a lot like 1990's Under the Red Sky, which, a few cuts excepted, isn't very good either.  And I know it's lame to complain about Dylan's voice, but it's more grating than usual here.  In an interview, the poet David Berman (also of the great band Silver Jews) talked about how he had only recently started listening to Dylan's catalog and was pretty disappointed, saying that \\"there should be someone better.\\"  I think Berman's right on target.  For all the acclaim Dylan's garnered over the years, even his best records are marred by clunkers or rewrites of older songs. The critical pendulum may have swung back in Dylan's favor, but that doesn't mean his records have gotten any better.
B00005KHJM|1.0|OK this is going to be a very short review this movie stinks.  I felt like I was ripped off. I was not scared and just don't see how so many people liked this film.  I like all types of films and art but this movie is horrible, terrible, and boring.  <br />But this is not the worst movie I have seen that distinction belongs to the classic 'Dawn of the Dead'.  So I guess if you like 'Dawn of the Dead' then you might like this one. <br />I was very disappointed with this film.
B000002VJH|4.0|The Dead put out a lot of terrible records (Go To Heaven and Shakedown Street come to mind), but some of their studio stuff is quite good and is a welcome respite from the live material.  Blues for Allah is a great record with some complex, jazzy arrangements.  Jerry's voice sounds clean and crisp, and Phil doesn't overplay his bass.  Even Donna Godchaux sounds pretty good on this one.  It plays through nice and smooth from start to finish.  I honestly think that if the band had kept developing along these lines lots of great music would have resulted.
0385504209|5.0|its hard to find a good suspense and mystery novel these days. well its hard to find one with the eloquance of dan brown who has put thought and research into the story's locations, art, and cultural aspects. even if you have never heard of opus dei before opening the book dan brown explains it in the way that everyone can understand it. the beginnings mysterious &quot;he did this to himself murder&quot; creates suspense for the famouse louve currator. i love the cultural aspects to the novel in its french point of view. &quot;what do you think of the pyramid (the one at the louve designed by im pei)?&quot; made me laugh on the french's view of their own culture. for a fan of mystery with the promise of not a plot to flop like other mysteries then dan brown presents to you a novel of greatness.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters, knowing that I didn't perticullary like the last movie.  However, this second Charlie's Angels was pathetic.  I didn't like it at all.  The plot was slow, boring, and I couldn't wait for the movie to get over with.
B00003CXC7|5.0|rear window is hitchcock's vouryism film (unless you dont remember in psycho with norman bate's peep hole in cabin 1.)where everyone is shown. the people might not know this but over all we can sense that they are being watched. James Stewart over time has made me love his acting (from vertigo, rope, and other films) where he wants to explore more but is trapped by the accident which lays him in the cast. the movie is not all a myserty in the &quot;murder&quot; but the mystery in james stewarts life (with his job and his dating situation with grace kelly). but this is over commmed by suspicon which creates this film. hitchcock wants us to see only what james stewart sees which causes the audience not to be all knowning but curious at the characters and situtations. We tremble as we see james stewart sitting in the dark in his wheelchair looking out the window trying to direct grace kelly out of the &quot;murders&quot; apartment as he re entered since she was snooping. elements like that are everlasting to films and the audience. hitchcocks film rear window is a tribute to the inner selves on how they wanna know everything and will be willing to reach it by anymeans necessary. one of the top 100 films for your collection.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Best movie ever. Saturated with sex and black comedie. Sarah Michelle Gellar totally made this movie. I think i love this film so much ive started to take on the role of Kathryn Mertuil. I recomend it to any1 who are fans of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, reese Witherspoon or Selma Bler, or enjoy the slutty, vindictive, evil, sexy side of a movie you so haft to watch it. :-)
B00013PHGS|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. I'm a big fan of their early singles and Moon Safari of course. 10000 Hz just didn't cut it for me. I thought they went in a completely different direction then what I wanted. But this one really shines. It's beautiful inventive and intoxicating.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I LOVE this film. Reese Witherspoon is a blonde goddess. This film is fresh, funny and sophistocated. Elle Woods portayes a strong female figure that anyone could look up to. I recomend this film to people of all ages (even my nan liked it) :-)<BR>Blondes rule!
B000084T18|1.0|I though Mase was bad... I'm actually beginning to like him now since 50 cent came out.  And, does he actually think he looks touch staring with that &quot;hard&quot; expression on his face?  No! He looks constipated.  Then, he smiles... he looks like a baby crapping its diaper.  He has no talent, he has only one tone to his voice and he raps so softly, you can barely understand him.  I mean, he could be rapping &quot;Do not pass go Don't collect $200&quot; and no one wouldn't notice.  In a couple of years, he's gonna fade out, like most no-talent wannabes.
B0000026J1|5.0|I appreciate this CD more now than I did when I bought the cassette when it first was released. Back then I listened more for the melodies and catchy hooks than anything. When I listen to this record now, I'm more in awe of Kee Marcello than anything else. All of his guitar solos, especially &quot;Superstitious&quot; and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; are absolutely a fascinating lesson in melody and phrasing and tonality that make it seem like the songs were written around them. It's too bad that the young beginner guitarists will never give this one a listen, (they're too into today's junk) because each solo is a lesson in song writing. Kee Marcello is a master of his instrument and is a true talent that was overlooked during the great guitarists debate during the thriving metal years.

B00011RPB0|5.0|The film is a terrific and beautiful one and I can only agree with the more profound thinkers and eloquent writers here in expressing my admiration for Sofia Coppola, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johanssen.  The cinematography is captivating and the dialogue (at only 41 minutes of a two hour film) makes you listen because of its brevity and profundity.  This film also has what I consider, truly, one of the most touching and sincere endings I can ever imagine in a film.  It will make you smile in appreciation of the gift you have received in watching this movie.<br />My ONLY complaint, though, is the DVD itself.  I have seen this echoed elsewhere, but it is worth repeating.<br />Firstly, the cover.  One does not expect very large review captions on the cover of what this hunble reviewer would consider a work of art.  Scroll to the top of page and observe the large white block running horizontally across the cover.  By my estimation, nearly a quarter of the image is review block.<br />Secondly, the cover photo has been, I think, altered.  The same photo is on the cover of the movie's soundtrack, and it shows much darker and muted tones, more in line, I believe, with the color scheme found in the film.<br />Thirdly, I was incredibly disappointed in the commercials at the beginning of the disk that cannot be skipped.  You must fast forward through them.  <br />My only hope is that the DVD was created so poorly only so the Criterion Collection can release a definitive masterwork at a later date (think Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums when thinking how high the art of the DVD can go).<br />All said, I bought the DVD its first day of release and would do so again, knowing the quality of the DVD (only its packaging, not sound or video quality).<br />A tremendous film in a lousy package.  Criterion....I wait for you.
B000084T18|1.0|I thought Mase was bad... I'm actually beginning to like him now since 50 cent came out.  And, does he actually think he looks tough staring with that &quot;hard&quot; expression on his face?  No! He looks constipated.  Then, he smiles... he looks like a baby crapping its diaper.  He has no talent, he has only one tone to his voice and he raps so softly, you can barely understand him.  I mean, he could be rapping &quot;Do not pass go Don't collect $200&quot; and no one would notice.  In a couple of years, he's gonna fade out, like most no-talent wannabes.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Hands down the sexiest album I own and have ever heard. The first time I listened to it was at the house of the girl I had just started dating and I couldn't carry on a conversation with her because I kept stopping to just listen.  It got better with ever track.  She kept talking, I kept zoning out.  And I liked the girl!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I got this album as a present and i was like &quot;Yuk not britney spears!&quot;. Well i listened to it and i took back what i said. Britney has lost her trashy pop past and has delivered and excellent R&amp;B album. BOOM BOOM is a great song with attitude and the YING YANG twins have doubled the excellence of this song. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC is another great song although Madonna does sound a little dissapointing on the song. TOXIC has a great arabian sound mixed with dance/r&amp;b. Great. Showdown is a fairly good song with a cool beat. The only let down are OUTRAGEOUS and THE HOOK UP. In short: COOL ALBUM WITH ATTITUDE.
B000062YAZ|3.0|The first time i heard this album, i felt like i'd been run over by a semi truck, and back then i felt that was a bad thing. But back then i was into &quot;melodic metal&quot; ala Maiden, Priest, and Metallica. After the first listen i promptly hid this album away swearing to never listen to it again.<br />But recently, after getting into the heavier side of metal with bands like Opeth, In Flames, and most recently Meshuggah i decided to re-visit Reign in Blood. One thing i'll give it credit for is it NEVER loses it's power and punch. I felt just as flattened the last time i heard it as the first time. And that's saying something considering how old this album is and how far metal music has advanced since.<br />First, what i like about it: <br />1) The two slow(er) tracks, Angel of Death and Raining Blood are terrific slabs of grade A metal. Awesome riffs throughout. And the two songs combined must have spawned 1000 imitators alone.<br />2) The unified vision of the albums is astounding. I wouldn't call it a concept album, because that would implicate that RiB is more intelligent than it actually is. But what it is, and what it was meant to be is 29 mins. of the most blistering extreme music every created that would mesmerize teens and scare the bejesus out of parents. And it did it's job incredibly well.<br />3) Every now and then, when i'm in the mood for the fastest, most aggresive metal possible, no album fits the bill better than Reign in Blood and i seriously doubt any ever will. The only one that comes close is Meshuggah's Destroy Erase Improve.<br />Now, what i dislike about it:<br />1) Tracks 2-9 have just as much in common with punk as with metal. Sure, they all sport metal riffs, but the sheer intensity and, for the most part, completely un-melodic-ness of them completely turns me off. Quite often King and Hanneman are just playing the open E string with downstroke/upstroke as fast as possible. And a little more variation would have helped alot. Especially considering that none of tracks 2-9 stand out at all.<br />2) King and Hanneman can't solo to save their lives. I'm a guitarist myself and most of their solos are nothing more than notes played at complete random and as fast as possible.<br />3) Araya can't sing either. His screachy voice is more irritating that scary or aggressive. And the way the vocals are arranged it's almost as if he's rapping the lyrics. But even rapping would give it a sense of groove and melodicism, but the vocals have neither and it detracts from the enjoyment alot.<br />4) The lyrics are so horrible they're laughable. But, to Slayer's credit, not many lyrics would work with this kind of music. But the whole satanic/evil imagery thing may scare parents, uptight Christians, and the weak at heart. But anyone with half a brain realizes how contrived the whole image is. To their credit they are a little more convincing than most of the so called &quot;satanic&quot; metal bands, but not much.<BR> <BR>Finally this: As where other metal bands that were kind of in Slayer's ilk come off as cheesy and unoriginal Slayer has always been the real deal. They had one speed, one mindset, one vision, and like AC/DC they stuck to it reguardless of trends. I personally can't listen to Slayer, or RiB very often. I just need more melody in my music, metal or not. But that being said, Slayer are the best at what they do, even if what they do doesn't appeal to 99% of the population.
0312263120|5.0|An intelligent thrill ride from cover to cover ... I was hooked from the very first page ... and if you like this one then your going to love Dragon Man The Adventures Of Luke Starr<BR> [...]
1565118294|4.0|this reading is excellent..save that it is abridged..why oh why?..monetary reasons i presume.  certainly they are not &quot;improving&quot; the novel.  a shame really, but still the reading is well done and brings the characters to life.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Yea, Jet sounds like a lot of past, great bands.  Listen to the whole album, and you'll hear sounds from the Stones, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Iggy Pop, AC/DC, and a host of other bands.  This album is not going to change the face or direction of Rock, and you're not going to hear much of anything new.  However, this doesn't mean that the album is not enjoyable.  It rocks, and it rocks well.  Even the slower tunes are enjoyable, which is rare for a band without its own sound.  The mix of songs plays well, seldom hitting a slow spot and causing you to skip to the next song.  And when Jet speeds up the tempo, they rock very well.  Three or four of the fast songs are automatic &quot;turn-up-the-volume-and-enjoy&quot; material, with great guitars, drums, and simple but effective lyrics.<br />Overall, I rate this album at 4 stars - well done, fun to listen to, but not a classic.
B000001IPL|5.0|This CD kicks ass. One of the best punk CD's of all-time if you ask me. I don't understand what happened to the Offspring, Americana and Conspiracy of One were only mediocre albums, i think publicity got the best of The Offspring. Smash is by far thier best CD. If you are a fan of punk, pick up this CD, if you like &quot;Original Prankster&quot; and other garbage offspring songs, buy this CD, you dont know what you are missing out on.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|One of the strangest movies ever, but fantasic. Mix together a psycho bunny, Grandma Death, cellar door, \\"Sparkle Vision,\\" time/space portals, jet engines falling out of the sky, Patrick Swayze as a preacher/child pornography freak, and quite the hooded sweatshirt obsession and you've got \\"Donnie Darko.\\" Doesn't make sense? Well, it doesn't when you watch it either, but it's great!! Highly recommend!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones' latest is really a relaxing CD with a smooth sound.  Jones' voice is as fine as ever, and the music always compliments the warm vocals.  The CD really feels like home after a two years absence.  Feeling like home means being aware of the lyrics.  The simple words are sometimes out of place when it comes to such advanced vocals and sounds.  Nevertheless, the simple lyrics are particularly successful in &quot;Sunrise&quot; and some other tracks, but don't seem to fit with other songs.<br />The voice and the music is enough to keep me listening for a long time to come.  I strongly recommend the CD.
B0000844IT|5.0|Finally!  Finally!  Finally!  An Army of Darknes edition with both the original and theatrical version.  It used to be you had to buy two different DVDs of the film so that you can have all the deleted stuff &amp; original ending and still have a version with the awesome theatrical ending.  No more of that.  Now you can have both plus a great behind the scenes documentary, theatrical trailer and comentary with this Double Disc &quot;Boomstick&quot; edition.  There's also a nice little booklet inside which is written by Ash himself, Bruce Campbell.<BR>This Edition is awesome.  Picture is great.  Sound is great.  It's all good.  I love it.
0385510438|2.0|I didn't connect with any of the characters. He didn't give me a reason to.  There was one point where I thought I might connect with Callie, but it never happened. Grisham wasn't sure where he wanted this story to go, so he rambled on for 355 pages with laws from the 70's that were or were not true; elections that I could care less about because there wasn't a reason to care; he threw in a &quot;walmart&quot; taking over the town; a nude sniper. Although I finished the book, on several occasions, I found myslef asking &quot;why am I wasting my time reading this book?&quot; A waste it is.

B000002GB9|5.0|&quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; ranks as both Styx's breakthrough and best album(alongside &quot;Pieces Of Eight&quot; and &quot;Paradise Theater&quot;)thanks to the band's progressive-rock classics &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;,&quot;Fooling Yourself(Angry Young Man)&quot;,Dennis DeYoung's theatrical title song,James Young's hard-rockin &quot;Miss America&quot;,and the anthemic &quot;Superstars&quot; as well as darker numbers like Tommy Shaw's &quot;Man In The Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Castle Walls&quot; with &quot;The Grand Finale&quot; underlying the album's theme that no matter who we are,rich or poor,&quot;deep down inside we're all the same&quot; and the so-called high life is &quot;just a Grand Illusion&quot;.If this record doesn't get your heart and soul pumped-up and ready to go,then you need a doctor.There's a reason they've been around a long time,and &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; is proof of that.Start your Styx collection with this!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I can not say enough about this movie. I just turned 33 years old and I was pretty young when I first saw this movie. As of this day, that movie still touches my heart. And there has not been a time that I watched that movie and it did not make me shed a tear. If you like musicals, dancing and a wonderful movie plot this is the movie for you. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone. This movie is definitely a 5 star movie !!!!
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Poor screenwriting is killed this show. It was a great idea with great characters but was too boring.  None of the shows were interesting enough to make you want to watch it from week to week.
0156027321|5.0|This novel has a little bit of everything: three major religions, Science Fiction in the island (I could just see that island as I read it), a tall tale or was it a dream - what is real and what is not, a story that seems unbelieveable when you hear the subject matter (living with a hungry Bengal tiger on a boat - Come On!) but then it is so believeable when you read it.  All and all a good read.  The religious aspect went over my head in parts but their is plenty online discussing this bits to explain it further if you don't understand like me.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This film seems to me to be the epitome of a Coen Brothers Film. It seems to be a rambling plot of humorous and quirky characters who are portrayed to be much greater than they really are. Jeffrey &quot;the Dude&quot; Lebowski is the main character and &quot;hero&quot; of this installment of the Coen's Filmography. He rambles on his way trying to get compensated for a rug that was peed on by some pornographer's goons.<BR>Everything he does to try and remedy the situation seems to be a complete wrong turn and everything about the man is kind of in shambles, but it really does seem to have a feeling of humanity to the character. The Coens have indicated that &quot;the Dude&quot; is loosely based on a friend of theirs who has been known to rant about how his rug &quot;ties the room together,&quot; while Jeff Bridges seems completely at home in the uber-slacker role of playing Jeff Lebowski.<br />Great characters, humorous story, more silly plot twists than I can even refer to, this is one of my favorite simple pleasures movies. The Dude abides and so does this movie. Check it out...
0802130208|5.0|This novel should get more attention in High School reading programs - it will teach a lot about character developement.  Additionally, it will teach kids now a days that reading is fun and can be funny.  They are making it into a movie which should increase the popularity of this novel.  Who will play the main character?  I wonder if Oprah will pick it for her classics reading group.  I would love to see that show.  Can't wait for the movie - should be wickedly funny - if done right.
0452282152|5.0|Just as some paintings leave you stunned and awed by their beauty, so does this book Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier.  I couldn't put it down.  It is a beautiful story, one you will not regret having read.
0375704027|5.0|The best love story I have ever read.  All of Murakami's works are excellent but this is his best.  If you haven't read him then buy this book now - excellent - you will not put it down until you are down with it.  Don't get me wrong Anna Karenina is a great novel and a classic by any degree but this novel is just a little better.
B00011RPB0|4.0|This is a movie about how hard it is to ever really connect with people, beause communication is difficult if not impossible.  Words are too unstable and there are too many other things going on.  Both of the main characters feel lost; they try to communicate this to loved ones, but can't get through.  Everyone is too busy and there's nothing really wrong, nothing one can talk about.  They feel they have lost touch not only with their loved ones, but also with the world in general.  Ms. Coppola knows what she is doing and executes her theme well.  Tokyo, because it is such a fast-paced, confusing, foreign place, is the perfect spiritual location for these two lost people who somehow manage to connect.  It is not through action or words; they never do anything momentous and only occasionally say anything out of the ordinary.  Connection is a miracle; trying to analyze or explain it would ruin it.  The final moment of the movie is one character whispering something to the other; even the audience is left out of their communication, their connection, and it is appropriate, even poignant. It's pretty impressive that someone can even make a movie about such a thing without ruining it.
0452282152|5.0|If you have read Tracy Chevalier before then start with this novel.  It is her best work.  The Virgin Blue is good but not as good as this book is.  Wow - creating a whole story out of just looking at a painting.  I can imagine how Tracy's kids bedtime stories must be - amazing is what I am thinking.  Tell me a story mom and then here comes this elaborate tale.
0817221883|5.0|When I first picked up Pride and Prejudice a few years ago, I was quickly put off by the seemingly apparent silliness of its characters and their mentality. When I came back to it during sophomore year, this time with more patience and a better-developed reading background, I came to realize what each character contributed to the story. Focused on a middle-upper class family of five daughters and their parents, this classic ingeniously sets forth two very real aspects of any society.  From the flighty whim evident in its characters to the materialistic but true-for-this-world values presented, this book manages through drama and romance to reveal a hidden emphasis on pride and prejudice.<br />The first character the reader is acquainted with is Mrs. Bennet, who throughout the story is hell-bent on getting her daughters wed to wealthy - and only wealthy - husbands. In her one sees a sole, materialistic priority of reputation and wealth as if besides getting her daughters married and rich there is nothing else. Funny how it seems to me, may I add, that this kind of doggedness reflects a common Chinese goal in my society that besides getting into a top top college there is nothing else!<br />The sisters of Jane Bennet's interest, Mr. Bingley, also display such a prejudice in terms of money. On top of such prejudice the sisters also display a prideful superiority over others of society. They place themselves above all others; this is reflected in their opposition of their brother marrying Jane - the Bingley sisters find Jane's manners `charming' but scoff at her middle class background. Such pride is most evidently seen in Mr. Darcy, a character whom rarely seems to converse with others as if his breath should not be wasted thus.<br />What I liked best about this book, however, was something I did not begin to realize until halfway into the book. I found that the ingenuity of Pride and Prejudice lies in that while the reader sides with Liz Bennet, the reader gradually realizes that in disdaining others' pride and prejudice she herself becomes one of the most prideful and prejudiced characters in the book! The novel is clever in its saying that pride and prejudice, no matter how well aware we are of it, is always present in each one of us.
0140177396|5.0|The greatest American Author in my opinion and this is his greatest work.  It applied to society then, now and into the future.  Excellent read, excellently written, and the kind of novel I like fiction but thought provoking.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I am not a comic book person so when my room-mate rented Daredevil I almost didn't watch it, but I did and the love story was so much better than I thought at first. I didn't even think there would really be one. I liked it, but I can't believe how sad everything turned out. There's a hint that things aren't as bad as they seem so that's helpful I guess, but I still want a happy ending. Ben and Jen...Garner not the other one...are cute together and make a great couple. If only all comicbook movies were like this. I rate this 3 1/2 stars because I want a happier ending so make a sequel already.
B00005JMCN|3.0|A fleeting moment in the passing of film history. Too overshadowed by the greatness of the book. While most people remember Return of the King , Lost in Translation, and Mystic River being the best  of 2003, Seabiscuit will only be held as a sentimental sports movie (like Rocky except without the uplifting end that wasn't a happy ending). It has it's merits but is very mediocre considering the artistic triumphs of this year. If you thought Forrest Gump was the movie of the century,  didn't get a minute of Pulp Fiction, or thought the love story in Titanic was a real portrait of romantic love then I would recommend this. But if you tolerate movies with subtitles, thinks that subtleness is not a bad thing, and hate being emotionally spoonfed, then I would recommend you stay far away from this. 3-Stars for the effort and the fact that I was entertained for most of it.
6304366086|5.0|One of the best racing movies of all time.<BR>The racing footage is the best.
B000099T2L|2.0|When I first listened to this album, the first thing that popped into my mind was Ashanti. This album was filled with her &quot;oversinging&quot; over hip-hop beats that weren't really that good. Don't get my wrong, I love Beyonce, I was with her through their first album, to The Writings On The Wall, all the way to Survivor, but she really disappointed me with this album. I think it was more of a album made for a debut artist, not a veteran like Beyonce.<br />First off I expected less features. I feel like a great artist does not need a rapper spitting 16 bars on their track to make it hot. Beyonce had Jay-Z on 2 tracks, Big Boi from Outkast, Sean Paul and the legend Luther Vandross on her album. NO! You should not need all those superstars to make a great album. Ashanti made a great album with just Ja Rule on her album on 1 song and that song didn't even need him and probably would have been better without him. NO FEATURES BEYONCE!<br />Now the variety. I just feel like every song sounded the same. I have no problem with artist sampling because people making a big deal out of artist sample is just crazy but having an album full of slow songs just won't do it. There was one fast song and it was Crazy In Love. The next 2 Naughty Girl and Baby Boy are ok dance songs. The rest are just songs that you sit back and zone out to. I wasn't feeling that. Straight RnB and slow songs aren't going to cut it. Do what Ashanti did, Ashanti has Pop, RnB, Ballads, Slow Songs, and Old School on her album. Beyonce where is all that on your album??? MORE VARIETY!<br />I'm comparing this album to Ashanti's Chapter 2 and honestly saying that you should go spend your $15 on Ashanti and not Beyonce. Truthfully, this was just another typical debut RnB album and the problem with that is Beyonce is not new and she's always been better than &quot;typical&quot;. Her music with DC was always something hot, new and original, and Dangerously In Love lacked all of that! In the eyes of someone whoactually knows real music and compares the music to the artist, I feel like this album was not worthy of the albums sales, the awards, or even baring Beyonce's name on it. Big disappointment.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I never was much of a follower of Rage or Soundgarden myself. I knew some of their work and liked some of it, so I didn't have too many expectations from this Super-Band resulting of the blend of Cornell (Soundgarden) and most of Rage's musicians. I was blown away, after a couple of listens: that is one thing, the album doesn't sink in the first time you check it out, because it runs on a track different from most of rock music out there right now.<br />I would say the closest sound I can think of to describe how they sound like is early Pearl Jam, so this is to say that AudioSlave, with the combination of a well crafter guitar work on top of a solid rhythm line, with Cornell's thoughtful vocals and singing, is on the right track: they project a lot of strength, and while they can get to be a bit repetitive at times (several songs have a very similar musical structure to them), when they are able to change gears, their work can exude brilliance, such as the case of songs like &quot;I am the Highway&quot;, &quot;Getaway Car&quot; and the closing track.<br />So, why 4.5 stars and not 5? The repetition here and there. Given what they show on this album, we now all know that they have &quot;it&quot;: it's just a matter of letting it come out throughout future albums. In sum, I am happy to hear some solid rock music in a time where most of the music in rock and pop is quite lacking much originality and power (with a few exceptions, such as White Stripes).
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Amazing, really. Who would have thought that prog metal could sink so low? So, here's TOT, the latest in a long series of so-and-so or just plain bad (take your pick) DT CD's. Nothing much to say about it really. When I bought it in November, I thought it was just awful, but I kept at it and it slowly grew on me (sort of) to become something of a 2-star effort. I'm writing this review after listening to it again for the first time in two months, and it sure has lost its two stars since them. I've been trying to find some redeeming quality (I mean, SFAM was overblown and cheesy, but some songs were nice for a time, before the fillers and the useless need to turn a perfectly good 6-minute song into a 12-minute taste in boredom just because so many people equate long with progressive finely got the better of me), but I'm afraid I just can't. As with 6 Degrees, this is the pits, really. The burnout continues. There is not a single good song in this, and I'm not sure they're even a band any longer! John Myung is kind of never there, out a silly prog notion that bass shouldn't be heard (why have a bass player at all, then?). Jordan Rudess is equal to what he's done on his earlier work with DT, which means that he sounds like a session player added later on in the mix with only a few keyboard lines here and there, only more so than usual. Mike Portnoy is okay, although he tends to sound the same on every DT CD. And then, there's John Petrucci. Because, as much as I'd care to think of it as a group effort, TOT sounds so much like a guitar album that you have to wonder whether Petrucci didn't write the songs alone (except for Vacant) then add his pals later on. I wouldn't mind that, usually, except that his playing has never sounded more boring. Even the people who rated this 5 stars say it: there is not a single interesting guitar line on the whole album. Don't misunderstand me, the guitar is everywhere, it just does nothing special. There is no memorable solo, no melody that gets you humming despite yourself, just--nothing. James LaBrie is the only ray of light, here, as he sounds much better than on some other CD's. Nothing much he can do to save this sinking ship all by himself, though.<br />Also, the thing I don't understand is the direction they chose. They wanted to make a metal CD. Okay, I respect that. But why ape material that is 20 years old, for God's sake? I mean, they're always borrowing from other bands' repertoires, but doing some earlier-era Metallica in 2003 is just plain ridiculous. In case you don't know, metal (prog, power or mainstream) has evolved quite a bit since then, guys. In fact, it has been undergoing a furious revival for the last few years, and all the great bands come from Sweden or Finland, so you might want to check them out, next time. I could name a dozen of them at the drop of a hat, and compared to them, TOT sounds mediocre at best. Add to that the fact that the technical side of DT is also missing and the result if very glum indeed (to get back to the Swedes, just check Andromeda's &quot;Extension of the Wish&quot;--I'm not really a fan, but you'll see that, although not yet 25, Johan Reinholdz is every bit the guitar player John P. wishes he were).<br />For several years, I'm felt that the biggest problem with DT (aside from Kevin Moore leaving the band) was that they hit their peak too early. They were at the top in 1989 (when they wrote Metropolis part I and A Change of Seasons), released a cracker of an album (Images &amp; Words) in 1992 and another very good one (Awake) in 1994. But it all went downhill from there. The most amazing thing is that Queensrÿche also died in 1994 (after Promised Land, which remains, in my opinion, they best album ever) and I've long since given up on them. Don't know why I kept trying so long with DT, especially since, looking back, Queensrÿche have more good/great CD's to their catalogue than DT, IMHO. Don't think I will any longer, though.<br />As an aside, if you're into power metal, I just took a chance and bought Last Tribe's (from... Sweden) &quot;The Uncrowned&quot;, and they're great. You might wish to check them out. Sure, it's slightly heavier than TOT, but so much more melodic (and not really less prog, except for the length of the songs--but then, I'd rather have ten good songs than seven bad ones any day!).<br />(Oh, and if you have a minute, I would also recommend checking rnadir's review on TOT (it's called &quot;Hitting the Buffers&quot; and is featured in amazon.co.uk spotlight reviews). It's accurate, straight to the point, and funny, too. Hats off, rnadir!)  :-)
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Marketed as a PG movie for the entire family (with the obligatory Shrek-based candy and toy tie-ins), Shrek has some rather significant problems trying to inhabit that particular demographic.<br />Shrek centers around a big green ogre in a fairy tale world (the film cleverly borrows from many Grimms tales, and sprinkles elements of them around this world).  A lonely soul, Shrek is ostracized and feared by the rest of the fairy tale creatures -- so he lives a solitary life in his swamp.  <br />That is, until the other fairy tale creatures are driven off their property by the devious (and diminutive) Lord Farquad, and onto Shrek's property.  Shrek cuts a deal with Farquad in an effort to reclaim his property:  If Shrek can rescue the Princess Fiona from the dragon and deliver her to Lord Farquad to be the Lord's bride, then Shrek will get his swamp back, all to himself.<br />So he sets off on his quest, with a talking donkey (played by Eddie Murphy) in tow.<br />OK, so far, so good.  Clever entertainment that is fun for kids, and sharp and witty enough for adults to enjoy.  But then things start getting ugly.  The underlying premise (or message, if you prefer) of this movie is tolerance of those who are different.  The movie is trying to say, &quot;It doesn't matter what's on the outside -- it's what is in the heart that matters.&quot;  Shrek is a big ogre, but he is simply misunderstood, and people need to see him beyond his looks and accept him for what he really is.<br />A noble message for kids, right?  But the movie completely undercuts these lofty goals and obliterates all of its legitimacy with its depiction of Lord Farquad.  See, the Lord is a &quot;little person.&quot;  He is very short.  So, the movie spends a great deal of time making fun of the Lord's height deficiency -- thereby betraying its central theme of tolerance and the &quot;looks don't matter&quot; ethos.<br />If this weren't bad enough, the short jokes don't stop at the Lord's body height.  No,they continue on to make references to his apparent shortness in the, well, &quot;private area.&quot;  Hollywood being Hollywood, they just couldn't resist putting these references into the film to give it &quot;edge&quot; (&quot;edge&quot; being the Hollywood term for &quot;crudity&quot;).  The Lord's castle itself is in the shape of a phallic symbol.  The Lord gets stiff while gazing at a picture of the princess.  And the characters in the movie have quite a few smirking chuckles at the expense of the Lord's height and presumed lack of, er, prowess.<br />So much for clearly getting its &quot;message&quot; across to kids.<br />On top of all that, the talking donkey says a few non-kiddie words.<br />I really dislike this kind of movie.  It's the kind of movie that has so much good stuff going for it, so much cleverness (the references to familiar Grimms fairy tales are a kick), and such great production values (the computer graphics are stunning), that it is just an absolute shame that it has to be ruined by unnecessary crudeness.  (But I guess every Mike Myers movie has to have at least a few crude male anatomy jokes in it, huh?)  <br />On the surface, this movie has a lot going for it.  But after all of the computer graphics wizardry, clever fairy tale gags, and so on, it ultimately comes down to what it always comes down to:  the Story.  In this case, the creators of this film betrayed the premise of the movie just for the sake of a few crude chuckles.  Par for the course these days, I guess.  But it's too bad.  This could have been a GREAT G-Rated movie, and would still be chock-full of witty humor, a la any good Pixar movie.  But no.  Too bad indeed.
B000068OCS|4.0|It is hard to believe this movie is already over 20 years old. I remember seeing it on the big screen when it was first released. It was an unexpected experience to say the least. At the time, this movie left a strong impression on me, not simply a particular image or sequence, but rather the duality of the images and music. That duality is inherent throughout this movie; an observation made only on repeated viewing.<br />There is the obvious nature vs technology duality. In parallel, this duality can be expressed as god-made vs man-made. There are the old world vs the new world, Hopi cave drawings vs high-tech cinematography and music (the movie we are watching), communication by drawing with coal vs television commercials, ocean waves swelling and receding, cities rising and falling, deserts eroding while factories assemble cars and package massive amounts of food, insurpassable terrain and numerous roads, cars, and airplanes, the slow tide of nature and the fastlane happening all at once.  And in the midst of these dual forces is man, a product of the natural world creating the technological world. It is rather like the yin and yang, yang the primary color at present. Technology has usurped first place in defining the world around us and nature is merely a prelude. We are increasingly defined by our technological achievement rather than by our nature. We are gradually defined by our creation, perhaps as god is defined by us. Yet echoes of nature pulse within the concrete fortresses of our technolgy. The roads are like arteries pumping red and white cells to and fro, the factories generate food to help us survive, we record our deeds on film for posterity (the very movie we are watching is a testament of sorts),and we aspire to break free of gravity's tethers reaching for whatever lies ahead.<br />The director claims that this movie is meant to be a journey without making any value judgment. I believe we should take him at his word. Man is depicted becoming ruledby his own creation and neglecting, even destroying, his creator. It is never confirmed that this is a bad thing, but the implication is that balance between the natural and technological worlds is inevitable. Even the old world is fading, eroding away like the deserts, monument valley a cemetery of the ancient world. A day of judgment so to speak is in the making and technology will be forced to reckon with nature one way or another. People, despite their technological prowess will buckle under nature's creative supremacy and the inescapable cycle of creation and destruction. The Hopis understood this cycle and predicted an end to koyaanisqatsi. Of course, the Hopis are victims to the cycle themselves.<br />The media is the massage wrote Marshall Macluhan.  Koyaanisqatsi is an excercise of this idea.  The images and music move us, affect our perceptions of the world and ourselves on some level.  On a global scale, media is inseparable from everyday life and from our collective consciousness. Via images and sounds we are moved to act, and society moves along.  The cave drawings were the media-massage for the Hopis.  Koyaanisqatsi is our high-tech cave drawing. The Hopis idols are destroyed slowly with the desert, our idols will be destroyed in due time.  The only thing that never changes is change itself ... This seems to be the central theme of this movie, despite assertions there is no central theme.<br />Overall I like this movie. But, I think that Godfrey Reggio failed to create a balanced artistic statement. He says the movie is not an indictment of technology and I can see that he attempted an earnest effort to make a balanced statement. Nevertheless, my gut reaction (and many others' as well) when viewing this movie is \\"what are we doing, what are we thinking, where are we going?\\"  There is an element of misanthrope in this movie that is unmistakeable and largely responsible for the \\"environmentalist\\" interpretation of the movie so popular among many viewers.This is because Mr. Reggio, in my opinion, didn't quite pull off what he intended. If he had, he wouldn't need to explain his intention or his method in interviews and essays. You never heard Stanley Kubrick explaining 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br />Regarding the format controversy I have only one comment to make.  See this movie whatever the format.  After you see it then argue which format is better.  I have seen both the 1.33:1 and 1.85:1 versions.  They are both good; my preference is wide rather than tall and this DVD is quite good.
B0000C23DO|5.0|The Rhino/Warner Brothers compilation &quot;The Very Best of The Grateful Dead&quot; is the first to span the band's entire career in a single disc. It is also the first Dead compilation to encompass material from different record labels. So not only is the Dead's formative years with Warner Bros. covered, material from Arista and United Artists labels are also included.<br />This CD includes the Grateful Dead's most commercial material and its best known hits such as the signature classics &quot;Truckin'&quot;, &quot;Uncle John's Band&quot;, &quot;Box Of Rain&quot; and &quot;Ripple&quot; as well as their only top 40 smash &quot;Touch Of Grey&quot; from 1986.<br />Elsewhere are Deadhead favorites such as &quot;Estimated Prophet&quot;, &quot;Franklin's Tower&quot;, &quot;Fire On The Mountain&quot; and &quot;U.S. Blues&quot;.<br />This is only one side of The Grateful Dead. The bands other side is what they are better known for - extended jams. Unfortunately &quot;The Very Best Of&quot; does not capture the bands improvisational and experimental side. It does however display the Dead's diverse range and their ability to craft radio-friendly material flawlessly and effortlessly.<br />This compilation is highly recommended for beginning Deadheads who'd like to hear the more commercial side of the band. For their improvisational side, &quot;Live/Dead&quot; is an excellent place to start. For their more experimental work, check out &quot;Anthem Of The Sun&quot;, &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; or &quot;Blues For Allah&quot;. These albums as well as this compilation provide a well-rounded textbook for those starting their collection of Dead recordings.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|As a large fan of this series, I believe the first season was one of the best and a must-see, must-buy for any fan. The first season of Gilmore Girls was the most charming of them all, like many other shows, it set a high standard for its following seasons. <br />Many good things about the first season was that the viewers almost saw the lives of the Gilmores as if they'd been a part of it. The show developed the story in a clear way that there was no confusion or \\"catching up\\", but instead you could follow along with the witty dialogue and enjoy it's originality.<br />Many good characters came with the first season (Luke, Tristan, Dean, Babette,etc.), and it was good to see the characters develop.<br />Everything was new in this season, Rory first started at Chilton, the prestigious prep school; Lorelai, Rory, Richard, and Emily finally were able to come together as a family; Rory met her first boyfriend; and all in all the brilliance just radiated from the scripts. The cast was perfectly chosen, and when watching the episodes their performances provide some of the best talent seen on television.<br />This would be a great purchase for anyone who's a fan or who wants to catch up on the old times. I would highly recommend buying this DVD set.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Who would of thought the savior of hip hop was hiding since jay's dynasty vol.4?  With all the 50 cent,g unit,cash money robots that talk about cash, cars, and chicks kanye west is a breath of fresh air.  This IS hip hop and lucky for rockafella to produce such a talented producer and rapper. I agree with all the reviews that call kanye a breath of fresh air to the rap game but he is no tupac but quite possibly could be the best thing since tupac. I'm raving about this so much just because i've never heard any real hip-hop, I listen to all the mainstream.  When I first heard this I was thinkin....what the hell is this? Then I realized I was listening to actual hip hop...it took some getting used to.  Everything about is perfect but what stands out the most is the lyrics.  I don't think he mentions cars, money, or hoes in any of his songs, in fact he mentions jesus in alot of his songs (which I give kanye the most props for) Even the skits, although many, are frickin funny. Please though, don't bootleg his cd, support kanye by buying his cd because he deserves it. Any amount of money you pay for this is worth it. Kanye West could truly be the replacement for Jay-Z.
B00009W0U4|4.0|I have heard about this movie for about a year and half before it opened in Australia and was eagerly anticipating to see it. The night before I watched it, I had a dream that Monica was lying half naked on a couch. She looked blissfully asleep but I knew that she was hurt on the inside. Damaged by someone. So, it was hard to see this beautiful actress playing the rape victim compared to her other roles where she was always the seductress. It has been five days now and that 10 minute rape scene still haunts me. Rape, whether it lasts 10 seconds or 10 minutes is excruciating for everyone and for an actress to portray the victim, she deserves ultimate respect. When I watched Ireversible, I did think that it has been overrated. But it slowly occurred to me that Noe's depiction of life's dark side with its most disgusting and brutal effects is to leave a permanent stain and people who have experienced this can never erase the memory. Directed in reverse Memento style, it is like looking into someone's mind who has been traumatised and thinking if only everything could be turned back to a more happier beginning. If only Marcus had left with Alex at the party so that she never had to use the under passage. Or if Marcus and Pierre had not hunted down and killed the wrong man for Alex's rape. And then it also shows that when tragedies happen, damages are done and they can not be fixed but eventually time will erase them. There are elements of this movie that will haunt every viewer. The very bleak, shaking and thumping opening scenes leaves either a lot or nothing to the imagination and it is this open interpretation that makes this movie so attached to people's mind long after it has ended. The comparison of Marcus' womanising and childish behaviour is about as bad as the rapist, it is an emotional abuse that is followed by physical and psychological abuse. Pierre's merciless violent killing defies his earlier pacifist behaviour. It must be said that everyone, Cassel, Dupontel, Prestia and especially Bellucci had tough roles that they semi improvised and they were gut wrenching decisions to make from the moment they chose to be in this movie. Many would prefer not to see Irreversible (again) to hide away from life's tragedies but to see it again would definitely remind us that life is also beautiful and that there are certainly things and people that we should not take for granted and do whatever we can to protect and hold onto them for as long as we can because eventually time will erase them as well.
0446608955|4.0|This splendid novel written by Nicholas Sparks has once again taken my heart utterly after the Message in the Bottle(by Nicholas Sparks as well). While YOU may regard this book simply as another sticky romance story, I read it and was on my knees crying for the saddest and most sensational outcome of the story. <BR>Nicholas Sparks wrote this story as though as he is telling a tale; its casual and gives a sense of etherealness. He casually leads the reader through the sceneries and to a point of climax where the Landon Carter decides to marry the love of his life Jamie Sullivan who is also dying from leukemia. This book is inevitably the most tear-earning novel I have ever read followed by Message in the Bottle. The greatest lesson I learned from this book isnt the heroic sacrifices for love, but from the character Jamie Sullivan. She loves life and tried to live her last bit of life to the fullest. Her passion for life is the greatest lesson for all of us. Jamie is the most cheerful person that I have ever known; she is so cheerful that it almost seems saintly and ethereal. She possesses the greatest affinity with people that I have ever seen. Jamies entire life was a misunderstanding for everybody. This thought-to-be-eccentric girl ended up loved and felt sympathetic towards to by everyone.<BR>After reading this heart-reaching novel by Nicholas Sparks, I put the book down and went up to my parents to tell them how much I love them. Yes, this is how magical this novel is. It leads you to a realization of how temporary things can be, and thus having the urge to show your love and passion in every possible way. Read this novel and find out the amazing things it could do to you!
0679441018|2.0|I began reading the book with an open mind - I'd read some bad reviews.  In fact, the first - third? - of the book was very good.  It seemed Rice had got her gay erotica under control, and the story was going great.  I mean, Lestat meets someone claiming to be the Devil?  Sounds like a great idea to me!  But then, we reach the part when Lestat actually goes with Memnoch, and we find ourselves on completely different ground.  Rice uses Memnoch as a way to re-write the Bible and create her own religion: Riceism.  Arguments about God, what happened, how the earth was formed - basically, history and religion mashed together in one great big science class.  Die-hard Anne Rice fans may be able to make it through the book, but I gave up about 2/3 of the way through, feeling very disappointed.  Lestat and/or vampire fans beware; MEMNOCH THE DEVIL is nothing more than Anne Rice's version of the Bible.  My verdict: you ain't gettin' no hallelujahs from me.
B000088E6D|5.0|An electrifying show on Valentines Day at the Borgata Hotel &amp; Casino. Buble held the audience captive throughout, he personifies showmanship and vocal perfection.<br />I rushed out to by this CD and it's even exceeded my now super high expectations. Producer David Foster has assembled a renowned team of musicians, arrangers and producers and the results are worldclass.<br />The CD is long (13 great songs) but flys by. Buble's voice takes on a full range of beautiful sounds, none better than <BR>You'll never find another love like mine. <BR>Crazy little thing called love has so much energy its catchy as could be.<BR>All in all this is a terrific CD and captures you from song one!
0876855575|5.0|I won't bore you with a full detailed explaination of the book or gush for line upon line about how great it is. This book nor the author don't need it. I will just simply say he is absolutly fantastic, a sheer joy to read!! Everyone should try him once.. I say once because the first time will be all that it takes to make you a fan!!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I know there are some that were scratching their heads over this film. Probably because it lacked a recognizable plot formula and a Hollywood ending. But this movie was independent from the start (despite Murray and Coppola's involvement)and its beauty and honesty stuck with me for days. I watched it twice in one sitting which I rarely do.  <br />Murray was incredible. An actor in his prime and a comic that is so subtle and human. He is a master at his art and has hit his stride, but what impressed me even more was Sofia Coppola's writing and direction. Her dialogue was spot on. For a young woman she is wise beyond her years. She pegged both main characters and it was so real at times that I forgot it was a movie. Sure the scenes were hit and miss in their portrayal of Tokyo life. But the subject matter is so overwhelming that one expects that result. I was mesmerized and inspired. The last scene was so emotional that I lost it. How many of us could relate to that scene and the build up that led to it. Amazing.
B0000DJZ9T|1.0|If you think you'll be watching a concert, you'll be disappointed. This is not a concert. This is the result of an MTV era. It's the classic cut and cut until you see nothing. The typical lack of talent for filming a concert. It seems nowadays they don't know how to film a concert anymore. The band is great as usual but a concert on DVD is supposed to be just that. A concert! Not a video-clip! Why would I watch that? I just play the CD.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Yeah, like I said, I'm lovin the joint...this album is what &quot;hip-hop&quot; needed.  But of course due to his lack of gangsta notoriety, it really won't get the love 50 may, but hands down, hottest all around album of the century...yep already!!!
B00018D44U|5.0|First of all I just have to say one thing--all the promotional material on this album stated it was going in a more country direction.  If you don't want a country album don't buy one that is advertised as country.<BR>That being said there is very little true country on this album.  It is DEFINATELY Texas music, however that is not in and of itself Country music.  Most of this album would fall under an unbrella called Americana, which is music rooted in folk, blues, rock, folk and country.  You would never hear this album played on the same station as Shania Twian and Tim McGraw--you wouldn't even find it played on the same stations as Alan Jackson and Reba McEntire.  You would (and do) find it played on the same stations as Kasey Chambers, Tift Merritt, Mindy Smith and Kathleen Edwards.  If you have never heard of any of those people it is entirely possible you won't like this album.  However, if you like any one or more of them, this album will be right up your alley.  (If you like this album and haven't heard of them, give them a try.)  <BR>If this album has a flaw it is that she tries to stick too closely to the sound of Come Away With Me, presumably to keep from alientating her fanbase.  She really doesn't need to.  The majority of the people who listen to her--the ones who would have found her without MTV and the Grammies--would be perfectly comfortable with her growth.
0064407667|1.0|I bought this book at my children's school book fair after reading some of the reviews here. I believed from the text on the book jacket that there must be something delightful and darkly humorous about these books. Unfortunatly all I found was a thin plot line, some rather intellgent but somewhat clueless children, and conniving relative with muderous intents. Also he and his friends have some veiled \\"desires\\" towards the oldest teenage daughter.<br />I see no true value to this book, other than an excellent writing style and an excellent vocabulary. I for one will not let my children rea
B00003CXZ4|2.0|WARNING! SPOILERS! =P<BR>I don't really know why, but I really didn't like this movie at all. A friend said it was so great and so I decided to see it... but then I actually watched it. In addition to making very little sense to me (i had to have most of it explained over time), I didn't really understand the point of it.<br />Okay, so you have some guy who has a case of perpetual memory loss. And he kills some people because he gets mad... So? Am I supposed to like him as a character, or feel bad for him? The guy gets mad at some guy because he thinks he's lying and so he ends up killing him according to a little note he writes on himself.<br />I don't find the characters likable, nor do I find them particularly memorable. The plot is lacking, and the movie's focus limited to a boring monotony. It's about betrayal, and stupid ways that people mess each other up...eh. The only reason I give it more than one star is because it's an okay idea for a film.<br />I guess it's also that I was reccommended this movie by someone who said it was so amazingly great, and I wasn't particularly impressed with it. Had I seen it without hearing about how great it was, maybe I'd like it better... I dunno... hype always seems to ruin movies. =P
B0001AP12G|5.0|&quot;Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin significant/ but now I'm rappin bout money, hoes and rims again...&quot; - Breathe In Breathe Out<br />Kanye West has produced songs for some of the biggest acts in hip-hop and r&amp;b, but can he carry an album by himself? Hell Yes!!! The College Dropout is unique because it successfully encompasses the full range of the human experience. Kanye offers an album that is at times both complex and contradictory, but always soulful. Many have already heard the singles &quot;Through the Wire&quot; and &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;. But these singles only scratch the surface of who Kanye West is as an artist. Kanye can effortlessly make a song about his savior in &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; but on the other hand ask Talib Kweli to help him get women on &quot;Get Em High&quot;. But what makes Kanye appeal to a wide audience is his ability to relay the experience of the blue-collar worker. Kanye humorously gives tribute to the educated unemployed in &quot;School Spirit&quot; as well as the frustration of go-nowhere jobs in &quot;Spaceship&quot;. Kanye can also illustrate the irony of the self-conscious in &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, identifying the hopeless pursuit of materialism and yet be a victim to it himself. A few of the many gems on this album are &quot;All Falls Down, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Two Words&quot;. <br />While Kanye's producing skills are impeccable, he still has some room to grow as an MC. While his flow may not be on the level of Jay-Z or Eminem, Kanye succeeds as an MC because he's so honest with his lyrics. Check out the lyrics on the masterful &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; where Kanye's raw emotion allows him to upstage the lyrical brilliance of Jay-Z:<br />&quot;Nothing as sad as that day my girl father passed away/ So I promise to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter/ And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up/ And I know that you was smilin when you seen the car I boughther/ And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up...&quot; - Never Let Me Down<br />In summation of the College Dropout, Kanye West delivers quite simply the best &quot;soul&quot; album of the millenium and one of the most ambitious debuts in hip-hop history. And as Kanye continues to hone his skills as an MC to complement his producing genius, he can single handedly bring the style and innovation back into hip-hop music. While 2004 will bring new albums from rap heavyweights such as Eminem and 50 Cent, there will not be a more important hip-hop album this year than Kanye West's the College Dropout.
B00018D44U|3.0|Maybe it's been too overhyped and maybe the expectations were sooo high that they'd never be reached.  Nonetheless, it's a decent album.  It's what I would call &quot;nice&quot;.  <br />It's stuff you could put on in the background, stuff you could put on and take a nap to, stuff you could play for your mother, stuff your girlfriend might even like.<br />That said, it's not really that much different than the first one, which again was just &quot;nice&quot;.  Her voice is still smooth as can be; it soothes me to sleep at times.  The songs just aren't all that memorable; I've been through it a couple times and can't recall any absolute-must-listen-to-standouts.  <br />So buy it, hopefully cheap, because, yes, it is nice. Just don't expect to hear the reinvention of music on this cd.
B00001PE4D|1.0|I've seen different versions of &quot;The dangerous liaisons&quot;, and with difference this the worst one I've ever seen. The version with Keanu Reeves, Michelle Pfeiffer and John Malkovic it's the best one. Ryan Phillippe is as bad actor as gross, not to mention Reese Whitherspoon. All they do it's a free version of the book, it's another movie starred by the &quot;Bloof generation&quot; of actors we have right now, if you have dignity yet, don't see it.
0385504209|1.0|I think 1 star is a little bit too high a rating for this book that is a non-stop sermon on the merits of Goddess Worship.  We are told in the beginning that all of the facts are accurate.  Really, Mr. Brown, you couldn't find one real source to list for your gullible readers in a bibliography?  We are expected to ignore 4500 manuscripts of the New Testament pre-dating Constantine, just because your make believe Harvard professor tells us to trust him?  I hope your readers who have no previous knowledge of church history will be led to begin educating themselves.  I would suggest A Case For Christ by Lee Strobel, or The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict by Josh McDowell; two good historians rather than a novelist with an agenda.  Reading from their list of source materials will keep one busy for years and hopefully away from trash like The Da Vinci Code.  I would also recommend C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity; there is a real Oxford University professor for you.  Funny how the fictitious professor never does find the evidence that everyone, even supposedly the big bad church knows exists.  I'm waiting for the sequel, Mr. Brown.
0385504209|3.0|The book and its topic are fascinating cocktail party talk - but I don't think the book lives up to the hype.  I read this in one afternoon - it was engaging and enjoyable, but not great literature or (yes, a bad pun) the bible truth. I know it is fiction, but I thought the author took some liberties with the geography of Paris, as well as the actual history of the Priory and Templar Knights, which I found distracting. I enjoy reading books set in places I am familiar with and inaccurancies take away from that. It's just not that hard to get from the Louvre to the American Embassy. I'd recommend it, but with a few caveats.
B00005JM02|1.0|I must admit, I am a huge fan of Disney films, and the work of Disney and Pixar is always pleasing. But I am more a fan of cel animation, and computer animation can only last so long before you get tired of it.<br />Pixar films like Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. are the only two Pixar films I actually would rate high. Toy Story's sequal was really unneeded, and A Bugs Life just wasn't up to game. But when you ask me about Finding Nemo, I'd say this much....<br />Finding Nemo was made out in advertizments to be a very funny, and haert warming film. At veiwing I saw none of these qualities.<BR>Yes it's true you get a few laughs out of it, but thats all. It lacks a real point, and a journy across the sea would be much more exciting then some jelly fish, vegetarian sharks, and surfer dude turtles.  Ellen Degeneress, although a very good and funny actress, couldn't save this movie.<br />My expectaions must have been to high, but this proves that Pixar is slouching.  I didn't even feel bad when Marlin's wife Coral died. It was just a failed attempt to make the movie emotional. <br />If you want a movie, I suggest you buy The Lion King, or Lilo and Stitch. Both of which are actually worth your money. If it's Pixar you want, you can't go wrong with Monsters Inc. or Toy Story.<br />P.S. The animation was perfect, but thats not enough to help this film slide.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a great film.  While I'm sure that some of the poor reviews here missed the absent chase scenes, this is an adult movie about adult relationships.  Maybe a little too threatening for some.  Bill Murray is incredible at conveying solitude and loss of connection.

B00018D44U|4.0|In the recent Times interview, Norah Jones confessed that she hopes to tone down the hype of this album with the overwhelming success of &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; that garnered a whooping 18 million sales. Feels like Home, her sophomore effort shows that Jones is completely in a class of her own with more focused music direction and a stronger country flavor. With the simple production from Arif Mardin, Jones' album is quietly affecting especially in the first single &quot;Sunrise&quot; and love ballad &quot;Humble Me&quot; and the introspective &quot;Carnival Town&quot;. Her collaboration with bluegrass veteran Dolly Parton is a surprisingly chirpy and bouncy &quot;Creeping in&quot;. Her self-composed lyrics may lack the finesse but her rendition especially in &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; (which contains portion of Duke Ellington's Melancholia) is tenderly poignant and a revelation. Like what the title suggests, Norah Jones doesn't feel compelled to outshine. She feels just right at home - with understated grace and stunning vocal subtlety.
B00004TJTS|1.0|I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent &quot;uplifting&quot; family film, opt for &quot;The Sandlot.&quot;
0393316041|5.0|I was given this book by my CIO (one of those guys who proudly label themselves as a &quot;nerd&quot;) who told me to &quot;read this book, it's rad&quot;.  We're both voracious readers, so I knew this would be a great book, but I wasn't prepared for it to be such an &quot;important&quot; one.  But important it is.  This book details the life of a remarkably simple man driven by his passion for the truth, the sensory beauty of life, and the many mysteries of nature.<br />Ok, so getting a Nobel Prize and (for the most part) spawning the science of Modern Quantum clearly puts you in the category of &quot;interesting&quot;, what really stands R. Feyman out from the rest of his peers is the exceptional balance he managed to strike in his life between Productive (Science, Manhattan Project, etc.) and Sensory (Travel, Musical talent, wife/women).<br />Stories of him being the only scientist at Trinity (where the first atom bomb he worked on was detonated) to get out from the protected bunker so he could &quot;see&quot; the detonation (jumped behind the glass in his truck because he WAS PRETTY SURE the gamma and X-rays wouldn't harm his eyes) and him leading a protest against the shutting down of a local strip bar (where he would spend many of his final days doing drawings), this book details the life of one of the bravest, most accomplished, and dynamic men of our time.<br />A very worthwile read for those who are looking for a quick entertaining read, or for a hero.  I think you'll find them both in this book.<br />Hope this was helpful.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" was directed by Nancy Meyers, who gave us \\"What Women Want.\\" The common factor between the two films are that they are both about how men treat women. In this case, it is how an older man would treat a younger women, or vice versa. Or, that is how I thought of it as. Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton star, and Keaton has a performace that is Oscar worthy all the way. I felt that way even before the nominations came out, and I still feel that way. I saw the film twice already, and have decided to voice my mind over it now. <br />Jack Nicolson stars as Harry Sandborn, the owner of a successful hip hop label, and a person who dates women under 30. The only thing is, he is 63. His newest girlfriend is Marin, and the two go off to her mothers beach house for the weekend. It is supposed to be empty, so the two are surprised when Marin's mother Erika, and her sister Zoe show up. Erika is a playwright who wants to come for the peace and quiet so that she could write. She instantly doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with Harry. The four decide to stay at the house, untill Harry has a sudden heart attack. The doctor helping him, Julian Mercer, is a big fan of Erika's work. But when releasing Harry, he falls onto the ground, causing Julian to not let him travel for a couple of days. The only place for him to stay is the beach house, and that does not sit well with Erika. When Marin returns to work, Erika and Harry find themselves alone with each other, and complete opposites. But as they are alone, they relize that they have much more in common than they thought. And when Marin and Harry break up, romantic feelings begin to develop between Harry and Erika, but problems arise when it becomes clear that Julian wants to become involved with Erika, and Harry does not want to switch his lifestyle when it comes to women.<br />The only reason that I gave \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" four stars was because of the last few scenes. I don't want to ruin whathappens, but I don't feel that it should have ended the way it did. It started as a great, orignal, hilarious comedy, and then by the end just became another one of those predictable comedies that stick with a formula. That's why I liked the beginning. It wasn't formula. But the end was. Although it only got four stars, I do consider \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" one of the most notable films of last year, and it was a good enough movie to see in the theatres, and see more then once. I really did like it, and Keaton should get an Oscar. This movie is fun from start to finish.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated PG-13 sexual content, brief nudity and strong language.
0393317552|5.0|This is very important book about the powerful role that geography plays, and has played, in determining the relative success or failure of the societies it originates and gives shelter to.<br />I've had some fun in reading through the various and extremely varied reviews on the merit of J. Diamonds thesis.  Many \\"educated\\" minds have weighed in on the validity of \\"this or that\\" aspect of his basis.  Now, I'm not exactly at the forefront of modern biological, political, or social science, but I know enough to firmly believe that \\"geographic determinism\\" is a major influence on societal development.  When I look at it through the lens of Chaos Theory (where big outcomes are sensitively influenced products of tiny variables) it seems clear to me that where societies originated on this map could very well be the biggest factor in determining their success.<br />This is a fascinating read.  Very well researched, peppered with interesting historical stories and insight.  I'm sure there are holes in Jareds position, as is the case with even well developed science, but this is an important addition to anyones understanding about history, societies, and their frequent inequity.
B00013PHGS|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: Talkie Walkie is not a \\"return to form.\\" This CD is much, much better than Moon Safari. In Talkie Walkie, Godin and Dunckel have finally found the emotional core of their music. The electronics are less intrusive, and consequently the feel of the music is more organic (read: less artifical). You don't have anything like \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" on this album, which is a relief in my view. They've dropped the cynical lyrics of 10,000 Hz Legend, but taken away the main lesson of killer tracks like \\"Sex Born Poison,\\" which is that there is a real power in minimal, acoustic instrumentation.<br />Songs like \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" fairly boil over with emotion,  largely due to a beautiful acoustic guitar riff and astonishingly pretty vocals. It feels absolutely authentic, though. You just can't bring yourself to care that the lyrics are kind of insipid. \\"Mike Mills\\" is another great example of what happens when Air makes proper use of acoustic instrumentation. Gorgeous acoustic guitar, grand piano, and a phenomenal string arrangement take this song to places I never would have expected. It almost ends up sounding like a Mason Williams song. A whistling riff, supplemented by strings, makes \\"Alppha Beta Gaga\\" come together--had this been Moon Safari, the part probably would have been performed by a comparatively obnoxious synth lead.<br />Air has flirted with palpable vulnerability before, most notably in \\"How Does It Make You Feel?\\" but this time around they've really nailed it. \\"Alone in Kyoto,\\" possessed of a wonderfully minimalist arrangement, excels in this respect. The carefully balanced interaction of acoustic guitar, piano, bells, and shimmering vocal flourishes brings to mind a delicate crystal lattice. \\"Run\\" is also a strangely vulnerable song. Like \\"Alone in Kyoto,\\" this track benefits from an everything-in-its-right-place arrangement. <br />Some of the songs clearly draw precedent from previous albums. \\"Biological\\" is a reprise of \\"Sex Born Poison,\\" this time with a folk-inflected chorus. \\"Run\\" sounds a bit like Air remade \\"Remember\\" with help from Enya.<br />For some reason, a lot of people are comparing \\"Surfing On a Rocket\\" to \\"Sexy Boy.\\" There's really no connection other than the fact that both are upbeat and catchy. In my opinion, \\"Surfing On a Rocket\\" surpasses \\"Sexy Boy,\\" largely because of its expeditious use of guitar and catchy chord changes. While this song is heavy on electronic bass and drums, Air chose wisely in avoiding distracting \\"wah wah\\" synth loops this time around.<br />The bottom line is that with this album, Air's sound has noticeably matured. They've hit their stride, and by God, I like it!
0385720920|5.0|I've read hundreds of books and \\"Choke\\" is tied with \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" (by Hunter S. Thompson) as the funniest I've ever read...I'm talking laugh-out-loud funny.  I read this by the pool at my club a couple of years ago and no doubt came off as something close to a lunatic...but it was worth it.<br />So, just for the laughs this book earns its keep; but more than that, Palahniuk offers a very unique and insightful view into human nature, human relationships, and the perverse notions that drive so many seemingly benign and \\"normal\\" things people do everyday.<br />If you liked Fight Club the movie, you'll love this book. It's modern, hilarious, easy-to-read writing wrapped around a complex and deeply interesting plot about an extremely \\"sick\\" young man, who in his dealings with the \\"normal world\\" throughout the book seems less and less sick by contrast.<br />Very worth the read.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones had no hope of pleasing everyone with this album.  Any follow-on album is inevitably compared to the first (read the reviews containing the word &quot;sophomore&quot;).  To many listeners, this album fails where the first, however unintentionally, succeeded: single-ready songs with a thick sultry polish.<br />But in many respects, this is the collection she was born to create.  The country influence in very apparent and, frankly, refreshing.  The songs obviously are crafted with care and executed very well.  Dolly Parton makes an appearance that contributes to the overall feeling of the album rather than destracting the listener (as is so often the risk).  You may detect an accordian, but you're not beaten over the head with it.  And Norah continues to be a team player, welcoming artistic input from those worthy of providing it, without letting the songs seem anything but personal.<br />This album earns a solid 4 stars, leaving room for even more excellence from Norah in the future.
B00005N9CV|3.0|An anxiously awaited release following her hugely successful Grammys winning album WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES, this fully titled and themed romantic collection (albeit boasted with the support of a rich London orchestra team) lacks the former's vibrant variations of tunes and it appears more like a complimentary package for both industry and the fans thereafter.<br />Though 'S WONDERFUL will remain the most sultry fore track after all listenings, with CRY ME A RIVER and I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL both serve up well deep emotional vocal approach, which is something unique of the sonorous Canadian jazz pianist/songstress.<br />However songs like BESAME MUCHO and the title track THE LOOK OF LOVE are apparently letting down, completely not creative but rather sort of a clich&eacute; sampling in popular jazz business. Worst, the latter made me skip past the torturing MAYBE YOU'LL BE THERE at the end in most of my listenings. In delight the lusciously moody DANCING IN THE DARK does earn some credits, the extended beats arrangement would actually replay in my remote mind afterwards.<br />I'm quickly looking forward to better years in Diana Krall.
B00018D44U|5.0|There's no sophomore slump for Norah.  This CD is just as good, if not better, than her debut. Norah is going to go down as one of her generation's bestsongwriters, and listening to this CD will prove why. The songs are generally moe upbeat than her debut, but ifyou liked it, you'll have to have her second offering.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Australia's coolest blonde for Hollywood Cate Blanchett should have won the Best Actress of 1998 Academy Awards over Gwyneth Paltrow in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, no matter that she already won in the Golden Globe. Her pale white beauty with the ruthless stare is incomparably real for the role Queen Elizabeth I. Her acting and perfect English accent and speeches strove to be among the A-lists i.e. Meryl Streep etc.<br />From the beginning when Elizabeth is wrongly accused to be sentenced, the times during her political standing against all rivalries and their hidden agendas, to the end she rises to her feet as the ultimate Virgin Queen, Blanchett is fully in control of her powerful acting and plays her parts stately. And when it comes to her affair with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), Blanchett's soft feminine side shines through radiantly.<br />This DVD will always remain one of my favourite period films for a very long time.

B00009L1TA|2.0|Once again, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are the central characters in another military action movie. The plot is as follows: a hard-time sargeant, played by Jackson, comes up with a live-fire drill in the forests of Panama, but the exercise goes terribly wrong; everyone but two of the army soldiers end dead, and the two remaining won't agree on what really happened during the drill. Hardy, played by Travolta, is the ex-army interrogator summoned by the commander of the barracks to solve the mistery.<br />OK, the premise is good. The film is told in flashbacks, the same scene repeated many times, different according to each and new version of the story, as they come to light. The acting is quite good, especially by Jackson (no surprise here). Direction is also OK, by John McTiernan (Die Hard). And the movie is quite enjoyable, at least until the final twenty minutes, when a series of endless and completely absurd, unbelievable plot twists (full of plot holes) ruin the entire film. If you want to have an idea of the absurdity of the plot, just access the IMDB page for \\"Basic\\" and its message board section.<br />Watching the credits, I realised the screenwriter, a certain fellow named James Vanderbilt, made his debut with \\"Darkness Falls\\", which I consider to be one of the Bottom-Five movies I've ever watched. \\"Darkness Falls\\" is ridiculous. The screenplay of \\"Basic\\" is almost as ridiculous. I really, really don't understand why a cast composed of such good and acclaimed actors say \\"yes\\" to such a poor writing.<br />After the movie ended, I was angry, I felt cheated and I promised to myself I will NEVER watch another movie that has a screenplay by Vanderbilt. I don't like to be treated like an idiot, and that's what this script did to me.<br />Grade 4.0/10

0385504209|3.0|Review by Richard Gray<br />[...]<br />Robert Langdon, a famous Harvard Symbologist, gets woken by the police late one night while in Paris to give a lecture. He finds that the elderly curator of Louvre has been murdered, his body stripped naked, laid spread eagle, with a pentacle carved into his body and a coded message written beside him. Robert also finds that he is the primary suspect for the murder, and that the French police chief, Fache, may need to convict Langdon to save his own job.<br /><br />Helped by police code-breaker, and the granddaughter of the Louvre curator, Sophie Neveu, Langdon flees the crime scene in hope of either making it to the US embassy to avoid being convicted of a murder he didn't commit, or solve the strange code left by the body in hopes of proving his innocence.<br /><br />At the risk of spoiling anything (though if you've read any of the controversy around this book this part is probably already spoiled) Langdon finds that in order to prove his innocence he must find The Holy Grail which is protected by a secrete society called The Priory of Sion. The 'Holy Grail' isn't actually a cup that held Christ's blood, it is actually the bones of Mary Magdalene, the woman who Jesus is supposed to have married, and documents that show Jesus and Mary had children and that Jesus was not divine, simply a great prophet.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from the last paragraph, this book has ruffled the feathers of many Christians out there, particularly Catholics. Langdon puts forth an alternative version of history that is more or less well researched and will probably seem more appealing to those who are not  upset by the idea of Jesus having a wife, or that Jesus is not necessarily divine.<br /><br />However, this is not to say that all of the claims that Brown makes, or seems to support in this book, are on steady ground. Much of this book is built around proving that Da Vinci believed this version of history by examining his artwork. Some of these 'symbologist' proofs are very interesting, and others are stretching it. There is also the looming, annoying flaw in his logic that just because Da Vinci believed a certain version of history, does not make that version of history correct, regardless of wether or not he was the head of the Priory of Sion.<br /><br />All of the controversy aside, this is an enjoyable read, though I don't think that, as a novel, it deserves all of the attention that it's getting. Brown is a very skilled writer as far as crafting his sentences and paragraphs, but the plot is a bit formulaic and even verges on unintentional silliness. The ultra short chapters, the constant running and narrow escapes, and how the main characters literally take turns solving the little puzzles makes things a bit tiresome.  The plot structure reminded me of the Doctor Who episodes I used to watch as a kid, only instead of time lords, Cyber men and Darleks, you have art symbologists, Opus Dei, and the Priory of Sion.<br /><br />The book is best read just one short chapter a day (some chapters are short enough to be put on a daily calendar) and if you try to read much more than that the repetitive plot structure might start to get on your nerves. There were points in the story where, if I read too much of it at once,  I'd say to myself, \\"For non-divine Christ sakes, not another puzzle. Just find the blasted thing!\\"<br /><br />People who thoroughly enjoy riddles, cross word puzzles, and constant narrow escapes will probably give this book 4 or 5 out of five stars. If you don't fall into that category then this is a solid 3 stars. Also people who don't read very often, or who prefer short, sweet chapters will probably find this book a safe bet. It's a good book, but it just doesn't live up to all of the hype. If the alternative version of history is what draws you to it, then you might be better served by picking up a copy of \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" which seems to be one of Brown's predominant historical sources.<br /><br />Richard Gray<br /><br />[...]edominant historical sources.  <BR><BR><br />Richard Gray<BR><BR>[...]<BR>
0385510438|5.0|The Last Juror begins with humor and ends with pathos. In between, its author paints a detailed panorama of the life of a small Mississippi town called Clanton in the 1970's, when Brown v. Board of Education had not been implemented, few blacks succeeded in registering to vote, and the legal system was corrupt. We watch the town's center of gravity shift from downtown to the suburbs as genuine interracial friendships are formed in an era of token toleration. The plot is painstakingly and plausibly constructed; the characters from both races are fully developed; the ethnic and religious stereotypes that characterize some of Grisham's earlier novels are refreshingly absent; and the writing is flawless. The most sympathetically portrayed woman is a dignified, well-spoken black matron, whose large, successful family is daringly portrayed in a two-part article appearing on the front page of  the local newspaper, which is owned by the protagonist.  The most respected merchant, owner of  a clothing store, is a Hungarian immigrant. The importance of religion to both races is emphasized in a detailed description of scores of local churches, their congregations, and their ministers. Grisham seems to have mellowed and matured to the point that speculation about his rumored interest in entering politics appears warranted.
B00005T7I1|4.0|I remember being intrigued by this movie when it first came out (when I was young and had not seen it yet).  So I bought the DVD, saw it a few times and my verdict is in.  I'm impressed with the effort put into it, such as the cartoon-like cinematography, art direction, legendary music by Sondheim, and all those cool cameos in the film (check the cast listing).  Al Pacino did a good job as Big Boy Caprice and his Oscar nomination for supporting actor is well deserved.  Although Beatty's performance as Dick Tracy is a bit dry, I believe the part called for it, the same goes for most of the characters.  There is not much character development here with only one exception.  This exception being the Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who starts out as a homeless-orphan-street-thief, but ends up being taken under Tracy's wing and becoming Tracy's sidekick.  Korsmo acting seemed authentic, and some of the most emotional scenes in the movie are between him and Tracy.  Such as when the Kid receives an honorary badge for saving Tracy's life, and when he chooses Dick Tracy Jr. for a name.  Madonna looks really beautiful (perhaps the best she has ever looked on film) and does a decent job as Breathless, but her best parts are when she sings or her one-liners (but again I think the part called for it).  Also I was pleasantly surprised that Madonna actually has two roles in the film (you would have to see to find out).  Overall, though I was intrigued by the movie as a youngster, I must say that despite the considerable effort put into the film, I feel that it lacks charm and intrigue. But again for the third time think the comic strip origins of the movie called for it, and because of this it may leave viewers without any afterthoughts, and what adds to this is the fact that there is no special features at all on the DVD!
0316174483|5.0|A friend of mine gave me a copy of Ed Emberley's \\"Fingerprint Drawing Book\\" and some colored stamp pads for my birthday last year. I had so much fun with it, that I bought the \\"Complete Funprint Drawing Book\\" for my five year old niece. We both have lots of fun making \\"thumbies\\", and she's able to follow the steps very easily.<br />I enjoy decorating blank cards and envelopes, and have created scenes using combinations of various fingerprint figures. For example, on one card, I created a winter scene using the skiier, ice skater and snowman, and another using the football player and cheerleader figures. I also use a variation of the queen \\"thumbie\\" on the membership cards I've created for my local chapter of Sweet Potato Queens, known as The Couch Potato Queens.<br />Fingerprint art is fun for everyone, and the books are great!
B00005JLK1|4.0|When I first saw this one out, I wasn't sure I was going to watch it. It seemed like one of those that had been done before, if you know what I mean. Imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find it a really great adventure! There are some nice twists in this movie that I actually didn't see coming. Great acting, too!
B00005JME0|4.0|Ever since I first saw previews for this film, I was excited about it. Anytime the subject of time travel is approached, it usually makes for an interesting and exciting film. However, the film did have the critics going against it, and Ashton Kutcher trying to play in a dramatic role. <br />I finally got to see the movie recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film turned out to be. While it is not the best time travel film I have ever seen, it was extremely entertaining and suspenseful to see all the different lifetimes being played out. I really enjoyed the fact that Kutcher's character used his mind to travel in time and not a machine. The movie can be frustrating at times. In fact, after the first 20 minutes of the film I had serious doubts. Things would happen, followed by Ashton's Kutcher's character having a blackout right at the moment when an explanation was needed. This left myself and the rest of the audience feeling confused at what was playing out. But after the film gets over the initial speed bump in the beginning, The Butterfly Effect turns into a riveting thriller and everything is explained in the long run. The entire cast did a fantastic job in my opinion. While I still feel that Ashton Kutcher is not a very good actor, he did a lot better than I thought he would. Especially, when you consider the fact that he is known for being a comedy actor.<br />One of the best things about this film was the ending. It was not your typical happy ending. While every character's life turned out for the better, Kutcher's character still experiences loss and regret by how the story turns out. I was very happy with the ending, because it actually manages to leave your emotions feeling conflicted, which gets you thinking about how things could have been. Anytime you leave the theater in discussion about what you would have done differently, it means that the film made an impression on you. That is definately something that The Butterfly Effect manages to do.<br />I really don't understand the harsh treatment from critics. In Entertainment Weekly, the average grade for this film is a \\"C-\\". While The Butterfly Effect does have its flaws, it turned out to be a riveting thriller, with an original take on timetravel and an unpredictable ending.<br />A solid 4 out of 5 stars.
B00018D44U|3.0|I loved &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;; the songs were catchy, had identifiable and strong tunes, and were just the right lengths.  This new CD, though not bad, certainly does not live up to Norah Jones' debut.  &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is a relaxing and nice album, just like her first, but there is not one song that I like as much as Don't Know Why, Seven Years, Feelin' the Same Way, or virtually every track on &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot;  Sunrise, Carnival Town, and The Long Way Home were all OK (Sunrise especially,) but none of them hit me as particularly good, and I actually found myself fastfowarding through most of the songs halfway through - not a good thing.  <BR>       <BR>Creepin' In, with Dolly Parton, along with too many of the tracks, sounds far too much like country music. I am not a big fan of country, and - even if you are -  the whole CD seems to have lost much of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;'s lovely jazzy quality.<BR> <BR>However, not all is lost.  Ms. Jones' singing is, as always, incredible, and there are a few nice tunes, namely Humble Me, Sunrise, Don't Miss You at All, and Carnival Town.  Nonetheless, there are no hits on this CD; almost all tracks on the last CD were possible hits.  <br />The Bottom Line:<BR>This CD is OK, but, if you don't like country music or even if you do, try and listen to it before buying it.
0440213525|4.0|John Grisham is famous for his ability for making a story so live and real. It makes you draw into the story even more. Reading this story was almost like seeing a movie! An 11-year old boy named Mark Sway out smarts the mafia and tries to save his life as well as his family. Mark was stirred into this mess after he was smoking a cigarette in the Forrest with his younger brother. While he was smoking, he saw a car pull over and a very angry and sad man come out. The man wanted to kill himself because he was one of the mafia's lawyers and knows too much about a senator's death. Before killing himself he told Mark Sway where the senator's body was hidden. Mark's knowledge about where the body is buried alarmed the mafia. Now the mafia isn't going after the lawyer, they are going after Mark Sway and his family.<BR> If you read the story for the first time, you will get into this atomicity. There won't be a word John Grisham say's that you won't believe. After closing the book when you start thinking about how brave Mark was, you start to realize that it isn't so easy to get away from an angry mob. The interesting part about this is that John Grisham, in the story makes it sound so real that you won't even care about it. He covers it up cleaner than how the F.B.I cover up a death crime.<BR> This book isn't the longest book ever, but it's pretty long. If you enjoy this book at the start it would take you about 1-3 days to finish it. I remembered when I read it, it only took a few hours because I enjoyed it a lot.
0060934913|5.0|Where does one begin to comment on this wonderful, many faceted book? Do you comment on Bourdain's early years working in New England fish restaurants whose number one competitor was Mario's Restaurant that turned out six hundred meals on an average night or do you jump forward to the book's last days when he is told by the owners to oversee the establishment of a new restaurant in Tokyo? This book is truly a culinary journey and more interestingly I believe a &quot;Coming of Age&quot; in an industry that can vacillate between the life on a road crew in the Arizona desert or the intensity and concentration of a symphony orchestra-the sublime to the ridiculous.<br />Besides the extraordinary insights into restaurants,<br />food preparation and management from the other side of the kitchen trenches, Bourdain gives his readers a funny and trenchant look at the marvelous personalities that have peppered his career. Who could ever forget Bigfoot-the ownership steward par excellence or Steven-Bourdain's right hand sous chef or New York's best baker-Adam-Real Last Name Unknown. The section about Adam alone is worth the cost of the book-even if, and that would be a severe mistake, you read nothing else of this wonderful work.<br />Read this book because it's funny, wise and allows a peek into a foreign world but a world whose edges are familiar to anyone who eats.

And didn't Gollum just steal the show in this one! (Andy, you are a marvel! I'm so glad we got to see you in the third one!)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You don't have to be a buffy lover to enjoy this show.  This is one of the best scifi shows ever.  The cast dynamic was equivelant to a show many years into production.  If you enjoy shows like star trek, stargate sg1, farscape, etc. you will like this show.  There is no over the top, cheesy fight scenes or flamboyant special effects.  Everything was done top notch.  I am amazed that this came from the same person as buffy the vampire slayer because it has no similarities to it.  Don't pass this one up.  You will not be disappointed.
0688170528|4.0|'The Pact' may look like paperback's answer to the ever-popular cheesy chick flick. Regardless of the rather insipid storyline, this book was actually rather disturbing, bringing up the frightening question of how well we can ever really know another person.<br />The Golds and the Hartes are next-door neighbors and inseparable friends, so as soon as their children's friendship grows into something more, both sets of parents are ecstatic. However cliché the plot may sound, an interesting twist is delivered right up front; Emily Gold is dead at seventeen, and the local detectives doubt Chris Harte's story of a suicide pact.<br />The mushiness of Chris and Emily's picture perfect romance is kept to a minimum with most of the book concentrating on how Chris and both sets of parents deal with Emily's death. The couple's relationship is limited to a series of flashbacks, starting from childhood and progressing to Emily's death. Jodi Picoult manages to keep you guessing at what really happened on the night of Emily's `suicide' right until the very end when all the characters finally realize just how little they actually knew one another.
0066214122|3.0|Using facts of computer programming and multitudes of biological research, Crichton has collaborated another page-turner on the futuristic insights of human progress.  With all of the supporting evidence, one might say that this scenario could actually occur.  Already, scientists are cloning and there's nothing stopping them from making anything biologically dangerous out of genetic manipulation.  <BR>The idea of the book is that technology can be too much for us to handle.  Though geniuses we are, we still make stupid mistakes.  In this case: man lives, man creates, and man gets into trouble - or really just one man gets to clean up the mess.<br />This one man turns out to be the typical three-kids-day-care dad who knows how to program codes.  He struggles with his personal life while trying to find a new job.  <br />Everyday, he encounters the same thing, kids in the bratty prattling stage, endless name calling and torment between sibling rivalries.  The children are portrayed so amusingly that they don't even seem to be real.  In fact, they are the \\"hell\\" that parents live though.          <br />Finally, we get to the big kick: the main-character's wife and his pal, Jimmy, are the closest people imaginable to him.  He knows them like the back of his hand, but they are the ones who start the trouble.<br />Questioning the rights of creation, this scenario is very unique, but like most playing God scenarios that Crichton has written, this also turns out like an action movie ready to be filmed, like the old-timer's Jurassic Park.  Unlike most prescript-novels, Prey is a considerably complicated fact book in which the reader needs to truly understand and follow the fundamentals of bio-engineering.  The narration style is the key to the revelation of the plot.  And like I said: Man lives, man creates, man gets into trouble, and man might come out alive.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is a classic example of the Press saying this is a Great film and the lemmings follow. If you enjoy watching two pathetic characters like voyeurs, this talky two hours is your cup of tea. Don't give me that character study crapola. I have viewed hyped movies before and been disapointed but this is like being told that dinner will be steak and baked spud and getting last weeks wilted lettuce.Don't waste your time or the money spent. If Sophia or Bill gets the Oscar, it is fixed!
B00003CXXM|4.0|I thought Matt Damon's role in The Bourne Identity was every bit as good at Richard Chamberlin's in the original version, and maybe even better. The updating made the movie look great, and Matt has great expressions that can convey meaning without words. I like Richard Chamberlin, but I'm not sure he'd be able to do that. Great entertainment here and well worth adding to your collection!
0553801546|4.0|Robin Hobb writes very quickly.  Some places in this final volume of the second trilogy show that she could use a bit of editting.  However, the story carries you past the rough parts with ease.  The relationships that we have come to care so much about from earlier volumes are all given solid conclusions.  Hobb lingers just the right amount of time with each.  Although some feel a bit contrived, it is easy to forgive her for she and we are saying goodbye to friends that we have cared about for 3000 pages.  <br />At times the story is exciting and mysterious.  At times the story is introspective and romantic.  While on the surface this book is about a Prince's quest to slay a dragon, the book is really about making new beginnings from scarred endings.  Hobb does a masterful job of carrying the symbolism of scars and scarring throughout the book.  There are some surprises here and some people we have not seen since the first trilogy return.  <br />Highly recommend this volume if you like the series and recommend the series if you like fantasy with some thought in it.

0385510438|3.0|In his last two books &quot;Bleachers&quot; and &quot;The king of Torts&quot;, Grisham explored other genres of writing. The former evolves around reminiscences of a high school football team and the latter has to do with big shot lawyers (this is closer to a legal thriller, but not quite there). Neither of these novels was very good, and it seems that the author understood that he should go back to what he does best, writing legal thrillers. &quot;The Last juror&quot; would have been great if he had stuck to this approach. After a very interesting and fast-paced Part One, in which he describes the trial vividly grabbing the reader's attention without letting go, the quality of the novel declines abruptly in Part Two and only recovers somewhat in the last part.<br />The storyteller, Willie Frayner, is a journalist that starts an internship at The Ford County Times after his studies are cut short by his grandmother's decision of stopping the flow of money she was providing. The paper soon gets into financial trouble, goes bankrupt, and Willie convinces his grandma to give him $50,000 to buy it. At about this time Danny Padgitt rapes and kills Rhoda Kassellaw, mother of two little children, and there are enough witnesses and evidence to build a clear-cut case. Nevertheless, the killer belongs to one of the most powerful families in the area; family feared by many because of the way they had disposed of their &quot;problems&quot; in the past. The Times, under Willie's lead, sets out in an uncompromising and daring coverage of the trial and every aspect of the case that shows the &quot;special treatment&quot; the accused receives. This creates a dangerous situation for Willie, who is clearly playing with fire.<br />As it usually happens in Grisham books, the story presents the reader with a shocking view of the social and racial inequalities that existed in Mississippi in 1970, which from my point of view gives a significant added value to the book. In this environment, Willie establishes a very special relationship with a black woman that has an extraordinary family; seven out of eight siblings are college professors in a time in which inequalities are abundant. Even the eighth one is on its way to achieve similar feats, but he has found some added difficulties in his past. Of course, the events regarding this family will be intertwined with the main story.<br />As a final comment, I would recommend you not to read the description provided in the dust jacket, which in my opinion contains a huge plot spoiler. It would be better to find out what happens in the trial and afterwards by yourself., Willie establishes a very special relationship with a black woman that has an extraordinary family; seven out of eight siblings are college professors in a time in which inequalities are abundant.

0446530891|2.0|I was looking for a &quot;page turner&quot; from an author who had been a best seller.  It was very good until I was about 75% through it.  Then, he began to mix so many characters and plots that it became confusing.  I couldn't keep everything straight from the time I put it down for a couple of days until I finally finished.  A real disappontment!
B000127LW2|5.0|I grew up with Star Trek. In the 70's and 80's, when I was a kid, the reruns of all the old Star Trek episodes were playing. When TNG came out, I felt betrayed because, well, it wasn't Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones and all the other charachters that I grew up watching. Of course after watching TNG I, like most of the fans, saw the brillance in it and continued watching.<br />Well, when DS9 came out I saw it a few times and well, just stopped watching. When Voyager came out I wasn't even interested in seeing it.<br />All this was until 2002. Unfortunately I didn't start catching the show until the last few seasons. Then I saw all the reruns at lease twice; I never missed an episode. After watching the whole series, I would have to say that this is the best Star Trek series. Every charachter is great, the stories are great, and the journey is awesome. This is more like what Star Trek was originally since it's not so scripted; meaning, the crew never knows what's going to happen. <br />In TNG, they were always getting calls and had to go to the Nuetral Zone to save some cat on a tree or whatever, but in Voyager, they are in the Delta quandrant and don't have Starfleet to rely on. <br />This has become my favorite Star Trek series, even beating TNG and the original series. Tuvok by far is the best Vulcan of any Star Trek series (even Spock!), 7 of 9 is awesome (physically too, of course, but I mean her charachter). Belana, Tom Paris, Janeway, the whole crew is just awesome. Even Hector from Night of the Comet has a great role in this! Seriously though, this is an awesome series and a must for any Star Trek fan.<br />After looking over this I realized I am a dork. I never thought about it before, but now I know. I'm a Star Trek freak but never really realized it. Wow... I wonder if it was all that Romulan Ale?
0385504209|4.0|I review this book with caution as it appears readers seem to either love or hate the book. Personally, I found the book fascinating. It has me looking up the true origin of any old term of phrase or symbol that I come across nowadays. It makes me think more deeply about all those symbols which we use so matter of factly that they are no longer truly symbolic. Sure, everyone has a sense of what the Nike swoosh stands for, but what about Leonardo Da Vinci's &quot;Last Supper&quot;? Nobody really studies those things any more, and they have become a  lost history among our society.<br />It is with skill, then, that Dan Brown manages to interest his readers into a topic that is almost a millenium old.  He appears to have done a bunch of research for this book. Not only that, but he also put a lot of effort into making that research come to life without seeming overwhelmingly heavy or detailed in the prose. That's not an easy thing to do, and it's what I most admire about the book. You only need to pick up a bunch of academic papers to realise that &quot;english&quot; is not a first language when it comes to scientific debate. We rely on journalists, movie directors and authors like Dan Brown to make such laden themes with their secretive and prohibitive language digestible for the general public's enjoyment.<br />Rather than taking the easy route by writing a simple, straight lined story about some art historian's discovery of the symbology of the Holy Grail, Brown created a mixture of interesting characters that each play a definitive role in his murder mystery. It's a combination of an Agatha Christie novel and a fictional history book. The skill of combining those diverse elements cannot have been easy, yet Brown manages to bring it off with a simplistic flair.<br />In truth, his story is captivating. It starts off with a bang - a murder of a curator. The audience is carried along with the main characters, and for a good part of the book we are shrouded by the truth. If you love solving puzzles, you will be able to &quot;beat&quot; the character to identifying the next clue or uncovering critical bits of information  by looking closely at the text (mirrors recommended).<br />Of course, no one is expecting a work of fiction to be entirely based on truth, but Brown has a different treatment of the age old topic of the Holy Grail and his take on it I found to be interesting.<br />Moreover, it has all the things a good book should have: it's engaging, easy to read in bite size chunks that should appeal to the general public, it's full of action and mystery, and it's well researched, thus has a ring of truth to it. I feel I must &quot;defend&quot; this book because I enjoyed every minute of reading it even though that opinion is probably not in vogue with &quot;serious&quot; readers..

B000001FTH|4.0|My first introduction to Grace Jones is when I saw the music video for &quot;Love Is The Drug&quot; on VH1 Classic and i knew i was going to be hooked for life. I managed to go to my local used cd store and i found this &quot;Island Life&quot; cd. I picked it up, brought it home, and popped it in my cd player. The first 3 songs are from her first 3 disco albums Portfolio, Fame, and Muse. The last two are long out of print. My favorite song out of those 3 is I Need A Man. But then we get onto the better early 80's material such as Love Is The Drug, Pull Up To The Bumper, and My Jamaican Guy. The cd ends with Slave To The Rhythm which is a pretty cool song. My only complaint about this cd is that I wish they included more songs such as Demolition Man and She's Lost Control but i'm still pretty satisfied. I hope she makes a comeback in 2004.
B0000A118M|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I don't even know what else to say... It's above and beyond that which you'd normally expect of music. It's deep... it's emotional... (i don't know so much about its being spiritual. i didn't get that at all.) It's gorgeous. But it's certainly not for people who dislike experimentation and prefer everything to resolve neatly and happily. (Remembering the look of horror on my mother's face...) If you are like my mother, you will not like this. It is more feeling than music. If you can dig it, buy this album for the feeling.
B00018D44U|3.0|There is something wrong with this disc.  I get all kinds of weird error codes on my cd player when inserting this disc.  It will play on my dvd player and pc but not my cd player.  Amazon says it's enhanced and that's one of the error codes I get, &quot;E disc&quot;.  Music is fair to middlin as they say.  Sunrise is great opening tune and probably worth the price of admission.  Don't care for the country tunes and Dolly but what the heh.  This disc is going back and maybe wait for the cd.  Also, it sounds distorted.  This has been reported on Blue Notes web site.  Evidently some of these are deflective.
B00005QK39|5.0|This could be the best album of the 80's. However, it happens that \\"The Final Cut\\" by Pink Floyd was released in the same year - 1983 - a magical year because of this two albums.<br />Anyway, this is one of the best debut albums I have ever heard, comparable to Tindersticks' first album, dEUS' \\"Worst Case Scenario\\" or Puressence's debut.<br />When this album was released, Marillion had a relative success in the UK, due to the single \\"Market Square Heroes\\" (which can be briefly spotted during the radio station tuning in the introduction of the last track - \\"Forgotten Sons\\").<br />The magic starts with the cover - a marvellous painting of a jester's trying to play \\"Yesterday\\" (The Beatles) in a violin. Like most progressive rock bands, the cover served as an introduction to the band's own world and took advantage of the vynil format (the back cover and the front cover form a single image).<br />The start is tremendous. For me, \\"Script For A Jester's Tear\\" is still Marillion's best song. The begginning of the song recalls \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" from the Genesis album \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" with the first phrase sung without music (the music starts immediately after the first phrase). The song is divided into four parts. The first is mysterious and mellodramatic and ends with \\"...the game is over\\". The second section is very rythmical and the lyrical content is just the repetition of phrases sung in the first part. The third part starts with \\"I act the role in a classic style\\" and returns a soft and mysterious mood. The beautiful and unforgettable fourth part is very grandiloquent and starts with \\"the fool escaped from paradise...\\". The end is \\"can you still say you love me?\\" sung several times, recalling, in a certain way, the ending of another Genesis song: \\"The Musical Box\\" (from the album \\"Nursery Cryme\\") when Gabriel sings/begs \\"why don't you touch me?\\" lots of times.<br />\\"He Knows, You Knows\\" is also a great song. It was the first single of this album and is a shorter and balanced track, more suitable for radio listeners (if all the songs on the radio sounded so good...).<br />\\"The Web\\" is the longest theme and it is also fascinant with lots of different parts and great keyboards by Mark Kelly.<br />\\"Garden Party\\" was the second single. This is Marillion, particulary Fish, showing their sense of humour. It's a joyful melody, very different from most Marillion songs.<br />\\"Chelsea Monday\\" is the album's second best song. The bass (played by Peter Trewavas) is remarkable. It's a slow and subtle song.<br />\\"Forgotten Sons\\" is my least favourite although highly considered by the fans. Nevertheless, it has the Marillion's unique sound.<br />If you like the \\"Peter Gabiel Genesis era\\" you will surely love this album. Yet, Marillion have their personality and are something more than a Genesis copy. Trust me: hear it several times and feel addicted.
B000056K04|1.0|What more can be said?  it lacks intelligent, fresh themes and complex lyrics and is ultimately boring.  The only song worth listening to is \\"What You Are,\\" as it has a hard-edged vibe similar to old-school (non-BTCS) versions of \\"Halloween.\\"  Also, the song \\"Everyday,\\" a revised version of its earlier superior, \\"#36,\\" is good when Matthews softly sings it alone on the acoustic (as he did at the performance for the televised 9/11 fundraiser).  And interestingly, Everyday and their successive album, Busted Stuff, (both representing their worst efforts in the studio to date) are the only albums so far to feature the band members themselves as cover art.  draw your own conclusions.
B000066NW0|1.0|I'll make this review short and simple. This cd contains some the worst music ever. I'd rather listen to John Travolta or &quot;Disco Duck&quot; than this. &quot;Complicated&quot; is one of those songs you would hear over and over again in the burning pits of hell. &quot;Sk8tr Boi&quot; is bad enough to make your ears bleed. All the other songs suck too! Avoid at all costs.
0553582453|4.0|This second book, like so many others, suffers from the Middle Book Syndrome.  The main (only?) focus of this book is character developement.  There is hardly any action, and it was a little hard for me at first to be able to put my finger on a climax.  In fact, I think there is less action in this book than any of her other books so far.<br />Why, then, could I not put it down?<br />Well, in a manner of speaking, I think that Robin Hobb can write the most interesting boring story of any of the authors out there.  While there wasn't much action, there were plenty of plot developements to keep me interested.  Lots of things going on at the court and in Fitz's life, and it was hard to keep up with all them.  Something important did happen in almost every chapter, so the novel did seem fast-paced.  In fact, I don't think I've ever been so entranced in a novel that had apparently no action.  The characterization no doubt played a part there as well, and this time it's not so limited to Fitz.  And, Mrs. Hobb also brought unfinished plot threads from her Liveship series into this book.  I'm starting to see the picture: the Tawny Man is going to be a conclusion to both her previous series.  So, this novel was, all in all, a gripping read.<br />However, I still couldn't give more than four stars.  The best books are the ones that combine fast-paced action with complex plots and great characterizations.  (Assassin's Quest was one of those.)  Those books are rare, and that's five stars in my book.  I think many reviewers don't realize what five stars means.  Anyway, Golden Fool could've been better if there was action.  It's a middle book.  While it was entertaining of its own accord, it still served mainly as an introduction to the last volume.  Mrs. Hobb has certainly introduced a lot; it makes me wonder if she will wrap it all up.  But then, I felt the same way while reading Assassin's Quest, and I was pleasantly surprised when she did it , without rushing.  I get the feeling that Fool's Fate is going to be one hell of a book.  Now I just have to wait for it to come out in paperback.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Oh, the joy of being a movie geek. This year has been a tremendous blessing for all of the human race, or just us film fanatics, as the movie gods have listened to all our prayers to deliver cinematic goodness.  One of these that came as a major grace is called \\"Kill Bill: Volume One\\", the latest offering from the dark, perverted but brilliant mind of Quentin Tarantino. Last seen under the spotlight in 1997 with \\"Jackie Brown\\", we have been painfully awaiting his next move throughout a six-year-span. Well, time finally came upon us and the wait is definitely worth it. <br />Appropriately entitled \\"Kill Bill\\", Tarantino tells a simple revenge story, albeit through his usual non-linear storytelling structure, about a lanky blonde woman (played by the invigorating Uma Thurman) only known as \\"The Bride\\" a.k.a. \\"Black Mamba\\" who wakes up from a coma to exact revenge on her former assassin group called \\"The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad\\" lead by Bill (David Carradine), who aren't really happy of her decision to quit and marry someone in El Paso, Texas. Hence, bloody carnage ensues as Bill and the gang made of eclectic members-Budd, Vernita Green, Elle Driver and Oren-Ishii-massacres The Bride's family and guests on her wedding day, including her unborn baby. Bill saves her for last and shoots her head (on what could be one of the most startling introductions in a movie). Thinking that she's dead, they leave her cold in her blood-splattered wedding dress, which is a terrible mistake on their part, as The Bride gets up from her hospital bed after four years with furious determination and will to destroy every single one of the perpetrators, saving the best for last, which is, of course, Bill, proving that as far as justice goes, it can easily get very poetic. <br />However, this is only half of the story, as Miramix, the film distributor, and Tarantino himself decided to cut the three-hour long movie in half and released them four months apart. That being said, I am verysure that Volume Two will be as equally brutal and vigorously entertaining to what I've seen four times in the theaters (Yes, four times! It's that good!)<br />\\"Kill Bill: Volume One\\" is perhaps the most violent American movie ever (and I've seen a lot of movies). It can be easily be used as an example of how the morals of the Western world have dramatically fallen in the 21st century. But it's most important to know that this movie was made as an ode to those rare, odd, cheesy and absurd kung-fu, Western, exploitation, slasher and grindhouse movies we usually see gathering dust in the cult section of a video store or occasionally seen playing on television at 3 in the morning. Kill Bill: Volume One on the surface looks like a very empty fluff made to only shock the already seemingly desensitized viewers, but underneath, it is really a very intelligent piece of art. Intelligent in a sense that it knows the rules of the cinema: it knows it audiences are and doesn't give a damn thing or two to those who don't want to get involved. For instance, The Bride wears a yellow jumpsuit during the last hour of the movie. To the uninitiated, it's just a striking sexy vintage number. To those in the know, it's a replica of Bruce Lee's tracking jumpsuit from his 1979 movie Game of Death. And this is just only a fraction of Tarantino's endless references, in-jokes and homages to old and obscure cinema. From Brian DePalma to Godzilla, from giallo films to Japanese animations, God knows what else are there he injected. I say this movie is an entire pop culture of pop culture.<br />Even without this quality, it's still deliciously entertaining, boldly creative and visually arresting, it's safe to say that this is an instant classic. No, this is not an Oscar-winning movie, let alone be nominated. But not everything has to have a deep storyline with complex characters to be a great film. This movie has no substance and as empty as a dead shell. But it's an amazingly great film, nonetheless. The fact of the matter is that Tarantino made this with great respect, love and passion of the medium, that he practically utilizes everything to its full advantage from complicated camera shots (the long tracking shot of The Bride going to the washroom is incredible), beautiful cinematography (the claustrophobic and filthy Hospital environment, the beautifully exotic and bright Japanese backdrop), the amazing eclectic selections of music (from Nancy Sinatra's \\"Bang, Bang\\" to \\"The Green Hornet\\" theme song) and the excellently choreographed fight scenes as if we're watching an amazing, exhausting ballet dance with swords. Oh yeah, and the beautiful gushing of the blood and gore like water coming down from Niagara Falls. <br />\\"Kill Bill: Volume One\\" is an extravagant, highly-stylized, ultra-energized, uber-violent piece of celluloid. It's made up of a world were grativity is without law, violence is sheer poetry, pissed-off Caucasian women likes to play with samura swords, and even assassins have feelings. It's a world where obscure 1970's disco music goes perfectly seamless along with the motion of decapitation and maiming. <br />Oh what fun!<br />Aside from that movie that left me with tears featuring hobbits and wizards and that fetus-looking boy-fish who seems to say the word \\"Precciooooooussssss....\\" a lot, this year belongs to Kill Bill: Volume One (and I cannot wait for Volume 2!)<br />Thank you, Tarantino for your sick and twisted mind.
B00018D44U|5.0|Although there isn't a single song that is quite so captivating as 'Don't Know Why' from her first album, there is a greater depth in 'Feels Like Home', I think. If this had been her first album, would she have achieved the same popularity? Probably not, no. But I think that most people who had a true appreciation for the first, rather than just a passing fancy for it, will find this one every bit as good.<br />Highlights for me included Above Ground, Toes, and Those Sweet words. My favourite though would have to be Humble Me. This is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time. The music is not so very compelling as that of some others perhaps, but the lyrics are very well written (it has almost a poetic feel at times, and there are none of the cringe moments I often feel with many song lyrics) and Norah's interpretation and execution of it are exquisite. A sad song, but without self pity or bitterness. Truly lovely.<br />There have been a few remarks on 'Creepin In', the duet with Dolly Parton. It's actually my least favourite song on the album, but that has nothing to do with Dolly. Indeed, I think her presence on it saves the song a little, as it at least gives it some novelty value and takes attention away from the fact that it really is rather a bland song. I think the album would have been better without either this song or Dolly Parton, but given the inclusion of both, better that she sing on this song than any other.<br />If there were the option, I would actually have given this album 4.5 stars, as I think that better reflects my opinion of it. But given a choice between 4 or 5... well, given that I've been playing this near constantly since the day it came out, a 4 would have been a little uncharitable ;).
B00008AY3L|2.0|I consider myself to be a big fan of Ben Harper, have all of his albums and love his live shows.  However, this album was a major disappointment.  The fact that it deviates from the jamming style of his live performances is not the deciding factor; compared with his other works, it lacks originality in theme, lyrics, and style and simply sounds disjointed.  Even more disappointing is the song \\"Touch From Your Lust,\\" an excellent song live but one which sounds terribly amateurish and botched on the album.  If you haven't heard the live version of this song you're missing out.  Though not necessarily a bad thing, this album is not characteristic of Harper's usual work, and I recommend any of his other albums over this one.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye came up looking like a genius with this CD.  Some of the more stand out tracks were &quot;Spaceship&quot; &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; &quot;Through The Wire&quot;.  Even the booklet is something interesting.  I highly recomend this, one of the best in this early decade.
B00000294R|5.0|What is there to say?<BR>Big L was the greatest lyricist ever. Tight flow, delivery, punchlines and metas on every single track.<BR>Dark beats throughout, as well as the classic MVP..<BR>This album is one of the greatest of all time.. fact.<BR>He still remains unmatched to this day.<BR>If you are a real hip hop head, you probably already own this.. if not.. get it asap.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Curious as to what she had been doing during her brief hiatus, I bought Ms., briefly Mrs.,Spear's latest album. I wasn't expecting much and after listening to it on the way home from the store, realized that I had been right. The album was complete and utter trash. I was tempted to toss the disc right out the car window. Then, however, the disc began to play again and I was sucked in. I began to realize it wasn't half bad.<br />Me Against the Music:3 Stars. Not a bad way to start off the album.<BR>I Got That (Boom Boom): 3 Stars. Catchy.<BR>Showdown.1 Star. Filler.<BR>Breathe on Me: No Stars. My least favorite song by Britney EVER.<BR>Early Morning: 5 Stars. One of the most unusual songs she's ever done, but it works incredibly well.<BR>Toxic:4 Stars. The wild Indian vibe...I like.<BR>Outrageous:5 Stars. Poking fun at herself.<BR>Touch of My Hand: 4 Stars. Suprisingly good, but I have a feeling she did it for the shock value/attention she knew it would garner.<BR>The Hook Up: 5 Stars. Just fun.<br />Shadow.3 Stars. The better of the album's 2 ballads.<BR>Brave New Girl:6 Stars. the best song from the cd.<BR>Everytime: 1 Star. Justin's version of this song was better. ALOT better.<BR>MATM Remix:0 Stars. Filler.
B0001906O0|5.0|this is a dream come true for me.  some of the remixes can go but other than that it is worth buying.  this is not for the casual cure fan, its only for the hard core Cure fans like myself.
B000089RVX|5.0|I orginally bought this CD thinking it would be ok, I don't really like hard rocks that much but I've heard a few of their songs on radio so I bought the CD thinging that I had probably heard all of the best tracks on the radio already. Needless to say I was very pleasantly surprised when I poped the CD in and started listening to it. All of the songs follow the hard rock with guitars and bass that you have heard on the radio with a few slow songs that are excellent as well mixed in-between. Great guitars, solid bass, and great vocals make this one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. Almost of the songs are well crafted and could have been hits on their own, none of those &quot;filler&quot; songs just stuck in there to make the CD longer. You are going to listen to all of the tracks on this CD over and over again. This CD is definately a great surprise hit and you won't be dissapointed
B00005T30L|1.0|This movie stinks.  If you like actors seemingly strung out on a bad heroine binge, then this is the movie for you.  The whole time it seemed like they were all wanting to be somewhere else and were just trying to get the stupid movie done so they could get there.  Not much effort, in other words.<br />To summarize: this movie stinks.
B00005JM1F|5.0|...there's way, way more than that here. This film has the kind of stuff that allows you to watch it multiple times and be thoroughly entertained every time. The three leading men are fantastic and when the straight man's lines and delivery are hilarious(Luke Wilson) you know you've got a winner. The movie is also loaded with little moments and bits that help make it shine too, and you quite often don't see the jokes coming. There's plenty of nods to &quot;Animal House&quot;(and one to &quot;The Wanderers&quot;) but it's no rip off, and there's some treats on the soundtrack(Metallica when they were good, Black Flag doing &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, and Will Ferrell singing &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, among others). A must-own and an American comedy classic. Good bonus materials too.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I'm both a Jen Garner and Elektra fan and Im very pleased with Elektra in this movie. Ben, Colin, and Michael Clark Duncan are all great in this movie too, and it's not easy for me to admit that Ben is great in this although dammit he is, but Jen Garner is a favorite of mine and is wonderful as Elektra. The humorous and sexy way they worked Elektra's fighting skills into the story early on in the film, before she officially becomes Elektra Assassin, is sexy and fun. One reviewer missed the whole point of the playground/foreplay fight, but I enjoyed it. Keep scratching your head in confusion buddy. Those who got it know, it's a fun way to show Elektra's fighting prowess and the compatibility between Elektra and Matt. It's not realism, but as Frank Miller might say it's superhero sex and the whole vibe of the scene is fun. As for negative comments about Ms Garner's wardrobe I think she looks great and not that different from her comic character or the way she has looked on Alias. Ms Garner is sexy, strong, smart and talented and so is Elektra so she's a great choice for the role.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|This album isn't Strummer's best release since Sandinista.  It's his best release since London Calling.<br />Incredible.<br />There isn't a song here I don't thoroughly enjoy.  Although, my favorites would have to be 'coma girl', 'long shadow', 'all in a day', 'redemption song', and 'silver and gold'.  <br />I can't recomend this enough.  Since I got it, I have let several friends borrow it long enough to listen to and have gotten them hooked on not only the Mescaleros but also the Clash and the 101ers.  This is truly some of Strummer's best work.
B000002KGT|5.0|This famous album yielded four major American hits singles, all of which charted in Britain although none of them made the UK top twenty. As things turned out, that didn't matter because the album was very successful at the time and has retained its popularity to this day.<br />Fleetwood Mac began as an all-male blues-rock group with Peter Green among its members but by the time this album was recorded, their line-up and style of music was markedly different. Mick Fleetwood, Lindsay Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie had transformed the group into a mainstream pop-rock group.<br />On this album, they managed to create a slick, radio-friendly sound with songs of the highest quality that also stand the test of time. Christine wrote four songs, while Stevie and Lindsay wrote three each. The remaining song (The chain) is credited to all four members of the group plus J McVie. Lead vocals are shared around and the extra variation adds to the appeal of the album. Christine, Stevie and Lindsay are all great singers who also harmonize well, each providing excellent backup vocals to whoever is lead singer.<br />The four singles were Go your own way, Don't stop (which some of you will remember was used by Bill Clinton as a campaign theme song), Dreams (perhaps the best of the lot here, but not by much because all the songs are great) and You make loving fun. Of course, there are many other fine songs here, some of which were good enough to have been singles, particularly Second hand news, Never going back again, Songbird and Oh daddy.<br />If you are remotely interested in seventies pop-rock music, this is an essential albums.
B00006AW2L|4.0|Aftermath is one of my favorite Rolling Stones albums. It was a landmark album for the band as it was the first Rolling Stones album to consist of all original Jagger/Richards material. The days of doing cover versions of other artist's songs were slowing down as the band was beginning to develop their own style and sound. With original hits over the previous 15 months, such as \\"Heart Of Stone,\\" \\"The Last Time,\\" \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" and \\"Get Off Of My Cloud,\\" Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were developing into a very strong songwriting team. Besides Mick and Keith coming into their own as songwriters, Brian Jones was beginning to show his versatility as a musician as he played several differernt instruments: Indian sitar on \\"Paint It Black,\\" marimbas (African xylophone) on \\"Under My Thumb,\\" and mountain dulcimer on \\"Lady Jane,\\" \\"I Am Waiting,\\" as well as harmonica \\"High And Dry,\\" \\"Goin' Home,\\" and guitar and keyboards. The album also contains the 11-minute blues jam \\"Goin' Home,\\" \\"Doncha' Bother Me,\\" and the hilarious \\"Stupid Girl\\". The album was immediately praised as one of their best albums and has remained a fan favorite from the Brian Jones era. The album has some great pop tunes on it. However, the album does have some songs which don't do much for me like \\"Think,\\" \\"It's Not Easy,\\" and \\"Flight 505\\".  Don't just judge the Rolling Stones by their radio hits, some of their studio albums have a lot of hidden gems, and this is one of them. The sound has been greatly improved for SACD as part of ABKCO Records \\"Rolling Stones Remastered Series\\". I highly recommend this album.<br />HISTORICAL REFERENCE<br />The album peaked at #2 on the US charts. The Aftermath sessions also produced the hit singles \\"19th Nervous Breakdown,\\" \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" and \\"Paint It Black\\" in the US. Many songs on this album were also covered by other British artists at the time like The Zombies, Chris Farlowe, The Searchers, and others. The 11-minute \\"Goin' Home\\" is what inspired The Doors to make their song \\"The End\\" over 11-minutes long. The album was recorded entirely at RCA Studios in Hollywood, the same studio where Elvis Presley had once recorded, during two separate sessions, one in December 1965 and the other in March 1966. It was also the first Rolling Stones album recorded entirely in the United States, and it was also the first Stones album released in Stereo.pired The Doors to make their song \\"The End\\" over 11-minutes long.

0679745653|3.0|I can't tell you that this is a good book, but I can tell you that has a strong message: you can do whatever you want to do without hurting anybody and you will have an easier life, but if you hurt yourself while living this way, you will lost everything you have, because you will not like anything that you have until you lose it.<br />The story of Holly is like many real stories that I know, so the only person who really know if she were happy or not is Holly.<br />The book is easy to read but not as good as I thought.
0385504209|5.0|This was just a great book. I have seen it on the BestSeller list since the dawning of time so for my latest trip, I made this my book  of choice.<br />I began it Thursday evening and had it finished by Sunday. I just could not put it down. The theories were so refreshing and new, every page brought a new surprise, the story flowed so well. My only disappointment was that I finished the book and no longer can look at it with new eyes, and read the story for the first time.<br />Just a great, great book. There was only one aspect that I predicted correctly. Everything else was a surprise (and an education).<br />Don't miss out on this book!!!!
B00006CXSS|1.0|Although an excellent production, it's more about the typical GI Joe film, where a bunch of undisciplined, unmotivated, overpaid and overfed army, defeats it's enemy with very dubious tactics and elements. The film is more about history being written by the victorious, in plain disregard of true historic facts, instead of an objective review. It's another happy ending americana. Proper viewer caution is advised.
B00005JMCT|1.0|I would rather suck on a tail-pipe than watch this film again. If you like the first two films, and you are not moron, then I can assure you that you will hate this film. It was like the writers and the actors just stopped caring.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This is a thriller with a brain. I enjoyed the suspense. Some scenes were gory but overall the violence wasn't gratuitous. I recommend it.
B00018D44U|1.0|I REALLY loved &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and eagerly awaited Jones' next CD. Her sultry, smokey voice is alive and well. It's the material that kills this new CD. You could just fall asleep listening to it -- and not in a good way -- out of boredom. I'm just completely disappointed. There isn't a single track that measures up to anything from her first CD. She needs SONGWRITERS -- fast. I'd hate to think of her as a one-CD wonder.
0316666343|4.0|The book Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is the novel about Susie Salmon, a murdered teenage girl. The most interesting part about the book is that its told from Susies point of view in heaven while shes looking down on her friends and family. She watches as her family copes with her death and the search to find her murderer, who happens to be her strange neighbor. The beginning of the book is rather graphic and as it describes her rape and death in detail and makes you sympathize with the character. Then from heaven, she watches as her father searches for her killer, making the book suspenseful. We see how Susie gets frustrated because her killer continues to live only a few houses away from her family. She watches her friends and family grieve and even break down but eventually start living their lives without her in their own different ways. She has to slowly accept the fact that she died young and didnt get to do many things that she always dreamt to. She talks about all the things with her friend in heaven and watches as her family and friends get to experience it on earth. There is one rather strange and confusing part however, the book is really touching because it deals with issues that happen everyday and people can relate to it and bring up personal feelings.  Overall, book is good read thatll make you laugh and cry. The ending also has an interesting twist, which closes the book well.
6301967992|5.0|Polanski did a superb job of spoofing Dracula/vampire hunting movies in TFVK. I actually prefer this vampire movie to ones that feature blood and gore.  TFVK is one of my favorite vampire flicks; i put it right up there with BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA and DRACULA 1979 (featuring Frank Langella).Polanksi plays the bumbling assistant of a dotty old vampire killer.  While they contemplate the best way to take down the local vampire, they encounter Sarah, played by Sharon Tate, the innkeeper's beautiful daughter.  Polanski promptly falls in love with her; little does he know she's one of the undead!Like many other people, I am drawn to this story because of Sharon Tate and the tragic end her own story would come to a handful of years after this film was released...

B00003CXCT|5.0|I can't believe some of these reviews involving the upcoming DVD release of the \\"Star Wars\\" Special Edition Trilogy, what is exactly wrong with the SE versions???!!, this one (A New Hope) had most of the changes, but they were in my view needed, we see more of Mos Eisley which now looks like a Metropolis, which is cool, why is this a bad thing??, the bloch under the Landspeeder is now gone, why is this a crime, Greedo shooting first??, so what, the scene was designed to show what a good marksman Han really is, yes, I agree, the Jabba scene could have been better, but a neat scene nonetheless, & Boba Fett thrown in for good measure was nice, Han facing down a legion of Stormtroopers on the Death Star was a nice change, I say again, what is the problem here???, & the end battle is now soooooo much better, are you people telling me that the X-Wings & Tie Fighters on sticks are better than the digital ones???, the new sequences are more realistic looking than the older version, Lucas took nothing away from the film, he just made it better, & \\"Empire\\" with more shots of Bespin were cool, again, nothing was taken away from the Original film, & \\"Jedi\\", the Jabba dance number is better with more interesting characters, & the end sequence is sooooo much better, I am glad Lucas & Co. got rid of that ridiculous Ewok song, I hated that song, the new ending is much more surreal with celebrations everywhere, again, why is this a bad thing??, It seems to me that the ones complaining about the SE films are the same ones who complain about the Prequels, & don't appreciate the art of filmaking, like Lucas does, as far as Speilberg's E.T., its new version made little or no money, which is why he probably released both versions, not so with \\"Star Wars\\", before 1997, I too felt that the films needed improvemnets, & my interest was renewed that year,  I will take the SE over the originals any day!!
076790592X|5.0|I loved this novel.  Almost everyone has someone that has inspired them in one way or another.  I felt drawn to Morrie.  His character was truly inspirational.  I wish there were millions more people like Morrie in this world.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Like most of you, `Are you gonna be my girl' was all I knew from these guys when I bought this album. What can I say, this is a true rock album, kind of like `The Darkness' but with a much better singer. If you like your Rock'n'Roll the way it was played in the 70's (say Drums, Bass, Guitars and a singer with an attitude) then this album was made for you :<br />Last Chance - rocks off ! A simple riff and a perfect opener for this album.<br />Are you gonna be my girl - Yes - that's the one from the radio and it is dirty, fast, pure adrenaline Rock'n'Roll. One of my favorite tracks from 2003.<br />Rollover DJ - A dirty guitar riff over a nice rockin' groove. Reminds me a bit of the Quireboys without the scratchy voice.<br />Look what you've done - The first ballad on this album. Since I bought the CD to get some dirty Rock'n'Roll this does not blow me off my seat and will not make it to my iPod.<br />Get what you need - A guitar riff that could have come from Keith Richards himself circa `It's only Rock'n'Roll'. A nice, rough production - definitely a keeper.<br />Move on - The next ballad, this time Jet turn Country. I like this one better than `Look what you've done'. Reminds me a bit of `Izzy Stradlin' in his more mellow phase.<br />Radio Song - Yet, another ballade, but with the fuzzy guitar during the chorus and the great guitar solo in the middle, it still rocks quite a bit.<br />Get me outta here - Finally, they rock again... a typical 70's rocker but still excellent, especially when blasting it out of your car speakers on a sunny day on the freeway.<br />Cold Hard B**** - Keeps rockin'.... <br />Come around again - another slow one that doesn't do much for me.<br />Take it or leave it - The fastest track on the album - fast and furious and the vocals are as hysterical as on `Are you gonna be my girl'. Definitely a winner !<br />Lazy Gun - They definitely were influenced by their fellow Australians from AC/DC when it comes to the riff. However, not one of the best songs on this album, especially since the song takes a strange turn during the bridge.<br />Timothy - Another ballad... the song I like the least on this CD.....<br />I have to point out, that I got exactly what I wanted for my money (minus the couple of ballads that I probably won't be listening to anymore any time soon since they will be stored away in my CD box while the rockers will stay on my iPod). This is a straight forward rock thing, nothing less but nothing more. Music to drive down the road to and to think about the old days, when rock music was played by guys with long hair instead of techno geeks with samplers and drum loops.
0385335482|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this novel.  It's alot funnier than I expected it to be.  I found myself laughing aloud to some of the quirky and desperate situations Becky Bloomwood dug herself into.  The hilarity of this book goes beyond the quirky scenarios and predicaments that Becky manages to get herself into.  What makes this novel so damn addictive and loveable is the leading star herself, Becky.  Sophie Kinsella's writing style and creativity really demonstrates itself with the character development of Becky.  Though she is off the wall, she is somehow quite believeable.  Kinsella has the talent to create an intimacy between the characters and her readers.  I fell in love with Becky from the very start; she became my phantom best friend as the novel progressed.  Though i'm not an excessive shopper like Becky, I could definitely relate to the her fantasizing lapses out of reality.  Confession: Becky Bloomwood is just as, if not more, loveable than Bridget Jones. GASP!
B00011V8CW|4.0|Here's the deal. Black Tie, White Noise is a great album, which, up until recently, has been very hard to get your hands on. This was David's first solo album after breaking up with Tin Machine, and it has a great feel remiscant of &quot;Young Americans.&quot;<br />The album was produced by Nile Rogers, who also produced &quot;Let's Dance&quot; so you might notice some similarities there, too.<br /> The reason I don't give this album five stars is well, the only thing really new on the second CD is the track &quot;Real Cool World&quot; (&quot;Lucy Can't Dance&quot; was included as a bonus track on the original release of the album) which wasn't an outtake from the album, it was the title song for the movie &quot;Real Cool World.&quot; The rest of the remixes are cool if you like remixes, I guess.<br />  And the DVD is okay, it cuts here and there with the interview, which is very very annoying. But the music videos and studio recordings of the songs are great, if you don't already own them from elsewhere.<br />  So, basically, there's nothing on this album that can't be obatained elsewhere (except some remixes) but it's still not a bad compalation.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is definately one of my favorite Maiden CDs, every song is amazing and the lyrics are some of the best Iron Maiden has ever written. The only song I dont like on the CD is The Nomad, but that is made up for by songs like &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, and &quot;Dream of mirrors&quot;. This is arguably their best album and for very good reason. I couldnt take it out of my CD player for weeks.
6305508550|5.0|I'm a US citizen who teaches English in Mexico. My (Mexican) fellow teachers frequently ask me why I left the &quot;American Dream&quot; behind in order to work for a low salary at a university in Baja, and they always seem rather unwilling to accept my portrait of life in corporate America. I first watched this eerily realistic spoof on TV a couple of years ago, and I intend to order it for our school library with the hope that watching it will convince both students and teachers that life in the US isn't all that it's cracked up to be.<br />If the movie weren't so hilarious and extreme, it would almost qualify as a docudrama. It is very well cast and acted, and I must agree with the reviewer who finds it to be underrated.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.. It is still haunting me days after I watched it. The film techniques, the soundtrack, the way you get caught up in the actors' scenarios is brilliant. Bill Murray was absolutely amazing, he made me feel like I was right there with him in tokyo, and the relationship that the two had was so moving and heartfelt, I wanted to keep following them more and more to see what would happen next. The ending scene was heartbreaking and beautiful, and the fact that Coppola did not let the audience hear what Bill Murray whispers into her ear made it even more alluring to me. It leaves you to imagine what may have been said, and what could happen to these two lost souls AFTER the movie is over and in their future lives. It left me wanting more, and that is the markings of a good film. The scenes in Tokyo and the relationships with the citizens there were not only hilarious, but heartwarming. I absolutely recommend this movie.
B00001OH7P|5.0|It's pretty impossible to ignore this albums importance in the history of Rock and Roll. Bowie was famous before this, sure. But this is what made him an international supoerstar, where he has remained ever since.<br /> This album is supposed to be a story, the story of Ziggy Stardust, and well, it follows a story as close as any of Bowie's attempts ever did. Since every other review tells you about how great the album is, I'll tell you a bit about the story, if I can.<br /> 1. Five Years -- The album's opener, in which we find out there are just five years left on earth, and Bowie tells us how everyone is reacting to it. \\"A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that.\\" The best part is, Bowie brings the listener themselves into the song, in an ice cream parlor. A great storytelling element.<br /> 2. Soul Love -- A great tune, first and foremost. But a bit hard to relate to the Ziggy Stardust story. A mother is at the grave of her dead son who died for a great cause. The priest we met in Five Years is present, and Bowie also talks a bit about the meaning of love. A good story, and I'm sure in Bowie's mind it fits in here somehow.<br /> 3. Moonage Daydream -- Here we get the first true rocking sound of the album, and the first appearance of Ziggy Himself, announcing his presence and greatness.<br /> 4. Starman -- The first single off of the album and what really launched Bowie, when he performed this song on \\"Top of the Pops,\\" a British tv program. A good jam, extremely memorable, in which Ziggy relates the news of a Starman out in the sky that might be able to save humanity.<br /> 5. It Ain't Easy -- The only cover on Ziggy Stardust, and thusly not really in the storyline at all, but fitting in with the theme pretty well. This song was elected to replace either \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" or \\"Sweet Head\\", both of which did not make the album for some reason or another.<br /> 6. Lady Stardust -- This beautiful ballad tells us about Ziggy's attempt to become a star, and how poorly the crowd recieves his difference at first, even though it was \\"really out of sight.\\"<br /> 7. Star -- Now we see the frustration of Ziggy himself, he wishes to be a star, and he knows he can make it. And as the album progresses, he will.<br /> 8. Hang Onto Yourself -- The band is beginning to make it big, and they're liking it. \\"If you think you're gonna make it, you'd better hang on to yourself!\\"<br /> 9. Ziggy Stardust -- Perhaps one of the best rock and roll songs of all time, Ziggy is huge, he wows the crowd and everyone loves him ... but the Spiders get jealous. And thusly Ziggy's fame brings about his own downfall.<br /> 10. Suffregette City -- A lovely little rocker, which, as far as most can tell, has nothing to do with the Ziggy Story at all.<br /> 11. After the inevitable fall of Ziggy, he just can't take it anymore and takes his own life.<br /> Bowie himself has toyed with the idea of making this into a play many times, but always abandoned it in favor of doing something else. However, what with Broadway musicals of Abba, Queen, and Billy Joel, I'm sure you'll eventually see this onstage. But it is a fantastic five star album. For casual listeners, this is a must.

B0000AM6LY|5.0|When I heard &quot;Sunrise&quot; on a smooth jazz station, I was surprised to hear it was Simply Red.  I love Mick's voice in this song.  Then when I bought the CD, I have to say, it is the best CD I have heard in a long time.  I usually don't like remake songs, but &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot; is almost as good as when Bob Dylan sings it.  My favorites are &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;Money in my Pocket&quot;.  I would strongly suggest this CD for any jazz or easy listening music fan.
B000089RVX|5.0|What makes Evanescence such a novelty in the music world is that their musc has all the elements of hard rock yet instead of a screeching, incoherent voice shouting the lyrics, they lay over their guitars female vocals that sound like something you might hear on a Dido album. The lead singer's haunting and frosty voice makes their music something you can rock out to and also enjoy and gain some insight to. They have all-out rock songs like radio staple &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;Going Under,&quot; as well as delicate ballads such the amazing &quot;My Immortal,&quot; something you would not expect to hear from a hard rock band. This band has succeeded because they have realized that they can be hardcore as well as interesting and thoughtful.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I had epected something more to be perfectly honest. Yes, sure, the acting is good, and all the actors are very well cast; not the least Richard Gere.<BR>  What I lacked was a solid story, and likeable characters. Everyone is just out for themselves, and they let nothing get in their way. Is this how the American Dream should be? The only character that is sympathetic has really only one line and is hanged in the middle of the film.<BR>  If you want to watch a film about how shroddy the American Dream is, and how unfair its system of justice is, then this might be the film for you. If you want a nice song and dance film I would recommend Moulin Rogue, or Cabaret.
B000002UA0|5.0|Like a lot of bands, the original lineup was always the best. I really miss Syd Barrett. He had his own style of playing, and really made some great tunes with Pink Floyd. This is by far the best Floyd album there is. Psychadelic children's music is the best way to describe it. The best songs are Astronomy Domine, Interstellar Overdrive, and Bike. What I like about this album is that all the ambiences are done by the band. There are no ridicoulous soundbytes like in later albums, and of course, the guitar playing is incredible. Syd Barrett is a really underrated guitar player. He isn't afraid to use dissonance and make his guitar sound otherworldy. Plus, there's some really great riffs that are almost metal. The best Floyd album, before they went butt rock with Dark Side Of The Moon. GET IT NOW!
B000025RX4|1.0|Really with an lp featuring Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer you would expect a top notch effort but this album fails to impress.<BR>It's almost as if you want to like the songs but they fade into a scramble of noise and poor songwriting.<BR>Even Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo sounds terrible.<BR>Honestly nothing here to recommend.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|So, lots of people have told you how terrific this movie is (except those that didn't understand it).  I highly second those glowing reviews.<br />Just two things, though:<br />First, if Leonard can't remember anything since he and his wife were attacked, why does he remember his &quot;condition&quot; and explain it to everyone he meets?  He seems to never need prompting on this point - he doesn't even have a tatoo explaining it.  So, how could he remember it, since it happened after the attack and he can't remember anything he does, says, has done to him or said to him from that point on?<br />For this reason I gave it four stars.  Otherwise it's excellent, and deserves multiple watchings.<br />One other thing: At the end of the movie we see flashbacks (?) of Leonard with his wife.  There is a new tatoo on his chest that isn't there throughout the entire movie: &quot;I DID IT&quot;.  This was alluded to as a tatoo he would give to himself after killing his wife's murderer.<br />So, was his wife really dead?  Was it all an act (remember, he accused his client of acting, right?)?  Was he dreaming of his wife being alive after his vengence?  Is this just a left-curve thrown in by the filmmaker to confuse us?<br />An enigma inside an enigma....<br />I also liked the menu &quot;clues&quot; - very clever, extending the story outside the bounds of the film itself....<br />Also, Guy Pearce could be my best friend's twin brother... very surreal watching him....<br />-
B00005QW5X|5.0|From the very start with &quot;Tear Me Down,&quot; Hedwig gets off to a rocking start.  This is a movie I'd heard lots about, but wasn't sure I'd be into or not.  I love glam rock, but have never cared at all for Rocky Horror.<br />I found myself enjoying the movie from the outset and loving it more and more as I watched.  Hedwig's story is interesting, has humor and the songs really stand out.  Best of all on the DVD is the feature that lets you jump to each individual song in the movie.  I rented this first since I wasn't sure I'd love it, but quickly went and bought it after watching it once.  This is one I'll be watching many times.
1400031354|5.0|If &quot;brevity is the soul of wit&quot;, then McCall Smith has a huge soul and endless wit.  In this second volume of Botswana intrigue, he carries forward the characters established in &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot;.  Mma Ramotswe maintains her role as &quot;traditional&quot; Botswana lady  in both girth and personality.  Her fiance, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, however, gains in stature, revealed as  a man of small confusions and immense strengths.  A few worthy [and unworthy] supporters flesh out the cast.  Overall looms the figure of an American mother seeking Mma Ramotswe's aid in tracking down her lost son.  A decade of searching revealed nothing.  Can she actually succeed where so many others have failed?  And in so few pages?<br />With a marriage offer given and accepted, Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni enter a new level in their relationship.  Both have houses and businesses.  Will there be a clash over priorities?  Both have domestic and business staff.  How will those people be dealt with?  Finally, distant and faintly present, is the question marriage inevitably raises - what about a family?  McCall Smith deals with all these issues as he follows the interacting threads of the  lives of the lady detective and gentle-hearted mechanic.<br />Through it all radiates the presence of African traditions.  How to greet people.  How to offer and accept gifts.  How to present solutions to a client's problems when none of the options avoid hurting someone else?  When isn't it a sin to lie or even blackmail a person?  These aren't simple questions at the best of times and in the society of Botswana, they loom as an ever-present reality.  Clearly, McCall Smith is intimately familiar with these and other aspects of African life.  Yet, while his characters live in a different world, their problems and approach to life are hardly alien.  Still, there is a reason for a giraffe's tears - a reason we all need to learn.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]
B00018D44U|5.0|I don't get what the other reviewers have said about Norah's effort on this CD being too dull or slow. Did you buy her last album? To put it plainly, it has a very similar sound to Come Away With Me, which means 1 of 2 things: 1) you listen to your old Norah CD a lot, appreciate her style, and will add this to your rotation, pleased with the refreshing variety of Norah you now own, or 2) you will find it too similar to the CD you already own and don't listen to a lot, and wish you hadn't bought more of the same.<br />But really, what can you expect? The songs on the album match Norah's voice well and provide a great atmosphere for relaxing around the house. If don't own Come Away With Me (or listen to it a lot), you won't be bored by the songs included here. I'll give it to you that if she doesn't changer her pace soon or include some more jazzy numbers on her CDs in the future, her sound is going to get old, but it's idiotic for former fans to knock her for doing the same thing they used to applaud.
B00018D44U|3.0|Like many people, I loved her first album and eagerly awaited her second.  Unfortunately, despite multiple listens, I have failed to find anywhere near the same quality of music as in &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  The production values are impeccable, but the problem with &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is that it's ultimately a forgettable and bland collection of lazy Sunday afternoon tunes.  Norah's voice is terrific and her band is quite competent, but the songwriting is really quite predictable and almost cliched at times (I read that unlike &quot;Come Away&quot;, Norah herself actually wrote most of the songs in this one...  Bad sign).  Whereas &quot;Come Away&quot; was chock-full of emotive, catchy and soulful pieces, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; feels like coffee shop background music: unobtrusive, soft and devoid of any real emotion.  Doesn't make it a bad album (it's good chill out music), but it really disappointed me.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is not only an imaginative and artistically directed story, but humorous and uplifting in its presentation. For this reason alone, the movie is unique. Too many Sundance films focus on the negative underbelly of life, but Amelie is refreshing, well-acted and brilliantly directed and filmed. It combines the positivity and sweetness of Life is Beautiful (another favorite) with the vision and style of Moulin Rouge. <br />This is one of the only movies that my parents and siblings (age 25-65) all enjoy. It's quirky and creative, but still accessible for anyone, even those who aren't big fans of foreign films. Take the 2 hours, tough out having to &quot;read&quot; a movie, and you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKCH|4.0|SPIDER-MAN was the the #1 film of 2002; it was a blockbuster liked by critics and loved by audiences (especially kids). But after repeated viewings, the movie becomes a bit stale for me after awhile.<br />The film's good points though are Tobey Maguire's solid potrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as the lovely MJ. The bad points were the wearisome Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was good though) and the pathetic dialogue this film has, especially by the villian. It was a bit long as well.<br />I'm giving it four stars though because of the way it looked like when I first saw it. It was fun, somewhat exciting, and the performances were grand. And also because I like Sam Raimi, the director, because he made a favorite movie of mine before. It was DARKMAN. It was way better then SPIDER-MAN, but Raimi did a good job at building a comic-book atmosphere for this movie.<br />Every kid in this world has flocked around this movie, which is a bit annoying for me. It's not better then the more plausible X-MEN 2, but it was good enough for a viewing.
0790733226|5.0|Off the bat, be aware that Contact is not an &quot;alien&quot; movie, but so much more. Within the first minute of this film, you know you are about to watch something completely original. (Just for the beginning this is worth watching, as it deserves the award of best opening sequence ever (with Memento a close second)) It focuses on the struggles that Ellie (Foster) faces as a scientist grappling with losses of those close to her, opposition from her superiors and peers, and her atheistic attitude toward life. The movie ultimately focuses on the concept that, whatever you want to call it, there is &quot;more&quot; out there.<br />Foster does a great job of acting, and while the movie runs long at 2 1/2 hours, it's an interesting and unique story. More dramatic than action-packed, Contact is touching in its telling and will make you think about the possibilities that lie out there.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|did anyone notice that some of the music was in gladiator too? i was watching it with a friend, and the music came on and we were all whoa, pirates of the carribean music! just a funny little thing i found.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This movie may quite possibly be my favorite of all time, and for anyone familiar with Romeo &amp; Juliet, you will love the humor, drama &amp; insight this provides. With its award for best original screenplay, Mark Norman &amp; Tom Stoppard raised the bar with this film, seamlessly incorporating the play Romeo &amp; Juliet with the &quot;events&quot; from Shakespeare's life that inspired the play. While it is historical fiction, it's a great story to be told. I can't say enough about how much or how often I've enjoyed this film, and never tire at seeing the plots of this play within a play come together and make you appreciate Shakespeare more than ever.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a page turning, interesting book. The book is about a Andalusian shepherd boy called Santiago going on this journey trying to find the &quot;treasure&quot;. On this journey he meets people that teach him things, shape his life. One of the person he meets is this girl Fatima which he falls in love with, in the end he realizes that love isn't everything and that he should carry on with the journey. This book tells you that it is how you do it that's important not what you get at the end. If you tried you hardest to do something and didn't get it, its okay, but you know you have gave it a shot. This book also shows how we should trust our hearts, that we should fulfill our dream. Like the crystal merchant, another person Santiago met on the journey, he was one person who taught him a lot. Crystal merchants were suppose to go to Mecca at least once, and this one made enough money so that he could afford the trip but he didn't go, because he thought if he left this place, he wouldn't fulfill his dream of being a merchant.<BR>I truly recommend this book to people who enjoy reading things about life, mystery, adventure. It is a serious book with barely any jokes. People who are looking for a good book that is short, and enjoy mystery this is the book for you.
B000001FHV|4.0|I'll admit I'm not a Meat Puppets expert, but this is a great album. These guys don't exactly remind me of Dinosaur Jr., but they do in the way that they're punk and country, as much as they are grunge. They put it all together well. Sometimes I feel this album has a fairly generic mid-90's alt-rock sound, but other times it seems pretty impressive and unique. It's somewhere inbetween I suppose. Anyway, \\"Backwater\\" was the big catchy hit off this, but the whole disc is just as good. Also, the hidden track is \\"Lake Of Fire\\", which was covered of course by Nirvana. This could be their best album, but even if it's not, I still suggest you get \\"Too High To Die\\".
0061015725|1.0|I am a huge Michael Crichton fan.  I've loved him since I read &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in three days when I was ten.  Twelve years later and I can reread his novels again and again.  &quot;Prey&quot; was a HORRIBLE disappointment.  It seemed as if he had merely gone through some first drafts of earlier books and cut and pasted them together.  The first person narrative was extremely ineffective (Crichton's never done this before, for good reason apparently.)  To be honest, I'm sort of embarrassed for him.  Oh well, I've got my fingers crossed for the next one...
B000005IU2|4.0|When putting together your essential punk album collection, make sure this one is there. &quot;The Stooges&quot; may not have the fame of other giants in the genre, but they're just as good, and influential. There's something about the way these guys played, and &quot;Iggy Pop's&quot; delivery, that seems very real, and very primal. &quot;Down On The Street&quot; and &quot;Loose&quot; are excellent rockers, and &quot;Dirt&quot; has a slow groove to it that's very cool and hypnotic. Their other albums may have a better song or two, but this one is the best front to back. It may not sound as hardcore as it did 34 years ago, but it's still better than most everything today.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Now, many genuine reviews on this record are hiding in the middle of nowhere on this site whereas Nick's appeal to the higher species (read: Radiohead fans) might make him the top reviewer one day. What most people seem to forget: Not liking   &quot;OK Computer&quot; is as much an opinion as liking it. Music is -like all art- a matter of personal (dis)taste and thus subject to discussion. There'll never be a &quot;best album ever&quot;, so we all better tolerate each other.<br />As for my opinion on &quot;OK Computer&quot;: It's a very good album, at times even great. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is the proof that ambition can sound excellent, the outstanding track on the record. Another highlights are &quot;Exit Music (For a film)&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot;. The music is very poignant and captivating, the lyrics sharp-witted with a dark hue of humor. If this is where modern rock is heading, I'll jump on this train. The use of machines captures the zeitgeist very well. Radiohead have mastered matching good traditional songwriting with futuristic visions. John Frusciante plays a stripped-to-the-bone version of &quot;Lucky&quot; on his live shows and it still sounds terrific. This shows Radiohead are not the pretentious pseudo-artists they 're sometimes portrayed as.<br />I give this album 4.5 stars- there are some songs I love and some tracks I don't enjoy that much (&quot;Electioneering&quot;, &quot;Airbag&quot;, &quot;The Tourist&quot; don't have that substance). &quot;OK Computer&quot; has seldom been on my heavy rotation list- I usually listen to it once a month. That's why my rating strays towards 4 stars.
055357342X|3.0|Ok, I like the books. They are fun reads, even if they seem to be going in circles. Everyone crossing each other's paths as they keep crisscrossing the same terrain. Arya's never-ending journey to get somewhere...anywhere, is a little annoying. Still, it's been fairly enjoyable and you get addicted, like a soap opera I guess :-). At times it's slow and overly descriptive...but,thats the fantasy genre I guess. I wish someone would rape and kill Sansa tho.<br />Anyhow, I just finished reading Jordan's endless wheel of time series, up to book 10(it ain't ever gonna end, btw), in a matter of about 6 months. When I heard people saying this series was better written and more entertaining, I thought I'd give it a try.<br />My first impression...is Jordan and Martin the same person?<br />They sure as heck write alike. Wolves, Inn's and common rooms, mulled wine, light vs. dark, even some of the names of characters are the same. The style looks not similar...they look exactly the same.<br />Now, they are different stories...true. WOT starts strong on fantasy, and bogs down into politics. This series does the reverse...starts strong into politics, and the action and magic are becoming more visible as the story progesses. Tho, there is more action, more frequently in this series than the WOT, which makes each chapter more enjoyable...the style it's written in is almost identical. WOT has just become a bore...while this one hasn't done that...yet.<br />Have Jordan and Martin ever been seen together in the same place...at the same time? Just curious :-)<br />Now, these are fun books. Enjoyable time wasters. But, c'mon people...this is not great art or even the pinnacle of the genre. It's fairly predictable and almost a fantasy genre cookie cutter production. That's not necessarily a bad thing...it's a fun book, and gives fantasy readers what they are looking for. But, it sure as heck ain't no Tolken...not even close.<br />Enjoy it for what it is...I recommend the series, for now. Pray it doesn't go the way of WOT.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Remember the old &quot;love it or hate it&quot; factor? Applicable to film, books, music, or just about any facet of human expression, this is one of those films that fits in the category.<br />Honestly, I tried to enjoy this movie, knowing the rave reviews it was given, with one of my favorite actors in it and the daughter of the famed Francis Ford Coppola directing it. Even going through the tough first half hour, I thought to myself to &quot;keep searching&quot; for the film's meaning, to judge it by its own standards and not bring in biases that the typical American film brings to the masses. Unfortunately, I just couldn't do it.<br />As other have pointed out, it felt that Coppolla was just stretching out the introduction of the characters in the first 30 minutes. Although many scenes were amusing, sometimes hilarious (and no, I didn't think for one moment it was racist), it got old when I kept questioning where the film was being directed. Scene after pointless scene was handed to me. Finally, when the two characters meet, I had thought that some kind of story would start. Very little changes, as the two characters simply lose themselves in Tokyo's bright lights and foreign atmosphere. Only small handfuls of dialogue felt as if there was real meaning being exchanged between the two characters. I'll give the film some credit. By the end, I felt that there certainly was a subtle connection that had crept into my mind wihtout my noticing. I felt some emotion in their final departure, and rethought the film from this point. But Alas, there was little content to back up the development between the two. <br />My final judgement for the film: two stars. The film was more about the characters than a straightfoward narrative, but I felt little connection to the characters themselves, and the fact that I was waiting for the film to end about 30-45 minutes into it doesn't help it.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I wasn't much of a Superman fan. Not for comics, not for the previous TV Series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;. But a friend of mine recommended me &quot;Smallville&quot;... well, not just 1 but many had recommended it to me.<br />So I give it a try. And watch the entire 21 episodes and to my surprise it was very different. And I found myself holding on to it with the characters, the stories and the best part of all, its the human touch and drama.<br />Everything was well written. The characters were interesting, the story isn't stupid or dumb but intelligent. And for just 21 episodes, it just leaves me back for Season 2 (and where is it?).<br />I feel on the overall basis this is a DVD Boxset you will want to pick up. Its just for everyone to enjoy and its a family TV Series you will just glue yourself on to the TV Screen. Although the extras isn't much, the episodes will keep you going and rooting.<br />get this season to begin with... and you'll feel Superman (before then) has a place in your collection. Believe me... a man can fly.
B0001AP12G|4.0|College drop out is definitely a banging sort of uplifting CD.  Kanye West is an above average rapper but please don't compare him with Jay Z, NAs, Common or Mos Def.  Most of the guest stars steal the show when they guest star on his tracks especially Common, who after his verse on Keep em high, has me anticipating his next CD.  The subject matter explored on this Cd is a breath of fresh air compared to the regular stuff you hear on the radio, but that just proves to me that most of y'all don't really listen to nothing but mainstream hip hop.  MC'S like J live, Lyrics Born, Goodie Mob, and Outkast have all done this kind of album before in the past so this album is not ground breaking.  They say rap is dead the main reason it's dead is because most people who claim they are true hip hop heads too busy listening to Nelly and Fifty Cent to check out the real rap on the indie labels.  I gave it four stars becasue I couldn't give it three point five.  All the tracks are hot excpet New Work out, which is a wack sex jam that doesn't even stick with the analogy the song inspired in the first verse.  By all means pick this up but most of the people that have reviewd this album give him too much credit.
B000059Z8J|4.0|This film will always be important to me because I was a child during the era of these films.  I watched them endlessly on television.  I had a crush on Christopher Reeve for years. I never got enough of these films. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I bought the DVD this weekend and it was worth every penny.<br />Superman will always be a classic film experience. With three sequels, this film was a blockbuster alongside Star Wars and Return of the Jedi.  It's the perfect 80's experience and if you are an eighties kid I suggest you relive those moments by buying all of the Superman films.  I admit it was very sad to watch since Christopher is now confined to a wheelchair for life. I couldn't keep my mind off of his ailment while watching the film. It was sad to think of the eighties and how fast time pasts but this is what makes this movie wonderful...memories.<br />This film is not perfect by all means.  The dialoge is wacky. The special effects are cheap ( but back then they were amazing ). People not used to the film will only concentrate on its faults but it has so much more to offer. It will forever be a classic and one of the most romantic series ever made.  No matter how old or dated these Superman films get it will always be remembered. Not even the upcoming Hollywood remake can change that.  This touched the hearts of millions for over twenty years. No one can top that.
0385504209|4.0|Although, some people say that this book is for eight grader. But I think it is not bad for people like me, who english is not so good.

0345360338|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman is a remarkably gifted writer. Her impeccable historical research, attention to detail and superb storytelling ability make her novels consistently excellent. &quot;Falls The Shadow&quot; is one of her best efforts. It is the third book in her Plantagenet series, which began with &quot;The Sunne In Splendour,&quot; followed by &quot;Here Be Dragons,&quot; and ending with &quot;The Reckoning.&quot; Each of these wonderful historical novels stands on its own, however, and while it is an extraordinary experience to read each book in order, one does not have to do so to appreciate the history, the characters or the period.<br />Simon de Montfort was a nobleman from France, whose family, (originally English-Norman), had been disinherited by King John. A young man in his mid-twenties, he returned to England in 1232 seeking restitution of his family lands from King Henry III, John's son. He wound up marrying Henry's sister, Eleanor Plantagenet and risking the King's and Church's wrath by doing so. De Montfort, who became Earl of Leicester, was a warrior, great leader and politician. He despised Henry III for his incompetence and the favoritism he displayed for the foreigners in his court. Henry was bankrupting England and estranging the peerage. Far ahead of his time, Simon de Montfort also espoused the idea that the common man deserved a voice in government. England was on the verge of civil war as factions split between Henry and his son and heir Edward. The collision of blood ties, politics and war, shifting allegiances, along with the pageantry and drama of life in the Middle Ages, make this novel hard to put down.<br />Intertwined with the story of Simon de Montfort is that of Welsh Prince Llewelyn Farr, who united the Welsh nobility against the English. Wales was also in a state of civil unrest at the time, as Llewelyn had just died and his sons were fighting for leadership and power, thereby losing everything their father had gained to the English. What makes the Welsh part of the story even more interesting, is that not only is Welsh history linked to that of England's, but the royal families, Kings John and Henry, and Prince Llewelyn's are linked by blood. Ms. Penman joins the histories and characters of these two countries to give the reader, not just a superb tale but a look at the bigger historical picture also.<br />I highly recommend this book, and the all the others in the series, as this is some of the best historical fiction I have ever read.<br />JANAWhat makes the Welsh part of the story even more interesting, is that not only is Welsh history linked to that of England's, but the royal families, Kings John and Henry, and Prince Llewelyn's are linked by blood.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|There is a curious cinematic form that has emerged in the last few years, which is akin to the Moebius Strip.  In such films, past shades into future, cause and effect are interchangeable, and the film loops around neatly (and shockingly) to reveal that it is really a sort of closed alternate universe. Examples include Lost Highway, Memento, 12 Monkeys, and now Donnie Darko.<br />One of its charms (and frustrations) is that, like Vanilla Sky, you are never certain just what sort of film it is you are watching until the end.  It reveals itself slowly - layer by layer.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a likeable young man troubled by what is probably paranoid schizophrenia.  Refreshingly, his parents (played by Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnel), are not the usual teen flick dummies.  The family, while a bit dysfunctional, manages to remain cohesive and loving.  This is important.  The film would function as a sympathetic treatment of mental illness even if it did not have other goals in mind.<br />Darko has strange visions and visitations.  He sleepwalks, and finds himself waking up in odd places.  Most disturbing, he seems to hallucinate a guy named Frank in a macabre bunny suit, who tells him that the world will end in 28 days.  It does not take long to figure out that he's referring to Darko's world, not the world as a whole.<br />To enjoy this film, one needs to understand two things: the events, though strange, are leading to a definite, coherent conclusion; and - importantly - the audience is asked to participate in fitting the pieces of the puzzle together.  There is no character given the task of explaining it to the audience to make sure we get it.  That there is an answer, and that it's slyly revealed through seemingly inexplicable pieces doled out in the course of the story, is a testament to the skill of first-time writer-director Richard Kelly.<br />As plenty of other reviews here make clear, there are many people who lack the patience for this sort of thing.  If you are one of them, you have been warned. You will probably find Donnie Darko both perplexing and pointless. But if you enjoy puzzles, if you find yourself trying to second guess where films are going as you watch, then you will probably find this film enjoyable.<br />Although I didn't think Donnie Darko was very profound, I did find it moving.  Jake Gyllenhaal embodies his character completely, making him sympathetic even when his behavior borders on psychotic.  His is a brilliant, if malfunctioning mind, and Gyllenhaal's performance manages the neat trick of telling us that there is a decent human being struggling under the burden of his illness.  This basic decency leads him to decision at the end of the film that, while not very surprising, is nonetheless heroic in its own way.<br />The DVD is fairly good, with some interesting (if not particularly revealing) extras, and a couple of frustratingly disjointed commentary tracks.  In my opinion, actors and directors should strive to actually PREPARE what they are going to say, while still allowing for some spontaneity during the recording session.  If not, you get a lot of laughing and people talking over one another, as you do here.  It's good for a listen, but don't expect anything truly revealing.<br />I'm not sure how much further the Moebius film can be taken.  It may be exhausted with just a handful of striking examples.

0385510438|5.0|I bought this book on a Friday afternoon knowing I would be on an airplane and waiting on a connecting flight for several hours that evening.  By the time I reached Dallas I had read almost half the book!  I finished it in the early morning hours Saturday.  The book is so interesting and typical of Mississippi (and Louisiana) politics.  <BR>The Last Juror covers a ten year span in the life of a young man, just out of college....five years of college without a degree... who buys a small town newspaper with money borrowed from his grandmother.  Shortly after his purchase the most horrific murder of a young mother occurred.  This book is a  chronicle of how small southern towns really are.

B000006TRV|5.0|This is a truly great album, though by Pink Floyd standards, I consider it to be their third best (1. Dark Side of the Moon, 2. Wish You Were Here).  The reason I rate them ahead of the Wall is because they are musically more interesting.  However, what makes The Wall stand out is the lyrics, which take Wish You Were here, and to a certain degree, the Dark Side of the Moon to the back of a tool shed with a big wooden paddle.  <br />My first experiences with this album were when I was an infant, and I used to go to sleep listening to this music.  I loved it then, and I love it now.  The first song, In The Flesh?, starts of with subtlety, until you hear the resounding crash and the first power chord.  Then you hear track 2:  The Thin Ice, which is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The lyrics are deceptively dark, but the music is just divine.  Then we go on to the Another Brick in The Wall Part 1--&gt;The Happiest Days of our Lives--&gt;Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 sequence, which I think is mediocre compared to the rest of the album, though it's probably the most famous work Pink Floyd has done.  <br />Then we go on to Mother, which has the best lyrics in the album.  After hearing this song, it's easy to realize that Roger Waters, who wrote this album, was a little bit crazy.  <br />I probably have to cut short this review, for it would probably end up being too long if I kept going at this rate.  <br />My point is this:  Buy this album!  You will not be disappointed!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre before the nominations and was astonished at this post-modern gem of a story.  The simplicity of this film let the characters shine.  I do not usually  &quot;relate&quot; to films but I will admit this movie had me from scene one.  Bill Murray astounded me and he very much deserves the Oscar for this role. (making up for the supporting actor snub from the Royal Tenenbaums)  I am a little perplexed by the lack of recognition for Scarlett Johansson however.<br />      I love the fact that this movie is about the real, gritty and a lot of the times banal moments of people's lives.  If you watch this film with an open mind and dare I say heart it will leave you stinging. Not to worry the ending will kick you in the gut but in way that is reminiscent of Casablanca. Not a happy ending but in no way a sad ending. Do not misunderstand me however this movie is funny. Not always in a huge guffaw manor but will make you crack a quite a few smiles.  Just seeing Bill Murray sing &quot;More Than This&quot; by Roxy Music on karaoke is priceless. <br />      Oh... and the soundtrack... FABULOUS.  <BR>So if you didn't like this movie on the first viewing may I ask you rewatch it without the expectations you placed upon it. Its not an all out comedy nor is it an all out drama.  Everybody has that one story they never tell.  That one person you met somewhere, maybe at a bar, on the bus, in a different city or perhaps another country.  You may not even remember their name but for one hour or day or week they made your life a little more bearable.  Keep them in mind and then watch this film
0380820846|4.0|This is my second Julia Quinn book, and my obssession to her writing is growing immensely.  In this novel, she specifically writes as if you're watching a movie instead of reading a book.  The \\"movie description\\" is not meant for the plot but for the dialogues themselves.  Sometimes it's annoying and tiresome when writers explain everything, detail by detail, as if you're too stupid to figure things out for urself.  That's what I like about Quinn; she's not worried if her readers might misunderstand some context on her writings.  \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\\" is not the best in the series(I'm assuming for this is just my second quinn, as metioned b4) but it was fun to read.  When I read a second novel from the same author, I usually expect repetitions or patterns on the plots.  I was surprised and pleased that it is not so in Quinn's case.  In this novel, she writes about the kind of love that \\"starts with a smile, a word a teasing glance\\" instead of the \\"thunderbolt-from-the-sky\\" type on \\"An Offer from a Gentleman.\\"  I find myself engrossed on every chapters and (shockingly) on the emotional scenes(I used to have a neutral facade when trying to read those kind of scenes on romance novels because they're so predictable), but Quinn had changed that.  She also doesn't end the novel with a make-up chapter or a marriage.  Here, she poured a part of herself that is a writer.  Colin and Penelope had learned that each of them has a talent for writing.  It made me think of the author herself, as I read the part where they are discussing one's joy when he/she find the exact words for their feelings or descriptions for their surroundings.  Of course after good things, there's always a bad thing, even a small one.  To be fair and not be called  biased, I have to say that the story is a little bit slow in the beggining.  Some of the should-be-witty comments turned out not to be witty at all.  All in all, the strong points will definitely beat these weaknesses.  It should be obvious by now that I absolutely recommend this book to everybody.  Pls dont judge the cover by the cheap harlequin type picture on the 1st page.  I almost didnt read it bcoz of that.  I hope the publishers will give Ms. Quinn's talent a little bit more credit.  But I think, Quinn, being the writer, is a 100% aware of the cover so I might as well direct my plea to her.
B00014NE62|5.0|It was a bold move for James Ivory (A Room with a View, Howards End) to even consider making this infamously once-banned E.M. Forster novel as it was never going to be a huge commercial success due to the uncompromising subject matter. This is a rare masterpiece of queer cinema, it does not shy away from the intense passion and emotional turmoil between its principal male characters, and there really isn't much in the genre that can compare in terms of quality and depth of storytelling, except perhaps Marek Kanievska's equally brilliant [[ASIN:B0002ABUNY Another Country]] (1984).

B00005B36H|5.0|The date: November 19, 2002. I finally was getting into rock music, and Tool was one of the first bands that I wanted to explore. I had listened to stuff like Staind, Godsmack, Linkin Park, and even Nirvana, but nothing I had heard could prepare me for this. This album made me realize that music is a healing force, that music can transport anyone away from their world and their problems, and help them to see life in a new light. Truly, this album gave me a new perspective on life and art. Thanks, Tool.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This CD is definitley one of the hottest albums I've heard in a while, and will probably be the hottest of 2004. Kanye's lyrics are just as impressive as his producing ability....although he's still no Pharrell Williams or Chad Hugo. He definitley gives Timbaland some competition. As for the songs go, I enjoyed every track on the album, including the Bernie Mac skits. I reccomend this album to everyone.
B000060P79|1.0|In the vast ocean of repugnant pop rock bands featuring pre-pubescent singers, whining about non-existent love lives over music consisting usually of two or three power chords repeated ad nauseam, Simple Plan is the big ugly whale eating up all the program time on TRL and all the space on the Hot Topic shelves.<BR>  Honestly, words cannot describe the putrid garbage that is this album. Hell, it's not even original. It merely dumbs down (as if that were possible) the schlock of Green Day and Blink-182, aiming toward an even less intelligent and mature fan base. All of you &quot;punk rawkers,&quot; I hope, will eventually grow out of this phase, graduate from middle school, and listen to real music.
B00011RPB0|1.0|First, let me say I loved the movie of Lost in Translation.  Definitely a 5-star movie.  BUT, I HATED the shameless advertising on the DVD.  Much to my shock, after plunking down the money here to get the DVD, I put it in my machine and it automatically starts up with streams and streams of advertising for coming attractions,etc.  Hitting the Menu or Jump buttons doesn't work! They've disabled it in this portion of the DVD!  All you can do is do a forward scan... it still takes close to 10 minutes to get to the movie!!! Each time you play it! This is disgusting and shameless. No one wants to pay close to 20 bucks for a movie and have to sit through these mandatory commercials. I'll never buy a DVD from this producer again.
B000084T18|5.0|Are you people insane?! How can you say that this CD only has 2 good songs on it. I personally give this CD 5 stars. 50 Cent is not getting the attention he deserves. How was he not even nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy's? And how did Outkast beat him in &quot;Best Rap Album&quot;. This album is, by far, one of the best the rap industry has ever seen. I'm looking very forward to the end of 2004, when 50, eminem, and Dre will all be relasing their new albums. Shady Records is the best label by FAR!!!
6305081751|4.0|Even someone with a heart of stone will feel for the characters featured in this film, which is based on a true story.<br />Both Cher &amp; Eric Stoltz give moving performances, as a biker babe mother 'addicted' to drink and drugs, and a son, who can't get a girl, and is severely facially deformed.<br />I originally saw this movie quite a few years, and only remembered the scene where he's in high school, and he talks about being from Planet Vulcan.<br />Of course, the facial disease Rocky Dennis has is fatal, so obviously, you know what the ending will be. And the tears ended up tripping me - this is another film that I can add to my &quot;Films I Cry At&quot; list. My mum grabbed it, as she loves true stories, and it's not a film I will ever watch again - I hate crying at films!!! It's only a story is what I keep getting told, but it doesn't work. But you feel for the characters so much.<br />The real Rusty Dennis apparently was a consultant to the great Cher on this movie, and is now rumoured to be battling a drink &amp; drug addiction - and can you blame her? The Cher gave when she found Eric Stoltz had died in his sleep, was almost too realistic.<br />Cher gives a great performance in this movie. It's one of the very rare movies where she isn't wooden - although she does advertise her plastic surgeon a lot. This is a movie to watch purely for Cher, to see her before she overdone the plastic surgery, and is does a farewell tour every couple of years.<br />Eric Stoltz is unrecognisable in his role of Rocky. He must have had a very boring time sitting for so long in make-up!<br />A very moving film, and totally worth watching!
0385504209|5.0|.<br />Review:<br />Dan Brown does a phenomenal job in capturing the conspiracy theories of the Priori de Sion (see Holy Blood, Holy Grail) in a gripping whodunit!  Literally, you will not be able to put the book down because of its design, and its wonderfully enjoyable writing.<br />I found myself always trying to read just one more chapter, and finished the book in a few nights. Each chapter is short, fast paced, ends in a situation of suspense, are often based around curious riddles, and the overall conspiracy topic and its details are very interesting!  (Even though Baigents Messianic Legacy shows the Priori documents/claims listed in Holy Blood, Holy Grail are fraudulent!  But, thats an entirely different story.)<br />Browns mystery interestingly details the friction and conspiracy of mainstream Christianity (e.g. the Catholic Church) juxtaposed against the conspiracy of age old paganism.<br />This mystery takes us through some exotic locals like the Lourve, with its historical works of art and their interpretations; Rosilyn Chapel in Scotland, a Swiss Depository (a very foreign concept in the US), London and Parisian Cathedrals, and many other interesting places.  It also takes us to many other curious points of history and time, giving us needed perspective on who we are today, and how our societies got to this point.<br />Story:<br />A beloved Louvre Museum curator is violently murdered in the museum and is found with self imposed enigmatic clues to his death and murderer.  His secret grand daughter, a Parisian cryptographer, and an American academic symbolist search against time and danger to decode his messages which include riddles and anagrams of the works of Da Vinci, Hugo, Cocteau, Newton, Pope and the secret Prioi de Sion.<br />Negative:<br />Brown has designed the book to somewhat conclude that the above conspiracies are based on the fact of the truth of paganism, over the fiction of Christianity, rather than the opposite.  If there is so much truth and historical basis for the paganistic interpretation of Christ and Mary, why does it have to be so secret for 2,000 years - waiting for the right time to show itself to the yearning world?If there is so much truth and historical basis for the paganistic interpretation of Christ and Mary, why does it have to be so secret for 2,000 years - waiting for the right time to show itself to the yearning world?

B00003CXXP|5.0|Compared to most of the things we view on the wide screen this film appears as a visitation from another dimension.  The lighting, viewpoints, cutaways and music were near perfection. Many have discounted the story for a number of reasons which include violence, copying of other artists, dullness, etc. What I have heard in day to day conversations, though, is always the same thing:  The ending is the problem.  <br />No, it is not a smile-filled conclusion but it is a brilliant and poignant one, almost a wistful goodbye to the follies of mankind. In fact, given the scope of the plot and how it begins to move to an ethereal plane toward the last, it is a logical ending.  Spielberg pays homeage to many who have come before him (he has always given credit where credit is due) but he has reached a new apex with this work.  This is art in the truest sense of the word - stunning.

Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN&quot;, along with &quot;THE DA VINCI CODE&quot;.
B0000CDL3W|5.0|As good, if not better, than the two previous Terminator movies, in this action filled film, John Conner is yet alive and well, but we don't know for how long. He has kept his identity secret since the last terminators were destroyed, and he believes he has stopped Judgment Day. But can anyone really stop Judgment Day? This movie is a war - the machines against us, and it isn't pretty. This time the machines are stronger, better and more fierce than in the last two movies, and our hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger aka Terminator, must now fight not only to ensure the survival of John Conner and his soon to be wife (or so says Arnold) but he is now an obsolete version and the new machines have the power to terminate him. Machine against machine plays heavily in this film, and you will not lack for action and adventure. Truly fascinating special effects and riveting performances.

The movie is often comedic and over the top, but ultimately pulls at the heartstrings.  The identity switching gimmick isn't original of course, but it gives a great glimpse of how a little change in perspective helps us understand each other.  <br />Now my 8-year-old is an aspiring rock guitarist!
B0000CFW87|3.0|I had high hopes after hearing Josh's first CD, but this one just isn't as good.  Some of the tracks are just too &quot;pop&quot;.  I did enjoy &quot;My Confession&quot;, &quot;Broken Vow&quot;, and &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (though I wasn't crazy about the loud choir in that arrangement).  Other tracks, like &quot;Caruso&quot;, were just okay (Russell Watson does a better job with that song).<br />Don't get me wrong; this is a decent CD.  But I hope Josh's next one is more along the lines of his first, at least in the selection of songs.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say, but it's a fact. Listening to Are You Experienced?, The White Album, Led Zeppelin I, etc. will reveal an undeniable fact: every band has their inspiration, and some of them draw more heavily from that pool of resources than others.<BR>I've heard the gamut of complaints about the Strokes, and really most of it isn't thought through very well. It's the same kind of reactionary anti-hype complaint that we make about most talentless pop acts, which the Strokes certainly aren't (NO, they are not the same as Britney or Pink), and which many talented bands like the Beatles had to deal with in their time (NO, I'm not saying the Strokes equal the Beatles).<BR>First of all, the Strokes can't help if they're touted as the next big thing, the hype machine often runs with or without the consent of the band. <BR>Secondly, comparisons can always be made, but let's be real, find me one album that sounds exactly like Is This It? People that say the Strokes sound JUST like VU or Television are obviously not listening to the same albums that I am. <BR>Finally, the variety complaint: for me, this album is more of a concept than a collection of inidividual tracks. Each song blends into the next simply because you take the album as a whole. It creates an atmosphere that wouldn't exist if you injected the type of Radiohead or Bjork variety that everyone seems to pining for. <BR>In short, a great album. Love it or leave it. But please, stop the bitchin.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|Certain places attract the weird and wacky like moths to a flame. \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" (\\"The Spanish Apartment\\") seems to be one of those places, in a charming little comedy about a rather clueless French exchange student who finds out about life from his peculiar neighbors.<br />Xavier (Romain Duris) is a naive, uncertain young Frenchman with a promising future, even though he's still living with his hippie-dippy mother. He secretly longs to be a writer, but is buried up to his nose in the French bureaucracy. To get the job he wants in the European Commission, however, he has to spend a year in Spain. So he leaves his unhappy girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou), moves to Barcelona, and rapidly discovers that the people who live in the building are quite, quite loco.<br />The apartment building has a gaggle of strange people from all different countries, including Belgian lesbian Isabelle (C&eacute;cile De France) who teaches him how to seduce women, skills he soon uses on frustrated doctor's wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godreche). With a bunch of offbeat tenants from all over Europe, and his own problems back home, will Xavier figure out what he really wants?<br />Coming-of-age youths surrounded by loons aren't anything new; last year's \\"All I Want\\" has a similar theme. What sets \\"L'Auberge\\" apart is the sort of gleeful goofy irresponsibility of the characters. Okay, the theme of the movie is as thin as a Disney cartoon's (be true to yourself and discover your inner artist! In Barcelona!). There are no pretensions of grandeur or depth in this film; the Fawlty Towers homage is proof enough of that. You can see the ending coming a mile away, but it doesn't really matter. The ride is what matters.<br />The overal directing style of this movie can be summed up: \\"cute.\\" That's about all. The pitter-patter of feet as the characters fast-forward through the building is cute the first time, but doesn't really wear well.  The humor is cute (the seduction instruction is priceless), with plenty of fluffily goofy moments. And the camera lingers both on the gritty and picturesque parts of Barcelona, giving a good feel for what it might be like to live there.<br />The supporting characters tend to be rather stereotypical, such as the uptight Brit or the talkative Italian. I liked the weirdos anyway. Duris has a certain naive charm that makes Xavier seem even younger than he is, although sometimes he needs a slap on the... well, the butt. Tautou, unfortunately, is wasted in her small role, but is noteworthy even though she has little screen time.<br />\\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" is a charming, unrealistic, slightly goofy comedy film, a little like a multi-lingual sitcom.

This film follows the general precept of the book that mankind is in a war with a race of insect-like creatures that have various castes.  As with the book the movie does not attempt to resolve the war, but does intend on providing some hope.<br />Heinlein has been called the Dean of Science Fiction.  Because of his phenomenal success he was able to write beyond the boundaries of many of his contemporaries to express his viewpoints regarding society.  The novel on which this movie was based was laced with several political viewpoints as well as predicting the future of the military that we continue to see as the trend of our military today.<br />When Heinlein wrote this novel in 1959 he tried to convey the simple concept that citizenship in the most free society on earth was taken for granted, and he thought that perhaps one way of changing the definition of citizenship was to require that it be earned.  Thus Heinlein advocated that all citizens should give two years of public service.  Some people have narrowly construed this service to mean military service, but in his book Heinlein clearly stated that the service was governmental service and did not specify the type of service.  In any case, earning the right to vote was central to the book.  That concept was minimally discussed in the movie in favor or making an action-packed military monster movie.<br />Heinlein's future military was focused on the individual, with incredible weapons and training.  Interestingly, we see that today our military continues to rely on ever-better weaponry with the individual soldier wielding ever more power and hopefully having better training as time passes.  Again, the movie threw out this concept in order to make the movie move faster with multiple rescue scenarios.  While Heinlein's bugs were not sympathetic, by having the bugs callously destroy a chunk of Earth real estate and the sympathetic characters enables the audience to loathe them even more.<br />After throwing out two of Heinlein's key concepts, the result is a B science fiction movie with lots of gore and action.  However, even with the traditional science fiction themes, I liked this movie.  The acting is only fair, much of the movie is \\"golly gee whiz\\" and salute the flag, and the plot has more holes than cheesecloth, and for all that it is a fun and exciting movie that I've watched at least four or five times.  Some of the scenes are dramatic and scary, such as when the flying bugs attack, and when the ground bugs spear people.  The scenes with the tanker bugs are incredible, and I have spent too much time trying to figure out how their burning dissolving fluid works.<br />There are places in the movie that are likely implausible, and yet, maybe not.  When Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) pilots a huge spaceship out of dock she does it by eye and barely keeps from damaging the ship and the dock.  Clearly not standard operating procedure, and had the ship been damaged she would have been fried (or should have) by her boss.  However, she is cocky and overconfident and takes responsibility and authority, all traits that we try to cultivate in our military within the framework of standard military discipline.  So perhaps parts are a bit far-fetched, but maybe not too far-fetched.<br />One aspect that I think Heinlein would have approved is the brutality of military training.  People have broken bones, pain and suffering, just as they would in actual combat, though situations that cause death are clearly unacceptable.  While the scenes of injury in training are initially shocking, clearly medical technology has the capability of repairing such injuries, and being capable of handling the shock of seeing those injuries or withstanding them could give a soldier a combat advantage in the field; gruesome, but effective scenes.<br />The film was intended to be shocking, and it succeeds.  This movie is not for children.  I would not let anyone under the age of 14 watch this movie, even though there are a few video games with similar levels of violence.  However, I think the movie is too violent for even young teenagers, and it deserves its \\"R\\" rating.  There are a few scenes involving nudity and one involving sex that again may be shocking, but given the equality of men and women in this army of the future, the scenes make sense.<br />I've read the book and I still like the movie.  This movie is not going to win any awards, but who cares?  I think this is a great bowl of popcorn movie action film where you can relieve some stress as thousands of bugs are gruesomely terminated.  There are times when you really want to root for the human race, and this one allows you to do so without guilt.ie is not for children.

B00007BH5C|5.0|Call me crazy if you like but this soundtrack is far better than 'The Fellowship of the Ring' soundtrack. Howard Shore seemed to place a greater emphasis on this soundtrack between the two.<br />In fact, watching the movie after hearing the soundtrack over and over, I can see how the music definitely helps to make the second installment of these movies a better movie than the first. 'Two Towers' soundtrack has a larger sound and feel to it. It has a nice mixture of vocal and instrumental, some of which are mixed together (e.g. 'Foundations of Stone - which has a huge chorus sound). There are a lot of textures to the music, from large choruses and large orchestrated music, to simple slow moving features that allow the music to breathe, to marches and flowing strings.<br />I spend a lot of time tracking down soundtracks to play while I read and study. This one is one of my favorites. If you love soundtracks, and especially if you love a classical, large orchestrated sound to your soundtrack selection, then you will not want to be without this soundtrack. I highly recommend it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West has just ruined the careers of at least half of todays &quot;rappers&quot;. No more studio &quot;gangsta&quot; crap anymore and who cares how many hot cars on 23's yall have or how much ice you have, i could really care the heck less. Kanye West is real hip- hop and rap. This CD without a doubt will be remembered for years to come as the beginning of real hip-hop and the end to &quot;studio gansters&quot;. Kanye West has just ended the careers of at least half of todays so called &quot;rappers&quot;. Ladies and Gentlemen this is true hip-hop at its finest. To: Kanye West Thank you so much for giving the public the honor and pleasure to listen to your music. You music is the hottest out right now and will be until you decide otherwise. Thank you so much and now i am off to the store to buy another copy just to show my thanks to you. Heck i might by two more, lol.

B000056TKC|5.0|This is a fantastic recording of Beethoven's famous ninth symphony. It's the first stereo recording of the symphony, and still very few other recordings come up to its standard, if any.<br />The first movement is as it should be (and far too often isn't): lively, gradiose, but without pomposity, and in some way barbaric. The second movement, Molto vivace, really dances, and has a rythmic drives that carries it forward and takes you along. The slow movement is really played rather slowly (18 minutes), but it's the most beautiful rendition of it I have ever heard. Fricsay shapes the melody with real care for every little detail, and he manages to make it really sound like music from heaven. Then, after these 18 minutes of gorgeous serenity, the finale comes as a fresh breath of air. Sheer joy shines from this movement, in which Fricsay, unlike many other conductors, avoids being pompous. The soloists are all excellent and in top form, and they sing the music with real vigour and joy.<BR>The orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, is in as fine a form as ever, and the recorded sound is excellent. It sometimes, but very seldom, gets a bit muddy, especially in the first movement, but most of the time it is really sharp with a clarity comparable to that of any later recording. There is only one little problem: There is a lot of tape hiss in the background. But then again: The performance is so good that you have forgotten it after five minutes of listening.<br />So, finally: A wonderful performance of one of the greatest symphonies ever, far better than the famous Karajan recording, which I find rather cold (compared to this one, at least). I must admit, I haven't heard any recording by Furtwängler, but until that happens this will be my favourite recording of the ninth. A tragedy that Fricsay died so young. If he had lived longer, he would surely have been recognized as one of the greatest conductors of the twentieth century, comparable to Karajan, Bernstein and Toscanini.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I just got this CD and I waited on it since I saw &quot;Through the Wire&quot;.  I waited after the album was held off from Fall to November to December to Jsnurary to now.  I finally got it, along with T.I. and Pitch Black. Kanye was saved for last as the main attraction.  Well, I herd the first track (the first of a lotta skits\intros), then track 2:&quot;We Don't Care&quot;, which is a good track, as all of them are, but when you get past the skits, you gotta hit the core of this CD.  Kanye West is a killer MC with content, at least more than everybody else.  The best tracks on here are: Spaceship, The Workout Plan, Get Em High, and Through the Wire.  A lot of people would prolly disagree, but the rest of the tracks are just 3.5 to 4s, they good, but I just haven't listened to ll of em yet, but when I do, I'll post up a review of each track. &quot;til then cop this for yourself, if not for content and\or alot (not all) good beats, and some funny skits (if you smart enough), or for the two singles already released (not including All Falls Down) get it for the cover.  TI'm not gone say what's in it, but it's some exclusive stuff up in there.

B000001FG5|5.0|The Bee Gees were still the hottest music group in 1979 (hard to believe it's been 25 years!) the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack stayed at #1 for six (WOW!) months, they knew that the follow-up will be a &quot;pressure album&quot;.  This is quite similar to the situation The Eagles (&quot;Hotel California&quot; to &quot;The Long Run&quot;), Fleetwood Mac (&quot;Rumours&quot; to &quot;Tusk&quot;), and Michael Jackson &quot;Thriller&quot; to &quot;Bad&quot;) were having.<br />For the record, the Bee Gees had three #1 hits including &quot;Tragedy&quot;, the best song because of the beats and hooks.  Of course, only a handful of albums have had three #1 hits so &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; remains an essential album.  Also, I felt that &quot;Living Together&quot; should of been a single because it would have gone to #1 also in my opinion!  I like the melody and construction of the song.<br />Overall, I like this album and recommend it to all Bee Gees' fans.  However, &quot;Main Course&quot; is still their best album.
B00006HBUB|2.0|Let me get started that I never was and still am not a fan of the whole Scooby Doo franchise, even when I was younger so I kept my expectations relatively low but even then, this big screen adaptation completely comes crashing down to the ground in a lot of ways. <br /> The plot is decent enough, telling about the gang who has gone their separate ways but reunite after they all get an invitation to Spooky Island where they discover an amusement park but strange things happen and endanger all of them and they all have to work together to find out what's going on to the tourists. Too bad the bumbling acting and miscast actors and actresses just ruin it from here. <br /> What really kills this film in my opinion is the grossly miscast actors that played the characters. No offense against any of them but this glaringly shows that where they stand, they were completely unsuitable for their roles. The most glaring of all were the actor who played Norville `Shaggy' Rogers and especially Sarah Michelle Gellar who I feel really dropped the ball on this one. They all act completely out of character and hardly even act like real heroes at all. Instead they just look like they were all just going for some Jurassic Park style joyride through caverns and acting like fools. <br /> In many ways, this feels more like watching a bad episode of TRL (Total Request Live) on MTV) with the worst of behavior of the characters. The music from Suger Ray is not bad and it's kind of funny watching the band members chase around the characters but they make up the bulk of what's good about this movie and even then, even they could not save this movie. The other redeeming quality is the ending which I must say isn't all that bad either but then again it was great just because the movie was over and that I could finally go and see something else instead. These things prevent this movie from being a one star but just barely a two star. <br /> I really tried to like this movie but even when the brain is turned off, there's nothing that was on here that was enough to persuade me to ever see this movie again. It's this kind of stupidity and dumb acting that has turned me away from comedies and made me shift into much darker more dramatic movies as of recently. It's not the worst movie in the world by any means but this \\"Scooby Doo\\" movie just fails in so many ways that it wouldn't kill me if I were to never see it again nor it being taken out of print. There is nothing that a \\"Special Edition\\", Expanded Edition, or truckloads of extras could rescue this waste of film from the dumpster. <br /> A complete waste of film. I can't even believe that they are even making a sequel. This isn't the worst movie in the world by any stretch of the imagination but it wouldn't kill me if this were to vanish from existence. There are some redeeming qualities in this film but they are few and aren't enough to make this movie worthy of killing time. <br /> If you're in the mood to see something that isn't necessarily thought-provoking and want some brainless comedy, then I would suggest \\"Eight Legged Freaks\\" which I feel was much better. <br />Don't bother too much with the much hyped sequel in the works. For all we know, it will flop big time when it's released to theaters. On the other hand, with a more positive note, I hope they learned the mistakes made in this first \\"Scooby Doo\\" movie and try harder on the sequel but I have my doubts on that.

B0000AQVCL|3.0|I do like this CD for what it is..I too got suckered in by the iPod commerical and if the rest of the CD was closer to &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; I would like it a bit more. I love the whole sort of Stooges vibe you get with that track.<br />The rest of the CD is a tad too psychedelic rock for me, sort of like &quot;The Coral&quot;, only better, actually  more like Zeppelin and Steppenwolf mixed in a blender, a much more expensive blender than in  the 60's..but I digress. There are some fantastic tracks on  this  that are very old school formula rock, but the overwhelming swirling feeling I get from the rest of it make me feel like I took  the pill that makes me smaller..and I will see you on  the dark side of the moon...........know what I mean?

B00005JKWJ|5.0|&quot;Blade ll&quot; offers exactly what you would expect:  Lots of martial arts fighting, thin plotting and ghoulish vampires, but the surprise is in director Guillermo Del Toro exhilirating and stylish approach, which elevate the film above its somewhat far-fetched plot, even for a vampire movie.  Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the titular vampire hunter, and with just as much aching cool as he did the first time around.  Within the first ten minutes of the film, he saves his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from torture, and a new breed of vampire shows its face.  A Reaper.  A super-strong and almost indestructible foe that turns it vampire victims into new Reapers and this gang is led by a jolly good fellow Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).  Seeing Nomak as a threat, the Vampire Nation offers a truce to Blade for his help in hunting down and killing the super-vamps.  But of course, nothing for Blade is what it seems, especially with David S. Goyer's occasionally juvenile script.<br />But Snipes (who also co-produced the film) and Del Toro shine in this kind of movie.  Intense fight scenes comprise nearly half the film, involving swords, guns, bombs and plenty of fist-flying, giving fans of the first film what they really want:  Blade kicking much Vampire ass.  But the fights are sometimes marred by painfully obvious computer effects, and a couple painfully trashy shots.  But these are minor quips, seeing as Snipes is so freakin' cool as the big bad Daywalker, and Del Toro stages the battles with intense, macabre applomb.  If your in the mood for escapist fare with plenty of bloody violence, &quot;Blade ll&quot; fits the bill nicely.  The DVD includes a making of, details on the Vampire make-up and interviews with Del Toro, Snipes and David S. Goyer.
B0000039LE|5.0|I saw this movie when I was little and it was very scary. Not Gory to be gory(John Carpenter doesn't do that in this movie)It is a suspensful thriller that not only keeps you scared but for some reason interested. The Station wagon that Michael Meyers follows Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends around is just spooky and creepy by itself. The empty house plays a part in this as well. Donald Pleasance in probably his best performance to date is great as the doctor on the trail of this troubled man who becomes a killer and goes and terrorizes the town of Haddonfield but only a few people know it when he shows up. The rest would be oblivious to what is going to happen in their little town.<br />Directed by John Carpenter<br />Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance and Nick Castle
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown, a writer of many great thrillers has recently published The DaVinci Code.  At first, when I saw The DaVinci Code and read its summary, I thought I would be ready for it because after all, Angels and Demons, which is another book by Dan Brown, is extremely gruesome.  However, even reading Angels and Demons did not prepare myself for this.  Although The DaVinci Code is not as gory as Angels and Demons, the psychological views it gives on Christianity is still rather shocking.<br /> In The DaVinci Code, there were many things that I learned about which I had never heard before.  For example, Dan Brown talks about the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei, which are real ancient societies with different, but strong beliefs.  Reading The DaVinci Code has taught me more about history and ancient &iexcl;§gangs&iexcl;¨.  Not only is it an extremely intriguing book, it is also a great learning experience.  The DaVinci Code is also a great book on the debate in Christianity.  The &iexcl;§evidence&iexcl;¨ that Dan Brown says against Christianity is so strong that at times, I found myself believing what Dan Brown was saying.  In addition, Brown also brings a new light to the rarely discussed side of Christianity, which is rather interesting because as a reader, we can read about Brown&iexcl;¦s opinions on Christianity.  However, for devout Christians, The DaVinci Code may be a bit derogative to the Christian religion.  As a result, even though this book by Brown is enlightening, it may not be appropriate for everyone to read.<br /> Out of all the latest books I&iexcl;¦ve read, I must admit that Dan Brown&iexcl;¦s The DaVinci Code is the most interesting and illuminating book.  Not only does its reader learn about history of the world and of Christianity, it is also a fascinating suspense novel which keeps its readers on the tips of their toes all the way throughout the book.  In conclusion, I believe that Brown&iexcl;¦s The DaVinci Code is without a doubt a book worth reading and not only does its readers gain knowledge through the book, they also gain new insight on different beliefs.the book, they also gain new insight on different beliefs.

This mystery is teeming with suspense, thrills, and surprises.<br />The story begins with the rendezvous of ten strangers on Indian Island, a private island off the coast of Devon, England. An unknown host or hostess has invited the guests there for the weekend. However, the host never appears; instead, the sinful past of each guest is unwillingly revealed. One by one the sinners are punished for misdeeds from their dark past. Suddenly, the livings are amidst the dead and the guests are murdered in the same manner that the Indian boys die in the Nursery rhyme. Another element in the story that makes the hair raises on your neck is that there is ten Indian figures on a table in the main lobby. As each guest dies, one figure disappears...<br />Agatha Christie manipulates the personalities of the characters well. She depicts their fear and sense of desperation through her clever usage of words. As the only ten people on the isolated Indian Island die one after another, Christie shows the helplessness and desperation of the survivors and she beautifully grasps the human emotions of the characters well.<br />Another interesting technique of writing used by Agatha Christie is that she portrays the guests like normal people who have amiable and caring personalities. The readers will definitely a connection to them and even begin to like them. However, when the awful crimes of these seemingly innocent individuals are revealed, the readers will face a conundrum &iexcl;V whether to fear for the lives of the characters or to fear them.<br />This mystery also deals with the theme of justice and law, and how if ending the lives of the guilty out side the law are justified.<br />Each of the guests on the island are found not guilty by the courts for crimes they had committed. The murderer, by killing these ten individuals, seems to seek justice where the courts had failed. Through this dilemma, Christie forces the readers to ponder whether seeking justice outside the law is morally acceptable, especially for cases in which the courts have failed.e the law are justified.  <br />Each of the guests on the island are found not guilty by the courts for crimes they had committed.

6305364613|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie when I was a senior in high school.  I didn't understand it at all and, furthermore, thought that it was silly and juvenile.  However, after developing a love for the performing arts and actually reading shakespeare, I have developed an appreciation for this movie that is hard to explain to the casual viewer.<BR>  I believe that Baz Luhrman's take on this is brilliant!  Mercutio steals the show, but is only highlighted by his introduction and death scene (which is the pivotal point of the story).  Teenage angst and true love that no grown-up can remember experiencing rules the roost here.  Guns are brilliantly substituted for swords and daggers, and the word-play is only enhanced by the film's use of the cast's modern nuances.  I find myself watching this every couple of months and loving it!<BR>  As for the director's use of Shakespeare's dialogue, I belive it is nothing short of genius.  To blend the modern with the elizabethan is a difficult task, and luhrman does it with a grace that shows confidence and true emotion, which resonates in shakespeare like a great bell being rung through all our time.

B000069KGM|5.0|On the inside liner notes to the Chicago's second album, the band writes, \\"With this album, we dedicate ourselves, our futures and our energies to the people of the revolution ... And the revolution in all its forms.\\" (I think the band changed its name because the real Chicago Transit Authority, which actually operated trains and busses, didn't want their name attached to such a radical band!) From there on out, Chicago slowly drifted into assaulting us with lighter pop music. Such is life!<br />But Chicago I (actually \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\") and Chicago II (actually named just \\"Chicago\\") are both rock masterpieces, blending rock and horn driven jazz into a perfect union. <br />CTA contains several \\"hits\\" including \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\", \\"Beginnings,\\" and \\"I'm a Man.\\"  But, except for Free Form Guitar, which is mostly guitar feedback, the album contains nothing but masterpieces.  Unlike the jazzy soft rock ballads which dominate Chicago's later work, \\"CTA\\" is a pure rock album.  From the opening cords of \\"Introduction,\\" through the last cords of \\"Liberation,\\" this album is pure rock with a dominating base line, somewhat distorted guitar, some really great drum work, with the horns being used for ambience like a synthesizer or for punctuation.<br />Chicago (the second album) and Chicago V made it to DVD-Audio.  I only hope they release this one as well.  Although Amazon does not list this as an essential album, it certainly deserves it.

068983571X|4.0|Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle is a great and easy read for anyone who likes mystery books. This book is another case of death or murder investigated and solved by Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson. The book begins and ends in London in Sherlock Holmes office, but the rest of the book mostly takes place in Devonshire at Baskerville Hall. It is a race to solve the mystery of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville before its too late and before the same thing happens to Sir Henry Baskerville, Sir Charles nephew who is the next to take over Baskerville Hall.<br /> In the first few chapters, the author catches your attention by explaining The Curse of the Baskervilles and why it is believed that every member of the Baskerville family has died the same way and by the same curse. The curse is well explained and it makes you wonder if it could be true or false. As the book goes on and Holmes and Watson are getting closer and closer to solving the mystery, there are a few unexpected encounters and events that are also unexplained. These events make it a bit more difficult to figure out the mystery, but they keep your attention and make you want to read on and find out what might happen next.<br /> Not all the characters are what they seem to be, which allows for a few surprises along the way of solving the mystery. New events and people come up in every chapter making you want to learn more and solve the mystery. Holmes and Watson are a great team and although people try to get in their way, they always stay right on track until the end.<br /> Hound of the Baskervilles is an awesome mystery book in my opinion. I liked everything about it, especially that it always kept my attention with the new and unexpected twists. Its easy to understand and not too long of a book either. The characters are well explained in their roles throughout the book so youre never confused about whos who. The author puts some twists in the novel to try to shy you away from the real murderer, but they dont stop Holmes and Watson from figuring it out. As the book goes on, it gets better and better as you get closer to solving the mystery. Youll have to read the book to find out what The Curse of the Baskervilles is and what really happened to Sir Charles Baskerville. I strongly recommend reading this book, even if youre not into mystery books I think youll enjoy it.shy you away from the real murderer, but they dont stop Holmes and Watson from figuring it out.

B000000W5N|5.0|The Stones were at their peak when &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was recorded in 1970.  It's strange how the Stones were hitting their stride at the time when The Beatles were disintegrating.<br />&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is arguably their best album.  It builds on the strengths of &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; by featuring the amazing lead guitar work of Mick Taylor the finest lead guitarist the band ever had.  &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was his first full-length album as a band member.  This album showcases his talents well.  &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; being a single album, is more focused than &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;  It packs a powerful punch, cut for cut.  <br />Every member of the Stones shines on this recording.  Mick sings with grit and power.  Charlie swings harder than ever.  Bill keeps a full, inspired bottom.  And Keith literally kicks ass with every riff.  Chuck Berry is never far from his fingers.  The opening of &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; has got to be the raunchiest, sleaziest riff ever recorded!<br />Between 1968 and 1972 the Stones did not record a dud.  &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; is the crown jewel of the best period in their career!

The incognito assassin moves swiftly into the building and kills the Supreme Judge and leaves undetected by any of the FBIs forces thats planted there as protection.  Not long after, the assassin strikes again and kills a second Supreme Court Judge in a Gay porn movie theater by strangling him to death, once again leaving no traces.  The White House has no specific suspect and the investigation comes to a halt until a brief writer by a student comes along.   <BR> In the mean time, Darby Shaw is just living her life as a normal college student.  Studying law, she is naturally attracted to the politics that are going on in the government, so it wasnt long before she heard about the murdering of the two Supreme Court judges.  Driven by pure curiosity she took a long duration of time to write out a brief that pin points possible suspect that would have benefited the most with these two judges dead.  She shows her brief to her professor/ lover, Thomas Callahan who passes it to many other politicians that are investigating the very case.  She has no clue of what devastation this action was about to inflict to her life.  <BR> Gray Grantham a reporter that worked for Washington post, also tires to single handedly figure out who is behind the murders of the Supreme Court Judges.  He one day gets a phone call from a man that claims to be, Garcia saying he has some information about the case.  Yet, he soon loses this lead and finds himself cornered into a dead end until one day Darby Shaw calls him and informs him about some details in the brief she wrote.  Soon after they both meet up in Washington to have a little talk.  Shortly both of them decide to work as a team to try and solve the mystery, and their first step was to find this mystery man called, Garcia. <BR> The Pelican Brief is an interesting book that I would recommend highly to other readers that enjoy a good twist in plots and realistically built characters. The story is very much plausible and everything is well explained down to the very last detail.  I plan on reading more books by John Grisham, and I believe that all his books will have his own unique type of humor that I enjoyed so very much.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I have been a Beatles fan for 40 years and have tried to buy and hear and see everything Beatles for all those years.  I have just seen the Anthology and can't understand why it is that I have never seen 90% of what is on this compilation.  I am astounded.  It's like getting Beatles all over again.  I have even more respect for them than ever.
B00004X10B|5.0|This bag is GREAT. I use it toghter with a tamrac backpack. But i prefere this one. It's nice and big. and easy to adjust to your needs.<BR>I use this bag when i travel by plane as my handluggage. It fits my basic travel camera gear and some other stuff like a book and a bottle of water.<BR>The strap is good and doesn't hurt.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I agree that the editorial review is totally off base. Linkin Park is basically the best band I've ever heard and Chester and Mike are completely original and it's crazy to compare them to Limp Bizkit. As for their tracks being bad, have you listened to the CD? The band is amazing! I reccomend this CD to anyone!!!!!
B00018D44U|3.0|Norah Jones has a distinct vocal quality unfortunately this album does little to showcase it.  The only work I found truly compelling was the first track, &quot;Sunrise&quot;.  Her Duet with Parton, &quot;Creepin in&quot;, was energetic and was different from the rest of the album.  I took to &quot;Toes&quot; even though it was only slightly better than any of the other mediocre tracks.  Overall this album didn't showcase her voice as well as &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.  Except for the three tracks I mentioned above it's really great background dinner music.  Otherwise it's unremarkable.  Thankfully I got it cheap from Best Buy.
B000002KB8|5.0|Believe it or not even a place like India where bhangra prevails Black Sabbath still manages to have to have faithful followers. This was the first album i ever got and i went crazy over it.

Nope they din't. They're a great band as well but SABBATH are the reason for them being in Metalmania, REALLY! And if METALLICA dint exist then LINKIN PARK ( WHO I DESPISE FOR THEIR GEEK METAL ) wuldn't exist either.<BR>     So lets just STAND UP AND SHOUT SABBATH LIVES FOREVER AND EVER! and buy this album cos it rulz<BR>Heres my very own rhyme on Sabbath's impact<BR>-The world just got darker<BR> The fire lost its sparker<BR> Walpurgis and the witches<BR> Headbang and leave your riches<BR> Buy this album and hear the best<BR> And put your ears to their test <BR> Sabbath are the metal GODS<BR> They beat all the odds<BR> Rising from Birmingham<BR> To singing for Buckingham<BR> Sabbath lives forever<BR> Never say die<BR> Cos its a LIE!<br /> All you will hear
0375507507|2.0|A topic which held such promise was a bitter disappointment.  The story struggled along, largely because it was very difficult to follow her chronology or lack thereof.  So much was left out regarding the war and social struggle of the time in an effort to spotlight her family, that it left me wanting to know more about the country and times in order to understand what her family was going through.  Fuller bounces around from one time in her life to another without any consistency.  Overall, this book was just very boring and there was nothing to grab onto as a reader.
0393317552|3.0|This author attempts to explain the economic success of societies as being due to certain natural advantages. However, &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; analyses the relation between national IQ scores and measures of economic performance. In one analysis of 81 countries for which direct evidence on national IQs is available, mean national IQ correlates 0.71 with per capita Gross National Product (GNP) for 1998, and 0.76 with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1998. Other analyses consistently demonstrate national IQs predict both long term (1820-1922) and short term (1950-90; 1976-1998) economic growth rates measured variously by per capita GNP and GDP (mean rs ~ 0.60). Regression analyses of the 81 countries, and then of 185 countries, including 104 whose national IQs are estimated by averaging those from adjoining countries, shows the national differences in wealth are explained first, by the intelligence levels of the populations; second, by whether the countries have market or socialist economies; and finally, by unique circumstances such as, in the case of Qatar, by the possession of valuable natural resources like oil.<br />&quot;IQ And The Wealth of Nations&quot; has a lucid, expository style. Chapter 1 reviews the various theories advanced over the last 250 years to explain why some countries are rich while others are poor. These include climate theories (temperate zones are said to be best), geographic theories (an East-West Axis is said to be best), modernization theories (urbanization and division of labor are said to be good), dependency theories (exploitation and peripheralization of poor nations are said to be bad), neoliberal theories (market economies are said to be good), and psychological theories (cultural values like thriftiness, the Protestant Ethic, and motivation for achievement are said to be good). While some of these theories almost certainly account for some of the disparities between countries, IQ scores turn out to be the single best predictor.
6304779607|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 80s saw this film, you had no choice.  I remember seeing it at the drive-in on a double bill with Road House.  This is a fun Cannon/Stallone collaboration.  Yeah, it's oozing with cheese and cliched as can be, but it wouldn't be half as fun if it weren't.  Stallone's in tough guy mode again(it seems like he never set off to be an action hero, but ended up one), this time around as a Dirty Harry-esque cop, who's naturally hated by the force and considered a &quot;loose cannon&quot;.  He's out to stop a wacky death cult and protect their next victim at the same time.  Not to mention romancing her.  The cult's motivations are never totally explained, they just go around slaughtering women.  Brian Thompson is scary looking and menacing as the cult leader with that cool knife we all remember.  We get a big showdown at the end where Stallone really gets into Stallone mode.  He takes on the whole cult(who REALLY must want to kill this woman considering they all come out of hiding to get her) Rambo style.  I must say that Cobra is one sadistic mother-most of the cult members he likes to set on fire in various ways!  Try watching it again and relive the cheesy fun.  If you haven't seen it(shame on you), you must, must, must!!
B000002JS8|5.0|this album took a little time to work on me,now i love it!!!!as one of my favorites you wont get too much better than this!awesome songs,great lyrics,bons vocals are wonderful,mal and angus guitars sound and perform great(as always) cliffs bass and phils drumming fit together perfectly!more than half of the songs are still concert staples.this is to bon what back in black is to brian johnson.
0385504209|5.0|I am amazed at how many people feel they need to write an essay when the review books.  I absolutely loved this book!  It is exciting and suspenseful.  Yes it does stretch the imagination to buy into the description of the Holy Grail but so what?  I am a strong Catholic and I think Dan did a great job of expanding my mind.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22: the only thing that can define a book that seethes with paradox, contradiction, and twisted reasoning. The novel is set in the closing months of the Second World War, on a little island off the coast of Italy. Heller skillfully depicts a generation of people who are used against their will and the sheer helplessness of their resistance to the system. What makes this piece of literature so clever is how Heller uses his characters, which seem so real, to create many instances of contradiction and questionable logic. For example, Major Major, who will only see people in his office he himself is not in it. Or Commanding Officers who care more about well shot aerial photographs of bomb targets than actually bombing the target. And the most twisted contradiction of all: the main character's (Yossarian) iron will to survive the war, or die trying.<BR>The novel stays fresh by unfolding many side stories that involve Yossarian's relationship with other characters. This, of course, tells the reader more about the men in the Bomber Division, but it also reveals more about Yossarian himself and his attempts to get himself out of as many missions as possible. Other characters present many of the recurring themes in the novel, such as faith. The division's chaplain, Chaplain Tappman, spends all his time preaching from the Good Book in hospitals and to the men, but at the same time, doubts everything he says, and the Lord's existence. Also, Yossarian's superior officers reveal the absolute weakness of language: while it offers no reassurance to those facing death, or those who could meet it, it offers the power of officers to trap their men in a hopeless prison of the army or in a grander scheme of things, bureaucracy. <BR>By the time I finished this book, I was again presented with another contradiction: while this book is serious, sad, and incredibly thought-provoking, it's quite the funny read.
B000067CPX|5.0|Put quite simply, one of the best albums of the last few years. Those with a basic understanding of what music is will realize that the RHCP evolved and matured dramatically since their beginings 20 years ago. If &quot;Californication&quot; was their official induction to Music (with capital &quot;M&quot;), &quot;By The Way&quot; is not only proof that it wasn't a fluke, but rather another leap forward.<BR>Definitely in my list of magic albums.
B00013F38K|1.0|I think this series is really offensive to Chinese people. It's a throw back to the days when they painted white people's faces with black polish. Only this was the 70's where that kind of blatant discrimination was thought to be over. Can people not see that David Carradine is NOT Chinese, even with their attempt at covering him with makeup to make him look like one?<br />I'd say, boycott those who seek to profit from blatant discrimination.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, I really wasn't feeling Kanye that much as an emcee, but I always loved his soulful beats though. For one I hated, this guy's delivery. And this is only because I'm judging him only off of his 2 singles.&quot;Thru the Wire&quot; (which is a great song dealing with a life experience) and the mediocre &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; ( I don't care if everyone else thinks different) I just hate Slow Jamz. So I kept saying to myself there's no way in hizzell I'm buying The College Dropout. And you know how bad rap fans are these days they'll jump on any bandwagon just because it's a new trend. And besides that, most of these &quot;so called&quot; hip hop fans have suspect judgment when judging quality product. Hence, a majority of almost every album on Amazon, has a 5 star rating....when the album is actually garbage.<BR>I took some advice from a reliable source to buy College Dropout. And man, was I wrong about this cat being mediocre. His 2 singles don't give him any justice. Kanye literally brings hip hop back to the mid 90's, when people still looked fly and remained humble. When the underground was appreciated by the upper-ground, when lyrics had substance and originality, when every one wasn't carbon-copy or one dimensional. This album is honest, sincere, comical, arrogant, uplifting, and at times humble. What more could you want out of an album. You can honestly listen to a large majority of this album without jamming your finger on the skip button. The standout tracks here are &quot;We Don't Care&quot;, The soulful, struggle-felt &quot;Spaceship&quot;, &quot;Get em High&quot;, featuring Common Sense and not Common, and My personal favorite &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; where Kanye introspectively explains maintaining his love for the Lord during those times of struggle and times where he wasn't completely faithful to the church. He also confronts the biggest war within Black America....The war amongst ourselves. One of Kanye's best verses on this album is on &quot;Never Let me Down&quot; Feat. Jay-Z, where he starts off by saying  &quot;Now ni%#%s can't make it to ballots to chose leadership, But we can make it to Jacobs or to the dealership&quot;. Dude, that's something that the youth needs to hear... the only negative contradiction to Kanye's verse on this song is that Jay-Z's unusual tired delivery, and flossy innuendos do not match Kanye's level of upliftment and consciousness. There's a lot of skits but I can't lie, they had me cracking up. And sometimes Kanye's self congratulatory/self centered arrogance may be a bit annoying but it's all understandable considering what this man had to go thru to make it. I know it's hard to take the word of most of these Amazon reviews, I'm sure Vanilla Ice and MC Brains have a 5 star review on here somewhere. But take it from a real hip hop head. The College Dropout is worth the cheese. This is not a typical Roc Family album. Definitely the best of 2004 thus far. <BR>Get inspired.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I got this thing for christmas, and yes the only good movies are &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;.  Here's what makes this DVD collection amazing: 2 versions of every movie, each movie has another accompanying disc LOADED with extras that will keep fans entertained FOREVER.  You have director's commentaries, you have deleted/alternate scenes, you have different mixes, different languages, subtitles, the backstory behind every single movie, the list goes on and on forever.  Plus, on the 9th bonus disc, the coolest thing is seeing a guy's collection of movie props, and I mean these are like props every fan wishes they could have.  I can't go on forever about how fans of the Alien saga should buy this set (Amazon won't allow it) but you really really need to see it to believe it.  This is a purchase you will not regret, trust me.  I will write reviews of the movies separately on each movie for sale, not here.  Here, I am just pining on and on about how the entire set is worth the price, even if it has only two good movies in it.  Buy this and enjoy the world of the Alien saga.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Kids, Adults, everyone everywhere! Harry Potter was an amazing movie! The Book was absolutely amazing, and the movie was a brilliant adaption!It is about an orphan named Harry Potter, who unknowingly ruined a horrible and powerful wizard named Voldemort as a baby. He was celebrated and known all over the wizarding world! Harry's only living relatives were his aunt and uncle who were muggles (non-wizrds) and Harry is forced to live with them, though they hate him for being a wizard. Harry knows nothing of being a wizard until a messanger from the wizarding world shows up at Harry's doorstep and tells him he was accpeted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is faced with problems when he comes to Hogwarts. Harry and his two best friends, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger find out that a teacher is trying to steal something that may bring Voldemort back to life! It is up to them to find out who, when no teacher or the head of The Gryffindors (a class)believes them, and the only person who would listen is the man who isn't there: the Headmaster Dumbledore.<br />Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) plays his part quite well, and has brang an image of Harry Potter to life. The roles of Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) were so fantastically played! I felt as if I personally knew them by the end of the movie! They were convincing and displayed their roles with enthusiasm. Maggie Smith played the head of the Gryffindor house, and Alan Rickman who played Head of the Slytherin house, were great! They are amazing actors in an amazing movie! The movie would not be the same without their performance! Richard Harris, played Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He was perfectly suited for the role! After reading all the books, i had a clear image of what Dumbledore would look like, and Richard Harris could have convinced me he was the real Dumbledore! Unfortunately, he passed away during the summer and the third film forwards will be played by a different actor, butRichard Harris will live on in our hearts.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Ah, the disaster that is &quot;Alien 3.&quot;  For the entire back story on the horrors this movie went through, rent this and watch the special features disc because it is a fascinating story.  But I'm here to judge the finished product, so...here goes.  This seems like a movie with no identity.  That is what it feels like to me, I don't know about anyone else.  Parts of it are a horror movie, parts of it are a straight gore-fest, parts of it are action, parts are sci-fi, and parts are drama.  It doesn't even seem like &quot;Alien 3&quot; was a good idea to me.  It's a very very hard movie to embrace, and I still haven't.  For the life of me, I can't get over how many times the &quot;F&quot; word is used in really ridiculous fashion.  One of these days I'm gonna go in and count how many times it is used as opposed to the other 3 films.  It's hard for me to write a review for this movie because there were so many things I just didn't like about it.  It does create an atmosphere of dreary colors (lots of brown tones, including the alien) and the setting is very depressing and is one you really feel uncomfortable in, which is a good thing.  What this movie lacks is characters.  No character really comes out and makes an emotional impact on you.  Well, one does but...nevermind.  Anyway, besides him, no one outside of Ripley makes an impact on the audience.  It's a bunch of bald guys with accents running from an alien, that's basically the plot once the alien is born.  I would not reccommend this as a purchase, but as a rental I would definitely reccommend it because watch the movie, then watch the special features and see what the movie was supposed to be and just see how incredibly hard Fox made it on everyone to make this movie.  1 star for the movie, 4 stars for the DVD.
1410102033|5.0|Adolf Hitler was probably one of the most successful leaders in History, and I'm talking about before the war. Before the war, he managed to bring back an economically desolate Germany and instill a sense of nationalism in ALL GERMANS (yes, even jewish germans). In fact, he completed such a huge feat that he was Time Magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.<br />But this book shows what we all came to realize later. Though he was a genius politician and an excellent leader, Hitler had his issues. Emotional issues and mental issues warped him brutally. Read this book to understand the war. And I think Hitler is evil. I'm not defending him in the above paragraph.  But you have to realize that he was a wonderful leader for a period of time. Then he crossed that line and spiralled into madness.<br />This book will help you understand that madness.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I can almost recite this film word-for-word I've seen it that much.  I can pick out almost every visual flaw on cue and...yeah I'm a nerd when it comes to this movie.  I'm not a James Cameron freak either who thinks everything he does is genius (&quot;Titanic,&quot; come on people) and I'm not a super-fan of either sci fi or the Alien saga.  This movie is just a great movie.  It has great acting, great plot, great character development, great suspense, and great action.  The film visually looks spectacular, it's shot very close to the action and is very emotionally gripping.  Another thing I like about &quot;Aliens&quot; is one of James Cameron's rules about sequels: &quot;It shouldn't require you to have seen the first film.&quot;  You can enjoy &quot;Aliens&quot; without having seen &quot;Alien,&quot; and I think that is very important.  While fans of sci-fi and horror will love &quot;Alien,&quot; fans of sci-fi and action will love &quot;Aliens.&quot;  I can't say enough about this movie, Sigourney Weaver is great, Carrie Henn as Newt unbelievably believable, Michael Biehn is great as Hicks, and Paul Reiser works his performance beautifully.  Bill Paxton is just Bill Paxton, you can't expect more or less from him.  There's no reason for you to have not ordered this movie by now, it is as much a classic as &quot;Alien&quot; and, in my personal opinion, better than &quot;Alien.&quot;  Buy this movie.  Now.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about buying this album at first.  I'm used to listening to the &quot;gangsta rap&quot; of today, so a dude on a spiritual tip is almost a complete 180.  Plus that other producer, Pharell, can't rap at all.  But when I listened to the first song (We Don't Care), I was pulled into a new world.  A world where tru hip hop reigned over the thuggish, iced out rhymes of today.  This is Kanye's World.  Most people think Mr. West is arrogant for no reason,  but he has the right to be big headed.  Dude produced the most soulful bumping beats I have heard in a long time, and he ripped over everyone of them.  On &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;,  his verse devours Jay Z's(which isn't really hard in my opinion).  My personal favorite is &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;.  Here Kanye breaks down how much we need Jesus in our day to day.  In one line, Kanye spits, &quot;They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus&quot;.  I agree because no one wants the positive.  That is why artists like 50 cent are so popular.<BR>         To anyone think about copping this cd, get it!!!!  Don't copy it either.  If its one cd you should pay the price for, this is it.  KANYE IS THE TRUTH. KANYE IS THE REAL.  GO GET IT!!!!
B00003E43V|3.0|This rates as probably the best recorded Elvis concert ever, and yet, once again it's not given the respect it deserves. First of all, it's not a regular RCA release. But more noticeably, the whole concert is not on this album.<br />I've never heard a reason why RCA has not released all the songs from this concert, which include All Shook Up, Polk Salad Annie and Suspicious Minds among others (Steamroller Blues from this concert was put out on a compilation a few years ago). Sure, all of these songs are available elsewhere, but this Memphis concert has an energy that other released Elvis concerts don't (with the possible exception of An Afternoon in the Garden). I mean, let's face it, Aloha from Hawaii is pretty much a low-key affair. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz.<br />Nobody really buys these albums but hardcore Elvis fans anyway, so why not give us something in RCA quality that we don't have - Elvis at home after 14 years. Make it a 30 year celebration package, 1974 to 2004, or something like that, you know, with lots of pictures and a review. At the very least, let  us know why the full concert has never been released, after all, RCA made a big deal about that lame song from Roustabout being on the Second to None package. Whooo hooo... not!
0345457684|5.0|This book was great; one of the better books I've read in a while.  The pace was quick, and the story started off with a bang.  I don't think there were any slow moving parts, for me.<br />Other people have mentioned the violence and sex.  They didn't bother me at all.  The violence added to the excitement of the story.<br />I can't wait to read Morgan's next novel!
B00005JMGL|5.0|There is only one word to describe this movie. Amazing!  This is coming from a person who HATES when classic movies are remade, and I absolutely loved it.  It was extremely, extremely close to J.M Barrie's book (My favorite childhood story) and is even closer then the Disney version made many years ago.<BR>  <BR>I have to admit that when I first saw the preview, I really didn't want to see it.  It wasn't until my mom dragged me to the theater after Christmas to see a family film that I realized just how good it was.  I particularly love Jeremy Sumpter(Peter Pan)and it's not just because I am like any other normal 14-year-old girl.  I thought that he portrayed Peter excellently!  He is just like how I pictured Peter to always look and he acts exactly like Peter Pan would act.<BR>          I also liked Jason Isaacs(Captain Hook).  I saw him in Harry Potter and it took me a while to realize who he was.  Anyway, he was really great and he made teh perfect Captain Hook.  Rachel Hurd-wood (Wendy) was also amazing, especially since this was her first film!!<BR>         All in all, this is a great film and I suggest everyone should see it.  It's great for all age groups, and I even saw it with my grandma after I saw it with my parents.  This story was my favorite book growing up as I have already said.I  saw the Disney movie probably about 3 times a week, and I think this version was even better!  I hope I have persuaded you to go and see it, because it is an excellent family film with adventure, a little bit of romance, and I know you will find it throughly entertaining!
0375704027|5.0|What a book.<br />This is Murakami's love ballad, a story that builds to a moving climax. There is so much life here.<br />Whereas 'a wild sheep chase' is bebop and 'a wind up bird chronicle' is free jazz, this book is a sad lovers ballad - with human frailty and sex and delusion and futility and ultimately affirmation and resolution.<br />One of the best novels I've ever read - comparable to Milan Kundera's 'the unbearable lightness of being,' only with Murakami's unique stamp.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West...we've all heard the name...we all know about his production skills.  What we didn't know about him was his rhyming skills.  Kanye West has really came up in that respect, juxtaposing his clever and witty lyrics with introspection and reflection.  His beats are works of art that never get tiring and you tend to discover new things about the beats each time you listen.  His flow is different from a normal mc and is unique.  With a little honing of the style, I think Kanye could be the next great rapper mentioned in the likes of Pac, Biggie, Pun, Jay-Z, Ice Cube and Snoop as well as others.  With lyrics like \\"can't complain about what the accident did to my left eye, Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye\\" on Never Let Me Down.  He seems unfazed by Jay-Z being on the track, churning out a classic verse with ease and outshining Jay on the track.  On 'All Falls Down\\" (IMO the best song on the album) he says \\"Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis\\" and the best verse on the album<BR> <BR>\\"We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom<BR>We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em<BR>Things we buy to cover up what's inside<BR>Cause they make us hate ourselves and love they wealth<BR>That's why shortys hollering \\"where the ballas' at?\\"<BR>Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack<BR>And a white man get paid off of all of that<BR>But I ain't even gon act holier than thou<BR>Cause bump it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou<BR>Before I had a house and I'd do it again<BR>Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz<BR>I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific<BR>I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific<BR>I got a problem with spending money before I get it<BR>We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it\\"<br />Syleena Johnson gets busy on the Lauryn Hill sample and the beat is Godly.  Of course 'Through The Wire' is a classic song as well as the Twista and Jamie Foxx collaboration Slow Jams, which is slightly lengthened on this album.  He's even managed to poke fun at gold diggas on The New Workout Plan but at the same time be smart and witty enough to show how stupid those type of women can be.  This song is about relationships and how some men wanna just hit and that's it and how women fall for it but they shouldn't.  He gets deep on Family Business and Jesus Walks - both excellent songs with lush production.  Last Call is a reflective track about his rise in the industry and how no one would give him a chance and how everyone criticized him.  <br />Kanye is sharp and amusing with his lyrics and shows a certain cunning and confidence that few rappers possess.  His beats are the best the industry has to offer at the moment.  He has crafted a near masterpiece with this album and any person hesitant to buy this album, hesitate no more.  Kanye is the Truth.  This is hip hop music at its finest.  College Dropout is a must have now & forever.  5 stars.
0385504209|4.0|Not being typically inclined to read murder mysteries, I was hesitant to read this book and ultimately lured in by its surrounding controversy and the 46 weeks it's been on the bestseller list. I must say, overall, I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued by the originality and suspense of the novel.<br /> I enjoyed the short cliffhanger chapters because they left a sense of suspense at every turn and seamlessly invited the reader to further become immersed in all aspects of the plot. I did feel that sometimes the turn of events in the story were predictable and (dare I say) clich&eacute;, but the fascinating symbolism and cryptic messages more than made up for any minor flaws in plot.<br /> The character development of both Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu had depth and sincerity, though the love interest sub-plot between the two was trite and unbearably inevitable. I did enjoy the subtle development and insight into Bezu Fache, who not only serves as the catalyst for the action, but also arouses suspicion<br />leaving the reader with an uneasy sense of distrust and ambiguity toward the character. He is a modern day Javert from Les Miserables, which is all the more fascinating to think about considering Victor Hugo is mentioned as, at one time, being a predominant member of The Priory of Sion.<br />As for the controversy, it seemed to me that the book made efforts to acknowledge the true and profound meaning of faith while bluntly acknowledging, as any historian will agree to, that the history we learn in school may be slightly askew from the truth. Look at how Columbus Day has turned from a celebration of discovery to an awkward day for elementary school teachers and a great weekend to buy a car!<br />In short, the novel is nothing to get your rosary beads in a knot over and I say that not in a heathenish way, but instead as an educated and devout Christian myself, unscathed by adversity and already aware of my \\"goddess\\" status.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This will be a classic.<BR>I like Ben Stiller.  He always does silly movies (think, Something About Mary) but he is original and deeper than people give him credit for (Reality Bites, for example).<BR>Let's see, Zoolander is about a vain, stupid male-model who realizes that there is more to being really, really, really good-looking.  When he notices his career beginning to go downhill, and then when his male-model buddies die in an explosion accident (a very funny scene, actually, featuring Wham's &quot;Wake Me up Before you Go-go&quot; and orange mocha frappucinos), he retires and decides to dedicate his career to the Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can't Read Good.  Coincidentally, Mugatu, the one designer who has not hired Zoolander wishes to feature him in his newest line of clothing, Derelicte, as well as brainwash him into assassinating the new Malaysian prime minister who has outlawed child labor...  Okay, while the plot isn't everything this film features a lot of memorable scenes (the Zoolander vs. Hansel walk-off, featuring Michael Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot;).  Acting is overexaggerated and goofy but I think it is appropriate for this satire.  Satire, but it is not too preachy, as in, &quot;Models are so superficial, everyone's beautiful on the inside.&quot;  The point's clear so Stiller does not try to drive it in.  Rather, he focuses more on the silliness and fun in this movie.  And, by the way, the soundtrack's great, too.<BR>Watch/buy this light-hearted film.  It is well worth it!
B004KWVDWI|4.0|Franklin J. Schaffner felt that the obligation of motion pictures is to entertain, it's as basic as that, and that is exactly what Papillon does. It is also a movie that really triggers your emotions from start to finish. I feel this is one of Steve McQueen's best acting roles. It was probably the most physically demanding and emotionally challenging role of his career. Dustin Hoffman is simply magnificent as Louis Dega, a role that demonstrates how versatile the actor really can be. It eventually earned him a best supporting actor nomination. Unfortunately, McQueen was overlooked by the Academy that year. Another example of their stupidity!!<br /><br />The film is emotionally draining, but I find myself watching this film time and time again because of its portrayal of one man's quest to gain his freedom no matter what it takes. Freedom always comes at a price. It is not something that is handed to us or exists freely. It must be earned and that is exactly what his character does by the time the credits role on this film. The viewer will not believe what the character of Papillon had to endure to gain his freedom. The trials he goes through are unforgettable and often left me wondering if I would persevere if I had to undergo the trials he faced.<br /><br />For me, Steve McQueen is one of those actors who really has a great on screen presence. I will almost always watch a movie just because he appears in it, good or bad. Papillon is no exception. Although Papillon is a character driven film, the movie must be viewed for more than just the characters. It also has wonderful cinematography, direction and a memorable, and at times haunting, musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It is right up there with the best of the prison escape films.<br /><br />Henri Charrire, the real life Papillon and author of the novel, talked about society and his real life experiences in this way:<br /><br />\\"Society does not want free men. They talk freedom, democracy, anything you want, but they do not want free men. Society wants conditioned men, men who march in step.\\" It's up to the viewer to agree or disagree with that statement while viewing the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend you watch this film today!hey do not want free men. Society wants conditioned men, men who march in step.\\" It's up to the viewer to agree or disagree with that statement while viewing the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend you watch this film today!
B0000028P8|5.0|This album is about 12 years old but it still shows how Mariah can really throw it out live and in living color. At the time, 1992 to be exact (I was just staring kindergarten! Yikes!) Mariah was a fresh new artist on the rise and was thought of as a *Whitney Wannabe* when this album was released, but she was soon to have Whitney pulling teeth in later years to come.  Without all the light shows, shirt ripping and hyper-active dancers, MTV Unplugged series offers sort of a \\"raw\\" approach to the top tunes of artists and does it deliver with Mariah cranking out tunes from her debut and \\"Emotions\\". <BR>To start up with a churchy twist to #1 hit, \\"Emotions\\" then delving into the Carole King penned, \\"If It's Over\\" with horns blaring it the back (making it sound *gasp* better than the album version!) then onto the jazzy turn for another #1, \\"Someday\\", you can actully feel the \\"live-ness\\" of the show and Mariah giving her all. \\"Vision Of Love\\" is up next, with a softer mellow approach. Followed by an upbeat, piano jamming romp of \\"Make It Happen\\" with Mariah just wailing. Snagging yet another #1 single, the Jackson 5 tune, \\"I'll Be There\\", off this album, Mariah was destined to become a bondifide songtress with this powerful rendition. To close a rather short but sweet album, sultry \\"Can't Let Go\\" which has a lighter and Latin beat to it. Not dissapointed at all with this album. I think it could've been longer, maybe added in \\"Love Takes Time\\" or \\"All In Your Mind\\"  but still it proves that Mariah can do more than sing a couple of high notes and shake her butt, she can put on a great show that will be remembered.
B000001OAA|5.0|\\"Garbage\\" is a debut album of great strength, it's a band announcing itself with the best material it has to offer, going for broke but never disappointing. What makes their music so enjoyable is the feeling of so much being mixed around. Consider that their songs can sound like a hybrid of The Doors, The Beatles, 90's U2, Patti Smith and Blondie...all at the same time. \\"Supervixen\\" is a rousing opener, a metallic invocation to \\"make a whole new religion\\" and singer Shirley Manson daring us to make her our obsession. \\"Queer\\" is a seductive piece that sounds like Nancy Sinatra meets Jim Morrison while \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" is a wonderfully catchy, memorable and dark in-your-face jam that would make Patti Smith proud. The band's drummer, Butch Vig, was Nirvana's producer on \\"Nevermind,\\" yet with Garbage there are barely any traces of this being a grunge retread (indeed, the sound is a little more accessible than Grunge, by all accounts a dead genre). The band shines precisely because of their talent, the guitars are examples of wonderful sonic experimentation much like what U2's The Edge was doing through the 90's. Shirley Manson is a great singer who knows how to express moods, her voice is not limited and it is surprising how many ranges she can reach through-out the album. The album has it's moments of gothic flourishes and techno polishes. Since this album announced them to the world Garbage has found success with their later albums (\\"Beautiful Garbage\\" being their most experimental outing to date), but \\"Garbage\\" is their baby, the album that showed us there was more to Girl Power and modern rock than the Spice Girls and Bush.
B00003CXWV|3.0|This movie went straight to video here, and although has an interesting storyline, the film jumps too quickly between periods to really pull you in.  Johnny Depp was excellent, as was Rachel Griffith.  Johnny Depp plays a real life cocaine dealer who eventually gets what he deserves. <br />A movie that overall is quite boring to watch.  Rent it.
0316666343|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  The character development is fabulous and the story line is gripping.  Besides enjoying the book, it also made me think of personal safety for me and my daughter -- something we all, unfortunately, should probably focus on a bit more.  High, high praise and recommendation!!
0385504209|5.0|Rarely does a book come out with so much attention and is able to live up to it. Dan Brown lives up to the hype. This book is amazing. I can't wait to read his other books.
B00005JMCN|5.0|One of the best films we have watched in a long time. Seabiscuit is a Classic and will be treasured over and over again.
B000000W5F|5.0|We thought they lost it. What is it? The Flar, the talent, the emotion, and we thought they lost it because they made a bad disco album or two. Who were we kidding? The Rolling Stones  came out with one of the best albums of their carear after putting out two of their worst.<br />Tattoo You starts off with one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time. 'Start Me Up' is one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever recorded. Then when kick into the mega hit 'Hang Fire' I always thought they were saying hang five, but who cares its a great song with some great guitar work from Keith and Ronnie. 'Slave' is alright but nothing to get real excited about. 'Little T &amp; A' my favorite song on Tattoo You, its sung by Keith and its got some of his best guitar work of his whole carear! 'Black Limousine' Ronnie Wood takes over and the same can be said about this as 'Little T &amp; A'  'Neighbors' is kinda punky for The Stones but thats alright its still a good song. The rest of the album gets kinda weak but its not bad its just nothing else stands out until the classic 'Waiting On A Friend' which is one of The Rolling Stones' best songs, great lyrics and just an overall great song, I dont know why it wasnt a bigger hit.<br />Overall Tattoo You is one of The Rolling Stones' best album, I would put this up there with Some Girls an Let IT Bleed. Dont Miss out!
B000060P79|4.0|I don't own the album (yet), but I have heard 4 of their songs so far. Here's my review of them:<br />&quot;Addicted&quot;- 5/5. It's the first song of theirs I ever heard.<br />&quot;I'd Do Anything&quot;- 5/5. Nice song, but overplayed.<br />&quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot;- 5/5. Great song, and I can relate to it... especially when he says, &quot;What the f*** is wrong with me?&quot;<br />&quot;Perfect&quot;- 5/5. I like this one as well, because I can also relate to it.<br />The rest of the songs I haven't heard yet.. and that's why I only gave the album a 4.
B000002KHH|5.0|Paranoid, the dawn of Heavy Metal. A Classic album by one of the greatest bands of all time Black Sabbath. I've said it before Black Sabbath have the greatest rythm section in all of rock and roll, and Pranoid shows it perfectly. Tony Iommi's guitar playing is the best that it was Tonys hole carear. Ozzys voice sounds great, and like I said Geezer and Bill's ryhtm is tight as ever.<br />Paranoid starts of with Black Sabbaths all time best song, 'War Pigs' the lyrics are Black Sabbaths best, the guitar solo is Iommi's best and if you didnt beleave me about Black Sabbath having the best rythm you will after you hear this! 'Planet Caravan' and 'Hand Of Doom' are among Black Sabbaths heavist songs on the album. 'Rat Salad' is the best instrumental Black Sabbath ever recorded. 'Elecric Funeral' is a killer song about acid rain, who knew Black Sabbath was concernd about the world? 'Fairies Wear Boots' is one of the best songs on the album and classic Sabbath. 'Iron Man' is one of Black Sabbath's biggest hits and one of Tony Iommis best performances ever. Then we have the tittle track, the reason everyone under the sun buys this album, the band is perfect on this song and the guitar riff is one of Tonys best. Ozzy is perfect and so are Gezzer and Bill. And 'Paranoid' was suppost to be filler, who knew?<br />This is Black Sabbaths most poular album and for good reason, its one of the greatest albums of all time! This along with Sabbath Bloody Sabath are two of the greatest albums of all time, you wount be let down, this I can assure you!
B000089RVX|5.0|dont even begin to compare evanesence and Linkin Park. in my opinion, they are nothing alike. Linkin park is more hip hop oriented with more turntables/beats. Evanescence is more musically oriented with amy lee singing some of the best melodies ive ever heard. i mean sure, they do have their simularities, but they are totally different. so you people are saying that they copied off of linkin park can go jusp off of a cliff. there is no comparison.
B000002UA9|3.0|Please, Please Me, the start to Beatlemania, I love The Beatles but sometimes I wish The Rolling Stones would have got here first. This was The Beatles first album, it was alright but it sure wasnt a classic.<br />Please, Please Me is filled with a lot of cover songs and also a lot of filler. There are seven songs on this album that are actualy good and the rest like I said are well, ther just filler!<br />'I Saw Her Standing There' and 'Twist And Shout' are the two best songs on the album and they are both rock staples and Beatles standards. 'Love Me Do' being the biggest hit of the album and the only number one.Other standouts include the title track, 'P.S. I Love You' 'Do You Want To Know A Secret' and 'Theres A Place.' The rest of the songs are all filler and no killer.<br />This isnt a bad Beatles album but isnt exactly a great one either, besides 'Twist and Shout' nothing really stands out, and thats a cover song so its not saying a whole lot!
0142000663|2.0|In Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", readers are introduced to the Joad family in their miserable living conditions in Oklahoma and their dreams of a new and better life in California. All thirteen Joads pack up in one old truck and begin their journey on Highway 66 to California along with thousands of other families looking for any work.  Their trip take them through the loss of five of their passengers for various reasons, bullying from cops, threats of starvation and no money, and even the death of their dog.  Yet, there is some sunshine as they meet up with another family halfway through who become their travel mates for a while.  As the Joads enter California, they eventually find refuge at a government camp for migrant families looking for work.  However, their luck is minimal as they know they can't stay and continue on, looking for better work and wages.  This brings them to their last stop in the novel which isn't any better than the last few.  Steinbeck leaves the readers almost wishing they hadn't even read the book, because there is no solitude for either the Joads or the readers.<br />I gave this novel two stars, because it did not appeal to me.  The story itself was depressing; it starts out sad, gets worse, and ends even more sad than it started.  The bad plot doesn't make the novel any better, either.  The book is literally just about a family riding in a car, looking for work.  Another big factor was the writing style.  I don't know if this novel is an example of all of Steinback's writing, but only half the novel was actually about the Joad family.  The chapters alternated between the Joad family story and a story about migrants in general.  This approach wasn't appealing.  I found the book to have a very slow start, and once it started moving along, the chapters about the migrants just seemed to be in the way, prolonging the story for nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you're a fan of Steinbeck.
0385510438|4.0|I am a Grisholm fan but have been disappointed and almost quite reading his works.  This book, along with Bleachers and A Painted House have brought me back.<br />This story is a 'one off' It is about the law - not from a lawyers point of view but a newpaper editor.  I like how the story moved and the details were revealed.<br />He developed good characters-Callie was my favorite and I wish I knew someone who cooks the way he wrote it.
B00005JMFR|1.0|This movie was absolutly horrible. The first was good, second ok, and the third just plain sucked. This trilogy could have gone up against the greats if they had stuck to the consistancy of the first movie. I think the thing that really killed this series was the awful acting of Reanu Reeves my god can he show any emotions at all. His horrible acting drove me crazy. Every line he had was said in the same monotone voice and i just wanted it all to end.  Thanks alot you *#@!er keanu, you ruined everything.
0767803434|3.0|This film is so over the top it's hilarious, this is POTUS as super hero, you almost wonder why he needs the plane I'm assuming the only reason he didn't reveal his true identity of US PRESIDENT MAN the masked avenger is that he couldn't find a convenient phone booth to change into his star spangled leotard. I enjoyed the film, but I feel a little dash of realism would have made it much better, just a bit believable maybe.
B000000OUE|5.0|This is definetely the premier White Zombie album (unfortunately the last, too) and nothing will ever beat this. Not even Mr. Zombie's solo work. I mean, La Sexorcisto was great but will never match to the unrelenting power and energy of this album. From dark, brooding rhythms in the opening track entitled Electric Head pt. 1 to the funky beats of Electric Head pt.2, the dark techno beats juicing Real Solution #9. The pumped up power of Super-Charger Heaven and the classic More Human Than Human will surely grab you. A perfect ending with the apocalyptic sound of Blood, Milk and Sky. And as a surprise, there's a secret instrumental at the end of the track itself. <BR>At 11:18, thats one hell of a track.<br />Be sure to grab this one! Its White Zombie to the max! One of the heaviest albums ever made.<br />\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"<BR>\\"I'm already dead....\\"
0783231202|5.0|AMISTAD tells the story of 1839 events involving a shipload of slaves who, having freed themselves from their captors aboard the cruel slaver La Amistad, try to sail back home.  Instead they are tricked into sailing north and are captured in New England. The trial that resulted began in insignificance but escalated until it drew in some of the most powerful individuals of the time, especially former President John Quincy Adams.<br />The fact-based thriller transcends itself in Spielberg's epic.  Yes, the story is one of heroism on the part of men trying to secure their freedom.  But the real importance of AMISTAD is its gritty, nauseating portrayal of slavery and of those who fought it and of those who espoused it.  It tells of how many of the ridiculous politicians of the time continued to bury their heads in the sand rather than take the hard steps that would require America and Americans to live up to the creeds and beliefs that had made them what they were.<br />Djimon Honsou (GLADIATOR) is wonderful in his portrayal of Cinque, the reluctant leader of the band of Africans. Matthew McConaughey portrays Lawyer Roger Sherman Baldwin, Morgan Freeman is Mr. Joadson and Anthony Hopkins is absolutely striking in the role of John Quincy Adams.  John Williams provides one of his most soaring and original soundtracks ever.<br />THE HORSEMAN
0062502182|5.0|Its hard to justify a 5 star rating for book whose plot and philosophies are inherantly cliche, yet is compiled and thought up so brilliantly that the authors message isnt trivialised. The alchemist did just that. Ive read books, poetry, and even saw motivational seminars intent on uplifting the soul. None of them did quite what the alchemist did for me. Paolo Coehlo incorporated elements of disunity; sadness and loss, to strengthen the underlying message. It teaches you not to hold on too dearly to things in life; that by ascending the hindrances of posession, you can achieve the truly great goals in life. At the end of the novel, you feel almost that the whole world will help you, when you want to achieve something. Its messages are terse, yet can be interpreted in many ways. <br />The author did for me what years of religion couldnt. Or rather, he articulated the most important aspects of many religions, in a refined and multi layered spiritual doctrine. The alchemist provides the soul food that in the 21st century seems scant.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Stay away from this one.  If you have to watch any of it just watch the special effects employed to reenact the Japanese attack.<br />Other than that, what you have here is a pathetic movie, a chick flick, that degrades one of the most serious and tragic events in our history.  It deserves far more than a big-screen soap opera that is an insult to the memory of those who died at Pearl Harbor.<br />Add to that the fact that the producers, in order to pocket the largest profits possible, made a \\"Japanese-friendly\\" version for release in Japan and you have one of the most irresponsible movies ever made.  Such irresponsibility by movie makers to soften what was nothing more than an unprovoked, cowardly attack on the part of the Japanese is criminal.<br />THE HORSEMAN
B00000294R|5.0|i think that this LP is a street classic.After all these years there are still no rappers who simply can write rhymes as well as he once did.R.I.P.What really strikes me about this album is not only the ill beats that he has but also what he actually depicts and the way he puts words together is absolutely stunning.And if you like that kind of music you should check out 2pac,biggie,wu-tang and immortal technique.All those rappers revolutionised the industry.Definetly worth buying.
B00018D44U|4.0|Anyone who listens to this anticipated recording by Norah Jones and pays little attention to the pivotal song, &quot;Humble Me, Lord,&quot; will NOT understand the nature of this collection.  Norah is quietly exposing an enormous world of hurt and loneliness and, more important, quiet humility before her muse.  She's genuinely swept away with this mellowness and humility.  Her voice is saying, &quot;This is just what you get, take it or leave it, and thanks anyway.&quot;  That's exactly why Dolly is a participant here (on &quot;Creepin' In&quot;).  And that is why one inspiration for these strange, mellow, languourous songs must be one phase of Bob Dylan (whether Norah knows it or not).  There is surely no hard rain fallin' here.  Hey, Norah's rain is exceedingly soft; it's satin and silk.  This sound is our strange America in a distant, brave new millenium.  This is a dubious and worrisome &quot;Sunrise&quot; that, alas, very much &quot;feels like home.&quot;  I really dread the next recording from Norah.
6305313687|3.0|After seeing this film I was amazed I had never heard anyone speak of it. This film is powerfully moving watching one mans struggle to save his brother from the fate he is inflicted on him himself. <BR>Norton is amazing in this film and earned a well deserved Oscar nomination as he is so believeable as Derek Vinyard. To watch the final scene where Derek realises it is to late to save brother Danny brought tears to my eyes.<BR>The film in general is amazing how the past is portrayed in black and white and the present in colour. <BR>The scenes when Derek is retelling his time in prison are very touching and to watch a man realise all he has known is a lie is very moving indeed.<BR>I love this film and now after watching it tell everyone I know what a great film it actually is.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I was expecting a comedy and found a tragedy instead.<br />Lost in Translation is a haunting drama displaying the emptiness and rootlessness of western culture; especially westernized Japanese culture. With stark character portrayals of an aging American actor and a young American wife, their out-of-place feelings for Japan mirror the same feeling of their domestic lives.<br />I found the show tedious, flat, and empty.
B00000JNNY|4.0|My goodness. Etta is a goddess! Her voice sounds like an angel straight from heaven. Although Etta's voice is raw and powerful, it has a beauty to it that is completely unique to her. Not to mention, how can you forget the classic songs on this album, like &quot;At Last&quot; and &quot;Sunday Kind of Love&quot;. You must check out this album. Etta's voice is like no other!
B00018D44U|4.0|I didn't read any reviews of the new CD until after I'd listened to it a half dozen times, but I knew, like Jones herself did, that she was taking a risk.  She'll alienate or disappoint some jazz fans and many of the pop music listeners that fueled \\"Come Away With Me\\"'s success.  Jazz fans like their mellow, sexy, chanteuses with unique voices and plenty of musician-type chops...they were prepared to have Diana Krall move over and make plenty of room for Miss Norah.  Now they won't be so sure....it's country (country???)to them.<br />Gutsy, larger than life women singers, who are musicians and arrangers first, don't have to worry about chart-topping or where they might cross over. Check out a couple of kindred spirits to Norah, who have crossed over between genres MANY times, and still carved legends for themselves:  Linda Rondstadt and Bonnie Raitt! So maybe, when Norah tells us she \\"Feels Like Home\\" - it means she'll do more CD's in a quasi-country style, even if it costs her some record sales in the pop and jazz arenas.<br />After telling you how much I enjoy the CD, and, with some perspective on individual cuts below, you wonder, why is this not a 5 star album?  The reason is a little more complex than the country/jazz mix.  It has to do with the quality of the songwriting.  And it's not about Jones, and it's not about her covers.  Her own songs and her covers are every bit as great on this CD as they were on her last.  Instead, it's about an acoustic guitarist/songwriter named Jesse Harris.<br />Featured as a songwriter or sharing credits with Jones on 5 songs on \\"Come Away With Me\\", Harris sits in on only two numbers in the new CD, and contributes no songs.  He's displaced by lesser talent (but great bass player) Lee Alexander.  I wasn't really partial to Alexander's songs on the first CD (\\"Lonestar\\", \\"Seven Years\\" and \\"Painter Song\\"), although his \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\" was a favorite.  On this CD, he contributes or writes 6 songs, and they are \\"the weakest links\\".<br />Harris, on \\"CAWM\\", by contrast, wrote the smoky, middle-East tinged \\"I've Got to See You Again\\", which blew me away with amazing lyrics, violin, and a star performance by Jones.  He also excelled with four other songs, including the big hit \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"One Flight Down\\".  Not having him here raises questions in my mind about whether he was comfortable with the direction the CD was taking, and I hope Norah brings him back for the next CD.  Or, maybe he was just too busy....having released \\"The Secret Sun\\" in 2003 with his band, the Fernandinos, Harris is releasing a new album, \\"While the Music Lasts\\" later this year.  Harris may not make it as a performer, but as a songwriter, he is without par.<br />To test my theory, that the songs are weaker on this CD, I queued up \\"CAWM\\", and decided it was a Mercedes compared to \\"Feels Like Homes\\" American luxury car.  Because Jones can produce perfection, her newest CD, which will arguably be better than some I'll give 5 stars to in 2004, pales by comparison....against her prior standard, this CD is \\"only\\" superb.<br />Best Songs:<br />\\"What Am I To You?\\" - Norah sings the blues on her own composition.  It's a Sam-Cooke style blues tune.  A Hammond organ lays down the beat with standing bass and drums, and Tony Scherr (also a member of Harris & the Fernandinos) gives a memorable guest performance with electrifying electric guitar riffs - he's got a great touch.  This song is pure Jones and is my favorite cut - tune, lyric and a gutsy girl blues voice could make this a crossover hit on several charts.<br />\\"In the Morning\\" rocks like a Bonnie Raitt song; it's by Adam Levy,  and, like \\"What Am I To You?\\", Jones plays the Wurlitzer electric piano and blends, blends, blends vocals with talented backup singer Daru Oda.  There are country themes here, too - a good woman is deep into a man she's unsure of.  So deep that, both these songs conjure up a bedroom scene in some future films, if the directors are wise.<br />Although the genre of the CD is debatable through the first 5 songs, when Norah kicks in with Townes Van Zandt's \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" (from Texas Troubadour)  you know its country.  Electric guitars back up the slow two-step tune, and Norah has a credible Texas saloon tune under her belt.<br />\\"Don't Miss You at All\\" - Norah pulls out of the country and flat back in to a jazz standard, when she wrote these words for Duke Ellington's \\"Melancholia\\", and uses the song to close her album.  Like \\"The Nearness of You\\" on album #1, she shuts it down with just the distinctive voice, and the piano.  No one else is necessary....maybe this will be her signature mark on upcoming CD's as well - this particular choice is gorgeous, with Norah's lyrics evoking the sadness of the melody:<br />  \\"And then I wonder who I am<br />  Without the warm touch of your hand<br />  As I sit and watch the snow<br />  Fallin' down\\"....<br />\\"Humble Me\\" - it's a beautiful ballad; part folk, part gospel, with only a vocal pump organ, the unique resonator guitar in Kevin  capable hands, and a stand up bass.  It's a quiet interlude, particularly when you are still recovering from \\"Creepin' In\\" .... a footstomper, it belongs more on a Dolly Parton album, with Norah sitting in.  Enuff said.<br />Look for some CMT hits and some new fans for Norah with this CD!s are wise.<br />Although the genre of the CD is debatable through the first 5 songs, when Norah kicks in with Townes Van Zandt's \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" (from Texas Troubadour)  you know its country.  Electric guitars back up the slow two-step tune, and Norah has a credible Texas saloon tune under her belt.  <br />\\"Don't Miss You at All\\" - Norah pulls out of the country and flat back in to a jazz standard, when she wrote these words for Duke Ellington's \\"Melancholia\\", and uses the song to close her album.  Like \\"The Nearness of You\\" on album #1, she shuts it down with just the distinctive voice, and the piano.  No one else is necessary....maybe this will be her signature mark on upcoming CD's as well - this particular choice is gorgeous, with Norah's lyrics evoking the sadness of the melody:<br />        \\"And then I wonder who I am<BR>          Without the warm touch of your hand<BR>          As I sit and watch the snow<BR>          Fallin' down\\"....<br />\\"Humble Me\\" - it's a beautiful ballad; part folk, part gospel, with only a vocal pump organ, the unique resonator guitar in Kevin      capable hands, and a stand up bass.  It's a quiet interlude, particularly when you are still recovering from \\"Creepin' In\\" .... a footstomper, it belongs more on a Dolly Parton album, with Norah sitting in.  Enuff said.<br />Look for some CMT hits and some new fans for Norah with this CD!
6305280762|4.0|This is an epic film, a true Hollywood Classic with plenty of star power to go around, though the fire is the real star of the film.<br />However, Fox has duplicated some masters off some old copies to give us fairly good picture quality and sound but something I wish they had done is to restore the hatchet job that the film got when it was released on television.<br />An example:  I remember watching this movie when it first came out in 1974.  I saw it in the theater.  In the sequence where Jennifer Jones and the two children are outside the banquet room where their entrance is being blocked by hardened cement around the door....(who left that there so conveniently????), they are waiting for help.  To pass the time Jones plays making 'finger figures' with their shadows on the wall.  I remember this so well because she diverted the children's attention from the predicament they were in.  That part of the scene has been abruptly edited and hasn't been shown since the television showing.  There are more cuts which I won't mention here.<br />As for the acting McQueen and Newman have powerful onscreen chemistry with one another.  Richard Chamberlain makes a dastardly villain who is responsible for the tragedy.  William Holden is a classic actor who has a very annoying character.  Another annoying character is Faye Dunaway's whose acting job reminds me of a love-sick calf....the way she looks at Paul Newman in the final scene is enough to make one puke!!  She was merely there for decoration, anyway, and in my opinion it should have been she that fell out of the scenic elevator, not Jennifer Jones, who has the biggest female part in the entire film.  Jones and Astaire bring class to the proceedings and Jones should have won an oscar nomination along with Astaire.  Hers is the character that is most vividly remembered in this movie and one longs to see them reunited at the end but he winds up with her cat instead!!<br />The rest of the cast is adequate.  O.J. Simpson proves he's just as bad an actor as he is a liar.<br />The special effects will disappoint no one and the film will keep you in suspense all the way.  Truly a classic film, but FOX should really have gone all out and included the dubbing of languages, a running commentary with fans of the film (which there are millions since the surviving stars probably wouldn't have been interested), and of course, the restoration of the deleted scenes.<br />Still a great movie which I give 5 stars to and more!!  I give only 4 stars to the DVD which is cheaply made.on proves he's just as bad an actor as he is a liar.  <br />The special effects will disappoint no one and the film will keep you in suspense all the way.

B00005JLXE|4.0|I agree with the three and a half star rating Daredevil is getting. It's not an awful movie like some say, but not quite five star material which is okay by me. They tried too hard to put WAAAY too much from the comics into one movie, but Ive seen movies where they left far too much out and I applaud the makers of Daredevil for trying to put as much into it as they could. It's never boring! I guess the playground scene would also have to be cut to make this a slightly better movie, but as unrealistic as it is I still like the playful mating dance between Elektra and Matt Murdock/Daredevil in that scene. The movie soundtrack is great. Bullseye and Kingpin are a little different, but no less cool than in the comic. All the pieces don't fit quite right, but the director and writer deserves credit for giving it his best shot. I've watched Daredevil more than once and it's a good action movie and the DVD is filled with groovy extras so it's a worthy purchase.

I mean, what else is new?<br />I was prepared for a sweet, bright, pretty Diance Keaton. She's a sweetheart, right?<br />I wasn't prepared for the flat-out laugh-out-loud humor, irony, and wit of this charming comedy! Just so much fun...my wife and I were still chuckling as we walked out of the theater into the parking lot.<br />I suspect that all baby boomers will get a big kick out of seeing this film - at home or in the theater! A terrific entertainment value.
0393312836|5.0|This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite books.  The story is written in first-person and follows the adventures of a teenager named Alex.  Alex and his gang of 'droogs' are one of the many gangs that take over London after the sun has gone down, doing whatever they feel like whether that is beating, robbing, violating, or occasionally killing.  Eventually, Alex is betrayed when some of his 'droogs' feel he is too harsh of a leader.  In prison, he voulenteers to be the test subject for a new treatment that would make him incapable of evil by turning him into a clockwork orange. (A person trained so that they can do only good or evil; they lose the ability to choose) He voulenters, saying he wants to do good, but really only wanting to reduce his sentence.  When he is realeased he discovers that he is powerless to stop his former victims from harming him!  The unique language invented by Burgess in the book is facinatating and really adds to the enjoyment.  But, perhapes the most amazing thing that Anthony Burgess did in the book was make Alex a likeable character, you can't help but pity him but you realize that you really shouldn't.  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the last chapter is what pulls the book together.  I first read a version with twenty chapters and then read the twenty-first; the book is great even with the absence of the final chapter, but that is what really makes it work.  Possibly my favorite book ever, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is hard to put down.
1587990717|3.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb says he's smarter than we are because he knows that he knows nothing. We, on the other hand, labor under the delusion that we do know something. He invests to profit from the inevitable train wreck somewhere down the tracks (1987, 1998, 2000), while our ignorance will destroy us  because we don't see the calamity coming. And we don't see it coming because we mistakenly thought we saw a pattern of clear vistas ahead.<br />This work is one in a long line that looks out at the world and sees only chaos. Since there are no patterns and no repetitive behavior, there cannot be any predictions based on past events or probable behavior.<br />He would have us believe that hard work, drive, creativity, etc. all play second fiddle to luck when it comes to life's successes. He bases his philosophy on Karl Popper who postulated that there were only two kinds of theories: those which are known to be wrong and those that have not yet been known to be wrong. Thus, no investment theories can hold water and no one can make sense of our uncertain world. And with this as his starting point, Taleb launches into the argument that no matter how long a trader might experience success, he will eventually \\"blow up,\\" and that blow-up will be proof that no skill was ever involved - just dumb luck. Perhaps the trader simply happened to ride the right trend for as long as it went. Thus, Taleb's corollary is that since nothing works, why waste time trying to find a \\"system?\\" It's all random anyway.<br />Although I would argue many of his suppositions, he does make excellent observations as to why traders blow up: (1) a tendency to get married to their positions, (2) a tendency to change their story as needed so as to justify their long-term investments, (3) no precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the event of losses, (4) an absence of critical thinking - they don't learn from their losses, (5) denial - refusal to stare reality in the face. But his best insight is into the failings of professional money management - \\"the firehouse effect\\" where mutual fund managers only converse with others in the industry, thereby accepting as common wisdom what an ordinary outsider would see as sheer bunk.<br />Taleb's chosen investment strategy appears to be as a hunter of crises with a game plan designed to profit from that rare, \\"ten-sigma\\" event (sigma = 1 standard deviation). He gives little insight into his own success, based on randomness, but he does favor buying out-of-the-money options. His passing remark that the Crash of '87 made him as a trader could well mean that he was long puts.<br />A thorough reading of the book leaves us caught between Fama, Merton, and Malkiel's randomness based on an efficient market being rational, and Taleb's randomness based on the market reflecting human irrationality (based on our ignorance of probability and statistics). Both sides believe that the future, for investment purposes, is unpredictable. And how did we get into this fix of playing against a stacked deck? The mathematician and probability expert in Taleb gives us his most revealing statement near the end of the book: \\"We (mankind)  have not had the incentive to develop an ability to understand probability (to make decisions) because we did not have to do so (because we lived in a deterministic world) - but the more profound reason is that we are not designed to understand things. We are built only to survive and procreate.\\"  Ugh!<br />After debunking any and all who make claims on the future, Taleb signs off with his main piece of advice: \\"Good luck.\\"<br />So what do we have for this effort? Or in Taleb's words, as he would peruse a bookstore's shelves, \\"Is this book worth my time?\\"  We get a reminder that life is the taking of chances since nothing can be assured for tomorrow. But don't we already know that? Is that not why we do study patterns and make assumptions on what has and has not worked in the past, and build on what we learn? Is that not the basis of Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions?\\" Perhaps Taleb's randomness (chaos) is merely the interval between paradigm shifts - the confusing time when one set of patterns is discredited while a new set of patterns is being validated. And what of traders blowing up, supposedly proving Taleb's contention that any previous success was luck? Were they merely unlucky, or were they foolish not to heed obvious increased risk. Abundant evidence exists that there is always sufficient warning for this long-awaited ten-sigma event that does (unlucky) traders in. Greenspan issued his warning of \\"irrational exuberance\\" at the end of 1996. And there certainly was enough financial media proclaiming \\"it's different this time\\" to remind everybody that there has been a \\"previous time\\"  that was different. Surely there was enough \\"preparation\\" or patterns to warn anyone who wanted to consider risk. Mathematicians may dominate the derivatives trade, but the stock market is as much about investor psychology and real economic progress as it is about probability distribution theory. But yes, the book is worth your time. It makes you question what you believe and gives you an opportunity to confirm what you know (a statement that Taleb would certainly never accept).at not the basis of Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions?\\" Perhaps Taleb's randomness (chaos) is merely the interval between paradigm shifts - the confusing time when one set of patterns is discredited while a new set of patterns is being validated.

B00005JM20|2.0|I love Rowan Atkinson. Love 'im, love 'im, love 'im. The man is funny. But good lord, this movie could have been a whole lot better. Bond via Bean? Yes, but sorely lacking in so many departments...<br />You see, someone said to some movie executives \\"let's make a movie with that Bean guy again and see if it makes more money.\\" If you haven't seen Bean:The Movie, you shouldn't. It cost probably less than $30 to make and that's including a hefty fee for Burt Reynolds. But it made a killing around the world and thinking of all that money persuaded the studio to offer Atkinson another movie. <br />The Johnny English character was originally created for Barclaycard (Visa) adverts in the UK in the early 1990's. Amusing, clever, and certainly referential to the Bond franchise, no-one would have considered it ripe for a movie. But hey, when the studio is laying out the cash, anything goes. But then, the studio says \\"Well, it has to appeal to the greatest number of potential viewers, so lets leave out a lot of stuff that fans would know and appreciate.\\" Which is why this movie runs a painfully long 80 minutes. At least that's what the timer read; I kept leaving the room during the more excrutiating moments.<br />I love Atkinson, I do, but the English character is a mess. You don't know if he's supposed to be a bit thick, a clumsy chump, or just really lucky. There is absolutely nothing to develop him as a person. You don't even know if he's supposed to be an agent or a desk clerk. Rather than a Walter Mitty fantasy, however, English bumbles along from cue to cue and offers Atkinson a chance to do his mugging, which was great for a mute character like Bean, but cringe worthy in a spy spoof. <br />Malkovich chews through his scenes, but overall, this would have been a great one-hour special for cable instead of the full movie treatment. The DVD has a few specials, but a hastily assembled \\"Spy Tips\\" feature just re-hashes bits from the movie. I wanted to watch the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" but decided against it, as I couldn't bear watching what they cut because they hoped to attract more people. There was also a \\"Making Of..\\" feature, but I gave up after they focused too much on filming one explosion. Good grief, when that's more interesting than the movie, it doesn't bode well. It's middle of the road for a DVD release as far as extras go.<br />It was reported that Rowan Atkinson took some time off to treat a mild depression after the reviews of this film came back. It's a shame, because he is truly one of the greatest modern comedians that Britain has produced. But I don't think it was his fault. I mean, who walked into the studio meeting and said \\"Can our problems be solved by using Natalie Imbruglia in this movie?\\"<br />Here's hoping Atkinson exercises a little more caution in the future when choosing film projects; or at least goes with a studio that makes movies for a fanbase instead of a marketing demographic. Two out of five stars.
B00011RPB0|5.0|It's nice when a film that's been praised so much actually lives up to the hype. That's definitely the case with this excellent film. &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; Sofia Coppola's follow-up to her remarkable debut, &quot;The Virgin Suicides,&quot; is a beautiful, subtle, funny and touching film. The uncomplicated plot revolves around two Americans staying in Tokyo; a middle-aged movie star (Bill Murray) and the young wife of a photographer (Scarlett Johansson). Both characters are lonely, isolated, and experiencing serious culture shock, so despite their age difference they come together to form a sincere and tender bond. The dazzling visuals of Tokyo and the droll humor of the supporting characters enhance the film, but never distract from the relationship between the leads that is the film's core. Bravo!<br />(PS, an added guilty pleasure: The annoying blond actress portrayed by Anna Farris in the film is rumored to a parody of Cameron Diaz!)
B000002OX5|5.0|&quot;It sucks,&quot; my friend said many years ago when offering me a vinyl copy of &quot;The Who Sell Out,&quot; an album he picked up for a buck or so in the record store's cut-out bin. He continued: &quot;It has 'I Can See for Miles' on it, but that's all. The rest is stupid.&quot;<br />So, I accepted his gift, along with his assessment of it (the cover photos did indicate that maybe my friend was right), and other than &quot;I Can See for Miles,&quot; didn't bother to listen to the rest of the album until a couple of years later.<br />It was like finding gold! It was obvious that my friend was distracted by those silly little faux commercial interuptions and public service announcements (&quot;Radio London reminds you go to the church of your choice&quot;) scattered throughout the album, and missed out on one of The Who's greatest albums.<br />Yes, it's a concept album, but unlike &quot;Tommy&quot; whose concept was as shallow as it was meant to be deep, &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; doesn't take itself seriously. It's designed to resemble a pirate radio station, the likes of which were popular in the more daring broadcast era of the Sixties, as well as a satire of sorts on the whole idea of &quot;selling out,&quot; ironic for a group that, like many others from the era that looked with disdain upon the &quot;establishment,&quot; would one day tour with the backing of large corporations.<br />&quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; is every bit the equal of &quot;Who's Next,&quot; with the top 40 hit &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; by no means the best song of the bunch. &quot;I Can't Reach You,&quot; &quot;Tattoo,&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot; are right up there with Pete Townsend's finest work, and John Entwistle's contribution, the moody &quot;Silus Stingy&quot; is no slouch either.<br />Finally, after years of being combined with another pre-&quot;Tommy&quot; Who album in a budget priced LP combo, this album's CD incarnation gives it the respect it deserves. The bonus tracks are a nice addition, but with music this good who needs extras?us tracks are a nice addition, but with music this good who needs extras?
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The improvements made on the original Phil Spector modified record are amazing. Regardless of how beautiful the songs are without the excessive post-production (which is another topic altogether) the sheer fidelity of this recording truly stands out. I always felt that the original Let It Be was unusual for a Beatles record because of its thin and weak sound and rampant overcompression. The new Let It Be... Naked fully realizes the fidelity of the original recordings, albeit posthumously, with a rich, crisp and dynamic soundscape, and allows the listener to fully appreciate this great Beatles LP, perhaps even greater than we ever thought.
0385510438|4.0|After the travesty that was \\"King of Torts,\\" John Grisham returns with a novel that appears, on the cover, to be another legal thriller but is, in fact, something else entirely.  This is not about courtroom theatrics or terrible murders or greedy, corrupt lawyers seeking justice that will benefit their pocketbooks.  No, \\"The Last Juror\\" is much, much different than your typical Grisham fare.<br />It is a story of humanity.  John Grisham has entered a new field while treading on familiar territory.  He has written something that touches the pulse of the 1970's in Ford County.  This is the story of Willie Traynor, newspaper editor, and his friendship with Callie Ruffin, a black woman and mother of eight, and a fledgling newspaper founded on obituaries.  Danny Padgitt's actions are known fairly early on, and there truly is no question as to his guilt.<br />There are some courtroom theatrics here, but they are secondary to the relationship between Willie and Miss Callie; indeed, the courtroom scenes are secondary to the character development and onset of desegregation that the denizens of Ford County are faced with.  If anything, \\"The Last Juror\\" is the sort of novel one would expect to read in a 20th Century literature class.  There is a fair amount of suspense, and there is some criticism of the legal system (70's and current) and of course a bit of preaching, but it all works.<br />Grisham has crafted one of his best novels and given us a slew of memorable characters; the Ruffin family will stay with you long after completing the novel.  As will Willie and the eclectic bunch of \\"old folks\\" who dominate the town.  Social criticism is also a bit heavy, with the arrival of Bargain City and the Padgitt clan's unsavory vocations.  I would hesitate to compare this to such literary giants as \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" the major theme in \\"The Last Juror\\" is similar to that found in both the aforementioned novels, that of racial tolerance and the transendance of boundaries.<br />But, when the jurors start to fall, you will believe that Danny Padgitt is indeed guilty of fulfilling his promise...but then Grisham wants you to believe it, which makes the ending all the more impactful.<br />Be wary, diehards and casual fans--this is not your typical John Grisham.

0802130208|5.0|Probably the funniest book I've ever come across, it, unlike a lot of novels that are humorous, has a great plot and wonderfully defined characters. So many books that are funny are simply small episodes strung together with no real &quot;meat.&quot;  Not the case with CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.  <br />Why it's taken this long for Hollywood to make this into a movie is beyond me (and it's still not done!)  Everything is right there--the brilliant dialogue, the great setting of New Orleans, and the star character, Ignatius.  <br />But forget about whether or not Hollywood succeeds with their attempt at this Southern classic.  After all, they've managed to mangle other works like MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL and a few others.  And if they don't do justice to CONFEDERACY they'll certainly be hearing from several generations who have come to love this book.  <br />The only bad thing I can say about CONFEDERACY is that you'll never be able to actually own a copy for yourself--you'll be continuously giving away which ever copy you have at the moment, whenever you find someone who hasn't read this magical, entertaining, and rollicking book.  <br />It sounds cliche to say &quot;this is a classic,&quot; but that's exactly what it is.<br />Also recommended:  THE MOVIE GOER, NEON BIBLE, BARK OF THE DOGWOOD

0743216458|5.0|Stephen Ambrose successfully captured the moments of 101st Airborne. This book was dedicated to the soldiers who gave their lives during World War II. It followed the footsteps of E company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne or well known as the ¡§Screaming Eagles¡¨.<br />As a top elite parachute regiments, men in ¡§Easy¡¨ company had their toughest experience in their lives. They first met as a group in Camp Toccoa, Georgia. They all came from different places and background but with one goal ¡§to serve their country well¡¨. They later were sent to Europe to fight the ¡§Jerries¡¨ or the Germans. They parachuted through the sky of Normandy. They fought against time in Holland. They were in the freezing foxholes of Bastogne. They fought bravely as a group. They had heavy casualties. Brothers and friends were lost. They somehow survived through the harsh time of the war. It was because of these moments that the men of E company began to trust their brother soldiers and later became ¡§Band of Brothers¡¨.<br />The book told individual stories of E company. For example Major Richard Winter, who was basically the most incredible person of the whole company. He led the group with intelligence and ¡§common sense¡¨. He led the group through all the battles they went through and never forgetting his soldiers when raised for a higher rank. He gained more than just respect from the men of Easy. They had love like brotherhood which made them unique from other companies.<br />Stephen Ambrose recorded every action, operation or even patrols of Easy Company. The book is very detailed in every action taken, with colorful and exciting lines. Dialogues and social talk between men made me as the reader more into the actual battle. Different perspectives were written down to show the characteristic of each person.<br />There are pictures and maps in the book to make sure the reader follow along. The book is very ¡§real¡¨ side of the war. It showed the true feeling of soldiers trying to survive through harsh conditions. This book moved many readers including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who later made this book into an HBO TV series, ¡¥Band of Brothers¡¨.<br />I would recommend this book to people who are interesting in history of the 101st airborne and World War II. This book is simply a forgettable classic.

0385510438|5.0|THE LAST JUROR reads like a cross between some of Grisham's more famous courtroom thrillers and two of his other novels: A PAINTED HOUSE and BLEACHERS.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, for what seems to have happend is this--he's developed his writing styles and ideas into one finely-tuned work of fiction with a compelling story, great characters, and all the color and tension of the South.<br />There are too many elements to this book to mention here, but one of the more intriguing aspects is that of the old south vs. the new.  Add to this the eccentric townspeople that Grisham parades before us, throw in some humidity and racial tension, a few unpainted storefronts, a great plot, wonderful pacing and dialogue, and you've got THE LAST JUROR.  <br />Of all of Grisham's work, this one is by far his best.

B00009L1TA|2.0|The principal thought that came to mind as I watched BASIC was how desperately Southern California needs rain.<br />John Travolta is Tom Hardy, and ex-Army Ranger turned DEA agent cooling his heels in Panama while under investigation for taking a bribe. An old Army pal, the commanding officer of the local Ranger training unit, conscripts Hardy to interrogate a trainee that returned carrying a wounded comrade from a jungle exercise, during which the other four participants were killed, presumably by each other. Among the dead is Sgt. Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson), a kick-butt and much hated instructor, who ostensibly arranges \\"training accidents\\" for chronic losers who don't make the Ranger grade and are too stupid to realize it. Hardy, a trained interrogator, is needed on the case because the local provost officer, Lt. Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen), isn't up to the task, especially as pressure is expected from Washington since the wounded man is the son of a government big shot.<br />Much of the run time is devoted to flashbacks, in which the audience sees various versions of the story, as told to Hardy by the survivors, as to what happened out in the jungle. In the aggregate, all versions only muddy the issue. The confusion of it all is heightened by the fact that the apparent murders, starting with Sgt. West's, happen at night in a driving rain storm, and all the participants are decked out in camouflage uniforms and grease paint. The audience, or at least this viewer, never achieved certainty as to who was who and what was what. None of the supporting players outside of Hardy and Osborne established much in the way of screen identity.<br />And speaking of driving rain, Hardy and Osborne occasionally wander out into it, but they never seem to be even damp once they get back indoors. Even carrying a big umbrella and wearing rain gear, I'd come out of such a storm looking like a drowned dog.

0385504209|2.0|This seems to be the book of the year and shows no signs of slowing down. I was excited to read it, but that came to a grueling end as I trudged through Brown's \\"research.\\" My college freshman English professor would of marked down my paper with such flimsy research. It took me all of two minutes to find on the internet that the sect Opus Dei does not even have monks. One of the main characters of the book could not even exist, so much for Dan's research. I also would question that five million women were killed as witches in the Middle Ages. My research could only find that maybe 15,000 died, while sad, not close to the 5,000,000 stated in the book. As for the story of Mary Magdalene and Jesus' marriage, that has been around for years and is nothing new, as most of the reading public seems to believe. And just because Dan says it is true does not make it true. I had such hopes for this book and was sorley disappointed.
B00018D44U|3.0|The best thing about this album is that her voice still sounds great. I would recommend any fan buy it for this simple fact.<BR>However, the jazzy vibe and the &quot;pop&quot; tinged melodies of her debut seem to have been replaced with an unfortunate country twang. James Taylor does this sometimes, too. For those of us who are not fans of country music, it can be quite difficult to take.
B00005JLSE|5.0|If you don't like musicals, it's a waste of time and money to watch this. Unless you're like me--someone who thought a movie with songs every five seconds isn't a...movie (like SHOWBOAT). But when I saw this, CHICAGO, I saw the error in my ways. <BR>  Anyone who thinks the acting is bad is a terrible judge. Renee Zellweger draws just the right feelings from the audience: she can make you hate, adore, and want to kill the character Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones is at the top of her game as the notorious Velma Kelly (&quot;it was a murder, but not a crime&quot;). I'd like to thank the Academy for giving her the Oscar. And let me tell you: Meryl Streep is my favorite, favorite actress of ALL time (and this is coming from a true movie buff), but I am still so glad that Zeta-Jones got the Oscar. Sorry for your loss, Meryl. <BR> Don't get me started about how much I loved Richard Gere. Playing the suave, charming, yet self-helping lawyer Billy Flynn, I grin every time I see him come onto the screen. His song, &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; is my dad's favorite, and a real toe-tapper. The songs are incredible, my favorites being the Cell Block Tango, Both Reached For The Gun, and the ever-lasting All That Jazz. The dances are so well choreographed, too. <BR>  And how can anyone say this movie is boring and slow?! The pace is quick, the acting stupendous, and the dialogue is sharp and witty. This film easily blends humor, drama (HUNYAK!! POOR HUNYAK!!!), and of course songs amazingly well. One of the film's best aspects is its beautiful cinematography. Bottom Line: This is one of the best musicals we've had for a while!
B00006RINF|3.0|good music...hot lead singer...but i'm just not into the female vocals...if you like evanescence hehehe you'll like this...
B00009P1O5|5.0|I don't understand why so many people must feel so submissive to professional critics about this CD. I was eighteen when I began a long \\"friendship\\" with N. Young's music, and it started with this CD (Then LP). And, by the way, it was a very demanding introduction. It is not an easy album, I agree. But one feels that these songs come from a very special mind. Like starting to listen Zappa from Joe's garage, or something.
B00005JM02|5.0|and they can spell too so that's one up on the people that gave Nemo bad reviews here.  This is a great movie.  My daughter is two and it is the ONLY movie she will sit still for so that means a lot to us.  As adults we enjoy the movie too which is well written and beautifully animated.  I can't say enough about how entertaining this movie is and the dvd has some great bonus material.  There is an incredible documentary where you and your children can learn much more about the ocean.  As with all Disney films there are some dark undertones and you really have to pay attention if your children scare easily.  Just reassure them and they will be fine.  Stop reading these reviews and go get this dvd!

Come next year !!\\" :-)<BR>Please have pity on our souls.<BR>Seinfeld DVD !!!Seinfeld DVD !!!Seinfeld DVD !!!Seinfeld DVD !!!
B00018D44U|4.0|She's an artist with great vocals.  I listen to her for vocal talent, not necessarily the lyrics..yes, they need work but at least she can sing.  too much of music today has not a shred of real talent to present, just pretty faces.  You can hear many influences in there, and it was even apparent on her first album.  This album is more raw, which is not entirely a bad thing. The \\"country\\" sound everyone is talking about is more of a blues based sound than country..One song is bluegrass, with Dolly Parton..The rest of the reviews on here are misleading.  This is Folk/Blues with a traditional jazz song at the end.  Good album, with room for more great music to come.
B00000F5KH|1.0|This film was purchased for a Brazilian studies class.  The film is ruined by the commentaries throughout the entire movie.  You cannot hear the lilting Brazilian Portuguese in the background.
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|Underworld has a great premise with the conflict of Vampire and Werewolves fighting over domination but while it's a good premise, it needs a story to support it, and if you don't have a good story then you don't really have anything. The movie is more style than substance, and while style is good, it can also ruin a movie if you don't have anything to back it up. Kate Beckinsale and company do their best with what is giving but even their best efforts can't hide the fact that the story feels like it was written on the fly, and rush into production with out a good rewrite to help punch up the script. On top of that, the special effects are of not top quality, and you can see that in the way the Werewolves look and move. You really don't them at all, and when you do, it's very brief and mostly in the dark. <br />With better special effects, and a real story that made sense, this could have been the ultimate Action/ Horror movie but because they decided to cheap out on both the story and effects, we have this travesty
0066214122|5.0|Having just finished (on March 27, 2003) BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON by Dean Koontz, which dealt with a more fanciful, but equally enjoyable, depiction of nanotechnology, I was pleased to be swept up again into this pseudo-scientific world via Michael Crichton's novel, PREY.<br />Invariably, I find Crichton's novels to be both educational and entertaining, since he explains every technical nuance with remarkable precision without boring the reader.  Consistent with his trademark attention to detail, excellent character and plot development, and absorbing method of storytelling, Crichton has achieved another literary success with PREY. The ending was especially thought provoking, albeit somewhat unnerving, causing me to view computer science with a tad more appreciation-AND suspicion.
B00006879E|5.0|There are very few CD's that I can actually enjoy all the way through - but this is one of those exceptions.  I love *every* song on the CD, the style is just different enough to catch your attention, and I was immediately attracted to the sound.  Love it - it's that simple.
B000002UUX|5.0|this is best metal album ever made!<BR>all the songs are masterpiece<BR>great  drum ,solos,riff,bassline and everything<BR>really worth buying
B000089RVX|4.0|I have always been a fan of rock bands with female singers, Lacuna Coil and Lullacry are the 2 that stand out for mr, so I decided to give these guys, and girl, a try. I got so sick of their first single, played way too much. I bought it thinking it would be a great album. I was sort of let down, so I gave it away. Later on, listening to them when I sister was playing their CD, I got more and more into it. The vocals are great, the beat is good, the drums and guitars are okay. Not to say that the songs are bad, but I can tell that they have a lot of talent they are not displaying. I think with the next album, they should try some guitar solos, more double bass drumming, and make it sound more like rock than pop. I liked the samples and the keyboards, added great background effects, so they did not detract from the album at all. Good album with half upbeat songs and half slower. I am sure they would get a lot more fans playing more faster songs. Get it, and enjoy it, something different but catchy.

0679721037|5.0|Hiroshima is a book I read when I was in 9th grade. I decided to reread this book after learning that my grandfather's brother died during the deadly atomic bomb massacre in Hiroshima on August 1945, when there was nothing but sounds of death everywhere. <BR>Until this day, my country Korea fights with Japan for various reasons starting from entertainment to history. Reading a book with full of sympathy of my country's rival Japan may not sound appropriate, since the majority dislike Japanese people and several think they deserved the sufferings from the atomic bomb attack. After all, they were the ones who invaded Korea and did unforgivable war crimes during the Second World War. However, after finishing this book...I learned that I was wrong, very wrong indeed. <BR>This book explains fully about the suffrages of the bomb from death, pain, anguish and sadness. After reading Hiroshima and my Grandfathers story of his dead brother I learned something special, Japan's pain from war was not any different to Korea's suffrage and the sadness and pain is what we all shared during war. Furthermore, I felt guilty to think that Japan deserved it, and that it is not right to blame Japan for everything.<BR>This book is a collection of interviews by John Hersey, all interviewed straight after the bomb attack. Hersey managed to interview six survivors who managed to live and was able to escape from the edge of death. The six survivors include Miss Toshinki Sasaki, a clerk, Dr. Masakazu Fuji, a physician, Mrs. Nakamura, widow, Father Kleinsorge, priest, Dr. Sasaki, and Mr. Tanimoto. All six interviews were unbelievable, and sounded almost like a miracle that they managed to survive through the devastating bomb. Hersey writes his interviews very emotionally and this helped me understand the survivors feelings more closely, making me emotional as well. <BR>Miss Sasaki's (Toshinki) interview was most interesting to me. Her experience during the attack was unique compared to the other survivors. What made her unique was her story of being a cripple, a hibakusha some say. Japanese called the survivors from the bomb, `hibakusha?and this definitely was not a pleasant word to say. Miss Sasaki lost her fianc?due to this dishonorable name Hibakusha. Reading her sorrow of losing her waiting love, the letter of guilt from her fianc? and herself to live on as a Hibakusha, lead me to the peak of sadness. To get rid of her pain she decides to become a nun. She said `More notice should be given to the causes than to the instruments of total war?and yes I fully agree with her, war is meaningless. Most of the time I felt sympathy in this interview and it was hard to stop reading. <BR>My favorite quote and a quote that I would never forget come from Miss Sasaki's interview. `I shall not dwell on the past, I prefer not to look back and I shall keep moving forward? Many of us dwell on the past and some take it hard to accept change. I experienced it, but I too learned that it is meaningless to dwell hopelessly on the past. The only solution is to have a dream, make an aim, move forward, and end your life without regret. <BR>I really enjoyed reading this book, it helped me understand what war is like and like the New York Times said `Everyone able to read should read it? I recommend this book to everyone studying WW2 or Japan's history. In addition, to read one's experience becoming successful under difficult conditions, which is rare to see in nowadays society.<br />Lastly I would like to conclude that Hiroshima doesn't aim only on the suffering and consequences of the bomb brought to Japanese people, but to show what terror we have done to those innocent people and to show our emotions as a human. It is an unforgettable disaster for our humanity, and the book wants to shout that this should never happen again, in future.
B000002H33|1.0|this is the most overrated metal album of all time<br />nothing special ,just regular metal album<br />its not really bad album but there's so many album that  better then this, maybe metallica fans can only say &quot;this album sold alot then other bands album&quot; ok, that's a fact i know. but, dont forget sales mean nothing to proof quality, backstreet boys album sold more then 10 M too just like black album.<br />master of puppet sold 6 million in 18 years. 50 cents album sold 6 million in one year. SO SALES DOESN T PROOF<br />so honestly i never like this album much,<br />the title trackis good, also orion.
B000099T2L|5.0|First of all, it is clear that some of these reviews were written without even listening to the album, and more than half are based on opinions of the singer and not her music, which is what is really important here.<br />But anyway, Beyonce definitely deserved her Grammys. This album is my favorite release of 2003. The first four songs are amazing, then she slows things down for the rest of the album. But, these ballads are only boring to non-R&B fans. Yes, Be With You, and Speechless are wonderful. The duet with Luther is moving (thats why it won a Grammy) and DIL2 is a great version of the song from Destiny's Child's Survivor album.<br />All in all, I really liked this album. The only track i skip in the interlude b/c it makes no sense! but other than that, she's done a great job and is going to continue to make her mark on music history... haters or no haters!
B00008WG3U|5.0|Just when you thought an old punk band like NOFX was going to get washed up, they release a masterpiece. This album is nothing short of a satirical piece of art. Fat Mike's nasally vocals take shots at the entire nation, holding nothing back...with titles like &quot;The Idiots are Taking Over&quot; and &quot;Franco Un-American&quot;. The true greatness is shown when the band shows they have the guts to somehow rhyme 'apathy' with 'Noam Compsky'...genius. From track one &quot;The Seperation of Church and Skate&quot; to the last &quot;Whoops. I OD'd&quot; NOFX delivers one of their best albums.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is hands down the best Hip-Hop album that has hit the stands in awhile.  I would swear my life on it.  I can't get enough of it.  \\"All Falls Down\\" is a great song, and we all know about \\"Through The Wire\\".  \\"Get Em High\\" is a hot track, that needs tons of playing time, it sounds straight underground.  It Even has a better version of \\"Slow Jamz\\".  Cop it, or you'll be missing out.
156898443X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was deep, thoughtful, warm and simple yet wise.  It reminded me of Le Petit Prince.  It is certainly true that we don't enjoy and appreciate life because we don't look at the beauty in front of us, and it is likewise certainly true that we are so focused on what we want that we don't appreciate what we get.  I thought it was well worth spending the hour required to read this book to be reminded of these basic truths, because happiness is all in the mind.
0385510438|1.0|This is by far the worst ever Grisham book.  It is like no other Grisham, in that there is barely any courtroom action.  The chapters seem thrown together, and NOTHING happens.  The only reason I kept reading was to see if anything would develop.  Read any other Grisham.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This has to be Hans Zimmer's best movie score yet. The score is totally moving and emotional which captures the spirit of the movie. What are you waiting for, this is the score of the year.
B00005ALRO|5.0|Fantastic thriller!  Harrison Ford plays the part of a surgeon who comes home to find his wife the victim of a break-in and is accused and convicted of her murder.  On his way to prison, he escapes and while trying to keep from getting captured, he tries to find the real murderer.  Tommy Lee Jones, a U.S. Marshall, is hot on his trail.  Harrison Ford is good, but Tommy Lee Jones puts the icing on the cake in this exciting movie.  Wonderful movie from start to finish!  Enjoy!
B0001AP12G|5.0|The last time I really listened to Jay Z was during his Orginal Flavor &amp; Jazz days. Therefore, I never really paid attention to who was producing him. After Kayne produced a few tracks for Talib and Mos Def, I decided to take a closer look. I'm so glad I did. This cat is fire! His concepts, thought provoking lyrics and beats are classic. Please go get this one.
6302800420|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is a fantastic character actor, one of the all time greats.  He is superb in this movie.  He is an actor who can't get a job as a man but through circumstances, ends up getting a woman's part in a soap opera.  The cast thinks he is a woman and it really was funny watching Hoffman try to keep them from learning he was a man.  This movie was really funny and yet it had a lot of drama and humanity included.<br /> I found his portrayal of a woman more interesting and likable than that of the male character, in fact, there were times that I would get so wrapped up in the character, Dorothy, that I would forget that he was a man acting as a woman.  The cast, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, Charles Durney, Geena Davis, were all great.  <br />This is one of those movies that will be remembered for years to come!  Enjoy!
B00000637V|5.0|This album really makes you wish Lou Reed could bring himself to collaborate more often, or at least work with a producer. Not on every album, mind you, but perhaps every third or fourth. Lou is an uncompromising artist who has reiterated (and demonstrated) time and again his commitment to putting his ideas directly to tape, with a minimum of messing around or outside input (in many cases, without even bothering to get a clean sound). This is admirable, and ultimately, it's a lot of what we love about Lou. But listening to this album, you just can't help but wish that, at least once in a while, he'd let somebody help him fill in the musical gaps in his recordings, and polish them up a bit. Not to make them more saleable, but to help get the message across. Bob Ezrin's arrangements teter on the brink of excess, which makes them nearly perfect for this set of songs. They give the music an emotional wallop that it just wouldn't have otherwise. It's startling to hear Lou Reed in this setting, sounding larger than life. I'm guessing he found it a little unsettling himself. But would &quot;How Do You Think It Feels&quot; work as well without the brass? Would &quot;Sad Song&quot; sound as tragic without the &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; strings? Sometimes, more is more. Though not always (see _Sally Can't Dance_). <br />I seem to recall reading somwhere that this was intended to be a double album originally, and that Bob Ezrin had to do a fair amount of trimming to fit it onto a single LP when RCA dragged their feet. It's a shame somebody couldn't have dug up the full-length master for this reissue (although, I guess that would've required RCA's reissue department to get their head out of their ..., which doesn't seem likely to happen anytime soon).
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis has written a phenomenal book here.  Like all good non-fiction, Moneyball tells a slice-of-life story that has applications and implications for virtually all areas of life.  The overarching theme--that what we know may just not be so, and that value in people, even in what some may consider a trivial pursuit, baseball, is not always subject to the \\"conventional wisdom\\"--resonates through every page and through every character.  Having watched the Oakland-Kansas City game that capped the A's 20-game winning streak in 2002, but having known nothing of what went into that night, I found the story of Scott Hatteburg to be full of life truths.  Ditto Jeremy Brown.  <br />Despite its somewhat unfortunate title, Moneyball is not to be missed.  You will put it down with a renewed determination to find the things YOU are undervaluing in life because of myths you have been taught.  The most likely target of this refreshing approach is YOURSELF.
B00018D44U|5.0|One word: Beautiful.  I love the laid back melodies and the beautiful words Norah sings.  I eagerly awaited this CD and already know this will be my new Sunday favorite.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's sucks that once again the TV Bosses of this world have knocked off yet another great show. I was excited to see a series revolving around the future. It had imagination and great sets with believable characters. I hope someday that the TV Bosses will stop knocking off great shows that PEOPLE REALLY DO WATCH AND ENJOY!!!! Instead of basing everything on profit and marketablility.........Disappointed again in California.
B000001FCB|5.0|Superlatives do no good. I was going through the vinyl collection of a 60+ year old friend and stopped at this disc. Bob said he picked it up in Brazil back in the 70's and explained what a huge record it was back in that day. Well I borrowed it, slapped it on my SOTA and through the scratches came the most enchanting and genuine of sounds. Instant love. The charm and chemistry of the two is undeniable as you laugh along. Other parts set a mood that is pure romance and relaxation. I ran the record through ProTools and descratched it, only to find the CD release some months later. This a great soundtrack for a warm easy summer day or a cold urban winter night. Gentle, honest and affectionate music. Great for sharing. One of the all too rare true gems.
B00006F7IM|5.0|It's not a deep drama and it won't make you ask you any tough questions of yourself, but Major League is pure entertainment from beginning to end. As such, it's my all-time favorite movie. It's easy to invest in the story (a Cleveland team made up of spare parts tries to overcome their owner's plot to move the franchise) even if it's been dated by the Indians' '90s success. The comedy doesn't pull any punches but still stays pretty tasteful, and I still find it laugh-out-loud funny even after 30+ viewings. The comedy is equal parts outstanding writing by David S. Ward and brilliant characterizations by the actors. James Gammon is dead-on as grizzled manager Lou Brown and Tom Berenger is actually sympathetic as journeyman catcher Jake Taylor. Dennis Haysbert and Corbin Bernsen give great performances, and Charlie Sheen is inimitable as Wild Thing Vaughn. I think any baseball fan will enjoy this movie, but fans of good comedy will probably like it, too.<br />The DVD has no special features (what else do you expect from Paramount?), but the picture and sound are good.<br />Movie: 6/5<BR>DVD: 4/5<BR>Overall: 5/5
B00005JMGL|5.0|I know that this movie's sets, special effects, and music score are all spectacular and noteworthy, but I think acting is most important above all.<br />Rachel Hurd-Wood, as Wendy, definitely deserves the most credit of everyone in the cast, even more credit than Jason Isaacs as Hook/Mr. Darling, because her performance is the most emotional and affecting, and it's way beyond what you would expect from most movie newcomers.  No doubt this is one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history.  Long gone is that annoyingly prissy Wendy we've seen in previous adaptations.  Finally, we are treated to the deep, heart-felt emotions of the pivotal character Wendy Darling, not to mention some exhilarating youthful ebullience as well.  Rachel expresses all those things with supreme believability, pure intelligence, and ethereal quality, and NEVER seems stiff and NEVER goes over the top.  The scenes when she cries are so affecting that they are guaranteed to make viewers cry.  Thank you for doing such a magnificent job, Rachel.  You made this movie worth all 5 stars!
B00005JM02|3.0|This film is good value. The people at pixar have put together another great movie. I must admit this movie is very much overrated. It is NOT the best movie I have ever seen. The movie tells the story of a fish called Nemo who gets kidnapped by a diver. Marlin(Nemos dad) and his friend Dory (who has short term memory loss) must find Nemo who is trapped in a fish tank at a dental surgery. great laughs with Dory and a good storyline but definetely not the best youll ever see. Watch Shrek instead.
B000021XS0|5.0|Some of the best musicians ever together in a band writing an amazing prog album that imo no one has been able to top. Every instrument fits in perfectly and the vocals are amazing. Anyone who enjoys good music has to like at least some aspects of this album. you really cant go wrong buying it.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This is a great set of songs.  I'd call it a more artsy release because the songs are mostly very different from what PJ would release on their albums (probably why the songs didn't get put on the albums).  But together they compile a wonderful variation of raw, almost punkish, balls-out rock n' roll.  If you are a Pearl Jam fan or just a fan of good rock music...  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!
B00011RPB0|1.0|This is the sort of movie that pretentious artsy people love to rave about.  When asked to explain, they simply mimic the reviews, which seem to be about Sophia Coppola's 'astounding talent' more than anything else.<br />To say the movie is slow paced is  careless understatement.  It is positively tedious.  It is also a waste of a fine talent (Murray).   Let's sum up what all the reviews allude to in such grandiose terms:  two lonely people who have little else in common meet in Japan and moon over each other for a week, failing to even find happiness in each other's company.  They then part, lonely and unfulfilled as before.  The brief relationship (if it can be called such)  they experienced will never continue because it is based on nothing.<br />I've seen most of Bill Murray's movies.  To hear reviews stating that he was 'never finer' is mind blowing.  He appears to be in a catatonic state,  and to suggest his facial expressions are moving or descriptive is to stretch the imagination.   This is not a movie, but a slide show, and an exceedingly poor one to boot.  Even the continuous and gratuitous shots of Johannson's see thru-undies are a waste of time.  A lost child is not sexy.<br />And if, perchance, the movie was supposed to be depressing or sad, it missed that mark as well.  It simply comes across as abstract art, which anyone can mindlessly rave about without qualification,  regardless of substance or lack thereof.<br />This movie tries to be a foreign film, an art film, an indie film, and it fails miserably at each.  I only hope Bill Murray is not so delusional as to believe this to be his Magnum Opus.

Kanye is not only one of the best producers in the industry, but he is also one of the best lyricists out.  Production gets and A++++(All tracks produced by Kanye West).

B0000042H4|5.0|You can argue about the best version of the Ring Cycle but no reasonable individual can disagree with the proposition that the Solti Ring is superb.  The cast is simply incredible, featuring the incomparable Birgit Nilsson as Brunnhilde and a wonderful Wolfgang Windgassen as Siegfried.  A galaxy of other great singers give outstanding performances.  These recordings were made over a period of years but Solti maintains a remarkable consistency of style and interpretation.  The great Vienna Phimharmonic has ravishing sound.  Transferred to CD from the original stereo recordings, the engineers did an excellent job of preserving the wonderful sound.  These recordings have a bit more noise than modern digital recordings but the quality of the music is appropriately preserved.  A bonus is that this is the most reasonably priced Ring set available.

B0000640VO|5.0|The visuals and music in AMELIE is amazing! Also, the starring actress if pretty easy on the eyes.<br />The DP on this film has an encredible eye for composition, balance, and color. It's obvious they did tons of color correction and filtering, but it augments the movie rather than detracting from it or distracting the viewer.<br />The soundtrack is incredible and it sits in my CD-magazine in my car.
B000002L9J|5.0|It is a harrowing task. One wants to do justice when writing a review of this album. Not only is it a flawless recording musically, but it is also an unequivocally important album to me personally. Morrissey and Marr, in my opinion, are the greatest songwriters of all time. I mean that. Lyrically, Morrissey is so much better than anyone else it's just silly. He is clever, witty, intelligent, controversial, and he understands that what makes an a song unforgettable is the writer's ability to touch the listener's heart. Seriously, does anyone do that better than Steven? His lyrical prowess combined with Johnny Marr's preternatural tunesmithing are perfection realized on &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;. All of The Smith's albums are at least very good, but this one is flawless. Part of what separates it from the rest is the fact that Morrissey's sense of humor is more present on this album than any other. That fact is established immediately with the title track which includes razor sharp barbs at the Queen and Prince Charles. The rhythm section is tighter than a flea's arse throughout, as it always was. Andy rourke's bass playing is so fluid and natural, and Mike Joyce is so good he's like a drumming android. The two keep time better than a rolex. The ballad &quot;I know it's over&quot; is beautiful, and features Morrissey's most heartfelt lyrics. He invokes such anguish that it's impossible not to get goosebumps. &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; is an excellent, and somewhat underappreciated song. It has an upbeat tempo, and combines Johnny Marr's infectious acoustic guitar and more of Morissey's wit. Morrissey's love of Oscar Wilde is proclaimed on the song(as if we didn't know). &quot;Bigmouth Srikes Again&quot; and &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in his Side&quot; are two of the best Smiths songs ever. Marr uses an acoustic for the rhythm tracks once again along with electric leads. &quot;Bigmouth&quot; features an interesting effect in which Morrissey's vocals are sped up and used as a backing vocal during the chorus. The result is that the listener hears a very high backing vocal alongside Morrissey's normal lead vocal. It is the only time that The Smiths used this effect. &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot; is the most blatantly funny song on the album. Morrissey's lyrics are clever and poke fun at the church, as Morrisey is wont to do, as he sings about the precarious vicar. &quot;Vicar...&quot; is followed by &quot;There is a Light that Never Goes Out&quot;, which is arguably the best Smiths song(and arguably the bet song by anyone). The song's narrator laments an unrealized love and goes so far to wish to die in an accident with this person because it would be the perfect ending. In the end however he just goes on with the knowledge that he shall be alone, which is a familiar theme for a Smiths song, but the notion is conveyed most effectively here. Obviously, any Smiths fan knows the importance of the band and the importance of &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;. But if you have yet to discover the band and have been intrigued by what you've heard or read, then you should start with the self titled debut album and then work your way through the second album &quot;Meat is Murder&quot;, and then to &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;. That way you can grow as a listener the way The Smiths grew as a band. Hopefully, you will enjoy the experience as much as I have.
6305692572|2.0|After you've seen Susan Hayward and Gena Rowlands play drunks, Meg Ryan falls a little flat.  Sorry, but that's the truth!  And at least Miss Hayward threw some tunes your way when she was battling the booze. <br />Meg Ryan is too &quot;pretty&quot; and you never really believe she is drunk, at any time.  To be real, they needed to add some really bad bags under her eyes, and some racoon mascara like what Helen Hunt did in &quot;Pay it Forward,&quot; not a great performance, but passable.  Of course, I don't think Meg Ryan cares to &quot;ugly up&quot; for a role.  This movie just plain stunk.  And Andy Garcia, he was really fake also, no chemistry with Meg Ryan either. Maybe he could not get into her cardboard acting, who knows.  The movie is funny to watch because there are so many scenes where you just cringe at the hokey dialog and wooden acting.  This wasn't the drama vehicle scriptwise for Meg Ryan, let's leave it at that.  The only consolation we have is that 10 years later, she has to take Nicole Kidman's rejects and do a screen test and appear all nude to even get a role in a flop.  There is justice!
0440214041|5.0|The Pelican Brief by John Grisham is by far THE BEST JOHN GRISHAM novel I have read so far. The Pelican Brief starts out with the deaths of two Supreme Court judges, who get assassinated by a mysterious assassin named Khamel. Now law student Darby Shaw takes a shot in the dark and writes a brief on who killed the two Supreme Court judges. Now once she finishes it, she then gives it to her lover and professor to read it, then the FBI get their hands on it, and also the President who is intrigued by this little brief. <BR> Now as the brief gets around, Darby's professor is killed by a car bomb which was intended for him and her! But she escapes thanks to his drunken state. Now she is on the run, and the killers want her dead at any cost. Then she runs into a Washington Post writer, and they get into contact. She tells him about the brief and joins the hunt for a mysterious man named &quot;Garcia&quot; who works for this huge firm in D.C. <BR> Now escaping death many times, Darby then finds out who &quot;Garcia&quot; really is, they then discover the whole thing, and they report it in print, and now everyone is going down; including some of the President's men. Why did the huge firm want the Supreme Court judges dead? Simple. It was a case that involved a case involving the marshlands, and oil, the firm wanted to win the case, but they knew that they were going to lose if it went to the Supreme Court, so they hired a trained assassin to kill the two judges so if they can be replaced with two new judges. Interesting? I thought so.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Formulaic...insultingly so. Tea Leoni as Woman in Peril, Sam Niell as reluctant hero, Alessandro Nivola as cocky protege, William H Macy is written forgettably, and Trevor Morgan falls into place as resourceful, Spunky Kid in need of rescue. The dinosaurs are either properly villainous, or an appropriate source of harmless comic relief. <BR>Suffice it to say: a tired rehashing of gimmicky plot twists (We're stuck on the island! Raptors are back! Raptors are smarter than we thought! So-and-so is stuck in a cage, with a raptor bearing down! There's no way they could escape this tyrannosaurus! Wait, here comes another dinosaur to distract it! They'll fight and we'll escape! ) <BR>I'll save you the suspense: they didn't skimp, they gave you a \\"digging through a 4-foot, steaming pile of fecal matter\\" scene, audible slurping and squishing sounds and all. Whoever decides to do a fourth installment should save some time and money and just write it as a romantic comedy with Sam Niell and Laura Dern's characters engaged in some wacky paleontological adventures, complete with comedic sexual tension and requisite end-of-movie wrap-up kiss. Jurassic Park III is not worth seeing.
B000002H6C|5.0|If you are looking for an all around outstanding album, you just found it in ...And Justice for All! This 5th release from Metallica has them crossing over into major Progressive territory, Cliff Burton R.I.P., would have been proud! This album offers so much in the way of metal, AWESOME, MEMORABLE guitar-riffs from Hetfield and Kirk, the drumming is phenomenal and had a MAJOR influence on the way I play today,&lt; Yep, you guessed it I'm a drummer.&gt; The funny part about this album is the bass is pretty much nonexistent but makes no impact on the greatness of this album what-so-ever! Your not thinking bass when you hear this album, TRUST ME, your to busy banging your head against the wall listening to &quot;Eye Of The Beholder&quot; or singing to their classic &quot;One&quot;. 1988 was a good year for me and this album made it BETTER! This album should definetly be playing in your CD &lt;or tape&gt; player tomorrow. Buy it. It's a must have for any true metal-head.
038572179X|3.0|Interesting plot.<BR>It was in 1935, in a country home of a family. Here's Briony, a 13-year old girl, with creative imagination and the talent of writing. The elder siblings are back for the summer. Come the cousins from a troubled family; an enterpreneur guest; and a long-time friend who increasingly seemed to be crazy and scary. Events are cleverly built up to the center of story. It was such a tragedy when Briony's complex messed with the adult world. What a heart-breaking turn of events!<br />Contemplative issue.<BR>How long does it take to atone? What do we have to do to undo our grievous mistakes? We probably carry our guilts to the grave.<br />Elaborate story-telling.<BR>Woaw, in this novel things are elaborated in details. The surrounding, the physical beings, the thoughts. It's too much to my liking tho. I mean, I don't care how dark the sky was when it has nothing to do with the plot. Or maybe it has.<br />If you like to indulge in the beautifully, stupendously crafted descriptions of details, then you would really enjoy this book. Otherwise, you're probably like me. I wish the storyline was faster.. it's too exhaustive transforming the written illustration into the visual imagination, that I had to skip some of the details.

B00003CX59|5.0|&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is without a doubt one of the best pieces of work Tim Burton has contributed to American Cinema. No horror fans should miss it. Burton takes scary movies to a whole new level, weaving his own morsels of fantasy, detail, and mystery into the story.<BR>His movie is based upon Washington Irving's classic tale, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&quot; I cannot go without voicing the undeniable statement that Burton butchers the original story as many times as the the villain, the Headless Horseman, chops off his victims' heads. But that's alright. Irving's story, while considered a classic by some, is too short and too childish to be made into a full-length horror film.<BR>The only thing that stays the same between the book and the movie is the setting, which is the small village of Sleepy Hollow during the late 1790's, and the characters. There is Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York City constable who is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate three murders with his new scientific detection processes. While in Sleepy Hollow, he resides as a guest in the home of Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), the richest and most poular man in the village, now that one of his wealthy relatives is among the three deceased.<BR>Also living in the house is Lady Van Tassel, played wonderfully by Miranda Richardson, and Baltus's beautiful daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci).<BR>It is not very long before Ichabod realizes mysterious things about Sleepy Hollow, which all happen to be Burton's superb additions to the story, my favorite of which being the Tree of the Dead, which has vibrantly red blood in place of sap. He also notices Katrina's secret practice of magic, which he is accustomed to because of past events revolving around his mother and father. He also begins to realize, with us by his side, that the things the town has told him about the Headless Horseman are true, and that another villain, with much more power than the Horseman, could be lurking amonst the villagers.<BR>I do have to mention the gore factor in this movie. The second time I saw it, I numbered the body count, and I found about 18 deaths, not counting a flashback centering around a war-like situation in which others are killed but are shadowed or hidden behind other people. Out of those 18 deaths, 15 of them resulted in beheading, and we either see the heads being chopped off, rolling away, or the inside of the person's neck for 13 or 14 of those characters. However, if you do not like gore, you can still watch. I'm not trying to be inhumane, but the simple fact runs that once you see the first two decapitations, you get used to the sight and it doesn't bother you anymore after that.The gore isn't there to scare like it is in most films; it's only there because it has to be.<BR>If you ever get an opportunity to watch this movie, make sure you do so. Better yet, buy it. It is definitely worth your time and money. Even if you don't like scary movies, close your eyes when you want and watch the rest just to see the beautiful scenery, because this is the most gorgeous eye-candy to be made yet. It is one of my favorite horror films, even better that &quot;Rosemary's Baby,&quot; &quot;Final Destination,&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist.&quot;<BR>You will not be disapointed.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is the most haunting, catchy, Sabbath album there is! I remember the first time I heard this album. I skipped school and a buddy let me borrow this, I was at the house by myself, and remember this album gave me the CREEPS! I turned all the lights on in the house! Welcome to the world of Black Sabbath's Sabotage. Ozzy wails away like an insane banshee while metal-godfather, riff-master Iommi kicks off heavy&lt;for the time&gt; and catchy riffs, Ward's tribal pounding and Geezers thick bass make for a perfect back-drop. I LOVE this album when I'm in a somber mood. This album has everything a metal fan could want. 5 stars without a doubt. You must own it.

The main character, the autistic boy was really powerful, and after reading this book i really felt as if my own perception of the world had changed, from looking at the world through this young persons eyes.<BR>The story line is straightforward but draws you in, and is full of raw emotion, honesty, and realism, of life in todays society.<BR>Don't miss out, it's a top read.
0060934719|4.0|In the ever growing genre of Urban Fantasy, _Stardust_ stands out as a rare gem among the cluttered and convulted and all too often poorly done novels of that genre.<br />But what makes this novel stand out is it's premise and ultimate story and it's story telling that may also be it's partial downfall.<br />_Stardust_ is about a man named Tristan Thorn living in early-Victorian era England in the village of wall. A village that stands out purely because of it's massive wall that blocks off the village in one direction. In the village of Wall there is a large man sized hole that is guarded day and night. No one is ever let through except every nine years on a special holiday. The reason for this odd schedule? It's belived that the hole in the wall leads to the Fairy World.<br />When a star falls from the sky on the otherside of the wall, Tristan makes a vow to retrieve that star to win the hand of his beloved and so begins a fairy tale like journey that is riddled with original ideas and old mythologies presented in an original way.<br />Gaiman's prose is often considered childlike and poetic at the same time. It's written to be told as a new fairy tale and in some sense it is, yet it is this very archaeic approach in a time when more modern methods and sensibilities and morals are praised in fantasy. _Stardust_'s lead character Tristan is an innocent and naiive and sweet youngman with perhaps a predictable destiny and ties to the land beyond the wall and it's inhabitants, yet it is this very characteristic that both endures him to us and makes us sigh quietly with the cliche of it all. One can SEE the &quot;revealtion&quot; towards the end of this book a mile away. As most fairy tales had this same charactertistic it makes the story a well done fairy tale with all that is required of it. But it may not make it enduring to it's more modern minded readers.<br />_Stardust_ is filled with secondary characters that are introduced in various narratives then later abandonded rather sadly in quick &quot;get 'em out of the way&quot; means, that is perhaps this books only real downfall. With a predictable and happy ending and slightly over extended epilogue and slow prologue this book is sweet fairy tale that stands out in its rariety and also makes it forgettable to some readers.<br />It's hard for me to give Neil Gaiman a less then perfect review, but this being one of his earliest novels, it's easy to see the clutter of a writer still in the earliest phases of developing his own niche with writing that was more clearly and solidly finished _American Gods_ then it is in this novel.onded rather sadly in quick &quot;get 'em out of the way&quot; means, that is perhaps this books only real downfall.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I've waited to review this album until all three soundtracks to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy have been released. Each soundtrack is better than the one before it, but all three are incredible, five-star albums. They are assembled on CD to create the best listening experience possible, conveying massive scores in seventy-minute packages that stand on their own as great achievements in orchestral/choral music. Lovers of film music, fantasy, and orchestral concert music will want to own all three CDs, and the best place to start is right here, at the beginning of the journey. Howard Shore perfectly captured Tolkien's Middle-Earth with his music in this opening chapter, and it gave him a great foundation on which to build two even better scores.<br />The \\"Fellowship\\" album is the most linear and straightforward of the three. The tracks follow the strict order of the story, and there is no combining of pieces from different parts of the film into single tracks as would happen on the next two albums. I first heard the soundtrack before the film was released (I ran out and purchased it the morning it hit stores), and was able to effortlessly follow the action of the film based on the music. It is the easiest of the score to \\"get into\\" quickly, since it gradually introduces you into the major themes, even if it doesn't reach the majestic heights of the next two albums.<br />\\"Fellowship\\" has the most variety of the scores, however, shifting between sprightly folk and dance tunes for the hobbits, dark and dreary music for the mines of Moria, two very different types of ethereal music for the Elves of Rivendell and Lotholorien, and evil choral music for the Ringwraiths. In this one album, you already have a great musical perspective on Tolkien's world, and are ready to experience the rest of the journey in \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King.\\"<br />The opening track, \\"The Prophecy,\\" isn't actually in the film (the prologue of the movie was constantly changingright up to the release date, so this is probably an early version of the opening credits), but serves as a great entry into the album with its gradually rising power through the chorus, and hints of the \\"Shire Theme\\" at the end. The major theme of the score (and of the whole trilogy) is the \\"Fellowship Theme,\\" which makes its heroic appearance at the end of \\"The Council of Elrond\\" and expands into its fullest expression in \\"The Ring Goes South,\\" the musical mid-point of the album. It also serves as the sad, mournful ending to the action cue, \\"Amon Hen\\" (the sword battle on the hill and Boromir's last stand). The other major theme is the \\"Shire Theme\\" a gentle melody for Frodo and his hobbit companions heard at the end of the folksy second track, \\"Concerning Hobbits,\\" which then blooms in the beautiful track \\"Many Meetings\\" and is the basis for the lengthy ending piece, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\"<br />The action cues are furious and often frightening. The choral theme for the Ringwraiths dominates the first half of the album, climaxing in the tremendous \\"Flight to the Ford.\\" Gandalf's defeat at the hands of Saruman in \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" also receives a full-assault choral interpretation. \\"Amon Hen\\" shows Shore's skill at creating tension by gradually building the music without resolving it; it is a technique that really wrings you out emotionally with action music, a very tough thing to achieve. The best track of all is \\"The Bridge of Khazad-dum,\\" a remarkable piece of dark, desperate action as the fellowship tries to escape from the mines and faces the Balrog (the solo voice conclusion to this track is one of saddest moments in all of the scores).<br />The album also has the largest amount of purely \\"Elven\\" music of the albums. For Rivendell, Shore composes an uplifting, airy theme, and for Lothlorien, he takes a more eerie, other-wordly approach. It shows Shore's deep understanding of Tolkien's world.<br />Enya's two pieces, \\"Aniron\\" and \\"May it Be\\"fit in well with the gentle, Elvish musical tone of the score, but compared to later end title songs from \\"Towers\\" and \\"Return of the King,\\" they seem a bit sleepy and slow. Still, Enya was a good choice for the film, and \\"Aniron\\" does feel as if Elves could have actually written it.<br />The only problem with this soundtrack album -- and all the albums have this same flaw -- is that there is so much music in the film that only about a third can fit here. As great a listening experience as this album is, it would be nice to have an expanded two-disc version some time in the near future. (Certainly, it would sell tons of copies, so Sony Music should really get on this project right away!)
0553801546|5.0|This is by far one of the best and most satisfying novels (of any genre) I have ever read!  I have read scores of fantasy novels and I can't say enough about this beautiful and intricate storyline.  Robin Hobb has done a masterful job in continuing the story of FitzChivalry Farseer.<br />Never have I had an author take me through so many clearly drawn emotions.  Trilogy endings rarely live up to their predecessors. . . this one does.  You do need to read the first two books, and preferably, the entire first trilogy as well.  This is the only way to fully capture the story being drawn.  These are characters who will live forever to me.  I can't recommend this novel strongly enough!  This is what storytelling should be.
B000063DFS|4.0|My Opinion: First off this album is WAY overrated. It's good, but it's no where as good as it's made out to be. I've had people say the only songs of Ozzy's they knew were Mama I'm Comin Home and Crazy Train, and that's sad. If you want GOOD Ozz stuff try out Bark at the Moon, No Rest For The Wicked, and anything he did in Sabbath. On to the review<br />1.Mr. Tinkertrain-really good song. Good vocal usage. This is probably my second favorite song on here (tied with No More Tears). 9/10<BR>2.I Don't Want To Change The World-best song on the album.10/10<BR>3.Mama, I'm Coming Home-good song, but nowhere near the first 2 and the title track.<BR>4.Desire-it's a good song, with a really catchy chorus. 8/10<BR>5.No More Tears-tied with the 1st track for my second favorite song on the album. It's got a creepy meaning behind it. It's about a serial killer. 10/10<BR>6.S.I.N-pretty good song with good guitar work 7/10<BR>7.Hellraiser-3rd best song on the album. This song is also on a Motorhead album, but I don't remember which one. 7/10<BR>8.Time After Time-good song, but almost identical to Road To Nowhere in music. Shouldn't have been on the Essential, thats' for sure 6/10<BR>9.Zombie Stomb-cool bass line, but other than that, this is a stupid song. 5/10<BR>10.A.V.H-GREAT guitar at the start. It's gotta southern edge to it. It's cool 7/10<BR>11.Road To Nowhere-overrated song, but it's ok. 8/10<BR>12.Don't Blame Me-cool song. Basically a generic rocker, but it's a decent song. 8/10<BR>13.Party With The Animals-good song with catchy music. 8/10<br />Overall: This is no Black Sabbath Volume 4 or No Rest For The Wicked, but it's an okay release, it's just REALLY overrated. Try out anything with Ozzy in Sabbath, NRftW, Bark at the Moon, Ozzmosis, The Ultimate Sin, and DEFINATELY Speak of the Devil, they are all better
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham is back with an engrossing story of 1970's era Clanton, Mississipi.  Willie Traynor is the narrator for this novel in which he buys the local newspaper at the young age of 23 and through this position witnesses all the ups and downs of the town for a decade.<br />When a local woman is raped and murdered, Danny Padgitt is put on trial and convicted.  Padgitt, related to a family of thieves and crooks, threatens the jury.  Padgitt is sentenced to life instead of the death penalty, and is paroled in ten years.  You learn this much by reading the summary of the book.<br />Grisham then spends much time bringing the town of Clanton to life while slowly moving the plot along.  Traynor befriends an elderly black woman named Callie Ruffin and often hangs out with Harry Rex Vonner.  Traynor visits every church in the county and joins the fight in Walmart type stores invading small towns.<br />While Traynor is the narrator of the story, I never got involved much with his character.  While he is a reporter, he sees almost everything, he never really does much.  I think Grisham intended Traynor to be the eyes through which we view this small town and all its charms.  The plot moves along too slowly at times, but when it does pick up at the end, you feel like you know everything there is to know about the town and its people.<br />Grisham is still one of the best out there.  This novel is long and somewhat complex (especially when compared to some other efforts like the Summons.)  I enjoyed this amusing and entertaining look at small town life and all of its crazy characters.  I recommend this Grisham book to anyone.
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all to all the people who rate this album below 5 stars where it should be becuase it really is a masterpiece, this is some of the best rock music you will hear hear and cant be compared to anything else becuase it like nothing else youve ever heard before and all you people who claim to know what good rock is need to open your ears for longer than two seconds and listen to this with an open non biased mind so you too can realize what youve been missing. With that being said this is one of my favorite cd's in my collection its just one of those cd's you can put in and relax and float of to another world without skipping a single track. If you like any kind of hard rock at all its a sin to not have this cd.
B00005JMCN|2.0|Seabiscuit is an acclaimed movie that runs for well over two hours, yet I found myself bored and waiting to see what was so great about this movie.<br />This movie tells the story of Seabiscuit, its trainer, owner and jockey.  The movie opens by showing snippets of a young Tobey McGuire at home with his family and Jeff Bridges making a fortune selling cars.  It shows Chris Cooper on the farm training horses.  This movie jumps from scene to scene at an incredible pace from the beginning of the movie to the end.<br />The editing seems choppy and the story is fragmented.  To enjoy this movie, every single scene needed to be about 10 seconds longer.  The director cut every scene short, making them just long enough to tell the viewers how they should feel.<br />At the very beginning of the movie, Jeff Bridges sees his son reading a book.  He asks him if he wants to go outside and play.  The son says no, then the scene cuts to the dad leaving town without the son.  There is no explanation why or who is even watching the kid.  The next scene shows the kid getting in a truck to go fishing.  The next scene shows the kid dead and the dad crying.<br />The whole movie is like this.  There is no character development because there isn't time.  If you watch this movie, check out the scene where it is revealed Toby McGuire is blind.  That could have been longer and explained more, but it is cut short and left me wondering what's going on?<br />I guess this movie would have needed another hour to give the subject matter justice, but as it stands, the director did a horrible job of telling a great story.  This movie deserves none of the accolades it is getting.
B00006879E|4.0|What a breath of fresh air Maroon 5 are! They have taken so many different genres and rolled them into a spectacular, original CD. Each song is in the same vein however each is different in it's own right. They take rock, funk, jazz and even lounge-y keyboard music and roll it up into a great album. I love this because it is all the things that have been used a million times before on individual albums, but not on one album by one band. I think that Maroon 5 are very deserving of all the attention and airplay they are getting. Mainly because they are so different than all the other cookie-cutter bands and artists whose music sounds like it was factory produced and formulaic. This album is definitely a love it or hate it kind of CD but if you are tired of all the unoriginal, uninspired bands and artists out there, then give this CD a try. Some standout tracks: Harder to Breathe, This Love, Shiver, She Will Be Loved, Tangled and Must Get Out.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This might not be the best movie ever made; the action scenes were confused, it was drawn-out, and the storyline certainly had flaws. But this movie was the first take on the event at Pearl Harbor that really hit home. I suddenly understood as I watched the movie that THIS REALLY HAPPENED, these people did die trapped underwater, they did go on this suicide mission, this is how things were. So I forgive Pearl Harbor for its flaws and recommend it. I especially liked how the movie showed the Japanese point of view; too many portrayals of war depict the US as the saintly power and other countries as jealous demons attempting to dethrone us.<br />This is a good movie for a rainy day with a few (at least 3 and a half) empty hours and a box of tissues.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I loved At The Drive-In. Catchy songs with good hooks is what they played. It was horrible when they broke up.<br />Anyway, i had doubts about The Mars Volta. When i heard they were a more technical, complex spaced-out version of ATDI, i didnt think much of it. But when i got the album, i found out why everyone was hyping them up so much. Its because they are simply amazing. Intricate guitar work with incredibly beautiful melodies and epic drumming, combined with vocals that are as passionate as they come. <br />There is not a person that i know that can deny their talent, even people who arent fans of the genre. I doubt there is a single person in America who can say they truely do not find something breathtaking in at least one aspect of the bands musicianship. This band put forth the best album of 2003.
B000068QY7|4.0|so after two pretty lackluster albums and quite a few break-ups and new members to the band.  this album shows the creative and impressive side to this band.  how can you really not love &quot;stop crying your heart out&quot; and even though songbird and born on a different cloud, are very (VERY) beatlesque, so what!!!  still better than 90% of music coming out of the us.  who wants another creed, limp bizkit, or puddle of mudd?? not this guy!  I would also throw in nickleback if they weren't canadian.  but back to oasis.  great cd, much better cohesion.  the disc actually flows, which really only can be said about what's the story.  so buy the disc, even if you don't like the bragging gallagher bros., they can sure write/sing a good tune or two...
B0001AP12G|5.0|i must say college dropout is one of the best cds i have heard in a long while. this is the actually the only cd that i did not need to use the skip button on my cd player in a long while. the songs in this cd are very soulful and the rhymes are so original. kanye has definately done it again!!!! my best songs on this cd is spaceship, it has great production and all and jesus walks is just da bomb!!! kanye should have never put the new workout plan in his cd. this song made me not give this cd a 5.5, in conclusion anybody that doesnt get this cd is definately sleeping cause hip hop is back and stronger than ever!!! thanks KANYE!!!
B00009ATIX|2.0|This movie carries has a lot of really heavy themes swimming around in an ill-defined soup.  It never really decides which ones it wants to focus on.  <BR>I think the most interesting ones are about control and culpability in relationships.  Kelvin feels responsible for his wife's suicide, so when she reappears he is less concerned with her as a person than he is in making sure he never loses her again.  When it is clear that she is unhappy, it matters very little to him; he will guard the door to make sure she does not get away from him again.  He cannot love her because he is too busy trying to keep her.  <BR>There are also some interesting moments about how we remember people vs. how they really are, and I was intrigued by Gordon's fear and desire to do the right thing at all costs, but these themes remain undeveloped -- as does most of the movie.  I haven't read the book or seen the 70's Russian version, but I've got to say that despite so much potential, the actual movie mostly fails.
B00006JSGQ|5.0|This record is the very definition of sublime..  In a desert of musical nothingness, it is a lush oasis of talent, skill and passion.  From lighthearted (Coyote) to touching (Hill Farmer's Blues) to heart-wrenching (Ragpicker's Dream) it is such as to make a cynical man tremble and weep.  My only regret about this album is not purchashing it sooner.  The second CD is not to be missed either.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This CD is breath of fresh air for hip-hop.  The thing I like about this cat is his originality.  He might not be the tightest lyricist in the world, but he's definitely above average.  Of course, we all know how nice he is behind the boards.  I would've gave it five stars, but I hate skits (I liked the Bernie Mac skits though).  Next time, just let the songs flow in sequence.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|This latest album from Enigma is dissapointing in every way. None of these tracks contains the enchanting gregorian chorus that we used to hear in other albums and which, in my opinion, gives the spiritual richness to Cretu's compositions. In addition, we can't find any song like &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot; , &quot;I Love You, I'll Kill You&quot; or &quot;Why?&quot; which makes us discover the dephts with their beautiful melodies and moving rhytms... What's left is a superficiel music that doesn't satisfy our expectations from Enigma...
B0000AQVCL|5.0|There are very few bands like Jet, it isn't your pretty boy manufactured band that we are used to seeing debut. Every song is catchy and you can hear the Beetles and AC/DC influence. It's good to hear that back to basic - kick ass - high energy great music again. You don't realize what you've missed until you hear Get Born. It is a must buy, must hear album. An instant fan.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Lost in Translation is a character study without insight, a mood piece that leaves you cold.  The chic photographic stills and its synopsis convey as much about the ideas Sofia Coppola possesses.  From its compositions to its pseudo-searching hangdog countenances of its stars, this is not a film, but an advertisement of hipness.  <br />The core relationship between unlikely movie star, Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson) is unbelievable and vapid.  Their hotel-bar interactions consist of him making a lame wisecrack and her giggling uncontrollably.  Both actors have charisma, and especially in the later scenes, there's a superficial chemistry between the two that is heightened by some hiply evocative electronica, but the dialogue is sparse and Coppola's compositions are too wispy and indirect.  So where is the profundity that cuts through their supposedly banal surroundings? <br />Much has been made of the fact that Charlotte and Bob don't sleep together, as if that fact warrants praise on its own.  But their connection is so facile that the lure of sex is hardly palpable...There is not hunger between them, intellectual or otherwise.  That they don't have sex is not indicative of some great directorial \\"restraint\\" because we as viewers never genuinely want them to.  <br />There wasn't a discernible narrative, and ideas/characters/locations/themes floated around with as much fluidity as the movie's amorphous camera.  This is hardly a critcism though.  Movies that rely purely on mood and the intuitive senses of the viewer can be spectacular (the oeuvre of David Lynch for example) but, in addition to foregoing intellectual austerity, the film possesses so little genuine emotion that it fails to arouse any immediate rush of entertainment.  The conceptually intriguing thought of roaming around Tokyo with Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson is surprisingly dull, and Coppola has no gift for emotional headrush.  The scenes of them goofing around Tokyo (and howoften they are) are hardly cinematic, and seem like an amateurish bad music video.  It's neither thought-provoking nor much fun. <br />Despite its anti-glamor, anti-banality message, the film enabled the very superficiality that it preached against.  Everything from Charlotte's Yale degree in philosophy to Bill Murray's cool whiskey ads seem relentlessly, self-consciously hip. The movie dabbles in outcast ideology yet deifies its characters' exterior traits without ever delving into the true flaws and personality quirks that make them so searching and dissatisfied with their lives.  All the scenes of the characters sopping in their own tragic prettiness could have been substituted for heartfelt introspection.  Yet they aren't.<br />The Virgin Suicides is a good if flawed first film, and Sofia Coppola is still young.  But so are a lot of other directors who are making brilliant movies.  Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Kimberly Peirce, Richard Kelly, even her ex-husband, Spike Jonze have each created films that put this slinky effort to shame.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I saw Gavin live, bought the cd on the spot and havent stopped listening to it since. His songs are moving and he is so talented, I recommend this album to everyone :)
0451191153|5.0|I have read this book three times.  I read regularly, and I value this book above all others.  When I read any part or page or paragraph of this book I immediately experience a certain kind of joy that is expressed very, very beautifully in the Fountainhead.  Every word that drips from the pages into my mind surges with life!  That is the focus of my praise for this book:  As a work of art.  I find it incomprehensible how anyone could fail to appreciate this, even if they disagree completely with Ayn Rand's philosophical views.  In response to the reviewers that have found distaste for this book, I offer the cautionary account that I, when I first read this book, could make almost no sense out of it at all.  I deduced that philosophically it was very pro-individualism, and this I liked, but beyond that my insight saw no further.  I tasted the individualism, and more I didn't even realize I was tasting, and I came back to this book twice more. Since then I have matured and learned so much more about what it means to be alive, and in The Fountainhead I see a philosophical monolith both structured and woven with brilliant metaphors and an artistry of the english language rarely found.  <br />Ayn Rand was a bitter genius who saw into a part of reality deeper than anyone had previously done, and for this she was condemned?  I embrace this fact fully, but I want to cast it away!  Is bitterness unforgiveable?  Is insight immoral?  Anyone who is unable to find value in this book has never known for the most fleeting moment what it means to be alive!  <br />Feeling unqualified satisfaction with what I have just said, I want to add that I do not agree completely with Ayn Rand's philosophical ideas.  But that is not important.  What is important is that the book presents her philosophical ideas as elegantly and as powerfully as a fiction novel is capable of achieving. <br />If you have any sense whatsoever that on occasion it is a noble thing for a human being to go to a secluded corner of the Universe and  think for himself or herself, absent any regard to what others have thought before, and to enjoy this, and to use this thinking to change things, to create, then the totality of Ayn Rand's faults will seem trivial as this book causes you to exist more than you had existed before.
B00013PHGS|4.0|I have been a big fan of Air since I found Moon Safari, which became one of my favorite albums ever.  Virgin Suicides was different from Moon Safari, but it was great.  Then they released 10,000 Hz Legend.  Ugh.  I was so disappointed by that album.  There was barely a song I enjoyed.  <br />So I listened to Talkie Walkie with some trepidation.  I was worried for nothing.  Talkie Walkie is brilliant.  Some of the songs, particularly Cherry Blossom Girl, sound like they came from Moon Safari, while some of the other songs, especially Run, sound more like the Virgin Suicides soundtrack.  <br />One of the things I liked about Moon Safari was how it made me feel.  Their music has this strange etheral quality.  Sometimes it reminds of a 70's version of futurism.  Air makes me feel like I have been transported to a different time and place.  Talkie Walkie has that same quality.  I'm sure we'll be hearing a lot of this album in Starbucks and Banana Republics.  <br />I believe the first 6 songs are much stronger than the last 4. Alpha Beta Gaga is pretty good.  Biological is the worst of the bunch.  <br />On the whole I am very happy that Air returned to form.  If you like their earlier work, buy this CD.   I gave this 4 stars because there are some weaker songs on the album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ive been waiting for this to drop for more than a minute, and its well hot! He can produce, he can rap, he has punchlines like nobodies business (she's got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson / she's got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson). <BR>     There were many advanced copies available due to Kanye working on this project for over 2 years, there were many songs that were overplayed before the album hit the shelves so he delivered fresh material. I can't to see if he drops The New Workout Plan as a single, he's gotta go for sum Eddie Murphy in the women's aerobics class style in the Nutty Professor movie. Standout tracks would have to be the club ready New Workout Plan, the soulful storytelling of Spaceship, the heartfelt Never Let Me Down and the genius wordplay of Two Words. The last track Last Call was very intellegent to have done seeing as not many know who Kanye is so he gives us a bit of a autobiography. <BR>     The only downfalls would be the number of skits, even if they do relate to the following track, they spoil the flow of the album on occasions. Also hearing Ludacris only spit on a chorus leaves your mouth watering for a verse.<BR>     All that aside, Jay-Z said a month ago someone will come along and Ma$e the game, and thats what Kanye has done, flipped the whole gun bangin gangsta rap scene on its head and brought it back to the essence.<BR>     COP THIS<br />     Dizzy
B0000657UB|5.0|Fairport Convention's last album with Sandy Denny, \\"Liege & Lief\\", stripped away the sound of their previous two albums [[ASIN:B00007J36W What We Did On Our Holidays]] and [[ASIN:B00007J36V Unhalfbricking]] to produce a fusion of traditional singing and rock instrumentation that can only be described as amazing.<br /><br />The driving opener \\"Come All Ye\\", though the only original song on the record, was a piece so moving it really will shatter the mind: one feels the instruments blending in the most incredible manner to produce a groove possessing truly searing emotion. The third track, \\"Matty Groves\\" was maybe even better, with the tale of an woman accused of infidelity telling more over its eight minutes than most albums manage in sixty. Ashley Hutchings' basslines and Richard Thompson's guitar work burn with a sensuality rivalling the best of Kate Bush's [[ASIN:B00004R7TP Hounds Of Love]]. Hutchings in particular benefits from the solid, stripped-down sound, whilst Sandy Denny's pure voice tells everything as it is, especially on the line \\"I'd rather one kiss from dead Matty's lips/Than you or your finery\\".<br /><br />The rest of \\"Liege & Lief\\" was not half so brilliant, but mainly less accessible, notably the especially dark, beautiful and uninviting \\"Tam Lin\\" (the tale of a disobedient youngster) and the beautiful, slow \\"The Quiet Joys Of Brotherhood.\\" Even on the medley of \\"The Lark In The Morning\\", \\"Rakish Paddy\\", \\"Foxhunter's Jig\\" and \\"Toss The Feathers\\" the sound remained dark but the startlingly melodic fiddle playing of Dave Swarbrick still craved attention. \\"The Deserter\\" (about a disobedient soldier) had a truly hymn-like character that served to reflect the injustice of England's early criminal justice system - along with Sandy's most emotional vocal, notably during the crescendo late in the song. \\"Reynardine\\" - though a superior version can be found on Anne Briggs' [[ASIN:B00000J80K A Collection]] - was also dramatic if almost too slow.<br /><br />On the whole, \\"Liege & Lief\\" must be seen as a landmark work that still possesses immense power and beauty.

0671027344|5.0|Set in 1991, Charlie is not a geek, but by no means the popular freshman in high school either. After his friends suicide in the summer, Charlie enters freshman year as a no name face, until he meets seniors Sam and Patrick. He is then exposed to drugs, sexuality, first love, as well as discovering himself along the way. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower transfers readers to the mind of a coming-of-age teenage boy. Through his experiences, turmoil, and frustrations, Charlie brings you back to the roller coaster, unforgettable days known as- adolescence. <br />Throughout the book, Charlies acquaintances are documented through his letters to an anonymous receiver. We know no more than the date and the characters name, which expands the area of flexibility for us to connect to him. Chbosky doesnt dress the book with fancy word structures; instead he conveys the thinking of a 15 year-old into simple writings. While we watch Charlie grasps to feel infinite? our own views of the world has been affected and grown with his. <br />'He's something, isn't he?\\"<BR>Bob nodded his head. Patrick then said something I don't think I'll ever forget.<BR>'He's a wallflower.'<BR>'You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.'<br />Seeing life as a dance floor, Charlie is the wallflower by the books title. His observant and curious characteristic led him through amazing self realizations. This is more than a clich?fiction novel; Chbosky does a wonderful job of relating readers to the book because Charlies confusions are extremely realistic. Reading Charlie through his teenage journey, Ive learned to feel the world around me just as he does. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is one of the rare writings thatd make you laugh and cry at the same time, and realizing something new every time you reread it.
B00003CXCW|4.0|In the period of time know as the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of the movies were carried by the performances and the scripts, computer generated special effects were unavailable, so when you see a movie from this period of time, you know that is going to be a showcase for the actors and directors. I wish that more films like \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" were made in these days, but this is the era of the big blockbusters and movie franchises.<br />\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is a film packed with fascinating and very complex characters, who can ever forget the former diva and walking contradiction Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), the opportunistic Joe Gillis (William Holden) or the mysterious butler Max Von Mayerling?<br />The situations in the story are always interesting, thanks to the great script \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" has both comedy and drama. \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" has several unforgettable scenes, from the opening scene where we can see one of the main characters already dead, to the final scene where we can see that one of the characters has finally lost it (by the way, the scene of the funeral for the death monkey is one of the most original scenes I have ever seen).<br />For these reasons and many more \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is a classic that must be seen by anyone that considers himself / herself a movie buff.
0684803356|5.0|Remarkable. This is a truthful and captivating tale of the Spanish Civil War (The republic against fascists) Hemingway, chose to center the story around a guerrilla group fighting behind enemy lines, as well an American dynamiter, Robert Jordan, who joins forces to take up a mission that may cost their lives. The story is set up straight away as Robert Jordan is introduced to each of the members of the small guerilla band(under 10 members), then the plot slows down a bit when the initial planning of the mission is taking place. <br />Complications in this mission weave the plot: from a dreaded conspiracy and sell-out, to an unexpected romance. Robert Jordan is caught in many dilemmas, as he falls in love with a girl during his time with the guerrilla group, and now he faces the fear of dying and leaving someone that he loves behind. Jordan¡¦s internal monologue in this book does wonders in his contemplation of what is right and wrong, and trying to figure out what is important: duty against love, the cause of the Republic against the lives of the partisans--the very people that he had become close friends with. I think all this builds up the suspense and the fear for what may become of the characters.  <br />There are quick shifts between past and present in this long novel that actually only spans a mere three days. Flashbacks of Robert Jordan¡¦s grandfather and father, tells us a lot about his character and the reason that he fights in this war. And stories of each of the characters past, brings us closer to understanding each of the band members.  <BR>The horrible story by the woman Pilar shows us that there is no such thing as ¡§the good side¡¨ or ¡§the bad side¡¨ in war; war itself is evil. The morality of war is also briefly discussed, along with an old man¡¦s fears of taking the life of another. Then of course there is the general question that is on the minds of all the characters: When will this all end?<br />What I especially like about thisbook is its unique and brilliant dialogue. Hemingway directly translates Spanish into English, resulting in an awkward, but strangely realistic speech, providing fuel for the story¡¦s atmosphere.<br />And all this leads to the explosive climax, with El Sordo¡¦s last stand, the blowing of the bridge, and the attempt to escape. It is brilliantly descriptive, and has a well set-up plot that will make you pray for the characters to come out of it alive. The suspense is unbearable. This book is definitely a page-turner and perhaps one of Hemingway¡¦s best works after The Sun Also Rises.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|It's a shame, really.  The foundation concepts of 2003's *Underworld*, on the page at least, indicate a genuine neo-Victorian epic.  In brief: a blood-feud war between vampires and werewolves; the viral strains of these outcasts and the possible intermingling of abomination-breeds; the historical elements detailing the cause of the conflict: although not exactly new or original, the alchemic combination of these ideas suggest vast potential, and practically beg for an expert treatment such as that given the recent blockbuster phenomenon of Lord of the Rings.  Alas, this film comes off rather a harrowing example of squandered opportunities and inept direction, the dismal end-result of rigorous conformity to the ethic of 'style over substance.' <br />A breakdown of the major faults:<br />STORY: The core concepts are modern-era mythic (always a plus) and brim with melodramatic possibility, but the actual script execution is muddled and/or obtuse, structural information delivered either too sparsely or without the necessary passion; the dialogue flat, unoriginal and uninspired, and so, so deathly serious.  The Vampires come off as lethargic [perhaps the result of conqueror's indolence?] weaklings [inexcusable for supposed 'immortals'] who have to rely on gunplay to dispatch their enemies - all in all a nice excuse to ape the Matrix to the hilt.<br />DIRECTION/CINIMATOGRAPHY: Technically, this film is a murky mess, with all the usual suspects included: MTV editing, sloppy framing and the occasionally horrid angle-confusion, an enormous overuse of digital grading.  Nearly the entire film is colored in nighttime blue, which becomes increasingly dull and stullifying as the story grinds towards its predictable peak (at least the Wachoski Bros. are aware of the power of contrasting colors); when coupled with the aggrandizing camera shots, the excess of shadow, the choppy editing to 'excite' (and hide), alongside some laughable moments of CGI, Underworld is a textbook exampleof how to attempt an epic via style over substance - and ultimately fail in engaging the participant.  <br />ACTION: Blood-pumping? Nail-biting? Jaw-dropping? Sorry, none of the above.  I couldn't help but play \\"spot the influence\\" to overcome the threatening sleep-tides of ennui.  A snippy smattering of the famous action sequences Underworld blatantly rips off: The Matrix (obvious), The Matrix Reloaded (Trinity bullet-time flip), Terminator 2 (chase scene), X-Men 1 (Beckinsale's inexplicable swoon/car crash), Equilibrium (face slide), Blade 2 (final showdown).  And even when the film is not engaging in full-blown celluloid plagiarism, the action sequences suffer from weak pacing, poor editing and some absolute incompetence regarding weaponry and combat-tactics.  The scene where a nameless vamp takes on a lycin with two bullwhips is a prominent example.  Instead of using the whips to debilitate his foe (uprooting a leg, dislocation of an arm, spinning the whip around the neck to choke or at least attempt dominance of), the vamp simply swings both whips around in an impressive but ultimately futile grandstanding display of practice-strokes, and pays the price accordingly.  It looks cool, but fails to elect any sort of tension or violent 'rush' -again, style over substance.<br />ACTING: Some actors/actresses are able to overcome the shoddy character-building or trite dialogue of a mediocre script by way of sheer charisma or craft-experience.  Kate Beckinsale, reported to be a talented actress, is not one of those rare paragons of dramatic impersonation.  There's little required for Beckinsale other than the twin stoic reliance of serious/slightly pouty; she isn't given the time or dialogue to sell her tragic past, and the chemistry between her and Speedman is nearly non-existent.  Her character is essentially her leather outfit, cute bob haircut, and twin firepower skills - in other words, style over substance.  Scott Speedman's doctor/lychin, meanwhile, remains passive throughout, thrown into one situation after another like any stereo-archetypical \\"chosen one\\", a rote mold made all the more boring by the Matrix Reloaded's expert deconstruction of the savior/slave role.  The fellow who plays Victor chews the scenery with gusto and adds a much-welcome dollop of humor to this bleak affair, while 'Kraven' tries to do the same and his howlingly-bad performance jars the viewing experience.    <br />I always give credit where credit is due: the film looks marvelous given its relatively measly budget of $23 million, and several of the core concepts were initially promising.  The potential was there.  But the astonishingly poor execution from those involved rendered this vampire tale flatline on delivery.  If you must, eat fistfuls of garlic before braving a view of *Underworld* - the subsequent hyper-jolt might actually make this more the sum of its incompetent parts.
0553382179|5.0|Although her website ([...]) contains pretty much all the same information as this book, I found the book to be more intuitively laid out, and much simpler to navigate than the sometimes-cluttered website. <br />But no matter which you decide to use, the system works wonders.  I can't believe the difference that it's made to my home and my life.  I don't have to worry about company dropping in unexpectedly and I haven't run out of clean clothes in months. <br />Try it, it really works...

They are delightful, life-affirming...all those corny words.  The characters restore your faith in the human race, something I at least need these days living as I do in Jerusalem.  These people are the kind of people I hope to be.  They just get through life being kind and loving and caring for people less fortunate than themselves.  Goes to prove that novels don't have to be able sick twisted people to get an audience.
B0000029DD|5.0|It's depressing to discover such beautiful music when you know that's all there will ever be. But I'm grateful for this little piece. So little music actually inspires anymore. You can't say that about Jeff Buckley. Listening to him, it makes you want to play, to write, to create. I think the highest complement to a true music artist is to be called &quot;inspirational.&quot; I would also recommend the band &quot;Ours&quot; to Jeff fans. They are another inspirational group with a phenominal singer with an angelic voice, and a chance to fill that void in our hearts.
0553801546|5.0|It made me - a very macho commie stabber - all sissified. I like the character of the fool and of the assasin. This book brought the trilogy to an awesome conculsion. You know how people say endings are always stupid because they are too simple or too complex or unrealistic? Well, this book made me recosider that. I had closure.<br />I wish the author had more courage to write about what actual fools and assasins do, and not to sissify the book with feelings. But I guess feelings is good once in a while. I'll need to take a bath though.
0920668372|5.0|I found this book lying in my 10-month-old twin grandsons' room, so read it to them at naptime.  They loved it, and when the tears came to my eyes, they both crawled to my lap and cuddled.  My own babies are now 29, 27, and 25 years old, so I bought 3 copies of Love You Forever: one for each of my babies.  I love the emotion this book evokes, but I also love the out-loud readability for my little grandchildren.  I want my children to pass it on.
B0000062GE|5.0|I will begin by saying, this was the very first cd that I ever owned.  Back in 98 this started my record collection.<br />Now onto the cd.  This album is filled with the some of the most deperate, desolate, depressive, sad, lonley, dark and horribly decrepit songs ever to be written.  And they are all wonderfully done.  Songs about hate (On Your Way Down, The Thin I hate) Death (Goodbye, When I'm Dead, Drowning), Lonliness (Darkest Days, You Complete Me, Sometimes it Hurts, Waking up Beside You), Desperation (Everything I Touch, Drugstore, Torn apart)  Then there's How can I hold on, and Save Yourself, and Haunting Me, Which complete one of the sadest albums ever recordered.<br />The style of the music is a hardrock/industrial hybrid.  Don't think NIN with this band, they are a lot different.  And are both good at what they do.  It was unfortunate the Stabbing WEstward had to break up though.<br />It's sort of a suprise that Christopher Hall never actually ended it all.  But perhaps this was the way he delt with it, through his music.  If you are a person close to ht edge thinking about suicide or any of that, stay very far away from this album.  But if you are like me and use this as a tool to help yourslef feel better, relate, and realise that others go through this stuff too, then by all means purchase this prefect album.
B00011RPB0|2.0|While I am a big Bill Murray Fan, and think he is truly under-rated as an actor.  This movie was awful!  We kept waiting for it to pick up, and be funny, but the laughs were few and far between.  Even the outtakes were not funny.  Photography and music was very good, but the story and dialogue was terrible.  What could have been a really funny film showing the difference in Japanese vs. U.S. Culture was just a hodge podge of scenes thrown together to kill 90 minutes.  If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on Cable!
0451526015|4.0|Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian Gray<br />By: Oscar Wilde<br />Reviewed By: Mary Poppins<br />Period: 5<br />Basil Hallward painted a picture of one of his friends, Dorian Gray.  Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful.  Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, wanted to meet Dorian Gray because Basil told Lord Henry a lot of good things about him.  After the picture was finished, Basil gave it to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that would always be young, and the picture would grow old.  Whenever Dorian had a secret, Lord Henry was always the first to know.  Dorian's face never changed in eighteen years.  He looked exactly the same as when he was eighteen.  One day, Dorian took Basil to the attic.  Basil was then the first person to know about the picture being altered.  After Basil saw the picture, Dorian murdered the man by stabbing a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again.  The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell, one of his former friends, get rid of the body, by blackmailing him.  Dorian then decided what he was going to do.  He was going to destroy the picture, and he thought that he was going to be in peace.  He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it.  A cry and a crash were heard.  Sometime later, the coachman and the footman went in through the windows.  On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful.  On the floor, they saw a man that was wrinkled, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage.  They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who it really was.<br />I liked the book because it was fun and interesting at the same time.  This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: \\"...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!\\"  He didn't know that his wish was to come true.  I love when things like that happen!<br />I also disliked the book because in some parts, it just goes on and on about things that I don't understand.  Also, there is too much philosophy in this book.  This is Lord Henry's quote: \\"I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else.  They have wonderfully primitive instincts.  We have emancipated....\\"  The quote still goes on.  I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.<br />My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil because that is too nasty for me.  That is what I hate to hear., it just goes on and on about things that I don't understand.  Also, there is too much philosophy in this book.

B00003CXAW|5.0|I cannot understand why this film has never been recorded on DVD format.<BR>It is one of the most famous films of all time and I'm sure it would be an instant success.<BR>Even more so if it is done in color.
630542845X|5.0|What a movie is right! the story of outcast jeremey/powder is an amazing touching yet creppy story. when his preggant mother carries Jeremy inside her she is stroked by lighting, she gives birth to electricity itself. Jeremy is made of electricity and raised by his grandparents and lives in there basment till he is a teen. when he is taken from his world by a headmistress of a troubled boys school, she finds that he is a most unique being. Jeremy discovers the pain outside of his home, discovers love and  sees the terrible truth about this place he was born into. <BR>The music is beautiful and Powder/Jeremy is really an amazing character! love love this movie! should have one something for anything!! it's just awesome! but i warn some over protective parents about the film... if are afraid to show your children nudity this isn't the best film to show them. there is a scence where powder is naked but the film only cutsa few parts of his body out of the picture I'm just warning that this alittle close to show real nudity in the film....thats all but most of the film is okiedokie for most people! enjoy!
0066620996|4.0|This was a very strong read and provoked quite a bit of thought.  Based on some solid research and with solid market comparisons, \\"Good to Great\\" helps highlight those traits that can make both a company and the people within it great.<br />While I found some of the conclusion to be a bit over-simplified and derived from conventional wisdom, in general the book delivered the goods.  Having just completed \\"First, Break All the Rules\\" (which I HIGHLY recommend) I was prepared to be disappointed with my next book selection.  Instead I thought this matched \\"First...\\" very well in tone and information.<br />If your interest is in learning what points of excellence seem to appear over and over in great companies (and how you might build the same into yours) I would highly recommend \\"Good to Great.\\"
B00005A46T|4.0|Iowa seems to be a little bit crisper and well thought out than their first album.  The first album it seemed like they were trying to do too much at once.  As Far as being satanic goes, I dont think they are satanic at all.  If you listen to the meaning of their lyrics closer you will find the real meanings behind their songs.  If your 555 then Im 666.  Basicly if you are 555 (a popular prefix for mainstream hollywood telephone numbers) then I am 666 (basicly your worst nightmare too tear your hollywood dream world apart).  If you want to find satanic bands out there, you can find plenty I am sure.  (Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Morbid Angel, Brujeria) This music is about raw emotion, usually the things in life that dont go your way.  They have alot of talent and I appreciate the new type of experimental things they try to do.  I am getting tired of listening to all the repetative music and this seems like a nice change of pace.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ive been waiting for this cd for a few months now and the wait was worth it.

B000005ILF|4.0|Another stellar outing for Sting. He's creating a body of work of outstanding quality.<BR>This album, typically neglected, should rise in standing with time.<BR>With this album, Sting brings back the horn section he flirted with back in the era of &quot;Ghost In The Machine&quot;. There are no barn-burners or roof-raisers; in fact the tempo is downright plodding for most of the record.<BR>It doesn't affect it as much as you might think.<BR>The opening salvo of &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot; and &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; amble along with enough melodic prettiness and lyrical inventiveness to keep you from hitting the skip button.<BR>&quot;Let My Soul Be Your Pilot&quot; is a bit of a retread, sorry to say, and it's the one song I liked better before, but less so as time passes.<BR>On the other hand, I feel like an idiot for missing 'I Was Brought To My Senses&quot;! This is another one of Sting's perfect combos of melody, rhythm and grace. &quot;Graceful&quot; is not a word you hear a lot in modern rock music. This song is definitely worth a listen if that description piques your interest. I recently heard this song live, and I scurried back to the album to see what I've missed. Turns out a lot.<BR>&quot;You Still Touch Me&quot; is OK, but the nasal bray is not used to it's best effect here.<BR>The pinnacle of the album is the one-two punch of &quot;I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying&quot; and &quot;All Four Seasons&quot;. The former is one of his best story songs, coupled with a simple countryish backdrop and a great chorus.<BR>&quot;All Four Seasons&quot; has to be a lost Stax/Volt or Motown outtake. It just has to be. I loved this song the first time I heard it. It's a great lazy summer afternoon song.<BR>The rest of the album is OK, but &quot;Lithium Sunset&quot; is a great album closer. Just great. Again, a simple tune performed midtempo without frills, but memorable...and great in concert.<br />Hugely enjoyable.
0553213105|5.0|\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.<br />  In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.<br />Some characters that appear in the book are:<br />  - Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife<br />  - Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age<br />  - Their five daughters:<br />  - Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,<br />  - Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that<br />  - The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.<br />  However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.<br />  Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gaveme an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|First of all, before I rave about this movie I will say that it is a definite chick flick. It is a romantic comedy geared towards females. Not to say that men won't enjoy it, because some will, I'm just saying that it is a chick flick.<br />With that aside, this is like no other movie that I have seen. Intertwining all the different relationship plots was very well done without losing me, or boring me at any point during the movie. I got a bit misty during at least 3 parts of the movie. The acting is wonderful. What more can I say about an all-star cast. Some of the most popular actors of this time are in this movie (i.e. Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman, Kiera Knightly, Colin Firth, etc..). <br />Upon reading an earlier review about the rating of the movie, obviously the movie is rated R for the same reasons other movies in this genre are rated R. I don't think anyone goes into an R rated movie not expecting to see or hear anything that would gain the movie an R rating.<br />Directly after seeing the movie, I got the soundtrack. Some individual said something about the soundtrack and how it's too much pop or something... Let's see... a romantic, feel-good, comedy. Shouldn't it have romantic, feel-good music? There's nothing wrong with that. The soundtrack has as many popular artists as the movie has popular actors. Every song in the movie fits with the mood the director was trying to convey. <br />Anyway, it's a wonderful, unique movie. Every relationship depicted in this movie is special in it's own way. It's emotional. It's lyrical. It's comical. Everything a good movie should be.

B00005QEO2|2.0|The only songs on this album that aren't on Big Ones or O Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits are some live and/or acoustic versions. They only have &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; as live, but don't have the original recordings. They also have a dumb acoustic version of &quot;Livin On The Edge.&quot; No original for that either. People complain that O Yeah! is missing some essential songs such as &quot;Train Kept A Rollin',&quot; well this does not have it either. They have many of their hits, but there is no reason to get this. If you want a greatest hits collection get O Yeah! or Big Ones. If you are looking for live tracks get Classics Live or Live Bootleg. Stay away from this unless you are turned on by the jewel case cover.
0385504209|4.0|To be honest, I'm not much of an avid reader, but one day however one of my friends had this urge to force me into reading this book. After some research I discovered this book had pretty high ratings, and was on many top-selling charts for days. I gave in, and finally got my copy in which I didn't start a few weeks later. However, I was amazed how once I picked this book up I never seemed to put it down again.<br />The book starts with a simple but intriguing murder case of the curator of a museum at night, where nobody knew what had happened. Coincidently, this man was also a member of a secret society named &quot;Priory of Sion&quot; that had existed long ago and consisted many famous characters in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment such as Sir Isaac Newton and Botticelli. With his life nearing an end, he left in the form of a cipher that appears to be a form of ancient coding. Thus this ignites a series of events and clues being discovered in Da Vinci&iexcl;¦s works that would ultimately draw two people to the answer the ancient secret society was seeking.<br />It&iexcl;¦s a simple storyline, and a simple plot. But the character development and the plot twists were so appealing since it wasn&iexcl;¦t completely obvious. I liked the way the author had cliffhanger endings to each chapter in order to further develop the plot. It had added this sense of suspense and curiosity within me to know how the plot will continue to develop and how it will become. What was much more fascinating were, the details throughout the story of various artworks, culture, and individuals. I was surprised to find that all the content in this book about various people and artworks were all true and do exist!<br />However, I have to say that it did become easier to put down this book towards the end. The cliffhangers started to get annoying occasionally and I&iexcl;¦d get tired of reading the next page just to find out the solution to the conflict. Never the less, it&iexcl;¦s a great book for everyone, but do beware that it does have blood and gore in a few areas.but do beware that it does have blood and gore in a few areas.
B00018D44U|1.0|I just had listen to some of the songs on this album and it is all bad.<br />Nora Jones voice isn't as good when she sang &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;<br />Nora Jones won't pull off a Grammy off this album.
B00009W0WM|5.0|An admission: I've never liked &quot;Casablanca.&quot; I'm a huge fan of old movies, but there are better romances out there, and these stars made better films. Still, it's withstood the test of time gone by (excuse the pun), so it's hardly surprising Warner released a special edition.<br />What is surprising is my new appreciation for the film. It looks and sounds wonderful, and features a highly comprehensive package, including two solid commentaries by Rudy Behlmer and Roger Ebert.<br />Disc 2 is splendid, with over ten minutes of deleted footage and alternate takes (sadly, the sound is lost), not to mention studio memos, press materials, photographs, etc. Other highlights include a radio production featuring the stars in their original roles, and two fascinating documentaries: one on the film, the other on the life of Humphrey Bogart. <br />Truthfully, I was blown away by this new release of &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Every serious DVD collector needs it on their shelf.
B00005JKC3|1.0|The Incredible Hulk is very boring. Eventhough it is based in an action packed comic book of the same name, it does not deserve to have the title. For starters, the movie has a very slow moving and boring pace for the first hour, and the movie is 2 and a half hours long! The actors are all wooden, Eric Bana who plays Bruce Banner can't act worth a damn. Jennifer Connely who plays Betty Banner was acted like a Barbie doll and just as life-less. Nick Nolte plays a very annoying and crazy character, who talks onscreen to death, and he looked like a dirty bum to boot.<BR>There were lots of children watching this movie in the theatre I went to, and many of them looked bored and confused. The action sequences were scarce and pointless, not to mention DARK. They should have had more action scenes in the daytime. The point of this movie was just to show off the computer animation. And I admit that the special effects were good, but that alone cannot carry this garbage! I also hated the fact that the hulk's voice sounded like a normal human because they didn't use a voice modulator. Director, Ang Lee is a moron and this is the second time he bored me to death!
B0000CABBW|5.0|First of all, Castle-Hughes is indeed the youngest Best Actress nominee (Tatum O'Neal won a Best Supporting Actress oscar), and it is well deserved.  Her performance is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Many reviewers here have said that her motivation in this film is to become the new tribe leader and her actions are all intended to prove to her grandfather that she is worthy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Pai does not crave power or leadership.  She only wants what all children - what all people - want: love and acceptance.  The power in this film lies with the fact that Pai is humble and selfless, and this is what ultimately leads to her ascendance.  When she sings to the ancestors (the whales) to come to them, she is not doing it to prove she is the leader - she is doing it to help end her grandfather's suffering.  She doesn't care about herself - she just wants her grandfather to be happy.  She also cares about her tribe and its traditions - she is far more interested in Maori history than anyone else her age, perhaps more than anyone other than the tribal elders.  She loves her heritage and her grandfather, and when she sees an opportunity to make a difference she doesn't want to be left out.  She is not driven by a desire to lead.  She only wants to help and to belong, and in so doing she changes the lives of everyone around her.<br />There are so many emotional moments in this film it is impossible to think through them all without getting choked up.  I knew very little about the film going into it and was really blown away by the masterful storytelling by these relatively new filmmakers.  Frankly, I'm surprised this film wasn't nominated for more than just the one nod to Keisha Castle-Hughes.  At the very least it deserved a nom for Adapted Screenplay (RETURN OF THE KING was the Best Film but as an adaptation it was lacking).  I think it deserved a Best Film nom ahead of SEABISCUIT, which I thought was fine but nowhere near as good as this.  Going by the oscars alone WHALE RIDER is certainly an extremely underrated film, and deserves to be seen.  If richly-drawn characters and simple but engaging human dramas are your bag, don't waste the money renting it - this one is a must-own.
0061015725|4.0|I found Prey to be a real page burner. It hooked me from the first few pages until the very last phrase. As scifi goes, the book is not of the caliber of what are in my opinion the greatest works of scifi such as Dune or the Foundation series, but Crighton manages to consistently produce novels that are both scientifically sound and engaging that echo the long gone era of classic science fiction in which science and not magic drove the plots. As forty year devotee of the genre and a faculty member who teaches a course about scifi, I highly recommend it.

0385720920|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk probably will always be remembered by his big hit, \\"The Fight Club\\".  So, I am sure everyone will be reading his books now after watching the film and expecting more stories about troubled lives.  Well, I think Palahniuk really understands the meaning of compulsive disorder.  You have distinct writers for horror genre like Stephen King and law genre like John Grisham.  Right now, I think Chuck Palahniuk will follow into the footsteps of writing about wierdos.<br />The plot is actually quite believable about Victor Mancini, the greatest anti-hero of all time.  He is quite honestly a little messed up to say the least.  Victor has an ailing mother who is now in a mental hospital.  She mistakes him for her lawyer and never truly speaks to Victor as a son.  So, Victor must face death by choking in public restaurants.  This way, he can get some compensation for his meal and appeal to the kindness of strangers for money to pay for his mother's treatments.<br />Also, Victor has a problem with his constant gratification for sex.  So, he meets all sorts of losers from these self-help meetings.  Introduce some interesting characters like Denny, another messed up friend, and Paige Marshall, a nurse who takes care of his mother.  Well, you get the point since Palahniuk just feeds into the psyche of Victor with more troubles.<br />It just gets better when Victor tries to open up the past and thinks his life is not just some average Joe with some major sexual frustration.  Paige Marshall is the cute nurse who is the link between Victor and his mother.  She becomes interested in Victor and also wants to help him.  The plot gets better and has some wild twists as Victor learns who is his father.  Palahniuk then makes us actually appreciate Victor as he tries to better himself.  You even get to see Denny, his best friend, trying to get a stable girlfriend.  He then swears off his past and do completely good deeds.<br />This book is not exactly \\"The Fight Club\\" but probably much better in terms of character development.  I think Victor is most like some other troubled characters such as Holden Caufield in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".  Some may find the book a little graphic in content so just a warning to those who find gratutious reference to sex to be vulgar.  But, Palahniuk definitely makes this story really interesting by the dialogues between Victor and his mother, Paige Marshall, and Denny.  Give it a try and you might actually see how Victor actually tries to understand his life.  An eye-opening experience...bably much better in terms of character development.  I think Victor is most like some other troubled characters such as Holden Caufield in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".

B0000TG9E2|4.0|This isn't the best adaptation of Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice\\" stories, but it's a charming, fun film with great animated set-pieces. I'm staggered to see how beautifully the film has been restored: a comparison of the old video with the new reveals all sorts of detail in dark areas, especially backgrounds. Certain scenes now take place in day when they originally seemed to be at night! Without a doubt, this is the best restoration of a classic animated film I've ever seen.<br />The supplements, though, are wanting. The kiddie features are simply atrocious. The \\"Virtual Tea Party\\" is probably the most noxious DVD extra I have ever, ever encountered. Watch as character impressionists and a bunch of kids cavort around a tea party set, torturing the viewer with awful songs and games. \\"We're Painting Our Noses Red\\" is actually one of the better ones.<br />Other 2-disc Disney titles have similar bilge, but boast commentaries, documentaries, and restoration featurettes - none of which are on <I>Alice</i>. As a result, there is next to no modern perspective offered on the film itself, or the twenty-year quest to get it made. Aside from the segments on deleted songs, casual fans are left to guess at the significance of most of the `grown-up' supplements, including TV specials and a 1923 silent short. What's here is nice, but only for those in the know.<br />This is a great release for fans of the film, because of the beautiful restoration. Try and find it cheap, though, because the second disc isn't worth all that much.
B00009W0U4|4.0|IRREVERSIBLE for such title of an unconventional thriller literally means one is impossible to undo but to regret for what happened. But to look closer behind all due respects of the reverse scenes arrangement, the making of IRREVERSIBLE falls under that genre of cinematography which has totally no mercy to spare any brutal details of human violence as extreme as to vividly disclose all sorts of mankind sexual fetishes in its explicitness. Artistically or notoriously, that's up to anyone to say.<br />Outstanding, incredible performance though by the curvaceous Italian screen goddess Monica Bellucci (MALENA, BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF), and a multi foreign festival awards winning film by the fiercely intelligent French director Gaspar Noe (I have no problem with that). This film is seen mostly set upon nightime out-takes, from a rundown living hall with glimmering light across or the glittering posh interior of a eatery lounge, the downtown neon streets, inside the pedestrian underground tunnel or the subway train, to that somewhat bizarre hole on earth i.e. a sleazy S&M club. All these afterdark urban substances add a strong atmosphere to the film's brooding background that will leave you highly strung right from the start.<br />Run a play in one of those sleepless late night before your long couch and pour yourself, or/and your loved one, a good chilling drink. I gave 4 SOLID stars to this one no matter what they say.
B0001AP12G|5.0|damn, this cd is so cold!!!  every song of the album is just plain brilliance...dope beats and wise rhymes.  the standouts have to be &quot;all falls down&quot;, &quot;spaceship&quot;, &quot;never let me down&quot;, &quot;jesus walks&quot; and &quot;two words&quot;.  a lot of people may say that he is conceited but it is just confidence.  finally he gets to showcase his talent and silence all the record labels that wouldn't give him a break.  <br />if u have the cd copied or have the bootleg, get the real deal.  kanye deserves all the support he can get.  here in chicago, there were various bootlegs floating around and i have two versions but i still bought the real cd, which is better than all the bootlegs combined!!!!  also, be on the lookout for his next cd, &quot;late registration&quot; coming out next year!<br />if u get a chance to see him in concert, go see him!!!  his stage presence is unmatched by anyone!  i saw him about a week ago here in chicago and it was...damn, there's just no words for it.  see for yourself!!!!

B0001AP12G|5.0|Other than BlackStar and Illmatic, this CD is a serious contender for Raps greatest Debut/Release ever. The CD is so polished and the beats are Awsome. The lyrics are witty and not that complex but nice to bop to. Mos Def, Kweli, Common, Jay Z, Freeway, Twista and On ... This is an all-star collaboration backing up the best producer out. Kanye's College Dropout is the knife that would be used to murder gangster rap and if Dre doesnt pull anything out of his sleeve soon, itll devoure him also. Kanye and the ROC Familia are officially ontop of the game.

B000059H9E|5.0|This was the first Almodovar movie in which he used a higher picture quality, giving it a more hollywood look, ON THE SURFACE, but this is not hollywood-esque by any means other than that. The charcters are very Almodovar, in that most of them have serious issues. The Almodovar humor, like the grandma cutting the umbilical cord with her teeth, is there as well.<br />The story has to do with Victor, a young, naive pizza delivery boy who has a quick fling with a drugged out daughter of an Italian diplomat. He eventually finds her, and gets involved in a scuffle with her in her apartment, causing some neighbors to call over the police. The police confront the couple, a shot ends up being fired, and so commences our bizarre, black comedy, tragic love story. The acting is great, great script, beautifully shot, it really is an excellent film.<br />It is great to see legends like Pedro Almodovar continuing to get better and better. His last three have just been phenomanal, &quot;All about my mother&quot;, &quot;Live Flesh&quot; and &quot;Talk to her&quot;, can'd wait for his next release, &quot;Bad Education&quot; featuring Gael Garcia Bernal.

0380973839|2.0|I feel that \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is one of the best and most creative works of Science Fiction of all time, but I would recommend buying another copy of it.  There was one chapter in the original work that was taken out of this version.  Apparently the editors felt its racial themes were too strong, although I feel it was, in reality, speaking out against the racism of the 1950's.  Its ironic how Bradbury has always been so outspoken in his writing against censorship of books, and yet his own book was censored.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Being a comic book geek, I still believe that this is the best and most faithful adaptation of a comic book character yet.  Warner's has been kind of skimpy on added features with a lot of their classic films, but that's not the case here.  This wonderful film finally receives a well deserved update from Warner's, but misses the mark for perfection.<br />The picture and sound transfers are perfect (although I don't recall the &quot;flying credits&quot; sound muting out John Williams's awesome score in the beginning.  They seem extra loud here).  Other bonus goodies that are great: additional footage, previously only seen on TV prints, incorporated into the movie including Luthor's &quot;Gauntlet of Doom&quot; (which always makes me wonder why studios spend money on these sequences and then take them out??) and a directory of the added scenes; a soundtrack only option; an entertaining commentary by director Richard Donner and &quot;Script Consultant&quot; Tom Mankiewicz; and also entertaining Screen Tests for the role of Superman (sadly, it's just Christopher Reeve), Lois Lane (including Leslie Ann Warren, Susan Blakely and Stockard Channing), and Ursa (this one's really short though and does not show Sarah Douglas's test at all).  Knowing the potential costs for the rights to this footage, it's especially great that these were included.<br />All in all a great disc, but what's missing, you ask?  Well, if you like this movie and have never seen the extended TV versions, you might find nothing wrong here.  Warner's has included a &quot;whopping&quot; 2 deleted scenes, not incorporated back into the film.  Okay, that's nice, but where are all the other deleted and alternate scenes (nearly a half hour's worth of footage has been shown on TV, not including commericial time)?  And still Warner's insists on using those cheapo cardboard snap cases.  Even on Special Editions!  Arrrgh!  Come on Warner's!  When VHS first started out, Warner's was a pioneer in using clamshell cases for their videos and slowly phased them out, leaving Disney as the only one using them.  Now Warner's seem to be behind on the times with this, whereas everyone uses a great protective snap case but them.<br />All in all a great film, and a great DVD which is near prefect.  Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys this film and many of you probably won't be bothered by what I've complained is missing.  Definitely worth the price in any case.  Now if we could only get Warner's to do the same for Superman II!  <br />P.S. to Warner's - For part 2, it would be great if you could include some the &quot;lost/unused&quot; footage originally shot by Donner, before he was fired and replaced by Richard Lester, in the features section!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have bought all of Britney's music and my 8 and 14 year old daughters love her. I think she's a beautiful and talented person. I must be honest though, there are a couple of songs on this cd that I cannot stand. One is the second track, 'boom boom' because of the annoying male rapper heard at the beginning,middle,and end of the track. I don't know who this clown is that she colaborated with, but he sounds awful and ruins an otherwise tolerable song. On the other hand, 'toxic' and the last track 'everytime' are great songs. 'Everytime' is a pretty song, although quite short and I just wish the lyrics had more to them. I didn't know that there was an import with extra tracks on it, or I would have bought that instead, but we love Britney so maybe we'll get that one too.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|He's big. He's green. He's smelly. And he's funny all over. The name is Shrek, and he and his movie are one of the best things to come out of animation in a long time. I am kicking myself right now that it took me three years to finally see this magnificent gem of a film. Animation has really taken great leaps and bounds in the last ten years. With the release of the first \\"Toy Story\\" back in 1995, animation changed. The technology was more breathtaking and the imagery was as clear, precise, and beautiful as it can get. \\"Shrek\\" was different from the Pixar fair. It's animation was so detailed and rich, that sometimes you thought something looked real. I was also astounded by the clarity and sharpness of the animation to this film. The tale for the film, while quite simple, is steeped in traditinal fairy tale lore and has an epic feel and quality to it like any good fairy tale. Shrek The Ogre(voiced by Mike Meyers)lives alone in his swamp until one day he befriends a donkey(hilariously voiced by Eddie Murphy). Soon afterwards, all of the most famous characters from fairy tales, like Pinnochio, Three Blind Mice, Three Little Pigs, Gingerbread Man, and many others, have been banished to Shrek's peaceful little surroundings by the evil Lord Farquaad(voiced by John Lithgow). With the help of his new friend donkey, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad. If Shrek finds and brings back Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz), so that Farquaad can marry her and become a king, then Farquaad will give Shrek back his peaceful living existence. Then it's off for our two heroes to find and bring back the lovely princess. What follows is a fun adventure that has our two guys trying to save the princess from a scary castle and fire breathing dragon. What is most surprising, and ultimately different and refreshing, about the movie, is that it is not a typical animated film. The humor can get quite adult, as well as some of the dialogue. I was quite surprised when I heard some things in the film. This is what sets it apart from the pact, among a few other things, and it is it's riskiness in this area that makes the film stronger than most every other animation film. The voice talent is well cast and brilliant. Lithgow brings his usual brilliance to give a big voice to an evil character that is small in stature. Meyers does his usual scottish type schtick that he does all the time. But it's Murphy that gives the best performance and gives the movie most of it's bite. The characters, thanks in big part to the incredible cast, all have their own distinction and character to them. They are all three dimensional and that sometimes doesn't come off in an animated movie. The music selection is odd, but inspired. Where else are you going to hear the old Joan Jett hit \\"Bad Reputation\\" during an animated fight scene?. It's kind of like \\"Moulin Rouge\\" in that regard. Modern day music in a film that clearly takes place in a time long ago. The movie is so cleverly put together, intelligently written, and brilliant in it's artistic delivery, that it can't be classified as anything less than an animation classic and treasure. This is one for the vault.
B000002BE9|5.0|Like most people I heard of Ms. Apple through her singles. I enjoyed Shadowboxer and really liked Criminal, but the song became so overexposed that I eventually stopped paying attention. Now, all these years later I finally got around to buying this CD and I must say I'm stunned with the beauty that comes from this young lady's mouth. Criminal is a stand-out track, however, the real winner of this CD is \\"Never is a Promise\\". This song is so delicate, just a simple piano line augmented with a couple of violins. It is such an unexpected turn, and the song really hits the peak with the chorus at the end. Also, as odd as this sound, the last note the violins hit is just stunning. This CD is not what you expect from such a young singer, and really shows a bright future.
0156027321|5.0|This book is truly enchanting. The subtleties of the language really bring you into the author's world. I have recommended this book to several of my friends.
0385510438|4.0|My wife Michelle bought this book for me recently, and judging by the title I sat down prepared to read another of Grisham's famous books about lawyers.  To my surprise, this one was very different.  It seems Grisham has branched out recently with the Painted House, and Bleachers, and that has given him a different writing style than the one he was famous for in the Firm, Pelican Brief, and others.<br />This book takes place in a small town in 1970's Mississippi, and centers on a young man who has taken over the local newspaper.  The young man is not form the area and therefore is an outsider to the community he writes his newspaper for.  The story flows with the slow steady pace of life in the Deep South, and is rich with detail and the mood of the time.  While not as quickly engaging as some of his lawyer books, this one has far more substance.<br />Grisham depicts the struggle with racism, the naivet&eacute; of youth, and the &quot;above the law&quot; clans of bootleggers and crooked police.  The best aspects of the story were the ways in which this 23 year old owner of the local newspaper has to learn the ropes.  Blessed with a youthful enthusiasm, yet to be tempered with wisdom, he finds himself in the eye of the storm.  When he prints news articles about the murder, and the accused, he suddenly finds himself center stage in a hotbed of corruption and a public trail he is seen to have influenced.<br />I won't spoil the plot any further, as this book is a great one to pick up and read cold.  Overall, I recommend this as a good departure from Grisham's usual formula.  If you liked a &quot;Painted House&quot; then I think you will find this book closer in style to that one.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is one of Judy Garlands finest films.  Everything about the film works so well.  Beautiful costumes, great songs. and a great cast.  But mostly the magic of Garland brings the whole film to perfection. The beautiful and authentic sets almost draw you into the screen and make you feel you are in the early 1900s. And isn't that what movie making is really all about?<BR>Its absolutely the perfect movie musical!!
B00006LLNU|5.0|....just a few adjectives that come to mind when I think of this album.<br />As many have explained before me, to describe the beauty of this album is a pretty difficult a task to undertake, so I can only offer my sincerest reccomendations.  It took me awhile to overcome my initial misgivings, but this album has become dear to me.  This is evocative music; every track oozes nostalgia.  Personally, it brings to my mind the sight of fresh snowfall; others have described it as bringing to mind the stars, or the ocean.  It may have a similar effect on you.<br />Do this music justice.  Just get a hold of it; buy it, borrow it, whatever...and listen to it.  Straight through, if you can.  Give the music a chance to settle down in the dark corners of your mind.  You won't regret it, I guarantee it.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Dark, and totally action packed.
B00000AFDW|1.0|You know what they should have done?<br />Re-recorded entirely their 'Hotter Than Hell' album from 1974. And released that instead. Of all the 70's KISS albums, Hotter Than Hell is one of the worst sounding albums Todd Rundgren DIDN'T engineer. Particularly 'Mainline' and 'Comin' Home'. That I would have paid for.
0792162803|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever made.  This movie is filled with memeorable quotes, including Father Ridley's sermon-esque opinions about VD.  Also it is a really positive story Mary went from having a bad self image to not caring what anyone thinks of her.  Also Molly Shannon is just an amazing actress and commedianne.  She can do no wrong when it comes to comedy.  I would say that if you have a true sense of humor, you will enjoy this movie.
044022165X|1.0|This is my least favorite Grisham book.  Aside from the underdeveloped plot, the characters are very flat.  And, the story, especially the ending, is so completely far-fetched, it makes the endings of The Firm and The Pelican Brief seem plausible.<br />I don't understand the hype this book receives, it certainly doesn't deserve it.  Grisham knows how to keep the reader captivated, so it's disappointing to read something like this and know that he could have done a lot better.
0671027344|5.0|I'm not the type who likes to read those diary stories, I'm not a deep thinker, and I would usually choose sports or tv over a book.  Not with this one.   His point of view is fascinating, and he raises amusing and curious thoughts, all while telling his entrancing story.  And the thing about it is it's really not out of the ordinary in the way of events.  He's not Harry Potter, dealing with a magical world.  He's not a movie star writing about his woes.  He is a wallflower.  The things he notices in everyday situations make you want to stop what you're doing and just think about things.  I dunno, maybe I don't explain it well.  But I definately recommend this book.  The way we do it at my school is that we have one copy that circulates, and every person chooses a color, and highlights parts that they like.  It's one of those books that has stuff to highlight in it.
B0000DC13U|5.0|A profound visual masterpiece describing the creative process like no other. Sure it avoids typical camera angles, numerous cuts, and trite superfluous information you'd see in other films about musicians. Feel lucky to be invited to experience a band in the midst of the creative process, a song from its most infant stage elevated and fine tuned in a grand crescendo. Jean Luc Godard was a film genius, artist, and cultural sponge. Who better to describe fleeting inspiration, on film and documented forever, for us all to see.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Bill Murray is a funny guy. Inventive, great comedic timing, etc, etc. Lost in Translation is NOT funny and probably isn't meant to be. More of a thoughtful film about two people being lonely in a crowd. In that regard, it get's it's point across, but it just didn't have the entertainment value I anticipated when renting the movie. <BR>There was the amusing mis-communication between English and Japanese languages. There was the amusing \\"westernization\\" of the Japanese - the clothing, hairstyles and personna adapted from too much American TV and movies, the advanced video games, the glitter of high tech, etc.<BR>There was the connection between Murray and his female co star. But it seemed shallow and left me disappointed with the movie in general. <BR>Again, Murray is a likeable guy. But, I'm afraid the movie's translation was really lost - on me.<BR>John Row<br />I went back and rewatched this movie. I figured that with so many \\"not helpful\\" votes I may have misssed something. Maybe the movie was really deep and beyond my shallow viewing, I hadn't rated it fairly. After rewatching it, I've come to the same conclusion. It is not a very good movie. Bill Murray did not give a very good performance<BR>John Row

0380002930|5.0|Watership Down by Richard Adams is one of those rare novels that seem to create a world within a few pages. You know what I mean. The books they place high on the shelves as timeless classics, which are read 50 years from now by your grandchildren. It is a masterpiece. I have no reason to embellish, and in truth, doesn¡¦t need to. After running through the first chapter, I was hooked. I could very well have sat there and read the whole book from cover to cover. The novel is about a group of rabbits who have decided to leave their current warren to escape a disaster that was about to fall upon their homes. From there on they are thrust into a journey of fear and joy, where they finally discover their true ¡§home¡¨.<br /> The chapters where I had enjoyed this book the most were the parts that included the rabbit¡¦s references to man¡¦s strangeness. The Lapine try to explain tar-layered roads, cigarettes, boats, bridges, and automobiles from their view. And are usually not far from the truth, I guess the author is trying to show animals are not that different from us. Not only was I attracted to the suspenseful atmosphere of Fiver¡¦s forewarnings, I also cheered as Hazel, Bigwig, Blackberry, and the crew finally managed to learn the art of working together. Elation filled me with each scheme the rabbits hatched, and I jumped around with glee at each of their hard-won successes. <br /> Richard Adams has created life. He provides the rabbits with their own culture and myths, not to mention their own language! By constantly inserting vocab from the Lapine Glossary in the back, Adams enriches the story¡¦s realism and bedazzles the reader. He has created society after society with his seemingly parallels to communism, tyranny, and monarchy. An allegory, Watership Down has been called, and one that is said to reflect his personal views. Personally, I don¡¦t care. He has ensnared me with his loyal and intelligent rabbit character crew, and I have no wish to free myself from them.
0141301139|5.0|This book has been my favorite ever since the first time that I read it. It tells the story of a fox who has to go out and get food from three farms that are nearby in order to feed his family, but there are three farmers, named Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, who don't like the fact that Mr. Fox is stealing from them and they band together to kill him. He then has to find ways to avoid the farmers and save his family at the same time. The book keeps little children hanging on every word and has an excellent ending that they'll love. The excitement makes it a great book to read to little brothers, sisters, or kids. I read it to my sister and she wouldn't let me stop till I had finished the entire book.<br />Roald Dahl makes some of the greatest children's books that are very imaginative and help develop a child's imagination. I would recommend that on top of this one, get some of Roald Dahl's other books.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|If you only own one Dylan album, make &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; the one you own! It's a good even mix of folk/rock and folk. Every song is an instant classic and the songs that had a message back in 1965 still hold relevance today. The most well-written song on this package has to be &quot;It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;. As you listen to these lyrics and think about modern times you realise that Bob is STILL onto something. This album also features the hits: &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Easily one of the worst movies of all time. Sappy, poorly acted, next to no plot. The saving graces for the film were the sweeping views and special effects, though they were hardly enough to waste your time on.<br />The movie brings nothing to the table and leaves you with exactly that, nothing. DiCaprio looks young and out of place in what was supposed to be a steamy love affair. Winslet looks the part but can't seem to get a line out without some odd facial expressions. Certainly one of Camerons worst works yet.
0780631684|1.0|I try to have faith in people but when a movie like this is praised as intelligent...  The movie stars a lame cast of teens that missed there flight to france, then the jet blows up.  apparently because these kids missed the doomed flight it set Death behind his yearly death quota.  A series of mouse trap inspired death traps follow to reach the death quota (apparantly death is tired of bloodclots) in the end most of the kids die some of them live.  Hey fellow teens if you want to see intelligent movies go to stanley kubrick and orson wells not this trash.

B00018D44U|5.0|I laugh when I read the reviews of people who say it's a disappointment, etc. My guess is that the people who didn't like the last record won't like this one either lol.<br />This album is an extension of the same *everything* the last one had. &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; is so unreal (I mention it only because it's playing now). This is just such a great record. It would be impossible to find someone who liked &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; who did not like this one just as much. She may as well have released a double CD at the same time; that's how close they are.
0062502182|5.0|To keep it short, I did not read the end of this book as I am prone to do.  It was incredibly interesting to me.  For some reason, I did not even think to read ahead that is how much I loved this book.  Although, orginally I was just going to throw this book back onto amazon or ebay, I do not believe that I can part with this book.  Read this book, if it is the only book you read this year.  It is perfect.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is what the Matrix could have been if it actually had a quality lead actor and a story. The action scenes sting you with ferocity and originality, and you can't take your eyes off Christian Bale. When you watch this excellent movie you will know why Bale is the perfect choice to play Batman/Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's upcoming film, Batman: Intimidation.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Let me start out by saying that this film left me quite embarrassed. I had been looking very forward to watching it and even had my wife view it with me after spending a week raving to her about the film.  I really wanted to love this film as I normally hate the all action, two-dimensional characters mostly seen in films nowadays...well in this film we have no action and still two-dimensional characters. I actually apologized to my wife for wasting her time.  She herself was stunned to learn this film was nominated for so many awards since it was almost unwatchable. <br />I have read many of the reviews here and have come to the conclusion that the only ones who gave this film a great review are those who consider themselves intellectuals.  They see this film as a way of confirming that they are better than normal folks since they can watch a film devoid of all plot or character development, yet still gain spiritual enlightenment from the movie.  This is similiar to those who profess to love the abstract paintings in which a chimp could do a better job.  I've seen paintings few dots and nothing else and heard people raving on its magnificance.  This film is sort of the same.  So when you read a positive review, keep in mind that the writer is probably as aware as you are that the film sucked..only less honest than you because that would make them the same as you intellectually.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I'll probably listen to this soundtrack almost as much as I listen to the LOTR soundtracks!  Great for us armchair orchestra conductors.  :)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is truly another masterpiece for the lyrical mastermind and lead singer of Tool.  I would recomend this cd to everyone (but I must warn you that if you have never listened to any prevoius works by Tool or APC then it might take 4 or 5 listens to fall in love with it).  Maynards lyrics on this cd are probobaly the best they have ever been and the deep and meaningful lyrics don't hurt at all. But the lyrics are not the only plus to this cd and this is where APC really differ from tool, because where tool has an agressive, heavy sound, APC has a softer more passive sound to it.  This can be both a good or a bad thing depending on your taste(I perfer Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step to Opiate or Undertow but I really love them all)  And another thing don't expect this to be the same as Mer De Noms, because it isn't, in my opinion it is better but there are many who would argue with me, but the fact is that this(and Mer De Noms) are GREAT cds.  I won't go into detail about all the songs(because they are all great) but some of my favorites are The Noose, Blue, The Outsider, and Pet. Overall I recomend getting this album right away and if you give it a chance I can almost gurantee you will love it.<br />P.S.  Also check out Opiate, Undertow, Salival, Aenema, Lateralus, and Mer De Noms, all other great works by Maynard.
6304457383|5.0|A drug dealer enlists two conmen to help him retrieve a drug-filled doll from a blind woman. <br />Audrey Hepburn is very credible as the lovely Susie Hendrix, a feminine and insightful lady who has recently lost her eyesight in an accident. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. plays her rigid but compassionate husband; one of his emotional reactions is my only problem with the movie, and even that can be overlooked. Julie Herrod is the bratty but fairly well drawn Gloria, and Richard Crenna and Jack Weston play the two conmen. Jack Weston's character is the simpler of the two, and Richard Crenna is the dishonest but convincingly charming. The intelligent Harry Roat (or however you spell it) is played by Alan Arkin. Roat is just creepy. He gives bad vibes.<br />'Wait Until Dark' is one of my favorite films. The mood, supported by music, excellent acting, and an interesting plot, remains tense throughout the movie.
B00004RFCM|5.0|If you haven't seen Sex and the City by now, then you have missed out on the best sex of your life.  This show is just FABULOUS!  The show follows 4 single women living in New York City.  They each experience the ups and downs of dating and maintaining successful careers.  Above all else, this show is about the close bond of friendship these women share.  They are always there for each other despite any disagrements they have.  While it reflects a somewhat idealisitc life (there is no apartment in NYC with a closet as big as Carrie's), you can still enjoy the stories week after week.<br />I truly love this show.  I never get tires of watching these episodes over and over.  Unlike other shows, this show just kept getting better and better, season after season.  I talk about it so much at work that I even got my boss to watch seaons 1,2,and 3.  She is now hooked.  Get all of the seasons, invite your best friends over, make some cosmos, and enjoy the night.  You won't regret it.
B000065PUE|4.0|Although my favourite Pixies album is Trompe Le Monde (those who claim that this album is bad just don't understand it)and Surfer Rosa is my second favourite, I still find Doolittle an enjoyable experience. I would regard it as an equal to Bossanova. Opener, Debaser, is a great adrenaline packed blast of punk-pop energy. Tame and Wave Of Mutilation are both great songs. I don't really dig I Bleed but I'm sure others may like it. Here Comes Your Man has a nice melody. Dead is one of my favourite songs, it's cool. Lets see.....I don't really dig Monkey Gone To Heaven but most Pixies fans seem to like it so you might too. Mr.Grieves and Crackity Jones are both cool songs. La La Love You is really brilliant. Drummer, David Lovering, delivers a great vocal performace. The album ends with a handful of great songs : Number 13 Baby, the interesting Silver, the brilliant guitar-work of Joey Santiago on Hey, the great chorus on There Goes My Gun and of course the rock masterpiece that is Gouge Away. I really think you'd dig this album if you bought it. In fact, I think you'd dig any Pixies album, except maybe Trompe Le Monde which only appeals to certain people. Thank you for your time.
B000050IE6|5.0|This is Death Metal laced with beautiful acoustic passages and clean vocals.  Seriously, what can I add to praise this band of extraodinary musicians even more?  This album has flare and subtlety, superb songwriting and incredibly catchy riffs.  There is one particular riff on &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; that gave me such a buzz the first time I heard it I was absolutely giddy.  These guys are pure masters at their craft and should be listened to by all.  While this album doesn't have the spit-and-polish production of &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; it is exceptional nonetheless.  Outstanding, once again.  Another masterpiece.
0312263120|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The DaVinci Code, so I rather eagerly bought this book, thinking it was new. But in fact, it is an older (1998) attempt at writing about technology that is just dreadful, and should never have made it out of manuscript form without a rigorous edit and rewrite (or two or three). While it is nice to realize how much Dan Brown has grown as a writer, I simply felt ripped off by the publisher. Absurd dialog, absurd plot replete with not-believable characters with about as much appeal as old carpet remnants. Clearly this was rushed into publication to capitalize on the success and fame of The DaVinci Code but for goodness sake, couldn't the publisher have run it through the editorial mill? I'd send my copy back to the publisher but paying for the postage would be throwing good money after bad.

B000002WYT|4.0|A classic DMB album, it stradles the gap between grass roots and full-blown mainstream arenas, uniting the two - the most obvious example within their career that adeptly demonstrates they can represent both worlds at the same time.  \\"#41\\" & \\"Two Step\\" are my faves.
B00003CXIP|5.0|First off, if you don't buy this movie because some off his rocker reviewer called this the best \\"gay\\" movie ever, you are missing out.  In actuality, this movie is devoid of sex/sexual interests, besides the occasion juvenile rantings of a typical boy coming into puberty.  This movie is about friendship and has absolutely nothing to do with sexual preference.  <br />That being said, the movie is one of those experiences that take you back to your own childhood.  The innocence,loyalty, friendship, and adventure that you can really only have all at the same time at one part of your life.  As someone else has already mentioned, you can watch this movie again, and again without getting bored with it.  It reminds you of the deep lows and very high highs in that time where being accepted by your peers and belonging was the most important thing in life besides your family.  If you are a guy over 25, you have to see this movie.
0312995423|1.0|I knew I wouldn't enjoy this book when 21 pages in the author completely botched the explanation of public key encryption. I'm not a cryptographer, computer scientist, or national security expert, just an average guy who uses a PC. Anyone who's ever read a single newspaper or internet article about encryption probably has the facts more correct than this author did.<BR>Reading techno-thrillers, like sci-fi or big-budget action flicks requires a \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" But if the author is going to try to pass himself off as an expert in something he clearly isn't, and make a huge mistake, it's hard to take anything after that seriously.<BR>The rest of the cryptography discussion is over my limited knowledge, or completely made up, doesn't matter. The computing terms thrown in read like the author made a laundry list of every acronym, protocol, and technology he'd ever read about and just dumped them in every-other sentence to impress readers.<BR>If you can use your computer for more than email and web browsing, you'll be thoroughly insulted by this.<BR>And, yes, the plot is weaker than the single digit \\"kill code,\\" as are the paper thin characters.
B00012L786|5.0|If you are looking at this dvd you most likely have already seen the film and are thrilled it is finally available on this wonderful format, or you just like Samuel Fuller's work and are interested what this may be about. I just picked the dvd up today and I am extremely excited. Criterion has done it once again. The transfer is amazing and the film looks gorgeous. I have never seen the movie look so good, and the audio mix sounds great . Well done again Criterion! This is one of Fuller's best and anyone interested in his work should definitely pick this up. I was shocked to find out this was not one of Criterion's $35 dvds. To me, the extras alone are worth the $25.99. We get a 10min doc about the opening of the film in which Fuller himself explains the technical achievements and meanings he was trying to convey. We also get a 20min doc with Sam talking about the film, the studio, his fascination with his characters, and even J. Edgar Hoover.  If you have never heard Sam speak, you are in for a real treat because he is at the top of his game here. I have Tigrero and The Typewriter, The Camera, and the Rifle and I feel these two new gems are a perfect fit into the limited collection of footage we have with Sam. Also Criterion throws in trailers for &quot;Fixed Bayonets&quot;, &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;, &quot;House of Bamboo&quot;, &quot;China Gate&quot;, &quot;Forty Guns&quot;, &quot;Hell and High Water&quot;, &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; (teaser), &quot;Shock Corridor&quot;, and &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot;. This is one of Criterion's and Fuller's best. You should pick it up today. If you are interested in the plot read below or check out imdb.
B000002L9W|4.0|After the swing and easy-going light rock of Crazy From The Heat, rock and roll's clown prince, Diamond Dave, got serious and went into high gear with Eat'em And Smile, which benefits from the production of former Van Halen-producer Ted Templeman as well as guitar theatrics by Steve Vai, who really clowns around in the beginning of &quot;Yankee Rose.&quot;<br />&quot;Wild wild wild&quot; aptly describes &quot;Yankee Rose,&quot; which was the first single, and his anthropomorphising America as a woman with all sorts of patriotic themes and compliments makes me wonder if he was trying to one-up his former band with some rampaging patriotism.<br />The rapid-fire &quot;Shyboy&quot; benefits from Vai's high-energy and Gregg Bisonette's drums.  &quot;Gotta keep things moving till my personality starts improving!&quot; he sings.  Well, things are moving here all right, but I didn't think his personality needed improving.<br />His cover of the upbeat early rock of &quot;I'm Easy&quot; is a gear up from Crazy From The Heat, as it does have some horns, arrangements courtesy of Vai.<br />Things slow down a pace with &quot;Ladies' Nite In Buffalo?&quot; which sports a pulsing bass and rhythm reminding me of Heart's &quot;Straight On&quot;<br />DLR actually does go &quot;crazy from the heat&quot; in &quot;Goin' Crazy&quot; a good-natured single featuring a synthesizer that many might accuse him of trying to imitate his former band.  The protagonist is having a heck of a ball, getting drunk, in trouble with the police, and messing with mayor's daughter.  One of the better songs here nevertheless.<br />Apart from easy listening and jump swing, the blues was another influence in DLR's life, as he covers John Loudermilk's &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; done in his hard-rock style and with some keyboards.  As on &quot;Shyboy&quot; and &quot;Goin' Crazy,&quot; bassist Billy Sheehan helps Roth on backing vocals.  Vai does some pretty fiery bluesy guitar here.<br />Many of the other songs have higher energy than the singles. One of those is the chugging &quot;Elephant Gun,&quot; the instrument used by the protagonist, who seems like someone in a film-noir type situation, someone playing both sides of the laws, and out protecting dames.  Another is the aptly-titled &quot;Bump And Grind&quot; about getting lucky with either dancers or strippers.<br />Finally, my favourite song on this album.  His cover of Frank Sinatra's &quot;That's Life&quot; shows how he can laugh at the bumps life gives him, true to having an artistic temperament.  This is a great way to end the album, although I wonder if it could've been just as great tacked onto Crazy From The Heat.  Along with horns and strings, there is support from the Waters Family on female backing vocals.<br />Eat'em And Smile is a great boost in his solo career.  While not as heavy as any of the prominent Van Halen albums, it shows DLR has an ace up his sleeve, Steve Vai, who nears Eddie Van Halen's virtuosity.  But the goofy swagger of Diamond Dave is unabated here, to wit words from &quot;Goin' Crazy,&quot; he may be going coconuts, but at least he's going his way.ve higher energy than the singles.

B00005YUNY|5.0|If anyone would know how to use an orchestra, it's Yes.  What other bands have attempted, Yes has mastered.  Yes treats the orchestra like the other masterful musicians involved, sometimes in the forefront, sometimes in the background and a solo or two.<br />Seemingly a little hesitant in Close to the Edge, they still pull it off nicely.  They seem to settle into a groove in Long Distance Runaround.  Don't Go is their usual ill-advised attempt at a radio hit, but still a pretty good song.  The other new song, In The Presence Of, is beautiful and timely.<br />Then comes their 23 minute epic, the Gates of Delirium.  Here the orchestra provides the ultimate enhancement IMO.  When the song reaches its fever-pitch halfway through, the entire sonic spectrum is filled to the point where you'll be hard pressed to mentally process it!  It achieves the intended effect of depicting the chaos of war.<br />The remainder of the songs make wonderful use of the orchestra as well.  If you have any appreciation for the music of Yes, I highly recommend this DVD.
0452282152|2.0|After all the hype, this is disappointing.  Lawrence Johnson's review below (dated February 8) says it all.<br />If this book aspires to anything, it is sexual coming-of-age for the heroine.  Anticipation and tension lend an erotic air, but the story never really lifts off.  The bits about art and Vermeer's life may be gleaned from artbooks or biographies.<br />It's like superior Mills & Boon romance, with its stereotypes: the downtrodden heroine, the sexy, enigmatic master,  quasi-evil patrons, jealous wives/mothers/daughters.  Unfortunately the narrative is limited to the single perspective of the self-satisfied Griet.  But other viewpoints, such as that of her suitor, the sexy but smelly young butcher Pieter, or her antagonist, the vindictive Cornelia, would have given more light and shade.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This must be the most overrated movie in cinema history. A depressed boring has-been actor meets a depressed boring unhappy young wife and they do unmemorable things in Japan. The screen chemistry between the main characters is about the same as between a brick and a bar of soap. Bill Murray acts like he is pumped with Thorazine.<br />This is truly one of the dullest, worst movies that I have ever seen. I literally had to keep waking myself up to keep watching it.<br />The Emperor truly has no clothes. Sofia Coppola should get a job as a manicurist in Long Island.
B000063DHL|5.0|I'd like to say that this is probably the 2nd most influencial album in the Maiden catalog. My favorite along with the monster known as Powerslave!Here's how I rate each song:<br />1. Caught Somewhere in Time-a dark brooding opener. Very, very fast and loud. An 8 minute song that gets you pumped up. Absolutely the best song on the album.<BR>        <BR>2. Wasted Years-the first single of the album. A very eerie and futuristic intro will warn you of the power of this song. Both lyrically and musically.<BR>       <BR>3. Sea of Madness-The loudest song Maiden has made. Thundering drums, screaming guitars, and a heavy bass coupled with Bruce's signature voice makes this an absolute Maiden classic.<BR>        <BR>4. Heaven Can Wait-a very uplifting song if you ask me. You can't help but smile while listening to this. Although its fun, the power of the band can't get past this.  <BR>     <BR>5. Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner-Its unknown if they based it on the old movie with the same title. This is very very cool if it wasn't for the cheesy lyrics.<BR>        <BR>6. Stranger in a Strange Land-the other single of the album. A soft track which bursts into a pummeling chorus. Beautiful.<BR>        <BR>7. De Ja Vu-definetely my favorite song on this album. Very very fast and Bruce is in total top shape! I love the chorus and Bruce is growling in the verses! Classic! Classic!<BR> <BR>8. Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.)-the unbelievable ending to a great album. A history lesson in just 8 minutes! Unbelievable! <BR>Up the Irons!<br />Overall, this is one hell of an album! A must have to every metal fan or Maiden fan. UP THE IRONS!
031286504X|3.0|Good story, but the style was quite dry. Certainly creative but lacked a spark to make it completely entertaining. The investment in the story you make as the reader is never paid off by Matheson. It's like reading the newspaper; sometimes riveting, usually mildly interesting, but rarely entertaining. One other HUGE point I'd like to make that seems neglected by all other descriptions and reviews of this book. Only two-thirds of this book's length are taken up by &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, the rest is a bunch of short stories, which aren't very good either in my humble opinion. I wish someone had told _me_ that before I bought it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I asked my best friend for a CD this year--I knew Celine Dion had recorded one, but I didn't know what it was called.  I just thought it would be nice to have.  It came a little before Christmas, and I took it to work.  I was drawn in immediately from the first strains of &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;  This was a phenomenal CD!  I loved hearing her record with her family. I have always loved &quot;The Prayer.&quot;  &quot;The Magic of Christmas Day&quot; was by far my favorite.  I plan to try to have my students perform that song next year if at all possible.  I love many of Celine's other CD's, but this is tops as far as I am concerned.  I suppose I am a sucker for a great Christmas CD!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I give this movie 2 stars because of the nice scenery shots of Tokyo. Otherwise, this film nearly lulled me to sleep. It seemed like the only purpose of this film was to shoot nice scenery. As for the plot, to sum it up, 2 people meet in a hotel while on business trips. A young girl who does not get along well with people her own age, falls for an older more seasoned man. That man is Bill Murray's character, who is not interesting at all. He sits around staring out windows and drinking in a hotel bar. Except for the occasional monotone phone conversation with his wife, he hardly shows any character. Why this young girl is suppose to fall in love with this dreary older man is a complete mystery to me. I guess love is blind, in this case it is VERY blind. The worst part is when they decide to go out on the town. They encounter annoying and tacky people who like to sing karaoke. I am really under the assumption that people think just because a film is being shown at an independent art theater, it is a good film. or maybe they will feel uncultured if they do not like the film. Whatever the case, this dreary movie will not get a 2nd viewing from me.
1593080492|3.0|Jane Austen delivers an interestingly romantic story of two sisters and their everchanging love lives.  Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century.  As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it.  This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships. Although, the intriguing manner of the Dashwood girls did have me interested at times.  I found myself laughing at their wit and quirky dispositions. I would recommend this book to an older audience who can appreciate a more old-fashioned style of romantic novel.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|It took me a while to warm up to this CD.  The first couple times I listened to it, I didn't like it and thought I'd wasted my money, but after a few more times I was hooked.  I've been listening to it all the time now and I keep liking it more and more!  If you don't like it at first, give it a chance, it just might grow on ya!
B0000VD04M|5.0|This film probably was stopped on dvd, for legal reasons, otherwise, why would the movie studio print up all the copies, film the special features and ship em, only to destruct em.  Im sure as soon as the legal aspect is fixed, we will get the movie on DVD!!!!!  Remember people, They want to sell the movie as bad as we want to own it!
B00005JKC3|3.0|PLUSES:  I felt compelled to write this review only after seeing &quot;The Hulk&quot; on DVD, which I now own.  I had previously seen the movie on the big screen and, having been confused and disappointed by it, hoped that a second viewing would find me more forgiving of Ang Lee's effort to portray one of the classic Marvel superheroes.  Indeed, I recommend that even if you disliked it at first, &quot;The Hulk&quot; is one of those movies that grows on you the next time around in spite of its many flaws.  Bottom line is that the special effects, the visuals, and the action scenes rock, though at times pushing the boundaries of &quot;reasonable&quot; suspension of reality/belief.  Yes, the CGI could've been less &quot;PS2&quot; but the Hulk on a rampage was just like what I wanted to see in a live action film.<br />MINUSES:  Alas, as far as the screenplay and the story, it is clear to me that Ang Lee was in a no-win situation from the get-go because he did not seem to understand what the character of the Hulk meant and how it fit into American pop culture.  This resulted in a big-budget B monster flick that could have easily been Fing Fang Foom instead of the Incredible Hulk.  Had Ang Lee's writer been Peter David or Bruce Jones, things would have been otherwise - but that's not the way it went.  Still, many kudos go out to Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and to Sam Elliott as General Thunderbolt Ross.  Eric Bana was handed an unplayable role as Bruce Banner.  The rest of the cast could've been anyone else.  As for David Banner (Nick Nolte) becoming the Absorbing Man, my only thought on it is still, &quot;what the heck????&quot;<br />To conclude, I do have just one thing that bothers me about the whole project.  In the DVD, both in the film's end-credits and in the interviews/special features, there is a lot of talk about the Hulk, Stan Lee, and Ang Lee.  Where in all this is JACK KIRBY??  I guess Stan forgot all about the co-creator of the Hulk, though they seemed to use Kirby's artwork all over.  I am not sure what the deal is with that.  Without Jack Kirby, neither Stan Lee nor Ang Lee would've had much material to work from (without belittling the efforts of the copious amounts of very talented writers and artists who have done the Hulk since the 1960's.)  I will close by saying that I have the notion that Jack Kirby would've enjoyed the movie but that he would've had a pointer or two to give Ang Lee on how the Hulk should be portrayed, and who all of those characters in the supporting cast were supposed to be.  Though I am all for reimagining and retelling classic stories, in this case all we got was a Hulk, but not necessarily the Incredible HULK.
B00018D44U|4.0|I loved the first Norah Jones (Come Away With Me)and was afraid that she couldn't repeat it.  But this has just swept me up!  The bluesy voice is what I sign on for, but the bit of country with Dolly Parton was startling and enticing.  I think that if you like Norah you'll love this.
B000089CJI|4.0|Side projects, as a general rule, are not a good idea. Chances are, a side project will not turn out real well. But the Postal Service actually turns out quite well. Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello make a really good team.<BR>I wasn't sure what to expect when I first got this album. I'm a big fan of Death Cab, but I just couldn't see Gibbard working out real well with electronic stuff. But Tamborello makes it blend very nice. Gibbard keeps the same singing style and lyrics, but the feel to his songs are totally different. They seem a lot brighter and more happy. The backup vocals, done by Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, add a lot to the music as well. Overall, a very well done album.
B000002H70|5.0|Usually a band's most popular album is not their best work; this one is. The Cure made no compromises on 'Disintegration' yet managed to create their biggest seller to date. It is no accident. From start to finish the album is complete in its ability to creating sweeping, atmospheric music that totally envelops the listener without ever becoming boring. Many of the songs require 7+ minutes to unfold yet never is there a dull moment.<br />\\"Plainsong\\", the opener, is a soaring, orchestral piece that is both forceful and beautiful; it begin the album with a flourish. \\"Pictures of You\\", the 4th single from the album and featured today in a TV ad (there must be 100 ads w/ 80's songs in the last 4 years), is a charming ballad that was accompanied by an equally charming video. The video juxtaposed a band in the cold of the Arctic surrounded by palm trees; like the palm trees in the Arctic the pictures provide no warmth or feeling despite what they represent - a great pop song. Skipping ahead, \\"Lovesong\\" was the smash hit that catapulted the band to mainstream success, but that doesn't mean it was a sellout by any means. Lovesong was a minor-chord miracle full of plaintive keys, a sad bassline and bittersweet lyrics. \\"Last Dance\\" is the ultimate if atypical breakup song - the perfect ode to ending it on mournful yet respectful terms. \\"Lullaby\\", creepy but catchy, was the 3rd chronological single - the video was a masterpiece and had a strange hidden (and perhaps unintentional) statement on Smith's relationships with women... at one point he is being swallowed by, well \\"it\\" (he may say \\"Spiderman\\" but we ain't buyin' it). \\"Fascination Street\\", the lead single, is a powerhouse Goth jam highlighted by one of the best bass rhythms to be found anywhere; it just throbs and emanates energy. The song may be eerie but you can certainly jam to it. The best may be \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\" which will totally immerse you is its wet, multi-layered depths; it is a complex and hauntingsong.<br />Simply said, this is the Cure's best, the best of the decade and likely a top 10 ever for any genre.
0060955775|4.0|A truly inspiring book by Paul Coelho, \\"Veronika Decides to die\\"<br />Paul Coelho's amazing fictional character Veronika illustrates life experience of mentally ill himself. You'll be amazed how ridiculous he has chosen the name Veronika for this book, or should I say, a bit of coincidence?<br />This book is about a young woman Veronika, who has gotten everything what man wants, she is pretty and nothing falls behind in her attractiveness. Yet, she tries to kill herself and one day she wakes up in Villete the mental hospital, and alerted by the nurse she has got 5 more days to live.<br />I think this book is a bit too dramatic but so interesting finding why she tries abandon this world, and its more fascinating how she work through herself until the fifth day, and perhaps after that too.<BR>You'll be interested how Paul Coelho describes the environment of a mental hospital, you will be stirred; what you thought of mental hospital would be like is not the way you think it is. Paul again makes scenes so realistically I feel like I'm part of this book.<BR>I like how Paul distinguishes between a mad man and a normal man and it will definitely surprise you. <br />I truly respect Paul after reading his book, I feel this world is full of conformist, and I think this is what his trying to tell us is to develop your own culture between you and your peers, which makes you unique. I wish to say this is a must-see book, this book makes you think back of your memories and also think ahead and you'll see the importance of life.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for &quot;Daredevil&quot;, I just knew that I had to find out who the hell was singing in the background.  Once I found out it was a band called Evanescence, I became completely obsessed (in a good way though, not a psychotic way).  I spent week after week downloading each and every song I could find from them.  I spent every day at my job talking to people on their message board (I ended up losing that job of course).  I ended up being able to find every single song they have ever recorded including their first few unknown albums Origin, Evanescence, Whisper/Sound Asleep, etc.  The day &quot;Fallen&quot; came out, April 4, 2003, was the same day I saw them for the very first time in concert.  This was the most amazing show I could ever even imagine.  Amy Lee has the most outstanding, beautiful, and powerful voice I have ever heard (she's pretty damn hot, too).  Evanescence is now my favorite band ever, and their debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; is the greatest album ever known to mankind.  Every song on it could be a hit number one single.  Everyone always says they sound like Linkin Park with a chick singer.  Now this is true on some songs, but for the most part, they have a completely different sound all on their own.  I have given every song on this album a 5, but if I had to pick just one or two favosites they would include:  Haunted, Tourniquet, Taking Over Me, and My Immortal.<br />01 - Going Under - 5/5<BR>02 - Everybody's Fool - 5/5<BR>03 - Bring Me To Life - 5/5<BR>04 - My Immortal - 5/5<BR>05 - Haunted - 5/5<BR>06 - Tourniquet - 5/5<BR>07 - Imaginary - 5/5<BR>08 - Taking Over Me - 5/5<BR>09 - Hello - 5/5<BR>10 - My Last Breath - 5/5<BR>11 - Whisper - 5/5
0679720200|5.0|Although Albert Camus had achieved some fame as a journalist in his native Algiers in the thirties and as a writer for the French resistance during WW II, he first achieved an international critical reputation with the publication of this classic novel in 1946.  The portrait of the detached, unfeeling, uncommitted, amoral, perpetually abstracted Meursault is one of the most haunting in 20th century literature.  For many, it is the supreme 20th century literary depiction of nihilism.  Unquestionably it is one of the premier literary efforts of the century, though Camus managed several other books just as powerful and superb in their own way, in particular THE PLAGUE, THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS, and THE FALL.<br />Meursault reminds me so much of figures from the paintings of Manet.  In painting after painting, Manet depicted individuals alone in crowds, failing or refusing to interact or even acknowledge the others in the frame.  In one famous painting, a lower middle class girl sits alone in her own little orb, sitting beside an upper class gentleman, neither acknowledging the existence of the other, both self-contained, seemingly detached from the busy world surrounding them.  Behind them, a barmaid drinks a beer, equally oblivious to everyone and everything around her.  They might all be on separate desert islands.  Manet repeats this in painting after painting.  Meursault seems almost as if he had stepped out of one of those paintings.  He can at least communicate with others, socialize with them, but he cannot express strong moral sentiments or develop affectionate (as opposed to sexual) attachments.<br />This is not a happy book.  The story deals with Meursault's almost accidental killing of an Arab whose sister had been harmed by one of his acquaintances, but the novel trivializes everything--the killing, his subsequent arrest, his imprisonment, his trial and conviction, and his sentencing.  The closest the novel comes to a happy sentiment is near the end when Meursault imagines how much nicer it would be to witness an execution rather than be executed, to have to puke in revulsion than to literally lose one's head to the guillotine.<br />Camus would never write such a despairing book again.  THE PLAGUE the next year would come close, but not close, while THE FALL would seem almost optimistic and upbeat in comparison.  But for those who want to find perhaps the quintessential expression of what we like to think of as existentialism, this could stand as the premier literary instance.sault imagines how much nicer it would be to witness an execution rather than be executed, to have to puke in revulsion than to literally lose one's head to the guillotine.  <br />Camus would never write such a despairing book again.

B000002UWP|5.0|I think it was very hard to follow up the Great \\"Look Sharp\\" album; but judging by this album, for Per Gessle it was not that hard. He simply takes the listener on an Ultimate \\"Joyride\\", filled to the brim with some of the Wildest and Catchiest Melody Hooks.<br />This is definitley one of the Greatest 80's Pop/Rock/Dance albums. It's Hit after Hit after Hit from first track to the last, with songs that for me never get old. Simply a Must-Have in any Pop CD Collection.<br />Great Catchy Dance songs, with Irresistible Melody Hooks, Guitar Riffs, Techno Beats, and Vocals that immediately pick up your spirits.<br />All songs here are Nothing less than Perfect. They range from Fast Dance of:<br />\\"Joyride\\"<BR>\\"Things will never be the Same\\" - Simply a Breathtaking Song, Beyond Words!<BR>\\"Hotblooded\\"<BR>\\"Small Talk\\"<BR>\\"Knockin' on Every Door\\"<BR>\\"Big L\\"<BR>\\"Physical Fascination\\"<BR>\\"Soul Deep\\"<br />to the most Beautiful Slower Love Ballads like :<BR> <BR>\\"Fading Like a Flower\\" <BR>\\"Spending My Time\\" - Awesome and Powerful!<BR>\\"Perfect Day\\" - <BR>\\"Watercolors in the Rain\\"<BR>\\"Do You Get Excited?\\" (this one is slow at first, but then it gets some Powerful Guitars, it sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it.

B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has never compromised or sold out, and the end result is amazing.  Riot Act is one of the most musically complex and rockin' albums out today.  The lyrics are very inteligent as well.  If you like the coporate rock spewing out of top 40 Radio wanna-be's, then don't buy this record.  However, if you are dying to hear something original and exciting Riot Act has your name on it.
0767002652|5.0|This series holds up well after all these years.  Sure, there are some minor problems with creaky dollys, hearing the camera tape rolling--hey, this was 1971 and it was a low budget make!  But even with that it's a wonderful look at Edwardian England.  Some of the best writing on either side of the &quot;Big Pond.&quot;  By far, this is one of the best series out there.
0792423313|5.0|Prelude to Foundation by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific science fiction writers of all time, is a prologue to his most acclaimed series, The Foundation Trilogy. The book traces the adventures Hari Seldon, a young mathematician who thinks he may have discovered a way to predict the future. Hari call his theory psychohistory, it is based in part on the Chaos theory and lots and lots of math. The one downside is that it can only foresee the future of a large population, so it cannot forecast, for example, the next days events for a particular person. Hari goes to Trantor, the capital of the Galactic Empire to attend a conference to present his ideas. Haris ideas catches Cleon I s eye and he suddenly becomes the most wanted man in the universe and is soon running and hiding from the imperial guards. He explores the terrain of Trantor in the process, looking at different civilizations and further perfecting his theory on psychohistory. <BR> I find this book to be really intriguing and interesting, even though its better to have read The Foundation Trilogy before reading the prelude, because there are many allusions and references that new readers might not understand. This book however, still stands very well on its own as an individual book and not part of a series. Asimov is great in character development, bringing all the characters to life with a depth in their thinking. This book is also pretty fast paced compared to some of the other Asimov books Ive read. Since Asimov wrote this book more than 20 years after The Foundation Trilogy, he has more time thinking everything through and therefore this book was more smooth and easier and more likeable to read. Asimov has also tied most of his major series together, including the Robot series and the Foundation series, along with other novels, so this book also acts as a bridge between works. Overall, the book is really good and I would recommend it to anybody just looking for a good book to read.
0553573403|5.0|This is a very well written, fabulous opening book, and the series justs keeps getting better also. Great subplots and twists that will have any reader completely taken by surprise. However, if you only like books where the good characters always survive and evil perishes, you had better choose a different series to read. I Highly recommend this series to any fantasy lover.

The book traces the adventures Hari Seldon, a young mathematician who thinks he may have discovered a way to predict the future. Hari call his theory psychohistory, it is based in part on the Chaos theory and lots and lots of math. The one downside is that it can only foresee the future of a large population, so it cannot forecast, for example, the next days events for a particular person. Hari goes to Trantor, the capital of the Galactic Empire to attend a conference to present his ideas. Haris ideas catches Cleon I s eye and he suddenly becomes the most wanted man in the universe and is soon running and hiding from the imperial guards. He explores the terrain of Trantor in the process, looking at different civilizations and further perfecting his theory on psychohistory. <BR> I find this book to be really intriguing and interesting, even though its better to have read The Foundation Trilogy before reading the prelude, because there are many allusions and references that new readers might not understand. This book however, still stands very well on its own as an individual book and not part of a series. Asimov is great in character development, bringing all the characters to life with a depth in their thinking. This book is also pretty fast paced compared to some of the other Asimov books Ive read. Since Asimov wrote this book more than 20 years after The Foundation Trilogy, he has more time thinking everything through and therefore this book was more smooth and easier and more likeable to read. Asimov has also tied most of his major series together, including the Robot series and the Foundation series, along with other novels, so this book also acts as a bridge between works. Overall, the book is really good and I would recommend it to anybody just looking for a good book to read.
6303022901|2.0|when i read the book as a little girl, i thought that it was wonderful...<br />yet, some things should be marked &quot;handled with care&quot; when being made into movies....<br />this movie was a HUGE disappointment. the actors themselves were wonderful, but they had little to work with....<br />by skipping many parts and changing others, they've basically lost a big part of the book. it's gone from a touching reflection of the lives of chinese women to just plain cheap sensation. sure the story was &quot;touching enough&quot;.....but WHAT a disappointment.<br />but hey, what can i say? it was a long book. and some things are too complex for the 2-D movie screen.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Just because the artist of this CD is Britney Spears the one-star reviews here are so very biased and pointless and also very misleading to someone who is deciding whether to buy the CD or not. This is not some kind of forum where you discuss how much you hate her or how much you love her. <BR>Reviews that go like - 'Her time is up thankfully' have obviously not listened to the CD. Because if you've hated her from the beginning, this CD is completely different from her old bubblegum stuff so this is the sort of music Anti-Britney fans will like. If you're a fan of old Britney music, you will like this CD because of Shadow, Brave new Girl and Everytime. Everytime and Toxic are like all-time favourite songs. If you don't like her old music and her new music, you're obviously a rock fan or classical music fan (What's that Norah Jones female for?). That means you should not have given this CD a try just so that you can right a crappy review about how bad it is. <BR>Now, for those pop, rnb, hiphop fans - Buy this one. I'm sure there's something in here that you'll like. I liked every song in here but not at first. At first I liked Showdown, Breathe on me, Toxic, Shadow, Brave new girl and Everytime. But after a couple of listens the rest of the songs catch on to you. Boom boom, Outrageous, Touch of my hand and Hook up are very catchy songs. Early morning is the only track on the album which didn't really catch my attention. Matm and the remix are good tracks and I love the remix a lot. <BR>This one is for those who enjoy good pop and hiphop music. Her voice isn't very good. It isn't as terrible as people claim it to be especially on this CD. She isn't singing nasally anymore and that is a whole lot better. <BR>I advise you to try it and give it about three listens before coming down here and posting the trashy reviews
B00005JMJ4|1.0|One of the most boring movies I have ever watched.  When it was finished my wife and I looked at each other and said &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;.  I would only recommend this if you were having a hard time sleeping and need something to help you doze off.  HORRIBLE!!
0385504209|5.0|I try to read many different kinds of books, but rarely read blockbuster best sellers because they are so formulaic.  Based on a recommendation, I read this one and was pleasantly surprised.  Now keep in mind, this is no great work of literature.  It is what it is.  A fast paced thriller with twists and turns and lots of adventure.  While I do not profess to be an art or religion expert, it seemed to be well researched.  This books was just plain fun, a great read for the plane or on the beach.  You get hooked quickly and its hard to put down.  You'll love it!
B000003TAW|4.0|This is a great debut, and was probably needed in 1994. Grunge had been dominating, and I think people were ready for bands like &quot;Green Day&quot;, &quot;No Doubt&quot;, and &quot;Weezer&quot; to come along. Track after track on here is just good catchy alt-rock. The hits were &quot;Undone-The Sweater Song&quot;, &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;, and &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, but the other songs are just as great. They've released a few albums since, but I suspect this one (the blue album) is their best. If nothing else, get it for the quality lyrics like, &quot;What's with these homies dissin' my girl, why do they gotta front&quot;.

B000000OR9|5.0|I've had this album since 1988, and it still gets heavy rotation in my CD player to this day!  The riffs and melodies are infectious, as are John Sykes' strong vocals.  There's no filler in this album, as all the songs are catchy.<br />Riot rocks, Sex Child is sexy, Valley of the Kings is a killer epic, Jelly Roll is fun, Blue Murder as a remider to the band, Out of Love is pure cryin' beauty, Billy comes hard and heavy, Ptolemy is archaic melody, and Black-Hearted Woman finishes off a bombastic album.  Check it out!
B0000A36J5|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition Gift Pack is a fantastic DVD boxed set and a brilliant tribute to the genius of JRR Tolkien.<br />I will start by reviewing the film itself. While I thoroughly enjoyed The Two Towers theatrical edition, the extended edition is even better. <br />The story, while a slight departure from the books, is nothing short of genius. Integrating three distinct and complex story lines into one film is a fantastic achievement on the part of Peter Jackson and his writing team. It follows on directly from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, with each group of characters now having seperate but related adventures throughout Middle-Earth.<br />The film features some of the most talented actors of our age, people like Elijah Wood, Sir Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee, to name just a few. One person worth special mention is Andy Serkis, who plays Gollum, and does a fantastic role with this complicated character.<br />The camera work in the films is also extraordinary, and features some truly magnificent photography of the NZ landscape, while keeping the film in line with what Tolkien wrote in his books.<br />But the real gold of the extended edition is just that, the extended scenes. These scenes help to reinforce and add more depth to the various scenes in the theatrical edition, expanding the story and, in some parts, paying tribute to parts of the books that were absent from the films.<br />For myself, the most enjoyable extended scene was a flashback that Faramir has of Boromir, to a time when Boromir led the forces of Gondor in retaking Osgiliath. To see the Boromir-Faramir-Denethor dynamic in play is something very special indeed. The scene also helps to explain why Boromir was seduced by the Ring in the first film.<br />The behind the scenes part of this DVD set (2 discs worth) are also well worth watching. The Lord of the Rings represents a pioneering effort in film-making, and to see how it was all done is fascinating. Some of the most interesting documentaries concerned the computer animation aspects of the film, and the way that computer programs were designed to simulate realistic  battles on a huge scale, with each participant responding like a real person would. These documentaries make for truly fascinating viewing.<br />In addition to the DVD, this set includes a statue of Gollum and an accompanying DVD and booklet. The statue is wonderful, beautifully carved and hand-painted, it really captures Gollum well. The DVD to me seemed to be little more than an advertisement for similar collectible statues, with some of the big name production personnel going into detals of their personal collections, and the company that made the LOTR statuettes going into details about how the statues were made. It seemed like little more than an advertisement to me.<br />To a more trivial point, the overall box itself is beautiful, featuring a lovely picture of Gandalf leading the Rohan cavalry charge at Helm's Deep. I normally don't keep product boxes, but this box was simply too good to throw away, just like the box for the FOTR DVD Gift pack.<br />If you are a Lord of the Rings fan of any description, then this boxed set would be a great purchase. If you can afford it, then I highly recommend you buy it.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi moves slowly at first, but hang in there.  The unfolding story is fascinating but in my opinion did not prove it's point ,that there is a God.  Yann Martel's writings on fear, indecision and religion are spectacular but the story was too vague, perhaps intentionally, to prove it's point.  Great selection for a book club to debate the veracity of each version/ending.  <br />Would highly recommend readers to read an original tale, Max and the Cats by Moacyr Sciliar written in 1981, for a highly entertaining, insightful and focused story in the same vein. I would have given Life of Pi 4 stars until I read that story.
B00003CXXR|4.0|I did not see this movie when it came out. In fact, I SWORE off any more Jurassic Park movies after the abominably BAD Jurassic Park 2-The Lost World.<br />I caught this on ABC TV and was only going to give it a few minutes, but after the opening sequence I was thoroughly hooked. Yes, the plot and story did have plot holes the size of T-Rex, but you had to overlook those.(Case in point: raptors and other predators ONLY show up when the humans are near a facility that they can hide in, etc. If the pteradactyls are caged in a huge bird cage, what were they eating to survive?) But the movie makers made you feel how frightened and vulnerable you'd be by being marooned in a jungle full of big things who want to eat you. I just wish whiny, BIG MOUTHED Tea Leoni would have been eaten right away! I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie and figured I might be having some nightmares after seeing this one.<br />Like I said, it was MUCH better than the previous Jurassic Parks and I thought maybe Steven Spielberg had gotten back on track. Then I saw he DIDN'T direct JP-3 and that was why it was so good. Spielberg has gotten too rich and famous and so full of himself his quality has taken a nose-dive.<br />This one is definitely not for small kids due to all the humans being graphically eaten alive, but for a fast moving, scary movie, rent this one.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye's debut release is certainly more than I had expected, having only previously heard certain freestyles he had done in the past. I wasn't impressed with either of his current mainstream hits (Through the Wire &amp; Slow Jams), although the beats are off the hook for both tracks. The beats all over this album are amazing, and I expected nothing less from this aspect, but there are certain tracks were Kanye really shines lyrically. He actually overshadows Hova himself on 'Never Let Me Down', goes head-to-head with Talib Kweli and Common on 'Get Em High' (on which Kanye spits a furious acapella verse at the beginning of the track, and really shows just how good &quot;conscious&quot; rap can sound on the soulful 'Family Business.' Definitely a CD worth picking up. Only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was because of the filler material.
B00011V8CW|4.0|Finally, you can buy this again...but...okay, the 2cd, 1DVD thing is great for me.  I'm a chump for Bowie and will buy anything he puts out--but this really tested me.  The &quot;documentary&quot; on the DVD is Bowie at his worst-pretentious, boring and self-aggrandizing.  The videos are great, but I bought this for the music.  The remixes are good, but they're remixes.  The actual album is both over and under packaged. The Cds and DVD come in this clunky &quot;De-luxe&quot; type sleeve that is difficult to work with, and in the album,there are no lyrics or liner notes whatsoever.  Annoying.  There should have been a single disc edition just so casual listeners would listen and dig it.  The Cd is worth 20$ just for the singles, especially Jump They Say. 30$ is pricey.  If the DVD drove the price up, then it should have been left out.
0393317552|1.0|Jared Diamond claims that Europeans advanced further than Native American, Asian, African, etc. because the Europeans developed plow-driven farming sooner and thereby developed organized societies sooner. Also Europeans developed immunities through frequent contact with various domestic animals and consequently defeated other peoples by bringing diseases with them. Entirely valid thesis, except that Diamond proceeds to pick any evidence supporting it, and ignores anything that contradicts it.<br />Why did Britain conquer India? Indians were certainly more resistant to diseases in India, had BETTER domestic animals (elephants to pull canons, for instance), and had just as sophisticated social structure. And during the Indian Mutiny their weapons were just as good as the British ones. Yet the outnumbered British prevailed. The central point of Diamond's book is Pizarro's capture of Atahualpa (168 Spaniards against 80,000 Incas). Diamond attributes that stunning victory purely to superior weaponry - ignoring the fact that with 500 to 1 advantage completely unarmed people (and Incas WERE armed, if poorly) can easily swarm armored arquebusiers by sheer mass. Incas were paralyzed by their delusional view of reality - in other words, their CULTURE. And culture seems to be either a dirty world, or a non-existent one to Diamond. He does no even consider that cultural differences, such as tradition of rational inquiry, have anything to do with military victories.<br />The book is rife with such omissions. The Mongols conquered China and half of Europe and they were a nomadic, non-agricultural people. Diamond gives them exactly one sentence (\\"Mongol empire stretched 6,000 miles\\"). African tribal societies had farming and domesticated animals for centuries before the Europeans arrived. China had all the advantages Europe had, yet according to Diamond lost out because (get that!) its smooth coastline allowed no refuge to dissenters from the government that suppressed innovation(and why would it do that?). European coastline is convoluted, so such dissenters could hide. No mention of European governments which encouraged innovation (culture again!) and prospered as a result.<br />As for Diamond's claim early in the book that New Guineans are more intelligent that Westerners, that's just pure racism - especially in view of his repeated claims elsewhere in the book that no humans groups innately differ in intelligence. Except these two, apparently. He thinks that the violence of New Guinean society - that any encounter with a stranger could turn deadly, - bred out the stupid ones. Assuming that is true, one wonders why did New Guineans never grow smart enough to END such violence?<br />Even worse is Diamond's mention of his experiences on a Midwestern farm where all white farmhands were hard-drinking scum, and the only decent person was a Native American. That's just gratuitous white-bashing, so common on liberal college campuses. Without that and the \\"New Guineans must be smarter\\" bit, I would have given the book 2 stars (\\"intriguing idea, poorly executed\\"). As is, it deserves the lowest rating possible.
B0001I562I|5.0|Okay, it's about time.  this dvd has been so overdue.  and i so hope it has at least the theatrical trailer, and widescreen format.  yes it's a cheesy movie. and it has sarah jessica parker with purple hair returning from a twisted sister concert, but it's still good, i remember it vividly when i was very young.  anyway, DISNEY, PLEASE DON'T PUSH BACK THE DATE ON THIS ONE.  WE NEED IT, IT'S IN OUR BLOOD!!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Nora's latest cd is very satisfying listening. Relaxing but with a lot more \\"country\\" in about half the numbers. The only real disapointment is how she ruined \\"what am I to you\\". It was perfect on her DVD (which I love), but she changed the tempo and the notes on this cd. Still I wouldn't consider NOT owning this follow-up on her other wonderful offerings. Thank you to Blue Note Records....look forward to more of this quality.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has a habbit of making amazing records, only to hide them under tons of controversy.  With the war in Iraq just kicking off in high gear, Madonna released \\"American Life.\\"  The debut title track single recieved tons of controvery for it's supposed \\"anti-war\\" message.  While the album debuted at #1 on the charts in many countries including the US, it dropped quickly simply because it could not withstand all the controvery.  Radio did not support the record, and the videos were rarely played on TV.  This exact situation occured in 1992 with the simultaneous release of her \\"Erotica\\" album and \\"Sex\\" book.  Madonna made a really amazing record last year, which had the potential to sell 10 million copies like some of her previous work.  I would reccomend this album to anyone.  If you live in the US you will fall in love with this record.  If the \\"music\\" popular in the states hasn't shrunk your brain enough yet, you will LOVE this record of \\"music with meaning.\\"
B000089RVX|5.0|As a die hard pop music queen, I would have NEVER dreamed of purchasing this album.  My favorite performer is Mariah Carey;  beautiful ballads and similar songs are my preference. Even though I am in my mid-thirties, I find myself purchasing Britney Spears albums and similar pop music.  I also enjoy Charlotte Church and Josh Groban.<br />I have despised any music with even a hint of hard rock/heavy metal my whole life.  While off on disability from my job, I flipped channels frequently. My first &quot;taste&quot; of Evanecence was during that time period.  Amy Lee's voice reaches into the soul.  Her voice is a prime combination of power and a scense of haunting.  I predict great things for Ms. Lee in the future.  She has an amazing talent.  <br />Incidently,I purchased the Josh Groban CD from Amazon at the same time I purchased the Evanescence CD, and have yet to remove it from its packaging. My offical recommendation is to purchase the Evanescence CD immediately, preferably from Amazon.  They have by far the best prices from any online dealer, and don't waste your money going to a store which sells music.  Let the buyer beware: everyone but Amazon has terrribly inflated prices.<br />I hope this provides some helpful information.  Good luck with your purchases.
B000089RVX|1.0|Linkin Park-rap+GOOD singer=still a terrible band. Get your own sound, or at least rip off a better band!
B000089RVR|1.0|She just goes on and on and on. Could somebody ask her to stop and get on with her life! A middle class dancing queen from Islington, a role-model for all those nice 30-somethings working in the City, who really always wanted to work in the music industry- because it is so hip and because theyve once learned to play the piano- but never actually had the courage to as it is so very difficult to give up the lifestyle. And Financial Times. And the prospect of a banker-husband. So now they buy this cd instead. Safe and booooring.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Yes, that is the type of &quot;rage&quot; offered by Linkin Park on the latest release of their extensive career, which has yielded two interchangeable studio albums, a rap-styled remix album, and a ridiculous &quot;tribute&quot; album. Chester Bennington (what a name for a rock star) has THE worst voice in rock today. Alternating between a Timberlake-esque croon and the kind of scream that a five-year-old makes upon having his toy truck taken away by Mommy, he displays a supernatural lack of talent. Mike Shinoda's raps are no better, and are delivered with all the passion of Alan Greenspan reciting economic figures. The &quot;musicians&quot; in the band are horrible at best; can someone tell me if that really is a human being playing drums, or a machine? Not to mention the fact that this album makes no progression upon their first steaming pile of crap, I guess they didn't want to fix the formula that has garnered them so many of those fans who think that Hawt Tawpic is like so totally awesome! Get Black Label Society or Down for some GOOD modern metal.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I had really wanted to see this and I had heard good things about it. It was suspensful and when Darry is stuck in the basement with the bodies that's pretty scary. So is when they were escaping and they were at the house with the lady with all the cats. There was little action and the pyshic was really stupid. Were we supposed to be scared when she was singing. This movie was also really sick at points too. When the lady at the gas station says \\"He was sniffing all your clothes and it looked like he was enjoying it too\\" was nasty and did we have to see him ripping the toungue out of that guy. I wanted to see the cops shoot him so bad. I don't think they should've put all the sick scenes in without putting a stronger plot. The whole movie was really a conversation between Darry and his sister with ten minutes of them running away. This movie was not worthy of a sequel and it was trying to be a Halloween movie or a Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff. Don't put yourself through this hour and a half of stupidity.
B0000028M7|5.0|The early 90s Seattle scene brought us a lot of classic albums, such as Nevermind, Ten, Superunknown, and Badmotorfinger. However, Dirt by Alice in Chains stands above all of those amazing albums as THE masterpiece of grunge rock. The power and emotion of Layne Staley's voice have not been matched, the riffs and solos of Jerry Cantrell have been endlessly imitated, and the rhythm section of Mike Starr and Sean Kinney provided an excellent foundation for the melodic genius of songwriters Staley and Cantrell. These songs have so much more poignancy after Layne's untimely death, which unfortunately was given so little coverage by MTV. This is despite the fact that so many of the bands they play are direct ripoffs of the music of the grunge scene, particularly AIC. Don't read any more reviews, click Buy Now. You WILL NOT regret it. Best songs: They are all good, but Junkhead, Rain when I Die, Angry Chair, and Would? stand out.<BR>   Also, don't pay any attention to what &quot;Fred Dursts Numba One Fan&quot; says. I've read his other reviews, and it's obvious he is joking.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|This movie makes no sense. So what if i didn't understand it, it would still be boring. I can't understand why anyone would like this movie.

B000005JA8|1.0|Let's work together to make sure that no one confuses this with real music...  Pretentious and boring, nonsensical and a colossal waste of time - this is the worst &quot;album&quot; I've ever heard.
B00005JLK1|4.0|This film has a very creepy cover, and I've wanted to see it for a while. It's done by the same producers who did House On Haunted Hill (seen), and Thirteen Ghosts (next up to see!) I enjoyed House On Haunted Hill, and I ended up enjoying this!<br />It starts off very much like a cheap and tacky soap opera, judging by the severely dodgy music and even dodgier curly and PINK font on the credits! I was quite shocked at this, as this isn't your stereotypical way to display all the lovely people who were involved in a movie. And definitely not in PINK!<br />Starting off in 1962, we're soon transported forward in time to the present day, a tried and tested trick in films these days. We're introduced to Gabriel Byrne, the appropriately named \\"Murphy\\" - even though it makes me think of Jack Nicholson's character in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.<br />Full of scary ghosts, and a bratty little girl, who keeps appearing alive and scaring Julianna Margulies shipless. Either I didn't get it, or it never really explains why all the other characters on the ship are dead, and she appears seemingly alive, although she is a ghost. I probably didn't get it, knowing me.<br />A lot of scenes featuring the ghost ship and other certain parts seem stolen from another great film about a ship - Titanic of course. One particular scene at the end, where Julianna Margulies is lying on a piece of wreckage, is very similar to Kate Winslet lying on a piece of wreckage! The whole storyline made little bells start ringing, as it's the story of the Marie Celeste (the ship which disappeared and then reappeared, with no crew or passengers on it), just extended. Murphy even mentions the Marie Celeste during the movie.<br />The finale is just simply unsatisfying. It's left almost hanging, and it ruined the whole movie for me, and it seems that there may or may not be a sequel - it seems as if the underlying storyline could keep recurring. I'd rather it wouldn't seem that the whole story could recur. You'll know what I mean when you see the film. It's a favourite in film, particularly in horror movies, for people to be shot, burnt, blown up - and then appear alive.<br />This is one of the scariest movies I've seen this year, and although I like scary movies, it's not one I would watch again - simply because it was too scary for little frightened old me. It's definitely a keeper though, to watch again when you're in the mood for a toe curling scary film.. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.

B0000DD7LC|5.0|I truly believe that \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" is far superior to her first album. I love every single song on this CD. Alicia set the bar high with SIAM and exceeded my expectations with her second album.<br />Alicia leaves nothing to chance. Each song is polished and refined. She has reshaped R&B artistically and vocally. No one does it better. This CD is a must for any TRUE R&B collector. It will only get better with time.<br />Standout Tracks: Karma, Diary, So Simple, Samsonite Man, and Nobody Not Really.
1400034779|5.0|I highly recommend that you read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, by Alexander McCall Smith.  The author was born in Africa, taught law at University of Botswana and is a professor of medical law at Edinburgh University.  I feel confident he draws a realistic picture of life in Botswana.  It is one of the emerging African nations, a landlocked country about the size of Texas, located just above South Africa.  The Kalahari is right next-door.<br />The author writes about Africa as seen through the loving eyes of Mma Precious Ramotswe, who establishes the first detective agency in Botswana. This is a business she feels will fill a need in the community because people are always wanting to know something.<br />Mma Ramotswe is proud of her country, proud of the first President of her country even though no one remembers him now.  Mma Ramotswe is about 35 years old when we meet her--a very likeable woman in control of her life.  She is a fine figure of an African woman, not one of these skinny sticks of girls you see nowadays (in her words).<br />The clients who come to her agency each have a story of his or her own.  They are told in a simple and direct way and are all the more powerful for their simplicity.  For instance: an old man shows up claiming to be a woman's long lost Daddy.

B00005JMFO|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, which is strange because I normally don't go for romantic comedies. However, this movie more than holds up.
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA has clocked this one with lyrics &amp; Rza (Razor Sharp) has planted the beats of a legend.No Doubt this is the best Hip Hop album of all time!No Lie!Get this be a member of true hiphop.Old school rules No LOVE 4 THE COMMERCIAL SCENE!!LOVE THE OLDSCHOOL UNDERGROUND SOUND!!!!
B000067CPX|4.0|The Chili Peppers have evolved again on this album and for any band to stay worthy that is what they must do.  There are four solid muscians behind every track on this album and it shows on songs that stretch the band further like Carbron, Tear, and a solid ending number in Venice Queen.  More backing vocals are present throughout the album, but classic Pepper trademarks remain.  Flea is as good as ever and John shows his more mellow side with some quite beautiful guitar work.  Chad has the drums pounding a solid rythym behind most every song and Anthony's new attempts at singing and truly heart-felt lyrics, while odd at first, seem right by the end.  I can't possibly see anyone hating this album, but I can fully understand forgetting it for a few months, like I did.  For some reason when I think of albums I need to listen to, this one just doesn't pop into mind, still a great album though, I can think of very few albums worth five stars anyway.  Buy it, enjoy it, and thank the Chili Peppers for finding a way to stick around for so long, they truly are one of the greatest bands of our time.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's rare that a film can say so much about human nature without spoon-feeding the predictable. If you're expecting a typical hollywood script, you may be disappointed.<br />Coppola sets up nice contrasts between sexuality, intimacy, romance and friendship.  She also creates an interesting tension through the age difference of the leads - again without forcing the issue.<br />There is no tidy closure but there is resolution.  It's refreshing how the director leaves key moments to the imagination - allowing for a individual interpretation of the characters and story. Compare the ending with a sappy hit like You've Got Mail.  What did Bob say to Charlotte, exactly?  Only you know for sure.  But we all know it wasn't, \\"Don't cry, Shop Girl.\\"
B00000J2PH|5.0|I won't wax rhapsodic about this album, because that's been done here several times already.  But it is indeed a classic, for several reasons.  First, it was a watershed for King, who had written so many great songs for others throughout the 60's.  Second, it was one of the first of the true singer-songwriter albums, along with James Taylor's &lt;i&gt;Sweet Baby James&lt;/i&gt;, and Joni Mitchell before that.  Third, it was one of those &quot;rite-of-passage&quot; albums for any of us coming of age in the early 70's. And finally, every song here is a true gem, either classics already made famous by other artists, or new songs about to become classics.  King has always had a soulful, heartfelt style that has never been as evident as it is here.  The bonus CD tracks are interesting but really don't add much to what is already a perfect album.  This is an essential recording for any pop music fan.
055357342X|5.0|George R.R. Martin is an infuriating man.  As I read his Song of Ice and Fire, some of my favorite characters keep getting killed.  Others prove to not be as admirable as I thought, and still others are not as worthless or evil as I first perceived.  In other words, it is a phenomenal thrill ride that I couldn't get off if I tried.  This series has more purely gut-wrenching, stay-up-late-to-finish power than anything I have read since Stephen King's It.  I don't know how Mr. Martin keeps everything straight.  I want to scream at him for taking so long to produce A Feast For Crows.  But I will be in line as soon as it comes out, waiting to snap it up and read, reread, and marvel at it.<br />The best thing these books do is to mirror the human condition.  The vast majority of us are neither good nor evil, but in some gray area.  Martin recognizes this and makes it maddeningly hard to choose your &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;villains.&quot;  The violence can be graphic, but it's a hard old medieval world.  The first book in this series was difficult for me to get into, but the ride gets better with each installment.  Write faster, George, please!<br />I read a lot of fantasy, and there is some good writing out there.  But in my opinion, this series supersedes anything currently out there, with the possible exception of the Dark Tower series, and wouldn't THAT make for an interesting debate.<br />Troy

B000002IM7|3.0|Out Of The Silent Planet is the debut album from King's X and hints at the greatness they'd achieve on their next album Gretchen Goes To Nebraska. The album has a very raw production, the guitars are crunchier than on their future releases, and their trademark harmonies are at their infancy. As evidenced of their inclusion on the Best Of King's X album, \\"Goldilox\\" and \\"King\\" are the best tracks here and point to the direction of their next two albums. The opening \\"In the New Age\\" is both atmospheric and heavy and has a great guitar solo from Ty Tabor. \\"Visions\\" is also a very strong track and its jam sounds like a prelude to the future tracks \\"Moanjam\\" and \\"Chariot Song.\\" The rest of the songs are all decent but nothing great as \\"Wonder\\" and \\"What Is This\\" are very similar songs with the latter is funkier while \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Power Of Love\\" and \\"Shot Of Love\\" are straightforward rockers save for the gospel like choruses. All told, this is a decent debut but it is one of their weaker albums only because almost everything after this is first rate. Their next release, Gretchen Goes to Nebraska, is arguably their finest with 1994's Dogman coming very close.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Even after seven years I still see that this movie is still loved by many and is held on high. I admit, when it first came out, I liked it, only because I was a young teenager that didn't know the difference between a true masterpiece and something like this. Now that I look back on it, I begin to wonder how something like this can be taken to heart. When you look at it, you begin to wonder how somebody like James Cameron ever took on the role, when he had such a wonderful resume already with amazing films like &quot;The Abyss.&quot; Now that film in itself is worth watching over and over. This however, after the first hour, you begin to wonder what you are watching. Is it a movie about a true event or just some fantasy world for little teenagers to enjoy. It's pretty sad when you base your likings on a movie just because two young stars are in it. No matter how bad their acting really is. I only wish that &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; won that year, but not too suprisingly, this for some reason was voted better by the Academy. Hopefully, this year they'll choose well in their awarding of Best Picture.
B000001Y79|5.0|I just love Tragic Kingdom it has to be the best No Doubt album to date. It has four great singles Spiderweb, Just A Girl, Sunday Morning, and Don't Speak. This has to be the best album of the 90's and of '95 if you ask me. The whole album is a true rock album so don't think twice about getting this album because you might just miss out on a great thing. If you are looking for a great rock album it has to be No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom. Put this one in your collection today or you might miss out on a real true rock album.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|Errol Morris did his homework for this movie.  20 hours of film and tape.  The music by Philip Glass is outstanding.  The film, the interaction in the first person, the archival footage, some in three dimensions are mind boggling.  The music is very unique and original.  The messages are clear.  In war the human mind cannot comprehend the complexities.  \\"How much evil must we do, to do good?\\"  Having assisted in the production of the film, I know how hard everyone worked to make this unforgetable film.  It should be required viewing for all military and flag officer candidates as well as all presidential candidates.  SEE IT.  It is worth every minute.  Even if you are too young to remember Vietnam.  Even if you served in Vietnam and hate Mr. McNamara.  You need to see this important film.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|When there is smoke then there must be fire!  Alicia, baby where is the fire.  After a memorable first album, the truth comes out. I am sure we are soon going to find out shes the new Milli Vanilli. She has become the Celine Dion of the Hip Hop/R &amp; B world.  Sure, we think she can sing, but nothings coming out. I am sure if we pull make the curtain, we will find a slew of over rated record honchos pulling strings.  Lets face it, many artist have looks, that doesn't mean she has talent (and are we sure shes a lady?)  Now, Paula Abdul thats talent.  She can dance &amp; sing and boy is she easy on the  eyes.  I can't believe she has to work with no talents like Rands and that english geek, Simon.  They would not know talent, if it bit their dairy aire.  Why give all those want-a-bes a rest and give the show over to PAULA! PAULAl! PAULA! Boy, if I was the real President and not some wanabe from a cheap Tom Clancy novel, I would press the button and send Simon and the Gang back to the fish and chip shack where he belongs. Oh, and take Alicia bopecia with him!
B00004XPPB|5.0|Another Depp Classic. He plays a man who is in the FBI who has to go undercover in the mob. Its like 21 Jumpstreet but all grown up!
B00001U0DP|1.0|I hate this movie! Absolutely hate it! I'm sorry, but I can find absolutely nothing funny about life in World War II concentration camps or especially about the Holocaust. Nothing! To attempt to make light of such subjects insults the very memory of all who suffered so greatly.<br />The movie as it stands is sappy and predictable and intelligent viewers will see right through it, it's cast and it's goal as a pathetic tear-jerker.<br />THE HORSEMAN
0780631684|4.0|This was a very good film with a unique cast and original plot.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|A GREAT PIECE OF WRITING, GREAT ACTING WHICH I ENJOYED, BUT THE PACE OF THIS IS TOO SLOW.  AT TIMES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE RUNNING YOUR VCR IS IN SLOW MOTION. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR, BUT A FILM THAT SHOULD BE WATCHED ON VIDEO.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is exactly what real Zep fans have waited for for years. The Song Remains the Same Soundtrack was good - but an 8 track could never capture Zeppelin live at its finest. It took 3 CD's. If you are even a moderate fan of Zeppelin, or of Rock at all, this CD is a must. The power, feeling, and raw emotion that today's rock is lacking is all there. My personal favorite: 9-minute (ish), electric version of the classic &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away.&quot; My only disappointment: &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot; nowhere to be found. (But they probably didn't play them in these 2 concerts.)<br />The DVD is also a must.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I was expecting crap, but this is decent. The actors are good in their roles and there's plenty of action and lots of good moments. The CGI sucks so you've been warned. Affleck played a comic book artist in Chasing Amy so I thought it was interesting to see him as a comic book hero. Affleck wants Kevin Smith to work on the sequel and it'd be cool if Smith wrote it, but I guess we'll have to see. I wont hold my breath, but it's a good idea.
B000002JSP|4.0|This album is so different from anything that had been done before, and especially from anything that this band had done before (all classics). It represents a total shift in direction - Led Zeppelin would never rely on any one sound. If you listen and use your brain, you'll realize this album was the precursor to the 80's - and that John Paul Jones was the most underrated member of this group.<BR>If you have rock or Zep albums this one is a must. See musical diversity at its finest when the greatest hard rock band goes 80's, soft, synth-rock, bluegrass and blues in the same album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ok, I got this alum expecting big stars with Kanye on each song, using this star power to make a great album. While there are a few stars on the album (Jay z, Luda, Twista) Kanye could have done this alone. While there are too many interluds and missing some great Kanye tracks (DOWNLOAD My Way and Home - 5 star songs that should be on the album), this album delivers for me and Im sure everyone who got the album. You can listen to it #1 thru 21 even with all the interludes. Buy this album caquse it is guaranteed to be up there with the top 10 rap albums at the end of the year. Also, if you are deciding between this and Twista's Kamikaze because you want an album with Slow Jams on it. GET THIS ONE. A much better album that you won't have to skip songs on.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Yes, its true. Linkin Park has been one of my top favorite bands for a long time, but suddenly one day it hit me: all their songs sound the same, their lyrics are boring, and their just overrated. Honestly I cant walk around school without hearing &quot;YO DAWG LINKIN PARK IZ DA BOMB!&quot; or &quot;OMG LINKIN PARK IS SOOOO COOL&quot;, their not that good. There are some cool parts in their songs though that display lots of energy, which is why I started to like them in the first place. This isn't heavy metal like the craptastic Slipknot or Mudvayne, etc. No, its a more sensible, creative, artistic and fun to listen to kind of metal. In other words its BETTER than that kind of metal. And all these people are calling LP a boyband, why? Just because theirs females that think Chester and Mike are &quot;hawt&quot; or whatever and they have soft voices sometimes does NOT make them a boyband by any means, same thing with Good Charlotte who is also called a boyband alot. In order to be a boyband, they would have to not write any of their songs, not play their instruments, and they would have to dance around and have ALL of them sing at the same time. So LP is still one of my favorite bands, but its just their so overrated that I cant help but at least take a star away. I'd give this CD a 3.5, their other one is better though.
B000000OAN|5.0|When people think of queen, Bohemian Rhapsody must follow. There are 11 great songs on this CD. &quot;Death on Two Legs (dedicated to...)&quot; was written for the band's old manager who cheated them. It's powerful and fun to sing along to. &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon...&quot; is only about 1 minute long, but is contaigious and completely a happy tune. &quot;I'm in Love With my Car&quot; is interesting, because it is sung by Roger Taylor. I think he has a great voice, and I love when he sings. The song is made for any American boy who loves their ride more than their chick! &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot; was written by John Deacon and is a loving and sweet song. No negative energy in this one! &quot;'39&quot; is sung by Brian May, who also has a wonderful voice, very soft. In fact, I've never heard John Deacon sing by himself, but the other three band members have fabulous and unique voices. It's a folky kind of song, with a singable chorus. <BR>    &quot;Sweet Lady&quot; brings Queen back to their rock roots, with a simple but great guitar lead throughout it. One of my favorite songs on the album is &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;, a chipper and funny song, with great vocals by Freddie. It is a complete riot, but at the same time, so catchy. &quot;The Prophet's Song&quot;is 8 and 1/2 minutes long, but super powerful! For anyone who loves the queen opera type songs, this will be a fave. &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, is, in my opinion, one of the best love songs written. Freddie's beautiful angelic voice is enough to make you cry. He is so full of beauty and charisma, and this song proves it. It is a piano ballad, which are always beautiful. &quot;Good Company&quot; is another Brian May song, with great vocals and an interesting choice of words. Not deep at all, but fun to sing to. <BR>     Last, but certainly not least by any means, the great &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. I knew all the words to this song when I was 7, and I didn't even know who Queen was!But I loved it, and I still love it today. I think it's great because it is very difficult to know what the song is truly about. Freddie never told the public what the song was about, and I love that, because you can interprit it to fit your own life. This song was made popular because of the SNL classic &quot;Wayne's World&quot;, and America finally got to hear the song Britain had known about for years. It is one of the best songs in history, and is even in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the most requested song ever. <BR>     The last 3 songs on the record are the electric guitar version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and digitally remastered versions of &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot;, and &quot;I'm in Love with My Car.&quot; This album is probably the best Queen album and is one of my favorites. I should mention I am a 16 year old girl, and my friends all make fun of me, while they're listening to rap and punk. I don't care, though, because I love Queen, I love Freddie, Roger, Brian, and John, and QUEEN is the love of my life!!!
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I saw Gavin Degraw opening up for Barenaked Ladies, and he is quite amazing. His live show blew me away.<br />Sadly, a lot of the energy from the live show is just missing on the album. I think the song that suffered the most is &quot;Just Friends&quot;, but I have to give the whole thing a few more listens before I decide that for sure.<br />It's a good solid album, one that I'm happy to own. Now if he can just figure out how to capture some of his live energy on a CD, he'd be #1 in no time!
B00005RYL9|5.0|First, I must confess that I rented the movie because my favorite music group, Queen, was doing the soundtrack. But, unlike  Flash Gordon, this movie actually has Queen songs right in it! But, as I watched this movie, I began to get really involved in the story. Christopher Lambert(who, in my opinion, is really hot in this movie!) plays Conner Macleod, a Scottish warrior who has been alive for over 300 years. He has come to NYC to battle the last remaining immortals, for there can be only one! The guy who plays Kurgan freaked the sh*t out of me! He was generally scary! I think one of the reasons I loved this movie was because of the underlying love story. I almost cried when Nash lit the candle in the church! Anyway, if you love Queen as much as I do, you'll love to hear their music throughout the movie. Even if you don't like Queen (I can't imagine why you wouldn't, but...), you'll love this winding tale of horror, love, and a kind of magic!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation was a breath of fresh air from the usual prefab Hollywood Glitz.  It was great to see such a mainstream actor like Bill Murray in this type of role.  This movie focused on what many frequent business travelers feel when they are always on the road from their wife and kids.  They are &quot;lost&quot; in the figurative sense and in the literal sense.  In this movie, Murray meets the lovely Johansson along the way who is also lost.  Together the two have great dialogue and do a little bit in the way of &quot;finding&quot; themselves.<br />What was so great about this movie was how true it is to real life.  Strangers don't typically hop into bed together with reckless abandon, and when people are making choices there concsience always plays a part in the decision.  In this movie, you can really see the battling of Murray and Johasson with their innerselves.  They want to take a particular course of action, but yet they know in their heart that it isn't the proper course.<br />Sofia Coppola showed a very strong effort in her sophomore film.  With this promising film, hopefully many more great things are on the way from her.

2266079999|4.0|The classic science fiction theme of humanities' first brush with alien intelligence occupies center stage in Sagan's adequate, but not artful, novel.  <br />First the bad: In terms of literary style, \\"Contact\\" isn't especially impressive. Indeed, the prose is often awkward and this tends to give the characters a dry, not-quite-believable quality.  \\"Contact\\" borders on the verbose---I am confident at least 50 pages worth of dialogue and \\"character development\\" could easily (and beneficially) been omitted. I'm sorry to say that after about 150 pages I very nearly lost all interest in the book. I'm glad I persevered however, because the last half was worth it. And on that note......<br />The good: The scientific foundation and superstructure Sagan builds in this book is solid, credible, believable and interesting to read.  Sagan has described a perfectly plausible and substantial \\"real world\\" scenario for first contact.  As already mentioned, the second half of the book is where the real strength lies.  Sagan takes themes and characters that were rather boring and predictable in the first half and actually makes them interesting, and thankfully, even thought-provoking. For example, I enjoyed the irony of Dr. Arroway having to defend her experience in the Machine vis a vis her antagonism toward other people's religious experiences. Dr. Arroway became a more believable and interesting character in the second half, some situations in her personal life approaching poignancy were very effective in that regard.  The completion of the Machine is interesting enough, as well as its subsequent use.   All told, \\"Contact\\" finishes strong---read it for yourself and decide!
B000062YAZ|2.0|Slayer is a bunch of party-guys who have trained hard at playing their thrashy guitars. They are as fast on this album as they probably are on their feet chasing around after girls on the beach. And the singer delivers the dark lyrics with a soft voice, probably calculated to reach a wider audience. Not much of personality in the music; and they have stolen parts from other records, like Death's Leprosy and Megadeth's Peace Sells for example, records with real artistic value. <BR>If you want good metal try Symbolic, Sound of Perseverance, and Human by Death.
B000002IPZ|4.0|Often rrrrripped apart for being \\"too rushed\\" and \\"full of filler\\", Souls Of Black isn't considered an essential Testament recording.  No, it sure doesn't kick you in the teeth like The Legacy, but I honestly can't say I'm very disappointed by this album.  I don't see where all the \\"filler\\" is-I don't skip over any songs when I listen to it.  Sure, they're not all masterpieces, but to my ears, they're all listenable.  To each his own I suppose.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Start with the reviews here that found this to be boring and pointless.I can ralate that to you hoping that youre car  runs out of gas,to have some adventure.I really cant understand that viewpoint,always waiting for something to always happen.My friends girl said halfway through the movie,\\"Arent they going to make out or something?\\" Yeah,shes not to smart.She was needing for something to happen that she could clearly understand,yet it didnt,so she didnt like it.<br />   This is one of the best movies I have seen.Its the kind of picture that will probably stay with you forever,like a part of youre own life.It is so good  because it captures some of the most honest moments that are only caught once,just this one time,and you can see that,and miss it the minute its over.Just like a day in someones life,it happens one time,and thats it! .Its a translation that stands all alone, so damn thoughtful,it makes me a little sad when I think about it.Its about the moments,each and every one of them.All of them.
B000002ITM|4.0|I consider myself a big Testament fan, and I wouldn't have given them the time of day if it hadn't have been for this album.  I know most Testament fans bought this and after listening to it, turned it into a coaster on their coffee table.  Looking back, I think this album is pretty good after all these years.  Yeah, Testament seemed to be trying to do a \\"black album\\" of their own.  Once the 90s hit, Testament started a habit of following metal trends.  Luckily they never went nu-metal or went Metallica.  The Ritual is softer I must say.  It doesn't have all the speedy thrashy tunes you've come to expect from Testament, but more heavy, mid-paced metal songs.  And although people criticize testament for trying to go mainstream or poppy with this one, I really can't see any of these songs as singles.  But then again, in the early 90s we had \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\", so I guess there could have been room for \\"Electric Crown.\\"  All in all, not Testament's best, but it has to be somewhat good coz it was enough for me to want to explore the band further.
B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Matthews Band attracts a devoted following, but I'm not part of that following.  I generally find his music too introspective for my tastes.  However, I felt compelled to give this album five stars based on the presence of just one song, Two Step.  I can't count how many times I have listened to this song, and every time I marvel all over again at its rich complexity, and how integral to the whole each note is.  In my considered opinion, this is the finest three-plus minutes of popular music I have ever heard.
0739308688|5.0|a game of thrones is actually original, something that makes it especially compelling considering the rest of the relatively similar fantasy epics out there right now. the plot is intricate, but interesting and unexpected. without giving too much away, people actually die. the twists and turns are NOT predictable, people are not who they seem, and every aspect of this wonderful novel is carefully calculated by this genius author. although the multiple viewpoint style that martin employs to tell the story might annoy some people, i found that even for the people i really and truly disliked, the prose was compelling enough to hold my attention. the story is loosely based on the war of the roses, but dont expect it to be a rehashing of those actual events. the only real complaint i have about a song of fire and ice is the lengthy waiting period between books. if you cant stand not knowing what will happen, i suggest you wait until all the books are published (but till then, youll be missing out on one of the best fantasy series of all time--and thats not an exaggeration)
B000000OA6|4.0|Innuendo is such an innovative and subtly layered CD, that every time I listen to it, I shake my head and wonder what other great creations we might have had if Freddy Mercury were still alive.  Queen had elevated their panache in every category of style.  The rocker &quot;Headlong&quot; is similar to earlier hits like &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and &quot;Hammer To Fall,&quot; but it is far more polished and invasive to the ears.  The title track is bizarre, and unusually dark for Queen, yet a rich orchestration of each members' talents.  &quot;The Show Must Go&quot; is eerily haunting, a foreshadowing of November 24, 1991--the year Freddy Mercury passed away.  He had a voice that has proven to be irreplaceable.  <br />You cannot be a fan of early Queen and miss this last offering.  Even its misses are enjoyable in their own quirky way.  Songs like &quot;All God's People&quot; and &quot;Delilah&quot; just out-and-out stink; yet they reveal the exploratory nature of Queen, who seemed to simply enjoy creating (think &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody,&quot; &quot;Flash,&quot; and &quot;One Vision&quot;).  <br />I think Queen was just getting started in taking their music to new levels when Freddy died (he died ten months after this album's release).  Innuendo is a sad, but poignant trip into what might have been.

1559408855|4.0|I've wanted to see this film for the longest time as it is known as \\"the most disgusting movie ever made.\\" This of course intrigued me,but I also heard it was a very artistic film, incorporating many themes of human degradation and facism. Pier Pasolini directed this film and later was killed by a male prostitute (stabbed to death) and it was rumored he was killed FOR making this film. <BR>Now, I'm not going to go on and on about artistic values and philosophical thoughts, because I really don't know that much about the subject at hand, I merely was curious about the film and watched a friend's copy. Now, lots of parts are difficult to watch (especially if there are parents around); like extremely degrading sex acts, human torture, and sodomy. The film centers around a group of 4 middle aged men who decide to capture a large group of random young teens (about 14-17 years old) and bring them all back to a mansion to a former prostitute who would tell them stories about her life, very sexually explicit stories, with the help of other older women they would keep these children captured basically as sex slaves- most of the time they were naked, fondled and just toyed with for the pleasure of these men. One scene which almost had me gagging was one where they all sat for a dinner, the main course was a huge silver tray of steaming human feces, they all were forced to eat (the \\"bad\\" guys loving every morsel of it). Other scenes where some of the children actally enjoyed some homosexual acts with these men made me cringe (not because I have anything against gays, but this film was just so perverse, yet strongly intriguing about it). <BR>Well, there were a few girls in the group who wanted to rebel. Not much came of that except more punishment. The children really acted very cardboard cutout like, few of them making any real human emotion about what was going on. This in turn didn't earn your sympathies for them, giving you more leeway into watching the film, and didn't ever make you hate the men torturing these kids.<BR>The end of the film was the most violent, it was seen through a telescope by a man in a window watching naked teens being brutality torchered (one kid had his tounge pulled out, another had a lighter scorching his genatils, etc). The very end of the film does have a more positive outlook after all the mayhem you witness, almost optimistic of people as a whole-extremely well done. <BR>Anyway, in conclusion I would say that even though the subjects I mentioned about the film were so incredibly brutal and degrading, Pasolini doesn't seem to do it without a reason, this isn't some Troma film where it is made to shock. Pasolini is trying to make a statement about humanity, and even though I never figured out what it was exactly, it is evident throughout the film. Sure there were draggy parts within that could've been cut down, but as a whole this was probably one of the most revolting yet beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen. I won't soon forget it. If you've got a chance and have a very open mind, I highly recommend it, just don't watch it at face value. To truly appreciate this piece of art one must fully understand the history of facist ideas.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|So refreshing!  I'm pleasantly surprised to find a CD full of original sounds and songs.  For a minute there I was getting tired of listening to the same tunes over and over on the radio...after a while they kind of all blend together.  But not this!  The lead singer's voice perfectly fits the music.  I find myself driving and boppin' my head uncontrollably without realizing it, lol.  This CD also reminds me of music that was created 30 years ago; I can hear those influences.  I'm very pleased with this!
B00006IU73|4.0|Porcupine Tree's latest album is the smooth, enchanting fix metal heads like myself need without feeling guilty. I've heard a few songs by them before this album (they have lots, and aren't all easily accessible), and they definitely are one of the most original bands in music history. Why? Well, Steve Wilson is just a musical genius, and the whole band came out with a album of HIGH variety, amazing creativity, hypnotic grooves, and progressive 70's flare. He can write extremely catchy songs with great longevity and replay value, and more intriguing tunes that put you in a trance, thus, a few more listens are necessary to appreciate them, but you'll be glad you did. The album sounds like a less technical RadioHead with a 70's influence. <BR>I loved almost every song off this record, from their most catchiest to their most mellow to thier most technical and hypnotic. No instrument is ever overused; for example, the keyboard work isn't in every song, and only in those parts where it would be most effective, nothing is ever used to &quot;save&quot; a song from bordem like tons of other bands do. Also, no 2 songs sound alike. Every single one is distinctive and unique from the ones before and after it, yet still keeping the progressive rock roots in mind, which I should say is an INCREDIBLY difficult thing to achieve. You'll have to hear it to know what I mean. Although, from all the other PT stuff I've heard before, that's nothing new, all thier songs are very unique from one another. For example, with some songs I couldn't help but think of outer space, other parts made me feel like dancing like a hobbit, and others made me think of the seasons (if this makes any sense). <BR>Anyway, with all this said, the reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is only because there are 2 mediocre tracks on it. Track 10 just seems to go on forever and is one I tend to skip, track 11 is pretty good, mostly during the end but I won't listen to it all the time. Track 12 though ends thealbum BEAUTIFULLY. I don't know why, but the whole mood during that final masterpiece just makes you feel like you took a huge journey through the minds of these guys and are recalling every gorgeous second of it; a great ending. <BR>Still, about 90% of this album is remarkable, and I highly recommend it to any metalhead or just plain rock music fan, or folk music for that matter. There's not many albums out there that make you listen to the whole thing and just word to yourself &quot;niccce &quot; once it's over. This is one of them. Buy this NOW!!
B00000IP3S|5.0|This is my 3rd Blind Guardian CD.  I got NIME first then ANATO.  This one is by far my favorite.  The scary thing is that the other 2 kick so much ass, yet this one is better.  It is a very scary proposition.  This CD is full of harmonizing vocals, screaming while holding the note perfectly, you know....BG's usual style.  But the CD has NO bad songs.  all of them are simply amazing.  Get this CD and you will not be let down 5 STARS ALL THE WAY! BG RULES!

I introduced Beyonce as a great talanted musician to <BR>many of my friends who do not listen to English pop music, then....<BR>After this CD was out, It felt like a slap in the face to me!<br />Crazy in Love and Baby Boy are nice, but....I can't tell the <BR>differences between the rest songs.....they are just the same <BR>hard to swallow featuring Beyonce's blather-like vocal expressions
B000003TSP|4.0|melancholic, spooky, dreamy tunes into which the mind gently melts.<br />Less accessible than some would expect but more enduring if you give it a chance.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is a junk movie... no redeeming value, no plot, no anything! Total hype!<BR>Like the emporer's clothes, there is absolutely nothing there!!!<BR>An ego trip for a no talent wanna be... someone needs their olfactories checked... this stinks to no end...<BR>How low can one's level of minimal standards go? This is an insult to all movie buffs... watching grass grow is way more exciting and interesting than this tasteless waste of time and money; an insult to the movie world...<BR>Nothing there to get lost...
B00014K5TQ|4.0|a deliciously debaucherous but tragic tale of lust, power, fame and \\"search for something more\\" that many of us can relate to. This movie is a largely expertly acted and amusingly shot film that reminds one of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - with lots of color and realistic hallucinogenic forays.<br />Hilarious, thought-provoking and very sad...all in one fell swoop, capturing the essence of a subculture that ended up changing an entire culture. A thoroughly amusing film in many ways.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|For those of us fans who were utterly awed by 'Fumbling Toward Ecstasy' (1993), somewhat disappointed with 'Surfacing' (1997), and have been waiting for 6 years for new material, the return to her long locks had us hoping.<br />Specifically, I was hoping that Sarah would veer away from the unplugged/piano/torch/singer approach overutilized on her last studio record and now mastered by Norah Jones, and begin re-utilizing the talents of Pierre Marchand, who has helmed the production on all her records.  I was not disappointed by the first single, &quot;Fallen&quot;, or the superb tracks, &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;.  But even though this record is more . . . well, electric . . . the incessant mellowness is endemic.  On some spots it works, such as the groove on &quot;Train Wreck&quot; or the closer &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;, but the rest of the songs suffer from the same lyrical sapiness that characterized 'Surfacing'.<br />In any case, I do have one major complaint.  That is, when you sift through the live and remix records and appearances on soundtracks (usually with cover tunes), over the last DECADE, we have been treated to 19 new songs, clocking in at less than 80 minutes.  Here's a suggestion - why doesn't she just release one single a year.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|a fascinating and sometimes annoying journey into the lives of two characters who, I believe, probably never would have met in real life. The idea of a twenty-three or twenty-four year old beauty making overtures to an aging American (even with Murray's comedy and charm) made me scratch my head before the movie even really got started. For a movie to sweep the awards causes my expectations to go pretty high, which frequently proves somewhat a let-down when I actually experience the film.<br />I gradually warmed up to these interesting characters and their bizarre (and privileged) relationship but almost snoozed when Murray was filming the commercials and wandering around as if he didn't have a clue. The seemingly unsatisfying relationship between the young couple seemed forced and cliched, the young man appearing to be so remiss and so uncaring and such a parody of the young &quot;hip&quot; working artist. Again, in real life a joker like this would have been thanking his lucky stars for being with such a hottie and doing what he could to make sure she was enjoying herself and cared for in Tokyo.<br />The film is really carried by the depth of the two main characters and the gradually appealing and whimsical nature of their pseudo-relationship.<br />I cannot help but think that Coppola has taken the &quot;nepotism pays&quot; motif to such an all-time high that it's truly impossible to objectively review this work. The hype is way too high for what we actually get.<br />I obviously enjoyed getting to know these characters but found the film ultimately lacking in substance. I just don't think that everything which is atmospheric and melancholic justifies the description of genius.<br />Geeez, I hate to be such a naysayer on this one, I just found the boredom level to be a tad high relative to the expectations. Would have been nice to discover this one (and all its charm) separate from the hype.
B00008J4P5|2.0|After hearing Fell in Love With a Girl and Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground I really felt like this album would be good, not to mention all the hype it was getting.  After listening to it I felt like most of the songs, and especially the lyircs on songs like Little Acorns, were forced.  The cover of the Burt Bacharach song, I Just Don't Know What To Do Myself, sounds akward and is not easy to listen to.  I really did like Ball and Biscuit, especially the guitar solos, though and if it weren't for that song I think this would only get 1 star.
B000092Q4U|5.0|It is no wonder why the major labels have taken note of this band which i believe is a future metal giant.  In a day and age when bands like Korn and Papa Roach are considered &quot;METAL&quot;, it is extremely hard to find a REAL metal band that holds interest.  Lamb of God is possibly the savior of real heavy metal.  As the Palaces Burn is an absolutely phenomenal album. For this reason, as well as fanfare, is why Epic Records opened their eyes and realized that Lamb of God is definitely not a band to discredit.  If you only buy one cd this year....make it As the Palaces Burn by Lamb of God...you won't be disappointed
0140177396|3.0|I thought that Of Mice and Men was a good book.  I enjoyed all of the action that took place.  Especially when they arrived at the ranch to work.  Between all of the fights, the girls, the puppies and the work it was very interesting.  I thought that it kept you wanting to read it.  I also think that Linnie made the book because you never knew what he was going to do or what was going to happen next.  I enjoyed the book and I hope you will too.
0140288503|4.0|Tough time to read this tough book about super tough soldiers.  A non-fiction account of what happens in war when a mission goes astray.  In the case of Black Hawk Down, helicopters get shot down in war torn Mogadishu.  Bowden's reporter background helps tell an amazing tale of survival though a bit light on the local perspective.  The thought distracting me from this well written story was the reality that these survivors are walking around with the memory of their fallen comrades.  And similar missions take place every day in Iraq.  Tough times in our country.  <BR>Michael Duranko<BR>[...]
B00005JMJ4|4.0|One aspect I particularly appreciated was the observation of Japanese life and culture from a foreigner's perspective.  Outwardly, Tokyo is a typical bustling metropolis.  But with closer observation, strange and bizarre things come to light.  From crazy TV talk shows, to Buddhist temples, to inexplicable politeness and reserve, the viewer is shown tidbits of Japanese society without either negative or positive commentary.  Coppola allows the viewer to process the information just as the protagonists do.  And these &quot;alien&quot; observations only add to the feeling of being lost in a foreign land.<br />Scarlett Johansson was wonderful.  She displayed such an enchanting &quot;naturalness&quot; thoughout the film.  Her performance, in my opinion, was more impressive than Murray's.
B0001AP12G|5.0|It's been a long time since I've listened to an album from track 1 to 21 and liked every song on it.  Kanye is reppin the Chi like he should cause this album is the hottest out right  now. From songs like &quot;All falls down&quot; to songs like &quot;The workout plan&quot; Kanye keeps it right....He is definitely THE TRUTH
B000000WA4|5.0|this is the best pumpkins album to date. very diverse in sound from the soft and soothing mellon collie and the infinite sadness, galapagos, take me down, thirty-three, in the arms of sleep, stumbeleine, beautiful, lily, by starlight, and farewell and goodnight to the hard, blasting guitar and drum classics like jellybelly, zero, bullet with butterfly wings, and basically everything else. some beautiful songs and songwriting in tonight, tonight, cupid de locke, 1979, etc. i prefer dawn to dusk over twighlight to startlight, though, as the songs consisting the first disk reflected more the sound that won them fame in gish and siamese dream, my second favorite album. the second disk had more (it seemed to me) harder rock songs like where the boys fear to tread, bodies, tales of a scorched earth, through the eyes of ruby, and especially x.y.u. these are all great songs, but leaning precariously toward the machina/machina II sound of distorted guitar in loud, blaring songs. i have no objections with this, but prefer the cleaner pumpkins sound of the first few albums to distortedness and/or synthesization. this album symbolizes in its entirety the sound that the pumpkins had been trying so hard for so long to reach. this album still stands as a monumental acheivement for the pumpkins (going octuple platinum and all) and i highly reccommend it to anyone dubious about buying it. a work of art, truly.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a thrilling book which grabs your seat and makes you want to read all the way till the last page of the book. A classic John Steinbeck novel, it never ceases to excite readers with its unpredictable story. Two main characters, George and Lenny, starts off the journey with a dream but without the resources, they are left with nothing but their dreams. Of all friendships that started, George and Lenny's were the most unpredictable one. George, a small built guy with brains, and Lenny, a big built muscular guy but is no where as smart as George, were complete opposites. Throughout the book, George has no choice but to control Lenny is everyway and Lenny, being the strong man that he is, is not able to control himself without George, Lenny is lost in his world of his own which makes total chaos. To me, it is without a doubt that the best part of Steinbeck's writing is his ability to get into people's heart and able to play with their emotions. Throughout the novel, there are many wicked twists and that's what makes this novel enjoyable. As I started reading the book from the first page, the feeling of happiness was what I felt, but as it heads for the end, I felt the feeling of remorse and sadness. The novel itself, has a complex meaning behind it, a meaning which cannot be expressed by words, but can only be expressed by reading it. This is perhaps one of the classic novels. The novel was and I think still is banned from a couple of places in the world, and sometimes, it gets you thinking, why would they want to ban a book? Is it something the government of don't want to reveal to the public? Whatever it is, this is a classic novel that will always be part of America's history in literature.
B000001ABD|4.0|A single disc version of SONG REVIEW is available which I bought in 1998.  As you can expect, the track listing is extremely tight to fit the most essential tracks in.  But they have missed some very important tracks (eg. Boogie on Reggae Woman, Higher Ground).  Not long after I noticed that a friend had also bought this CD.  Her copy was also a single disc edition but a different track listing to mine.  For pete's sake I thought.  The record company really stuffed up with this release. While I am happy with my tracklisting, her tracklisting is much more definitive.  I have looked at the American double CD release and it is missing tracks than are on my single CD.<br />The solution is to buy Stevie's wonderful studio albums.  I bought Song Review simply to have a compilation but it in no way does the man justice. if you have ever wanted a Stevie album look no further than \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" or \\"Innervisions\\".<br />When will record companies release compilations correctly?
0062502182|5.0|Despite being a surprisingly simple book filled with simplistic wording, short phrasing and curt statements, The Alchemist, by Paul Coelho, is a book that one remembers for a long time after they have read it. The short novel centers around a shepherd boy named Santiago, who yearns to explore and discover treasures in the far parts of the world. As he begins in Spain, dreams and signs that appear to lead in one constant path guide him. On his journey, he continues learning about strange, new concepts of spirituality, emotions, folklore, concepts of Romanticism that Coelho managed to combine within this story.<BR> Even though the storyline is rather easy to follow throughout the book, the abstract ideas and thoughts that surround the character are often highly thought invoking. Concepts of life, love, and destiny abound in this story, often requiring a lot of thinking in between the chapters. The element of magic adds to the intrigue, since it is often in the discussions Santiago has with other characters about magic that reveal more insight to the plot. Taken simply, the story appears as an analogy to life and its processes. However, under closer analysis, The Alchemist turns out to closely entwine the different cultures of the Mediterranean, as well as offer a glimpse into religious beliefs and values of the region, namely Islam and Christianity.<BR> Another factor in the quality of this story relies on the small twists and turns that are scattered randomly throughout the plot, making the story fairly hard to predict. The introduction of characters is at an easy pace, with the author only mentioning those vital to the plot, while other roles are downplayed. In effect, this style highlights the true values of each individual in the book, as well as gives the reader a positive outlook on the authors values. By combining the factors of emotion and religion, life and continuity, good and evil, Coelho manages to stir the reader impressionably every time the book is read and re-read.
0060730552|4.0|This is the true story of one man's survival against incredible odds. It is a short book (less than 200 pages) but not what I would call an \\"easy read\\". I found the first 3/4 of the book interesting but slow moving (too many technical terms; I had a hard time visualizing where they were on the mountain). The last quarter of the book the pace quickens and it becomes a very compelling read. I found that it ended a bit abruptly and could have used a longer epilogue. It is more the story than the writing that makes this a 4 star rating.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is almost perfect. It has two minor problems. First, Third Eye is just too long. As a big Rush fan, I'm familiar with extended hard rock songs, and Tool just didn't pull this one off. Halfway through, I get lost and a little bored. The band plays well, but the song seems pointlessly extended.<br />Second, the interludes are not nearly as good as the songs. Tracks like Useful Idiot and Cesaro Summability are too easy. They fit in the context of the rest of the album, but along with Die Eier von Satan and creepy stuff like Message to Harry Manback, they are just stop-gaps between the music. (Although I'd have to say that negative Ions, which is nothing more than 4 minutes of static, is my favorite of the interlude tracks. Go figure.)<br />The rest of the album is amazing. This is a band that allows the drummer and bass player to stand out, unlike too many other heavy metal bands. The drums on Hooker with a Penis and Pushit are really impressive. Eulogy is full of tension, Aenima is a perfect radio hit (except for the liberal use of cursing:), and Forty Six and 2 is as tight as a fist. The secret weapons on this CD are Pushit and H, two songs that require repeated listening to reveal themselves. If you like smart heavy metal, you'll love this album. This is the kind of CD you listen to obsessively when you get it --- and you still reach for it ten years later.
B00000DG1R|3.0|I would rate this collection as very good, except for some serious reservations regarding the CD quality.  In terms of the tunes, the inclusion of shortened radio edits of songs like &quot;Rio&quot; is ultimatley balanced out by inclusion of versions of &quot;The Reflex&quot; and &quot;Ordinary World&quot; that are actually superior to the original album versions.  So, no big problems then with the song selection.  <br />What is TOTALLY pathetic about this CD is its manufacturing - it only plays correctly thru to the end on certain CD players.  I'm on my second copy of it already and it has the exact same problem as the first one did... &quot;Come Undone&quot; (the last song) skips so badly on most CD players that it's barely listenable.  They cut it way too close in terms of time/data limits on this disc; there is apparently more music on here than a (mass produced) CD is meant to hold - consequently the CD skips.  Great music.  Crap manufacturing.
B0000CABBW|4.0|\\"Whale Rider\\" is not your everday girl power movie.<br />The heroine, Paikea(Keisha Castle-Hughes), is the granddaughter of a New Zealand chief and the descendant of the famous Paikea, who supposedly rode a whale through the South Seas to New Zealand. Her grandfather has been awaiting the next male chief: alas, his oldest son (whom it has to be) becomes an artist and his oldest son dies at birth. But he leaves a twin sister...and that is the lovely Paikea who wants nothing more than to be the next chief. <br />Ah but her grandfather has different ideas. THough he cares for her, he grows to believe that since her birth (she's about 13 in the movie), everything bad has happened. He tries to establish a school for boys to teach them \\"old ways\\"; Paikea learns these ways on the sly. The more she tries, the angrier her grandfather becomes. <br />Though this movie deals with such noble themes as leadership and the mystical relationship humans can have with animals, its settings are quite mundane. The families live in modest though modern houses. The school is adequate though threadbare. Children are born in hospitals. The grandfather is a chief by night but seems to clean sewers or set up septic systems by day. <br />The movie also moves slowly. I still enjoyed it but I can see how the pacing could bother some viewers.<br />Yet I would recommend this movie to nearly everyone who enjoys art house fare or coming of age pictures. You'll also witness an astonishing performance from Castle-Hughes.<BR>(DVD note-the feature on its making is great)
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway To Hell by AC/DC has got to be one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time! Its load, its raw, and its heavy! Its the perfect album, well almost.<br />Highway To Hell was AC/DC's last album with front man Bon Scott, because he died like right after it was released. Besides Back In Black this is AC/DC's best album. Its there most raw and powerful. Its bluesy as well. The first four songs are the best on the record with the amazing title track, 'Girls Got Rhythm' 'Walk All Over You' and 'Touch Too Much.'  All of which are classic AC/DC songs. The opening title track sets the pace for the rest of the amazing album. 'Beating Around The Bush' is goodd but nothing to brag about. 'Shot Down In Flames' is classic. 'Get It Hot' and 'Love Hungry Man' are both decent songs. 'If You Want Blood (You Got It)' is a classic, killer AC/DC song. 'Night Prowler' is one of AC/DC's best songs. Its a bluesy track and its heavy. This is AC/DC's most contraversal song because some guy stalked some chick and wore an AC/DC hat around the time this was released.<br />This is Classic, its among AC/DC's best albums. As far as Bon Scott goes this was his best album so dont miss out!
B00018D44U|5.0|Feels like Home is a very good album.  Norah Jones sounds great on all these tracks.  I liked every song on this CD.  Sunrise is a very pretty song about how quickly time flies by.  It is a romantic song with simple lyrics.  Toes is a great song about how the simple act of toes touching water can make a person feel safe and at ease.  These two songs are examples of how Norah sings about the beauty of ordinary things so well.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the sassy blues song What Am I to You?  It is a good song about being devoted to the person you love, but also about wondering if that person loves you in return.  I loved the song Carnival Town.  It is very relaxed and soothing.  Norah sounds great on the piano on this track too.  Humble Me is another favorite song on this album.  It is about being alone and down on your luck and asking forgiveness for your miskakes.<br />Creepin in is a lively country duet with Dolly Parton.  Their voices blend very well together.  I think it's great that Norah continues to explore with different styles of music.  The Long Way Home is an excellent song about struggling to keep things together and trying to find a place called home.  I wish the words to this song were included here.  I loved the smooth silky romantic quality of the song Don't Miss You at All.  Norah Jones combines elements of jazz, blues, country, and pop music on this album to create her own unique sound.  It is an excellent follow up to her debut Come Away With Me.  I loved listening to Feels like Home.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This is by far the best studio album The Greatful Dead ever recorded. Workingman was good but this is just that much better. Jerry Garcia's amazing guitar playing comes through full blast here on this classic album. The lyrics are the best they had been up untill this point.<br />The album starts off with the bands all time best song 'Box Of Rain' its a slower ballad with some beautiful lyrics. The album also closes with The Greatful Dead's second best song 'Truckin' this song is The Deads most rock and roll song, and it has Jerry Garcia's greatest guitar solo of all time! Other classics include 'Friend Of The Devil' 'Sugar Magnolia' 'Ripple' and the awsome 'Ripple' The band was never tighter then on this album.<br />Like I said you cant get better then American Beauty for The Greatful Dead, Working Man's Dead is good but this is bettter. Dont be fooled by the people who tell you that the live albums are better, beacuse they can get boring some of the songs are like 45 minutes long on Europe '72. If you want a good live album stick with Live Dead, its their only decent live album.Col
0679805273|5.0|I came across this book when I was in my late 20's.  I think it puts things in perspective for adults when we become stressed and overwhelmed.  I don't think I would have appreciated the book if I would have read it in my youth years.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I finally listened to the entire album through headphones and could not pull myself away until the last song was over.  I have NEVER heard acoustic sound this good with such amazing lyrics.  This album is so deep with so much emotion in each song, it's hard not to get affected by it.
B000002KIE|5.0|The raw energy of these songs, the nihilistic lyrics, and Johnny Rottens vocals which drip cycnicism and sarcasm, make this a seminal punk rock album.  If you want some more musicianship in your punk, you'd be better off sampling Television, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, The Heartbreakers, the Clash, and others.  But for sheer attitude and sneering disdain for authority, this debut album sets the standard.  The tunes are catchy, simple, and short but sweet.  Give it a try.
B000094HMU|5.0|This is an intersting production, showing the sparkling &quot;historical&quot; setting by Zeffirelli (everything looks like you imagine China would have been, if it is true or not) with an even more interesting cast. Marton truely gives an impressive performance of Turandot without any difficulties. Timur and Liu also leave not much to be desired. And Domingo, well he certainly had a briliant day. Especially so since the tessitura of Calaf is actually a little bit too high for him but I was impressed of how secure he managed through the difficult part. Therefore it casts only a little shadow to see him circumvent (or better circumsing) the high note at the end of the 2d act (&quot;No, no, Principessa altera, Ti voglio tutta ardente d'amor&quot;). Probably this is still better than hearing his voice as strained as in the Karajan recording. Especially since all the other &quot;high notes&quot; are brilliant and firm. Conclusion: You cannot go wrong with this one.
B00006879E|5.0|I admit that I got this CD after hearing Harder to Breathe and This Love played all the time on the radio, but they are not my favorite tracks on this CD. No song is bad, or annoying, but some stand out (my favorites are 'She Will Be Loved,' 'Must Get Out' and best of all, 'Through With You,' with 'Shiver,' 'Harder to Breathe' and 'This Love' following.) The songs all have great beats, fantastic music (with catchy choruses that'll definitely get stuck in your head) and clear lyrics. This is one of the best CDs I've listened to in a while - I cannot recommend it enough. You've got to hear She Will Be Loved, Must Get Out, and Through With You.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|WIthout a doubt the most lovely Disney movie ever.  Actually one of the best movies ever.  This newly restored eddition is so wonderful.  It has tons of extras that everybody loves, that are also extremely facinating.  They have the original music video with Celine Dion singing Beauty and the Beast which is one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  The newly restored version of the movie is breathtaking.  I remember being mezmerized with it when I was growing up.  I thought it was the best movie ever and today I still think it is the best (Well only Sound of Music tops it).  This movie is one of the best love stories ever written and there is a reason it was the first animated movie to be nominated for an oscar.  If you don't have this you are missing out on the most amazing movies ever!
B0001AP12G|5.0|He's one of those people you never get tired of and with College Dropout he really shows it. This album is truely colorful, you can feel it in your soul and dance at the same time. If i could give this album 10 stars i would. Hip Hop is back and Kanye is the King with the old one stepping down. I'm loving \\"Last Call\\" and \\"We Dont Care\\", he should make a video for every song cuz there all tight. Big Ups Kanye, u a genius nicca!
B0001I561E|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD from the first day I bought a DVD player! This is by far the best Disney movie ever. It has the perfect blend of fun, adventure, romance and comedy! The songs are beautiful and the characters imaginative. Though Lion King and Beauty and the Beast both come in a close second, I don't think Disney has ever before or will ever again make a movie that is this good. Even the recent Finding Nemo didn't hold a candle to it in my eyes. You'll laugh, you'll cry and then you'll probably laugh again! Iago and the Genie are two of the greatest characters ever in any Disney movie. I love it because the characters aren't so one dimensional. Jasmine is more then just a pretty princess waiting for a man to come rescue her. She's strong willed and fiery. And Aladdin, well...he's more charismatic and well rounded then any Prince Charming ever was. This is a must for all fairy tale fans. It's a must for all Disney fans. This is a must for all who love happily ever after stories.
B0000DJZAH|2.0|Believe your ears people. This is NOT revolutionary, in fact its quite boring. With the exception of about five songs, this entire recording is worthless. The Who dropped their trashy, punk sound and cleaned up their image, and, hence, increased their popularity. I, personally, hate Tommy and everything after. For a tollorabe concept album, I'd stick with the Kink's &quot;Village Green...&quot; or &quot;Arthur.&quot;
B0001906O0|5.0|Here we are in 2004 and The Cure are still in demand and most importantly, relevant.  \\"Join The Dots\\" solidifies The Cure's place in music history as if it weren't secured already.  The critics were almost never kind to them for the span of their entire career.  They critisized them during the Pornography-era for trying to sound like Joy Division and then when they went into the Head On The Door, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me-era they accused them of being too poppy, too happy.  They rarely ever took Robert Smith seriously due to his appearance and not his music.  If The Cure's career were solely based on critical praise they would have disbanded back in 1979.  <br />Obviously, they touched a nerve and did something right, they appealed to more people than the critics will ever give them credit for. With bands like The Rapture, Hot Hot Heat and Deftones citing The Cure as an influence their importance cannot be denied.  While there are some songs that I'm not crazy about, it's still amazing for a band to somehow still produce excellent b-sides and compilation tracks for a span of over 20 years!  The packaging is very attractive, the booklet inside has some great quotes and pictures of the band through the years with different members and hairstyles. <br />Songs like; This Twilight Garden, Just One Kiss, Harold & Joe, and More Than This alone are worth the purchase but it holds many more gems than those. Unfortunately it's taken all this time for the critics to truly appreciate their genius that was always there but now they seem willing to admit it now.  Their influence around the world proves this. Now I know this is probably not on the same level as say \\"Sci-Fi Lullabies\\" from Suede or \\"Louder Than Bombs, Hatful Of Hollow\\" from The Smiths but it's damn close. As always the critics on NME gave this a 6/10 and Q Magazine gave it just 2 stars but in all honesty I think we know better than them.
B00005JM1F|5.0|This movie will be writen down in the pantheon of comedy classics such as Animal House, Caddy shack, Stripes, and Rushmore.  The film is a well done comedy - not an easy feat, as anyone knows that has sat through a bad one.  The writing is great, and my buddies and I know the lines by memory and send lines via email during the day.  <BR>For example: &quot;This house is practically on campus, its sick.  How did you score this?&quot;<br />&quot;It was pretty easy really...a professor lived for 30 years and just died.&quot;<BR>&quot;That is awesome....pause....awesome (while giving a high-five)&quot;  ******  Priceless
0385504209|5.0|This is an extremely well written book with alot of interesting information.  I found it very difficult to put it down!
0440237688|5.0|From Oscar Wilde's Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray: \\"Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.\\"   <br />A good pick for readers at both the middle-school level and the high school level, Lowry's prize-winning novel takes her audience beneath the surface of Jonas'  world.  When he begins to see beyond and beneath the perfect exterior of the Community, Jonas as well as the reader must make a difficult choice.<br />This is a very good book to spark discussions about our society today, our future, and our choices.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially in a classroom setting.  Lowry's gifts of characterization, symbolism, and emotion make this a truly great find.
B000025SJ8|5.0|I don't care that Varg killed that sewer rat Euronymous... I think he did the world a favor.<br />Anyway, he's a great musician, despite what some may say.  Sure, his music isn't technical, but he's an expressionist, not a scientist.  His screams are very passionate, and although many may be turned off by them, I actually think they sound pretty good (keep in mind, this is coming from the guy who lists Dani Filth as one of his favorite vocalists).  Burzum's lyrics are thought-provoking and full of emotion, and are delivered in a way that makes you feel the Count's torment.  His instrumentals aren't brilliant, but are great to create atmosphere in the listener.  If there is one issue I have with this disc, it's the volume, which is too low, but if that's the only problem, then I'd say that Count Grishnack did a great job.  One other thing; I don't care if he's a racist.  I'm not one myself, but if black rappers can use terms like &quot;cracker&quot; and &quot;devil&quot; in their music and be praised for it by Al Sharpton and his buddies, then Varg Vikernes should be allowed to have bigot thoughts and not be scolded for it.  Hypocrites.  Anyway, Burzum rocks, and I think everyone should get this album now.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This box set is a must for all fans of Creedence.  The historical significance of the Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets and the Golliwogs tracks alone is important but the real deal is having all of CCR's recorded history together in one collection.  Creedence Clearwater Revival was one of the ten best bands to ever record and this set has it all.  My one complaint is that I wish that there would have been one disc for each album rather than the overlapping that is here but that's just a small  problem.  All you have to do is load all six CDs into your system and sit back and enjoy some of the greatest rock n roll ever recorded.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I have nothing but disdain for the greedy way in which HBO has held off from releasing Six Feet Under season 2.  (I rated the DVD 5 stars simply because of the content of the season in general).  If you look at the timely fashion in which Sex in the City, The Sopranos and OZ has been released on video/DVD then it becomes all the more apparent that HBO is milking this series way beyond what it has got.   Considering what we all pay to get HBO (all garbage with the exception of 3 of their original series - they still play 80's movies like \\"Guess Who's Talking\\" a couple times a week) plus the costs of either renting or owning the seasons a couple years after HBO has toyed with the public I can't fathom that they haven't satisfied their immense appetite for greed.   I wish I could boycott this show somehow but Hollywood has worked its greedy magic once again and we are left to pay.  It is unfortunate considering we already paid to see the show years ago.  Looks like I will unfortunately being paying to see it yet again.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I only give this DVD 3 stars because the DVD presentation is fairly bad. The Focus Features advertisement at the beginning has to be fast forwarded through. I couldn't switch audio presentations during the film; Dolby had a light crackle in the right rear speaker (maybe just my system, but DTS didn't have it). When I did switch to DTS I couldn't resume the movie where I left off, I had to use the scene selection to get back to where I was. The list goes on. Extras are nice but the only thing I would have liked would be a commentary track by the stars and/or the director. I thought this movie was out kind of soon on DVD, and now I see that they may have rushed things. I have rarely been this disappointed in the DVD presentation of a movie I've liked so much. Collectors may want to wait for a better presentation.<br />The movie is excellent. Issues aside, once you hit play it's about the film.
B000002AGE|5.0|This is my favorite WX Report release...  many reasons.  Jaco is one, Shorter is too cool...  etc...  and despite what some people claim Acuna fills the percussion seat very well.  I really dig the interplay and use of the technology of the 70's.  Zawinal really ecked out some superior waveforms on equipment which was technically \\"soft.\\"  I dig quite a bit of fusion music... but WX Report was unique... in way that perhaps Miles Davis was.  I think Pastorius may have been the definative reason as far as the vibe went...  but the entire group was contributing greatly to the music.  I think of all the WX Report releases I have. This one has the chemistry.  It is a timeless classic.  Listen to a \\"return to forever\\" release from the same era, then put on this Heavy Weather...  what a difference!  Each unit had it's positives, but for me Heavy Weather was about texture and layers and magnificent muscianship and interplay.  Weather Report's Heavy Weather is a cultural and genre' jewel of great value.  Expressive and impressive.
B00001R3HX|4.0|4.5 stars.  I recently purchased &quot;In Absentia&quot; and was immediately hooked; subsequent reeling and I purchased both &quot;Signify&quot; and this album.  Overall, I think &quot;In Absentia&quot; is the best I've heard from them so far.  But &quot;Signify&quot; is nearly excellent, and this CD is nearly so as well, but for different reasons.  While &quot;Signify&quot; has a definite early-Genesis prog-rock feel to it, this album is certainly and obviously influenced more so by Pink Floyd.  It is incredibly spacey with heady ambience and colorful, masterful production. I'm beginning to believe that Steve Wilson is a genius in the studio.  What at first listen should seem simplistic and unremarkable is arranged into something surreal and whole, noteworthy and vital.  This CD is easy to recommend.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I saw this movie a few days after it was released and I was blown away by it.  The music really captured me and only added to the emotion the movie gave off.  Every song on the soundtrack can stand alone.  Each one is dark, beautiful, mysterious, and compelling at the same time.  The last three songs alone are enough to captivate the listener.  The first piece of greatness comes on track three...Minas Tirith.  This is where the theme is first introduced and it is done so in a grand fashion.  The last minute and a half of the song is one entire theme that sums up the movie.  This song is similar to A Shadow of the Past on the first soundtrack and The Riders of Rohan on the second.  Another standout is the fifth track The Steward of Gondor.  I dont have to tell you how incredible Billy Boyd's voice is just read the other reviews.  One of the more emotional songs that I'm surprised more people dont talk about here is track fifteen, The Black Gate Opens.  The song leads up to an incredible part of the score ( and movie ) where Sam literally carries Frodo up the slopes of Mt. Doom.  And then of course there are the last three songs.  Track seventeen, The Return of the King is a ten minute adventure that rolls up about five different scenes from the movie into one.  Track eighteen, The Grey Havens is my favorite.  It is also the most emotional and it is fitting because it is the most emotional scene in the movie as well.  Every time i listen to it I get the chills.  I keep seeing Frodo leaving and departing from Middle Earth.  Sam and Merry and Pippin all crying behind him.  It is an extremely touching piece.  And the last song is the best of the three vocal songs from the movies.  Annie Lennox gives a great vocal performance and the lyircs are reely incredible as well.  This album is a beautiful work of art and one that most people sould enjoy very much.
B00005J6UP|5.0|If you are a child of the 80's, and grew up a little chunky, you should feel deprived from your friends if you never had to do the truffle-shuffle! Growing up in the 80's all I wanted was to go find a Pirate's treasure, because I was a goonie too!!!
0790729369|5.0|This was definetly a watch alone type movie.  I felt as if I was inside the picture.  This was wonderful from begining to end.  This will always remain one of the #1 best movies that I have ever watched.  I have ordered the music from this movie and cry everytime I listen to it.  I love it!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie is a semi-autobiography of how Cameron Crowe (director of Almost Famous) got started as a rock journalist.<br />It all begins in the Christmas of 1969 in San Diego (complete with the Chimpmunks singing \\"Christmas Don't Be Late\\" in the background), where 11 year old William Miller finds out an embarassing secret and his rebellious older sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) leaves home to see the country.  She leaves him her record collection with a note \\"Light a candle while listening to Tommy and you will see your future.\\"  Cut to 1973, William (Patrick Fugit) turns 15 and aspires to interview some rock bands, with his semi-understandably protective mother (Frances McDonald) as the reluctant chauffer.  Here he befriends the charismatic \\"band aid\\" Penny Lane, whom he naturally grows to have a crush on (Kate Hudson) and the rock band Stillwater against rock critic Lester Bangs'(played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) advice.  William and Penny wind up on tour with the band, with William trying hard to get interviews with each member with little success.  Lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) is in love with fame (\\"Make me look cool, man!\\") and Russell the guitarist just wants everything to be \\"real, man!\\"  Based loosely on the adventures of the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin (\\"I'm a golden god!\\"), William sees the rise and near falls of Stillwater firsthand. Meanwhile, Mrs. Miller wants her son William home.  \\"Rock stars have kidnapped my son!\\" she exclaims, while attempting to teach college students.<br />Then, of course, there's the music- The Who's \\"Sparks\\", Simon and Garfunkel's \\"America\\", The Guess Who's \\"Albert Flasher\\", Neil Young's \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\\" Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\", Stevie Wonder's \\"Cherie Amour\\", Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", Yes' \\"Your Move\\", Deep Purple's \\"Burn\\" (which came out in 1974), Zeppelin's \\"Rain Song\\", \\"That's the Way\\" and \\"Tangerine\\" and closing with the Beach Boys' surrealistic \\"Feel Flows.\\"<br />If you really liked the movie, I cannot recommend The Bootleg Cut enough.  In addition to the movie (both the director's cut and the cinema version), there are outtakes (one features William trying to defend that music is art with \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in which you provide the musical soundtrack yourself!), the Stillwater concert in its entirety, Cameron Crowe's comments on some of his favorite albums of the 1970's, some of Crowe's interviews with Zep, Fleetwood Mac, Allman Bros and a CD of Stillwater's songs (written by Peter Frampton, Nancy Wilson and Cameron Crowe).  Last but not least is an introspective commentary given by Mr. Crowe (with support of his mother!).  If you liked classic rock and have yet to see Almost Famous, to paraphrase a line from a Stillwater song \\"you have to be there!\\"
0743216458|5.0|Stephen Ambrose successfully captured the moments of 101st Airborne. This book was dedicated to the soldiers who gave their lives during World War II. It followed the footsteps of E company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne or well known as the &iexcl;§Screaming Eagles&iexcl;¨.<br />As a top elite parachute regiments, men in &iexcl;§Easy&iexcl;¨ company had their toughest experience in their lives. They first met as a group in Camp Toccoa, Georgia. They all came from different places and background but with one goal &iexcl;§to serve their country well&iexcl;¨. They later were sent to Europe to fight the &iexcl;§Jerries&iexcl;¨ or the Germans. They parachuted through the sky of Normandy. They fought against time in Holland. They were in the freezing foxholes of Bastogne. They fought bravely as a group. They had heavy casualties. Brothers and friends were lost. They somehow survived through the harsh time of the war. It was because of these moments that the men of E company began to trust their brother soldiers and later became &iexcl;§Band of Brothers&iexcl;¨.<br />The book told individual stories of E company. For example Major Richard Winter, who was basically the most incredible person of the whole company. He led the group with intelligence and &iexcl;§common sense&iexcl;¨. He led the group through all the battles they went through and never forgetting his soldiers when raised for a higher rank. He gained more than just respect from the men of Easy. They had love like brotherhood which made them unique from other companies.<br />Stephen Ambrose recorded every action, operation or even patrols of Easy Company. The book is very detailed in every action taken, with colorful and exciting lines. Dialogues and social talk between men made me as the reader more into the actual battle. Different perspectives were written down to show the characteristic of each person.<br />There are pictures and maps in the book to make sure the reader follow along. The book is very &iexcl;§real&iexcl;¨ side of the war. It showed the true feeling of soldiers trying to survive through harsh conditions. This book moved many readers including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who later made this book into an HBO TV series, &iexcl;¥Band of Brothers&iexcl;¨.<br />I would recommend this book to people who are interesting in history of the 101st airborne and World War II. This book is simply a forgettable classic.ng of soldiers trying to survive through harsh conditions. This book moved many readers including Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks who later made this book into an HBO TV series, ¡¥Band of Brothers¡¨.<br />I would recommend this book to people who are interesting in history of the 101st airborne and World War II. This book is simply a forgettable classic.
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I Don't Think I Would Title This Movie \\"The Best Scary-Movie Ever\\"  However, It Was A Fabulous Movie & I Will Be Buying It On March 23rd When It Get's Released.  Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, and Robert Downey Jr. Were EXCELLENT In The Movie.  When You Expected Something To Happen, It Didn't - Kept You On Your Toes The Whole Time!  A DEFINATE MUST BUY!
B0001A79JO|4.0|This is a fantastic record that really kicks!  If you like psychobilly, ska, punk, rock, goth, or any combo of those, you will find something enjoyable on this CD.  There were a couple of weak songs in the middle that I didn't really get into (Cool Flattop), but overall it's a lot of fun.  Not only do you get some great vocals and stand up bass playin' by Patricia, but we are treated to some guitar work from the mighty Necroman from Necromantix!  <BR>Give it a try.  The CD looks cool, and sounds even cooler!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I just read in the Febuary 20th issue of Entertainment Weekly that Lucas and Fox have set the release date for the trilogy on DVD to be September 21st, 2004.  They said it will a four disc set, probably like Indiana Jones.  Just thought you may like to know.  I do not know if this is for sure but Entertainment Weekly is usually reliable.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Focus films may be known for distributing films that are outside the formulaic holiwood system, but they're not so great on packing the disc with extras that most people want from a movie that's on the academy awards top honor list (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay (original), and Film).  <br />Since my fellow reviewer above has talked at great length about the beauty and grace (as well as plot) of this film, I'm going to focus on the DVD EXTRAS and the PURCHASE VALUE of this dvd.  <br />The Movie:  The 1:85:1 Anamorphic widescreen looks just as it should. The audio is a little on the quiet side at times, but should be loud enough through the center channel.  Considering what 5.1 stands for in the film industry these days...you're not going to get much out of your surround sound speakers...so a 2.0 track would have been nice.  The performances by Mr. Murray and Ms. Johansson are particularly sublime, in both what is said and what isn't said, considering the lengthy visual montages that occur throughout the film.  What might end up throwing some people off is Ms. Coppola's use of the camera and where she decides to put the focus.  She will, from time to time, let images slide in and out of focus and/or have the center of the frame far off from the action, catching bits of each event but never really focusing the scene on any one character.  However, taught editing saves this piece from spiraling downward into the realm of the visually incoherent, and the minimalist script fills in the gaps of picture/music/ambient sound nicely.  Overall: a well done sophomore attempt.<br />The Extras:  NO COMMENTARY TRACK!  This movie is screaming for a commentary track.  And yet, we don't get the pleasure of one.  So a lot of things that might have been explained directly from the horses mouth get left to confusion or, to put it frankly, &quot;lost in translation&quot;.  Sure, I think it's great to put commentary tracks on the big budget films and find out how difficult itwas, exactly, to blow up that big thing with the other big thing.  But I'm equally as interested to hear how it went behind the scenes of these smaller, artier films...how the director had to get certain shots, if they improved a scene a certain way or not, was it difficult shooting the Megalopolis of Tokyo, Japan, etc.  In my opinion, that's equally as interesting.  Word to the wise, Ms. Coppola: please don't go the route of Mr. Spielberg, give us our commentary. <br />Then there is the &quot;Lost on Location&quot; documentary on the filming process.  It's about 30-40 minutes long and has some interesting scenes on how shooting went down, some funny outtakes and tidbits of information.  But once again, it doesn't really go into any details.  It doesn't explain where she got the idea, why Japan, what the studios thought of the idea, what her folks thought, what interested Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  But at least it's quaint.  <br />Then there's the last worthwhile extra, the &quot;Interview Murray and Coppola&quot; - which is taken a year after the film and is about 10 minutes long.  It gives a small window into why the picture was made and some of the hard points of doing a picture like &quot;Translation&quot;, but doesn't really dig deep.  It's just an interview with bits of film footage cut in between clips of the interview.  <br />The Lowdown:  If you saw the movie and loved it or you heard the hype and wanted to see what everyone was talking about, then by all means you should totally get this DVD.  The movie, love it or hate it, is the kind of filmmaking that rarely sees the light of day in this &quot;popcorn thriller&quot; producer driven cinema world we see today.  However, if you're looking for a DVD that answers some of your burning questions or brings to light things you didn't notice when you saw it in the theaters, look somewhere else...because this DVD package doesn't even come close.  Maybe if it wins some awards we'll see a second release with a commentary track or two...but I'm not holding my breath.<br />`Revu
B00005JGAB|5.0|We all know that this was (and still is) one of rock's greatest records and a touchstone for much of the punk and indie-rock that followed over the next three decades. But,was remastering necessary? Did Stanley Clarke have a hand in this or what? The bass absolutely overwhelms Johnny's guitar on nearly all the tracks. Sure the sound is less muddy, but stick with the original release for &quot;The Real Ramones&quot;.
B00008ADPF|5.0|First of all, let me just say that the people who blatantly insult this record and act like asses usually have NOT listened to it. I've seen a few reviews that weren't in favor of the CD, but they actually listened to it and gave a well-written review with reasons as to WHY they dislike it. Others just say &quot;OMG liek niklbak suxorZ lisen 2 reel muzik liek metalica u jackass!!111q!!1!1!'. They're pathetic.<br />Now, onto the actual CD. A pretty solid CD, in my opinion. It starts off with an energetic, hard-rocking track, Flat On the Floor. A great way to start the album. After that is Do This Anymore, a great song overall. A great solo, good lyrics and a good tune, just an awesome song all around. After that follows Someday, the album's first single. A ballad-like song, it's not bad but there are better. I won't go through the whole CD, but one other great song that I'd like to point out is Because of You. Possibly the best song on the album, a great song and the lyrics are very well-written.<br />All fourteen songs are pretty good, and even if you were displeased with Nickelback's Silver Side Up, or were afraid to try because of How You Remind Me, you should still give this CD a listen. Nickelback has improved and have produced a great CD in The Long Road. The nay-sayers here who give this CD one star mostly haven't heard it. Don't let it sway you away from a great album by a band that's not given an honest chance.
0783235968|4.0|Field of Dreams was released in 1989.  The film runs one hour and forty-six minutes.  Phil Alden Robinson is the director and the Gordon Company produced the film.  Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Amy Madigan are the main actors in the film.  Field of Dreams was nominated for Best Picture of the Year.  The setting of the film is on an Iowa farm in the middle of a corn field.  The movie is set in the late eighties and the main theme of the film is Ray Kinsella's struggle with himself.  He struggles with his need to follow the voice he hears in the corn field, saving his home and farm, and his wondering about how he could have been better with his father.<br />The plot of the film is that Ray is told to build a baseball field and `he' will come.  The purpose of the field is to ease 'his' pain. The voice comes to him many times while he is working in his corn field.  The voice then continues to guide him to Terrance Mann, a famous writer, and to 'Moonlight' Graham, a former rookie baseball player that only got to play in one game and never bat.  After Ray builds the baseball field, his father's hero, Shoeless Joe Jackson, comes to play ball.  Shoeless Joe and seven other players where banned from baseball for life after it is thought that they threw a World Series.  Shoeless Joe brings the other banned players with him to play, eventually bringing many other dead players to have real games.  Ray brings men together to play baseball, but will one of them be his father?<br />This drama was filmed in color and would be rated four stars.  I would give it a four star rating because the film keeps you in suspense, wondering what the voice will tell Ray to do next.  It keeps you wondering about what is in the corn field and whether these players are ghost or not.  In the end, the field ends up easing everyone's pain.  Ray gets to reconnect with his father as a young vibrant man and keep his home, Terrance Mann gets to go with the ghost into the corn and write again, Moonlight Graham gets his chance at bat, and the other players just get to play the game they loved.  It is a feel good film!
B0000027I6|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best solo album released by Roger Waters. It outshines &quot;Radio KAOS&quot; completely, and barely edges out &quot;Pros And Cons Of HitchHiking&quot;. Of course, the quality of this album depends upon whether or not you like Roger Waters as a solo musician. For quite a few, Waters solo career is lack-luster, angst-ridden, artsy garbage. I do not share this view, and I believe that Roger's solo music is very unique, insightful, and brings more to music than impressive guitar licks and catchy rhythms. The concept of this album and the views put forth by Waters on this album are near brilliant. It's a good album to sit by yourself and listen to, but it may not be good to play at social gatherings or looking for something to &quot;rock out&quot; to. My only complaint is that the music, as a whole, doesn't really cut loose... most of it is too mellowed, but I feel the album's concept helps make up for this quite a bit. It's not much like Pink Floyd at all, but even still, definately worth a listen.
B000002L7J|3.0|My sister, a big Smiths/Morrissey fan who introduced me to the music in the 80s, doesn't think this album is even worth 3 stars.    How Soon Is Now is the best track, and for the original UK and European versions of the album without it this record gets two stars at best. The songs are just generally banal in comparison with Louder Than Bombs, The Queen is Dead, and Strangeways Here We Come.
0440237688|5.0|In a world where freedom and the past mean nothing, a young boy waits for his assignment.  Seeing through the memories that he had never known, he realizes that there was once color, animals, love, and war.  The community is blind.  They are told what to feel and how to live.  For anyone that loves the unreal, the things that could never happen, and the memories that make us human, this book delves into a blank mind.  It makes us realize that everybody is based on their past and their ability to change their own destiny.  This is an awesome book.
B000002L82|5.0|While Movement is an excellent record, the vocals and lyrics are like Joy Division watered-down. This record represents a clean break from the band's past, and more importantly, the songs are brilliant.<br />While the vocal ability of the singer is questionable, even with the heavy straining in Age of Consent, the songs are very appealing. I especially love The Village, Blue Monday, and Ecstasy. This record is one of the best of the 1980s. It stands head and shoulders above most other New Order records (especially Brotherhood), although Technique is pretty good.<br />The only sore spot on the CD is &quot;The Beach&quot; - which wasn't on the LP I gather. It doesn't belong on the CD - at least not without a big &quot;empty space&quot; between it and the true last song.
0425152251|3.0|this book does not spend enough time on the different philosophers and their beliefs. I would recommend books that just concentrate on one or two philosophers. However, this is an interesting read and good for an introduction to philosophers and their beliefs.
B000002L5P|3.0|It's clear that the band was not yet musically mature. Morrissey's vocals are weaker than on classics like the Queen is Dead and Louder than Bombs. The songs are musically more spare and not as strong.<br />This one is for big Smiths fans. The rest of us should stick with Queen is Dead, Strangeways, and Louder than Bombs.
0694003611|5.0|It is difficult, indeed, to find high quality books for young children these days.  GOODNIGHT, MOON has rightfully earned its \\"classic\\" status, and the availabity of this book in board format is an added benefit.<br />Eager, little hands are known for crumpling the pages of their favorite books.  Enter the board book -- voila!  Your two-year-old's chubby fingers can turn the pages with ease!  And so it should be with this timeless, sweet, and sensitive book about a little bunny who needs to say good-night to everyone and everything in his bedroom before finally going to sleep.<br />The perfect bedtime story is now available in the perfect format -- nearly indestructible pages (unless, of course, your child is prone to dropping things in the toilet) that will outlast his toddler years.  <br />Hip, hip, hooray for GOODNIGHT, MOON as a board book!<br />----<BR>Jill Schafer Boehme, Author of MY LIMA BEANS ARE ALLERGIC TO MY SPOON and Editor of MOMMY!

B000002LBH|5.0|This is a classic record that rivals the Queen is Dead, not as a cohesive album, but for sheer listening enjoyment.<br />Fabulous. This record was my CD of choice on long bus trips.
B000006OAM|5.0|I cannot believe some of the editorial reviews I've read about this album. Writers are so full of themeselves and seem only interested in seeing their &quot;cute&quot; little comments in print rather than expressing what they really believe.  Who cares if parts of Ophelia come across as pretentious or contain weighty themes or dark, sullen content.  Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful pieces of song crafting I have ever heard.  Period.  Especially the 2nd half of the album.  Isn't that what really matters? If you think Tigerlily expresses a certain beauty of emotion, give Ophelia a listen.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this album is hottttttttttttttt. too many skits but the songs are crazy. kanye west is the man
B000002MUW|4.0|I'm a big Madonna fan, but I don't automatically like everything she does just because it's Madonna.  I have to say, this is the Madonna album I always come back to.  To me it's where I had wanted her to go since her first album.  I like her doing R&amp;B.  I have a DJ gig where I play music from The Brand New Heavies, Soul II Soul, Lisa Stansfield, Joss Stone, Craig David, etc and this fits right in.  I love it when I throw on I'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER or SURVIVAL and people start bopping in their seats trying to figure out if it's new Madonna music or old Madonna they'd never heard before.  I usually go from Brandy's I WANNA BE DOWN right into INSIDE OF ME.<br />I think this album was highly underrated and I, too, am surprised by the fact that some of the best songs on here never made it to radio or even to live performances.  If you have a karaoke button on your Awia stereo, hit it when you play FORBIDDEN LOVE and her vocal goes into the background and Babyface is whispering loud and clear &quot;Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark, don't give into your desire, he will only break your heart.&quot;  It's pretty cool.  I'd love to see her venture back into this genre.  I thought it suited her well.  BEDTIME STORY and SANCTUARY do seem a bit out of place on this album, but they were a definite foretelling of RAY OF LIGHT.  <br />People love and hate her for her diversity.  She has done R&amp;B, Pop, Electronica, Rock, dabbled in country, Show tunes, and has some of the most striking ballads of our time.  We forget that she writes &amp; produces most of her music.  That takes some talent.  <br />I love that I've been able to give this album a second life in the club where I DJ.  I'm thinking of buying a few used copies to give away as prizes.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|If you're looking for something new and you like metal, then i suggest you look into this cd. It features great guitar solos and worth a buy. The songs are farely long with variety in them. Some songs may even stay in your head for days! Go ahead, try it! What is there to loose?
B0000029AL|4.0|i love this album b/c it sounds so &quot;unprofessional&quot; it kinda sounds live and has a little bit of a bluesy touch to it its great and &quot;movin' out&quot; and &quot;dream on&quot; are on it which i believe are some of their best songs!
0131103628|5.0|This is a compact book with a lot of kick. The authors are experts in their field. There are no paddings of fluff or handholding. Writing is intelligent and concise. Information flows from chapter to chapter with clear purpose. The examples are excellent, focusing on essential problems all programmers go through one time or another. These days I don't program in C much but rather use a more higher level language like Python,Perl,Java,Ruby,etc. If you're like me and benefit from these wonderful languages or environments then this is the book to thank. Because chances are, those gifted programmers who wrote the languages you use everyday probably built the corner stones of their skillsets with this book.
0553583182|5.0|This book is a great introduction to Murphy's simplified instructions on how to understand the way your mind works. We all know that our thoughts are tied into our actions, but most of us never consider that changing our thoughts can change our environment. But once we understand this, we can use it to our advantage. All of Murphy's books are quite easy to read -- and they are not just your typical &quot;positive thinking&quot; fare. The difference is that Murphy's approach is not only simple, it is scientific. When using Murphy's techniques, some people have amazing results right away. Others take longer. I have had victories and setbacks, but I am basically much better off in less than a year and I am certain if I pursue these methods I can make even more improvements.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|On first listen to Greendale, I soon realized why Rolling Stone included it in its \\"50 Best Albums of 2003\\".  It's phenomenal.  It immediately reminded me of \\"Tonight's the Night\\" meets \\"Weld\\".  I listened to this album a dozen times in the first 48 hours of owning it.  Then I watched the accompanying DVD of Neil playing the Greendale set solo and live in Dublin, Ireland.  I sat mesmerized for the hour and 44 minutes, and at times was moved to watering eyes and chills...an experience very similar to having watched Bowling For Columbine for the first time.<br />I have always held the theory that present day musicians peak before age 30, and are rarely able to recapture the muse that inspired the work of their youth.  I would write this trait off to fame, and the lack of anything powerful happening in the musician's life to really move them to create great works of art.  Approaching middle 30's myself, I've been secretly hoping that it's not the talent that has left them, just the inspiration.  The recent events of the World and our Nation have definitely inspired Mr. Young, and I'm happy to report that the talent is present, possibly stronger than ever.<br />Buy this album, watch the DVD (with the English subtitles on) and prepare to be moved and inspired.
B00018HU4U|5.0|i absolutely love this album. please be aware that this item is so expensive because it's an import. most imports cost 2-3 times more than a normal US album.<br />i got this cd for my wife and we took it on a road trip this past weekend... it was great... we listened to it 4-5 times over just to take it all in... i highly recommend if you liked the last album.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|AMAZON.COM SHOPPERS:BEWARE OF INSINCERE CRETINS LIKE &quot;FRED&quot; AND &quot;AUBURN&quot; WHO HIT THIS PAGE BY ACCIDENT AND DECIDED TO SLAM THIS RELEASE.  IT'S VERY TRANSPARENT THAT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY LISTENED TO IT.  I CAN ONLY PONDER THAT THEIR BRAIN DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY TOO MUCH NICKELBACK, COLDPLAY AND OTHER WHINEY, NOTHING BANDS.<br />Tommy never sounded better than in this hybrid SACD release.  I don't have an SACD player, but have played other Hybrids on my normal player, and have noticed a vast improment in depth, clarity and overall dynamics. Pete's guitar, John's bass, Moon's drums and Roger's voice NEVER sounded more remarkable.<br />The bonus disc is a winner too.  A few of the cuts are just the instrumental backing tracks.  I find myself doing Kareoke to them. Pete and Roger have nothing to worry about with regard to my singing ability.  The real treat is the studio chatter between Pete and Keith on track 7.  Absolutely hilarious!  This bonus disc is not just for avid collectors or completists only.
0141301104|5.0|The Witches<BR>By: Roald Dahl<BR>Reviewed by: M. Jen<BR>Period: 5<br />     The book is about a young boy (later on turned into a mouse) and his grandmother trying to get rid of The Grand High Witch and her fellow followers, also witches. The two of them and the group of witches happen to be at the same hotel, the boy and his grandmother for vacation, the witches are having a meeting to find ways to get rid of the children of England. The boy gets caught by the witches and he is transformed by the witches' magical powers into a little mouse. Together, the mouse and his grandmother hatch a plan to get rid of the witches and in the end, they succeed.<BR>     I really enjoyed this book because Roald Dahl used a lot of descriptive words and I could get an vivid image. The plot is really good and exciting. The story made me imagine what would happen next and it made me want to read more and I   couldn't stop reading it. My favorite part is when the boy realizes he is in the room full of witches! it's really funny how everything fits together but he doesn't realize it until it's too late. (The following is from the book.) \\"She's wearing a wig! She was also wearing gloves! I glanced swiftly aound the rest of the now seated audience. \\"Every one of them was wearing gloves!\\" Then he goes on and says, \\"My blood turned to ice. I began to shake all over. I glanced frantically behind me for a back door to escape through. There wasn't one.\\" That part made me really scared and I began to read like crazy.<BR>     The part I didn't like was when he was turned into a mouse and when the boy finds the three frogs. I felt very sorry for them becasue they were going to die. I also dont like Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. They are very rude and mean. I didn't liek the part when they mouse gets his tail cut off. That part was very horrible in my opinion.<BR>     My favorite part was when the grandmother talks to the boy about how to tell the difference about witches and women and when she told the little boy stories about witches and what they did with children. I thought that part was very intersting. I also like the part when the boy and his grandmother defeat the witches by turning them into mice. That part was very funny and i thought it was very cool. This is truly one of my favorite books i have ever read.
0679411585|5.0|I saw the movie first before reading the book.  However, I found the book is full of details that the movie couldn't bring.  You will feel the elephant grass around you as you read this book and truly appreciate those who have served in order protect our freedom.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Living in Europe has meant that I only discovered &quot;Firefly&quot; long after its demise.  The ending of the &quot;Buffy&quot; series presented us with a rather charismatic Big Bad in the form of 'Caleb' Nathan Fillion.  A quick look in the IMDB told me he'd worked on another Whedon show, &quot;Firefly&quot;.  At about the same time Club RTL, a tiny cable channel, was showing this SF-Western.  No sooner had it started or they cancelled it too.  The mind boggles.<BR> <BR>When you're presented with a Joss Whedon project, you know it's going to be interesting whichever way you look at it.  It's going to have a wonderful use of language (no-one does dialogue like Whedon), an uncanny ability to blend drama and comedy, a healthy politically incorrect attitude, a tendency to throw all preconceived ideas and predictability out of the window and a strong cast to deliver the plot.  What more do you want?<br />Then Fox and Club RTL go and cancel it. Oh well, I've pre-ordered the region 2 DVD-set despite seeing only 4 episodes. I'm sold.  The first one I saw was &quot;Out of Gas&quot;, which grabbed me from the first shot and kept me wondering until the very end how it all tied together.  Whedon took three flashback lines to tell the story - seamlessly.  Counter-balancing the angst of &quot;Out of Gas&quot;, &quot;Shindig&quot; offered a light comedic tone, showing character development with great dialogue.  &quot;Safe&quot; was perhaps a tad weaker, but &quot;Ariel&quot; was downright disturbing.  Here we touched on the core of what could have been a great epic story: the Alliance and the Blue Sun company.  Who are these men with Hands of Blue?  What really happened to River and what is she capable of?  Can Jayne be trusted and will Mal blow him out of the airlock?  Dark, dark episode and so brilliant.  Whedon was not allowed to tell the story.  Here's hoping that he will at least be able to make that movie!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Being of fan of the original novel and ecstatic that a musical was made from the book, I bought the CD the day it was available.  It is pure and simple magic.  Idina Menzel, who's voice blew me away on the OBC of Rent, proves her power and stands right up there with the superb Kristen Chenowith.  I've been playing the CD non-stop since Decemeber, and with great fortune and luck, I was able to see the actual Broadway show this past weekend...front row lottery tickets.  The power and majesty of this show cannot be conveyed on this CD, but it comes very close.  Seeing all these perfomers dance, sing, and act the songs I fell in love with cannot be described.  You'll have to see it for yourself.  There's not a bad song in the show or on the CD...these songs, standing alone on the CD out of context from the show, are enough to move anyone.  From Idina's perfect 'The Wizard and I' to 'No Good Deed,' from Kristen's comic songs to ballads, from their duets together (no two voices have ever matched better), and from Norbert Leo Butz's 'Dancing through Life' to 'As Long as Your Mine,' this CD is a definate to buy and share!
