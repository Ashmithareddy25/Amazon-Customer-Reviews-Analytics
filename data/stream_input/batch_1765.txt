B002QNEJT2|5.0|Great show and I'm really glad to have this in my collection. I keep it in a box behind the AC vent.... Just Kidding!! Seriously, watch this show if you have not yet done so, you will be hooked after one episode:-)
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Loved this movie!The story is so wonderful and the background is so detailed.It held the attention of all my Grandchildren aged between 2-9.We will watch this movie many times.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The book was good but the series should have ended with the originals. But it had good twists and an amazing ending, another good book by Rick Riordan!
B005DI9HPI|5.0|Love Love Love this book!  The story is so fun to read and it lets you escape to a life you want to live.  I love chick lit and this is a really great book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it!! it gets hard at the 9&times;9 but I almost beat it hardness but I still love it
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is captivating from start to finish. If you like fantasy/hero's journey stories you will love this. Rothfuss' Kvothe is a great character. You can't help but route for him.  I was so into this book I called in sick to work so I could finish it.  I have since told very reader I know to pick this one up. Imagine Harry Potter but with some stones in a tale written for adults.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Unbelievable concert.  The performers really shine. The original cast still has it after all these years!  Bravo! Worth every star!
034580404X|5.0|This series is far beyond just erotica...it is an interesting perspective on the relationship between men and women.  It was so good and even my husband read it!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is perfect for anyone who wants to game on the go.  This thing packs a mean punch being able to put so much inside it including the controllers and power brick.  The screen is big enough for an enjoyable gaming session and the sound is very loud if you crank it all the way up.  Brightness can be adjusted as you wish and they even include a HDMI cable to connect the console to the screen.  I've been watching this item for awhile and finally made the purchase on Black Friday when the price went down to $179.  I'll be taking this on all my future road trips.
B008602KQI|5.0|If you're a fan of the books, you might not like the movie.  But if you can get over knowing all the back story, the movie is enjoyable by itself.  I've heard some people, who have not read the books, say that they enjoyed the movie, but there were gaping holes in the character development.  That's what you get when you try to adapt a book which was narrated in the first person to a feature-length film.<br /><br />All things being equal, the movie has an interesting story-line, interesting characters, enough action to keep you interested, and a premium performance from Jennifer Lawrence that might just knock your socks off. The producers did an excellent job of depicting the poverty and desperation in the Districts, and a great job of depicting the Capitol as a grandiose, pretentious, albeit out-of-touch, power tripping place.<br /><br />I was disappointed in their choices for Peeta and Gale.  And equally disappointed that they portrayed Gale as slightly more than a platonic friend to Katniss.  Their friendship was as close as one can get without being romantically involved, but the movie made it seem that Katniss was aware of having stronger feelings for him - which she wasn't.  I was also disappointed that the ambiguity and distrust she had for Peeta in the books wasn't conveyed in the film at all.  She just seemed to go along with whatever he was doing, while in the books she was a far stronger (independent) person with confused and distrustful feelings toward him.<br /><br />I chalk it all up to the writers making the best choices they could, while chopping it down to 2 hours of screen time.<br /><br />What I absolutely did NOT like about the movie, in fact I disliked it immensely, was that they completely wrote out the part of Mayor Undesee and his family.  His daughter's relationship with Katniss resonated with me later in the story.  His sister-in-law's relationship with Katniss' mother had quite a lot to do with Katniss' mother disposition in life.  The way the mayor showed compassion to the people of his district had a lot to do with the tributes reactions to what they experienced when they toured the other districts.  I think those relationships could have easily been fit into the film, without seeming arbitrary or uninteresting.<br /><br />I waited quite a long while after I'd read the final book (for the 3rd time) before I watched this film - mainly to add a little buffer between the &#34;actual&#34; story, and the Hollywood version.  I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />I like the movie for what it is.  I love the books for how they made me feel.the mayor showed compassion to the people of his district had a lot to do with the tributes reactions to what they experienced when they toured the other districts.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and I'm so glad I can get it through my Amazon Prime since I don't have cable.
B001NLKT60|5.0|AMAZING, THRILLING, ENDING PUTS YOU ON THE EGDE OF YOUR SEAT! I can't wait to start the last book! WOW!
1401225756|5.0|I love this series and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I bought it for a just because gift for my boyfriend since he has never read this series by Gaiman. The book arrived quickly and in great condition.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Tremors was a hit when it was released 23 years ago and it still stands up today.  Its naturally humorous dialogue enhances the rapid pace and every actor in the film is believable.  The new blu-ray has  a razor sharp image and decent sound.  You won't be disappointed.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Movie chosen because of the great actors but they must have really been hard up for work to do this movie
B0058VW36U|3.0|My 7 year old insisted on having this but now it is getting too difficult for her.  I played it a few times.  It's OK.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|This item was purchased per request of someone in the department.  I will assume they wer satisfied.  I am the person who does the ordering for the department, not the person using the item.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|More scenes & longer episodes not to mention HD should be Standard. Netflix allows viewing the whole season as standard instead of $1.99 per episode.
B003N2DIYM|5.0|This item was pruchased per request of someone in the department.  I wil assume they were satisfied.  i am the person who does the ordering for the departmet, not the person using the item.
B0042ETJU2|2.0|The DVDs are fine but the movies leave something to be desired.  The action is fun but don't try to follow the plot too closely.  The first one is the lamest since the plot developed during the first half is thrown away and never discussed again.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|now if i could just get the internet to work so i could open it when i am at Church.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show, and I can't wait for season 3!  Fantastic cast, and the story is very  intriguing!  Keep them coming!
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Honestly I've been to busy to listen to it yet..But it's Christmas music and Rod..how could it possibly be bad?  :)
B0052SF6CM|4.0|Definately worth purchasing the entire CD!  Along with other chart topping hits that you are hearing on the radio, this CD also has many others that are just as fantastic!!  Many have been added to my workout playlist!
B000KJT8IG|4.0|I've never seen any of the National Lampoon's movie but my hubby & I collect Christmas movies because it's our favorite time of year. This was a really cute movie, we enjoyed it. Fast shipping, very good seller.
B007L6VR12|5.0|watched this movie last night,  wasn't quite sure about it based on just the title of the movie alone, never knew about it before last night either..  granted it seemed there was alot of mono tone voice and dry humor but in the end I found it to be an enjoyable movie with some funny parts yes despite what others here said about it.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is such a classic movie & a piece of my childhood. We just had to have this for our movie collection. It'll be great to show our children someday.
B003RNXIBK|3.0|The last album was the Relapse and this is the Recovery, but if we're referring to lyrical skills; Eminem is a rapper, after all; then the titles should be switched around. Relapse was a major recovery from the steady album-by-album degression that saw him go from the best famous rapper ever to just another famous rapper. It wasn't his magnum opus, but it was as close as he'd come in a long tme. This Recovery, on the other hand; created in place of what was originally planned to be Relapse 2, which wouldn't have made much sense anyway; has him taking a huge step backward.<br /><br />Hard to find, after just one year, is the witty wordplay that enveloped at-least some of the Relapse songs. But Eminem doesn't seem to care, or seem to be aware, as he repeatedly insists that this album is better than that one, as if that one, which scored a well-earned Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, was some kind of artistic mistake. Stans who liked that album will suddenly agree. So instead of taking drugs, raping girls, killing people and jumping out of the toilet while you're taking a pee, he's sticking to more socially-accepted themes like partying and telling the people he loves how much he loves them. The Proof tribute, as an example, with its cheesy synths and corny chorus, induces vomit, not tears.<br /><br />The silly accents are gone and that's a relief, but in their place is a stock delivery in which he yells each word out as if he's actually saying something impressive, which only works when he is. I'd actually like to hear him do a whole album rapping like he did on Tim Westwood's radio show, a few weeks before the release of this album, with Royce Da 5-9, who would've been a more appropriate guest rapper for this album than Lil Wayne. That's the Underground flow, which is just as angry but not nearly as boring and monotone.<br /><br />Surrounding these (boring/monotone) verses with bland song choruses featuring the top pop stars of the day; Rihanna's annoying voice has no business spewing hooks on an Eminem album; only make matters worse. But it's an unknown singer named Kobe and the off-key way he \\"yeah\\"s on the stupidly-titled Talkin 2 Myself that stands as the album's wackest, most cringe-worthy moment.<br /><br />The album's gayest moment is when Eminem admits, in what seems to be all honesty, to being \\"jealous\\" of Lil Wayne at some point during the last couple of years. And that's ironic because it's Lil Wayne he now allows to, as Nas would say, murder him on his own shit. That's not to say Lil Wayne's verse on No Love is anything special; just that it's surprisingly more impressive than Eminem's, which is basically a case of rapid-fire style over substance. I can only imagine the slaughter Royce would've carried-out.<br /><br />The decision to abandon the traditional album skits; leaving characters like Paul Rosenberg, Steve Bergman and Ken Kaniff missing in action; might've been a wise one, but, for the sake of conceptual continuity, their absence should've at-least been explained in a bar or two. Without their voices breaking the flow to say what they have to say, this sounds like some kind of departure album; the new direction I sort of expected Eminem to head in last year before I was pleasantly surprised with the Shady-inspired Relapse.<br /><br />He says his copy of that album is now in the trash. But I don't care what he says. That album, even with the accents, is much better than this one, which is lame and tame in comparison. Did I mention that Rihanna sings on one of the songs? If Relapse weren't released just a year ago, I'd think Eminem has lost his edge and is on his way to becoming one of the gay pop fluff artists he used to make fun of.<br /><br />\\"Critics never got nothing nice to say,\\" the high-school dropout complains at one point. But that's not true. His albums are often praised by critics. Many would place The Marshal Mathers LP among the best when it comes to rap albums. The idiots at Rolling Stone, kissing the ass of its money-spending readers, even went back and upped their four-star rating to five. So I'll add about this new album that the first song is nice and breezy, and there are some knock-out punchlines sprinkled about. The \\"flying-crayon/nine-grand\\" rhyme scheme is classic Eminem. But that's about it.<br /><br />marcellee.coming the ass of its money-spending readers, even went back and upped their four-star rating to five.

B00A1S0ITE|4.0|I basically follow Ian with whatever he's up to and this was worth the purchase...  I like that the guitar is a little more rock-y than other recent stuff, back to his trademark rhythm.  Amy's drumming tends to be a little clunky and on this album she occasionally tries to pull off some stuff that doesn't quite work, but generally the band chemistry is pretty solid.  You occasionally hear bits that harken to great Fugazi albums, which is never a negative.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the mix is really thin, I tried playing this in my car on a long drive and it was just really hard to hear and appreciate.  I have friends who record on relatively cheap equipment (basically a computer and a $300 mic) and they can get way better sound than this.  It basically sounds like a really good demo tape for which you would look forward to a proper studio recording.  Oh well, still happy to listen to this.
0061474355|5.0|I read this book for the first time in 6th grade, and I've been reading and re-reading it ever since. (It got to the point where my mother threw it out after finding me cooped up in the closet with it instead of my SAT study books. I've been meaning to go out and buy a new copy, or three to be safe, for the past few years now.) I'm in college now, but this book is still one of my favorites. Sabriel is a strong female character who I aspired (and still do aspire) to be, someone courageous and intelligent, one of the best female characters in fantasy. The story is a sort of parallel universe I could escape to, a perilous and dark world filled with the undead and evil, yet also filled with humor, adventure, and enchanted cats. I don't think I'll ever grow out of this series, and I can't wait until my little brother is old enough for me to subvert all of his hetero-normative concepts of fantasy heroes and their fainting princesses with this incredible series.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|I've have read a lot of the Jack Reacher novels - this one has been my favourite so far.  I loved the way &#34;more&#34; of his emotions were shown.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so addictive I check it everyday just to see what else I can create.  Make your own dragons or the combos suggested create your island and gain coins from your dragons daily.  most importantly have fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awesome! if u r a determined pony this app should be very enjoyable by pegasisters, bronies, and even little fans! GET IT NOW! I bet you will &quot;Smile, smile, smile!&quot;
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I like this app, it is a great game to play when I am on my break time at work. I fortunately got the app when it was a featured free from the amazon store, but would have gladly paid $2 for it. It takes some time to learn, and I would strongly suggest doing the tutorials and free flight modes first so that you can get the hang of it, but even after that there will be times where you end up as a fireball at the end of the runway. Don't let that discourage you though, you will feel rewarded when you make that landing. My advice is to be patient, since fuel is not an issue, if you pass the runway you can just turn aruond and try again. () I Love the game, it is the most used app I have on my tablet, and I hope there are more games like this one in the future.<br /><br />Update: I just traded my little tablet in for a new one and re-downloaded this game. Now it's even better because now included is an A-6, and the option to buy the AV-8 (bummer you have to buy it). Also included is a mid-air refuel mission, and it is challanging as heck. I would like to see the inclusion of a sea hawk helicopter and an osprey in the future.<br /><br />This issue has also been resolved in the latest edition (Thank you for listening):<br />My only problem with the game is the F-14 Tomcat, the wings switch is right next to the landing gear switch, so when you are playing on something smaller then a 7\\" tablet, such as a smart phone, 4.3\\" tablet, Ipod, etc. you will have a hard time getting your gear down or bringing in your wings unless you use a stylus, this could be easily fixed in an update by putting the wings switch in another location.
B006Z1XY7E|2.0|this is a band that is famous because it has a catchy song with an interesting set of lyrics.  It is not a bad disk, but boy is it unspectacular.  If I had the chance again, I would not buy it.  But, it is not a waste of money.  I feel bad giving it two stars, but it is not equal to other albums I gave three stars.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Video in really good and sound is very powerful....  Being a Led Zellelin fan, this is a must have set.  Get the Blue Ray though.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|This was an excellent disc and a great purchase.  If you love the movie, you have to get this.  Daft Punk did an amazing job of aligning the music to the movie.
1932100660|5.0|Very good health tips and live living tips as well....  This is well written and easy to understand...  I recommend it for health life styles....
B000TRZ28E|5.0|This was, I think, the first real cassette I ever bought.  I really enjoyed it then and, boy, it is still fantastic.  This is definitely a top-5 albums for me.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this is by far one of the best animated movies out there. i would highly recommend for everybody to see it. has many good lessons and it really is just absolutely amazing.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Overall, like most sequels, this film failed to live up to its previous movies. American Pie 1 is still the best and most original of the series. The stars and humor have lost their original effect and it is just a rehash of overused situations. Not worth the time it took to watch.
0345803507|4.0|This is a very entertaining book, although you learn what is going to happening. I do think it is a book for a dark rainy night.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|I'm not convinced this is as good as Atlas Shrugged, but it is very insightful into her free market beliefs and the rights of man.  It took almost the entire first part to &#34;get&#34; her thinking, but it quickly became clear in the Part II and throughout the rest of the book.  She is, obviously, a purest in the sense of man's sovereignty and rights, but the struggle of piecing it all together early on was a lot of work.  This is a good read - perhaps prior to reading AS - as it give you a good picture of her mindset.  I feel this is just a bit more superficial drama than AS, but still a great read.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Expendables 2 is really all about how may celebrity action stars they can fit into one movie and still give it some sort of continuity.  If you are an action junky, like myself, and you aren't considering this for your library, then you may want to start looking for quieter genres (like romantic-comedies or something).<br /><br />My only downer for this movie (seen in Theater and on BR), is that it seems to be a steady stream of LOUD with no real time for your ears to recover. Maybe it's just me, but the first one didn't have that problem.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think there should be just a few more hints. But other than that this game is the best ever.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I thought they did a great job on the movie!  I had just finished reading the book for a second time before the DVD came out, and I thought they set up the atmosphere of the book quite well.  I also thought the casting was well done and overall they stayed true to the movie.  Of course some parts were left out, but nothing that really changes the story.  Great movie, can't wait for the next one!
0316789798|5.0|I'll start by saying that I am horrible at drawing!  I know this book was intended more for children, and I got it for my daughter, however, it was fun for me also!  While some of my animals didn't come out quite as planned, some actually did, and for me, that is quite an accomplishment!  My daughter (3 years old) did her own version of some of the easier animals, but this is the kind of book she will grow into, so I'm glad to have it as part of her art kit.
0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - can't wait to read the next one- I am glad there is another one
0691143692|5.0|the publication goes by monographies every chapter. this makes it very enjoyable to read. I sent it as a present to several friends.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I tried several products to use my office files in my dropbox account.  Quickoffice is the one I mainly use, but this one will sometimes resolve things that Quickoffice has trouble with, so I keep both on my droid.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS ENTIRE SERIES TO ENTERTAIN MYSELF WHILE RECOVERING FROM SURGERY.  IT CERTAINLY HELPED ME GET THROUGH A TOUGH FIRST WEEK.  I WAS COMPLETELY ENGROSSED WITH THE PLOT AND STORY LINES... I LOVED HOW THEY INTERTWINED THE LIVES OF THE ELITE AND THOSE WHO SERVED THEM.  SO WELL DONE!  COSTUMES and SETS WERE JUST BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED.  OF COURSE THE HUGE HOUSE WAS THE BACKDROP FOR MOST OF THE SERIES AND WHAT A HOUSE!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Two smart phones, a tablet, two netbooks and a laptop always in sync with my most important files - without thinking about it!!!
0307744434|3.0|I'm sorry but I fell asleep on this one.  It had such glorious reviews but I felt the storyline seriously lacking in luster.  Everything else shined like some fantastical dream.  But beautifully written and designed sets do not make up for lack in plot.  By the end, I was just wishing the Circus would disappear as magically as it had appeared in the beginning ~  So it would just.be.over.  Took me forever to finish it.<br /><br />It kind of remined me of how I felt about the movie &#34;Hugo&#34;.  Absolutely gorgeous to look at but the story simply dragged.....
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Recomended.<br />This is a very quality thing.<br />Thanks for the oportunity and all.<br />To play many times for the next years, til the Crossroads 2013 not come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps the drama going and the hope for redemption alive.  Builds the characters for the end of the story line but keeps the hope and dream alive.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good show, good acting, and I love the premise. Sends me to bed wondering what I would've done. It's awesome!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not the ending that the romantic would want but more real than the story - definitely not a fairytale ending.
0061906220|5.0|You will fall in love with Pete the Cat! His positive attitude no matter what will make you smile and have you singing along to his song! Fun book to teach colors and cause and effect to little ones. I teach Kindergarten and my kids love Pete the Cat.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Haven't seen the movie yet but reccommend that you read the book first.  Deep and gory as it is up lifting and hopeful - leaves you wondering which story he is telling is the true one or if it really matters - looking at the mind of a 14 year old in a bad situation and seeing how he handles that struggle combined with his religious confusion - if that is what it really is.
0140282033|5.0|Loved this book. Savored each page. More mythical and mystical than the movie, I found it good to the last word. More of a woman's book, this lush work carries the reader to a fantasy world, almost a parallel universe, where we root for Vianne and her daughter. Character driven (with the village as one of the characters), I found the whole experience wonderful. Plot wandered a bit in places but I loved it anyway. Don't expect realism, this is magic!
0547884591|2.0|Expected so much more, based on his previous 2 books.  As others have pointed out this book is scattered, unorganized and just plain confusing at times. Yes there is a tip or two that *might* be useful, but by no means superior in any way to how I have been doing things all along. Read the first few chapters and scattered the rest - still trying to figure out where its all going.  Recipe wise - might be 2 or 3 tops that I will actually try, otherwise nothing great in here!
0446547654|5.0|I love all Nicholas Sparks books. I love the movies as well. I have the entire collection of his books in hardcover.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Downloaded this to use on a Lenovo A2109 tablet. It is nice for reading and has numerous Bible translations. Am still familiarizing myself with it so don't know about its capabilities regarding commentaries and other such features.
0425263916|5.0|I heard from a friend that this book was a must read. If its anything like fifty shades I'm sure I will be satisfied. The price was very reasonable considering how much the books cost in an actual bookstore.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|At first I was a real skeptic....but finally gave in to my 14 year old son and sat through the first two seasons and am now hooked!
B0029O08WA|5.0|I absolutely love all the music from twilight. I couldn't wait to get the music so I could download it onto my iPad, iPhone, and iPod.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Loyal, dedicated, and devoted fans of Soundgarden will love this album. Soundgarden reunited without showing any cracks or missing a beat. Soundgarden is one of the best bands-ever.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I was ecstatic to get this cd before the movie came out because I went to the all day marathon. I feel like I really connect with the music. I have it downloaded on all my music devices.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great for the whole family.  The kids loved it as well as the parents.  We rented this, but it is now on the buy list.  We will be watching this one for years to come.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I am a total twihard! I love all the music. It brings me back to the movies. I would recommend this to anyone who loves twilight.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Even though I found it a strange book, storyline wise, I couldn't put it down. Some of it made no sense to me and I did not like the ending; but, then again,neither does time travel. I would recommend this more to high school students.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Delivery was fast. I am also a diehard hunger games fan even though the movie was not as good as the book. I am satisfied with my purchase.
B003N0XDT4|1.0|No USA support, this thing is cheap, the USB cord fell apart, so you cant charge it. This is junk what a waste of money they shouldn't even sell this china company made junk if they cant offer support for people in the USA.
B00866JL96|5.0|I've wanted to buy this movie since the day I saw it. I just didn't want to pay twenty dollars. I saw the low price on this and immediately purchased it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is so much fun and find myself wanting more time to play but need to charge the Kindle.  Looking forward to more advancement on it with new challenges.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is my second favorite twilight cd being that breaking dawn part one is my favorite. It's nice to have this downloaded onto all my music devices and still have a hard copy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I must admit that I missed this app so much<br />LOVE THE QUALITY!I love this app!!! and I love youtube! perfect convination
1451696191|5.0|I bought this book and it was super good. I borrowed it to my friends and they loved it too. I highly suggest it, because it was amazing. :)
B007978NU6|5.0|I repurchased the book on my kindle to read it again before the movie comes out. It's the third time I've read it and I couldn't put it down. One of my favorite books of all time!
0525478817|5.0|Okay, so I got this book the other day, and I could not put it down. It is 313 pages and I read it in three days. Seriously this was the best book I have ever read. :) I highly reccomend it and I think EVERYONE should read it.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|And I just got tickets to see The Who!  I am super excited since they are one of the bands that I have never seen live.<br />The book was a great read.  I loved to learn all about how everything started for Pete Townshend.<br />Can't wait for the show :)
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I really love this.  It is good for someone wanting to learn basics on the piano.  Also it is fun.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've been a big fan of this tv series since it's inception. Season 3 continues to ramp up the things that made the first 2 seasons enjoyable to watch.<br />There have been multiple jaw dropping (no pun) moments so far this season.<br />I highly recommend watching if you've like what you've seen the first 2 seasons. If you haven't watched the first 2 seasons, what are you waiting for?
B0016BP0PW|5.0|There are a number of things to love about this film from the brilliant director Julie Taymor.<br />• the Beatles. The narrative power of their songs shines.<br />• the story meanders a bit at first, but when &#34;Let It Be&#34; happens, it grabs you, hard.<br />• Bono as the Walrus, who leads our young lovers on a kind of magical mystery tour.<br /><br />But most of all, the film has an emotional truth to it. As someone who lived through the times depicted in the film, I can vouch for the innocence, passion, and belief in the redemptive power of love that is depicted here.

0062502182|3.0|When I bought The Alchemist by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, I immediately thought of Borges or Garcia Marquez. This would be a reading journey filled with magic realism and deep truths. Instead it was a journey with Dr. Phil.<br /><br />The Alchemist is a tale of the search for enlightenment and the mystical magic to turn your life into gold. To find that elusive treasure you follow your heart and the signs that lead to your personal legend.<br /><br />The journey is that of a young, innocent shepherd boy, named Santiago, from Spain. The boy has had some advantages in his life, including an education. He is dedicated to his flock. He keeps them safe and watered and fed and together. He is not so wise to the world. He trusts easily, too easily.<br /><br />He meets a gypsy fortune teller who tells him he will find a treasure, but she requires him to give her one-tenth of the treasure when he finds it to offer him the next clue. The next clue comes from an old man who turns out to be Melchizedek, the King of Salem; he tells the boy where he can find that treasure--at the great pyramids in Egypt. The King requires that the boy give him one-tenth of his flock for this information.<br /><br />The boy has a habit of losing everything he owns on a regular basis. He also has a habit of earning it back and then some. Obvious signs or omens come to him often.<br /><br />Santiago travels, literarily through the desert where he meets the Alchemist. The desert holds the secrets to enlightenment like it does in so many spiritual journeys. The Alchemist encompasses all wisdom and knowledge. He guides the boy through the dangers of the desert as well as instructs and challenges him.<br /><br />There is resolution at the end. I don't want to spoil it, but I don't think anyone believes this a tragedy.<br /><br />Although the story is simplistic and not particularly well written, I do see why it has been translated into sixty-plus different languages. There is a something about a journey and alchemy and treasure and a person overcoming many obstacles to discover their personal legend that does cause small, longing pangs in the readers heart. But this is a young adult novel. I just didn't realize it when I started reading.rney and alchemy and treasure and a person overcoming many obstacles to discover their personal legend that does cause small, longing pangs in the readers heart. But this is a young adult novel. I just didn't realize it when I started reading.

B0000T70K4|3.0|Don Delillo is an amazing writer. His prose is sterling. Cosmopolis is The Stranger if Meursault were a zillionaire and lived in Manhattan.<br />It's the existential tale of incredibly rich boy, Packer, who wants a haircut, as he travels in his limo across Manhattan. The detachment of Packer leads to the sense of nihilism that pervades the novel and your heart as you read along. Packer wants to fall and bring down those closest to him that he feels are oppressing him in some small way. It may be the only way he can feel anything. He does appear to be searching, seeking a connection, but he has lost himself, and there appears to be no getting himself back.<br /><br />The story Delillo creates seems real and unreal at the same time. It's hard to imagine where it came from. I admire the tightness of the story. But the deadness of the characters left me unsatisfied. I could not believe they were doing the things there were doing. Even pain was an intellectual exercise.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book, but it is well written and interesting. But I doubt you'll enjoy it.
0385344228|5.0|This was one of our Book Club selections.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  The story really brings up a variety of thoughts and angsts within a parent and a female.  One of the best novels that I've read in a long time!!
1612185495|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Doctor No. Ian Fleming's spy novel's terrific plot, story and pacing made it hard to put down.<br /><br />James Bond really comes alive in a stripped down way when you're reading about him. Ian Fleming's Bond is not as dashing as Sean Connery and bears no resemblance to Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. I think Daniel Craig really captures the spirit of Bond as does Connery, of course.<br /><br />The unforgettable characters of James Bond, Honeychile Ryder, Dr. No, M strike a cord that reminds me of the Sherlock Holme stories. The fast-moving action weaves in important themes such as power and friendship and loyalty. Also, Honey Ryder is one of several Bond girls who have been scarred by rape.<br /><br />These serious issues combined with the wonderful and unique storyline and characters makes Dr. No timeless and a great summer read!
1401322786|2.0|The story is somewhat interesting regarding Father Time.  I spent the entire morning reading the book.  When finished, I felt that I had wasted such precious time sitting here reading rather than doing more valuable things.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was expecting an &#34;Alien&#34; type thriller here but was underwhelmed and even bored at times. I felt like the story lined skipped chunks of time and didn't really explain the motivation behind one of the main characters actions. Visually this movie was stunning in HD when streamed on my PS3. Amazon seems to have taken great care in the streaming technology. Both sound and picture were excellent. Just wish I could say the same about the story line. I give the story 2 stars and added one more for visual effects and sound.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Great songs well recorded, reflecting full artist range of this very popular modern master of song! Well worth listening to again and again.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I rented this move with not very high expectations. As a result I was extremely pleased with film.  Visually, the movie is stunning.  The streaming HD quality was excellent.  I was really captured by the storyline and enjoyed every part of the film. It has action, drama, thrill, and humor all packed very nicely.i remember thinking to myself at the end of the movie how satisfied I was and then wanting more. I would watch it a second time just to experience complete enjoyment in a movie. Keep in mind, this is a complete sci fi film. So, if sci fi isn't your thing don't expect huge results.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|Great sailing scenes and is there anyone better at playing the &#34;leader of men&#34; role than Crowe (Gladiator)?  Some of his &#34;lucky jack&#34; plots are a bit of a stretch but fun nonethless.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|While not their best album ever.. I was really surprised how much I liked this new Aerosmith release.  It is the their best album since Pump because there are 3-4 classic tracks (power ballads, uptempo rockers) that impress me how fresh the bands sounds.  Tyler puts in great vocals considering his age, and the gem is the duet between Tyler and Carrie Underwood \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\"---- wow, that girl can really sing... kinda wish there were a few more songs with Carrie since she's well-suited for rock n roll.  Bravo - a return of form for the band.

1476712042|5.0|I loved this book tremendously! I started wanting to read just a few chapters at a time but I couldn't put the book down and I devoured it in one night! Travis and Abby's chemistry was amazing even when they were just friends and I found Travis's nickname Pigeon absolutely adorable.<br />I'm pretty much a drama queen so I did enjoy all the drama and obstacles that the two of them had to over come in the course of the story, but at a certain point I had to take a break because there was so much fighting. It felt like at one point everyone was fighting with everyone else. That aside, it was a beautiful story with characters that I loved and I can't wait to read the story from Trav's POV!

B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|The trailer did a good job of hiding all the bad parts of this movie, namely the love triangle. The action element of this film was good and so was the pot/cartel element but the leading lady/love triangle element ruined the movie for me.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|It's sad to see that people who are trying to keep the integrity of food are being bought/sued/driven out of their purpose by large businesses that have no interest in selling low processed, healthy food.

B000H5TH1Q|5.0|I loved the acting in this movie plus all the twist and turns and the ending was a real surprise.<br />Melanie Griffith was very young in this one and did a good job as well as Craig Wasson.<br />You will love this one for sure, pay attention to all the details from the beginning to the end.

B00009RDG9|5.0|An action show that will have you sitting at the edge of your seat.  Filmed in Portland, OR adds to the beauty<br />of the scenes.  I would recommend this to men and women that love adventure at it's finest.

B000M341QE|5.0|I have never seen so many famous actors in one movie.  A hardcore true to life cop story and a very<br />surprising ending.  One of my all time favorite movies that I never get tired of seeing.  If you buy just<br />one movie this year, this is it.  Of course it is rated R for content but wow what a movie.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this enchanting tale. I have always had a fascination with the circus and the mystic of this story was an added bonus. I have and will continue to recommend this book to others.
0345803507|5.0|All three were fantastic.  It does not take sixteen words to say what I just said in the previous review..
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very dissapointed with this book. It was a bore and so full of stereotypical characters it was annoying.  Barely made it all the way through. Not worth the $$$but the cover art is cool so at least it looks good in the bookcase.
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed the books.  They make it impossible to put them down.  You want to know what is going to happen next.<br />E.L. James made the characters real and you thought you were in their story.  Just fantastic......
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. I found the story compelling and was impressed with how well it has fared in very different work technology wise since it was written. I was taken aback when I realized how long ago it was written but how well it translates to current technologies. Although the content could have been challenging (children &#34;playing&#34; war games) it was a thoroughly enjoyable read
B009KHCT94|3.0|65% of this movie was good to great, but the rest of it dragged it down into the mire. It was a camel of a movie -- a racehorse designed by a committee. The United Nations footage should have ended up on the cutting room floor, and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Still, there is a lot of entertainment value in it, and it would a good exercise for a film class to re-edit it (and perhaps do a little dubbing) and see how good a movie they could make of it. In the unlikely event that happens, I would love to watch the result!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Very good price- you really get the bang for your buck! Very good season and looks good in it's box set. Highly recommended for any Doctor Who fan!
B000002LRX|5.0|This is definitely a must own for anyone into music. Metal, alternative, whatever. You must own this record if you like music lol.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|Bought this for my mother because her computer will not read SD cards. It works perfect and is very easy to use! A great way to get those pictures off your camera or to read an SD card with any type of files on it at all! Also very good price. Highly recommended!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Worth paying for... love this series and the people. All the plot twists mean it never gets old. Can't wait to see Season 3.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|This movie is a family favorite. I've found my young teenager watching it throughout the year. This is the type of movie that has you quoting it and wanting to watch it over and over.
1451695195|4.0|This is a very difficult concept to present in a manner that the average person can comprehend.  The technical details presented in medical terminology will be a challenge for those not versed in such to understand, but the overall message is incredibly important to convey, especially to those families experiencing a loss or to health professionals dealing with these issues.  I found this book both informative and encouraging equally on spiritual and metaphysical levels.  Well done, Dr. Alexander, and thank you for sharing!
B0000714BP|5.0|Anyone who knows or has a Gay Family member should watch this. How one comes into his own and becomes being comfortable in his own skin. I do believe this is called life so enjoy it with an open mind-everyone that does Drag is not Gay don't be fooled it is a job that pays well for the true professional. Thank you
B008KE3960|4.0|A fun and addicting game, one of the better tower defense games out there, I think.  The only (minor) gripe I have is that there are certain things you can only do with an in-game purchase.  That being said, you do not HAVE to do any purchases to advance in the game (it's just slower).  And there are no ads, it's great!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|fresh, innovative, non-violent, law procedural with a twist that is compelling and amusing.  Corporate law has never been so interesting or entertaining.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Why is this never updated at the same time as in the Google Play Store? Terrible that we pay for it and it is so behind.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is back and I for one am thrilled with his return.  It is always a comfort to have an old friend return to the arena, putting his special skills to work solving the latest crime which has come to his attention.  This time the crime is from the 1992 LA riots, when multiple dead bodies appeared as crime and mayhem ran rampant.  The police, stretched thin and unable to properly investigate every crime scene must rush from victim to victim, doing their best, all the while being physically threatened by run amok criminals, looters and troublemakers.  One of the victims, a Danish war correspondent, is found in a dark alleyway, shot at close range.  Her killer is not found as the mayhem and lack of evidence provides the investigators no solid leads.  Enter Harry Bosch on the twentieth anniversary of the riots, who has been tasked with looking at the unsolved murders from that fateful few days.  Harry's dogged determination to bring justice for the victims is hampered by the politics of race and internal police department politics.  In spite of the obstacles Harry works the case, slowly and methodically finding long lost clues, tying them together, as he finally begins to identify and pursue the culprit and his associates.  This is a great addition to the Harry Bosch series which I found quite enjoyable.  For those who have never read a Harry Bosch mystery--this is a great introduction.  Read \\"The Black Box\\", then go back and read the series.  Highly recommend \\"The Black Box.\\"
1451695195|5.0|I read this book cover-to-cover in one sitting. I think it might have changed my life, and I can't stop talking about it with everyone I see. I needed the author to get &#34;scientific and technical&#34; toward the end of the book in order to reach me. I needed facts. I know that Eben Alexander used his technical arguments to convince his colleagues to stop discounting Near Death Experiences--or maybe that's just the medical professional coming to the surface in him. It worked for me. Suddenly, there is a calmness in my life. I certainly don't fear death anymore.<br />However, I think people should read the book and draw their own conclusions. This is one book that people should read (sooner than later).
B001JU4S44|2.0|Although not entirely without merit, this just did not meet my expectations from the first MI with Cruise.  Interestingly, MI-3 is the best of the three movies and I would give it a 3.5 - 4.0 rating.
1423140605|5.0|My son and I have read Riordan's books for years.  We had enjoyed them all and The Mark of Athena does not disappoint.  I highly recommend it!!
0547884591|5.0|As a cook for more than 50 years, I was curious about how one could become a chef in 4 hours.  After reading the book, I realized the book was much more than a cookbook.  It is about how to understand the process of learning, then applying that process in the best way to accomplish any new task quickly.  So if you want to learn to cook, but also want to learn how to do many other things, such as how to catch a pigeon easily or how to learn a foreign language from a few short sentences, I highly recommend this book.  I particularly liked reading about the various experts who helped Mr. Ferriss learn how to do things: everyone from world-class chefs to a Polish wino.  This is first class entertainment, with some darned good recipes.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Quite simply - if you're a comic book fan - the super hero movie you've been waiting for. For everyone else - this is you gateway drug into the world of comics. Joss Whedon hits it out of the park! Everything you want in a super hero movie - period. Excellent casting, story and effects. In fact, the effects are so good you forget they are effects and get caught up in the \\"hero\\" actions which is just perfect. And, for the purists - this is a new chapter in a divergent Marvel Universe. Joss Whedon and the team at Marvel have created a new universe just for the movies. Each of the prequels \\"resets\\" the history for this new universe. And they do a great job. Sit back and enjoy. I bought this movie in October and have watched it at least 10 times already. Can't wait for the next one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|when my little siser was playing this i was like whats that? when she showed me i was constantly asking her if i could play if i  could i would rate this game 4 1/2 stars because im not TOTALLY hooked on this game but i think it is really fun you should totally get this game its awesome
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Sanderson is one of my favorite authors and this is a great ending to the trilogy.  Highly recommend these books!
B005OLF6BI|4.0|The cd is pretty good and you can hear everything clearly, but I really bought this for the concert DVD. I wanted to check out a real \\"Speak Now\\" concert for a fraction of the cost. The camera angle switches so often that watching the concert becomes kind of unenjoyable. I still love Taylor though!

B009KHBDUU|4.0|In short, it was funny and had a loose knit to it.  I thought Depp would be like all his other Burton characters, but this one was just plain odd and original.  Not too familiar with the original TV series, but this one seemed to follow the teleplay lead.  Michelle Phifer was hot and the other characters were fairly silly.  I felt an eerie sense of mortality at the end.  It worked for me as I watched it around Halloween, so maybe it is a seasonal thing?
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I love this movie! It is definitely a Christmas classic that should be in everyone's collection.<br />Quality of product is great and the on time delivery made for a 5 star review.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Save your money and wait and see if a better Camera App comes out for your Kindle Fire HD,  This one is really not worth the money.  It is not a horrible app it is just kinda &#34;blah&#34; !

B005LAIHZY|1.0|I am sure the product is fine, but I waited online for more than 3 hours to try and buy Brave at the discounted rate. I wouldn't have bothered had Amazon not informed me that I had a \\"good chance\\" of getting a copy when I was originally waitlisted. I was able to see the percent of other deals that were being bought, but unable on the only one I was supposedly on the waitlist for with a \\"good\\" chance of getting. I waited there in good faith for 3 hours like an idiot but my \\"good\\" chance never came through and the deal just expired. PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD CONSIDERING UPDATING YOUR CHANCE AT GETTING AN ITEM AS OTHERS ARE GRADUALLY SOLD, THUS CHANGING THE ODDS. I don't enjoy wasting 3 hours under false pretenses.

B000FC146C|5.0|I'm not usually one for family sagas, but The Thorn Birds is absolutely amazing! I think I fell in love with Father Ralph as much as Meggie did. The Thorn Birds is much more than a tragic love story; it makes you contemplate human nature and all the things that make our lives what they are. You are made to feel the pain and happiness of Father Ralph, Meggie and the other main characters. Some books fail to make me truly care for the characters, but The Thorn Birds is not one of those books.
0316228532|1.0|I eagerly looked forward to Rowling's first adult novel. I must admit, I did not finish it. It is very well written but I couldn't like any of the various characters (and there are a lot of them). Quite frankly, I don't like books with f-words and cranky teen-agers and selfish housewives, and brutish husbands. So this could well be a classic book that stands up to the ages (like I said, it is very well written) but it is definitely not one that I want to read so I'm not going to finish it, except maybe the last chapter to see where it all ends.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|[[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer<br /><br />I was a big fan of John Grisham.  I am no longer a fan, large or small.<br />This book is so bad that I gave up mid way through.  The plot is incredible.<br />The dialogue mind-numbing.  The characters stereotyped.  And, worse, the author,<br />Mr. Grisham, continually changed his writing style from first person to the<br />invisible viewer.  I know this is a work of fiction, but Mr. Grisham's ideas<br />as to how the FBI, Justice Department, US Marshal's Service goes about their<br />business, is truly mind-boggling.<br /><br />Don't buy this book either in print or ebook format.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Bob Benson

B007IXWL2C|2.0|For all the hype about this book- I don't get it. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I would of been fine with the last book as it explained everything that the first two did not. I am 58 years old and when I read a book it isn't to read the type of things this book seems to be about OVER and OVER again. I took this on vacation with me (a cruise) and once I started reading it I put it down and finish it two months later. I was hoping that it would get better but it didn't. I agree with the reader who couldn't figure out how it stayed on the best sellers list for as long as it did. I won't be buying anymore of this author's books.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|The Mark Of Athena is the third book in Rick Riodan's Hereos of Olympus Series. It is an action packed novel that follows on from the Son Of Neptune. The characters travel in a flying ship across seas, through countries, weaving in and out of danger all the time.<br />The main characters are seven demi-gods,  Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Jason Grace, Piper McLean, Frank Zang, Hazel Levesque and Leo Valdez and one mad satyr Coach Gleeson Hedge, must follow the `Ancient Prophesy of Seven'.  The prophesy tells:<br /> \\"Seven half bloods shall answer the call. To storm or fire the world must fall, an oath to keep with a final breath and foes bear arms at the doors of death.\\"<br />Unlike previous Heroes Of Olympus books, all the main heroes are travelling together. It still has the same silly sense of humor like:<br />\\"Well done Frank Zang\\" Leo said dryly, doing his impression of Chiron the centaur. \\"That is exactly how people beat Chinese hand cuffs. They turn in to iguanas\\".<br />That is one of the many hilarious comments in the book.<br />This book would be suitable for children aged 9 and older because there a few lovey-dovey scenes in the book.<br />If you want to find out all the action in the book I suggest you read it!!<br />By Cecily
B007HACDLK|5.0|Action packed, I hope we have real people like Rapp, guess that is not possibe in todays PC world. We nned more Mr. Rapps today.
0547884591|5.0|The 4 hour body changed my life, now to this challenge, cooking. The spices to use with different dishes are really useful. I like the notes on the diet which is a cut out and is on my fridge. I made the scrambled eggs and they were good.  Looking forward to trying more.<br /><br /> Suggestions<br />I would like a ready to use shopping list, maybe something for the blog.<br /><br />How about some peri-workout recipes?<br /><br />Tim should check his e-mail more often (I kid, I kid)<br /><br />Great book
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom did it again. The idea was original. I loved reading the book and have recommended it to others.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is the first book of this genre that made sense to me, and I came away being very comforted, and believing in Alexander's &#34;Proof&#34;. I enjoyed his use of scientific facts to explain why his experience could not be anything but what it was; a trip to heaven. He has convinced the 20 per cent of me that isn't always sure about an afterlife. Well written, and when he finds out who his guide was, it will give you chills.
B008FLYM50|5.0|I already loved Marina enough before the purchase of this album, but wow. I love her even more. Marina sings what other artists don't. She sings about breaking out of the mold that so many people fall into. She is unique in her own beautiful way. The songs are full of synth, poppy and lyrics that speak of todays world. Songs on this album could just as easily be deconstructed in a college english class as they could be blasted at a club. Worth a purchase!
0061120073|5.0|I keep my favorite 100 books on a shelf next to my computer.  After reading this touching, bold, honest biography, I had to bump another book to find a place on my shelf for Smith's gem.  It is one of my all-time favorites.  R.K. Tipton
B008K8H9C6|3.0|fun for a little while, but nothing special, uninstalled after a while. it runs well though, but i don't recommend buying before trying, it's not bad, just not my cup of tea
0761119752|5.0|I don't actually need to look at this book anymore to read it. It is such a favorite in our house, that I have had it memorized for quite a while. It is such a fun and cute book, written with a really sing-song rhyming scheme. It makes the idea of getting ready for bed a lot more fun! Your toddler will enjoy having Pajama Time become part of their routine.
0547884591|5.0|I am currently in the midst of reading this gargantuan book.  No problem, as it's fascinating learning about the art of learning.<br />Thanks a lot Tim for releasing a comprehensive book on lifehacking principles that we can apply to everything in our lives.<br /><br />Hope bookstores decide to release this in NZ.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie has become part of favorite holiday traditions!  You will love this movie.  Its a must own.  Even my 4 year old gets it.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|You can not sit still while listening to Pitbull. He will get you moving!! Great music to clean with also. Keeps you motivated.
B0000028PI|5.0|Alice Cooper took 3 years off after \\"Hey Stoopid\\" failed to recapture the success of \\"Trash\\". In that time, he became a Christian and wrote the concept album \\"The Last Temptation\\". This is my favorite Cooper album because he touches on so many different subjects and \\"The Last Temptation\\" has a great story. There's just more substance to this record than his previous 90's album and Alice seems more focused than ever. Alice is a bit harder on this album, reminiscent of \\"Raise your fist and yell\\" but with better song writing and bigger themes. The story follows a boy named Steven who gets tempted by the devil to join his circus, where he'll never grow old or grow up. \\"Lost in America\\" was the lead off single and it's a great rocker. My favorite song on the album (and the second single) is \\"It's Me\\", an emotional ballad that should have been a big hit for Cooper. He always does great with ballads (\\"Die For You\\", \\"I Never Cry\\" \\"Take It Like A Woman\\"), something I feel get's over looked by critics and listeners. Overall, \\"The Last Temptation\\" delivers the goods and tells a great story about beating temptation and in the end has a positive message...something his follow up \\"Brutal Planet\\" lacks entirely.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|So hilarious! Great for kids and adults! Will Ferrell isn't my favorite but he is hilarious in this movie! I wish they made a sequel!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel with one of DeMilie's most humorist homicide detectives John Corey of &#34;Wildfire&#34; and &#34;The Lion&#34; fame. He also includes another DeMille character in his cast John Brenner from &#34;General's Daughter&#34; and &#34;Up Country&#34;.  Another serious plot with a lot of laughs, classic DeMille. The plot is very current and I learned a lot of history which is also a plus. Very good read.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|I didn't get to finish watching! I think amazon should allow the rental to last 24 hours OR until it has played beginning to end.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|If you haven't seen this one yet...watch it!!  A great flick with wonderful acting in all roles!!  Seen it a million times and will see it a million more for sure!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This was a great price - I find this game in stores for anywhere between $30 - $50! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! The game was brand new in the packaging and there were no issues or manufacturing problems. It's such an addicting game!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Great musical!  Love the songs, the dancing...all of it!!  The story is a good one and a must see for young and old alike!
B00011D1OA|5.0|Brand new, still in cellophane packaging! I bought this for my best friend for her birthday - she couldn't believe I got it online, it looks like I went to Barnes & Noble and paid extra for a special edition! Arrived just in time, well packaged.
B006FE83UE|5.0|This movie is in my top ten list!  A great movie and a great story to share with your children.  I've seen it a million times and will likely see it a million more!  Just saw it on the big screen a few weeks ago and it was like seeing it for the first time...highly recommend that you see it on the big screen if you get a chance!
6305537321|5.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas - it's a must-have for every family DVD collection. Any Audrey Hepburn movie can be watched again and again and is never tiresome!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Kids enjoyed this movie and was a hit for sure - I think they watched a few times, my little son loves super heros
0783225857|3.0|It was never specified that this DVD was widescreen. I hate widescreen. It also was described that the disc was in very good condition, which it was not. It was scratched and had bits of food on it! It skipped so much my boyfriend and I couldn't finish watching it! The only reason this rating doesn't get a flat out 0 is because I was refunded and was allowed to keep the useless disc, which at least saved me the trouble of having to send it back.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is one of the better ones from John Grisham.  The suspense was pretty good.  There was no clue as to where this book was going.  I finished it last night.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story is well written and makes you ponder, well done! A quick read, the book didn't let me down .
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I love this new album, it's almost like a cross between the albums The Black Halo and Ghost Opera, Tommy Karevik is definitely a good fit for the band.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Not much more then a search game.  Not alot of mental challenge.  Too much lame dialog...just keep tapping the screen to speed through it.<br />Kids would be able to handle it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Excellent package. I know that the 1st Alien might be vintage and slow if you compare with Prometheus. Even the special effects are simple but I doesn't shows extreme signs of aging. When you watch the deleted scenes and watch the extra discs maybe you reach my conclusion. Aliens, Alien3 and Alien resurrection are disposable. Alien franchise must stop with the 1st movie. Truly masterpiece. If the cocoon scene has not been deleted an Alien Queen might be unnecessary and the original Ripley might be still living in our minds and the stupid Alien Versus Predator never exists for our grace.<br />H.R. Giger is more frightening than any alien. He is so clever and bold but he might say every day Mirror mirror on the wall who is the spooky of them all... And the Mirror might be speechless indeed.
B0083TSVYW|5.0|I have the audio books for the entire series and I have to books as well. They are amazing and I share them with everyone I can!!! My entire family loves them. Perfect for listening to on long drives as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I looovvveeedd it so much. Kept you hooked on every page. Recommend it to every one I know!! : )
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I watched this film early in the cinema and I was quite shocked by the depth. The film has three characters who are bought about in friendship due to a bizarre, borderline alien encounter that nearly costs them they're lives. So the real fun begins with pranks and stunts that will have even the most be-there-done-that types laughing along with the characters. After some time and a few serious events the film takes a dark turn and I felt genuinely scared. That is what I loved most about this film,the main characters are extremely likable and remind me of the dumb stunts I did in school, you laugh at the funny bits, you cry at the sad ones, so on and so forth. Chronicle blew me away for a film in the Found Footage category.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|While hardly a cinema masterpiece, it moved quickly with lots of action as well as intermingled doses of humor. A great escape is one suspends one's disbelief. It is fiction after all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|download now!! because its awsome. plz buy it. this is an awesome game bad controls. its the best game ever.
0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch has always lived his life behind the eight ball trying to get through the politics and make sure the dead have a voice. Now that he is working on cold cases his values stay the same especially when the one that comes across his desk was one he had originally worked but had to abandon.  During the riots Harry and his partner were moving with lightning speed from one murder scene to the next, but the one that would not get out of his head involved a reporter who never fit the crime scene for that time and place. The reporter had been murdered yes, but her being in an alley where only death resided never fit in Harry's head and walking away from it made his remorse weigh even more on his shoulders.<br /><br />Now that Harry can work toward solving this murder even with inconclusive information, a huge roadblock comes in the form of his new supervisor. This is by no means the first person looking to kick Harry to the curb and it will not be the last even though this one seems to be a little sneakier than his predecessors were if that is even possible.<br />Pulling pieces together is what Harry does best and maneuvering around the new LT is a distraction but in no way a problem, he will not handle.  The deeper that Harry digs the more he uncovers clues that on the surface have no connection but being the master at connecting the dots is what Harry is known for.  He is a dinosaur where technology is concerned but good old fashioned research and the ability to follow a lead regardless of where it might take you is what helps Harry close the case and let the dead rest in peace.  Now if Harry could figure out how to get his personal life in order he may just take a day off.<br /><br />When a reader looks for the complete read in one book Michael Connelly always delivers.  You will try to find another writer that delivers with such intensity but it will be hard to find after you read just one book Michael Connelly has written.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Amazingly adorable movie, my husband even loved it. The bears and animals make this movie so worth it. Thank you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! The first levels are easy enough to give you a feel of thr strategy necessary to  complete the more difficult higher levels. Hard to put down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this abb is one of the best I have down loaded I think more people should play it or you could at least try it. I recomend this abb to anyone how well just what's to have fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book loved the movie and the book couldn't picked a better one read thank you for the great read
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The book series was by far one of the best reads I have come across, and when I came across the movie I already had my mind made up.  Compressing the three books into this single film sure had its downsides however.  Much of the detail that brought emotion from the books was omitted in the movie, but the important facts and heartwretching moments were all preserved.  This movie would make a perfect candidate for any movie collection, any family, and would be perfect as a gift.
0307742997|4.0|I received this on a Thursday and finished it by Saturday-- I couldn't put it down! It has so many twists and turns that when I finished it I immediately wanted to go back to page one and start over. If you like crime fiction Nesbo is hands-down one of the best writers out there.
B006O6EOII|5.0|my nieces love these dolls and so do my cousins, they went crazy over these dolls and absolutely love them. my nieces are 6, and 9 as for my cousin she is 12 going on 13.She actually like to collect them. they can get very creative with these dolls as well. Overall it was a great gift, and made me a popular auntie. :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Glad you have new games. I'd love some explanations and hints. But, it's great. I'd like to find out how I can download the PAID for one on my new Samsung tablet.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! The book kept you on the edge of your seat. Christian Gray is the new Channing Tatum!!!
1400032717|3.0|I thought I ordered a story about a boy doing detective work concerning a dog. The dog was only a small thing, the book was about an Autistic boy, which was good and interesting from that perspective. Along this line, he went off on complex math issues, which I skimmed. Actually, I skimmed a lot of the book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell has been a passion of mine since her first book. When a new book of hers comes out I am there on day one to grab it. However the last few have caused my assessment to beep down a few points. Kay Scarpetta is such a sharp woman, intelligent, beautiful and all that so why does she agonize over her imaginings of other people's motives? And page after page of this mental whining gets to be too much. Its hard to believe that a woman who is so exacting in her work, so clear on assessing other people's motives can be so poor in her own judgement of her personal arena. And she goes on and on ad nauseum. The plot of this story is great, the description of the giant turtle caught up in nautical garbage is exciting, the forensic details she always gets right are fascinating. I don't want to be a spoiler so I will just say that you will guess the ending because it has happened so many times in her other stories. Nevertheless, when I finished I had a good feeling that I get after a good read, even with all its shortcomings.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I would recommend this book for anyone who likes details and war scenarios.  It was okay but I enjoyed reading about the people involved more than war schemes.
B007JMW46U|3.0|I've read and enjoyed all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Kindle edition is handy for a quick reread.  It's still as Doyle wrote it;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much. Y'all should put tracks on it though.  But other than that I love it.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|This is my most favorite manual nerf gun in the whole world. The bolt action works great, but if you are too vigorous, you might break the bolt. Another thing to do once you get the gun is to never put on the front barrel. I find that it limits the range of the gun. Another downside is that once you attach the stock of the gun, it does not come off again... easily. You have to be very forceful if you want it off, requiring you to take apart the gun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Catches your attention and does not let go.  Excellent book with fresh ideas. You come to care very much about the characters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are addictng and some are just like &quot;can I beat this already?&quot; but its a cool app overall
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great storyline, excellent characters.<br />No more words required.  I said what I had to say.  Done, done, done, done, done.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I have read this book several times and really have enjoyed it.<br /><br />The first time I read it, I really didn't know who the character was or how the story would end.  I love reading books where I don't know what is going to happen.<br /><br />Ludlum did a tremendous job of developing his characters (Jason Bourne, Marie St. Jacques, the Monk, Alex Conklin, etc.).  It wasn't until the very end that I really understood what he was trying to do with his characters and he kept me reading well into the night trying to find out.<br /><br />Too bad the movie never followed the book!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I read it because I invested in it - but otherwise I would have set the book down.  Not a quality book by any means.  So disappointing!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|i love this album. I was actually very impressed with this album. Its one of the main reasons i have become such a huge fan! They are very talented and make good music. its very good, you will definitely put it on repeat!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this as quickly as I could - because I couldn't put it down.  This was an awesome series.  A little disappointed because it ended so abruptly.  Kind of left an opening for more in this potential series and I sure hope it happens!
B0095J0AL6|5.0|one direction's second album did not disappoint! its amazing and i love it. this album really shows how talented these boys are! i love them and i cant wait for more!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Bill Murray plays Phil, a grumpy news reporter stuck in a town repeating the same day over and over. The stuff that happens to him throughout the movie will keep you laughing.
B0097AQEOK|4.0|This Joni box set was long over due. I am disappointed in the cardboard album's.<br />The outer box is very nice but the individual albums don't look good to me. They really<br />can't hold a candle to the Japanese Joni Mitchell Mini LP's. I'm going to use this USA box<br />to store all my Japanese Joni MIni LP's. Sound quality is very good as expected.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ilove this game gt it last year and still playing it but halfbrick studios should really make more games other than this and fruit ninja
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|A great cast, lots of violence, but terrible dialogue and a general sense of wasted talent. I hoped for more.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Cohen was fantastic and in better voice than i expected, being a dylan fan and we all know what happened to his voice...<br /><br />Musicians and back up singers were in fine form also.  the crowd was really into this concert and very appreciative of the bands efforts.<br /><br />Thus, i ordered this CD along with Essential Leonard Cohen 2 CD set.  Reliving memories from the concert--especially enjoy \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" and \\"My Secret Life\\".
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was slow, sometimes redundent, i did not like the style, one character always talking about himself/herself.  I had a hard time staying awake while i read this, consept was hard to believe
B0046ZG2VG|5.0|i loved this film, this is the first film i bought for my 600, we were so excited for the results and they came out amazing!!!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|There's one central theme that runs through the Daniel Day Lewis character's life: financial success at any cost! He wrecks every human relationship in his adult life. He destroys his health! He suppresses his sexuality. (It's obvious he's gay since he shows zero interest in women.) But he can't let any intimate relationships get in the way of success! He rejects his only son over something so trivial it would be laughable under different circumstances. He admits he's full of hate but does nothing to rid himself of such feelings. He even rejects God and all religion - because he believes in nothing but himself, which is a recipe for disaster!<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's a perfect example of the Protestant Work Ethic. He works hard, very hard. He has the single-minded determination to become successful. He's intelligent and knows how to manage people. He's well spoken and very clever. He successfully manipulates both church and the local community to do his bidding. But in the process he damages the natural environment in orders to make his wealth. He steals from others because he can get away with it. He uses an innocent child to gain leverage with those around him. Literally anything goes in order to be a financial success.<br /><br />False religion is the other side of this story's coin. Again the Protestant Work ethic is portrayed as doing whatever it takes in order to succeed. This time it's a preacher who has his eye on the big time. He too knows how to manipulate people to get the wealth and power he wants. While he does not kill anyone like the self-made business man does, and certainly does not deserves his fate, all God means to him is a way of making great wealth. In the end, when that wealth fails him, he admits for the very first time what a foul human being he truly is!<br /><br />This is a very dark cautionary tale about the destructive power of greed and believing in \\"the ends justify the means!\\" What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become so profoundly corrupt. These two men did not have to become evil in the end! They could have used their success to the benefit of others - something they apparently never learned how to do! But all they cared about was themselves, which, in the end, led to their mutual destruction!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:1400075661 Age of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present (Vintage)]] and [[ASIN:B004AYCX98 One Simple Act: Discovering the Power of Generosity]]reacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become so profoundly corrupt.

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I realize movies actors need to make a living! But big stars like Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of themselves - they can pick and choose their projects. Memo to Their Hollywood Agents: You are ruining their careers! If dreary, campy films are all you can find for them to work on then maybe you shouldn't be in the movie star agent business!<br /><br />It's too bad there's not a law in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of the movie going audience!!<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this godforsaken, awful story! The good guys teleport (A mutant power rip-off from the X-Men). The bad guys are religious nuts that kill the teleporters in cold blood because \\"only God should have this power.\\" Simple as that! Each group tries to kill the other. The good guys are all really sexy looking guys and gals in there 20's! All the bad guys are about 20 years older and could be the good guys parents! And in one case, the bad guy is a parent! One of the most memorable lines: \\"When you were five years old I had to either kill you or leave you. You shouldn't have come here (parent's home), but I will give you a head start.\\" What a pal!<br /><br />When I heard this line I thought to myself, \\"how inspiring!\\" Parents are all defective or crazy religious zealots or non-existent. Religious people are all fanatical killers going back to the \\"Inquisition.\\" Only narcissistic 20-Somethings are the heroes in the world of Jumper. But even they are so narcissistic, that when the Christmas Eve Tsunami hits the Indian Ocean nations of the world, does our hero, Hayden Christensen, go and use his incredible teleporting powers to save those drowning before his eyes on the T.V. news? Nope! He grabs a surf board and teleports to some Pacific Island country to surf those extra powerful waves! How disgusting and shocking! What are the writers of this story trying to tell us? That young 20-something adults are so gross they only care about themselves? So in a real sense, there are absolutely no good guys in this pathetic film!<br /><br />I hope those responsible for crafting this demoralizing trash get kicked out of the Writers Union! I'm sure there are plenty of talented writers in the world who can churn out a decent story, and would give their eye-teeth to break into show business!

B009S8PEHY|4.0|majority of songs were great. one I did not care for,that one was very boring.got this album at a great price.Thank you Amazon.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Great game, great graphics, AWFUL COMPANY! The graphics are better than you see in the pics, the online part is amazing. Overall AWESOME game. But gameloft are a bunch of cheap businessmen trying to scam you out of your money. I would say, buy this game its worth $7 but dont buy in-game products, its very easy to lose track...i lost over $100 due to ingame purchases most of which didnt even work.
B007SGM084|5.0|They have a great story to keep you wanting to read, even if you're not into all the exotic romance.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|it was an okay book... some things didn't make sense but I enjoyed the story. It was a little too short of a book... I would have taken another 100 page for this price
B003L77G8I|5.0|This is one of our favorite shows. And we love to be able to watch them in order. This was our favorite season so far...because Bones and Booth will get together.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Great size for DSLR camera, very practical and well made. I would highly recommend it for everyday use. Not a lot of compartments for accessories, but the two it has are mroe than sufficient for charger, cables cleaning supplies and a few filters...
0446691437|4.0|Easy read, has some very good parts, but it also can be quite boring and repetitive at times. Definitely worth reading, even if you are just skipping around the book looking for some motivation. The benefits of reading it, even though you may not realize it at first, is that the ideas he plants do stay with you, and help you getting through resistance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Completely injoyed the story in the books from first to last. Loved it so much that I had my husband read it also. He also enjoyed the story line
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|a great game for the money, i would recommend it for for anyone on a budget or wants to be entertained while waiting
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. after reading the first one just had to read this one also. On to reading the last one.
030746363X|5.0|I love Tim Ferriss...he has inspired me and improved my life.  I own all his books and am an avid reader of his blog.  Valuable information can be found on every page regardless of your health goals.  My body has benefited from his wisdom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to read the other 2 books in this series. If you take out most of the sex parts it is a great story.
B00881PPTO|5.0|hopfully amazon can do two apps free daily 1 is a gaming and the other is a tools app if this happens I'll be a heck of a good camper
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love playing this and building a village of animal families. it takes strategy as you need acorns or coins and blue coins or hearts to buy and build what you need. Awesome!
B0086700CM|5.0|AMAZING. it is the best game I have ever seen. it is so addictive. I would definently get this game if I were you.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Fun game, but it keeps asking for money, which is a pain when you have kids that want to keep playing. It also stopped working on my tablet and I had to uninstall it.
B001LOU8ME|5.0|a great show is recorded on here & should not be missed by any schenker fan out of sight mike at his forever rising high point
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a good game for my 4yr old; we love doing &#34;coins&#34; together; however some of the items they are wanting you to get is either hard or too pricey.  You have to do these goals which is fine however some of the items in your goals wants 20-30+ acorns and you have to pay a nice little chunk (considering its a childs game) and I dont see myself paying for that.  Otherwise it has been fun for us both.
B001RT89UG|5.0|michael is one of the great guitarists of all time,incredible to listen to,& see live,this album is a perfect example of what a great player he is.totally smokin'
B00877R85I|4.0|I had no desire to read this book nor see the movie. I am no fan of fiction, and by the advertisements for the movie, I thought this book was some modern day worship of Collectivism and the State. That could be furthest from the truth. My sister insisted that I read this book as she placed it and it's 2 companions, \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\" in my hands. Always up for a reading challenge, I accepted.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a very easy read and equally entertaining for all ages. Though the concept is incredibly violent, the content leaves the reader to his imagination in many scenes. It is a story of a young girl and her struggle for survival, but there are also subtle undertones warning of the dangers of an authoritative State. A fresh breath of air for these days and times.<br /><br />I immediately watched the movie after reading the book. The movie is a terrible disappointment if you have read the book. If you have only seen the movie, I would recommend reading the book because you've missed an intriguing story.
B002JIEYLW|5.0|this disc is fabulously remastered,I'm super happy,I saw this concert at MSG in nyc amazing,& the disc took me back to one of my fondest concert memories,all out perfection,don't pass this by,metal heads
B001DJLCRC|5.0|best show ever. good viewing for men and women.well worth the purchase price.start at the beginning. each season gets better.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Movie is very entertaining<br /><br />Problem was the streaming,<br />The movie stopped several times due to lack of bandwidth, I tested my internet  speed immediately (Ethernet to the modem) to be more that 10Mbit (15 peak) every-time it froze, so I believe the bottleneck was on the server side of amazon.<br /><br />I guess is better to get the disk on redbox or try the non-HD version next time, as the 2X extra cost for the convenience of streaming  was destroyed  with the extended pauses, I don't know why they do not increase the buffering on streaming
B008COD5OO|3.0|Somewhat over the top at times but other times believable. Decent acting and not for kids, not just for the sexual content but you don't want to give them any ideas!!
B008JF8O9M|4.0|Loaded this app on my Kindle Fire and have to say when I tried it out it worked very well. I would say get it and I think you will like it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|OK, so it's not true but what if it were? Ben Walker could be a young Liam Neison. Great action scenes especially with the train on the bridge. Somewhat predictable regarding how his son died. But overall, good entertainment. I enjoy this better than any reality TV show!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Great app that is fun to make custom to your needs. I enjoy this app very much and it even lets you put your Instagram feed in. Awesome!!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Love this movie, plus mathew mc. Is such a great actor. I'm so Glad I have this ovie now, seen in the theaters and knew I had to ownit.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I enjoy the game. Now I dont have to wait for an opponent. Picking up the game after many years. I do wish it had a tutorial and a window to show which pieces I had lost. And a choice of sound effects would be cool.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Blue ray is amazing! This will always be one of my favorite movies, even withtheir unibrows still intact. David Bowie is amazing.
B006S053K8|4.0|Sincere, funny, and very true to life feeling, this movie is a nice nostalgic look at young love, and it's a treat to see that Kristen Stewart can put in a very good, and likable acting performance.
B004QSQMKE|3.0|When I purchased the directors cut I should have read what I was buying. I did not realize the music score for the dress dance scene wasn't the same until I watched it, also some of the scenes from the original theatrical version were missing that bothered me. I will have to get the ultimate version instead.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is as good as the game that was brought out on cell phones.  Will recommend it to my friends and relatives.
B000YHG72E|4.0|It's silly and a little corny, but it did make me laugh.  Will Ferrell is a riot.  Not much of a spiritual outlook on Christmas, but rather in the &#34;Christmas Spirit&#34; as it relates to what should be important in our lives (family over ambition) and belief in the big red guy.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought this one for my wife and she loves it.  She hasn't dropped her phone in the tub or sink yet but she says it's great!!  She did mention that she wished I could have gotten her the same case with some \\"bling\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just plain solitare, nothing fancy, just the way I like it. Big and easy to read numbers for us aging folks
B008S4FZHI|2.0|I'm not sure if I've outgrown the Scarpetta novels or if Cornwell has lost the knack either way, this was a disappointment. To be fair, the last four or so in the series have left me feeling less than satisfied.<br />The Bone Bed was not the page turner of the early Scarpetta books. This book was readable but little more.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|At first I did not understand this album. It seemed like all the tracks were depressing, so I listened for a second go round and I must say after listening to the lyrics I love this album as much as the others. Now most of the songs made me feel like she was singing directly to her lover (who will remain nameless). This album is almost a plea from the heart. Now there are some favorites such as &#34;Diamonds&#34; & &#34;Fresh off the Runway&#34; that are hits. I also like her collaboration with Ginuwine's classic hit &#34;Pony&#34;. With this album you experience the more creative side of Rihanna's music. Definitely a maturation of her music and talent.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|A great quick factual read for lovers and non-lovers of history. Reads like a history novel. I loved it!  Everyone who borrowed it loved it also. I might read it again in the future.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|If you need or want a battery app for your Kindle Fire Hd, this is the one. Has many settings if you choose to use them including a way to calibrate your battery. Looks good as well. Highly recommend.
B00275EGWY|1.0|No value at all!  Was not researched well that is obvious! This is an insult to those that served in OIF I was there in 08-09 during the surge in an Infantry Rifle Platoon. Here are few bogus things about this movie. Don't waste your time or money with this garbage.<br /><br />1) Single Vehicle convoy yeah right! They would have gotten there asses rolled up 75 meters out of the wire!<br />2) 3 man EOD team clearing houses this should be done at Squad Level at the minimum.<br />3) SGT knocking out a SFC no UCMJ or reprisal yeah right!<br />4) Numerous uniform infractions wrong patches you don't wear CIB's Air Assault Badges in theatre.<br />5) 3 Man EOD unit out Shooting a SAS type unit of superior numbers NEVER!<br />6) Gun truck's with no Crew Served Weapons stupid!!!<br />7) 3 man EOD team conducting raids never this is done at the Platoon level at least.<br />8) Elements walking down the street not pulling security.<br />9) EOD doing the work of tradtional Infantry Platoons in sector bogus.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Use this app on my Fire 8.9&#34;. Really great. Incredible choice of radio stations from everywhere. Clarity is remarkable. Allows for placing stations in favorites for quick recall.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|as some of the other reviews have indicated, this fit on this case is a loose.  It's not so loose that it falls off, but if it was snug, this would be a great value.
1400052173|4.0|This was a fascinating read for anyone interested in medical history. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her famous HeLa cells needed to be told. Skloot told a complicated story in a non-linear structure beautifully. However, I have some mixed feelings about the book. A big premise of the story is that people have taken advantage of the Lacks family, and Skloot goes to great pains to prove to them that she's not like everyone else who has contacted them about HeLa. She does act with integrity and credibility, yet there is something in the writing that also feels exploitive to me. The bottom line is, I wouldn't want my family portrayed like this. That is my only hesitation about the book, but it is definitely worth reading.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|All along, I felt that something was missing in this book. It is a good read, and full of emotions as it is the tradition of Follet, but it feels as if it was written in a rush to meet a deadline, or something like that. We would have needed the double of pages at least to explore all the details Follet would have liked to follow (and us as readers do need!)<br /><br />Fall of Giants was far better in these aspects, maybe the war was shorter, or simpler, or the book was longer :-)<br /><br />Hope everything will get to be perfect on the third book, during the cold war!
B003HARV4S|4.0|Very entertaining. Had that feel of watching a show in Vegas where you know there are tricks behind the scenes but it takes some help to discover them. It immerses you on the plot, making it very entertaining.
B008MM9630|5.0|many touch screen games don't seem to work well on my Kindle.  this game is pretty easy to use so far.  I like the Quests which make fun to build your farm.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I read this series of books as my daughter was talking about it.  I was completely taken with it from the very beginning!  Best series I have read for a long time!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A maddening. addictive game once you start playing you don't want to stop. Well worth having.<br />like most Playrux game it is very well done and a joy to play.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If I could give this book 6, 7, or even 10 stars I would. It's been a long time since a book has kept me awake long past my bedtime because I could not put it down. I LOVED it!!!!!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|If you liked the first one, you'll like this one. It is like a really cool puzzle which is being solved as the movie goes through.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Cute, predictable, and single minded in its message. Definitely captures the essence and colors of Inida. Excellent cast, but a fairly forgettable movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|loved it great book hard to put down great details loved it please take the time to read it you won't regret it
B0041KVXLK|1.0|My copy of SGT Pepper had similar quality problems as described in other reviews -- horrible surface noise, one channel cutting on/off, spindle hole off center so doesn't spin properly.  I returned it -- the second copy better but not great.<br /><br />Also had similar issues with the White Album.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved this game.  It was very spooky and had great graphics.  The story was really different.  Did not have any bug problems.  Ran very smooth.  This game was very worth the money.  Alawar is definitely a great maker of games for androids etc. And again, as I have stated in my other reviews, I really like paying up front for a full game and not having hidden costs.  No hidden costs in this one.  Keep it up Alawar Ent.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Love Don's new apartment.  Excellent writing and character development. Seasons is dense with a lot going on.  Blu Ray quality is excellent.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|First two were ok; good story matching some of the gameplay. Third movie was somewhat out-of-place; somehow movie producers have completely forgotten that Trilogies are priceless, anything else is just noise. This movie is feels like some afterthought and just an excuse to throw out some cool 3D effects.<br /><br />If you like RE then you'll probably watch this (even if you don't like it much), but otherwise I will advise against it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead fan, it is great to be able to catch up on Season 3 before next new episode airs.
0131480057|5.0|Ok, so probably the definitive guide is google.com but this is a close second. Not only does this book do a great job covering all the major distributions, it also provides actionable steps for admins in most realms of operational support.<br /><br />This is one of my top 4 administrator books (and I have read far too many books on the subject).<br /><br />Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook<br />[[ASIN:0975568612 The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps]]<br />[[ASIN:0596007833 Time Management for System Administrators]]<br />[[ASIN:B004JLMUJ0 The Practice of System and Network Administration (2nd Edition)]]<br /><br />All of the information in these books are essential to someone who wants to do a good job managing or providing IT operations.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Very, Very good. My whole family loved it. It is nice to see a movie where the good guys triumph over the bad guys. Good ending too!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Not as good as angry birds, but really fun. A good idea. More for people that like to build things
B00051E906|2.0|We have had problems in the past with Radon in our home. I had a radon mitigation system (a negative pressure exhaust system) installed but I wanted to keep an eye on the radon values in my home. I purchased this detector to help monitor for real-time Radon levels in my home.<br />Unfortunately, I have found it monitors ambient radiation and not specifically Radon gases.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to monitor Radon gases you may want to look at a product specifically for Radon in homes.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Interesting take on vampires and Lincoln. Good movie. I would recommend this movie. I plan on watching it again, soon.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|This Blu-Ray is a MUST-HAVE for any serious Neil fan. Not necessarily for the music that is on the regular album, but for what is on the B-R that is not on the album. But first things first.<br /><br />The graphics that go along with the songs are mostly interesting, in a Bernard Shakey kind of way. Some have old black and white movies going along with the song, while the impressive Driftin' Back has mostly kalidoscope type visuals. They move well with the music, and make a great backdrop as the 27 minute song plays along. There is also a second alternate take of the song Psychedelic Pill included, which is ok, but nothing groundbreaking, just a different mix.<br /><br />The REAL bonus is the 37 minute long 'Horse Back', which IMHO, may be the finest thing Neil and The Horse have ever recorded. This is truly one for the fans, with a 20+ minute intro, leading into a slow and deliberate Pocahontas. This version gives the song so much feeling and emotion. But don't be fooled, the thing also rocks. Neil's guitar playing is some of his finest, and the rest of the band happily travels along on the ride. Then, there's the video. The camera slowly pans around Neil's studio, highlighting the mixing boards, drums, guitars, hand-written lyric sheets, etc. (There in no one in the studio, just a running tape machine).<br /><br />Well worth the money, my only complaint is that Horse Back is only on Blu-ray, so it's really not portable. But that's Neil for ya.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I laughed out loud!! I also, despite the additional fiction, learned some history and geography.  Well written. The characters were memorable.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is your basic solitaire game. I play when I am totally board, but only for a short period of time.
B001EYU1VO|5.0|So, I think that this thing is amazing! I bought this for my Fiancee for Valentines Day earlier this year, and he still adores it and uses it weekly. It's durable for his rage moments and everything. :)
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I have been itching to get my hands on this baby for a long time now. When I finally gave in and bought it I quickly became very discouraged.<br /><br />Many things about this Mic are wonderful. As everyone says, the +20dB setting works wonders in nearly every situation. I was able to pick up whispers from 20 feet away in a quiet room. However, my issues are with the hum that i pick up. I film on a Canon T4i. it's practically brand new from Canon and works flawlessly. The obvious downside though of filming on DSLRs is the awful noise picked up when auto focusing. Easy fix: Don't auto focus. Learn the math associated with focal lengths. it's worth it.<br /><br />Regardless of this, I still pick up a lot of humming when I film at 0dB or +20dB.<br /><br />I'm able to somewhat solve this by setting the bypass to high and toying with it in post production, but for $230 I shouldn't have to.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds came out as a surprise to me but bought it when I first seen it.  The game play is mostly like most of the other Angry Birds games but each bird has their own new powers and resembles someone from the movies. It has the music and the sound effects and added parts to what the Angry Birds in space added to the game.
0061537934|5.0|An incredibly down-to-earth yet sensitive and delightful book about relationships - people in our lives and pets who share them as well.  Enjoyed the book tremendously!
B00338QENI|5.0|Well researched book on a fascinating cell, an amazing women and her descendants. Appeals to history buff, science buff and provokes a dialogue on medical research things, the greater good and personal rights.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I lost interest in this game in a short time. Deleted the app from my kindle after a couple of weeks.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm in the mid-80's and my vision is fading.  I don't like to miss any of Grisham's books because all of his stories are different and well described, especially personal feelings of each character.  The Racketeer is exciting and I'd love to read more, but it takes time to read.  I look forward to the few minutes each day I sit and read, and will finish the book no matter how long it takes.  Richard
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|I would have ranked it negatively if that were an option.<br /><br />This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I figured with the cast and the promotion that was behind it in the movies that the story would at least be strong.<br /><br />Definitely not the case.  I rank this in the top 10 of the most horrible over-hyped movies.  I wish I could get back the 2+ hours of my life that I wasted on this movie.
0545265355|5.0|I have read this trilogy on my Kindle and thought that it would be a great gift for Toys for Tots for a teenager... I hope that they enjoy it as much as I did.
015603283X|4.0|Solid read - plot, characters, style, et al; worth the time even if you haven't seen the movie.  Good enough for me to pass on my copy, with personal recommendation, to a close friend.
B00913P6G0|5.0|As a hip-hop junkie I knew about Kendrick's 2012 debut for some time.  The hype around big releases like this usually means that I am mildly disappointed with the final product.  Good Kid: M.A.A.D City was no such case.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album from start to finish.  The minimal number of guest spots allowed Kendrick's outstanding ability to shine through, especially on my two favorite tracks, &#34;good kid&#34; and &#34;mAAd city&#34;.  If you haven't copped this yet I recommend doing so very soon.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Surprised by Amazon stepping up to the plate to send a new cable under warranty after the covering fell off the original. Great customer service.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I actually saw this in theaters when it was going around and had gotten a free ticket for it. The evil queen and the huntsman were great in their scenes and the movie could have been really great had the lead actress actually acted.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure Kristen Stewart can breath with her mouth closed and act at the same time if she tried a little harder, but I wouldn't want her to hurt herself. Stewart's idea of acting is apparently rapid blinking, breathing through her mouth, and looking wooden during her scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie suffered for it, which is a real shame because the rest of the film is visually stunning. Especially the parts with the evil queen.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|. I had purchased EVERY SINGLE brand and style of pacifier.  My daughter refused them all except the soothies. The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry. I washed our monkey this way.<br />3. Washing machine : put in garment bag and wash.  Let air dry. Do not put in dryer.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought the game because my grandson is a Star Wars fan.  He loved it and would reccomend this game to any Angry Birds game lover.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great series, wonderful acting.<br />You need the earlier seasons to catch up if you haven't watched from the beginning.  Many many twists and turns.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|This is a great album! It has a phenomenal collection of Motown hits, performed as close as possible to the original style. On some tracks it even includes some of the original musicians.  The production is incredible.  Phil did a really great job at capturing the energy and feel of these great songs. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is a Phil Collins or Motown fan.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Can you tell I loved it?  The idea of a 100-year-old man climbing out the window of his old-age home and taking off cross country is just wonderful.  It occurred to me that this is a Forrest Gump kind of book, but the protagonist is quite intelligent.  I liked it so much, I might just read it again, as I read it too fast the first time, just to see what happened.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great movie, fun for the whole family! I ordered this movie for my small children to get more excited about &#34;christmas magic&#34;
B0076DELIG|5.0|There's a reason top flight authors are rare -- it takes a combination of intelligence, wordcraft, wit, soul, heart, vision, experience, & endurance, a combination that is in itself rare: Michael Connelly has it all, & The Black Box is a good example.<br /><br />I've read Connelly since his first Bosch story, The Black Echo (1992), & while his writing has matured along w/his character, he had these same qualities in the beginning, used them all in the interim, & hasn't forsaken them now.<br /><br />A compelling, heart-engaging mystery as Bosch works to clear a 1992 Rodney King Riots murder in spite of the complications of time, departmental roadblocks, a destructive relationship w/his immediate superior, & the (welcome & positive) entanglements of his personal relationships w/his partner, daughter, & girlfriend. The ending is a signature of successful mystery: you don't see the resolution until it is upon you, but once you do, you can look back & tell yourself, \\"I should have seen that coming!\\"<br /><br />IMHO, 2 of Bosch's best recurring characters are music (jazz/blues) & setting (mostly greater Los Angeles, but in this story, CA's central valley, too). I always list the music Bosch listens to & usually add them to my own listening collection. This time out, it's the soulful & captivating Art Pepper. BTW, Bosch's daughter birthday gifts him w/6 CDs from Pepper's \\"Unreleased Art,\\" but I see from my Amazon search that there is now a 7th CD. I've been to some of the locations in this book, & often wonder if I had been there the same time as Connelly or Bosch, the descriptions are so vivid & authentic. And his restaurant descriptions are usually completely trustworthy. This time out, I'm going to try Bird's on Franklin, especially the frickles (fried pickles).<br /><br />Another reviewer dismissed the presence of Bosch's teenage daughter Maddie in this story, but I strongly disagree. The mirror dance between young Bosch/old Bosch & his daughter is enlightening & engaging. There's a redemptive circle from young Bosch just traumatized from Viet Nam through mid-Bosch just beginning to live again to current-Bosch living for & enhancing his daughter's life. Once again, Connelly produces a believable character arc in a man who began this series in 1992 a hair from lonely suicide & quite believably in this installment emerges from the final death scene and pulls \\"out his phone so he could call home.\\"<br /><br />The problem w/top flight authors is that their readers must wait between new books. It's worth it.
B005FISBTO|2.0|I came here specifically to leave a review warning about the Showtime ads on the DVD set, but it looks like other reviewers have that covered.<br /><br />I will say that this was the season that 'Dexter' officially jumped the shark.  There are some glimmers of interesting character dynamics, and even an unexpected twist, but overall the plot is overwrought, the acting is hamfisted (everyone has this 'here we go again' tone to their delivery) and the whole show have become tired and predictable.  Yeah, we get it, LaGuerta is evil, Deb is nosey, Joey is a drunk, Batista is a goody-good, etc.  We've seen this stuff played out over and over.  Why are we watching a makeout session between two new characters, and even then, its just an intern and a babysitter?  Fluff stuff.  I'd prefer my 'Dexter' in 90 minute doses a la 'Sherlock'.  The show hit a lull through seasons 2-4, then season 5 got interesting again, now we're back to Dexter being a neglectful father and up to his old hijinks again.  Time to give it a rest...
B003O86FMW|3.0|Interesting in context but did not hold my attention.......Will not read the next one, like James Patterson better...great for high school kids though
B0060AY85C|5.0|This book is elegant in its story as Ms Morrisons takes us on this journey Home.  We are allowed to view racism though the eyes of our hero and compare notes we have learn  as opposed to the story  being told.<br /><br />In Home we learn of private wars fought in the souls of men, we are again remained of the kindness of strangers who also have a story to tell. It is a story of sibling love and obligation.  The women of Home, have their own magic and healing strength.<br /><br />Alas , the book is too short and ends abruptly.  One is left hungry for more...<br /><br />Qwriter
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game.......could have your own attack controls. that would've put it over the top. but still a great game with lots of play time
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I have been annoying everyone with this movie, so it's about time I shared on Amazon.<br />This movie is perfect. End of story.<br />Let's start with casting : in spite of many people apprehension, Kristen Steward is wonderful. She does and expresses so much with so little. Charlize Theron throws her whole heart into the pain and cruelty of the character. Chris Hemsworth is gorgeous and brooding (his accent is stuck on demo but you get used to it), the eight dwarves are the icing on the cake (much, much more than just a comic relief).<br />Next photography : Beautiful, just beautiful. The darkness is threatening, the light is enlighting, the colours teach the rainbow a thing or two.<br />The music : soaring and enchanting, all the way to the end credits with Florence and the Machine.<br />The directing : the action sequences are thrilling, fast and don't pull punches, the fairytale sequences want to make you believe.<br />As far as the narrative goes... I could go on for a while (don't hesitate to contact me to discuss)... but let's note that the &#34;love story&#34; is underplayed (and hence a lot sexier) than the overt Prince Charming (quite lovely and convincing too). The character with the most lines is actually the bad guy.<br />In short (too late), please watch and lemme know.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's novels and enjoyed every one.  This is not her best, but well worth your time to read.

B0091LS07E|4.0|While Alicia Keys has been around for over 10 years, Girl on Fire is the first of her albums that I have bought or listened to.  So, I guess I've been missing the boat if this is representative of her previous work - which I intend to check out soon, btw.  She has a great combination of vocal, piano, and songwriting talent.  I do find it curious that \\"Girl On Fire\\" is the first single; however, I think it is far from the strongest track on the album.  I like everything but \\"Fire We Make\\" (sorry, I didn't care for Maxwell's vocals) better than \\"Girl On Fire\\".  My favorites are \\"That's When I Knew\\", \\"Brand New Me\\", and \\"When It's All Over\\" the last of which ends with a playful dialog toddler son.  I thought this gave her already personal lyrics and even more personal touch.  All three of those songs have vocals that are very expressive and earnest, and I connected with them the most.  The rest of the songs are also good (with the exceptions noted above).  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong vocals and piano with R&B backing.<br /><br />Download this:  When It's All Over

B007UXSPK2|2.0|There's always been a certain amount of cheese in the MI films, but the progression from the original to MI:3 had tempered that a little bit and gradually brought a harder edge to the stories. Now we have Ghost Protocol which feels like a complete turnaround, taking us back to MI territory (and beyond) with sloppy writing, a kind of silly and incomplete story, and cheese cheese cheese. Even the action sequences seem to not take themselves seriously.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that this is bad in general and plenty of movies relish in this stuff, but Ghost Protocol just doesn't seem to pull it off. Part of the problem here could be my expectations from MI:3 which went to some dark territory, but GP does have problems that are entirely it's own. The plot is paper thin and doesn't make a lot of sense even in the moment, and once again we're back to a tired plot line about agents being disavowed and having to work on their own to clear their names. Didn't we cover this ground in the first movie? Yes, this time it's on a larger scale, but that doesn't make it better.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought it would be a boring story, but it turned out to be a very different and unexpected story.  It is particularly heartwarming for anybody who has ever worked with or has a child who had a difficult upbringing.  All social workers should read this one!
B002VWNICC|5.0|Wonderful recreation of an era... and than it gets shot, boozed up and beat to an inch of its life. Great casting, great music, convoluted storyline (it took me a few viewing before I got it) but well worth your time.
0763644765|5.0|The first time my son read this he went right into the bathroom and demanded a turn to sit on the potty. I hadn't done any potty training, and he didn't actually &#34;go.&#34; But he sat his bare bum on the toilet (stool and insert assisted) without much hesitation. He cried when I insisted he put a diaper back on (after 15 mins of climbing up and down from the potty).<br /><br />He is starting to request this as a nighttime read. We dont' plan on potty training for another 2 months, (my son is only 25 months now) but this seems to be working really well as a pre-potty training tool.

6304711905|5.0|This is a GREAT movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Western movies!
B003O86FMW|4.0|First book was great.  Second was good except there really wasn't an ending.  Sort of like how a soap opera leaves you hanging.  I feel every reader deserves an ending to a book.  It's the author's responsibility to find a creative way to revisit the story in futures books.  Aside from that, the third book was great.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Good Movie, second time i watched it.  A different side of young Lincoln.  May purchase the movie after all.  A little bloody, but okay
B002APU580|5.0|I definite winner....every woman wants a Mr Darcy in their lives. I have watched it many times. I love it.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times I have lost count.  Each time of viewing it, I discovered something new I had not seen before. Such a warm hearted movie! I enjoyed watching this film sooooooo much more than the other productions carrying the same title.  This one is definitely the VERY BEST!
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I am an avid reader but this one has me at a loss.  Every chapter switches between past and present episodes of her OCD...and it is rather difficult to follow sometimes.  I've read better, but I've read worse.

B008NW67E0|5.0|If you are a fan of Mumford & Sons you may just find this to be their best album. Always great to see that rarity of bands gaining creative momentum.
B005STGJHQ|3.0|But not rthe best Foo recording. Quality is lacking in this recording, may watch for this specific studio, before ordering again.
B009AP2G26|5.0|The new season is great.  It is sad to see some of the original cast go.  Some of the new characters are hit or miss.  But the stories are still awesome, the songs featured are fantastic and if you are a fan, you will still love this season for all of it's ups and downs.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I absolutely love every song. Surprisingly, \\"Girl On Fire\\" is the weakest song on the CD, even though it's the title track...still a good song though. She was going to name it after \\"Brand New Me\\" which I think this CD would have fit better with that song. But nonetheless, it really is a great CD. No need to skip through, you listen all the way through! A classic love album. I recommend it to anyone who truly loves and appreciates good music. If you're already a fan of hers, then you'll definitely love it!
B00003CXWV|4.0|Johnny Depp is excellent playing dope-dealer George Jung who despite making millions of dollars ended up penniless and in a Federal prison until 2015, plus was abandoned by his wife and daughter. While the script doesn't portray George as a hero it constantly distorts the truth. For example, early in the film, after George is busted in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana, he skips bail supposedly to be with his then girlfriend who allegedly was dying of cancer according to the film. Complete hogwash: she is still alive and was interviewed by the book author of Blow. Moreover, George was never \\"faithful\\" nor monogamous: he was continually \\"shacking up\\" with any girl who wanted to get high.<br /><br />I give Johnny Depp credit for taking such a role because it isn't easy playing a loser without any redeemable traits. The best parts of the story are: Panama's Manny Noriega screwing George out of $30 million; George set-up by his long-time friends who previously had been arrested by the Drug Enforcement Agency; and, George in prison imagining his daughter will visit, which is reason alone to watch this movie. The sad thing is that for every George in prison there are one hundred more repeating his life.
1610660242|5.0|Great book, great company.<br />OK, I cannot say if all things in there are true or not, but it gives quite a few ideas about things you can implement in your company and personal life.<br />Makes you wonder about all the wrong things that go on in your company<br />A quick and fun read.
B000002A46|5.0|On the strength of arguably the most played Holiday song of the decade on the radio, the superb \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\", and her stunning version of \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\", I decided it was time to add this hit CD to my collection. Classic stuff from the incredible Mariah. I was actually surprised in some regards. True to her Gospel influences, some moments, especially the last track, sound as though they could have been recorded on Sunday morning in the choir loft. Rejoice in the season!  A cool surprise is her medley of the traditional \\"Joy To The World\\" carol with the Three Dog Night smash \\"Joy To The World\\" (written by Hoyt Axton). Ecclectic...and special. Oddly, I never made the connection of these same-titled songs together. Kudos for a unique idea! My goodness, this lady can sing. I rate this a must-have contemporary classic album. One of the best Christmas CD's of the last quarter century, and in the top few of the '90's. I only wish it had even more songs...It ends too soon.  Sound quality?  Crystal clear...smooth as new-fallen snow. Brave, bold, refreshingly different. 5 stars , and 5 jingle bells, all the way!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|We recently took a 3k mile road trip and used my gopro to take a time lapse of the 6 day drive. The mount keeps all the ports and memory card accessible while still protecting the camera and lens. Definately a must have for a gopro hero 2 kit.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is a book for one of the most secret operation in recent years conducted by the USA. So the book has many gaps due to security reasons, but it gives a good sense of how SEAL operations are conducted.  Also, there are some interesting details about SEALs and what kind of men they are, how they operate and how they feel.  Of course there is the whole American bravado, but it is expected in such a book. All in all it is an interesting and fast read, and the anticipation to get the killing of bin Landen makes you read it faster.<br />One final note. Maybe the author (not his real name) should not have mentioned that a fellow soldier was sitting on bin Landen's body on the helicopter. It is not a detail that people are interested in, and I am sure it pissed off a lot of people.<br />But as this book had the go ahead of many departments, I am sure they left it on purpose, an equally stupid move
0547884591|5.0|Tim's new books is really a milestone and a must-read! Getting his perspective on how to learn any skill, step-by-step, is simply amazing... Becoming better at cooking is simply ONE example. The true power of this book is in Tim's simple formula for learning anything. That alone is worth 100X the cost of this book. Get it now!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a really good book especially because the reading level is at about a 5.6 so it is targeted for older kids. It is just like any other simply kid book funny and entertaining. Any kid will love it!
0307744434|2.0|I thought i would try something different and it looked like Night Circus was going to be it.  For about the 1st 30% I was intrigued but, after that it went downhill for me.  The main characters stayed on the page and never came alive .  I do not want to ruin anything but I will say this goes way way past the point of reality and is repetitive and mundane.  Iread about 60 % of the book and then said it was enough , I fell asleep within 2 pages, I think I was bored.  I pushed the DELETE button.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This book is about the life journey of Jun Do, an almost-orphan from North Korea under the reign of Kim Jong Il. After his mother was kidnapped, Jun Do was raised by his father, an orphanage supervisor (who treated his son like he was an just another orphan). Johnson does a stellar job of setting the scene of life in North Korea - the fear, uncertainty, and sameness of daily life - and yet he manages to insert a bit of humor and sarcasm into Jun Do's story. We see Jun Do grow from a young teenager working in the mines to a young man working for a human trafficking organization to a radio control specialist on a cargo ship. In his youth, Jun Do's one wish is that he will be reunited with his mother. The reader is led to believe that the story will take us along his journey to find her, but this premise is quickly (and abruptly) dropped, which contributed to my 3-star rating.  I really appreciated the beginning of this novel, with the introduction to Jun Do and the other characters and the attention to detail in describing the torment of life in North Korea. And I also liked the end of of novel because Johnson managed to build a lot of suspense leading up to it, but the middle of this book fell flat for me; the story began to drag and become repetitive. One thing stuck with me though: with each new job Jun Do takes on, he believes there will be some reward for his efforts. Sadly, his labors never bring the opportunities he hopes for. In one scene, he is reviewing a stack of American DVDs. Johnson writes, \\"He studied the pictures on their covers and read their descriptions, but where was the film that had no beginning, an unrelenting middle, and ended over and over?\\" This line perfectly sums up Jun Do's sad life and this novel. It's worth a look to learn about life in North Korea in a fictionalized account, but this book was take-it-or-leave-it for me.<br /><br />PS - A potential reader may take into account that there are some graphic torture scenes in this novel.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This was a phenomenally good movie.  It is simultaneously a very faithful adaptation of the source material and yet grounded in a modern-day realism (astute observers will recall that the graphic novel was, shall we say, garishly 80's at times).  To be honest, I can't really tell how they pulled that off or what makes me think so.  The animation and voice acting are both superb.<br /><br />Whereas some of the older DC animated movies (i.e. 'First Flight', 'Wonder Woman') felt kind of like long-form entries in the Timmverse (which isn't remotely a bad thing), this truly feels like a distinct, masterful work of art.<br /><br />I can't wait to sit down one Saturday and watch 'Year One', 'Under the Red Hood', 'Dark Knight Returns, Part 1' and 'Dark Knight Returns, Part 2' in one long, glorious, Batman-filled afternoon.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One thing for sure, there probably isn't a story line already done or a story line that could be better in anyone's eye.<br /><br />That being said, this really is a fabulous movie!!! Don't get hung up on the fact the the main characters are being played by older actors, because they are great actors and really bring emotion to the forefront. Don't get hung up on the fact that there is a lot going on in the movie - it is not overwhelming and makes sense. Don't get hung up on the how things happen in the movie - it isn't real life and by the way, strange & predictable things happen in reality as well!<br /><br />What you need to do is sit back and enjoy it! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, & at some level anyone of us can identify with it at some point. Enjoy the scenery, the colors, the wit. It is worth it!<br /><br />Besides, what in the world is wrong with a movie with older actors in it any way?!! Like death & taxes, becoming older is guaranteed!

B005OT2YVA|5.0|In case you missed it, the quality isn't quite what I had hoped... Its definitely only standard definition, if that.  I realize it wasn't advertised as HD but I don't think this quite DVD quality which at the very least is what I was hoping to get.  I would also like it if it wasn't encrypted so only the little Amazon video player can play it!  I bought the movie, let me watch it where I want!<br /><br />Edit:  So my previous assessment was wrong... the problem was that Amazon didn't think my computer could play the HD so it was sending me the SD version when I would stream or download it.  That was bad considering a was watching it via HDMI on my big HD tv.  It looked TERRIBLE.  So I got on my xbox and downloaded the free Prime Video app which allowed me to watch that through my xbox on the same TV and this time I got the HD version.  It was beautiful.<br />I do still wish I could get a better quality for my computer but since I can get the HD I have raised my rating to 5 stars.  For $10 its good.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the book! I thought the characters were well developed. Felt like I knew them ,but there was still a mystery about them. Just when you felt like you had everything fingered out,then their was a twist that you didn't see coming.Have read other Kate Morton books,but at the end of the &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; ,I was in awe of her story telling abilities.Very well done,very entertaining.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|Product worked as advertised. Now I can connect a USB flash drive or my android phone directly to the MMI in my car.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. I can look for any topic and I will find something interesting.l have found a lot of cool ideas.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great Love story... A realistic look into some pleasure and pain most people don't dare to induldge in.  Very easy to read and a page turner for sure.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Title says it all, hands down the best calender app out there. I've tried others and was very disappointed, used daily.
B008G59IKO|1.0|I am an avid fan of Green Day. I read the reviews and as suggested, I listened to \\"Foxboro Hot Tubs\\", a side project of Green Day before listening to DOS!. I purchased both from Amazon at the same time. Supposedly DOS! is supposed to be similar to that. I think FOXBORO is faaaar better than DOS! I couldn't listen to DOS! it was just noise to me. Why didn't Green Day release FOXBORO under their own name? It is different than most recent releases, but it rocks just the same. It's like late 60s early 70s pop-sounding but I love it! I probably will not buy TRE!<br /><br />Disappointing.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|There are not a whole lot of apps that I'll give a 5 star rating to.  This however is one of the.  If I've had installed for a few moths that must mean its good.  This I've had for that time frame plus.  It was free, it doesn't freeze up like other apps have so this gets my 5 Star Approval.
B00A77II0U|1.0|Usually love Alawar games, but this one keeps crashing and restarting. Also, keeps saying wrong when I know I'm clicking the right thing. Waste of $2.99...
0425263916|3.0|This was a good book don't get me wrong. I will probably read all of them but it was a little too wierd for me.
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is kinky romantic. Ana and Christian take the reader on a rollercoaster ride fifty shades up.<br />It is an intriguing novel escalating readers expecations and charlatan ideas of two lovers entwined in fear, sadism, and lust.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Love her, her music, her being herself without barriers. The limited edition is outstanding with precious details in addition. Enjoy!
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|Some great motor city style music.  Hawthorne has the voice to carry this off, comparable to Robin Thick and that's meant to be a compliment.  All the music is original be sure to listen to &#34;The Walk&#34; and &#34;A Long Time&#34;, though pretty much everything is good on this album.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|Its nothing special but nothing a person can complain about when its free.  I've had ones that have forced closed before and this one doesn't do it.  I had installed for a short while only.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|When I learned that Sigur Rós were hearkening back to their older albums for sound, I was ecstatic. My favorite of Sigur Rós's albums continues to be '[[ASIN:B003YM32GA Agaetis Byrjun]]' and '[[ASIN:B00006LLNU Sigur Rós]].' Those two albums introduced me to a completely different realm within music that I thought wasn't possible with today's obsession with pop media. Since then I have sought out many different forms of ambient and soaring soundscapes. So I don't have to really explain in great detail how those previous albums shaped my future music tastes. This is all not to say that their follow-up albums were not any good--I consider them great achievements of style, in fact. However, those albums did not have the same kind of ambient nature and experimental tendencies. This album, though, was meant to finally bridge that gap.<br /><br />'Valtari' is, of course, more of an ambient album. Much like many other reviewers, I was not really immediately impressed with the album as a whole. It was beautiful, indeed, but I didn't find it particularly amazing. It took me a few listens to really grasp the whole of the album. Again, many other reviewers have mentioned 'Varúð' as the pivotal moment of the album. I agree with this and hold it as my favorite track of the album. But this does not mean any listener should disregard the rest of the record. Listen to it, take in the sounds, and do all of that cliché stuff, because the fact is that this album is meant for complete digestion. As background music or as the main point of attention, these songs have a place for any time. And if you were waiting for the ambient record they promised then definitely listen. It is beautiful.
0345803485|4.0|To begin, this review should be 7 of 10, 4 of 5 does not do it justice. Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\" is a true American Classic touching on one of the most profound, sensitive, and integral parts of the American identity. FIfty Shades of Grey does on better. The book is rife with caustic social criticism, pertinent observations, and a lot of heart. Similar titles would have to include Heart of Darkness, Blood Meridian, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, as well as the timeless classic The Man also Rises. Why then, why, has it not received all 5 stars? The answer, simple. E.L. James has deprived the world of some of the greatest art since Bach, Michelangelo, and Dante roamed the earth. The only improvement this book could have, and indeed the only reason this review is necessary is to say, this is a work of genius, not yet fully realized.
B008J05EL8|1.0|software problem<br />I cant get it to show up on office suite software.  UGH!!!!!!<br />help if u can please.  Mary
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book will start out slow, but thats just the beginning. When you start this book don't stop reading at the beginning....keep going....You wont believe what happens at the end.<br />  This is a book that leaves you wanting more.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|If you haven't heard Blues legend Buddy Guy this is the album for you.  Buddy has a lot of friends on this album, Carlos Santana, John Mayer, Tracy Chapman, Keith Richards and does a great variety of classic's.  Be sure to catch the Santana assisted &#34;I Put a Spell On You&#34; or the Keith Richards assisted &#34;The Price You Got to Pay&#34; and the classic &#34;Ninety Nine and One Half&#34;.  In my opinion this is the best Buddy Guy album of them all and that's saying a lot.  Buddy Guy has been listed as one of the top 25 guitarist's in the world and this album just adds to his resume.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|If you read a synopsis of Pitch Perfect, it just sounds like your typical rom-com, coming-of-age, singing movie; but I swear to you it's not. After being forced to see it by my stepbrother and his girlfriend, I was very, very pleasantly surprised. Pitch Perfect is probably one of my favorite movies ever now. As soon as the credits started rolling I knew I was in love and I needed to see it again. So I did, a week later. The music was aca-mazing! The soundtrack is absolutely off the charts! I am obsessed! My favorite song from it is the Bellas finals. The plot was a bit cliché, but good. The acting wasn't fantastic, but the goal here clearly wasn't to try and get nominated for an Oscar. They just wanted us to like the movie, and I more than liked it, so they succeeded.<br /><br />Anna Kendrick played Beca, an amateur DJ who wants nothing more than to leave college and move to Los Angeles, causing her to be miserable all the time and shutting out everyone who cares about her. Her main love interest Jesse, played by Skylar Astin (Ugh, I just melted when I said his name), is everything a charming college boy should be. Plus, he can sing. He tries to bond with Beca and sweep her off her feet, but she just shuts him out. This causes Jesse's heart to break and every girl in America to get tears in their eyes. Needless to say, I fell in love with him. Brittany Snow and Anna Camp were hilarious as the Bella's head voices; and Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins were scene-stealers playing the commentators for the competitions. But, no one (not even Skylar) stole the show like Rebel Wilson did as Fat Amy. I won't say anything else. Go see Pitch Perfect!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Put in on my Fire for my grand daughter and she really enjoyed playing it.  She found it to be a little bit harder the the Rio game that I down loaded first.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|althought this game started out good, it now freezes constantly, and it just took away about 40 dollars i had. I bought those dollars with real money and I don't know how to get it back. im ready to junk this game!!

B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought it was interesting but the characters weren't as detailed as JK Rowling's characters from the Harry Potter books. It left me unsatisfied.

B00448SE4S|4.0|I like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. I like the video game aspect of the movie. It makes it more fun to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Book was exceptional. Very Exciting.  The movie  captures the book . The movie is driven by Jennifer Lawernce. An actor to be watched,and admired.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having read many books this past year after the death of my parents, I have searched for SOMETHING to hold onto and believe about an afterlife. This book has changed my life. It has offered me peace and an understanding of truly being reunited with my parents one day soon. This book will change your life!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like these games on a big platform not a small screen. Good twists to game in Star Wars universe
B008ULM7HU|5.0|I ordered this collection and am in love with it! A truly fun set of their biggest and best hits; it is sure to please any Duranie! After 30+ years, this band keeps going and going with as much enthusiasm and drive as ever before, creating multi-generations of fans! This set of hits is a must-have.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, I do prefer to watch with the subtitles though as the american voices just don't match their Korean actors. They needed to at least have asian accents to make the movie feel realistic. This movie is action packed getting into things pretty quickly.

B009MF56GC|1.0|This was one pathetic movie, one stupid thing after another.  This is literally a bunch of aging action stars running around shooting large firearms.  The massive amount of cheesy one lines is insane.  We had to pop it out after an hour, we just could not take anymore.  Seems like at least one of these guys could put out one decent movie.  If this is what we can expect from these guys, then the next generation is going to easily plow over them.  Save your money, do not use any funds you worked for to buy, or watch this, you WILL be ripped off.
B006L0A5P8|2.0|No different than Lastpass. I will not store my account numbers and passwords in the Cloud. 1Password on my iMac is first rate, but the Keepass password manager app is a better and safer choice, in my opinion on my kindle fire. I use Opera Mobile browser with save password option and highly recommend this combination for safety and UI on the kindle fire.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was a late-comer to this show.  Season 2 had already begun when a friend told me to check it out.  The first episode had me hooked and I finished season 1 in under a week (my poor, neglected children).  The characters are all so flawed, yet so sympathetic.  It's just a fabulously well crafted series.  I love how the last five minutes of just about every episode leave me stunned.
0307474259|5.0|This is not a diet, this is a lifestyle change. I've read Good Calories, Bad Calories - which is an amazing but substantial read - and was keen to get the newest work of Mr. Taubes.<br /><br />While the diet restrictions dictated by this book can be debated by many, the science behind them and resulting health benefits speak for themselves.<br /><br />Read it. Force yourself to abide by it for two weeks. Then you decide.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Get this one!  It has so much variety and isn't impossible to do.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you probably have it already.  But it is so much fun, you have to try it.

B002WY65W4|5.0|Let's face it - there are a ton of Zombie movies out there - some great and some REALLY BAD! This, for our family, falls in the GREAT realm. The first time we saw the film we weren't sure what to expect but soon found ourselves laughing out loud and loving the originality of the screenplay. The writing and the special effects and the humor have been seamlessly rolled into one terrific little movie. The &#34;rules&#34; to live by are a riot (and make sense! Who wouldn't practice their &#34;cardio&#34; to outrun a zombie?) and Woody Harrelson's passion rekindles my love for Twinkies. Bill Murray's cameo is terrific. On top of that, when you present this movie in Blu-ray on a big fat HDTV - well, you have a winning combination.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|had to have it in the car for the kids the digital age is great! I love it. going to get more
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'll be interested in seeing where this new storyline to a great franchise goes.  The ancestral humans are very intriguing.
0141337656|3.0|The cover of the book was well worn and there was a library code on the spine.  Not sure if this is a legal item.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Well written and very interesting story. Grabs your attention from start to finish, books like this and writers this good are few.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This movie is entertaining and reminds us to take in consideration of others differences. I think it has a good anti-bullying<br />theme. My 7 year old and 12 year old really like it and watch it over and over again.
B0061QD82E|5.0|One of my all time favorite Disney movies.  Blu-ray is an added benefit for the sound and picture quality.  This copy came with blu-ray + DVD.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Took my daughters to see this movie when it came out in theaters.  They loved it so much, they asked to see it again and again.  This is a great movie to be enjoyed by the whole family.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was curious how this writer of the great Harry Potter series was going to make this transition to adult fiction. I was less than impressed. It didn't move along as well as I might have desired. The characters and their situations, which were many, had been given too much description. You had to wade through this novel.
B009S8PEHY|2.0|I got a PHENOMENAL deal on this from Amazon MP3 Downloads so I didn't mind taking a chance.<br /><br />I love Rod, but I'm not feeling his versions at all.  Now, had he sung them in the traditional way, I'd have given it at least 4 stars.<br /><br />I can't complain about the price cause the download was a bargain compared to *Tunes.  I'm satisfied with my purchase price, just not the music.  For me it was a one-and-done.  I actually couldn't get through even half of the CD.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it.
B005OP7162|5.0|I love love love this show!  I wondered how it would continue after certain things were discovered and relationships ended, but they keep finding ways to keep it interesting!
B003KRJNBW|3.0|The Book of Eli had interesting plot and surprising ending but was not one of Denzel's better movies.  There was some lack of character development for several roles, including Eli.  More of an action film with spiritual side not totally explored however, it is worth viewing.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I just bought this for $3.99 on a whim and it has really gotten in my head. I love if not like most of the songs. Can't get Radioactive out of my head. Has almost a hypontic feel to it. Try out if you like indie rock.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|This isn't your average cartel movie! It starts off fast, and covers a lot of ground. The plot is fairly simple. Guys cross cartel, guys get in trouble, guys attack cartel... Fun film over-all.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use Dropbox on all my devices - and my kids have it on their laptops, too. We can share pictures and school documents. They often put things in dropbox for me to print for them as well. Excellent tool!
B009YU62H2|3.0|The good news is this CD sounds like the same old Soundgarden from 16 years ago, since their last CD. The bad news is, this sounds like the same old Soundgarden from 16 years ago. When SG split back in the 90's, I was seriously disappointed. They were one of those rare bands who got better with every CD they put out.  So I looked fwd to their new effort. After a few spin, it's a mixed bag for me, I love that they still have their signature sound, however music has progressed over the late 16 years (as it always does) and I'd hoped their sound would of progressed also. So it sounds a little dated, and it lacks the depth that I feel they are capable of. I think hardcore SG fans may get something out of it, but it probably won't win over any new fans.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I love this show!  1st I watched it w/ my nieces & friend's kids (they LOVE it btw ;) but then, I've found myself watching it w/o them!  Hahaha!  This show IMO, is different from ALL other kids shows in that the main theme is &#34;leveling&#34; w/ kids rather than trying to tell them that they can b/do something that they can't ;)
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I bought this and the Imagine Dragons album and so far i'm playing both on constant repeat. Fun definitely has that upbeat music that makes you want to move around and shout out with the songs. I really like this group.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I never got the cahnce to attend a LZ concert when they were together although I did see Jimmy and Robert's acoustic gig which was awesome. When I heard they were releasing the 2007 concert I felt I had to have. I watched it after Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family and I must say the sound is probably better than anything they did back in the day. Plant's voice isn't what it used to be but in my eyes he still can deliver the goods. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would reccomend it to all...just hope they decide to do this again and I can get to watch live!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app and recommend it to everyone I know. It helps me stay in a better routine for my Bible studies since I can take it with my anywhere. :)
1451627289|5.0|This was an excellent book!  Mr. King did a great job in researching and using that information to write an excellent book.  I am not a big reader, but I could not put this book down.
B000QCS9NM|4.0|It is a fun ride. I was never sure where we were going till we got there. But the journey was fun.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Wow, this is a return to form after the disappointing Resistance.  There are some new directions being explored especially in Madness and the two part 2nd Law.<br /><br />Overall, a very enjoyable album.  Lets just say it's been on repeat since being received.<br /><br />Brit Rock at it's best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the entire trilogy. It was a thrilling page turner! You keep wondering what will happened next. Extremely entertaining. I recommend for everyone!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Cute game. Has potential to be quite fun down the road as well. 5 stars, more games should be this well designed!
1843106698|4.0|This book is a more technical read about Asperger's Syndrome, but is a must read.  Great descriptions and suggestions from the author.  Parents of children's with Asperger's will appreciate this book.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The only thing that I don't like is the fact that you can not  search a word you have to guess
B000FC130E|4.0|Very engrossing and brilliantly imagined story.<br />I wasn't fond of the protagonist at first and the gore was a bit of a turn off, but overall it was a great reading experience.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follet grabs and holds the readers attention from beginning to end. The characters he created guide the reader through the labrynth of causes and drama the lead to the World War. It is the depth and pathos of the characters' involvement with one another that holds the readers attention and gives depth and texture to the events of that fascinating and tragic time.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Book covers time from 1911 through 1920.Very good coverage of August 1914 diplomatic efforts to avoid WW II, especially those of Germany, which tried to avoid war.  The rise of Bolshevism in Russia is well explained as is trench warfare.  Main characters are Welsh miners, English aristocracy, German aristocracy, and Russian proletariat.  Very engaging novel.  After finishing it on my Kindle, I immediately ordered the second book in the trilogy.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Classic movie,thanks a lot,I had a great time watching it,the best of the Halloween series,thanks again,I'll be buying some more.
0393064476|3.0|While this is an interesting book, especially for an engineer with minimal exposure to this type of subject matter,  I simply cannot believe that it won a Pulitzer.  Last year must have been an off year for non fiction.  Implied on the cover is the statement that the book will describe a story that will explain how the world became modern.  Mr Greenblatt failed to make his case.  An interesting read but scarcely earth shattering.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Awesome movie!!  The characters seem so real even though they are computer generated.  Best one for baby boomers!!  Helps remember your childhood!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I don't like to be frightened but I like a good mystery.  This definitely fit the bill.  I enjoyed the interplay between the two main characters and the wondering if the cat was still the cat and. if not, who was.  Another thing I loved about the movie was all the comedy - &#34;poulet, poulet!!!&#34;  It made for a fun and stimulate movie.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I never believed in an afterlife until my wife of 49 years experienced a premonition just before she died that profoundly affected me.  That, and events that have happened to me since her death now convince me of the existence of an afterlife.<br /><br />As I understand it, Dr. Alexander had a very rare form of meningitus, an 8-day coma where he was effectively brain-dead and yet he experienced a detailed, beautiful and repeating experience of another existence -- an experience that he can't explain as a neurologist since the portions of his brain necessary to have that experience, visual, audiory, reseaoning, were just not available in the coma.  Hence the proof.<br />After a startling full recovery he wrote his experience before reading of similar such events written by others.  The chapters of the book describing what he experienced -- he is an excellent writer, detailed and vibrant, yet he admits to an inabliblity to fully describe what he saw, felt and heard -- are sublimely beautiful and in themselves make the book worthwhile.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|This a great horror/sci-fi movie. Definately one of the best &#34;bug&#34; movies ever made. While the science is sometimes a little off, at least it isn't just whacko. Good acting, lots of action, great special effects for its day. A must see!
B005LAII12|5.0|The title says it all.  Saw it in theaters and had to pre-order.  It is a fowl movie, beware! Try not to laugh to hard....
1616960922|3.0|I love Brandon Sanderson's magical worlds.  He has made some fascinating, interesting, and thoughtful magic.  This book had that kind of magic but the story itself was just not there for me.  It moved too slowly at first so that I put it away for more interesting reading until I had some extra time.  When I got back to the book, it contained unexplained reactions from characters and then just ended without letting the reader know if anything that happened really made a difference.<br /><br />However, if you want to read the book just to see a wizard of an author come up with another type of fascinating magic, then you would probably enjoy it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I wouldn't recommend this book.  I don't understand why it's been a best seller for so long.  The first half of the book was downright boring.  I didn't like any of the characters.  The storyline is predictable and there are some serious flaws with the ending.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I bought \\"Emma\\" for my wife, who is a big Jane Austen fan. However, I enjoyed it as well, when I sat down and watched it with her. If you liked \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Downton Abbey,\\" you'll love Emma!
B007V65R54|5.0|Excellent and easy reading. Funny, insightful and well written. I learned a lot. Really explains why in this past election cycle the pundits, &#34;experts&#34; pollsters were so off base. Regardless of party affiliation this is a must read, but more so for conservatives as the progressives knew what was happening, the conservatives had blinders on and this explains how that happened. This applies to many other things. Its not a political book at all, but does touch on politics and polling as well as gaming theory.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season one was about survival; season two was about relationships. Season three is like those two themes on steroids. Awesome.

B003XF1OJK|5.0|If you're a fan of the Halo franchise and are looking for more back-story than the games provided, then Halo: The Fall of Reach will not disappoint. The focus of the book is on Master Chief and the Spartan-II program (which is the focal point), but The Fall of Reach also provides a glimpse into the many naval and ground battles fought between the UNSC and Covenant in the early years of the conflict. There is plenty of dialogue, a healthy dose of action, and the pacing is excellent. Again, if you're a fan of the franchise do yourself a favor and get this book, it's very entertaining!

B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I did not like it. Lacked excitement. Plot didnt not have a distinct character. The princess character did not impress me either :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|It  will not grab you at the first sentence  or even at the first chapter.  These characters are not in the  least likable. Review after review  had stated  it was a page turner so I stuck with it.  It is a &#34;thriller&#34; in the true sense of the word!  Yes, read this book before they make the movie ( which they will!)  and you will never be as surprised by the movie as when you read this climax and denoument.  I will admit I slammed the book shut at the end....and then when I had the time to truly appreciate what I read-  I give kudos  to the author- for the twists and turns.
0547884591|5.0|This book is great for someone without a lot of experience in the kitchen. It gives good lessons and recipes (of the ones I have tried so far), and the progression of difficulty from easy to more complicated is nice for a new cook. I like the frequent tangents the book goes on, how to catch rock doves(pigeons) comes to mind, and the whole section on learning techniques, so be prepared for those if you were expecting a straight forward cooking manual.<br /><br />This book is much like the other 4 hour books in that it is a great starting point. Will 4 hour chef teach you everything you need to be a great chef...no, but it will certainly get you cooking more impressive dishes quickly, even if your current best is cooking mac n' cheese.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I tried to save a few bucks by buying a controller used on eBay. That was a terrible decision. The controllers on eBay are almost all knock off brands, or in terrible condition. The controller I received didn't work correctly, and looked like it had been run through a blender. I immediately bought a new controller off Amazon to replace it, and have been perfectly happy. In my mind a brand new official Sony controller is the only way you'll get the perfect experience on your PS3
0547884591|5.0|Picked up the Kindle version of the book (being in France that was the easiest way to get my hands on it).<br />What i liked : great read, many topics on learning new skills, gives me great motivation to (re)start learning some languages or try out new things (knife throwing!!)<br />Also liked the zoom on cooking, and particularly simplification.<br />One thing to improve for the next book ?  : sometimes felt some sections of the book were a little all over the place, jumping from topic to topic. I am ok with this style but it may throw out some readers (and i admit on some skills or annecdotes, i was looking forward to a bit more... results, difficulties, ...)<br /><br />Altogether great book, great read, and something you want to share and keep as a reference and go back to.<br />Good job!
B0013ND36G|3.0|Terminator 3 is a sci-fi movie that continues the story of the beginning of the war between man and machine. Ultimately, the theme of the whole saga is the struggle of man against a seemingly insurmountable opponent. Terminator 3 is the act of the saga where the battle takes a dark turn for mankind. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken.<br /><br />In Terminator 3, an adult John Conner (Stahl) is living \\"off of the grid\\" as he grew up fearing a future he hoped he had prevented. However, a T-X model terminator (Loken) arrives from the future to wipe out the future resistance leaders and ensure that SkyNet goes online. The T-X is pursued through time by a T-850 (Schwarzeneggar) sent to protect Conner. Along the way, they rescue Kate Brewster (Danes) from the T-X. The judgment day that Conner once thought he helped stopped was only postponed, and it is a race to stop the machines from declaring war on humanity.<br /><br />On the whole, Terminator 3 is a decent movie when taken on its own. However, it does not hold up well when compared to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The weakest part of this movie is the believably of Stahl as John Conner. Part of this could be due to Conner being written as a weak character that needs to go through this story to become the leader he is meant to be, but Stahl's portrayal just doesn't make it believable that he is the same John Conner portrayed by Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 or Christian Bale in Terminator: Salvation.<br /><br />Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is rated R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudity. This is definitely not a movie for the kids. For fans of The Terminator, this is the weakest movie of the series, but it is still a vital part of the story of John Conner.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|It was a great movie, the cinematography was great, the actors did a wonderful job.  The location seemed real, I don't know if it was India, but it looked authentic.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I can't wait until each season becomes available. This will go down as a classic series with the perfect<br />ensemble cast and writing that gets better with each episode.. Jim Parsons brings to life a unique character surrounded by an hysterical cast of first-rate actors that are as just as talented. I cannot get enough..

B000002ITM|4.0|Testament's 5th studio album is a very overlooked one. It may not be as good as their old stuff or a modern classic like The Gathering either but it has some tracks that really stand out. Don't expect a thrash metal though, The Ritual is more hard rock along with a slower and more mature sound. Electric Crown is an awesome opening track and one of my favorite Testament songs, I was listening to it over and over again recently. Deadline is another one of my personal favorites off the album, they're all great though and very melodic. Fans that hated The Ritual are just very close minded and over opinionated. There's something that's called variety and the reason why I enjoyed The Ritual is because I listen to a lot of different music genres, rock and metal is my favorite but I'm also open to other stuff.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|No one wants to give a bad review to the beatles. Their last box sets got great reviews. I got my box set, the packaging and the book look great. The records were all defective. Horrible pressing job. And the music also doesn't sound worth being on vinyl as in the mastering processes or something makes it sound dull. I did a back to back with some original and 80s capital pressings and there is a huge difference. Just get this on USB or the CD box and buy used vinyl when you see it. Nostalgia isnt worth the heartache.
0425263908|5.0|Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness...<br /><br />Or in my case, during Hurricane Sandy and the blizzard of Halloween!<br /><br />I had been recommended this book over and over, but after reading and NOT being a 50 Shades fan, I kept putting it off. I guess the book reading gods must have gotten together & snowed me in for Trick or Treat, so I started reading and could not stop!!<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are damaged souls drawn to one another, and the sparks fly from the start! I'll admit that this book is not for everyone. It may claim to have some BDSM, but it doesn't; you won't find any red rooms of pain, contracts, inner goddesses or whatever here. Gideon is a rich and powerful man who is battling his own demons, and finds peace within the arms of Eva, who has her own emotional baggage. I normally don't like books with so much drama, but Gideon and Eva's story is kinda like a car crash on the turnpike. You shouldn't look, but you just can't stop yourself. I had to see what was going to happen next. I had to know what was driving Gideon toward's Eva, and why she kept running from him and to him at the same time. It's an emotional rollar coaster that will keep you up until the wee hours, because you can't put it down!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the next installment, and have already pre-ordered the third.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually like science fiction stories, but I liked this one.  It is well-written with excellent pacing and descriptions that enable you to picture a world that is (thankfully) so different from our own.  It draws you in and keeps you engaged to the last page.
B0075564A8|5.0|What a fantastic documentary. One every Madonna fan or even skeptic should own. It is raw, real, and genuine and makes us all see behind the curtain of an icon. Madonna is fearless and true to herself with no regrets. Madonna you are truly an icon.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|If you like vintage King you will like this book. I would recommend to anyone who likes this genre of books.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a well written book, a page-turner. The female characters are treated with more sympathy than the male characters, in general. My only real objection to the work is the excess of foul language. It may be realistic (though how would Rowling know?), but colloquialism could be suggested more subtlily.

0547884591|5.0|Tim did it again.  He wrote another book that is exciting as hell and can actually help you improve the quality of your life.  Don't believe it?  just pick something out and try it.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|No spoilers, but you've got to read this. Who knew that Pratchett and Gaiman would make such a great pair? All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />\\"Good Omens\\" is a unique book. I nearly split a gut laughing at parts, turned pages deep into the night in suspense, and yet found that the book really made me think about good and evil in a completely new way. In fact, I found \\"Good Omens\\" funnier than Vonnegut, and perhaps more thought provoking since Gaiman and Pratchett lack Vonnegut's misanthropy.<br /><br />The book is a terrific Fantasy, mining the core \\"mythology\\" about which Western Civilization turns -- the Judeo-Christian myth of Christ and anti-Christ and the Apocalypse. But it does it in a way that is once respectful of the tradition, and yet truly insightful. In the end, it makes you glad to be a human. Enjoying the simple things in life. Like remembering when you were a boy or girl of about 10, hanging with your friends. Playing pirates or baseball or dolls, wishing that the summer will never end.<br /><br />It also addresses the key metaphysical cunundrum of our age: \\"Why does every cassette that is left in a car morph into 'Queen's Greatest Hits'?\\"<br /><br />Fabulous book. Though some of your more Fundamentalist friends may disagree.
1469984202|5.0|Hugh Howey is a name to remember and his hypnotic oeuvre WOOL: Omnibus, is surely a piece for everyone's library. The engrossing story keeps you guessing, wanting more, and incites intrigue into questioning the very values that we hold dear in our society in terms of normalcy. Hugh's vision of a post-apocalyptic world is truly one that is well thought out and unique to the genre and without giving away any spoilers, one that truly captivated me and left me with a feeling of hope for the new age of authors. You will not be able to put it down and if you do, perhaps you should be sent for cleaning! A great story and a great find from an excellent author that is destined for an explosion of exposure.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard some hype about this book, not really detail about the plot. I've been wanting to read it but I've been waiting for my kindle to buy it. Surely enough, I got the kindle as a gift and the first book I bought was this one. I read the sample first and i was hooked. It was one of the best romance novels I have read because of the fact it was different than the typical. It has made me think about some things in a whole new light, and embrace and appreciate my current relationship a little more (because my significant other is capable of love!). The characters I can relate to, other than Christian grey. It was extremely entertaining, enough so that i finished in a few days (despite all the other work I have to do, I'm a college student). Some people complain that words are too repetitive, but we are repetitive in our lives and in our inside jokes and communications with people we are close with. So I don't see much harm in that. Overall, it was an easy read, entertaining, and enlightening.
B00361CAEE|2.0|The video seemed less about the fashion than about who is afraid of Anna, who seems like a business woman trying to do her job while those around her moan about her not being warm & fuzzy.  It all got old after 30 minutes or so.

While this book focuses on Sabriel's journey to find her father, you will find nothing similar to this book. Nix's writing style has a unique tone that carries this intricate plot forward and will send you out to the store to buy the next book in the trilogy in no time.

B009AZZ6H8|4.0|I'm sitting here at Starbucks, drinkling some bad coffee listening to \\"King Animal\\". Several of the reviews referenced Sonic Youth, Mudhoney and even Fugazi. I never put Soundgarden into that class. After first hearing the bass line on \\"Rowing\\", I was like, ohhhh, okay. \\"Attrition\\" starts off with feedback and fuzz, not a tight \\"Rusty Cage\\" hard rock feel, even though it's a fast song. It then settles into really cool vibe. \\"Worse Dreams\\" has a more late Soundgarden traditional pacing and feel, cool song, not my favorite though.<br /><br />\\"King Animal\\" is what used to qualify as \\"Alternative Rock\\" back in the 90's (not Breaking Benjamin, Nickleback or the other garbage polluting modern rock stations today). Chris Cornell's voice is nowhere near where it used to be...and Father Time remains undefeated. I really wasn't a huge fan of their later work. It was very mainstream. Many of the reviews are disappointed in the lack of hooks and memorable riffs. And that's cool, that is typically what defines great songs, memorable hooks. I thought \\"Spoonman\\" sucked, great hook and really popular, so it was just me, still thought it was lame. Also, there are some inevitable references to Audioslave. Kim Thayill (whose tone for musicians out there is off the chart great) sounds nothing like Tom Morello. Although not as punchy as Audioslave, there are no bizarre, noodling solos that completely interrupt the flow of the songs they appear in...so it has that going for it. Although there are several styles represented on \\"King Animal\\", each song taken on it's own merit is very cohesive and creative.<br /><br />More of the true alternative music will take some different paths. Much like \\"Louder Than Love\\" trampled all over popular hard rock in the early 90's. As an admittedly older guy (I had Louder Than Love on vinyl), I enjoy the new stuff for what it is. If you're looking for a return to a 25yr old style played by 25yr old musicians, \\"King Animal\\" probably won't work for you.<br /><br />\\"King Animal\\" is really good from a slower, trippier, acoustic, experimental perspective. Good album and it makes me curious to see what comes next.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|if you're a fan of donald fagen, you won't be disappointed.  perhaps not his best, but still very good, with his usual prowess at songwriting and keyboards... not to mention the amazing musicians he works with.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I love Bridgit's voice and I would listen to her all day.  I really wish some of these songs were less hip-hop feel and her voice was given a chance to spend some time on a good melody.  I do really enjoy the CD, but I'm waiting for her to do something more grown-up.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is a remainder of the many cruelties that exist and that we need to be aware and involved on what goes on around us. We cannot be complacent about events or these atrocities will happen again.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|So happy that they have finally started releasing this series in individual volumes. Having not watched this since the syndicated run in the 80's and only recalling the goofier episodes from the later seasons like the BIONIC BIGFOOT episode I was really surprised at how slow paced and serious the shows tone was at the beginning.<br /><br />Steve Austin was really unhappy at having become half man, half machine and the show took it's time to let you feel the pathos of his situation.  The pacing in these earlier episodes, particularly the pilot can be a little drawn out at times, especially compared to today's breakneck storytelling techniques but at the same time it's quite refreshing to see them linger on a shot of STEVE AUSTIN moving his newly bionic fingers and contemplating his situation.<br /><br />The picture quality and sound are about what you'd expect and the packaging is topnotch. The show is a fun journey into television history. Now when are they re-releasing the 12 inch doll with the see through Bionic eye feature?
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read all three and even though they are categorized for teenage readers it was a nice quick read into a fictional fantasy future world.

034580404X|1.0|The worst books I have ever read!  I do NOT understand all the publicity and hype surrounding these!  The books are poorly written and the &#34;love&#34; scenes are repetitive and boring.  I forced myself to read into the second book, and then I quit.  I just couldn't take it anymore!  The plot and writing never got any better!

B0082JYAZ2|4.0|As an album, it's not as congruent as I'd like it to be.<br /><br />I like most of the songs, but not all.  I'm already a Regina Spektor fan.<br /><br />I really like the first three tracks: Small Town Moon, Oh Marcello, Don't Leave Me, and track 5, Patron Saint.  I like them, because they are a bit more bouncy.<br /><br />Of course, the thing with Regina Spektor is that you must listen to her music several times before you can love it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love this app it is awesome, finds the song and video that you are looking for and dwnlds it in a fast and timely manner.
0525952926|4.0|Although I probably now have carpal tunnel in both wrists, holding this book and really turning pages are just the physical &#34;joys&#34; of this tome. I had read the first installment of the trilogy and thought that perhaps I would have to review it before starting this chapter. Not so, my friend. It stands alone!!  Too many times I found myself saying &#34;that's too convenient&#34; or &#34;that's too contrived&#34;, but that didn't keep me from plowing on. I enjoyed all of the stories, the relationships, and explanations of situations during the 30's and 40's that were illuminating. Can we ever know too much about WW II ? I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history or just a good read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Different take on mystery novel. Was slow moving but I couldn't put it down. Had never heard of this author but gave it a chance. Since then I've read her other two novels which are all great.

0061120081|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is a powerful book that has taught life lessons to young and old readers. Set in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, the protagonist, Scout or Jeah Louise, is a brave, funny, outspoken tomboy who must overcome the challenge of society. This book will mesmerize readers to read until they finish the book.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book for middle school students who enjoy classic novels, humor, and mystery because it's all three genres! If the reader is interested in mystery they will like this book because you will want to learn more about the mysterious Boo Radley. There is also a feeling of humor in the book as we look at the world through Scout's eyes. Lastly, like most classic novels, the book leaves us with a sense of who we are as people, and the innocence and cruelty we show as humans.<br /><br />In closing, To Kill a Mockingbird is a deeply moving novel filled with hardships and surprises. Whether you're a young adult or old, To Kill a Mockingbird is an amazing book that you will remember forever.<br /><br />By: Z.MDC
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My kids LOVE this book! Over and over, &#34;YOU TURNED ANOTHER PAGE!&#34; My 3-year-old can quote it now, so she reads it to my 2-year-old! Precious! Great book!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Money grab!  Half way through the first book, I just skipped through pages, trying to get to the story.  It's there somewhere!  The trilogy could have been one book.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|UNO is one of my favorite childhood games. My 9 yr old grandson loves this game and sometimes wehn he starts playing it on my kindle fire I can't get him to stop.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I, personally, loved this movie.  Entertaining, leaves you on th edge of your seat and there are also alternate endings which are interesting to watch.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|In the beginning, I had my doubts on Twitter. But really, it's amazing! For those of you that cant gt updates, too bad so sad. Because when I got it, the twitter symbol was still the old one. It updated by itself, one day! So get it!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Money grab!  Half way through the first book, I just skipped through pages, trying to get to the story.  It's there somewhere!  The trilogy could have been one book.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|I realize many people are upset that these aren't the extended versions of the episodes with the \\"deleted scenes\\" included as part of the episodes as they did for the DVD set.  However, keep in mind, the sound and picture quality are amazing for a 90s sitcom, and the packaging and included booklet are fabulous. I've seen so much detail that I never noticed in the hundreds of times I've watched the DVD episodes. In summary, I choose to focus on the fact that I can finally watch my favorite show in HD widescreen Blu-Ray, instead of getting over-focused on the drawbacks. And remember, these episodes are how the show was meant to be watched. :)
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Funny, entertaining and I like Depp as an actor; can't go wrong in my eyes.<br /><br />There were some pretty unreal parts but it was all in fun and a great Halloween movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you know how to did iron red stone or diamond please right down hownand I willnread through the reviews
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Money grab!  Half way through the first book, I just skipped through pages, trying to get to the story.  It's there somewhere!  The trilogy could have been one book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the controls better on my iphone version than this one.  It was confusing to get used to going back and looking at the categories or searching from one big menu.  I love pinterest nonetheless!
0061474355|4.0|I love this book! The story is well written and creative; a great start to the series. The main character is a solid and strong female lead, and the plot draws you in from the first page. The supporting characters are also well devoloped, and the world is very vivid. The only negative I have is that I don't care for this edition's cover as much as the older one.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I went into this having read many reviews, some glowing and some scathing. Being a huge fan of the Alien franchise I did expect a lot, and although my original expectations weren't met (I admit they were pretty high) I still liked the move quite a bit.<br /><br />I do have to say that I do wish they had included more creatures, and sure there were a few silly, yell at the screen stupid character moments but isn't that what makes these kinds of movies fun?<br /><br />For the most part I enjoyed it - and I do like how they set things up at the end.<br /><br />I say check it out, I had a good time with it and can't wait for more.
B0007RT9LW|4.0|Gone in 60 seconds turn out to be a great film for car fans.  Cage did a good job on the movie and the supporting cast did a wonderful job also backing him up for the movie.  What did it for me was the amazing car chase scene threw the city as cops chase Cage threw the city.  This is also the Director's cut so we get few extra minutes of film not in regular version.  So if your looking for some intense car chase scenes, be able to see some very classic cars in their own beauty follow by some good music from the soundtrack, then this is the movie for you.  Yes it is a remake but a very good one at that fact, well worth the money for the movie to watch at least once or twice.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I like this album sooooooooo much better than their new one.  The only thing I like better about the new one is the male singer seemed a little more confident in his singing ability.  I wish he would have been a little stronger in this album.  Anyway, they are amazing and I would recommend this album to anyone and everyone! Their sound is so unique and I haven't found anyone else quite like them!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is a terrible book. I bought it after hearing Ms Rowling's evening with Charlie Rose and found her charming, unpretentious and totally honest. The book has been a great disappointment, I suspect that had she tried to publish it before the Potter books and resulting fame The Casual Vacancy would not have been published. The language is appalling, the characters 'universally losers\\" and a total lack of a meaningful message. Don't waste your time or money!
B0081L391C|5.0|I have never seen the original series so I didn't have anything to compare to. The movie was hysterical, especially because I graduated high school in 2005 so I could totally identify with the story line. Both actors did an amazing job and Ice Cube's appearance was great too. The storyline was also legitimate, nothing far fetched or drawn out.
B0049VZ222|5.0|A good and fun series, recommend for a good weekend marathon. The special effects and story line are very good
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yes, this is just a porno with some rich dude bossing around a young girl the whole time and she just takes it because she's obviously infatuated with him and his \\"dark secrets.\\"  It's just another twilight but with some porn thrown into the mix and nothing that exciting happening.  I have read over half of the book and, as of this moment, I have no desire to pick it up and keep reading.  Go read something better, something more intriguing and educational. Don't waste your money!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Just bought myself a Voyager Pro-HD Bluetooth headset, and I want to keep this one for a while so I bought this nifty little case made for it. Hopefully, this will prevent me from losing my headsets.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I could do without the ads. a good feature would be to be able to clear the score each time you open the game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I installed this app on my phone to keep the kids quiet. Now they fight over who gets to play it. I played it and it's addictive! Great game!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I listened to this album over and over. There is not one song on this album that I don't like.  Everything about it is amazing. Not very many bands come out with such a strong first album.  I hope their sound stays the same and I am looking forward to hearing more of them! Amazon always has this album on sale so I would recommend getting this even if you are not sure because it is a good deal and you'll fall in love with them!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love rereading this story. The moral of it is timeless. It's a classic for a reason. Easy format, too.
B0058SNI58|4.0|Overall I really love them, my only problem is that they make a noise when you walk because of the material.  Easily fixed with a piece of cotton inside the shoe.  Very comfortable!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it and just can't put it down. Its colorful and I find it easy and enjoyable and you can't beat free!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|A little dark at times but she has an amazing voice and is total Hollywood glam.  You'll get these songs stuck in your head very quickly! I look forward from hearing more of her!
B0036SSZIC|5.0|America is full of greedy people. Capitalism doesn't work.<br />I'm buying gifts for my grandchildren, all 5 of them on<br />a very tiny income. I like socialism where people<br />help each other. Now, you hardly get to know your<br />neighbors!
B004SBX112|5.0|I love Angry Birds. Since I don't play many online games, this one is perfect for my Kindle. My granddaughter and daughter also love all the versions of angry birds. There is something therapeutic about demolishing those green piggies. Best non-threatening game around. Reminds me of the old PacMan.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Sigh No More is a lovely album and pairs delightfully with their newest, Babel. I would recommend this album to anyone interested in Mumford and Son's music.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|Good album,  I liked the songs.  None of them made me want to listen to it over and over, though.  It is pretty slow and is something I would listen to before I go to bed.  I still love the XX and I like some of the new trance like sounds they've incorporated into their music but I want some more happy upbeat songs next time that make me want to listen over and over and share with others like I wanted to for their last album! There was so much build up for this album and I wish they could have topped their last one.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|loved it from the beginning till the end. it gives a very detailed view on the life of one of the best endurance runners of modern times.
B004AQR29C|4.0|great action film, many leading actors portrayed in roles that are not the usual for them. enjoyed it very much
B000057H8P|1.0|I love this movie but unfortunately the DVD I was sent had something wrong with it and it did not work.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Every album of theirs is good, they can do no wrong! Amazing band through and through. Would recommend this album to everyone!!! I don't have anything bad to say about them!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|even if you were not interested in running and the long distance facets of it, this book is still a great read.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a good solid title that is great for first time Kindle book builders (and for others who have done it before but had trouble figuring out why things didn't work right.)  A quick, easy read that gets you the information without wasting your time.  It saved me  from a lot of headaches.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons out-do themselves again -- Babel is a terrific album and a necessity for any M&S fan, truly.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|This was one of my faves from 2011.  I listened to it for a few months straight.  I like the direction that this band is going and I hope they keep it up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun.i love this game.i try to play it as often as i can.kung fu scrat rocks.a game within a game. you cant beat that!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A very entertaining movie that contains a valuable life lesson.  Not often you can be entertained and enlightened at the same time.  Still have no desire to go to India, but I do apply lessons to my own life right here.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Since I never heard of this film, I thought it couldn't be all that wonderful.  Trust me, all of the positive reviews are dead on.  This is a film that when you think you know what is going to happen next, the writer cleverly changes direction.  Oh yeah, this film is going to surprise you with the ending. You will smile really big, and the next evening watch it again.  It's that good.
B00138H68M|5.0|I loved this album back in High School.  It is solid and every song is good. I would still recommend this album to anyone who likes the strokes or has never heard of them before!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved it. I was an avid Harry Potter fan as a child and was reticent to read something by Rowling what was not related to the books I had loved so dearly but I am glad I did. I think it was a brutally honest book about the world that people think that they live and the realities that they refuse to accept because it may not be what they had pictured their life looking like. It does have a heavy amount of swearing and sexual references, but then again it is written for adults and not young adults so let's hope people can handle it. If you are not a fan of books such as Girl, Interrupted then don't pick this up. It is well written and the multiple voices weave together a beautiful story that is heart wrenching and wonderfully written.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son and I enjoy it at different levels and it does keep you hooked. He loves to play it at night because it lights up the kindle :) Fun single player enjoyment.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|This is for my Gramddaughter and I know she will love it.  It arrived promptly and in good condition.  I cant wait till she opens it.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I bow at the knee of Michael Connelly and anxiously await each and every new release. This book of short stories is perfect for &#34;tiding me over&#34; till that happens. Mr Connelly never fails to please me although this book would naturally satisfy me more if the stories were not quite as short as they are here. Still, they are as tightly composed as his longer books and I will be content, mostly, until the next new book is in my hands.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have been a member of facebook for several years & I find it easier to go on it with the Kindle.  Only problems I have found is that I seem to be unable to &#34;share&#34; with it & I can't play my games either :-(
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the old-fashioned, no &#34;fancy&#34; different ways of playing the game.  Just basic solitaire like I watched my Granny play with real deck of cards.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Been wanting this cd.  It did arrive promptly and in good condition.  I love the cd as I do all of Enya's
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the second book in a trilogy that Ken Follett is writing. I would recommend beginning with the first, Fall of Giants, if you haven't already read it as the characters/families carry through. He does a wonderful job bringing the history of the 20th century to life.<br /><br />The second book primarily focuses on events leading up to and continuing through World War II. The story is told from the perspective of several characters in Russia, Britain, Germany, and the U.S., giving the opportunity to see history from a variety of points of view.<br /><br />Mr. Follett is an extraordinary teller of tales in a historical context. I would also recommend his earlier books on the building of cathedrals in Europe, Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, for a great window into life in Medieval Europe.
0783117523|5.0|AWESOME TELLING OF A TRAGIC STORY! FANTASTIC FILMING, COSTUMES, ACTING, CHARACTERS, AND ANGELINA LOOKS INCREDABLE!! I owned this movie before, and someone borrowed it, SO I HAD TO BUY IT AGAIN! ONE OF MY FAVORITES!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Don't know what I would do without this product.  Yahoo seems to be having more problems lately.  But unlike friends, don't want to switch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a kindle book that I am having a great time reading.  It is holding my interest  quite well.
B007MDB548|5.0|She keeps watching this movie non-stop since I purchased it for her. She has the Tinkerbell movie as well but she is really entranced by this movie. I am purchasing many of the characters from this movie on Disney.com!
B000006XSD|5.0|ALICE HITS IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH ONE! EVERY TRACK A HIT! YOU WON'T SKIP A SONG! A NECESSARY PART OF ANY ALICE COOPER FANS COLLECTION!!
B009Z5975A|5.0|Three great classic movies, the reason for writing this brief review is that I don't understand the Jan 2013 release date?<br />This is selling in my local Wal-Mart for $10<br />Do yourself a favor, grab a bargain for Christmas.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was very disappointed in this film.  The eye candy was fine but the story seemed disjointed.  I think the weight loss on Matthew hurt rather than helped him.  He could have held his own being himself.  I was yawning after about 20 minutes but watched til the end.  It didn't get any better.
160774273X|5.0|I enjoy reading thru it and learning. Honestly I don't like the recipes. Way too time consuming and the breads taste too yeasty for my taste and the crusts are difficult to cut. I prefer a basic baguette. But they do come out looking just like in the photos. Guests loved my experiments. I like baking in the french oven - the only issue is I'm a wimp and I'm really afraid of getting burned since you have to cook it really really hot.
0307454568|5.0|AFTER READING THE FIRST I WAS ALL BUT COMPELLED TO CONTINUE THE SERIES!!  IT IS TRUELY A SHAME THAT STIEG PASSED AWAY BEFORE HE COULD PEN MORE MASTERPIECES!
B005V4FJC4|3.0|I was hoping for something a bit more unique but this CD tends to sound pretty run of the mill.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Bought this for a daughter-in-law who has never seen it!  Giving it with fond memories of loving it as a child and again with my children.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast moving.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Did not want to stop reading.  Suspenseful and entertaining.  Have never been disappointed with a Baldacci book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book. Honestly, it had me checking over my shoulder when I was finished! Very surprising and dramatic. Overall, it was amazing.
B0015AARJI|5.0|These were purchased for young children who will give them a workout.  Sony quality is obvious and they appear durable.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|Did the Stones need another compilation album? Definitely not. And now in the digital age where all these songs have been available individually (and uncut) for a long time, this seems even more un-needed. But this Super Deluxe version of the set is very well done. The book is amazing with some great pics and history. It comes with a cool poster and some postcards along with the CDs. The price tag is a bit much and the packaging isn't going to fit in nicely with your collection. But if you're a Stones completist or in need of the single versions of a lot of their hits, this is good roundup.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book and thought it well worth the 2.99 that I spent. The story is engaging, especially the first part. I agree that this guy needs to get an editor to clean up the grammar errors, but also have to comment that his errors were minor enough, i am not a grammarophile, that it didn't detract from my enjoyment of reading his story. I will certainly buy the next book in this series. I was impressed enough that I felt it important to add to this stories very impressive 5 star rating.
0446580848|4.0|Love the DeMille style with caustic sarcasm.  Well done with never ending surprises though dragged on in parts.  Great ending
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book wraps up the story line and completes the series. Now the reader knows all there is to know about the past and the mind of Christian Grey.
B009186E3O|5.0|Another piece of Stones history the band has taken too long to release. Just for the historical value this is a must-have. Great footage and interviews and a cool insight into a group that would soon go on to sell out shows around the world for another 48 years. The packagine is really well done. Cool poster, great bonus show and nice display all-around.
0307943259|4.0|I chose the book because it was a Grisham book.<br />He usually keeps me guessing until the end.  This time I had figured out that he was working with the excaped man. After that realization, many clues to who was doing what became apparent.
6305428042|5.0|This movie is great.  I will watch it every year for halloween.  It's a nice family movie.  I recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is fantastic! The story line keeps the reader curious and wanting to know more. The steamy scene between Christian and Ana are just a bonus.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The program is does the job well enough, but has a few issues.  Most readers have outlined some, here are mine:<br /><br />1. Sometimes the program insists on being connected to the internet, or it closes.  I recently was unable to get any planned reading on a flight done because I didn't have a connection.  I was livid.  A pdf reader shouldn't need an internet connection to read a locally stored file, but I can't replicate this so I suppose it is a one off thing.<br /><br />2. The text reflow mode is a very good idea, but not much use to those trying to get work done since you have to annotate on the actual PDF itself.<br /><br />3. Even in continuous text mode, the program has a tendency to \\"snap\\" to a page end easily.  This is frustrating, and if I wanted it to snap to a page I'd use single page mode.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the best trilogies out there today! It sucks you right in from the first book. You will be dreaming about Fifty shades!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I have been listening to the 2 cd set constantly since I recieved the box set last week, what a great concert, I wish I could have been there, I love the set list, my only complaint I wish they could have included at least one song from \\"In Through The Out Door\\", so far I have seen the Blu-Ray disc only once, I really enjoyed it, it gives you the feel like you were at the concert, I haven't watched the bonus DVD yet, I was really impressed with the band they sounded great together, it doesn't sound like they haven't played together in many years, I was very impressed with Jason Bonham his Dad would have been proud, I highly recommend the new box set.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The second book in this series is just as good as the first. The read gets more insight into the mind of Christian Grey and how his past affects his future.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|What great tales there are in history! I have seen other series on Roman history such as &#34;I Claudius&#34; but &#34;Rome&#34; tops them all. I simply love the sets, they are so detailed and real. The overall atention to detail is astounding. To my knowledge for example, no other similar production has detailed the religious aspect of the Romans like this production. Please HBO give us more !
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was a perfect gift for a new teacher just starting out!!  This item made this new teacher to be very happy bsed on the Kindle project in the classroom
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is amazing. I loved it. It is a great book for tweens. It wad great. It was the best diary of a simply kid book I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002OMZTSU|5.0|A very funny yet poignant story of Craig's  life adventure.  My favorite book of the year!  Thank you Mr. Ferguson.
0307744434|5.0|I stumbled across this book, as I do with many great books, and I'm so glad I did.  The writing is vivid and lovely.  Erin Morgenstern is a master story teller and I recommend this book highly.<br /><br />The book is long and the story is enchanting.  I kept hoping, as I read, that this one would be made into a movie - however, now I'm afraid no one could do justice to the beautiful imagery within its pages.<br /><br />If you have a great imagination and love fantasy/mystery and interesting characters...this one's for you!<br /><br />Great book club book.
0141197307|5.0|A fabulous visual joy ride!!  A perfect marriage between a timeless story and an artistic icon!!  I recommend highly recommend this book.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It wasn't anything like I thought it would be. I have not read the Harry Potter books so I wasn't comparing this work with anything else the author had written. I didn't really find any redeeming qualities to the characters in the book. Nothing redemptive as far as I could tell.
030758836X|2.0|Although this is 'critically acclaimed' and the plot is certainly intriguing, I would like to know when using the 'f' word (and all other profanity) prolifically and flippantly became so acceptable? It does NOT add to the story but rather takes away from it. I don't understand why today's authors feel the need to pepper their books with such filth. I didn't appreciate the horrific porn descriptions in the book, either. A simple statement such as, \\"The porn discovered in your shed was of a rather....unseemly...nature.\\" I averted my eyes and skipped over the paragraph that described the titles and photos on the porn in the book. There were a number of other portions of the book I skipped over as well. Yuck. I will get my money back on this one and am so sorry I ever wasted my hard earned dollars on it in the first place. Never again with this author.<br /><br />Any authors that read this - come on! Clean it up and I promise, it's still a great plot and an even better book because of it. Quit contributing to the normalization of utter filth.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is the first in the Abhorsen Trilogy but can be read as a stand alone novel. The novel is different in the sense that the protagonist is a female but she is not bound to the tropes most heroines faced. Sabriel is an 18 year old girl from a country similar to England in the 1930s. She comes across a normal teenage girl, except for the fact that she is the daughter of the Abhorsen, the person who banishes the dead that terrorizes the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />The novel contains a perfect blend of action, angst, romance and humour. Sabriel is joined by Mogget, a talking cat with a mysterious past, and Touchstone, a young man with his own demons as she first tries to find her father and then stop the reign of Kerrigor, the main antagonist.<br /><br />I first read Sabriel over a decade ago and I have not regretted it. The novel is beautifully written and one of the first that has a hero who happens to be a female as well a hero that is not reluctant to fulfill her destiny. I give Sabriel five stars and is recommended for anyone that loves fantasy and strong characters.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A great book!  Scarpetta never fails to deliver.  Loved the reference to Northern Alberta and Grande Prairie.  What a thrill to see your home town in a book from one of your favorite authors.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|has anyone gotten a marmalade 5.2.1.....error? I keep getting it from someone using a ipad 3. was just curious. I love the game.
B003F1WM2K|1.0|Kind of a boring story. I know it got good reviews from other readers, but it didn't work for me.
0446580848|1.0|I am a DeMille fan. Was this a good read? No. Dialogue must propel the reader forward. The author's propensity to interrupt speech with what the author might think is accent, tone or emotion only served to disrupt the rhythm so much that I couldn't go on past page 325. I really tried as I liked the story and particularly enjoyed the set pieces explaining Yeman. I liked the characters and Corey's humor but I could not go on with the stutter step dialogue.<br /><br />i.e page 300, Buck furthur explained, \\"We were the victims of an apparent Al Qaeda attack. We don't want to be seen as aggressors or provacateurs.\\" BUCK ALSO INFORMED US, \\"There are certain groups in the States who are not in favor  of our Hellfire assassination program\\". HE ADDED, \\"The incident, if it became public, could be misinterpreted as offensive rather than defensive.\\"<br /><br />The were too many \\"replied\\", \\"added\\", \\"assured\\", \\"continued\\" etc. inserted that wouldn't let this reader go forward with any sustained momentum.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|After all the hype about the film I knew I had to read the book first. I enjoyed the story/stories, very much thought that some of the  consequential progression was disjointed. The movie claims high praise. I hope it is earned.
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|Love this book.  It is a true classic.  Wish Julia was still around to teach us how to cook!  Thanks.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|sweet I love this game so addictive. I'm glad they have it for my kindle. really awesome. cool amazing cool
0671027344|5.0|I've read the book before purchasing it, I just wanted it to reread. I love the book, I'm glad I own it now, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about high schoolers with problems.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It was an excellent movie.  It closely followed the book and left the violence to your imagination.  I highly recommend seeing the movie after reading the book.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Great story of Americans and Yemeni working together to accomplish an enormously unlikely miracle.<br />No shooting, no car races, just a feel good time.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Nerdy humor but one that everyday people would find funny. The episodes go so fast because I enjoy watching it so much. My friends love this show as well and we often watch it together.  This has good re-watch value. The Big Bang Theory is a must see series.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book not knowing she was a &#34;children's author&#34;. It was an easy read but this book is for children and adults alike.  I already purchased the next book in the &#34;series&#34;.
B002RSDW8A|2.0|This movie was a miss for me although I usually like this director's films.<br />The main character is not very likable and Julia Child is whitewashed to seem more likable than she was. That aside, the story is slow without much of a message.<br />BTW, when the lobsters were boiled alive as a comedy bit, I was totally turned off. Lobsters actually feel incredible pain when cooked alive by a person too cowardly to show them mercy by killing them first! It is a complete myth that they do not feel the boiling water like we do. And I especially dislike filmmakers treating cruelty as humor without making it clear that this actually IS cruelty. This may seem like a small detail to some people, but it made me dread watching the rest of the film from that point on.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Allows anyone to really understand how or economy was changed dramatically. Even if you don't have a lot of experience in a financial or economics background, you will still be able to fully understand and enjoy this movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is essentially the second half of Book 4. There are some great reviews of it so I won't go into great detail. Some people love it, some hate it. You have to understand what's going on with the series. The land is recovering from a devastating war. The characters have all scattered to survive and are rebuilding their lives. These two books update the activities of the main characters in their new situations. I have faith that Book 6 will bring everyone back together and their saga will continue in a more organized manner. Book 3 is still the best of the series.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I find that listening to Enya's music is always soothing, but not soporific. Her vocals are so clear, and so rhythmic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book with unexpected turns and twists also very eye opening. Hard to believe humans could be so cruel.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I am now in the third installment of this historical fantasy retelling the esploits of the Kings and Kingdoms of the imagined past.  The author is resplendent in the discriptions of the knights armerment, the court ladys finary with embelishments discribed in great entertaining detail.  The family histories  are continously brought into the story line so the reader is not lost to those important pieces of ancestry which leads to the continuing changes of the rulers of ancient times<br />Battles and wars have always been the manner of changes in the past as George R. R. Martin shares the  desciptions of the bloodiest and most horrifiing of scenerios one could image.<br />A continuing episode that cannot be laid to rest until the next chaper is consumed.
0061474355|5.0|When I first read this book, all those years ago, the world felt so familiar to me, even during my first read, that I was convinced that this book was based on some long-ago myth, something that I had encountered years before, and forgotten about. I only realized later that Garth Nix's masterful world-building and incredible characters were so clearly drawn that it only felt like they were familiar to me. The story of Sabriel has remained a favorite for a very long time, and will remain so for years to come. If I made a list of things I love about books, this book would probably contain about 90%, if not every single item on that list. A strong female character? Check. A new world to explore? Double check - there are two! And one of them has magic, a kind I'd never seen before! A completely believable romance that doesn't overshadow the story and does justice to both characters? It could go on forever. I love this book, and I will always love this book.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Enya's recordings, and this is one of my favorite CDs in my collection. Good choice of songs.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|I love this movie!!!  It is such a fun movie yet with serious plot!  I've watched this movie over and over and I always see something I missed.  I used a scene from this movie for my acting class, wne over very well.  Meg Ryan is awesome!  All of the stars in this movie get a thumbs up from me!!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This is the first Nelson DeMille I'd read and my first introduction to John Corey.  Initially, I found his glibness annoying, until it was revealed that other characters in the book found him somewhat annoying, albeit entertaining, too.  He reminds me of Tony on NCIS.  Nevertheless, he grew on me, and I found his comments pretty funny--a bit of comic relief amidst murder investigations.  The plot was intriguing (you don't need another synopsis) and fast paced.  Would definitely try another DeMille.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is another great family film; exactly what I'd expect from Disney/Pixar. The best part was that the entire film was focused on the story line - not political nonsense!<br /><br />We watched this as a family after Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved it!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, so had to have this anniversary edition. I will always love this movie, Julie Andrews and all. It is especially fun to watch after visiting the Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont and hearing about Maria von Trapp, and the story of the Trapp Family Singers - how they came to the US, and were a successful singing group.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|There is a lot of action in this movie but the acting is not good.  I did not enjoy this movie.
B004KPLZKA|4.0|I bought this for the song, Wantcha Back, which I love, but the other songs are just OK to good.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This might be the best Marvel comic book movie made yet. I loved some of the others, especially Thor and Captain America - but seeing all of these heroes together was fantastic.<br /><br />No spoilers - but I was a little disappointed that the plot wasn't a bit more developed around The Hulk...a small criticism...certainly not a big deal!
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|Heard a piece of &#34;How&#34; and liked it, bought the cd on mp3 on a whim.  It's great!  I'll definitely keep track of her.
0547884591|5.0|I am reading this book right now - I bought it the day it came out (who can beat $4.99?). Tim Ferriss' book The 4 Hour Work-Week was the sole reason I launched my perfect career running the knitting video website knitfreedom.com. I followed every step in his book (really, I promise) and have been living my dream for the past two years - including living in Argentina for a total of 7 months. People are amazed at my success, and I tell them, \\"just follow every step in the 4-Hour Work-Week and you can do it too!\\"<br /><br />So when Tim came out with the 4-Hour Chef, it wasn't a hard call to buy the book. I'm just through the introduction, and I'm so impressed with all the work he's done and the high-intensity learning techniques he has experimented with and refined over the years, so that we can all benefit from his results. I'm especially interested in how this book can help my two young nephews do better in school - on their spelling and math tests, and maybe make learning more enjoyable for them.<br /><br />The book is easy and entertaining to read: lots of real-life examples and entertaining stories to help you get the idea and not get bogged down in straight theory. There are a few things I'd like to learn to do really well: sing, and dance salsa. I'm excited to apply the DiSSS and CAFE concepts (see? I remembered the acronyms!) to those two goals. Thanks for another fabulous book, Tim! Really well done.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I would have given this movie 5 stars if someone else had been cast as Snow White, maybe someone capable of showing human emotion, but otherwise it's a great flick.
B0088TG252|5.0|Can Denzel MAKE a bad movie? I don't think so...If you like action and intrigue; you're going to love this movie!
B009KKLQKO|5.0|As many have noted , this is approx half of a show from the recent Beach Boys 50th anniversary tour.  There is a lot of griping about what it isn't.  But what it is , is a chance , especially if you were not able to attend in person , to get a sense of the history of this iconic band.  Just look at how many hits aren't there !!!!!  The crowd shots help convey the spirit and joy that these finely crafted , timeless compositions of Brian Wilson and company inspire.  I think we will get a full live concert CD and DVD  / Blue Ray in the near future , but for now and for the price this is a bargain.
B004GYY714|4.0|A  great application in general.  However, when choosing a station you are often re-directed to a similar station  which may be anywhere in the country thus negating any preference you might have for local, more familiar stations.

B0013WJGJ0|5.0|I have young kids and wanted to introduce them to the Batman series - but thought that some of the newer flicks - while GREAT movies, might be a bit dark for my kiddos. Instead, we watched this, and they loved it! They can't wait to see the next one!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|Unlike most gameloft game this doesn't have a dumb energy mechanic to keep you from playing more than five minutes a day. This alone makes it worth it.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Jodi Picoult has an astonishing writing style.  The book is all things; good, solid humor, writing style unique and never leaves you wanting and all of this touched with a ture bit of sadness.  Did I mention a wonderful read if you have any interest in medical science.  You don't have to have the latter, but if you do love the science, this then becomes a must read.  I am ordering her next book soon.  She has a gift and shares it with us.  Thank you Jud!
B00845PT18|1.0|I swear you could even see it in Cage's eyes as he acted that he was ashamed of this stinker.  Urinating jokes...really?  A plot that has been done a million times.  Innocent kid with a legacy of dark powers that the evil guys want to capture to kill and take his powers.  Give me a break.

0446547646|4.0|Good, solid book...did not engage me personally to his key characters like most of his books have, although this has happened before....makes me think it's likely a publisher/contract issue that pushes out less quality but more books...<br /><br />Anyway, a good read, but not in the class of his best work....
0345803493|5.0|I barely have time to read, but so glad I made the time to read this series.  I couldn't put the book down.  I hope the movie isn't a disappointment!
B005LAII6C|5.0|Seriously wtf r all these 1 & 2 stars review? Theyre so lame the movie is great its 2012 so what if one of the charecters is gay. So what if he speaks to the dead?  Whats ur point, the story line is amazing the animation is too. Its a movie people lighten up, I mean Belle is a gold digger, Ariel married at 16 lol still good movies tho lol.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Incredibly good music! This being so with some tracks not as great as they could have been vocally, mastered and mixed, stripped down, but if you are basing whether or not you should buy this CD based on \\"Girl On Fire\\"...vocally, not a favorite, but as a fan I was going to buy this album cos Ms. keys is so worthy based on what she's given in the past. Very few albums over time have been recorded and every track was seemless, but this gem hits it out of the park with 101, We Make Fire, Brand New Me and so many others. I wasn't expecting but, maybe one or two singles, I would like. But, I was amazed and felt like a million dollar baby after my second listen! \\"Girl On Fire\\" does what GREAT music is supposed to do! If you love Keys in her lower register, you're in for a magical musical encounter, for real!!!
B003E74B24|5.0|Highly recommend seller, look forward to future purchases . . . . . . . . . . . .
0345803485|5.0|I was ordering book 2 while reading book 1!!  &#34;Wow&#34; is all I can say...Love this series. I actually am having a book club meeting over this trilogy!!
B0041KVW2K|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already... Poor sound quality, noisy pressings, distortion... etc.. The music is fantastic, The remasters themselves are top notch, but the vinyl quality is another story. Who did Capitol think they were selling to? People who buy vinyl LISTEN TO IT! We are not collectors, we are AUDIOPHILES and want the music to sound the best it can. If you cut corners, we will HEAR IT! I can't help but feel this is a big F. U. from capitol. Now I am back to buying the OLDER pressings that SOUND BETTER! Avoid this set...
B008L1VZS6|5.0|A beautiful, refreshing and entertaining work. Well sung and elegantly staged. All lead singers are well suited to their roles, and they do an excellent job in presenting this neglected gem. I loved Guido Loconsolo and Anna Caterina Antonacci whose engaging performance added even more to this joyful presentation. Thank you Pier Luigi Pizzi for your stage direction that does not insult the audience, especially for not covering the performers with modern garments so that the stupid audience will understand that this work transcends time and place constraints!

B004FEFS5E|4.0|It's quite amazing how much I am learning from reading this book without fully realizing it.  Bryan makes it all seem quite simple.  A great introduction to using your camera and photography techniques and composition.  Every budding photographer should really read this book and put their camera on &#34;M&#34;.

B000FC13MM|5.0|This is the first book of the Old Kingdom Trilogy, by far one of the best fantasy works ever! It is dark and smart with well-developed characters in an amazingly creative world that is a mixture of modern and past, technology and magic. A must read!
0792838912|5.0|Why don't they make movies like this anymore!!!! every scene and every detail is to be savoured!! Watch it over and over again!!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|this game just seemed too complicated and not entertaining enough to really make it worthwhile learning how to use it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is DeMille at his peak. Exciting, clever plot, but most of all, hilariously funny, and wickedly irreverent! I recommend it without reservation.
B00866JL96|5.0|This is a great movie! I've let several people borrow it and everyone says the same thing...they love it! I would recommend to everyone.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|You just can't go wrong with a bunch of hot vampires...nice ones, evil ones....they are all sexy as hell...OH yeah, and the show is super good too/. :) I personally love the writing and the fast paced part of the show.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|The real life of men and women! The acting is wonderful...it is a funny, feel good, cute movie that makes you think about all your relationships. I love this movie, highly recommend for anyone - man or woman.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Weaker than Life Aquatic but acceptable if you enjoy this particular genre. It is all promise: I like the premises of the show, and continue hoping it will be a good ''installment''. It is not, but you will watch it because the style builds a certain loyalty. I like Bill Murray a lot, yet his part is minor and essentially not much in character. It's like saying, give some stars, because I still want Wes Anderson to make movies like that, only better.
B009329Y30|4.0|Great story, no violence, nudity, profanity, a movie everyone can watch and enjoy.  I would recommend this movie to anyone
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Loved this CD!  I was skeptical about her pairing up with a Donny Osmond, but it worked  well.  We love Boyle's voice.
0439023483|5.0|Great story!  Great characters!  The story of Katniss and Peeta shows the struggle against great odds.  Highly recommended for teens and adults!
B004WGIXX4|1.0|In addition to the Kutcher/Portman soft porn, there are a few other love stories developing.  I'm sure that you can guess how the main plot ends (they fall in love, they deny their love, they separate, they get back together).  Unfortunately, it's the other stories that are actually interesting but the movie only glosses over them as backdrops for this trite one.  I wish I could say at least that it was funny; alas, so much of the dialogue was cliché and generally predictable.<br /><br />I had this playing in the background on my iPad while I was looking for a book. Although my life wasn't totally wasted, if I had thought about it, I think I would have watched \\"Friday\\" or anything else instead.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Something's gone awry when the singles are the weakest tracks on the album. As weak as the singles are lyrically (\\"looks like a girl, but she's a flame\\" from the title track), they fit well in the musical landscape that Keys has painted. Easily the most consistent and cohesive set of songs we've heard from Keys, \\"Girl on Fire\\" moves effortlessly from piano ballads (\\"Brand New Me\\") to Jamie XX (\\"When It's All Over\\"), to synth-heavy groove \\"Listen to Your Heart\\". Some have lamented Keys' refusal to truly open up in the past, and they will likely find plenty wrong with another album where she keeps the listeners at arms length, mostly. But look harder at the thematic elements of a few tracks and you'll see that she's subtly addressing the things that have been said about her.  For example, \\"101\\" is a thinly veiled dig at the naysayers regarding her relationship with the notoriously unfaithful Swizz Beatz. Not to mention that it sounds fantastic. \\"Not Even The King\\", while certainly not currently personal for Keys, finds her at her most intimate on a recording, stopping to sit down, breathe, and push the pedal down before beginning the future nominee for Song of The Year at the Grammy Awards.<br /><br />I'm a longtime Alicia Keys fan, disappointed with the last album of mostly filler music, and am really thrilled to see Keys back at the top of her game and turning out an album even better than \\"As I Am\\". Great music!
6304698623|5.0|What Can I Say? I'm just a little girl at heart and although I bought this movie for my daughter it is by far (even over Gone w/the Wind, The Sound of Music & The Wizard of Oz) my all time, absolute favorite story and performance. It doesn't matter how many times I watch this story I cry at the same part over and over again. I guess the message just rings true no matter how old you get...and oh yeah, my daughters like it too!<br />Amazon is great at finding what you want for a great price.
B008ENA74E|2.0|Nothing too interesting.  No juicy stories, uninspired writing...mediocre at best.  It does give you some insight into the Investment Banking world, but would not recommend it.
B000I62JAK|1.0|I did not like this movie.  It plays to the lowest brain power of almost any movie I've seen.  No wonder the 18-25 yr.group is facing a bleak future.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I am enjoying watching this series. Each episode makes you want to watch the next one. The twists and turns are very good.
B005LAII0I|3.0|This movie was OK, not the greatest.  My general rule for a movie is that I stay awake during the whole time.  I drifted off about halfway through this one and never recovered.<br /><br />Ok, better for kids.
B005K01VZS|4.0|It wasn't as good as previous books by this author but worth the read.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Very enjoyable game.  Still trying to figure out how to change all the game setting as I completed all the easy tournament series.
0061726834|3.0|There are a lot of things I can say about Delirium as a novel.  (And there will be spoilers within this review of the text.  I would stop reading after the summary if you would like to be spared any secrets.)  It is a well-developed story that Lauren Oliver has clearly spent a lot of time on, planning it as a multiple-book storyline rather than just one story and pulling sequels out of thin air.  The author has spent a lot of time on the novel, and overall that shines through and lets the reader know that this is a novel that important time was spent on, it wasn't just written to get a book published.<br /> The story follows a young girl named Lena Haloway, who lives in a future America that has blocked off cities from each other and ruled Love out as a disease.  All people get cured of Love forever at the age of 18, when the immunization for Love will not harm them.  Lena is excited by the thought of getting this cure, as she has many secrets as to why she hates Love so much.  However, this all changes when she meets a boy named Alex.  Alex has a secret, and though they know that it is forbidden, Lena and Alex begin to talk more and more.<br /> While the story and the plot are decent, there is a reason that I only gave the story a three instead of a higher rating.  This novel does take a bit long to advance and get moving.  Sometimes this is appreciated in a story, though as a preference, I like my stories to start with a bit more action.  It took until about the first 100 pages for me to really get interested in the story, and appreciate Lena as a character.  Lena seems a bit dull at the beginning; she is not really driven by anything, except for the fact that she wants the cure really badly.  But this want for the cure is her only motivation until she meets a boy.  When she does meet this boy, she begins to think higher of herself.  I would not normally have a problem with this, as she suddenly finds a reason to be excited in a more than boring society, but the fact that she only starts to realize life after she meets the boy is a little nerve-wracking.  She also only finds herself beautiful after Alex tells her she is beautiful.  From all the times that she calls herself an \\"in-between\\" girl to the moment she calls herself beautiful, the only change is that Alex finds her beautiful.  This is not that good of a message to send to the young readers.<br /> Another flaw with the story, that is again a personal preference, is that Oliver uses an excessive amount of descriptive language, normally falling into the simile and metaphor area.  Every time Alex appears in the story, I do not need to know that his hair \\"is the color of autumn leaves,\\" as it has been mentioned several times before.  There were just many points in the novel that I felt the descriptive language was unnecessary, and wished to picture it in my own head, allowing my imagination to work, instead of having it all scripted out for me.  The story would have also started quicker, and been about 200 pages shorter if this had happened.<br /> Apart from these setbacks, the story was very good, and holds a lot of potential for the next books.  I look forward to seeing what happens to Lena and Alex, now that Oliver has left us with an enormous cliffhanger.  That is one very well done part of the story, is that Oliver left me craving to know what happens to our characters the moment the story ends.  It is something that I will have to look for in the bookstores to be able to know.  That is what sets this novel in my high opinion, is that with the problems I had with it, I want to know what happens anyway, and will most likely buy the next novels.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|I'll admit 'Brave' doesn't have quite the wall to wall boldness, rule-breaking and sheer brilliance of the very best<br />of Pixar's work, but I'll still take it over 95% of the Hollywood films I've seen this year. It never bored me, it made<br />me smile a lot, laugh a little, and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughter<br />relationships than most 'grown-up' films that try to deal with the subject.<br /><br />It also has a heroine who is a spunky, tough and first rate advocate for girl power, while still being heart-meltingly vulnerable<br />at just the right moments.<br /><br />It has tremendously talented voice actors in Billy Connolly, Kelly Maccdonald, and especially Emma Thompson.<br /><br />Most important, it has a twist half-way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction. I will admit, for the first<br />half I was a bit under-whelmed, The film seemed more Disney than Pixar,with 'safe' humor and ideas. Just a touch disappointingly predictable.<br />But then a witch gets involved in this medieval Scottish tale, and with a twist that's more Shakespearian comedy than Disney, suddenly this is<br />a new film we haven't seen before. The second half easily won me back over, and I was left feeling, as I always seem to be, that working<br />for Pixar must be just about the greatest job in movies.
B009CPES4I|4.0|A likable movie in the BBC tradition. It's funny, engaging, and moving.  And it has a a great cast.  Definitely worth seeing.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|This was the FAOTD sometime ago...  I &quot;bought&quot; it then, when it was free.  The game has never successfully completed the download on either of the two kindles that I've had since that time.  Every couple of weeks, I try again, but can never seem to get past 75-80% downloaded, and that takes FOREVER!  I've also tried at different locations, in case the wi-fi connection is suspect; it didn't seem to help. Currently, its been working at downloading this game for over an hour, and we're up to a whopping 4%. I've never seen a game app take so long to download.  Glad I didn't pay $5 for it, seeing as how I have never been able to actually play it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Classic Grisham! Definitely not as good as THE FIRM, but it was still so fun to get lost in . . . as many of Grisham's titles are. Glad I read it and would recommend do any Grisham fan or fan of courtroom dramas.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Is amazing. Ed Sheeran is an amazing artist in every way. After i bought this c.d I bought two concert tickets to his February st concert. I am very excited and can not wait. The cd came in very fast in perfect condition.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. Somehow it gets better every time! I can not wait to see the next movie! I feel like I can relate to katniss through her triumphs and failures. She reminds us that you must battle for the things you want most in life and for the ones you hold closest to you!
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked the Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy, you will like this also. It is hard to put down once you start reading it.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Great movie, filled with hope for those who may not have any.  I just wish it stuck to the real life story a bit more.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Having all of Alicia's previous cds, I was hoping that she would push the boundarires a bit more and try to have more upbeat and dance friendly songs much in the vein of \\"Butterflyz\\"(Roger's Release mix)\\" and \\"Troubles\\" (J-Jay & Chris Lum)<br />Unfortunately, there are far to many slow ballads which do not leave a lasting impact.<br /><br />\\"New Day\\" and \\"Girl On Fire\\" are very much the syle I was hoping to hear more of... although I wished the original version without Nickki's vocals were included and the \\"Inferno mix\\" as a bonus track. \\"Tears Always Win\\" has a refreshing vibe that harks back to 1950s do wop but with an updated today's sound. It is very much in the style of Bruno Mars who has been rumoured to have written the song.
1932100660|5.0|I REALLY didn't want to finish this book. I knew in my heart if I finished the book that I would feel obligated to make a life altering decision. You see, I've known for a long time that the principles discussed in this book were true. I lived on a Chinese diet for 2 years and I know I was healthier while I did it. I've known for a very long time that a diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, and grains, with meat eaten sparingly, was best for me. This book adds the weight of irrefutable scientific study to what I already knew but didn't have the discipline to live.<br />And I really don't trust science very much. Well, actually, I have no problem with the scientific method. I don't trust scientists whose findings support the special interests that fund them. And that covers 99% of the scientific findings that are presented before the general public. The second half of this book is devoted to demonstrating how special interests skew \\"science\\".<br />I believe Dr. Campbell because he stated what he found even when it was counter to the interests of those who funded him. I have done a cursory scan of the literature available on the Internet for refutations of Dr. Campbell's work and found only posturing, heated rhetoric, name-calling, and references to the kind of studies that are clearly biased in the interests of the funders. In other words, I found only the sort of thing that has destroyed my faith in scientists.<br />Now I'm obligated to make that life altering decision. The difficulty will lie in getting my wife and daughter to support me in that decision.
B004SBX112|2.0|While this is advertised as &#34;ad-free&#34;, it really isn't.  I love Angry Birds and right at the point that I was getting the perfect hit, an ad pops up.  I thought this was ad-free.  Oh well.  It's .99 so...
B003F3PMYI|5.0|As a personal development blogger, I've probably read close to 60 books on subjects like this over the last several years. I picked up this book after watching Shawn's TED Talk. This one of the first books I found so valuable that I felt compelled to leave a review. What I absolutely loved about this book was how the author tied theory to practical advice. Every concept is explained with research and examples. It's filled with easy exercises that be incorporated into your life in just minutes a day.
0143121006|2.0|A good friend chose \\"Midnight In Peking\\" for our book group to read, so I was compelled to finish it. It was a slow, arid slog from beginning to end. Paul French is a historian, and he writes like one; which is to say, he delivers information in a dry, expository style. There were a few instances when he tried to inject some personality into his prose (toward the end of the book, he writes,\\"When did she see the true nature of the men she was with? When had she clenched her fists with her thumbs inside, preparing to fight back? When did she scream out? When was the moment she knew she was going to die?\\") In contrast with the flat cadence of the rest of the book, this paragraph is almost absurdly florid.<br />We learn facts about the murder victim (She was blonde, she had been adopted as a baby, she had thick ankles, she had trouble getting along at school) but the author doesn't make us care about her. Similarly, her father, Werner, is portrayed as a less than likeable character whose doggedness in the search for his daughter's murderer made me feel more annoyance than compassion.<br />A good murder mystery needs tension and plot. Good historical literature needs compelling characters, or at least, well-crafted characterizations. Midnight in Peking had neither. What it did have was detailed descriptions of the locale, which was generally cold and wretched. All in all, a bit of a dud.

B0081JPTCQ|3.0|This app is so completely average that it's interchangeable with several other note taking apps. I've been trying to find the perfect app to take notes for class but so far the best choice has been Evernote. Hand-written notes were the reason I got this app but the functionality of that feature leaves much to be desired.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story and can not wait to read the second and third book. I love the main character and have to find out what happens to her!

034580404X|5.0|First off let me say the books came in mint condition! The print was perfect so no headaches or tiredness ...like THAT would even matter! I read the entire Trilogy in 3 days ...yep, a book a day! THAT is how amazing the story was. Some want to call it Mommy Porn ...others a frivolous housewife tale ...whatever! This is an amazing journey of 2 imperfect individuals that despite themselves, said \\"...ok, we'll give this relationship thing a  try\\" Yes, it sounds cliche, but heck if it isn't THE MOST exciting cliche! I'm in love with the story, I'm in love with the characters and can't wait for more books by Ms. E.L. James; Brava!

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I saw a lot of reviews for this game and I wasn't disapointed.  It has one of the best stories in game stories that I have ever seen.  playing through the puzzles over and over can feel a little repetitive but the story makes up for it.

1439156816|4.0|I always thought of Stephen King as just a horror story writer, but he does an excellent job with this how-to book.  He describes his own growing up time and how it helped with his writing.  Then he weaves personal anecdotes with how they help with writing.  It's not a perfect book in my estimation because there is a little more story than I would like, and not as much instruction as I would like, but overall it is a very enjoyable book and easy to read.  You also learn a lot about King.  It should be a very helpful guide for any writer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; the author had me hooked and I had to continue with book two of the series. E L James knows how to leave you hanging throughout all three books in her trilogy.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|No decent story line. I guess if you are looking for a book about a uni student that starts having kinky sex with a powerful controlling man and keeps on having kinky sex, then thinks about it a lot and then has some more kinky sex....and your happy with that and that's all, then you may enjoy this book.
0880790121|3.0|The drawings are interesting and very elaborate.  I took the time to trim the edges of this deck as the white border took away from the images contained within.  I think I will used it more because of the trimming party.  I am not a huge fan of this deck but can appreciate its 'grooviness.'  If you can find one used or at a discount, not a bad one to own.  The backs of each card is NOT reversible.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I played the original version of Mahjong for years and now the Deluxe HD game is even more enjoyable. A daily dose is good for me.
B008Y1YJZY|2.0|I was really looking forward to this film after seeing the trailer. Now I've seen it, and it was just meh. I guess I'm in the minority.<br /><br />The beginning wasn't bad, but soon the story began unraveling. The whole sleigh ride to try to get to Gwen's house (the bulk of the film) was just one unfunny screw-up after another, including a \\"joke\\" showing a dog mounting a fluffy slipper. I don't mind adult-oriented jokes in children's films, but they at least need to be tasteful and funny! The worst was the reindeer getting hurt and lost during this whole mess, with no explanation as to their fate until the very end of the film. How could Santa (grandpa) leave his reindeer behind like they were disposable??! The UFO tangent was just plain stupid, with the end result being the sleigh gets blown to bits by the military. There were so many moments like that in the film that just took away from the story, without adding anything of substance or relevance. There was nothing gracious or magical to find here, like in the old Christmas classics provided by Rankin-Bass, where the story was clear and endearing, and at a pace that didn't make your head spin.<br /><br />I'd say buy an old Rankin-Bass classic instead, or Polar Express, or the Muppet Christmas Carol.
B008U6QANC|3.0|After waiting for years for a new album, La Futura should have been special! But instead, it sounded like three very good musicians yawning their way thru shelved studio takes. &#34; I gotsta get paid &#34; should have been titled &#34; 25 Lighters&#34;, not worthy of borrowing (title-wise) from &#34; Just got paid&#34;. &#34;Chartreuse&#34; was a decent boogie number and &#34;Consumption&#34; was your typical alcohol storyline rocker. &#34;Over you&#34; might have been the best track on the LP, quite bluesy and borders on great! &#34;Heartache in blue&#34; was early-sounding ZZ, with good Harp playing. &#34;I don't wanna lose,lose you&#34; was ok, but not worthy of ZZ. &#34;Flyin high&#34; never should have been allowed to be heard, garage bands could do better than this! &#34;Big shiny nine&#34; was close to great, I thought it was the best rocker of the LP! &#34;Have a little mercy&#34;, another song where ZZ borrows from it's title past was lacking on a foundation, yawning again through this cut. ZZ seemed to not know how to end a lot of these songs's, they either ended abruptly or went to engineer heaven! Anyone buying this LP, be advised, it's in 45rpm mode, I guess that's so they can stretch it to two LP's! Like I said, this should have been a monumental LP but wasn't, and I've been a fan of ZZ since they began and I know they can do much better than this effort!!

0385335997|4.0|Voyager picks up where Dragonfly in Amber left off still 20 years later since Outlander. At times, I got frustrated with the author for some of the writing because of the pacing and few grammar errors. I stilled loved the book inspite of this. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Claire always believed that Jamie died at Culloden but in truth he did not he lived. Claire along with Brianna and Roger continue to search for Jamie's whereabouts in Scotland. They come up with a few clues to Jamie's whereabouts. They find Jamie to be living in Edinburgh as Alex Malcolm. Claire takes care of her affairs in Boston before making return trip back thru the stones. She's not sure of her reception she'll receive from Jamie yet knows that she must go anyway. Needless to say that Jamie is stunned by Claire's sudden appearance and delighted as well because he never expected to see her again after sending her thru the stones. Jamie wants to know everything about Claire and the baby. He is moved beyond words that Claire brings proof of Brianna's existence in pictures which he treasures immediately. Jamie and Claire both fall into a pattern of existence like no time has passed at all for either of them. Claire is thrilled to see Fergus again. She's not so sure  about Mr. Willoughby but trusted Jamie's judgement on the matter. Jamie was a smuggler and seditionist writer to help support Jenny and family in Lallybroch in his position as printer. Both Jamie and Claire hid parts of themselves from each other which left hurt feelings and misunderstanding for the both of them. When young Ian Murray is kidnapped by pirates when trying to retrieve a treasure to help pay costs in a personal matter for Jamie. Claire and Jamie set sail after him towards Jamaica to retrieve young Ian. What is in store for Jamie and Claire? Will they be able to retrieve young Ian? What is next for Jamie and Claire? Your answers await you in Voyager.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to admit, halfway through first book I was kinda tired of the explicit sex--which is weird coming from me--but then the story kicked in.  For those who don't know, there is definitely a GREAT story in this book.  Still don't see how they are going to do a movie!

1569242739|5.0|I absolutely love this cookbook! I've had it for several years now and use it all of the time! I catered my sister's wedding (all vegan dessert reception, yum!) and I made about 6 different types of cupcakes and 7 frostings/ toppings from this book (along with tons of cookies/ brownies/ etc. from 'Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar'). Everything went over fantastically! The most-requested cupcake in this book is the red velvet but my favorite is the cherry chocolate one!<br /><br />Buy this, it's amazing!

1455527475|2.0|My AMAZON purchased volume of Greg Smith's intense 1,500 word resignation letter that was published in the Op-Ed section of the March - 2012 New York Times left me cold.  His first book, \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs\\", was published in September of 2012.  This suggests to me that the book was well into editing at the time of the editorial!<br /><br />Mixed between kudos for Brooks Brothers, Krispy Kremes, a love affair, training and other minutiae is scant detail of any of the sordid schemes, or the mechanics of financial instruments that decimated our economy (not their profits though).  A most interesting fact is that the Op-Ed itself did not appear in the the 250 page plus book?<br /><br />I'll give it 2 stars since I finished reading the book.  However, my advice is for you to archive the NYT for a read of the Op-Ed itself; it says more and will save you a great deal of time.

0061474355|5.0|There is something about this universe that draws you in and makes you want to know more. I love all of the symbolism in the bells and the gates in the river of death. I love all the action and adventure, you really feel like you're experiencing it for yourself. Most of all, I love these characters! They are relatable, deep, and interesting. There's not much I've read that I consider to be equal to the balance of fun, fantasy and incredible story Harry Potter has, but this fits the bill all day long. The only thing I don't like about the whole series is how there's not MORE!
1400069289|5.0|Seller AMAZON'S book Habit by Charles Duhigg is a winner.  The book escalates Psych 101's - Stimulus, Action, Reward syndrome with a multitude of interesting factual case studies.  A well written insight into a wide berth of objectives; corporate, non-profits, health, public safety, sports etc..<br /><br />This book is an easily digested, fun read. The book is endowed with a wealth of learning.  Highly recommended to all, especially those espoused to creating positive attitudes in group dynamics,  The book is a definite keeper.

0547884591|3.0|It is probably not prudent or common to write a review about a book that one have not read. However, I have read the entire kindle sample and can safely say that I do not need to read any further. Why?<br /><br />i) Firstly, the book does not have a central theme to it. I have been following Tim for about 4 years now and have read his take on learning languages etc. from his blog. I don't need to read that in this book.<br /><br />ii) Secondly, from the sample, the writing was choppy. While certain readers may prefer it that way, I see it as a lack of effort from the author's part to provide a coherent reading experience.<br /><br />iii) Thirdly, I can't stand the comparison to \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle maintenance.\\" While the comparison is clever, it does not make any sense because while one is a philosophical part-biography the other is wannabe instruction manual without a theme.<br /><br />So, I will pass on this one. Thanks.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Fiio E6 arrived dead on arrival.  Only worked if the amp was plugged in. Charged for hours but the moment I unplug it, it's dead. Googled the issue apparently I am not the only one. Google 'Red light flickering E6' and you'll find a few threads. Also, there are many 'fake' E6's out there. Not sure if mine was fake. Bought from seller 'Head-Direct' so beware.  Amazon is awesome, giving me a full refund.

So i decided to give the book a try and felt like I was reading the movie. They go hand in hand with eachother. Chuck's writimg is always unique from book to book, but Fight Club was by far my favorite.

0061474355|5.0|I love this book. The magic system is so unique and clever. At first, I was very confused as to what is going on, but that's part of the magic of the book. There's so much that even Sabriel doesn't know and we get to learn along with her. The love story with her and Touchstone is subtle, but wonderful. And Mogget is perhaps one of the greatest characters ever written. He's sarcastic and so cat-ish.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite books of all time. I will read it over and over. And this version is wonderful. The cover is soft and feels good to hold.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love all 3 Books :) they are very entertaining  and interesting  .  I really enjoyed the loved triangle as well
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Honestly, this is the best 99 cent book I've ever read.  I'd have been happy if I spent 7.99.<br /><br />The book is well written, and you feel like you are on the surface of Mars.  It's hilarious, yet full of suspense.  The technical details do not overwhelm, but you'll appreciate that geeks exist in the future.  The Elrond reference had me rolling.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  It deserves to be a best seller!
B000059MEK|5.0|Get the DVD &#34;Daft Punk - Interstella 5555&#34;.  It was made from this soundtrack.<br /><br />Potentially the best album released by Daft Punk.  This will get you in to their music and can be listened to over and over.

B00886XQO0|1.0|I have the Turtle Beach Wireless X41's. They are perfect but I though it was time to upgrade and this was it! However when I received them I noticed they felt cheap; noticeably cheaper than the x41. I thought maybe it just seems that way and carried on. I put them on my head and noticed they are not at all ergonomic in comparison to the X41, but still I thought that is okay because the features! Bluetooth phone calls and music will be great, right? WRONG! Right out of the box they were broken. They simply did not work (no it was not a battery problem). I suppose I should have expected this right when I took them out from the box because although they look REALLY cool with the orange stitching they just feel cheap. I am returning and no I am not replacing. Clearly there are quality control problems here. Look elsewhere for quality headphones in the $300 price range because these are not. Amazon as always great service but if this is turtle beach's latest and greatest (supposedly it is) then it's time  for me to find another manufacturer because they've lost their way. I had another TB headset years ago way before x41 and those were quality. Priorities have changed at TB headquarters.
1449410243|5.0|I'm not going to eview the content, nearly all of it is available on the Oatmeal's website.  It is good content, check it out.<br /><br />There are exclusive comics in here, which I greatly enjoyed.<br /><br />The pull out poster ACTUALLY allows you to unfold it without having to detach it!  That is so very awesome for my need to keep things in &#34;New&#34; condition.  All products with an attached poster (magazine, game guide, book) need this feature.<br /><br />Get this book if you enjoy the Oatmeal's humor.

B008Y5OWSO|5.0|It appears that people are coming around to the conclusion that \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is not the worst film ever made. So what I want to concentrate are a few reasons why it got that reputation in the first place.<br />Let's start with the money. It's true that Cimino shot the budget to pieces on this film. In the director's defense I suspect that he would argue that it's all up there on the screen. But this type of spending will generate animosity on the part of both studio executives and film critics. It's happened before, notably when Brando was roasted for \\"One-Eyed Jacks.\\" So to some extent the film was being willed to fail. People were incensed that Cimino spent United Artists into a hole and was quite unapologetic about it.<br />Now let's look at the politics. \\"Heaven's Gate\\" came out during Ronald Reagan's first term in office. The political Right was ascendant and the message of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" was not the message that they wanted to hear. They were more in tune with the message of Owen Wister's novel The Virginian, namely that property was sacred and a rich man's cow was worth more than a poor man's life. I suspect that with the Occupy Movement and the talk about \\"the 99%\\" more people would be in tune with the film's depiction of The Rich as heartless, self-serving bastards than they would have been in 1980.<br />Lastly, let's look at the film itself. One reviewer compared the film to \\"The Leopard,\\" \\"1900\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time in America.\\" this was quite telling. None of these film was a smash with the American movie-going public when they premiered. And the Leone's film suffered a fate similar to Cimino's in that it was edited into incoherency by a studio desperate to salvage something from the ruins. The moral seems to be that American audiences don't like to sit through really long films. Now, is it true that in the heyday of Hollywood, M.G.M. could have done the same story with Robert Taylor and Robert Walker and brought it in at under two hours? Absolutely. But it wouldn't have been the same film. And that's my final point. Cimino was the storyteller and he had to tell the story his way. When the film first came out, I remember a critic of repute (it may have been Pauline Kael or Judith Crist) remarking that while it was easy to see what could have been cut from the film, the difficult part was deciding what should remain. (I assume that she was seeing the uncut version.) I would respond that Cimino needed to take all that time depicting James Averill's graduation day at Harvard because Averill would later remark that it was the best day of his life. It was necessary to film the aging Joseph Cotten delivering his exhortation to the graduating class because they clearly regarded it as hot air, and had no intention of living up to its demands. It was necessay to film John Hurt's clownish, preening response because Hurt was the kind of guy who would wind up out in Wyoming, killing immigrants who had the temerity to rustle cattle from their betters. I simply can not see the wisdom of denying Cimino his way of telling the story which, incidentally, was identical to the method he used in \\"The Deer Hunter\\"--a film for which he was praised to the skies and declared to be a new director of genius.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Freaking Anime and Daft Punk had a baby.  All the music is from the album &#34;Discovery&#34;.  I never realized how perfect it all goes togethor.<br /><br />Great for anyone to watch.  No language barriers, minimal violence (action scenes yes), and wonderful bright colors with imaginative dreamlike qualities.<br /><br />I made a few music-nerd friends watch it and they were quite impressed!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love the outdoors, but I cannot imagine doing this.  I am 73 years old and feel sustained by my cycling and daily training.  I heard Cherlyl on public radio and planned on buying the book. A neighbor told me about this wonderful book she just finished so I bought it for my daughter also.  It seems that everyone is reading this book.
0345529057|5.0|A great deal for all four of these books; I've seen the single books sell for as much. Plus, the smaller paperback version is easier to carry around. I encourage any fiction love to get into this series- you will need the four book set because you won't be able to put them down.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I started out with John's 1987 album &#34;Bring the Family&#34; and have bought everything since. There have only been a couple of albums that were a little weak. This is another great one - great lyrics of course, always great musicians and cleanly crafted performances. Honest and gritty doesn't have to sound raggedy. Hiatt has a number of modes his songs follow, so album to album there are similar types of songs, but a lot of variety, some serious, and always some great subtle humor. He's a great song writer and must surely love his work to this day as this collection of songs adds another to the pile of excellent albums he's put out. I think he's pretty amazing. If you're not familiar with John Hiatt you might need to listen a bit for him to grab you. That was true for me. He runs the gammut from folky to blues to a kind of rock-a-billy style.... a lot of fun.
B008KW43TE|5.0|This is an awesome debut album. I listened to the entire thing through without skipping a song. It has so much soul...Very good Mr Ocean, very good.

B0086449YA|5.0|I'm a big Mark Knophler fan and routinely buy each album he makes. This is a two disk set with one being a bit more quiet, the other more rocky - bluesy. Mark has his various styles of songs that crop up on every album, and this album seems a little less structured thematically, compared to others. At first listen it seemed a little more subtle, more becoming apparent in repeated listening - I usually think that's an indication of  really good stuff.  Considering the album is called &#34;Privateering&#34; it may have been intended to be a bit looser and easy-going. I love it - I'm never disappointed - just amazed that such a musician can be so talented and prolific, yet running a bit out of the mainstream. He's still got the &#34;Dire Straits&#34; licks but has a much more varied repetoire. Still, I must admit to loving it when he rocks out. What a great unique style of playing! As usual, some tunes have a Celtic flavor (not frenetic Celtic) with awesome session players and some dynamic building riffs, some bluesy numbers, some rocky, some rock-a-billy, interesting thoughtful lyrics and themes, and some good subtle humor. Honest unpretentious beautifully performed music.
0316228532|3.0|.. Maybe the next non-Harry Potter novel will be good. I neither expected, nor wanted, the book to be just like her kid wizard series, but I found it a really difficult slog. I only pushed through to the end due to the strong critical reviews, and I only give it three stars out of respect to her intentions.<br />  Honestly? I think J.K. is a very rich woman who really does care about the disadvantaged and wanted to use her considerable gifts to get the rest of society to pay attention to those we walk right by -- who simply may expire from our negligence. That seems to be the main message of the book, and certainly what propels the final tragedy.<br />  Even three quarters into the book, I could not remember which character was which. They all seemed so petty and disgruntled and completely un-self-aware.<br />  I feel nothing but relief that I have finished this. And that makes me sad. On the other hand, I paid full price for the hardcover I bought in an airport bookstore before a long flight, and it seems likely that she'll give some portion of that money to her charity for underprivileged kids, Lumos. So, not a total waste.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I always look forward to Kathy Reich's next book and this one doesn't disappoint. I enjoyed learning about a part of my country that I know very little about...the north and an industry...diamond mining ...that I had no idea was so developed in that part of Canada.<br />Sometimes the medical detail slowed down the story as happens with her stories but it was not enough to keep me from enjoying the story which twisted and turned to an unexpected ending.

1451627297|5.0|There's something to be said for storytelling, for the power of narrative that makes a reader forget the outside world and immerse into the world of the author.  Stephen King may not win the biggest literary awards, but when it comes to mesmerizing storytelling, he truly is the KING.<br /><br />The plot centers around an English teacher named Jake Epping, who is shown a fissure in time that allows him to travel to 1958 and back.  He can stay in the past as long as he wants yet the elapsed time when he returns is only two minutes.  In his first two journeys, he attempts to change history by taking out the ruthless father of one of his students, a man who killed his wife and other children with a sledgehammer years ago.  In his third trip, he takes on a much more far-reaching mission:  to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from murdering JFK.  While doing so, an unexpected complication arises:  Jake falls deeply in love with a woman named Sadie Dunhill.<br /><br />To embrace this story, the reader must buy into several of King's truths.  The first:  always keep it simple.  Stephen King wastes no time in describing the physics of time travel.  Jake's friend's storeroom is a portal to the past and you either buy in - or not.  Smart move, Mr. King.<br /><br />The second is that the past is obdurate.  The past totally resists change and the bigger the change, the more obdurate the past will be.  It's also harmonious and filled with parallels and coincidences.  Again, Stephen King offers a take-it-or-leave-it choice:  you must believe in the harmony of the \\"Land of Ago\\" -- or not.<br /><br />And third, you must believe in the chaos theory (if a butterfly flaps its wings, there may be a storm in the Amazon many years later). In other words, small actions may have extremely complex and far-reaching effects.  Stephen King takes his time developing this one; in fact, it almost seems as if he is going to advance the theory and then ignore it entirely.  But wait.  He isn't the KING for nothing.<br /><br />It's important to note that although the title is 11/22/63, the Kennedy-Oswald story does not take center stage until about half-way through the book.  Up until then, the reader gets to enjoy Stephen King's massive research into the 50s - the simpler, friendlier lives interspersed with deep and hurtful prejudices.  Everything from the songs on the radio to household products and budding technology are brought into play, and Mr. King does a masterful job of making the past come alive.<br /><br />At that point, Mr. King switches to the Oswald story. The only disappointment is that he (unlike his wife Tabitha) believes in the single assassin theory; my own reading informs me that CIA renegades were likely involved.  Personal beliefs aside, Stephen King does an extremely credible job of bringing Lee Oswald and Jake Epping together.<br /><br />The ending may not be everybody's cup of tea but it was mine;  I found it to be creative and unexpected and it gave me new respect for this author.  Although this is not a perfect novel - some of the beat-the-clock action and melodramatic touches occasionally were over the top - this is an absolutely page-turning book.  Once I started, time stood still and all I wanted to do was find out what happens next. \\"The multiple choices and possibilities of daily life are the music we dance to,\\" writes Mr. King.  Indeed, the music lingers even after the last page.othing.<br /><br />It's important to note that although the title is 11/22/63, the Kennedy-Oswald story does not take center stage until about half-way through the book.

B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. Its funny, its got some action, its dark, it has a bit of romance, and, most importantly, Emma Stone.

Zombie fans like it, non-zombie fans like it, and its really funny. Great film, worth a watch!
B007EECSFA|5.0|In 1961, at a family birthday party, sixteen year old Laurel witnesses a strange encounter between a man and her mother, Dorothy, that will become a heavy secret for years and years. Fast forward to 2011 when Laurel comes home to visit her dying mother. Finding an old photo from 1941 and listening to her mother's ramblings become clues to a mystery from her mother's past that Laurel feels compelled to solve.<br /><br />\\"It suddenly seemed to Laurel that all the absence in her own life, every loss and sadness, every unexplained melancholy, took the shadowy form of the same unanswered question:something that had been there since she was sixteen years old-- her mother's unspoken secret.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who are you, Dorothy?\\" she said beneath her breath, \\"Who were you, before you became Ma?\\"<br /><br />The plot segues seamlessly between 1941, 1961 and 2011 as told alternately by Laurel and Dorothy. Never once did I feel like I was yanked out of one timeframe and abruptly thrust into another. Morton's writing is smooth as silk and just as luxurious. I've read reviews that say she is a little wordy. I disagree. I love the way she puts me in the scene and makes me aware of all the surroundings.<br /><br /> Morton has the ability to draw me into her world immediately and keeps my interest in the plot and characters invested at all times. In every one of her books there has been a \\"twist\\" that I didn't see coming. I've now read every book Kate Morton has written and loved them all. The Secret Keeper is my second favorite one just a shade behind The Distant Hours, most likely my favorite read of 2012. 4.5****<br /><br />Disclosure: A review copy of the book was provided by Netgalley/Atria  in exchange for my honest opinion.

0385341008|5.0|Reading this book was like watching a rose bloom. It sat on my shelf for years before I finally opened it, prepared to muddle through a technically well written but tedious story. NOT so! There is no BANG, BOOM, or POW, but this is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. The characters are a joy getting to know as bits and pieces of their very real personalities are revealed. Normally I find stories in the format of letters, frequent changing of point of view, etc. to be very confusing and distasteful, but this book was done in a very clean, neat, and organized fashion so that there was no confusion or bewilderment. I am calling this story one that every writer should read. It's brilliant.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|Wagner's operas &#34;the Ring Cycle&#34; produced by the Met is exceptionally great!  The company that produced the DVD's of the live production did a fine job, with one exception.  All five DVD's offer subtitles in different languages, otherwise enjoyment of the performances is greatly diminished, bcause you don't know what the performers are saying.  Four of the five DVDs have this available.  One of them was produced erroneously, because the only subtitle available is in German.  Deutchegrammaphone, who produced the DVDs, must have made this same error on the entire production run, because the replacement set you sent me had the same error.  It is on the DVD titled &#34;Gotterdamerung&#34;.  Perhaps you could inform them of this error and they can fix it.  Then you can send me that corrected version.  I, and all of their thousands of other customers would be very grateful.<br />Thank you.<br />Bill Conlin

0547884591|5.0|Having read Tim's other books I find this one almost predictable in style, but richer in content. Tim speaks always from the authority<br />of a user and never down his nose to would be users. His self deprecating style is comfortable and meaningful. I found his tips and insight to be worthy and useful. This is a reference piece and the best take away is in the beginning, setting the learning stage. Paraphrased; Learn one or two recipes that you have stone cold mastery of and you can always have your guests hearts. That applies to so much in our hurried lives. We have all become wide ranging generalists, and knowing more about less is sometimes comforting and welcome. Read on friend, this is one you won't want to miss or collect. Cheers!

1611761069|1.0|I became a Patricia Cornwell fan after listening to her first book. However her last few books have been a tough listen. The narrator sounds angry all the time. She reads it in such a way that it's just not a fun listen. Also, instead of continuing to develop the Marino character as a curmudgeon who is lovable she has turned him into a man to be loathed. Scarpetta seems to just tolerate him. The narrator makes it even worse. The disdain and disgust in her voice when she is reading the Marino part makes me angry at her.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|I've been a huge KISS fan for a long time. One of my earliest memories is going through the Alive II pictures on the vinyl record. My dad was a member of the KISS Army back in the 70's and I've been a proud member for 5 years. When Sonic Boom came out, I was really excited; I listened to it non-stop for a couple of weeks and thought it was really good. Unfortunately the feeling only lasted those couple of weeks. Sonic Boom dropped under the Equator on my list of favourite KISS albums. When Monster was announced, I was fearful for another Sonic Boom. I believed the \\"new guys\\" (specially Tommy Thayer) didn't have it in them to be in KISS.<br />October 9th came and Monster blew my mind away. It changed my opinion of these guys. I can finally give them the credit and respect they deserve and consider them an important part of KISStory.<br />But let's get to the album: Monster is a GREAT rock album. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley haven't sounded this good in a LONG time and they've definitely improved their song writing skills (listen to \\"Long Way Down\\" for example). You'll get the same ol' sex, money, party lyrics that makes KISS KISS but also lyrics on failure, identity and going back to your roots (courtesy of Mr. Thayer). Musically, the album is indeed a Wall of Sound: you get strong catchy guitar riffs, heavy drumming, screams, a cappella singing and harmony. You can FEEL these guys are very comfortable playing together and that they've had fun recording this album. The one song in there that I considered a filler was Thayer's \\"Outta This World\\". I thought it was another Frehley wannabe song and kinda killed the whole mood of the album. Not anymore. The song has grown on me and is a HUGE improvement from \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" in Sonic Boom (I still think Tommy should move away from the cliche Spaceman space/ rocket/ universe/stars lyrics). From the rest I can't complain. It's great. Gene's vocals on \\"Take Me Down Below\\" remind me of his 70's-80's sound and Paul'svoice has acquired a raspier feel to it.<br />Unfortunately this is due to him loosing his voice. If you get to listen to them live, he can't sing anymore. I really hope it's because he hasn't stopped since mid 2012 and has been on constant touring and recording. I really hope this end of year break helps his voice recover. Eric Singer is probably a Peter Criss / Eric Carr hybrid with the rhythm and heavy drumming in his technique.<br />I really recommend this album, hands down. I can definitely say it's in my top 5 KISS albums EVER, and THAT says a lot. This is old school KISS with a modern twist to it and I love it. My recommendation: listing to it with the volume to the max, and get blown away by this Wall of Sound.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you are looking for an author that considers every detail this is the book for you. Though the story may be hard to get into at first it is well worth it in the end. With the chapters being short it is very easy to get caught up in the book and forget about time and where you are.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am a weather junkie and this software feeds my addiction.  It gives a lot of detail right down to hourly forecasts.

0061474355|5.0|This book sparked a fever, one of magic and adventure and excitement.  The first of a trilogy about the Old Kingdom, \\"Sabriel\\" begins the journey from a modern world of technology and government to an old one of magic and mystery.  While both show signs of corruption, in the Old Kingdom Sabriel's path is set for her, a quest to put the Kingdom to rights and save those who are loved by her, one that must end either in death or in success.  Garth Nix weaves a powerful story, balancing between the two worlds and telling detailed stories, giving the reader tidbits of information along the way to fill in the holes while still maintaining suspense.  The end of this book is not the end at all, but merely one chapter completed, leaving the reader eager for more.<br /><br />Suitable for a wide range of ages, I have recommended this book to the parents of young teens asking for something to read that is \\"age appropriate\\" yet intriguing.  This is most certainly not a book that will be consumed in an hour and then forgotten.  It is easy to become lost in the world of magic Nix creates, but it is an adventure that you will not regret embarking upon; rather, it is one that you will choose to take again and again.  I don't know how many times I have read this and the sequels, but they will never grow old.

0140157352|4.0|This is a book that I was required to read as requirement for a college business course, not only does it have tips and guidelines for negotiation in the professional world but great for everyday battles.  I recommend it to all age groups although it can be slightly wordy at times.  Fisher and Ury bring up manny outlooks that changed how I saw negotiation and conflict, as well as mutual gains instead of compromise this along with building or maintaining relationships are the most promenade themes of the book.  The authors stress that you must respect the one that you are negotiating with because most of the time you would like to have a healthy relationship for future negotiations or family, business, ext.  Over all I gave this book a 4 out 5 stars because I had great tips and theory but in my opinion it seems that it will only be helpful if both sides are using them.  Hopefully I am proven wrong the next time I am negotiating!

1439152802|4.0|Laural is sixteen when she witnesses a crime at her home that changes her life forever. It's a secret that she has kept until now. But now in her 60s and watching her mother slowly slipping away, she feels the burning need to fit all of the pieces of the puzzle together. Alternating between now and 50 years ago the story of the secret is told and everything Laural thought she knew about her mother is changed.<br /><br />I had previously read The House at Riverton and enjoyed it. So I was excited to get this book for review. The secret is revealed in the very beginning of the book, or so I thought. Because the story keeps jumping back and forth between the now and then it can become a bit bogged down in the middle. But keep reading. The story not only picks up, but you'll find out even more secrets until the very last secret is revealed at the end. The storyline is intriguing, but the history that is intermingled with the story is engaging and captivating as well. Definitely a book worth reading.<br /><br />I received this book free of charge from Newman Communications in exchange for my honest review.
B000LJAEFG|5.0|really loved the movie way back when and thought it would be interesting to see it again.  Was exactly what I expected.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|What  can i say if you are a  true fan from the Buffalo Springfield-CSNY-T-R.........The HORSE........It's a fantastic work...The history and people involved in the music connected with this CD ......  Just Fantastic.....Thank You ...Oh ant the Book Waging Heavy Peace...GREAT....
B0015DROBO|4.0|If it were not for the slow start, I would have given it a 5 star rating.  I choose this book because of the movie advertising trailers.  I like mysteries with complicated plots and &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; is one of those stories.  The book actually has several plots and none were apparent until the end.
B000W746GK|5.0|loved the series and was working on completing my set.  great movie to watch.  was everything I hoped it was to be
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Mr. Dylan not much to say  it's Bob Dylan doing what Bob Dylan Does .....I think it's great........Dylan Fans should like it a lot........I like it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The premise of the main character being in prison originally was a turn off.  But the book grows on you as the plot twists and turns keeping the reader on edge. This book certainly lives up to John Grisham's reputation as an excellent story teller.
1451626657|5.0|For decades all I knew about Catch-22 was that it was about war, and for that reason, never wanted to read it. Last week I finally picked it up, and what I thought would be the standard war story was anything but.<br /><br />Centering around Yossarian, the bombardier afraid of dying, the novel circles through events, showing them from different characters' perspectives at different times. Joseph Heller masterfully takes the reader in and out of the minds of the large cast of characters, back and forth in time seamlessly.<br /><br />The book is raw, horrifying, infuriating, sarcastic, and surprisingly funny, depicting the insanity of war (or really of any enterprise) conducted by a mindless bureaucracy. Not a light read, not the kind of book I would ordinarily read but one I highly recommend because of the brilliance and depth of the writing.
B001706I5I|1.0|I thought it was terrible. I love the older animated version. I thought a lot of the humor was inappropriate. I'm not a prude, but thought this movie could have been much better. I expected more from Ron Howard.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I finished the book.  It is not a bad book or a good book.  Having main character that are so weird is a turnoff.  I guessed at what was going to happen before it really did.  I liked to be surprised.  Also, I like to root for the main characters.  In this book they were not particularly likeable.  The story in the beginning sucks one in.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|I think that Glee is the best TV show on the whole wide planet. Only high-quality shows like The Jerry Springer Show and Jac/k/a/s/s come even close to beating the grandeur and spectacle that is Glee. With that in mind, I also believe that Glee is one hell of a very original TV show, especially with all of its covers of songs by musicians who actually have talent and can compose their own pieces of music! In addition, Glee, as we all know and testify, if full of ultra-talented actors who also double as singers who are better than 99.9% of all the musicians who only sing and play instruments! This is easily proven by the Glee cast's murderous overuse of autotune, endless vocal overdubbing and, naturally, lip synching galore. With this in mind, I was just a-jumping out of my socks to get my hands on this album, and I don't regret it one iota!<br /><br />If there is one complaint I have about the whole music industry--in addition to the fact that we music fans are stabbing the musicians in the back by buying fewer copies of their albums than ever--it is that there are not enough actor-singers who just do covers of other singer's songs! This is an outrage that I hope will be rectified now that our lord and savior, Obama, finally got reelected. That's why I love listening to this CD--because everything is highly original and unique, to the point where you ask yourself, \\"Man alive, can the Glee cast get even better at just s/t/e/a/ling other artist's songs?\\"<br /><br />My favorite Glee original composition is Gangbang style because it was Psy who came up with it. This shows that the Glee \\"kids\\" are very sophisticated as singers and composers. Another winning original composition here is Mine because Taylor Swift initially sang it first. Finally, my other favorite is The Scientist since it is a unique, never-been-done song that was originally composed and sung by Coldplay.<br /><br />Cutting straight to the chase: Please purchase this Glee CD. You will not regret it because, after all, Mitt Romney lost the election, which means that you will have more money in your pocket now to afford this CD, what with Obama raising the unemployment rate and extending unemployment benefits indefinitely!e, after all, Mitt Romney lost the election, which means that you will have more money in your pocket now to afford this CD, what with Obama raising the unemployment rate and extending unemployment benefits indefinitely!
B009K0P10K|4.0|I like the new season, but I thought season 1 was a little better and more stream-lined.  Still worth watching.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|helps a lot with complex equations. I would love this app on my phone.  It rocks.  yay for calculator plus free.
B0091LS07E|5.0|My reaction was \\"Oooooo, giiiiirrrrrl!\\" when I heard that Alicia would be putting out another album today! Am I really the only person on God's green Earth who does not believe that she has not yet won enough Grammys?! She's only won 14 at this point in her career, but why has she not won 18 or maybe even 19? I mean, after all, Barack Obama is the president now anyway, right, playas?! Right! I think that race may have played a factor in that!!<br /><br />But anyhoo, I am overjoyed that Alicia released this album because I think the world is ready for it more than ever now. I don't want to seem presumptuous here, but I think I'm her biggest fan...easily! I know all of her songs better than I do the back of my hand, and I have a lot of experience with the back of my hand, lemme tell ya. It's hard for me to pick just one awesome song on Girl on Fire because they are all top-notch. I love The Boy is Mine, which I believe is the best song on this CD. Then again, Alicia is soooo unbelievably talented and goddess-like that I may reconsider and instead choose Naughty Girl, which, correct me if I am wrong, is track number 7 here (or something close to that number). You know what, I'll change my mind again and instead say that I'm Every Woman is the best song on this CD. Yeah, you know what? I'm sticking to that choice, girlfriend.<br /><br />I think that Girl on Fire is a sumptuous example of what Alicia is capable of. I think it perfectly demonstrates her talents as a rapper along the likes of Missy Elliot and Lil' Kim. And to that, I say, \\"Holla!\\" Hold on, just a second, though. Actually, I just changed my mind...yes...yup, I did just change my mind. I think that \\"Oooooooo, giiiiiirrrrrrrl!\\" better captures how this CD makes me feel. Go out and buy it, even though unemployment is expected to worsen under Obama.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got this so that I could have the whole series on my kindle and I read through the whole series twice. These books know how to pull you into a world that is completely different than our's. I truly found this book great, but I have to admit that my favorite book from this series is Mockingjay.
B004478GN8|4.0|This is very easy to build, so you can leave even a 5 year old to build it himself, and good fun in terms of building up your set of star wars minifigs.  They are not really popular characters (and probably not a must have unless a die hard star wars fan) so they tend to be played with as clone troopers.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Very entertaining movie...lots of action, humor and good fun. . If your into this type of movie, this is the one to watch1
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|the best hidden object game hands down! The makers really put the extra effort in would have easily payed more!! Gameplay is long but not dragged out and is probably as realistic as any hidden object game can get. cannot wait for the continuation!!! Thank you creators!
B00005214X|4.0|I am a George Harrison fan and have really enjoyed this All Things Must Pass Boxed Edition set of CDs.
B009FOBMBI|3.0|This is a good album over-all.  I didn't think it was as good as the previous 2 albums but overall a good listen.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|what can I say its very funny I laughted threw the hole movie my family it.  I love it I can watch it over and over again.
B000EGF0NW|4.0|purchased this memoir for my daughter for school; she has to read this for one of her classes; said it was good
B002YK8OKC|5.0|It's a classic!  HD really makes this movie awesome!  Every family should have a copy of this movie in their home or on their electronic device!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie was a great on my grand children said Grandma you brought my favior movie, I love you so much we also watch this movie almost every weekend, We have ever friday threw Saturday movies night with the family, that we dont go to the movies.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Finally, an American Idol winner with a good Album...something they haven't had in a while.  I enjoyed almost every minute of this album with the exception of a pretty bad sax solo in one of the song.  However, I hate the saxophone with a passion, so I may be a little biased.  I am a fan of Dave Matthews, so his music falls right in line with the kind of music I enjoy.  Excellent first album.  Can't wait to see what's next.
B0041D843M|5.0|Everyone in American should read this book as it will help this country out of our healthcare crisis. Amazing, hopeful, life-changing book and I highly recommend it. I have reversed my high blood pressure b/c of this book. You will learn so much about food and the human body that is it astounding.
B0087HT36U|5.0|so much fun and very addictive. Played for hours and time just flew by. Could not put it down. The whole family enjoyed.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|A great film from Zack Snyder.  I loved the music, the settings the effect, but more importantly the ending and overall themes throughout.  Most people and reviewers hated this movie, but I think it was amazing people really need to check out this beautiful movie.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|I love the show but the best video quality I can get its poor. I have a superfast video connection but the best I can get it for like 380. Which is not even standard definition in the old days. The video streaming doesn't even compare to Hulu, Hulu plus, iTunes, Vudu, etc.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have a lot of down time at work , it keeps me from being bored. I love using my nexflix also.
0441020712|5.0|Good to see Mr. Reynolds rocking it again. I consider him to be among the top 5 of modern producing sci-fi authors. While the storyline seemed somewhat circular, overall it was a pleasure to read. I am looking forward to a continuation of this storyline.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Was a funny family friendly piece. Would happily watch over with the kids. Loved how adolescence was displayed with out going overboard.
0316212377|3.0|While the \\"Culture\\" series of novels has one of the richest and most interesting universes I've come across in sci-fi this book just never takes off. I just couldn't get attached or really care about any of the characters. Not a bad book and there was some great stuff in it but the characters themselves were just not that compelling. Still Banks' imagination is awesome and I look forward to seeing what he does next.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|As one of the grandest epics ever filmed, I have been waiting for the Blu-ray scan of this film for a long time. Originally shot in 70mm film, one of the largest film formats ever created, the older VHS and DVD versions were pathetically inept in displaying the scale and magnificence of this film, but this Blu-ray version contains the original unedited film in an 8K scan version, the highest quality available on the market. This is a must-have for any movie collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is better on big screens because too many mistakes when the circles get really small. This game is hard to put down. Good for all ages.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|A masterpiece of political satire, this is easily Stanley Kubrick's funniest film. Fully remastered, it is beautiful to look at, and just as funny as ever. A must-have for Stanley Kubrick enthusiasts, and a must-see for anyone else.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It was easy to install, and it's great that I can access Facebook on my Kindle Fire HD, and shop for other applications to install on my Kindle Fire HD....however I would really like to have the ability to install the Weight Watchers App on the Kindle Fire HD.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|As probably the biggest Indiana Jones fan on the planet, I highly recommend this Blu-ray collection. Every film looks and sounds amazing, and the book-style casing is beautifully done as well. A must-have.
0688014291|5.0|This book will only take you about an hour or two to read; and those just may be some of the best two hours spent. Blanchard outlines a simple method to help you achieve your goals while modifying and reinforcing the behaviors of others. The perspective is told clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the One Minute Method.<br /><br />If you buy this book you will not be disappointed. I initially purchased this book as required reading for one of my classes and I couldn't be happier that I was introduced.<br /><br />This is a great gift item for those who are into self-help books or business professionals. Enjoy!
B002361MLA|5.0|There are many great reviews of this wonderful book and I don't believe I can add anything to provide any more meaningful content.  My only comment is that this book came to me at the right time and this is important.  If the reader is not ready, this book may very well be meaningless.
