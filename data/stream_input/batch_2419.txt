B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook Kindle seems to be an older version v/s Android or Iphone, Ipod.  It would be nice if they were to update it so that it would have the same format that Android and the others have.  Just my thoughts and I've been wrong before!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The second season became soap opera-y.  The 3 season brought it back to form.  Except they can't keep the peeps on the payroll so they have to kill or remove them from the story.  Really, Dallas was all a dream.  Stop killing people just replace the actors.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Great brand name buy @ $55. MSRP @ $295<br />Perfect everyday watch to wear with casual jeans, khakis, etc<br />Pleased!!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|The case fits the Garmin 800 just right, and it allows all of the buttons to function properly and the ports to open.  I fortunately have not been able to protect the ability of the case to protect the GPS, but it seems like it will help when I do drop it, again, eventually...
B001B51B9M|5.0|I ordered this DVD because our local middle school performed the junior version of this musical and I wanted to see the original version.  So good!
B00AYM6JFO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this Willie Nelson CD.  For it being his Birthday CD I thought it would have been a much better production and choice of songs.  I will probably never listen to it or suggest it to friends.  I will keep for keepsakes. Very Disappointed, Willie
B0013TTLDE|3.0|The author did an excellent job of conveying the somewhat scattered and not so lucid thoughts of the elderly narrator. The book got off to a slow start, but was very engaging once it got going.  I had a hard time believing that it took the narrator so long to realize one of the major plot revelations as it related to her.
B00471Z3CI|5.0|I remember seeing this when I was younger, and then they tried to make 2 more which were not as good as the first.<br />Still I watch this over and over.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Its hard to put into words how much I loved this book. It was recommended to me and it is truly hard to believe this is her debut. You will not be disappointed!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A couple of my tablets are hard to see if they are actually charging.  This app shows that and so much more and in great style.  Free version works fine but designers earned their money so please buy the pro version if you use the app.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|This CD fitted right in with the other four I have.  Now I can listen to the soft oldies but goodies.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is my favorite game ever after the first temple run you get a lot more features like the jungle the tunnel a bigger ape a rope to swing on diamonds to collect you also can save your self it is awesome on a scale of one to ten it breaks the scale
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Just as exciting as the first and well worth the read. I fell head over heals in love with Vin and the team! A must read!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved it! Mysterious,romantic,a little creepy. I enjoyed the black and white and all the creative things that were done with only two colors and the shades.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is absolutely NOT my kind of movie -- and I loved it anyway. An unexpected delight. I was browsing for a movie to watch and, in a sort of Goldilocks twist, didn't want anything too heavy or too light. This was just right.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a fantastic adaptation of a thrilling story.  The pace is slow and don't expect this to be a an action film.  It can be an artistic piece with thorough character development and great acting.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it. Though if I were to make it better, I'd make the characters go faster, at least on the kindle. If you download it on an apple product, you've reached a greater distance in a shorter amount of time, which is better for your score.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|It was a bit difficult to understand at first but within a couple chapters, I caught on & I couldn't put it down! I laughed & cried with the characters & fell in love with them all right away! An absolute must read!!!!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It had just the right amount of hidden object puzzles and mystery. Worth the price.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book, I would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of zombies. And even anyone who doesn't like zombies. I loved it!
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|the only reason i tryed this app was it was free. it only reads txt and text pdf files. nothing else even shows up. this is not a kindle fire app.
B0090SI460|5.0|excellent movie, my kids enjoy it and was exactly as described.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Anna Faris rocks in this comedy, glad to add this to my movie collection.  Funny and crude humor, just my kind of comedy!
B0086700CM|2.0|well first of all it is the same thing over and over and over and what I mean by that is it is the same background and the same obstacles so if you are board<br />this game will.make you more board.Trust me once I<br />got temple run 2 I deleted this game in a heartbeat!
0345350499|5.0|I first encountered this book in college. I was taking a course on Arthurian legends, and blanched at the sight of this hefty tome. No one wants to read a 1,000-page book with an exam at the end of it.<br /><br />But the magic of Marion Zimmer Bradley's book was that it transported me to a place I wanted to be and that lingered in memory long after the book concluded. This was required reading? Bring it on.<br /><br />So I went back to this remembered gem recently, worried that like other books of my youth it wouldn't live up to memory. Relief. It was just as good the second time around. I finished it two weeks ago and am still mulling it over.<br /><br />What did I like about The Mists of Avalon? Morgaine, the dreaded and evil Morgan La Fey of legend, is given a well-deserved reboot by Bradley. In the author's capable hands, Morgaine is not a diabolical agent but a priestess of an ancient goddess religion that has been demonized by a powerful new religion, Christianity, and its followers. Arthur's demise and the fall of Camelot also hinge on this battle of warring religions.<br /><br />What Bradley does so cleverly is take the essential elements of Arthurian fantasy--Uther Pendragon, Merlin/Taliesin, the Lady of the Lake, Mordred, the search for the Chalice, etc.--and give them a spin. Yes, these things happened, dear readers, but let me tell you the REAL reason. And yet Bradley manages to build up in the last chapters that sense of nostalgia and longing for time gone by that is essential to many tellings.<br /><br />As a side note, while reading the book I had the feeling that Bradly had read Frank Herbert's Dune and borrowed ideas from his Bene Gesserit order for the priestesses of Avalon. Anyone else get that sense?<br /><br />Other Arthurian books I'd recommend: Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy, which begins with The Crystal Cave (though it's been a number of years since I read them). You can't go wrong with E.B. White. Thomas Berger put a humorous yet respectfultwist on the Arthurian legend with Arthur Rex (1978).<br /><br />After reading The Mists of Avalon, I had a craving for something similar. I turned to strict historical fiction novels: Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\" and Diana Gabaldon's time-traveling \\"Outlander.\\"
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|First, this is a slow moving game.  You get to do a few things then have to wait because you are out of coins.  Yes you can buy coins but that ain't going to happen for such a low performing game.  Missions are either slightly ahead or lag behind your actual progress.  The worst is the fact the app malfunctions and loses your work in progress which costs you coins.  Good thing this was a free game.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I loved this book! Its a perfect book for middle schoolers. It also give  you a visual input of what th  holocaust was like from a young boy  point of view.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|This movie is a litle different in many ways but in good ways, I enjoyed every minute of it, a must have for my collection
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|basicly you start off with a beast machinegun jetpack<br />and get coins to buy gadgets;cloths;other jetpacks;<br />and more.so hopefully you get the idea
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The alarm is great and works every time with lots of settings this a great product awesome is all I can say
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I bought this for one reason, and one reason only. &#34;Histories and Lore of Westeros.&#34; As someone who got on board right before Season 2 and quickly fell in love, but have no desire to read the books and ruin anything for myself, this is great. I started watching the Histories and Lore videos on YouTube, but they took too long to load, and also there's like 60 of them. Really great stuff. Basically it tells you about the religions, history of houses, and events like Robert's Rebellion, but from the point of view of various different characters! Really great way to learn the back story and help to really grasp who they're talking about and why things are as they are! Totally worth it JUST for those special features! not to mention the making ofs, featurettes, etc. AND It comes with BluRay, DVD, and Digital Download versions. Can't beat that! Even if you don't have a BluRay Player yet!!!
B002APU580|5.0|A little more than the usual British display of social stratification. More about issues that affect us regardless of class.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Better than I thought, gave a deeper understanding of the main character.  Saw the movie as well.  I usually read book first, this time I the read book after the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|on the first temple run it is like the same thing over<br />and over.But on temple run 2 you have minecarts and<br />streams and more awesome obstacles!! I highly recomend this app!!!!!!!
B00CKKHB0A|5.0|So much has happened this season and it brought me back into the show as far is feeling all the ups and downs, characters that have been sort of had been 'robots' the last few seasons without the attachment I felt to most of them since the beginning. It was nice to see them as \\"human\\" with their own demons and conflicts, which made me feel angry,sad,happy,conflicted..I was invested once again.<br />With that said I know the end is near, I see so many plot lines for season 8 as I feel some foreshadowing was exposed in the finale. Hannah saying she always thought it would be Dex going to jail or killed first. Do you think she may be the end of Dex? His first love, her grasp on him with her knowing it is dangerous, as she may be the survivor of the fittest which was talked about at the end with the \\"grim reaper\\" who decided the snitch had to die ( Dex's mom).<br />I know that the scene was meant to be speaking of Dex's conflict on killing Laguirta (Dex's snitch-the one who found him out) but I believe it could apply to Hannah also,as Dex was the snitch-to keep his sister safe,it also shows me Hannah's love for Dexter is not truly love,for she wouldn't harm someone so important to him, whatever the cost maybe,you don't do something that drastic if you TRULY love the person (example)Deb and Dex,it may not be a sexual relationship but it is love at its purest form,the kind that is equal in what they would do for each other and not what is best for themselves-as Hannah only cares for what she wants.That again could very well be seen differently also, as do these killers really \\"love' and their 'love'is most likely not something I would relate to as I am not a killer and fortunately don't have a clue as to what 'feelings' they have,but they are defiantly not the norm. These writers are clever and that foreshadowing (if it is) can very well been a set up for next season without us truly realizing it with such an emotional ending that had me focused entirely on the events unfolding and the end of Laguirta's story,Debs conflict,emotions, Dex's undeniable loyalty to his sister as her to him was just a rollercoaster and reality check for me as a viewer. How they pulled me in was great to experience again with the show. It was after watching again and knowing the outcome, I picked up clues (or a vivid imagination ;) ) but so many scenes had double meaning to me. Did anyone else see any bits that make you question exactly what words applied to not just this episode but also planting seeds and perhaps showing seeds planted years ago, with the inclusion of Doakes flashbacks as another example.<br />I truly hope Hannah isn't the end of Dexter, with one season of her character (but significant in being the \\"one\\" love for Dex) but not significant enough as me the viewer to be powerful enough for any conclusion in the series as she isn't someone I feel invested in after many years of watching the show, and this is just my opinions, me maybe reading to much into the episode that i'm playing detective, so please feel free to tell me I'm nuts (kindly i hope) but I would like to know if others have insights also, and what they may be.<br />I feel Batista will be involved and not retired next season, I also think Quinn will be a player/for Dex, as he knows their is something up with Dex, and with his own demons I feel he will be helpful in someway to Dex in season 8.<br />Deb I am at a lost for where this character is going, she could also be the one to end the madness, if so, I think it may include the end for her as well. I don't think she can go on doing what she does to save her brother, but I don't think she can go on without Dexter. If she is the one to stop things, I think she will take her life as well.<br />I hope I am writing this in the correct area, as I did review some of this episode, but speculating quite a bit on next season, but that is coming from what I observed from this episode and season in general. So I apologize if I went off topic here (new to reviewing) and just want to share and hear what others have to say.<br />I will end here,I'm sure I have more to say on this subject as it digests some more, but thank you all to have read this long review and now I will put out of your misery ;) if I have made no sense.<br />Great episode, season and can't wait til next season starts!<br />Take care all :)<br />Shannon Leighpic here (new to reviewing) and just want to share and hear what others have to say.<br />I will end here,I'm sure I have more to say on this subject as it digests some more, but thank you all to have read this long review and now I will put out of your misery ;) if I have made no sense.<br />Great episode, season and can't wait til next season starts!<br />Take care all :)<br />Shannon Leigh

B000A78Z82|5.0|I love this cd and the price was great. Took some time to get here but it was well worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Pretty addicting game.  Nice way to unwind yet exercise the old brain.  Colorful graphics in an easy to use app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|minecraft pocket edition is awesome once you get the<br />first update.You get more things and bocks;but anyway<br />it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game and picking up the hints and tools along the way.  More games like this this!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I needed it for my garage door opener and it did its job. Difficult to write a review for something that either works or doesn't. It worked, case closed.
B00AW0KGYI|1.0|The only complaint is that nowhere was it mentioned that this would not be able to be played on Australian DVD players and yet it was known by the person selling that they were sending it to Australia.  Very disappointed but a lesson learnt and will not buy overseas products again.  Very disappointed young daughter though!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Brilliant mixing of classical music with contemporary pop music. Very unique and uplifting. The album was even appealing to my pre-teen and teenage children.
0374533571|5.0|I loved this book...we are all a little bit crazy in our own way.  I have not seen the movie yet, but would love to now that I enjoyed the book so much.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|No more battling with tiny eyeglass sized screws!  Very simple, twist and compress design is easy to set up, locks together without loosening and no drop in sound quality.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely addicted to it! Perks me up on a bad day, and I get immersed in it till the point that my mother yells at me!for a high school girl in India, this book is the best entertainment.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I truly did enjoy this book. It was extremely entertaining and had a good message without being too zealous. My only issue, and I understand that even a book has it`s limitations, that I would have really liked more story from many of the characters. Again, the characterization was great; I was able to really absorb myself in a lot of the storylines, but others I was just left feeling dissatisfied or at the very least, wanting more. This should not discourage you from reading this book. I think there is something in it for everyone, that is just one opinion from one reader, where others may not have been left with the same want for more from some characters.
B00CL68BK2|1.0|Paid for it, they won't let me download it. I'm upset about it to be honest with you all now.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I liked the story but at times the movie slowed down and I lost interest.  The effects were done well.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I love anything Tolkien so I love that they are doing these - but The Hobbit is not a 3 epic movies kind of book. It's a little slow because they drag things out for that reason I think. Still, did I mention I love all thing Tolkien? :)
B00A6L78YE|5.0|If you love psychedelic rock then you are certainly going to enjoy this release.  This will certainly make the listener want to wear tie dyed t-shirts.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|helps me to remember to read my bible, it's quick to the point and even can read out to you!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig has really done a great job with the character.  How can you not like a bond movie anyway!
B0085MK2KS|5.0|This set is a joy. Gould really bring out these pieces anew, and in the process makes for great listening. There may be some controversy about Gould opinions of Mozart, but as Gould said he only plays pieces he cares deeply about. So he care's deeply about ALL of Mozart Sonata's and they are all here. A contradiction? Maybe... 24th concerto is brilliantly played as well.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|If you are a fan of Suede then you will want to own this re-release.  The bonus tracks and DVD are worth the price alone.
B004I744AS|5.0|fast &amp; thotough, fun word games &amp; facts. It defined jargon that I could not find in another dictionary. The text is crisp and the pages setup is clear. explanations and examples help clarify the definitions.
B000002AGN|5.0|I played much of his music in my high school jazz band...I forgot how great &#34;Take Five&#34; sounded!  It's loaded in my car CD player now.
034580404X|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK!! All three books were great plus the seller I purchased from sent them to me brand spanking new! Thank you so much I am now having my family read the story as well. Can't wait for the movie!! Very rated R! lol
B00BDSRISA|5.0|If you enjoyed their previous release then you will certainly enjoy this one.  It seems guitar pop has returned.  C'est tres bom.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good game, but found out from the doctor that I got cancer.<br /><br />Anyways, I'll go outside now and play some football in the alley.
B0049U4INC|5.0|I really liked this book.  I have been following Guy for years now, and this book was excellent encouragement for me to share my personal story to build my business.  I am not sure I would have had the courage to be vulnerable and share such a big failure if I didn't have others around me (including this book) telling me to go ahead.<br /><br />Also this book gave me even more courage to publish my own book too.  Thank you Guy.
6305428050|4.0|Language gets a little edgy, but I'm rather liberal - Christian or conservative families will probably get upset. But, by the way school children speak today and what they know - they won't be learning anything new - but it is a very entertaining movie for kids with liberal parents.
B00AYCOUOG|4.0|Glad to see one of my favorite guitar bands from the 1990's getting together and making new music.  Very good reboot of a once almost great band.
0345529057|5.0|Watched the show and I was sold, had to read the books<br />Great for a summer collection. The price is under $5 each.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game when you have a few minutes and you just don't feel like doing anything productive. Will definitely keep.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not the story I was expecting! Interesting characters and lots of plot twists made this a fast read. Very clever!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I had never watched Fringe until the Science Channel began to carry it and now I am completely hooked. Of course, now that it is off the air I'm hoping for a follow-up movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought the movie was great. I really enjoyed it.  Hope  there's a sequel.  I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, and anyone that  has , to watch it again.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I downloaded this and my hubby and I played it in the dark before we went to bed. Not entertaining for either of us, but my teenager and her friend had a great time with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun because u get to go to different countries u also get to fly on a jet pack and it gives u a bunch of coins
B009AMANBA|5.0|It was more of a documentary, but enjoyed it, since I love history.  I would recommend it if you like movies like this.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love the sons!  Each season just gets better and better.  On the edge of your seat excitement.  And just when you think you know what conning next, bam your completely caught off guard. Gotta go watch season five.
B008I3RARW|3.0|It's an okay game, but a bit difficult to steer. I didn't know if it was me or the game so I had my hubby try it out. He agreed it was okay, but not something he'd obsess over playing. Don't know if I'll uninstall it or not.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|First and foremost, most people that see this movie enjoy it.  If you start watching it and for some reason think it's no good, continue watching because the end will blow you away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The end makes even the most intellectual lightweights think!  It's fan 'freakin' tastic!!!  Give it a watch!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|The case is cushioned and the kindle fire fits perfectly.  Works well for travel , but slim enough to carry around day-to-day.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|this video is good full my spectations and my son love it .brand new perfect conditions and. more than I think
B005T87QCI|3.0|This game was fun for a while, but then it stopped working on the Kindle and it is very frustrating, pulling it up only to watch the loading screen stare fixedly back at me.  Don't recommend buying this.
0156027321|4.0|I read the book shortly after the movie came out.  I saw the trailer for the movie before reading the book.  It takes awhile for the book to really get to the beef of the story.  Once I got about half way through the book, the excitement started happening.  The ending is the best part of the book and the journey that is reading it is definitely worth it.  It's a very good book, the only reason I rate it \\"like\\" instead of \\"love\\" is that I didn't know where the book was going for 200 pages.
0470901071|5.0|This is a great book. Exactly what I was looking for. I have also purchased the online videos by the same author. The video's go chapter by chapter with the book...
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZING!! You can actually shoot arrows and build homes. You can do survival and start with nothing, or do creative mode and have unlimited materials! Even though it's expensive, it's worth every penny!  Hope you buy this, it's AWESOME , The best app ever!!
B009MYARIK|3.0|Not Sophie's best but it was a good read. The characters were not superficial nor were they dull. The story was ok albeit not a very plausible one. Lottie was somewhat annoying and I could strangle Ben. Fliss and Lorcam were by far my favorite characters and Noah was just a hoot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Don't think because it's the third book that Suzanne Collins would hold back! There's never a dull moment in this action packed finale! You feel every emotion Katniss feels plus some! Good luck putting it down until you're finished but then again you may just start it over again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the beauty of the country side, the warmth of the characters, and the wit of Maggy Smith. Hooked on Downton Abbey
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its fun and amazing how they change the themes the only problem is when i move to the right or left some times it will go down or up im not sure if its only me or it happens to others also the characters that you have to collect itiems for take to long to get but on the plus side the characters are cool and i especially loke the boards that have power ups like super jump or staying low but they cost way to much...ya thats my reviw
B00190OHD6|5.0|Rarely does a movie make me genuinely sob, then quickly laugh and move on! Hillary Swank is beautiful and Gerard Butler is adorable!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I purchased a copy of Jonathan & Charlotte's excellent album &#34;Together&#34; online from Amazon as sadly their CD was not released here in New Zealand - a great shame as I am sure there are many fans of their incredible talent here.<br />The service I received from the UK provider was excellent - the CD arriving in my mailbox within a fortnight of my ordering it. Well done to all concerned.<br />As with everything that this marvellous young couple have acheived, the quality was up to expectation and I am very satisfied with all aspects of the transaction and would encourage all like minded people to do the same as I. Well done. Thank you.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Easy read, actually found it hard to put down at times. A great book to relax and unwind, no thinking required. Some great twists.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I give this app five stars it is so much fun it is a great game for horse lovers that can't have horses.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very entertaining.  Visuals and audio are pleasing to the eyes and ears.  Highly addictive and even causes a little fatigue in the fingers.  :0)
B000FA675C|5.0|I read the Chinese version years ago and watched the movie as well. The book I got was for free. So I dont have reason to not be satisfied.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A wonderful and thought provoking journey. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, felt as though I too was joining Harold on his pilgrimage. There was no pretence or rhetoric, just raw thoughts and feelings, not only of Harold but also those left behind.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This would be an incredible novel if it weren't a completely true story. This story is so incredible that it seems like it is fiction and understanding it is real makes it even more amazing. This is a story of fallen heroes and the man who survived against all odds. This is a story of real heroes, not the pop culture false heroes that are worshiped in the media.
0452289963|5.0|This book changed my life and instantly.  If you pick up this book and it does not touch you then put it down dont bash the other or those who excitedly recommend it.  Those who are ready for the truth will find the truth and the shift happens while one reads and a realization that this is one of many writtings that will bring positive transformation within and then the manifestation begins and continues effortlessly.  This is  not a how to get what you want by using a religious formula.  This is an inner change that mysteriously evolves, when truth is spoken.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've had this game on my droid before, but it is even better on the kindle! I would highly recommend this game to anyone regardless of age.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I loved this game. I also enjoyed the graphics and story line. I felt it was challenging enough to keep my interest.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|Great little case. Quality is top notch compared to other cases of brands that have been around quite some time. Took on many trips and holds up great!
B002OMZTSU|5.0|If you've watched The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, you may have caught glimpses of the sensitive person underneath the hyper host. In this book, you get a long look at this most colorful, honest, inspirational human being.
034580404X|5.0|All I can say is I could not put the book down.  It was a little on the usual side but a Good Story!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a wonderful book, especially for reading out loud to children. It's a timeless book that will make you smile and think longingly of the imaginations of youth and the enjoyment that can be found in the simple things in life. It might be tough read for younger children to tackle on their own, but I'm confident that all ages will love the Secret Garden. I know that I will continue to re-read it again and again as I get older.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't watched this show, then start from the beginning.  This is a great show with a great plot and great actors.  I love that the show doesn't just focus on the death and the gore (which they do very well!) but also include the human side of the story.  We get to see how the characters grow and deal with the changes that have come.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool was an interesting book. It was recommended to me and I can honestly say I'm glad I read it. It is a very ingenious, imaginative dystopian society with vivid characters. It had a plot that was constantly twisting and things are not what they seem.I would recommend it to readers over the age of 13 or so since the plot can be a bit slow at times and some parts are a little slow.<br />I can honestly say I enjoyed it and I will never be able to look at a silo the same way again!

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Now that I have discovered the point and click/hidden object adventure games I play nothing else! I have been through many, some good and others great like this one. I enjoy the hidden object scenes but don't like too many in a game. This game has just the right amount. The graphics are amazing and the story is good. The puzzles are not too hard to solve as in other games they are too difficult. This is one of the best I have found so far!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft so when I heard there was a pocket edition I almost flipped.  I play this game on the Xbox so I knew a lot about this game.  There are enemies that come out at night. There are also,many animals such as, cows, pigs, chickens, and more! You can use some of those animals as resources or they can be your pet! Anyway this game is so fun and is totally worth seven dollars!
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|I love all the characters they have a great chemistry with each other, I enjoy the story plots and how they develop with the personal lives of the players.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book creates a strong note, you are introduced to a surreal after-civilization (kind of modern Roman empire) scene where every year &#34;chosen&#34; youth has to fight against each other for their survival in a carefully designed huge studio with lots of danger. It is quite shocking and it is very easy to learn to love our main character girl who of course will win (and you know  it since it is a trilogy and the same girl is the narrator of the events). The strange, at the same time cruel and childish (just look at those Capitol adults) world resembles a fairy tale kind of realm.<br />I really liked the first book, I must tell.<br />I was however dissapointed a bit in the following two volumes, as I felt that the logic injured during the journey.  I loved however some turns of events: e.g. the final game of selecting former winners as the emperor (call him president if you wish) finds out the former and celebrated winners are a threat to his rule.<br /><br />I think overall it is an OK book, but probably means more stars if you belong to the youngsters and love fantasy literature.

B000LB7G00|4.0|I use this for Solidworks and ANSYS workbench. Takes a little while to get used to, but is time saver after that.  I just wish I had gotten the one with more buttons to make it easier to use my shortcut buttons.
B002BVQU5A|3.0|my takeaway is Sam swinging in front of the mental(?) hostpital where Joon is being isolated, what a wonderful exciting moment in the depths of despair for someone who sees no options n only fear from the past...  just perfection, who came up with that scene, I love you!!!  i did have problems with Joon's presentation of illness, just mumbles through thoughts and touches her face too much?? If you saw Shine, RainMan, Scent of a Woman you would see so much depth to a personal struggle from childhood trauma this is soooo much more believable and wonder what type of direction she got to express her 'condition'... I was amazed that Depp did his own falls on concrete like Charlie did and suffered limited consequences, at least as far as I can tell, Jack Sparrow didn't really limp did he???  what a beautiful, sexy man and is so believable in his character that one can't help but fall in love with a dang movie character, very very rarely happens and attributes Depp's abilities to translate such a complex character... I did not fully comprehend Aidan's relationship to Joon other than a shared tragedy and his inability to accept someone who improves his sisters situation is anathema to me, hence I recommend for JD fans and his physical comedy aspects which were until now unknown to me and am even more impressed with his acting skills, wish the music tracks were more aligned to the script as I am a huge Stevie Winwood fan but just did not work for this film, can't wait to see this again!!!
0810983915|5.0|This was a gift for my niece. She loved it. Most 12 year olds do. The book it self is good quality and looks like it will hold up to lots of reading
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this item from Amazon for about $39.99. When I first found this on Amazon, my first impression was \\"what/who is Anker\\"? I have never heard of the company before so I was skeptical about buying something that was not known or popular in the west. When I think about gaming mice, my mind goes to Logitech. But because this thing was affordable for me and it's Prime Eligible, I had nothing to lose. If I don't like it I'll send it back. Easy as that.<br /><br />My reason for buying this was like any other gamers' reason: make playing FPS and RPG games a whole lot easier. I needed my \\"go-to\\" skills/potions/etc. to be on my dominant hand.<br /><br />After trying it out for about a month, this mouse is AMAZING! The main feature that I really like about this mouse is that ALL THE BUTTONS can be customized! (Except for the profile button underneath the mouse but hey who even uses that when you're in a rush in a FPS game?) Even the DPI switch can be customized to work as something else. You can macro or bind the buttons to a key on the keyboard. Yes even the left and right click buttons can be configured to work as something else. You will have to download the software on their website to customize the buttons on the mouse. You can save multiple profiles for multiple games so all you have to do is save/load your customized profile and that's it. There are generous amounts of buttons on the mouse so I don't feel short-handed.<br /><br />I play Battlefield Play4Free. This thing won't put you on the top of the leaderboard (it takes skill not equipment), but it does aid you in getting to your critical equipment/actions quickly. Now I don't have to deviate my left hand to get to my equipment/critical actions. My critical actions are mostly on my right hand. For a FPS game that means that I can keep moving while doing my critical actions. Same thing with Torchlight II.<br /><br />This mouse does include small customized weights but, for me personally, I feel no need to use them. The lights are aesthetic so I don't need to comment much but it does help you determine which profile you are currently using for the mouse if you chose to customize multiple profiles.<br /><br />Overall, this product is an excellent buy for me. It delivers for my needs when playing FPS games. Buttons can be customized. The price is almost a steal (seriously $39.99 dollars). It offers good features. I read reviews that Anker has some good customer support but I never tried it and I hope I don't have to. If the product works awesome then there is no need to call support.<br /><br />Thanks Anker and Amazon. I hope Anker goes in to making gaming keyboards with high-end features at a not so high-end price.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Fast paced and fun, light as well as dark, inspiring and captivating! The second in the Selection series is a must read! I didn't expect half of what happened, nor to be brought to tears multiple times. Worth the heartaches puffy eyes my friends!

0399162097|5.0|This book is really touching on so many levels.<br />It deals with the shattered family dynamic after the loss of one of the family members.  In this case, that family member happens to be a chimpanzee.  As part of a psychological experiment, a young chimpanzee was placed with the family and raised as a twin to the youngest child, Rosemary.  Fern, the chimp, and Rosemary are inseperable for the first six years of their lives then, without warning, Fern is removed from the household.  Little explanation is given to the young, confused Rosemary who rather than trying to find out the truth, simply tries to make everything right again by doing exactly what is expected of her at all times.  Her older brother Lowell reacts oppositely and begins to pull away from everyone.  The slow disintegration of the family as it refuses to deal with the loss of Fern is completely believable.  It's something that my family went through and is still going through after the loss of my very human younger sister. It's heartbreaking.<br />The novel also explores how animals are treated by modern society as part of scientific experiments.  Lowell eventually becomes a member of a violent Animal Rights group.  Rosemary is our narrator so all this is told through her eyes.  She wonders at times whether what she remembers from childhood is really the truth or a memory that has been created through hearing other people tell the story or looking at photos.  She is weighed down by the guilt that she carries for abandoning Fern as well as by the stigma of being \\"the monkey girl\\".  There are no earth shattering revelations here.  It's just an honest look at how loss affects us all both personally and as a family and how being honest and opening yourself up to the pain that comes with the honesty can lead to a healing of your heart and mind.  It's a beautifully written and wonderfully readable story.  It will make you think about what defines family and loyalty and love.
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book keeps up the action from page 1 till the end. i love this book a lot. love the  book. great job rich roidan
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|It is a great game,  ut it really needs to have an offline mode.<br />I spend a good bit of my time without wifi, so I am left without any way to play this.<br />if it ever gets an offline mode, then it would be perfect.
0307744434|2.0|I read the online synopsis for this and thought it sounded interesting. But it's not. There seems to be a lack of excitement or personality in the majority of the characters. They just drift through the book aimlessly, without any real purpose. I found the parts in between chapters where the author switched to using &#34;you&#34; instead of &#34;he&#34; or &#34;she&#34; to be distracting. I am honestly struggling to finish this book, and it's not often that I do that.<br /><br />I was expecting to read a novel that was a bit different than the standard 50 shades of grey and werewolf/vampire/fairy paranormal romance. It certainly is different, but the actual book has not lived up to my expectations.
B004SIP8W0|2.0|Since the Italian film Life Is Beautiful deals with the Second World War and the Holocaust, many viewers watched for signs of insensitivity; really they were looking for any traces of irreverence towards subject matter which forces the filmmakers to tread carefully.  The very notion that this film could be a comedy offended some viewers.  My unease was of a different sort; the way that Italians portray their nation's involvement in the war.<br /><br />It has become a widely accepted notion that Italians were victims of the NAZI's - presumably due to the Wehrmacht's slow fighting retreat up the peninsula during the last years of the war.  But is that a truthful notion?  After all. the Italians invented Fascism.  Mussolini came to power eleven years before Hitler, and was a role model for the latter.  NAZI Germany came to Italy's aid when they ineptly invaded Greece and Egypt.  When the Allies landed in Italy, the Italians switched sides and greeted them as liberators.  Given this appalling wartime record, can the Italians claim equal status with the French, Greeks, et cetera as innocent victims?  They can and do claim that mantle, but should not.  Vestiges of Fascism remain in Italy to this day.<br /><br />I know the rejoinder: \\"Come on, it's a comedy.\\"  But it is a pretentious comedy treading on important history.  Millions of people define themselves today in relation to that conflict, therefore the truth must be served.  It's not an easy task, but the obligation remains; it's therefore a queasy experience to sit through this.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Has all the features you would expect from a gaming mouse. I like the size, fits my hand well and the adjustable color is a nice touch. The only thing i did not like was the side mouse buttons. The only way to customize them is using the mouse software as you cannot select them from inside your game control settings, instead you set them to the key you use in the game (by default they are set to Crtl, Alt, and Shift).<br /><br />There are profiles available you can configure for the mouse for each game so that does alleviate some of the issues of having to set the mouse and change it for each game, but I do miss using those buttons like I have on other mice and the ease of setup using the in game control settings.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|Just came across this & realized I'd bought it last year.  Jay has some good ideas; some of them are too restrictive for my personal lifestyle, but that's what's always great about Self Help books: one can take from them what one wants & leave the rest.  That assumes, of course that the author isn't crusading & trying to tell hers is the only way to go...& Jay doesn't do that.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has an interest in the subject.
B008220D7S|4.0|This movie was hilarious and laughed through the whole time even the 2nd time seeing it along with my mother who is just over \\"39\\". I'd prefer it over Knocked Up for sure. The only thing I wasnt pleased with was the *amount* of foul language. Definetly not a movie for children around! So if your looking for a funny movie(the fact that its a spin off of Knocked Up should've given folks an idea as to the type of humor involved!) this is it!

B002FVTNZU|5.0|Vito Bratta is a master on the guitar.<br />One slow Friday night in the early 1980s I was sitting in my office, I managed a concert hall in the Baltimore area and to my surprise I heard this outrageous guitar playing, I took the long walk to the stage to see what I was hearing and it was an unknown band from NYC who traveled all the way to Baltimore for a gig paying $50.  I was awe struck at the caliber of this unknown band.  That was the night I became a fan of  White Lion forever.  I talked to them after they played and told them how much talent I believed they had and I would do anything to get them work in this area.  Long story short, they played in Baltimore and they also were seen by the right record people in Baltimore that led to their signing a deal with Atlantic.  I was so happy for them.  I just wish Vito would come back out and play, it is such a waste.  Mike Tramp is a fabulous front man and has magic vocals.  The writing of their songs were mostly Mike and Vito.  I would love to see them play one more time !<br />This album is their best, their songs tell a story.  I highly recommend this album if you love metal that is well written and played even better - THE BEST!!!

B009B1UZ7C|4.0|Came across this name a few times, sounded like my thing so I gave it a listen. The first song hooked me in as quickly as Adele's 'Rolling In the Deep' which I heard before it's  release and was electrified by (as was every one else). Opener 'Lightning Bolt' is my favorite track but there are many other very good ones. The last part of the album slows down and is more produced but still good (and may grow on me further). Hell for an 18yo this is incredible! Most lyrics are original and show a maturity beyond his years.I won't try to compare him to others as he is a distinctive artist but if you enjoy singer songwriters, Dylan, Ryan Adams, mid 60's garage style music and like things fairly lo-fi,roots based and clattery though with a melodic sense this dude may just add something very positive to your listening. Should be an interesting career ahead as long as he keeps some of the products he sings about under control!
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Look, if you're a runner, swimmer, of cyclist - this book WILL blow your mind.  Your form is wrong.  There, I said it.  You don't have to believe me, just read this book!  It not only will show you, it will explain why your form sucks and best of all, it will show you a form for each sport that will keep you competing and a high level and keep you injury free.  Brian MacKenzie will blow your mind...<br /><br />Highly Recommend!
B005D4YGTY|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to pull the trigger on these, as the color was a bit lighter than I wanted.  The neoprene liner looked really orange.  But it looks great in person.  Fits perfectly, as all previous pairs.<br /><br />Found a great tip to keeping them smelling great.  I had an old pair that looked great, but smelled nasty.  Read that baking soda can eliminate smells, and it does.  Got a huge bag at Costco for under $10.  A think layer all over the inside of the sandal, left overnight pulls the stink out.<br /><br />Now I alternate these new ones with my old pair.  Great.

B009HOU672|5.0|Antonio Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons' has long been one of my truly favorite pieces, and I've had several recordings of it over the years on both vinyl and CD.<br /><br />Richter's re-scoring of this masterpiece is truly magnificent, blending just the right amount of 'the old' with the right amount of 'the new'. His 'new' parts are very refreshing, adding a vigor and a liveliness to the original that is utterly wondrous and beautiful.<br /><br />This was a very gutsy move on his part -- he ran the risk of alienating a great number of listeners -- but I think that the risk has paid off.<br /><br />The Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin, under the direction of Andre de Ridder, and Daniel Hope's soaring violin make for a lively yet reverent performance.<br /><br />I love it.

B00B69UQEO|2.0|It’s unlikely that Delta Machine is going to win over a new generation of Depeche Mode fans.  I count myself among those that pine for the days of the mid 80’s to mid 90’s when their music soared over mountain tops and took you on epic journeys.  1997’s Ultra was the last time I truly enjoyed the whole of a DM album, and it remains one of my all-time favorites.  Nowadays, Depeche Mode beckons you to come and dwell with them in the dark catacombs of post-synthpop ruin.<br /><br />Delta Machine’s opening songs are grinding, droning, laborious and rhythmically erratic.  By the time the first six tracks are over, “Broken” feels like an overdue gesture of up-tempo mercy.  As a long time DM fan, maybe this album just needs a chance to grow on me, or maybe we’ve just grown apart.  I remain hopeful for the former.  Delta Machine is the latest in a line of recent albums reaffirming that, once and for all, the era of lush, atmospheric anthems like those found on Black Celebration, Music For The Masses, and Songs of Faith And Devotion is officially over.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This biography really paints the picture as to the awe aspiring accomplishments of a man who has had the passion not just for great companies but for a great legacy in humanity.<br /><br />The crux of the book would be that anybody, if they really wanted to, could achieve the best of what life has to offer. It has to be said that his life was truly captivating by the fact that everything that Jobs had to offer was about excellence, and making sure it endures with age. He possessed a God-like aura to himself which stands as a testament for mankind. A Control freak, to sum him up, but you could see the rational when you head through his journey whilst reading the book.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anybody, really. The book is quite the inspiration for the companies (and individuals) we will hopefully see in the future; dare I say even the person reading this review. If at all self-help books don't get you a jump start, I guarantee this book will.
B000001GX8|5.0|...Decca recording. I find this one of Bohm's best Mozart opera recordings, along with his incomplete 1955 Decca Cosi fan Tutte, his incomplete 1975 DG Cosi, his 1955 Decca Magic Flute, his live 1963 Figaro from Japan (on Ponto, with Fischer-Dieskau, Grummer, Koth, Berry, and Mathis),and his late 197Os Dresden Idomeneo and Clemenza di Tito plus his Dresden Abduction from the Seraglio. His Figaro here, Hermmann Prey, at least matches Kleiber's (EK's)<br />Cesare Siepi. Both sparkle and elevate the comedy while dramatizing its ambivalence. Mathis is<br />a delectable, impish Susanna (with more than a hint of Despina), -a match for EK's gorgeous<br />Hilde Gueden. Troyanos for Bohm and Danco for Kleiber are fine Cherubinos. Both Bohm and Kleiber employed peerless, ideal Countesses, Janowitz and Della Casa. Try their letter duets individually  and add the Tokyo Figaro letter duet (Grummer and Koth).<br />Both Counts are less than perfect. For EK, I shrink from what I consider Alfred Poell's unpleasant timbre. While Fischer Dieskau's sound is agreeable, he also engages in some bluster/huffery/puffery on occasion-I prefer him anyway.<br />The VPO sounds ideal and a major asset for EK, beginning with a truly incredible overture.  On the whole, Kleiber sounds lighter and quicker, but Bohm does not drag. The air in EK's reading is more rarefied-I do not exaggerate in sensing a conducting genius at work // his RCOA Beethoven<br />symphonies #s 3,5, and 6.  But an inspired Bohm-e.g here and in his Clemenza or his BPO<br />late fifties Brahms 1 and 2- was formidable in his own right if not quite as stratospheric as Kleiber.<br /><br />Peers- Kleiber/VPO/Decca, Bohm/Live from Japan/Ponto. On a slightly lower plateau but quite attractive: Marriner/Decca with a mostly excellent cast (Van Dam is the esception for me): Raimondi, Popp, Hendricks, Baltsa, Palmer, Lloyd. Raimondi, Popp, and Hendricks are a formidable trio and Marriner captures some of Kleiber's elan.

B004OZZ624|5.0|\\"The Next Three Days\\" defines suspense. Will this end well or badly? Avoid spoilers!<br />*************************************************************************************************<br /><br />There are very few movies where you can't guess whether things will end well. (The only movie which ever gave me a true suprise ending...\\"Open Water\\"...turned out to be factual retelling of actual, bizzare events.) You can almost always bet, before you hit play, that the \\"bad guys\\" will screw up, or that the main character will \\"save the day\\" with some extraordinary gun shooting, stunts, or physical superiority.<br /><br />This is NOT one of those movies!<br /><br />\\"The Next Three Days\\" is a rare gem of excellent writing, and the icing on the cake is Russell Crowe's superb acting...never over-acted, a \\"guy next door\\" who could be someone you know. I am not a fan of action flicks...Hollywood prefers looks over talent, brawn over a good script. I loved this movie!<br /><br />*INTRO*<br /><br />The night after a dinner where Lara (Elizabeth Banks) tells her sister-in-law she hates her boss, police arrest her for the woman's murder. Her husband, John (Russell Crowe), a professor of English Literature at a community college, is left to raise their son as he spends years exhausting every appeal with the help of a lawyer friend, to no avail. After his wife attempts suicide, in the middle of an analyis of \\"Don Quixote\\" by his students, he realizes he has no choice...he must break her out of prison.<br /><br />*MAIN REVIEW*<br /><br />John tracks down a multiple prison escapee who warns him, \\"Before you start, ask yourself...could you never talk to your family again?

If you don't think you can do all that, don't start...you'll just get yourself or someone you love killed.\\" Chilling words indeed! \\"You have to know how they plan to catch you.\\" (He points out that since 9/11, all cities have a plan to seal off the downtown in 15 minutes, to have road blocks at all toll booths and on all major and secondary roads in 30.) Anyone who has researched privacy issues or has experience with witness protection knows the truth of these words. (Have you read \\"How to Dissappear\\" by J. J. Luna?) You cannot tell ANYONE where you are going.<br /><br />Most movies are reaffirming, a RARE FEW are cautionary tales. I could not tell, from moment to moment, how this one would end! For every step John took, I couldn't tell what he was up to. On the rare occasion I had an \\"aha\\" moment, I was wrong...he was doing something else.<br /><br />Will John's getaway plan be good enough? What if something goes wrong? (Something always does.) What will he do? That comment about leaving your kid at a gas station prompted a sense of dread. Will this be a cautionary tale about the folly of thinking you can get away with murder? (And did she do it?) Will he lose his wife? Will his kid grow up without both of his parents now? I thought of that warning about leaving your kid at a gas station when John leaves their kid at a party...I thought I knew what he was doing, but I was wrong. I can't tell you won't guess the ending...you have a 50/50 chance of being right...but you won't KNOW anything!<br /><br />This is NOT your typical \\"action\\" film...forget the guy who's going to shoot up the city and lead the cops on a spectacular car chase with explosions and crashes imobilizing everyone but himself. Nor is it a strictly intellectual enterprise, some \\"melodrama\\" that bores you to tears. Nope!<br /><br />This movie is TRUE SUSPENSE, beginning, low-key, from the moment his wife is arrested, building slowly as he bumbles his attempts to raise money and takes bigger risks, reaching a fever pitch when (*** MINOR SPOILER ***) his wife will be moved in 24 hours, and he is not ready to roll. (*** End spoiler ***) Every time he looks at those numbers on his arm, and at his watch, you know the minutes are dwindling when the door will be shut on their escape. When I thought the movie was at its climax, I looked to see how much time was left. I was shocked to discover well over a half-hour was left. This is WAY better than an \\"action\\" film!<br /><br />Just as the leads are not your typical hero and heroine, the cops are neither accidental geniuses nor bumbling idiots. With the resources of law enforcement today, you know (*** MINOR SPOILER ***) when John screws up...losing a peice of his car's bumper when his robbery almost fails (*** End spoiler ***) that they will narrow down the owners of that car in minutes, and put the peices together quickly. And, just when you think they've made it, the lead detective, flipping the coin found at John's house, watches it come up heads -- the Canadian side!<br /><br />*TERRIFIC ACTING*<br /><br />Russell Crowe is not your typical \\"action\\" star, though he's had a couple of those movies. This must be one of his best films! What I LOVED most was the relationship between John and Lara. At the start of the movie, it's quickly revealed their relationship has its problems. His wife is insecure. He doesn't take his sister-in-law hitting on him seriously. He jokes (to his son!) about the day his wife files for custody. With a few minor exceptions, Elizabeth Banks' acting is almost as good as Russell Crowe's.<br /><br />It isn't clear whether their problems are serious. But during his jail visits, you learn how much she relies on him. The loving way he looks at her...how well they understand each other...how she knows he would lie to make her feel better...how he refuses to believe she murdered her boss.<br /><br />When he shocks her with the prison breakout, she reacts as you would expect. In the car, when she is questioning what he's doing, you're silently urging her, \\"Just TRUST him.\\" If she doesn't, it's all over. And then something goes majorly wrong...now what? Those who attempt suicide are weak. I won't even hint...but you need to catch your breath as badly as they.<br /><br/>Thus follows one of the best moments in the movie. Their communication is amazing, without words. Like John's plans, I thought I understood what wasn't said...and I was wrong!<br /><br />Will they get out in time? Will he find a way to get their son after they make their own escape? Will her moments of weakness spell disaster? Will someone remember seeing the rental car careening along the highway? Will John's parents crack? Will his parents end up in prison, too?<br /><br />I didn't know how things would turn out until the movie actually ended! The only thing you know is, this is a rare movie however it ends! This is the best near-three hours I've spent in a long time. (Excepting the phenomenal operetta \\"Les Miserables,\\" of course -- another film for your \\"Must See\\" list.)<br /><br />Don't let anyone ruin this movie for you...avoid spoiler reviews!

B00164KYV4|5.0|I found myself watching this EVERY TIME I saw it playing on TV and decided I needed to own it.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I was excited to see this app; I'm always excited when a non-game appears as the Free App of the Day.  But I was disappointed to see the reviews.  However, most of the reviews cite the &#34;horrible&#34; text-to-speech voice.  I had to try it just to find out how bad the voice was.<br /><br />Answer:  I don't find the voice bad--seems about the same as the usual Kindle text-to-speech voice to me.  I found it okay to listen to. At least as okay as the text-to-speech ever is.  Note that another review talks about switching the voice using a sideloaded voice.  I don't think that's possible on the Kindle Fire; I looked for the options in the Fire's settings that the other review mentioned for Android devices and I don't think they're there.<br /><br />I think the app actually works pretty well; but it badly needs instructions.  Note that it reads more than just PDF files.  I think for the people who really need to be able to have PDFs, Word docs and DMR-free ePubs read to them on their Fires, it's worth learning the app.  <br /><br />The real negative to me is the lack of instruction.  I'll hit the highlights here.<br /><br />When you open the app, you'll have to agree to a long EULA (end user license agreement).  Once past that, you'll basically see a blank screen with four icons at the top representing four different tabs:  speaker, folder, bookmarks, settings.  <br /><br />When in any of the four &#34;tabs&#34; at the top, you can swipe the side/bottom menu bar and tap on the menu icon for options for that &#34;tab.&#34;<br /><br />You'll want to go first to the second tab--the folder.  It will default to show you the list of folders on at the &#34;sdcard&#34; level.  If you've played files before, it will also show you a list of recent files played.  <br /><br />It's kind of slow to show all the folders available to look in; you have to be a bit patient.  Also, to go back after looking in a folder, you have to swipe the sidebar/bottom menu and tap on the &#34;back&#34; button.<br /><br />There's an option to search.  If you start to type a phrase that would be in the book title, it will show you files that meet that type; unfortunately it will only let you search for Word or PDF files, if the file name on the device has the word in it as a whole word, it will find it. (PDFs sometimes have weird numbers; also wildcards don't work). You choose whether Word or PDF by tapping on the little icon to the left of the search box.<br /><br />Or, you can tap on the menu and choose &#34;File Manager&#34; which will let you use a file manager such as ES File Explorer. If you do use an external file explorer app, once you find the file you want, tap it.  A pop up will ask you &#34;Pick Up File As&#34; with the choices &#34;Normal Android Way&#34; and &#34;File Way.&#34;  I chose &#34;Normal Android Way.&#34;  It will open the file and go back to the PDF to Speech app and begin playing the file.  I used the ES File Explorer more than the native app to find files; once you've found the file, it will show up in &#34;Recently played&#34; within the app.<br /><br />Pressing on the &#34;speaker&#34; icon unexpectedly showed me the current sentence being read in the current file, along with some rudimentary (crude) controls for moving in the file.  You can apparently draw gestures to play the file, but when I tried that, I could never get it to continue playing again and ended up clearing the cache and starting over.<br /><br />Note that you can have the book/file keep reading as you work in other apps, so be sure to pause the book before you quit the app if you don't want it running in the background.<br /><br />Tapping on the menu for the &#34;speaker&#34; tab lets you bookmark a point in the file.  However, the app will pick up where the book was last stopped even without a bookmark.<br /><br />You can also go to a web page  to have it read.  I didn't try that.<br /><br />If you go back to a recent file as shown on the folders page, it will pick up where you left off.<br /><br />The bookmark tab will show you a list of bookmarks for the current file.<br /><br />The last tab is the Settings.  You can change the language (except that English is the only language shown?), set it to read the page number.  &#34;On&#34; is the default, I turned that off.  You can also have it read the header and footer of each page, this is off by default.  You can have it read with your music in the background.  And you can set the size of the text shown when viewing the file on the &#34;speaker&#34; tab.  It's a sliding tab.  You can also change the speed and pitch of the speaker's voice here.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is so easy to use. It's easier than a regular calculator and it shows all of the calculations so I don't make any mistakes.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Fun and kind hearted little story. I never read the original story that the movie was based on. It was fun to discover the random things that Disney changed. And it's rather nice to read a &#34;nice&#34; story for a change.

B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Saxon goes back to what makes them good.  Heavy metal rocking.  I've enjoyed the trend they've been on since Lionheart.  It's a shame they don't have more fans in America.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This is the only movie with Denzel in it that I didn't like.  It was too slow moving,  The storyline was too simple.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did.  Still love Denzel tho!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's hard to get used to the tilt controls at first but super fun and addictive once you do! I love that you can change how you want to control and sensitivity! Very well done, love it :)

B008RZF2I0|5.0|The new singer works really well. The music and songs are the best since Ghost Opera. Kamelot has made a triumphant return!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Just would like to see more conflict resolution. Like when Reacher has to disarm some one or deal with a fist fight. This novel was not as suspenseful as the others. And some of them I burned through. Thanks LC!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book, Mockingjay, ties the trilogy together beautifully.  It's still not something you'd want to read independently of the others, but it is very well-written and Suzanne Collins will have a tough time topping The Hunger Games trilogy!!

B000QRIGLC|4.0|I enjoyed the book it was factual, and displayed appropriate humility. The SEALS are an exceptional group of men. I am recommending this book to my friends.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I read the one page version of this story, which was being passed around on the internet.  I passed it along to friends and one of them suggested reading the whole story, which is in this book.  It is very well written and an excellent read.  It brought tears to my eyes twice but you'll have to read it to see if that happens to you.  Very poignant.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The characters are amazing and have so much depth. It is so much more than just an erotic book as I originally thought when it was recommended. So glad I read it! Now on to number 2!
0307476073|5.0|Very well written - and so down-to-earth.  Reminded me of my own experience of losing my mother - wish I'd known about the PCT then.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So fun I purchased all the extra &quot;packs&quot; or levels.  I agree with all the other reviewers starts super easy and increases in difficulty.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Downloaded this book Free on Kindle and boy am I glad I read it. I can totally see myself reading more of her books. This is an emotional book but with a great ending.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|This is a fun puzzle game to play. However the game will occasionally exit itself when I am in the middle of working a puzzle.
159102594X|4.0|I'm going to come out and just say it, The Blade Itself kicks off with action from various point-of-view characters whose storylines intertwine in an interesting and believable way.  Joe Abercrombie has created a world of fading, but still deadly magic with monuments from a legendary age made famous by legendary figures in which ordinary characters suddenly find themselves interacting with.  The narrative covers locations over three continents of the First Law world, in which we observe or learn three distinct cultures thus further building up the world.  But what most impressed me was not the book concluding with definite end, but instead &#34;open ending&#34; that made the reader yearn for Before They Are Hanged.
0525953728|3.0|I am glad that I read this book as it gave me a bit of an insiders look into what it took to pull off this top notch mission to get<br />UBL.  While it wasn't written in a style like a professional author and while knowing the ending before turning the first page, it was still a book I was glad I read.  Even more so when I watched Zero Dark Thirty within days of finishing it.  I would highly recommend reading and watching in this sequence!  The two of them together work like a charm.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|i like the way she acts in this movie so cool wish i had her for a girlfriend wow to kewl
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I hope Christopher Nolan continues to make more Batman movies. This movie wasn't quite as good as the Dark Knight but I'd put it right there with Batman Begins.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|Interesting story but the author's issues with the Catholic church were distracting and unnecessarily harsh. Even if there is truth to the history, it felt personal and vindictive.
B006T5GTK0|1.0|Australian color film is much better, although it is five hours long, but worth the extra viewing time, trust me.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|i loved this book it made me laugh and cry! can't wait for the next book! thank you kiera cass !
B005K17RU0|2.0|This new app has great options, but none of the videos or animated maps work on droid razr. Commercials play of course.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I bought the game to pass time . And it did the job . Especially when my 4 year old nephew picked up my tablet and started playing it. Easy to play and easy to enjoy.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I am a Tolkien Fan. and o love this movie as the rest of the Lord of the Rings Series
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Omg Amazing game! Definitely will give you a good scare from time to time but its definitely a must buy! It's so addicting also! Do buy!
0615782043|5.0|One thing for sure you have to be a lover of GPA's poetic style to be able to take in and enjoy his words. He is like no other, he's GPA...a refreshing type of voice in the world of poetic words and style. Your mind must be open and your imagination ready to take it on.<br /><br />I have had the pleasure of reading and reviewing GPA's previous art, so I knew exactly what to expect. I read and received it without disappointment. It was an anticipated read that he marks as his \\"Erotic Biography\\".Couldn't help but love that he is allowing us to know that side of him...not in a harsh out right nasty erotic tone but in a soft sensual type of way that will have your mind wandering and if you are not careful will definitely take you there.<br /><br />\\"Revenge of the Orgasm\\" left me again saying wow GPA, you've done it again. In true GPA style all of the pieces in this book gave a play on words but were easily understood to where he was going with it.<br /><br />One of my favorites is<br />\\"Westin Incident\\"...umph! You'll have to read it to know what I'm talking about<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it in its entirety and recommend this book to anyone who loves erotic poetry and sensually spoken words
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses this is a first pick. I love this game and everything about it. I hope you like it too!
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Ths cd is another great addition to my collection.  These kids are so talented and I love when they record an old song.  Would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys Glee.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|This is Awesome thriller which keeps you thinking all the time through out the movie. I highly recommend the movie to anyone.
1439127727|5.0|I bought this book when my dad heard the author talking about it on a radio show. It took me a few months to get around to buying it, and after reading it, I wish I would have gotten it earlier. Personally obsessed with presidents, and always enjoying a behind-the-scenes look, this book was everything I wanted and more. The book startes with Herbert Hoover, and goes up to President Obama describing their own struggles in the White Houses as well as how they relied on, fought with, and befriended their predecessors. What an amazing read to any President/history nerds.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|Ready to Die offers enough great songs to earn five stars, despite the one clunker. \\"Job,\\" \\"Gun,\\" \\"Burn,\\" and the title track are blistering, concise, and sardonic, with more humor and grit than any of us have a right to expect. If you doubt their power, check out the recent live NYC performance video posted on NPR. Iggy and the Stooges start the set with these songs, and they hold up admirably to the classic material. My admiration for this album has a lot to do with James Williamson's guitar. I'm in awe of his riffs and tone, which are creative, natural and expressive. Also, listening to the studio album you might assume you're hearing dense layers of guitar overdubbing, but watch the live performance and you'll see that Williamson is creating most of those \\"layers\\" in one pass. I've read a bunch of other reviews of Ready to Die, and the music critics' ambivalence about Mr. Pop still comes through, but they can't have it both ways: They can't say the new material doesn't hold up to the old, when many of them never liked The Stooges in the first place. The claim that the 66-year-old Iggy doesn't have the fire of his youth sets an impossible and irrelevant benchmark. His age and experience is now an advantage, otherwise we wouldn't have two heartfelt ballads, the near-mystical ode to \\"the Departed\\" Ron Asheton, and the beautifully lyrical \\"Unfriendly World.\\" This album is great [enough]. Give Iggy and the Stooges their due. The fans and the critics lapped up the recent David Bowie release The Next Day, but Ready to Die has already earned 50-times more repeat plays at my house (thanks to NPR and Amazon[today]).<br /><br />Update: On further listening, I have to acknowledge Mike Watt on bass, Scott Asheton on drums, and Steve MacKay's sax. All great. In the Stooges' live performances, the saxophone in particular is often buried under mega-decibal guitar, but on Ready to Die it really comes through beautifully.
1592407889|5.0|A few years back I saw an episode of late-night t.v. where Shirley MacLaine had a guest appearance.  During her vignette I was  aware of her demeanor, & expressions.  She was on some self-important celebrity tangent about her friendship w/Frank Sinatra like it was some exclusive occurrence to the survival of mankind, & all I could think was \\"wow, is this broad full of herself or what!\\"  The camera pulled away focusing on her facial expression, her nose held high in the air w/an arrogant expression, & I thought \\"boy, someone sure is holding court!\\"<br /><br />So recently when I read about the release of Parker's book which detailed a lonely childhood at the hands of neglectful, self-absorbed, shady Hollywood parents,  I immediately thought back to her appearance on the Late Show & said \\"well, there it is!\\"  Her art imitated life...at least her life.<br /><br />Lucky Me may seem tabloid-esque on the surface, however, it is well-written, objective, & often redeeming of MacLaine.  Parker talks about \\"walks on the beach\\" w/her mother, & later, how her mother rescued her from an abusive boyfriend.  Also, how MacLaine would read bedtime fairy tales to her, & paid for expensive boarding schools.  Ultimately, though, this proves infrequent, as she's shipped back to Japan to live w/ her shady father (her primary caretaker) & his cruel mistress once her mother grew bored or returned to filming.  The book reveals how MacLaine was bilked out of millions by her estranged husband due to an absurd tale involving \\"outer space & a clone,\\" Parker's dad's inappropriate behavior w/her, & MacLaine callously throwing Parker to the wolves upon high school graduation. She refuses to pay for college, by declaring \\"you're on your own now!\\"  Not to mention MacLaine's plausibly subversive & demeaning attempts to squelch Parker's acting career.<br /><br />Through it all, Parker eeks out an honest, & meager existence often relying on the kindness of strangers during tough times.  She bounces fromone waitress job to another, finally, reaching the pinnacle of waitress jobs...flight attendant, & sometimes winds up in a bad relationship or two.  It's possible some of the story may be far-fetched, but I believe the goings on between both parents are accurate for the simple fact that what kind of mother permanently sends their child to a foreign country alone?  How can someone that fancies themselves as so \\"spiritually evolved\\" & \\"superior\\" as MacLaine does, be so egotistical & self-centered as to not even help their own kid out with college?  She completely goes against the basic tenets of these ancient philosophies she espouses.  Where's MacLaine's gratitude in having power but not really using any of it for good?  I could understand not wanting to engage in nepotism.  Who knows, Parker may not have the acting talent her mother does?  However, I do think it is a parent's responsibility to give their child a chance if they're financially able in terms of college.  Also, why maliciously & consciously set someone (especially, a \\"loved one\\") up for a fall?<br /><br />A must-read, page-turner for sure! It illuminated Hollywood's corrupt tactics from the vantage point of a celeb's child trying to get a break.  Hang in there Sachi w/regards to your mother, as my mother always told me, \\"if the police don't get you, karma will!\\"
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a basic cover that works just fine.  The stand works fine if you're sitting it on a hard surface.  Good product for the cost.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books in a week. It took me a while to read this trilogy because of all the mixed reviews. I am so mad at myself for not reading it sooner. Great storyline and I cannot wait until the movie comes out!
B00BSBXA98|3.0|I love Cirque. I live in Las Vegas and I've seen every Cirque show here a couple of times. So I was excited when I heard about this film. I was expected a Cirque movie, instead what I got was a filming of an existing Cirque performance. That doesn't make it bad, it just makes it not that interesting if you've already seen that performance live.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I did not expect  that dividing this book into three parts  would work.  I was pleasantly surprised  ad thoroughly enjoyed this movie and looking forward to the next installment.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book goes beyond the other screenwriting books and tells you what you need to know to be a better writer.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book is WORTH it for all kinds of curly hair!  Completely will revamp how you take care of your hair. Main points are to only finger comb in the shower, use shampoos and conditioners with no silicone or sulfates, and squeeze your hair dry with a microfiber towel.  Search YouTube for instructional videos.  I thought the book did a great job of explaining &#34;why&#34;
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|If you ever saw the old Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone in it, forget about it. This movie is nothing like that. This movie is good. It maintains the feel of the Judge Dredd comic series very well, and delivers with kickass action and a plot that actually makes sense. I strongly recommend it.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|even as an adult, I really enjoyed this movie.  Danny deVito did an excellent job casting and directing.  Mara was great too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could read the trilogy and then just start over again! The story is awesome.... not to mention the sex scenes rock!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds it's my favorite part of the day except time with my family this is worth every penny buy it your going to enjoy and love it to
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|As always this G5 game was really fun.  I have purchased this game some time ago. This was my second time to play. Still enjoyed it. Not hard to play! Just. the right length.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|Fairly true to the book but at times it was slow and I had to focus.  It is a movie to ponder and the ending is sad.  A good representation of the twenties.
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book is great for validating normal and natural male and female actions and reactions to life.  Women are show what they do to unintentionally drive a man up a wall, how to understand them and be supportive of them.  Men are shown how they misinterpret what a woman is saying versus what she is meaning, how to show her love and how to grow together with her by avoiding provoking her through repeating back his misinterpretation.<br /><br />My wife and I are communicating much better in a very short time after getting into this book.  It takes commitment, practice and patience.  Each person in the relationship MUST be willing to change their way of thinking and acting toward their partner.  Both must give 100% for this process to succeed.<br /><br />We found an interesting revelation through this book.  My wife was using Prozac and it made her very aggressive.  Somehow this book made her think into that area and she is now on a new antidepressant that is causing her to behave more in reason as a normal woman does.

1596680199|5.0|This book is perfect for every polymer clay enthusiast! I bought this book on a whim after flipping through it. I loved the layout, plethora of color photos and step-by-step techniques. I'm SO glad I decided to purchase it! Over 2 years after I purchased it, I STILL find myself going back to it again and again. Not only to learn new techniques, but for inspiration as well. I wish all polymer books where laid out as well as this one is! The book is broken down into 3 sections plus a gallery full of beautiful work by leading artists in the field. The Materials & Techniques section walks one through all the basics of working with polymer clay, color blending techniques, appliques, embellishments, texturing, transfers, inlays, stamping, mokume gane, mica shift, and caning all organized from simple to more complicated methods. The second section covers Faux techniques. Including wood, marbles, Ivory and bone, leather, amber, coral, bronze, abalone, jade, mother-of-pearl, silver, malachite, turquoise, lapis lazuli, onyx, and agate. Again, these are all organized from simple to advanced. All of which are easy to identify when flipping through the book. At the top of each 2-page spread are beautiful examples of the techniques in different settings and usages. I use this book just about every time I am working on any project. Even once you have mastered all the techniques, it's still wonderful to browse through! With it's wonderful photos for inspiration and an occasional nudge in the right direction. Don't let the title fool you, this isn't just a great book for making beads, it's great for anyone looking to expand their library of techniques! Of all the polymer art books I own, this is the one I reach to first and, most often. You NEED this book on your shelf!!!

0823015017|5.0|I had a hard time finding samples of this book online and hesitated ordering it. After seeing several of today's leading artists attributing this book to their inspiration and learning I wanted to give it a chance. I'm REALLY glad I did! This book is chocked full of wonderful color photos of work! Like the most fun and interesting textbooks,  It walks you through several exercises to fully expand your understanding of color and how to use the techniques to inspire your artwork. This book is not for beginners, but perfect when you have exhausted all the basic information you find in so many other polymer art books. I can see this book helping artists who work in other mediums better understand color composition as well. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to take their work to the next level. Clear instructions, helpful tools you can use again and again and artist spotlights that give you an inside look at the background and inspiration artists use with full size detailed photo examples of their work. This book is the one I have been searching for! I promise that you will not be let down by this inspiring title!

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is definitely &#34;a good movie&#34; but not by any means &#34;a good James Bond movie.&#34; Before fans jump down my throat I'll assure that YES! I got it! I saw what they did there, what they're setting the stage for going forward, but that doesn't excuse a humorless Bond movie where the legendary 007 is only a passenger in a car chase and the closest he gets to a woman is silhouetted in a shower. Tasteful? Of course, but not Bond. This re-branding is so serious and drastic that it doesn't fit well in the franchise and the consequences to key characters feels undeserved.<br /><br />The movie itself is gorgeous, the sets & cinematography are top-notch, and Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are definitely at their best. It would have definitely earned a full four-stars if it was branded as a spy drama instead of the keynote of a 50-year legacy.

B004XGN8W4|1.0|I bought it and returned it after using it. Poor screen with limited viewing angle. When you play skyrim, you cant see the object at night since the contrast is bad. I am surprised that so many people give 5 stars to it. Yeah you can buy it but dont cheat yourself and keep it forever. Buy a portable 16'' HDTV which is around $150 now...

B004MC8CA2|2.0|Seemed like the plotting was a bit weak in this one, despite its reputation. Part one was ok, pretty exciting at times but a bit loose around the edges. Main character's journey in part two totally implausible. Is there a film version?? Maybe they fixed it up...<br /><br />Two stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The game is great absolutely love it so entertaining keeps me busy I do recommend this game to any one
1932735410|5.0|The book is a standard for the exam preparation and there's not much to say about it,  very good material as all other editions.  The strongest point in my buy was the delivery.  I live in Brazil and it usually takes up to 3 weeks to arrive from amazon,  but this time I was surprised,  my book arrived in less than 2 weeks what is an outstanding fast timeframe for standard shipping.  Well done Amazon and iParcel.

B0087DFIYA|4.0|This film was extremely reminiscent of Mel Gibson's \\"Payback\\".  It is a quirky action thriller with lots of senseless killing and a an antihero who doesn't really seem to care about much because he is so confident that life will take its course regardless.  Overall this is a fun movie, definitely worth a watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I found out about this app from a friend.Aperiently he is a total minecraft player like myself and I suggest that if you like this app then you should try the computer version and a server that I know that I have is RubyCraft the address is mc.rubycraft.net

B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great in some spots, but others could use some work. The characters are being killed off too quick, before you can get a knowledge of who they were or what their gift to the series was. If they do not offer something to the series, why even bring them into the series. There is not enough time for them to develop.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|A great read.  The story wanders at first, as French recounts the confusion and intrigue that characterized pre-War Peking, but comes to an exciting conclusion.

0062014536|4.0|Requiem is the third and final book in the Delirium series, and told in dual perspectives between Lena and Hana. Though I'm sad to see this series end, I'm looking forward to whatever Lauren Oliver has in store for us next! I'll be keeping this review short and sweet, since I don't want to spoil anything for the series.<br /><br />I think what stands out most about this series is how much the characters grow and change over the course of the series. Lena, Hana, Alex, and Julian all change, but I really appreciated Lena's character arc. At the end of Requiem, she's an entirely different person than the naive girl she was in Delirium. I also really liked reading from Hana's perspective, and seeing the differences in her after she was cured, and what it was like living among the \\"zombies\\". More than once, it made me think of the book/movie Warm Bodies (I highly recommend both versions!).<br /><br />What I love most about this series is how Lauren Oliver explores all the facets of love and how it impacts our lives. Love between parent/child, friends, family, and also how being able to love changes how we generally treat each other, even strangers. This book made me think about all those aspects, long after I'd finished each book. I can't think of another series that has resonated with me so strongly.<br /><br />I fell in love with Lauren Oliver's writing while reading Delirium. The entire series is beautifully written and masterly crafted. Though Requiem is my least favorite book of the series, I think that may be because I was expecting more romance. I was a bit surprised by the ending because there's not a lot of closure, it's left open. However, I was able to picture my own ending, and overall I was satisfied.<br /><br />I listened to Requiem on audiobook, and really enjoyed it. I appreciated how Sarah Drew performed the book, and didn't just simply narrate it. Though I didn't like all her voices for the characters, I think she gave a great performance. Her tone, and the inflections of her voice captured the emotions brilliantly. I loved the interview with her at the end, and hearing what she thought of the characters and the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series, and I can't wait to read more from Lauren Oliver! I'm stalking her website for what's next!the inflections of her voice captured the emotions brilliantly. I loved the interview with her at the end, and hearing what she thought of the characters and the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series, and I can't wait to read more from Lauren Oliver!

B0073TZ1AA|5.0|I tested it with a .pdf file and a .doc file and it worked well.  It does not read .docx files though, which is the default file in the newer versions of MS Word, so you'll have to make sure to save your file as a .pdf or .doc if you want to use this.<br /><br />You can change the speed of the voice in the settings which is nice because the default speed seems a touch too fast for me.<br /><br />I have a short story that I have been meaning to read, and now I can listen to it on my way to work.  I plan on copy/pasting some long articles into Word and listening to them later.
159102594X|2.0|Jezel (the arrogant young nobleman), Logan (better known as the Bloody Nine), Ferro (the former slave seeking vengeance) and Bayaz (first of the Magi) don't know how they have ended up together on this journey seeking a powerful magical artifact, and to be honest, the reader has little notion either.  Throw in the random character of Glotka (cripple and inquisitor), who is separate from the rest of the gang but given his own chapters so the reader is meant to infer his importance, and you are left all in all confused.<br /><br />At times interesting, there is a lack of clarity in the story telling that leads the reader lost and annoyed as he/she tries to follow the different plots of the novel.  Actually, I'm not sure there really is an over-arching plot.  Just side stories, some surprisingly fun, that are held together tenuously at best. And I can tell you, as someone who has read all three of the books, you never get that clarity you desire.  Instead, you are left scratching your head wondering what was the point of the entire story.<br /><br />There are much better fantasy novels out there.  I'd recommend skipping this series and one of those alternatives.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I think that Dr. Davis presents a very logical case and clear benefits for avoiding wheat. The inflammation caused by the ingestion of modern wheat can effect all of us, not just those with celiac disease who need to avoid the protein to prevent the body from attacking itself. In addition to the weight benefits alluded to in the title, he also points out how avoiding wheat can help people with many other health complaints can benefit from avoiding the grain. Very enlightening on many levels.

1742200508|4.0|\\"England\\" is another good edition in the Lonely Planet series.  Chock full of information (location, name of attraction, price, summary, etc.), the title is a great introduction to anyone interested in England.<br /><br />The book is around 850 pages and organizes the trips into 12 major sections of England.  My personal favorite was the section on London since I have a dream of visiting that city someday.  Other interesting sections included:  Cambridge, Canterbury, and Birmingham.<br /><br />\\"Lonely Planet - England\\" also contains helpful information such as:<br /><br />1.  When to visit a particular area.<br />2.  Prices for an attraction.<br />3.  Why an area should be visited.<br />4.  Colorful maps.<br />5.  Places to shop and eat.<br />6.  Historical places (one of my favorites).<br />7.  Travel distance and suggested means of travel.<br /><br />A great introduction to England.  If I am ever fortunate enough to visit the country, this book will come along for the ride.<br /><br />Recommended.

1451695195|5.0|Easy read. Credible. Comforting. I loved the fact that the doctor wasn't particularly religious before her &#34;death,&#34; but became religious later.  So she wasn't inordinately influenced by what she had been &#34;told&#34; to believe, unlike &#34;Heaven is for Real.&#34;

B007FEZQF8|3.0|Let me just say that I am a HUGE Walking Dead fan! I live in Georgia, very near where the AMC show is filmed. I have been following it since season one so it was only a matter of time before I looked into the comic, excuse me, graphic novel(s). I enjoyed the difference between the show & the comic & it makes for a new experience which alot of us are looking for between seasons. The only problem I had with it was that for the $8 I spent I would have like to had a little more than 45 minutes of reading. Great comic, illustrations & story.

B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I found the book to be clearly written and convincing.  I have tried the diet for about 2 weeks.  It might just work.  It is not that hard to consume only 500 calories a day during two days in a week. But I don't know yet for how long I can sustain that. I don't regret buying the book and trying the diet. To be fair, I should review it again in 3 months.

B008220D5K|1.0|I'm not really into New Hollywood Comedy releases nowadays, for a very valid reason and that's mainly because they're repetitive and inaffective. As a comedy this film should've made me laugh but I didn't not even once. Don't know if it's the fact that I have a very dark humor or the writers themselves have a different idea of what funny is. Personally this film didn't work for me and I'll tell you why.<br /><br />First of all, the plot was all over the place. Conflicts between the main two couples, between their kids, unresolved parents issues, financial problems, marital problems and some other useless problems. I guess yeah, as a 40 year old it's normal to have problems it's normal for any age it's a part of life and somethings you can work on resolving and some things you can't and I was thinking maybe that's what the writers were aiming at? But the moral was kinda lost there and the viewer just gets confused and bored with all the things that are being thrown at him during the course of 60 min. Second of all, the characters which are very one-dimensional at best. Annoying Paris Hilton version of a classy california Mom who's already 40 but doesn't want to admit that she's 40, she needs everything to be perfect and from the outside everything is fine really. But her constant nagging and need for perfection drives her husband, kids and us viewers crazy. I just couldn't stand her 95% of the time she's just a drama queen. She should be in the same league with her teenage daughter who's PMSing during the whole rerun of the movie. Her Husband doesn't have a brain or much of it anyways. Her personal trainer, her doctor, her friends they were all just a bunch of superficial people and thus add no depth to the story what so ever. Megan Fox is just an extra don't even know why she was ever included in this movie to begin with marketing ploy anyone?<br /><br />Of course not to mention the luxurious homes, fancy cars, 5 star hotel vacations and designer clothes outfit. Just so mediocre and typical of a California based ideology.<br /><br />In short the movie wasn't funny it was just a waste of time. Maybe I don't relate to it cause I'm not 40, but I know real people who are 40 and they don't live in fancy houses or drive expensive vehicles and I don't think they can relate to this movie either. How's the general population supposed to be emphasizing with the main characters anyways?<br /><br />I tried making as much sense of this film as I could, but there's really nothing to gain here. I won't be overacting if I said I watched a blank film for 40 minutes because I really have no words to say. It was so much like I looked into the screen and it was blank or completely white or black. That's how useless and pointless this film is to me.t so mediocre and typical of a California based ideology.<br /><br />In short the movie wasn't funny it was just a waste of time.

B0026772N8|4.0|This is a classic.  It is well written without any obvious typos or grammar errors that can distract you from the story.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|What a treasure: all of Verdi! A must-have for fans who want to survey his entire career. I admit that I haven't heard all of it yet--75 CDs is a lot of listening and I've only had the set for about three weeks--but what I've heard so far has been top drawer. My strategy: alternate works I've never heard with familiar favorites. So what if Oberto and Un Giorno di Regno aren't great Verdi? They're decent enough operas, and one learns how Verdi developed his art from being derivative to his final burst of originality in Falstaff. This is a remarkable tribute to one of opera's greatest composers. Don't hesitate; at $2-3 per disc you'll never find a better bargain.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie isn't quite a musical, but nobody sings that much and looks sane. None the less, it was a warm entertaining movie with that funny fat Australian, or British, or whatever girl in it :) She kinda makes me want to go out chubby chasin', any who, it really was just an all around fun movie, and worth the watch.
B001PKHS68|5.0|I have seen this movie many times when it has appeared on TV. I have not seen it in many years and was glad to find it available on DVD.<br />There is a lot of chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Each time I watch I always pick up something that I missed the first time.<br />It keeps you in suspense till the end when it is discovered who the real cat burglar is.

B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I have been following this show since I first found it on SciFi, BBC and Netflix. I love fantasy programs and this one was excellent. Yes, it changed the story line from the original Merlin/Arthur tale, but in the end it brought it all together. The ending made it seem like that there could be a follow up story set in the future. I hope this happens, and if does, then I hope it is done right.

My opinion, it is just a bunch of miscelanous legos that he actually could have used from is own stash, but he does Love Mine Craft so my husband and I bought it for him.  The cost is high for a bunch of tiny squares, but he important thing is that he is happy.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a fun and easy read, but is not without depth.  Collins' fluent and unique writing style guides you through the pages effortlessly, and is reminiscent of Orwell's penchant for creating new words to better suit the alternate world she has created. Thoroughly entertaining from cover to cover, it leaves you eager to plunge into the conclusion.  I would recommend this series of books to anyone.

B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The author seemed in too much of a hurry to finish the book. Just when I thought I could settle into a good scene. Bam! White space, new scene. Then IF the scene was important she let the character think about it so we could get it while she lies on the bed or whatever other technique was used. What this book needed was a really good editor to strengthen plot and character development.<br /><br />This author needs to let the story develop, enrich the scenes so the character and the reader live it together, and stop scene/time jumping.<br /><br />Character development was minimal, I think there was more in the author's mind than she put on the page. When the character had her romantic interlude there was no way she could have possibly fallen in love, according to the character, not with the information gathered by the reader when all he had going for him was looks.<br /><br />Could not finish the novel and have no desire to read the others in the series.

034547581X|5.0|This is a deserved homage to the men that fought this battle.  To think that this battle was a headsup for the administration of what could be expected in Vietnam; and, after MacNamara giving it a 50/50 chance of victory, they went and spent 60,000 American lives.  And for what, the Domino Theory.  BS, American companies are opening sucessful businesses in Vietnam. This book should be placed in LBJ's presidential library becuase Vietam is his Signature legacy.<br /><br />Damn it! Read this book.  Johnson committed 58,000 american souls on a 50/50 chance of winning this damn war.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I can't believe this book was published in 2006 and I just read it now! Where has it been? Where was I? Diane Setterfield's debut novel grabbed me from the opening sentence, and never let go.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a British mystery with so many interesting and fun elements I don't know where to start. On the surface, it is the story of a young woman, Margaret Lea, who works in her father's antiquarian bookshop. Margaret is well-read, intelligent, but socially awkward. While close with her father, Margaret has a strained relationship with her mother. Margaret amuses herself by writing short biographies of some of the lesser-knows authors whose works she has read.<br /><br />One day, Margaret receives a long, hand-written letter from Vida Winter, a novelist. The reclusive and mysterious Winter is aging and very ill. In her 50+ years as a best-selling author, Winter has never told the truth about her background. She offers Margaret a large sum of money to write her story. Margaret must leave her comfortable home and travel to Winter's isolated estate in Yorkshire. She will live with Winter while hearing her life story. There are, of course, conditions attached to the offer.<br /><br />Margaret has never read any of Winter's books, preferring 19th century novelists. Before accepting this commission, Margaret begins reading, and is immediately drawn in by Winter's unique story-telling style. Most intriguing is Winter's debut novel. Margaret reads a copy of this book,  titled Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation, which she finds  in her father's storeroom. Upon finishing the twelfth tale, the book ends. Margaret's father explains that the book only contains twelve tales. They own the only known copy of the re-called first edition. All other published copies are simply called Tales of Change and Desperation.<br /><br />This engaging story contains so many fascinating elements. It is a tale of a crazy family, twins, an addled housekeeper, a strange topiary garden, incest, and a fire. And more! It is a great mystery, with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing until the very end.

6300182282|5.0|This is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!  In my opinion, this movie depicts what true realistic love is all about.  I could watch it over and over again.  The sound track by Johnny Mathis is to die for.  This one tops Bridges of Madison County.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Alicia Keys voice and this cd is outstanding. I would highly recommend this to others. Love, love it.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I was a fan of the movies, and there are three in all if you have never watched them you should, so I decided to read the story that started it all.  Great little story and a fast read.  I enjoyed it very much just wish it was longer.  This is one of those instances where the movies are probably longer than the book lol.  Although there are slight differences between the book and the movies each follows roughly the same storyline.  If you like dystopian futures and quick reads, this is a book for you.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|I have a lot of epubs but this app claims to be able to read them but it couldn't even find them.<br /><br />Problem two. I have internal storage, internal sdcard and external sdcard. This app would not let me navigate to internal storage or external sdcard. I would be forced to put all books on the smallest storage space I have. My external sdcard has much more room but this app won't navigate to it. If it does I haven't found a way.<br />Can't comment on functionallity of app being it couldn't find anything to read except a data txt file some random app created.

B003VANOFY|3.0|A friend reccomended this to me and gave me high hopes. It is a little glichey at times connecting in Dolby surround sound with the computer. Bass doesn't do well with music either, and the distance is shorter than I thought it would be able to go.<br /><br />Voice changer option is cool and having hands free is nice.

B009X01D9U|5.0|Sturdy, great protection for Kindle Fire. Took K. F. on trips from Texas to Hawaii and Maryland seven flights. The best complement I can give it is that it enabled my K. F. to survive island hopping on No Go Airlines a division of Mesa Airlines. If you are a lower 48 person and you are very unlucky you would know the company as Go Airlines. Half of our party of eight stopped on Oahu for three days. Two of their guides commented on Go Airline. One even ask for a show of hands of people who had or where going to use Go Airline. He told them that the people living in Hawaii called the Airline No Go because of it's horrible service. The eight of us lost a day of our time in Hawaii because of No Go. Our flight from Maui was one and a half hour late leaving. A booked eight month in advance non stop 45 minute flight was changed to a stop and go in Oahu. The stop and go was a stop and NO GO. It seems that a plane with the same flight number as ours departed for Kauai before we landed. We missed the flight because it had not landed yet. Strange. The FAA was notified. Ya we know.

B00BGIC4I6|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but have to admit that the commercials made it seem like it would be funnier than it was. I was excited about seeing this movie because I am a fan of Apatow's movies and have seen all of them. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed, however, I am still a fan and will definitely see his future films.

B005NF2UE6|5.0|Article by PJ Cornell.<br /><br />Syndicated from the Asterisked Music Journal.<br /><br />Assessment: 9.5 out of 10<br /><br />Bottom line up front: Nickelback is one of the most hated bands ever to grace the stage of a rock auditorium.  The only thing I can figure is that they are hated because they create a product.  That's right -- they go to the studio and do whatever it takes to make something worth listening to.  People feel that they are somehow airbrushed and fake.  Look, their job is to create something worth listening to.  I'd rather they let the mastering artists do their job than put out a true-to-life crappy product.  It is what it is.  That having been said, this latest release, Here and Now is an exceptional release.  As usual, they run the gamut from gritty, to slutty, to inspiring. Chad Kroeger's losing battle with sex addiction continues.<br /><br />Criticisms: No one every accused these guys of being overly original.  There's a good reason for that.  If you buy a Nickelback album, you know what you're going to get.  That having been said, this may be their strongest effort to date.<br /><br />Highlights: Chad's voice has a very unique signature.  You either like it or you don't.  I do.  One of the things I love about this band is the total commitment.  If they go for gritty -- they really go for it.  If they go for violent -- they commit to it.  If they go for inspiring -- they don't hold back.  I think that's admirable.  These guys keep their hearts on their sleeves.  Their best song, by far, is Kiss it Goodbye, which is a brilliant song, both in terms of lyrics and musicianship.  It's a song about how the big city culture tends to chew you up and spit you out.  The vocals in this one are particularly well done -- the chorus plays the thin line between singing and screaming at a Major 3rd from the tonic, which, in the context of the minor key, has a distinct, hair-raising effect, and is seamlessly integrated with the rhythm section.  Holding onto Heaven is another great song.  The sparse rhythm and slow counterpoint against the sparkling harmonies in the vocals of the verse contrasts gorgeously with the full, uplifting sound of the chorus.  Wonderful song.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you don't like Nickelback, you won't like this album.  But be honest -- you secretly love these guys.  So get the album anyway.  I won't tell.o Heaven is another great song.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie received the Academy Award in 2012 for the best picture, but I was really impressed by Ben Affleck.  He is director and main character in this film and delivers on both fronts.  Affleck plays CIA agent in active duty in Washington, DC during Jimmy Carter's administration.  From the start of the movie, his character, Tony Mendez, is weary man, living alone in a small apartment apparently in a lot of personal, emotional pain.<br /><br />This is also time when great political changes are happening in Iran.  Former Shah Reza Pahlawi is exiled from Iran in the US and the new conservative religious leader Khomeini takes the power.  Iran is in dis-array and one day civilian riot breaks in.  Crowd decides to break into American Embassy and take its employees hostages.  Only six Americans manage to escape and find temporary shelter with Canadian Ambasador's home.  Their time in hiding is running out and American government creates a secret mission (Argo) to rescue them all from Iran.<br /><br />I was touched by Tony's role in a mission.  He volunteers to save civilians who served US Foreign Service in Ran.  He puts his life on the line.  It all makes sense.  After all, he has nothing to loose.  His separation from his wife and son is obviously devastating for him.  Reasons for their estrangement are unimportant.  It is emptiness and loneliness that is the pivot point of his life.  A man like that is a perfect candidate for the suicide mission.  Regardless if he makes it alive or not, he wins.  If he dies, his pain will finally go away, and so will his isolation and loneliness.  If he lives, he is a hero who has a chance ot reclaim his old life and finally redeem himself.<br /><br />And so the story goes about one man's mission to save lives of six people serving the American government who are stranded in a hostile foreign contry.  I really enjoyed Alan Arkin's role in a movie.  He plays a Hollywood producer who pulls the strings to make a difference simply out of his patriotic feelings for the country and no monetary payoff.  At the end of the film we even hear the voice of the former President Jimmy Carter who explains the secrecy around this mission that kept mission classified for nearly 10 years before public became aware of it.<br /><br />In any case, it is a wonderful film showing the humanity at its best and its worst.  It showcases important part of American history when the Iranian hostage crises took place and how it influenced the following events inthe American political history.  I have enjoyed every moment of this film - from start to finish.his patriotic feelings for the country and no monetary payoff.

0316017930|5.0|Just brilliant.  I listened to the audio version a couple years ago, and it's amazing how this book has stuck in my mind.  Fantastic job!  And I hope to hear more from this author.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|After all these years, I can truly say it was worth the wait! If you like Cinderella, or are a fan of blues, or hard-rock music, this is a must have. I am completely blown away by the range of styles here. This is like getting three or four different albums all rolled into one. This sounds amazingly modern and instantly classic at the same time. Can't wait to see you on the road, Tom, this is beautiful!!
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Let me start with I own quite a few decks of cards. I've bought a number of specialty decks (e.g. Star Wars themed, etc). Sadly, I find most of these decks are largely made to sell the name and/or artwork - not to actually be played with (at least, they feel like they wouldn't last long - I haven't actually risked a deck to find out).<br />These cards on the other hand are wonderful. Now, keep in mind I have just bought these recently so accept my feelings on their durability with a grain of salt, however that being said, I think these would last for some time. I believe they're plastic rather than the typical paper I'm used to. They have great flexibility and spring back into position instantly and they shuffle quite easily.<br />This deck appears to be \\"Bridge size\\": meaning they're a little narrower than a standard deck of poker cards.<br />They come in a hard plastic case for storage which itself is packaged in a flexible plastic box.<br /><br />As to the designs themselves: they're beautiful. Many decks I have only have unique backs, court (\\"face\\") cards, aces, and jokers. Each card in this deck has special artwork, however. The letters/numbers on the card corners and the suit symbols themselves are stylized and look very nice while still being easily discernible (in the case of the suits, each symbol bears the mark of the \\"Triforce\\").<br />Each suit bears artwork from a specific game: Spades is the original Legend of Zelda, Diamonds belong to Ocarina of Time, Hearts are The Wind Waker, and the most recent, Skyward Sword, gets Clubs.<br />Each King bears the primary villain of the game, Queens are Princess Zelda, Jacks are Link, and Aces bear a primary item from the game (e.g. the ocarina for Diamonds/Ocarina of Time). On the \\"pips\\" one of the suit symbols as been replaced with something from the game it belongs to (e.g. one of the Diamonds on the 7 has been replaced with the Bow & Arrow from the game). There are two jokers, both have a [different] image of Tingle. I'm not sure which games their artworks are taken from, but if they're from games represented in the rest of the deck it would have to be Wind Waker and Skyward Sword.<br />I'd like to add here that while the large suit symbol on the Aces have been replaced with an item from the game, the suit is still displayed in the corners under the \\"A\\" on these cards, so you won't have to recognize the item and match it to the game to know which suit it's from. (And the back of the cards is shown as the product picture, so I won't bother describing that.)<br /><br />In summary, I think the ~$20-25 it's currently being listed for is quite reasonable with it being an import. It's a beautiful and (appears to be a) well made deck that you could actually play with without destroying after a game or two. If you're a fan of Zelda or just collect cards this is a great deck to get.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books i have ever read! The incredible detail and story telling was a wonder. I buying the next book right now.I'm hooked!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just because I like it, does not mean that it is for everyone. I have truly enjoyed this game and look forward to more like it...VERY DIFFERENT and VERY INTERESTING!!!
B0068RHSZO|5.0|Here's one for that cold night to warm you up (pun intended).  The acting here is great and the story rolls from one puzzle to another.  You'll definitely want to watch this one twice or more to catch what you missed the previous time(s).
0307352153|5.0|As an introvert i had a lot of &#34;ah ha&#34; moments reading &#34;Quiet&#34;.  I feel like I belong to a community i didn't realized exists.  I burned through the first 100 pages of this book on a flight and dog eared many pages.  I'm a 45 year old sales executive and have struggled all my life in meeting people (sales is great for shy people because it give me a reason and to have a conversation with someone about something i know they might be interested in) this book is full of antidotes of people who also felt alone but found strength to succeed.  The examples of behavioral and genetic research is fascinating and convincing.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|This is a well-crafted and scripted movie that flows naturally and draws the viewer into the horror of the events happening around the cast.  Good ole Harry Potter no more in this one - Daniel Radcliffe's acting is superb and you quickly forget who he played for so many years.  Typecast no more!<br />The supporting cast is great and lends to the mystery surrounding the old house.  Be sure to look in all the corners when you are alone in the dark after watching this thriller.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|A friend recommended it and now I've gotten my whole family involved.  We watch together.  The stars are intriguing especially Travis Fimmel and if they are projecting the Viking culture like it was at the time, it's a theme we don't see very often which makes it unique.  We usually watch it on VOD since Sunday night is so full of good programming.
B00916TU00|5.0|Who doesn't love Olly, I mean come on! I recommend the UK version because it has the extra songs on it.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|It was really entertaining...especially with the humor thrown in.  I like the characters and most of the stories.  Missed this one on tv when it came out.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie brings such fun loving characters and a twisting plot that keeps you steadily interested in the whole movie. I love the perfect presentation they give of this time period and how well they show parallels between this movie and &#34;the Odyssey.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My husband downloaded this game onto my kindle and he and the children just love it.  He plays it to pass time
1401216676|5.0|This book is an essential part of any Batman collection. It is incredibly unique, being that it was written all at once as opposed to separate comics collected together, as well as having the perfect blend of exceptional artwork and an enthralling and realistic storyline (this one is probably not for the kids). All in all, a great read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am a fan, this season shows the weariness of the long fight and the toll on the brothers. This is a dark time...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This isn't your typical HO game. You have to solve intricate puzzles, thinking outside the box...so to speak. The graphics alone are worth the price. Download it now.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My grandson chose this beyblade because he heard it was strong. He was very excited to try it when it arrived.<br />It turned out to be better than he hoped. It's now his favorite Bey.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Having read all the Harry Potter books and loved the way Rowling created an incredibly fantastic world with such richly developed characters, I was considerably disappointed in Casual Vacancy.  The characters were boring and 20 pages in I was tired of what seemed to be the plot, although I really couldn't get a handle on why is was worthy of being called a plot.  I tried to read it from the beginning several times, but just couldn't get through it.  Tried to tag sale it and wasn't surprised when no one wanted it.  Not worth the space on my kindle.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Genius. Tina Fey really is brilliant. This book had me laughing just about every other page; and I only say just about every other page so that I don't sound too cliche.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|1080P CONSTANTINE FOR HD ENTHUSIASTS.THE TRANSFER,SOUNDTRACK AND PICTURE ROCK ON THIS DISC.I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND EVERY TIME I WATCH AND LISTEN I HEAR AND SEE NEW MISSED ITEMS.BUY IF YOU CAN!
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|its been a long time since ive seen this movie!!! when I saw it on blu ray I was amazed on how great it looked !!! its a cult classic! I recommend to all!!
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Love Letter is easy to learn and fast to play. My first couple of games were 2 player games. It was fun, but I quickly realized that even though it *can* be played with 2 players, it would be much better with 3 or 4 players. I was right! Played with my wife and 2 children and it was a blast. Although there is some luck involved, there is still a lot of strategy, deduction, and intrigue (especially with 3 or 4 players).<br /><br />Great game for the price.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm not an avid card sleever, but I highly recommend sleeving these cards with [[ASIN:1589948955 Card Sleeves: Standard Red (Pack)]].
B00005UNCL|5.0|its been a long time since ive seen this movie!!! when I saw it on blu ray I was amazed on how great it looked !!! its a cult classic! I recommend to all!!
B00846REIS|1.0|Ugh, I hated it. I loved the Fifty Shades series and was told is was similar. Sure there are parts that are alike, but engaging characters that you are rooting was not one of them. The story was disjointed and the characters had no redeeming qualities and even the &#34;fun&#34; parts were tedious and unconvincing.
B00371XIJE|5.0|What a wonderful and heartfelt story. After watching the movie and finding out it was a true story I looked it up on the internet to read more about it. Now I would love to have an Akita dog. Akita's are so loyal to their family. I will never forget this story and I have been telling everyone about it and tell them to watch the movie.
0345803485|5.0|This was a book club pick by someone else. I had no desire to read it, but picked it up anyway. I loved it. The story was compelling, the characters were memorable, and the &#34;fun&#34; parts were lots of fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i put this on my kindle to play and still have yet to play because my granddaughter is always playing it and she's only 3 years old and the other is 2. they fight over who's going to play and how time is spent playing
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|This is a pretty cool app.  Don't take it too seriously, it takes some practice.  It will probably be awhile before I use it for anything but fun.
B00003CXCT|5.0|GOT THESE BECAUSE THE NEXT GENERATION WANTED TO WATCH STAR WARS.  THEY ARE ALL INTO IT. GOT 7 GRANDSONS THAT ARE ALL STAR WARS HEROS
B000093BDX|5.0|Love this CD and love The Beach Boys.Every time I listen to it I\\"m a teenager again and remember all the fun i had.It is such feel good music.My granddaughter is almost five listens to the CDs with me all the time and just loves Kokomo.She loves to watch the videos of the beach Boys on Youtube with me.It really was a way of life back then that was simple and fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest both on my desktop and Kindle to get ideas for my classroom.  It's a lot like flipping thru a magazine, one picture often sparks new ideas for work.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|You MUST change your voice synth. I use IVONIA. Free and sounds great. I have tried dozens of readers and although I wish it would skip headers, footers, and Chapter Titles, there is nothing better out there. I PDFed my school books and assignments and instantly have a mobile classroom. Definitely a lot easier &quot;reading&quot; while doing other things. It even pauses correctly for punctuation. Not very excited with an exclamation point, or tone differences with a question mark, but awesome all the same. This app is a must have on all of my android devices!
B0063IH60K|5.0|We've used Solitaire often.  Both my husband and I enjoy just picking up the Kindle and playing.<br />Bought a stylus that makes playing even better.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Love this movie, anyone with ADHD will be enthralled!!! Not really a kid movie, this movie is about what is possible if only we could tap into 100% of our brain! BEST MOVIE IN A LONG TIME!
B0063GORYU|2.0|Not impressed, tried several tried to play several times but without success.  Tonight I even checked in my Hoyle for rules to see if that might help.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|The more you see the more you lookforward to the next viewing. The complex plot is wonderful. Anyone who liked &#34;Rome&#34; willhis.
B004SKLD9A|3.0|Although presented as a choice between feelings emotions and being soulless automatons that can accomplish anything pragmatic, the central theme of this film is the problem of free will and whether it is worth all the pain, suffering and misery that go along with it. The creators go for a simplistic, cookie-cutter cop-out \\"resolution\\" that ruins the suspenseful, action-packed and thought-provoking buildup. There is also one scene in particular with a character behaving out of character, given what we are told about this dystopian society.<br /><br />The action is exemplary and smooth, using gun-fu and the science of predicting gunshots to defeat overwhelming odds. Nothing to fault there.<br /><br />Spoilers follow.<br /><br />The cop-out I referred to has to do with how the creators believe emotions (and free will) are more crucial than being free from suffering at the hands of one's fellow man. I think most people, especially victims of violent crime, would gladly sacrifice their emotions if it allowed them to live life free from the risk of being murdered. The use of a drug to suppress destructive urges also flies in the face of book burning - why do both? Surely the drug would suffice. Perhaps if we did live in such a \\"totalitarian\\" society, we could one day evolve to be a more compassionate and reasonable species.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a really fun album. All the songs are wonderful and I know many will stick with me for some time to come. An impressive as hell debut album.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy. The book keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do not wish to elaborate too much about what happens in the book because it would spoil it for anyone who reads it. I feel that the element of surprise is what makes readings excitable. Take the chance, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|Some of the songs off this album are ones all be playing years from now, like Sweet Nothing and Feel So Close. Most are instantly forgettable. Do check it out for the gems though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Now I can read the Bible on the go , which is great , because it's one of my favorite books.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|I can't help but praise this album so much its going to seem like too much. As an album it flows beautifully and some of the individual tracks are among the greatest I've ever heard. Midnight City and Reunion are tracks I expect to be replaying 50 years from now. Highly recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Got this on my kindle fire HD love it ! It's one of those very addictive games that once you start playing you don't want to stop.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This show is all of the awesome. The stories are fantastic, the actors are pitch perfect, and it all comes together masterfully. A wonderful reimagining of the character that feels true to his roots.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good details in everything, thought coin & cash is to much. Going waste a fair bit of my life playing this game
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House was recommended by a friend who came to dinner and as they were driving away I was purchasing it on the Kindle.  It was a most interesting novel that held my interest and the characters made me want to follow their progress.  That is what it is all about, an author must make you want to care about the characters.  It was well written from the standpoint that the chapters made it easy to follow the story.  I enjoyed it and have recommended it to others.
1878424319|1.0|I was recommened to read this book, and was very excited and looking forward to it. The book had some very encouraging reads that you can benefit from, but parts of the book was very unrealistic to me.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|As I also had a lost childhood, this book struck a chord for me. Full of charm, humour, and horror, this is a terrific book.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|After viewing an interview with Dr. Mosley, I went on Youtube and found more about him and his Fast Diet, then bought the book.  I am on week 5 and down 12 lbs and know this will be my way of eating from now on!  Five days I eat what I please and 2 days eat only 500 calories per day and have more energy than I know what to do with.  I just cannot believe how easy it is.  My main concern is to keep from getting memory loss issues and this seems to be the answer currently being studied.  So grateful this book was written, thanks Doc!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It keeps me busy allot. It also doesn't make me bored. Subway surf's is a fun cool exciting game that will entertain everyone at all ages.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It's not a bad game.  I've played it for hours.  It is a little repetitive and sometimes you'll fail a level due to lack of time, and the next time you replay it you'll finish it in minutes.  It's quite random.  I would download it, but don't pay too much for it.  4.5/10.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Everything my friends have been talking about for years. Can't wait to get the rest of the season. Great for long plane rides on the kindle fire
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes in the harsh aspects of Ireland 80 to 100 years ago. The charming parts were<br />the everyday talk of her characters. They came to life for me. The Catholic Orphanage parts were hard to read and yet form what<br />we have discovered over the years seems to have happened. I wanted to cry in parts and to laugh in others. Just loved it.
B000002KCB|4.0|High Quality, You know you find yourself being drawn back to the older music these days. ( Vinyl ) Its a great way to get that sound of good music.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|I wanted to like this film.  I'm a total fan of rom-coms.  But.... The Five Year Engagement... felt like it.  And more.<br /><br />The time-passing sequences of spring scenes, summer, fall foliage  and snowy winter trees made me initially think that it was more like 10 years of time passing.  Although it's quite possible I just stopped paying attention..<br /><br />There were many wonderfully clever moments... but they never managed to connect.  Dakota Fanning, Chris Parnell, Molly Shannon (don't blink) and many other actors have wonderful moments.  But, then... the scene ends.  Maybe that's the bottom line for me with this film:  You could \\"feel\\" the structure of it, instead of it rolling along seemingly effortlessly.  (though we know those are the toughest to do)<br /><br />At the end, I liked our two lovebirds/hatebirds/lovebirds... but I didn't really care what happened to them.
1408215330|5.0|I love this dictionary though I'm never  tatisfied with only one  and now Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners is on its way to me as well. Next I'm going to place my third order for these dictionaries for  one more,which is the  8th edition of Oxford Advanced Learner's  Dictionary,and so I'll have the most complete and versatile dictionary as one unity in the form of three dictionaries which I regard are the best ones created ever so far along with their accompanying discs. As for Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Fifth Edition,I'd say that it is very user friendly with its illustrations,ways it explains every word,so many collocations and example sentences, information on grammar etc.,in fact it is more than just another dictionary and I highly recommend it to any learner/student or  a  second language reader of English literature.
0470876417|1.0|This will be my first return of a book I bought on Amazon.  I really don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews this has received.<br /><br />To be honest, it was an impulse buy when I was looking for a couple of business books to get me to the 25 dollar mark.  What I expected was an easy read to help map out ideas that I have for small businesses.<br /><br />What I got was a book full of fancy drawings surrounding some hard to read, overly-complicated text.  It reads like snippets from a bad college textbook.  Maybe I'm simple minded, but I appreciate plain language.<br /><br />Here is the first paragraph from the book:<br /><br />This book will give you deep insight into the nature of business models.  It describes traditional and bleeding-edge models and their dynamics, innovation techniques, how to position your model within an intensely competitive landscape, and how to lead the redesign of your own organization's business model.<br /><br />Titillating, no?<br /><br />The authors are very proud of themselves, though.  The first few pages you are treated to hand drawn caricatures of all seven authors with a list of their accomplishments and two full pages of \\"co-creators.\\"  This design by committee explains it's lack of flow.  It's too disjointed and uninteresting for even an occasional flip through.
0897500482|5.0|Love this book reading this book helped me find the type of art I wanted to learn. Wing Chun Kung Fu 80% of what Bruce tought.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A good book that kept me guessing. I thought the end could have been a little better. That Amy was something else and was not to be played with.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the characters, the story, the plot twists, the writing, the beginning, the middle and the end. Pretty much everything about this book! The author does a great job in painting word pictures so real that the reader feels they know the characters, are part of the goings on and best of all feel what's going on as though it were happening to us. At first, this appears a simple, high-school love story (like so many others), and early on I found myself questioning the great reviews and high ratings. But there is so much more here. Get a copy today and read it. I think you'll be happy you did. This is one I will definitely read again.
B006UKFFE0|3.0|While the content of this book seems good the Kindle version leaves a lot to be desired. From the beginning of the book it seems that the end of some sentences are cut off making it troublesome to read. Hopefully someone will reconvert and republish it soon.
B005K17RU0|4.0|although i think the weather videos of what the weather is going to be like is over the top, i like the abundance of information i can get with this app on my kindle. it has great accuracy of the weather by hour, and i can get other minor details through charts and graphs
B00838HSYM|5.0|I feel one of best Disney classics ever made that is truly wonderful for the whole family to watch. Especially good on Blu-Ray which I found to be reasonably priced. A definite buy for families to watch together.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Welcome to my review of Star Wars episode 3.5. No, wait it's The Hobbit. Sorry I couldn't tell through all the lame jokes, corny dialogue and absolutely ridiculous characters.<br /><br />What I liked<br />1. Beautiful cinematography<br />2. Decent action scenes and awesome special effects<br />But so what!!?? So many movies nowadays have this! Isn't everybody tired of movies that disregard good dialogue and acting for as much action and special effects as it is possible to fit into a movie!?<br /><br />What I didn't like<br />1. The ridiculously stupid brown wizard or whatever and his kooky hat and rabbit sled. Is he supposed to be on shrooms? What the hell does this have to do with The Hobbit!?<br />2. All the added in subplots. The White Orc and his revenge on the dwarves....ummm ok....ya<br />3. The corny jokes that just make the movie feel more fake than it already is. We're already watching a fantasy based movie. Why make it more unrealistic and completely take the viewer out of the movie with lame jokes the characters say when there is absolutely no reason they should be coming up with \\"clever\\" jokes in the first place. STUPID<br /><br />So disappointed. Huge fan of the LOTR trilogy. I was looking forward to this for a long time. The Hobbit is possibly my favorite book I've ever read. The charm, lovable characters and beautifully written story has been murdered, just like another franchise I can recall.......
0385349947|5.0|I just finished reading Lean In and I am inspired to voice my opinion..it was great!  I am very inspired and motivated to go to the next level in my life, not just career.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Classic movie.  3D works perfectly.  Blu ray disc also worked great.  Brand new still had plastic on it good purchase
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Anyone who read these comic books are going to love the movies.  Casting is perfection.  It's fun to see how all the characters come together to make this team!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Liked the fast pace of this book - and found it very easy to read. But at times it was a bit wordy and tiresome.<br />Over all an enjoyable book to read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It took to freaking long to get to the point and when it finally does, your too pissed about it taking so long so you don't even enjoy the first scene...hated it!!!!!
B000WMFZNS|5.0|i tried for years to locate this movie. could not believe it was not available until now. if you like history,if you like Charlton heston,if you like sofie loren, you will love this movie,its a 1961 movie ,,not 2013 remake, so  nobody has messed with it. if you are into all the high-tech in movies today,you won't like it,so don't bother,but if you liked Ben-hur,The Ten Commandments,King of Kings,The Fall of the Roman Empire and similar others, the you will want this movie,and the collectore edition gives you so much more info about the movie,about the players,about the period,it's worth the little extra it cost over just trhe movie it self.
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|It works as advertised. I had no problem with it recognizing or reading and of my Pdt documents the only problem is that I could not adjust the voice to where it was tolerable to listen to. It goes from robot female voice to murderer female bot voice when you make any adjustments to pitch or speed.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I bought this because it was cheap and now I realize it was a total waste of money. It will sharpen to a very inefficient angle and will leave most knives significantly less sharp than they were out of the factory, as in they wont even cut paper. Just save up for a nicer sharpener which wont be a waste of money.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought the Sony MDR-7506 headphones back in 2002! They have lasted 10 years and I'm very surprised and lucky they haven't been abused or accidently damaged. I've used them exclusively for recording and over the years become used to them for minor mixing duties paired with some quality near fields. I've often felt the need for better quality cans for mixing but reviews seem to be mixed about the ability for headphones to truly be accurate for final mixing. That being said, any closed back headphone is extremely useful when you need to be quiet late at night. As you may have read elsewhere, the midrange is forward which gives you the ability to hear every single unwanted noise. This helps you fine tune your performances, from scratchy guitar strings to unwanted breaths, knocks and thumps. If it sounds good in these cans, you have a good chance of making a fine mix.<br /><br />PROS: Great price, tough will last for years, comfortable, tight deep bass, can be driven by low powered DACS or iphones, isolate very well, excellent detail in the mids. Good for tracking when recording in the studio, great for monitoring audio from a DSLR. Sound a million times better than Apple Buds on iphone.<br /><br />CONS: Very little for this price. Their only problem being forward in the upper mids which can cause ear fatigue if listening too loud.<br /><br />Tips on using these to mix with.<br /><br />Don't listen too loud<br />Even though they are great for dialling in effects, trust the levels you hear on speakers.<br />Because of the forward mids be careful you don't get MID shy and lose punch in your mix.<br />Don't be shy to push the bass a little.<br />Though they are bright don't be afraid to add a little sparkle up top.<br />Don't get too caught up with adjusting balance or tone, it will sound totally different on speakers.<br /><br />I give these cans 4/5 stars only because I'm sure there are better out there but probably double the price. The other headphones<br />that are great for recording are the ATH M50s either one will serve you well.<br /><br />I hope this helpsreat for recording are the ATH M50s either one will serve you well.<br /><br />I hope this helps

They're very cute and given that they have a Mother, they're childish and full of curiosity. This is probably my #2 must watch on my list. Howl's Moving Castle is my #1

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Let me start out by saying that although I do like computers and tech-related topics, I was never a gamer.  I am not a video game fan.  I did not play role-playing games when I was younger.  Given that, I skipped over this book despite the buzz I kept hearing about it.  Finally, I gave it a read and was so glad I did.  I don't think I have been so absorbed in a book as I was with this one, I could barely put it down.  Although this book is heavy into the world of gaming, it didn't get caught up in esoteric knowledge or focus too much of incomprehensible technology.  In the end, this is a book about an adventure and friendship, not gaming.<br /><br />Cline writes brilliantly and creates characters that you can't help but identify with. RP1 proceeds with a spell-binding pace and builds a level of suspense that it very rare in modern fiction.  Sure, you could say this is just a silly fun book and not &#34;serious,&#34; but I think he touches on some important questions and presents a future that is entirely imaginable.<br /><br />Ready Player One combines the exuberance of young people on an adventure immersed in an alternate reality set in the bleak future (i.e., Goonies + E.T. + Matrix).  I really loved this book and didn't want it to end.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially the young at heart or those that appreciate an epic quest.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is just great.  It is very comfortable and works great.  It has such a great motion and play ability.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is a great family game. My grandchildren can't wait to come to my home just to see what there BABIES look like, see how much they are eating today. They love to work on the farm to see what they are going to plant this time. Keep up the good job GUYS, But it would be nice if the prices for things weren't so HIGH, but other then that it's a great game....

1423140605|5.0|In this book Percy Jackson meets up with Jason the Roman. They travel across the U.S. and also across the sea. They meet up with some forgotten heroes and meet an old legend that supposedly died.

B008EKOIN8|2.0|\\"Cooked\\" begins with a way over the top hyperventilation about the fantastic wonders of cooking and how the author claims it explains the civilization of humankind.  Although some interesting facts are deeply buried in all the lard, \\"Cooked\\" is far too overdone for my taste.  I didn't even bother to finish the Kindle free sample.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a good book. It was hilarious and it relates to what happens in my life. I look forward to the sequel
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Full of young talent and some great performances, I would have given this 4 stars until the end. Though they are slapstick and over-the-top, the characters are also believable. However, the resolution was rushed, and that left me feeling less than satisfied.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is a modern classic. As a mother, I felt a certain amount of sick despair as I trudged through the first part of it. And yet, thank goodness, the darkness turns to light as the story progresses.<br /><br />As a writer, I also felt a certain amount of sick despair as I read and reread many brilliant passages written from a young child's POV. This sort of writing could have been gimmicky . . . but in Donoghue's capable hands, it isn't.<br /><br />It would be silly to go on talking about Room. It's brilliant. It's one of the few books I'll reread. It makes me happy to know there are writers in this world as good as Donoghue.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|After reading (and loving) one of Milan's novellas, I decided to try a full length novel. It's good, but I found myself thinking that it would have been better as a novella as well. It seemed to me that the extra length was just sex scenes and I-can't-tell-the-truth angst (you know what I mean). (If you read romances for steamy sex, you probably will like this better than I did). The characters were interesting, the book historical, and the attraction clear. Overall I thought it very well done, but I might stick to her novellas in the future (there are a lot of them).
B0061QD82E|5.0|Bound for the Disney vault.  Periodically even before Walt Disney died, the company would put some of their movies in a \\"vault\\" and keep them there for years to supposedly make them more sought after when they became available again.  Before VCRs, DVD players, Digital copies, and super Internet companies like Amazon, that might have made sense.  Now it doesn't.  Someone at Disney is still trying very old methods to inspire people to rush out and buy a copy.  Personally I think they're idiots.  I was planning to buy the Blu-ray anyway and then they can jam it away as long as they like.  Should some children or elderly people not see it again because of their idiotic vault nonsense, it will only hurt the fans that have always held Walt and the Disney company in high esteem, and they will only make us think less of those in charge at Disney.<br /><br />P.S. Should I come back and haunt them when I'm gone? Walt may already be spinning in his grave.<br /><br />CA Luster

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great suspenseful look at turn of the century England. I did not expect the accident that claimed the life of Matthew.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did after reading some of the negative reviews and I'm glad watched it. Yes.. this has Faith and God as the vehicle of its message which is.. being responsible. After the death of a child a group of police officers take their responsibility of being a father to heart, and the trials that that entails. This is a message that weather your a believer or not ( I am ) is important especially in this day and age. It takes courage to do the right thing, especially in a society that has fostered the \\" Me \\" mentality. Every decision we make affects someone else weather we want to admit it or not. It takes courage and effort to be a loving husband and father to your wife and children each and every day. This is a Christian centered movie with a universal message,and to those that don't believe or are offended by that, understand this.In spite of the failures of some people professing to be a Christian, Christ's teaching towards women and children by their husband/father has no equal in all of secular society. This movie might not make a Christian out of you or like Christians more, but if it makes you a better more responsible husband/father than its purpose has been served.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A good read that pulls at the heartstrings.  Knowing that these atrocities happened to children is heart wrenching.  The ending was a bit abrupt but otherwise a good read.  Definitely recommend.
B00BMUYLSE|4.0|David Bowie hasn't changed at all in the decade he's been out of the scene. Now a younger generation will get to have a taste of his genius first hand. Bowie has added some new things to his bags of tricks when it comes to music making. His songs have modern mixing techniques coupled with old school flair coming from Bowie's lyrics makes for a very relevant album. after hearing the album through several times i couldn't help but think that  i would love for him to team up with How to Destroy Angels,Crystal Castles,U2,and Glitch Mob!

B000AOEMXM|4.0|We are about half-way through the second season.  The stories are fine, but no one in the cast has stood out.  It's a true ensemble cast.  Only flaw is T'Pol.  I simply don't like her stuck-up, superior attitude.  I realize she's playing to the era the show portrays and what the writers say to say and do.  But I still don't like the blank stare and pouty lips.  Of all the characters in the show, she's the only one I'd like to see eliminated by some alien attack.
B003UYV08E|2.0|A good action film has to have more to offer than just its hardware.  And though I risk being labeled a snob or, worse yet, an \\"elitist,\\" I would advise against anyone watching any picture that glorifies or otherwise romanticizes violence and weaponry. Violence is a part of many great stories.  But films that fantasize violence, obsess over firearms, exalt it, worship it--make love to violence like it was a thing of beauty--are true profanations.  To IM2's credit, the film certainly doesn't glorify violence.  To its discredit, IM2 really has nothing more to offer than its hardware.  The film-makers were clearly of the philosophical persuasion: If a little is good, more must be better.  They knocked their little heads together for a few minutes and calculated, \\"If a few IM suits in the original was a good thing by golly, lots and lots more will be a VERY good thing!\\"  But there's enough silly, redundant hardware in this film to make the viewing experience mind-numbing.  Evil Soviet scientist Vanko (Mickey Rourke) builds so many of his IM-like cyborgs that, at one point, our hero and Col. Rhodes are pursued by a platoon of evil robots.  Now, Vanko's dad helped Tony's father develop the IM power technology, and Vanko can build robots with the best of them.  But you've probably already guessed--and right you would be--that Tony and Rhodes handily outmaneuver and outgun Vanko's machines.  IM was fresh, self-deprecating, funny, and focused on it characters.  IM2 is the epitome of too much of a good thing--boring hardware overkill.  In the original, Downey was charmingly obsessive-compulsive, condescending yes, but witty and humorous, and that was fine fill for one picture.  In IM2, Downey maintains the identical modulation throughout so that, by the end, he becomes repetitive and irritating.  Don Cheadle, playing Tony's always-vexed babysitter, is a poor replacement for Terrance Howard, whose fine comic timing got some of the biggest laughs in the first film.  Rourke hasa wonderful screen presence (check him out in one of the best American cops and robbers yarns of all time, Year of The Dragon), and there are certain flashes of creativity such as Vanko's electrified whips.  But it's not enough to save this, as put by Amazon's Robert Horton, \\"genre foolishness.\\"  Sadly, at film's end you feel somewhat brain-devastated, consider for a moment all that money the studio will invariably waste marketing IM3 to you, and think how you'd rather spend the afternoon in a dentist's chair than see the IM 3-quel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These are the best books I have ever read. I have read and re-read this again an again, and nothing else can compare.
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|Cirque Du Soleil has always been amazing and flawless when I've seen them in person, and this movie is no exception.  But it's really just their Vegas shows filmed and pieced together with a loose story line.  I had hoped for a new show.  It os still amazing and enchanting.  The performers strength is awe inspiring and the costumes are breath taking as always.  I think if you have never seen a Cirque show in real life this is probably a good introduction, and if you've seen them and loved them this is a great reminder of why we love them.  I just couldn't give it a full five stars since it wasn't new.

1885167776|5.0|No one can ever expect to find \\"all\\" the answers when reading a book.  However, finding the One answer is all you need!  Gary Keller and Jay Papasan put forth a process to the finding the beginning point for every senerio you could be faced with (no matter whether it is business or personal) and teach us that breaking it down to just starting with that One Thing - can get you on the road to where you want to be and where you want to go!  Well Done!!

B007CW2FCA|5.0|The hype around Beethoven didn't start yesterday. It is a product of the middle to late 19th century, when musician began to have an inkling of just how revolutionary (artistically speaking) Beethoven had been: how he changed the whole conception entertained by western civilisation of the nature of music. Remember that Hegel, an exact contemporary, still doubted that music was an autonomous art form!<br />The consequence was, that his Protean power. so persuasive and yet so uncomfortable for bourgeoise sensibilities, was subdivided. We know all about his three periods, and so on. Interpreters more or less followed suit: after all, they made a living out of him. When Schnabel, in Harold Schoenberg's headline, \\"invented\\" Beethoven, he created a caricature. He did not invent Beethoven, he drove the craze for originality to a quite unwholesome peak. I wonder how people could take this seriously, but they still do. The point I'm making here is that you are listening to Schnabel the pianist using Beethoven's music a a tightrope for his own dancing. No-one followed in him in this attitude; and just as well!<br />But he succeeded in obscuring the fact that Beethoven's true style was rather better represented, in his own era, by Wilhelm Backhaus. Many people always knew this; certainly the Decca people did. In consequence we have, in these recordings, a cycle of performances that are sane, stylistically secure, eschewing any exaggeration for mere effect and remaining unruffled by the cries of those who can't do without varnish and/or pretence. Stephen Kovacevich once said, \\"Wilhelm Backhaus was the only pianist who really understood Beethoven.\\" I can go along with that.<br />It is true that Backhaus is inclined to relatively fast tempi. Hi approach to the early sonatas will not suit every taste. But strangely, they reflect the \\"classical\\" nature of these works much better than, e.g. Kempff, who is often represented as playing them to perfection. I doubt it. There is an almost hectic nervousness to his playing that make you realise that he (Kempff) is doing the exact opposite: dressing the composer up as a barn-storming young eagle with neither the wit of Haydn nor the melancholy elegance of Mozart, but somewhere in between, between two stools. Of these \\"heart on the sleeve\\" moments of rhetoric, Backhaus once said, \\"well, it can't have been all that much in deadly earnest!\\" Of course not: it was all play with forms that Beethoven would eventually break up, when he became Beethoven. So Backhaus is true to the metier, whereas others err in believing that they have to play as if Beethoven had foresight that he would one day compose a Waldstein Sonata (e.g. Arrau).<br />Backhaus is at his best in the mature sonatas. Let me make just one point, which is so important that we nearly always forget it. Any performer who plays just the notes, properly and with full attention on the markings and a genuine knowledge of how the composer's style fits into his own environment, can't go wrong. But I have just announced the hardest interpretive task of all. When you hear Backhaus play the Waldstein or Appassionata, you become aware that he adds nothing of his own to the notes: and now the miracle is, that the works are all the more eloquent for it. For once you actually hear the voice of the creator, not that of his interpreter! - I have always felt that the late sonatas, so tempting to pianists to overplay them, are majestic in Backhaus' rendering, especially opp. 106 and 111.<br />The recording quality varies a lot, from somewhat poor and dull to clear and translucent. Recording techniques changed over the more than 10 years of the making. The Hammerklavier was evidently recorded first; it is still in mono. Nonetheless, in terms of Beethoven playing, Backhaus has few rivals on his own level of greatness. Among younger players, only Gilels and Pollini reach a similar kind of consistency. Both those cycles are incomplete, and much as this must irk admirers of Pollini, he was better at it in his younger years. I for one am not keen to hear any more of his Beethoven after auditioning his two latest albums. Gilels is on the whole the best modern version, although he has a few quite eccentric moments (No. 13, No. 31). In short: as far as complete cycles are concerned, and assuming you are serious about Beethoven and not just sold on comparing the gimmicks of Mr X and Y, the Backhaus set is an investment for life.

B002N4DZ58|3.0|Always and forever \\"the tenor\\": Since Melchior's departure there seems to have just one with the voice to carry the part and the daring to delve into Tristan's paroxysm of despair and intoxication with the cursed brew of yearning for fulfilment and death.<br />At least two previous recordings with the stigmata of greatness upon them have been ruined by their tenors: Furtw&auml;ngler's Ludwig Suthaus seems to know as much as suburban shopkeeper of Tristan's soul; and Carlos Kleiber's Ren&eacute; Kollo treats the part like vaudeville, apart from which his technique is woefully inadequate. On the second rung, Bernstein's Ludwig Hofmann and Solti's Fritz Uhl suffer from the smallness of their voices - disastrously so in Uhl's case, who succeeds in portraying himself as a puppy dog to the imperious Birgit Nilsson. This leaves as the only other contender Siegfried Jerusalem, in Barenboim's set. His is a pleasant voice and capable of soaring; but its texture is evidently better suited to Mozart and one always feels that this is where he is more at home.<br />On this album there is no such problem. \\"The voice\\" is present and accounted for. Despite some signs of wear and tear, Domingo brings off the task of playing a Heldentenor with great aplomb; he still has a ringing top, plenty of strength and sings the lyrical passages with mellifluous tones. From this point of view everything would seem to be right; but there is a \\"but\\". It refers to his interpretation - if you can call it that.<br />One might think that a singer who has portrayed almost every operatic hero from Don Carlos to Kalaaf, from Siegmund to Don Jos&eacute;, would have the resources to do justice to Tristan. Well, yes - - but no. Tristan is an exceptional case. This is no operatic tenor: rather you might find an analogous case in the roles of Hamlet, or Ivan Karamasov, or even Hermann Broch's Vergil: men obssessed to the point of delirium, macabre, angst-ridden, fatalistic - something you have to be capable of understanding not just operatically or intellectually, but experientially. It is a dimension of interpretation that makes Jon Vickers' Tristan such an unsettling, searing, nerve-racking portrayal. He must really have lived through those torments. Nothing of the kind seems to touch Domingo at all; in fact his portrayal is a mix of all those operatic qualities that Tristan shares (depending on his present situation) with the heros of Verdi, Bizet, Puccini et al. But the specificity of Tristan, the passion that makes his blood seethe and his soul plunge into despair are elements so foreign to Domingo's genial nature that he ends up being simply a more classy Heldentenor than most of his predecessors. In short, his is a kind of \\"standardised\\" interpretation, or if you prefer, a kind of minestrone of the various histrionic components that have settled over the operatic theatre in its day of \\"romantic\\" glory.<br />If you are a Wagnerian whose forte is great singing, you may find this satisfactory. It is at any rate an improvement on the other tenors I have named, except Vickers. But Tristan is one of two principal roles. Some of the previous versions have also been spoiled by inadequate Isoldes. It is true that beside Flagstad and Nilsson, any Wagnerian soprano must sound like a lesser goddess. Possibilities never realised on commercial records are indicated by the partnership, in live performance, of Vickers and Nilsson, and formerly by Melchior and Flagstad (under Fritz Reiner!). Alas, our present soprano is no great shakes. Beside Flagstad and Nilsson she pales into insignificance. This is admitting that all the same she has a pleasant voice and is capable of surmounting the technical stresses on her voice. But as for interpretation, it does not have the stigmata of greatness upon it. She confuses fury with the anger suitable for a spoilt roast, and rages over a lost penny just as any other operatic soprano. Similar observations apply to the others; excepting perhapsRene Pape, who attempts with some success to step out of the shadow cast by his illustrious predecessors. But little of it really inspires - to stick with the truth, none of it. It's all more hope than realisation, more opera than the pitch black drama as which Adorno identified this work.<br />Which leaves the role or orchestra and conductor to be considered. These have always been of paramount importance to the opera. No wonder: the work is hardly an opera at all. As some stage performances including at Bayreuth have shown, you can almost do away with the trappings of the stage. The music truly reigns supreme, the whole work being more of a long symphonic poem for singers and orchestra. So the conductor's responsibilities weigh much heavier in the balance than anywhere else in the whole repertoire. This is clearly reflected in the assessments of critics who judge the success of a \\"great\\" Tristan production by the success of the conductor to blend all the various elements in a coherent whole. This, without doubt, is the reason for the supreme estimation accorded to Furtw&auml;ngler - although Karajan, with the benefit of a modern stereo production does not lag far behind. But all the great egos on the rostrum have shown themselves capable of producing a superlative orchestral canvas, though (to my mind) none more so than Solti, who seems almost oblivious of his singers as he unleashes an exorbitantly passionate, almost volcanic paroxysm of sound. The Vienna Philharmonic have to be heard to be believed. It is perhaps somewhat over the top, but for those reader who just want to immerse themselves in an ocean of glorious orchestral playing, this set must be considered.<br />Pappano stands at the exact opposite end to this. To judge from his conducting here, he has hardly an inkling of what Wagner's Tristan is all about. His conducting is attentive, alert and efficient, so is the playing of the orchestra. But all so small scale! So finicky, so elegantly polished, I find myself checking a wish to exaggerate - but somehow this is redolent of Mendelssohn or maybe Massent. Indeed, much as I hate to say this, Pappano is the greatest liability of this album. What would he (as a pianist) say about a pianist who played Liszt's Sonata in the style of the \\"Songs without Words\\"? But that is pretty much what he does here.<br />On that score alone this album is for Domingo fans. If you are passionate about orchestral Wagner, forget it. If you are hoping for a great experience of Shakespearean magnitude, forget it. This recording is no service to Wagner or to the public. Always excepting Domingo. But then, he is also not the perfect Tristan, not even the Tristan of modest dreams.<br />The sound is good, but somehow the aural perspective tends to reinforce my observations. It is all terribly small scale, transparent, clean and forgettable.ttempts with some success to step out of the shadow cast by his illustrious predecessors. But little of it really inspires - to stick with the truth, none of it. It's all more hope than realisation, more opera than the pitch black drama as which Adorno identified this work.<br />Which leaves the role or orchestra and conductor to be considered. These have always been of paramount importance to the opera. No wonder: the work is hardly an opera at all. As some stage performances including at Bayreuth have shown, you can almost do away with the trappings of the stage. The music truly reigns supreme, the whole work being more of a long symphonic poem for singers and orchestra. So the conductor's responsibilities weigh much heavier in the balance than anywhere else in the whole repertoire. This is clearly reflected in the assessments of critics who judge the success of a \\"great\\" Tristan production by the success of the conductor to blend all the various elements in a coherent whole. This, without doubt, is the reason for the supreme estimation accorded to Furtwängler - although Karajan, with the benefit of a modern stereo production does not lag far behind.

B0072OFOM6|3.0|Very fast delivery and delivered in great condition!  I was a big fan of the first season and the prequel.  I must say that the second season is horrible.  Very displeased, wish I had not bought it.
B00076OMW4|2.0|In order to write a sound review of this album, rather than just enthuse about negligible side issues, you need to compare this with Giulini's recording from the almost same year.<br />Giulini's account of the symphony is just as brisk as Reiner's, it has the same rhythmic alertness and vitality, and there is not much to choose in terms of recorded sound.<br />But I am extremely unhappy with Reiner's manner. He is cold, hard, driving his orchestra to play as if the devil sat on their neck, and in the result the performance sounds like an execution. There is no joy, no fire, hence no pleasure in this stone faced attack.<br />There is more pleasure to be had from the other pieces on the disc, but they are not the main bill of fare.<br />So to my mind this is not a satisfactory recording.<br />Least of all for those who want just one recording of this work, or those who are expecting to meet a \\"Classic\\" of the gramophone.<br />I have to add that despite the remastering technology, no technician can add warmth or youth to the sound that wasn't there on the original tapes.<br />No-one could possibly be deceived about the sonics being OLD, just like Giulini. Tape technology just isn't digital, period.<br />But, as I said, I would not cavil if the performance was wonderful.<br />But it is shockingly uncommitted to Dvorak's style, and fails to convince me that this a great symphony, and moreover one of the most beloved symphonies in the whole repertoire!

B001NLKT60|4.0|I think I prefer the first one over this one.<br />There are chapters that are VERY engaging and some other somehow are there to just &#34;fill in the gap&#34; between the others.<br />Overall I liked some &#34;twists&#34; and &#34;external&#34; references along the book. It is for the most part very much enjoyable. I just finished it this morning and as soon as I finish this review I will order the next one :D<br /><br />I read them in English since my Swedish is unfortunately still very shaky... there are some expressions that I feel are somehow lost in translation and I encourage you that you read in in Swedish if at all possible.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|This album is as hard and fast as any of the ones before it, and is miles ahead of their next one, 'March Or Die'! The production is smoother than before, but that does not reduce the heaviness at all. To complicate things, two of the best songs aren't even on the album! \\"Eagle Rock\\" and \\"Dead Man's Hand\\" were left off the album, instead ending up as the B-sides of the \\"The One To Sing The Blues\\" single. Buy this, download those other two songs, and skip 'March..\\", and you'll have all the major-label Motorhead you need!

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I loved this game. Only problems are that the help menu is anything BUT helpful. It gives you the vaguest of details about some of the easiest things you can figure out yourself.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Updated Oct 4:  They fixed the constant video ads that were plaguing the game.  Seems like things are back to normal.  Yay!<br /><br />Update Sep 16:  The constant video ads that they just put into the game make it unplayable.  Not only do I get a very annoying microsoft video ad when I launch the game, but I also get the ad every time I try to plant something, visit a friends reef, look at my vitality, look at my collection, etc.  It's nearly constant and a deal breaker for me.  What a great game this was, but not it's ruined.<br /><br />Very enjoyable game.  Beautiful graphics.  Addictive game play.  Quite soothing and relaxing.  For both kids and adults.  There are things you are able to buy to speed game play, but are not really necessary if you're patient.  As a parent you can easily put a block on buying things.

1400169445|3.0|It's always tricky business to review a book considered to be a classic. There's the possibility of genuinely liking it, but otherwise there's always the question of whether or not you're rating it highly because you feel you ought to or if you're rating it poorly because you're unable to properly appreciate it. (IE, that you're not smart or cultured enough to enjoy it.) So as a result you always have to carefully state what your opinion of it is in order to keep the worst of it at bay.<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't really enjoy this book that much and if not for the excellent narration, I probably wouldn't have finished this. The story here is good when you get down to it, but part of the issue is that it takes so long to get where it is trying to go. I'd use the term \\"verbose\\", if anything. There are some interesting parts, but after a while I just felt like it could've been shortened by about a fifth and not entirely lost much.<br /><br />There are some interesting characters here, but I'll say that the most interesting ones are the side characters such as Sargeant Cuff, Drusilla Clack, and Ezra Jennings. Their narrations are some of the better portions of the novel, either because it was during this time that things actually seemed to progress or because they were entertaining to read. It's hard not to crack a smile when you have Clack stowing the equivalent of Jack Chick pamphlets throughout the Verinder household! Some things are entertaining regardless of the time period, after all.<br /><br />I have no doubt that this will be the favorite book of some readers, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't read this again. Watch one of the BBC versions of it? Sure, why not? It'd be interesting to see this condensed down for film, as well as to see who was chosen to portray the various characters. But as the book itself? Nah. This just was too drawn out for me to really like it.<br /><br />This is sort of the type of read I'd recommend that people get at the library, as you're either going to love this or dislike it. I'd give this a slightly lower rating, but the narration is really wonderful so I'm giving it three stars.library, as you're either going to love this or dislike it.

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Paramore delivers with their forth studio Album! It's slightly different yet at te same time it's still Paramore. A lot of songs are upbeat & positive, and some like \\"Last Hope\\" are even inspiring and helpful to many.<br /><br />I love the fact that they decided to write a continuation of \\"Let The Flames Begin\\", as I loved that song. \\"Part II\\" is that continuation. It starts off with lyrics \\"What a shame we all remain such fragil broken things, a memory remains, butterflies with punctured wings\\". It's epic as I rarely see a continuation to a great song, let alone have it be as an amazing of a song as the first or even better!<br /><br />Paramore's music is getting better and better. This album is proof of that. The message in this album seems to be that life can be hard at time and you might feel broken but you're holding on and pullin through (you just \\"gotta let it happen\\") and remember that true friends stick around, those that leave were never really true friends.<br /><br />All I can say is BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't regret it!

B005S9EKCW|3.0|The costumes are great, the cast is great, the sets are great....everything in this movie is great. But it seriously lacks soul. The first half of the movie catches your attention with the opening number and the newness of these actors voices you may not have heard before....but after Anne Hathaway disappears from the screen, so does the spark of the movie.<br /><br />I am new to Les Miserables, but I am not new to musicals. Seeing a performance on stage with the orchestra pit paired perfectly is simply something that does not translate well on screen. The orchestra in this movie is really more of background noise, leaving the actor/actresses voice as the only musicality aspect of their scene....which makes it feel lifeless. I turned this movie off and listened to clips of the actual soundtrack from the 15th anniversary cast, and I was blown away. I was ready to write off Les Miserables as a musical I simply didn't care for, but I learned that this was really just another failed attempt at a movie musical. The only cast members I seemed to like turned out to be actual broadway performers!<br /><br />I would recommend renting this instead of buying it. It's pretty to look at, and interesting to hear the actor's voices...but that's it.

0765322889|2.0|I had completed reading the currently available books of the Song of Ice and Fire series and found myself drawn to read another fantasy novel. After extensive research into my next read I found Malazan Book of the Fallen to be the most popular of series in the genre by those who shared tastes similar to mine.<br /><br />The book starts out promising, strong turn of phrase and consistent character introduction, but soon quells all interest with its failed attempts at intrigue and discovery.<br /><br />Magic and Wizadry are far more elaborate in this series than in SOIAF. Numerous times you can find mages throwing glowing balls of magic at each other and it really seems the content is geared for children even though the dialogue is far more presented for adults.<br /><br />If you're more into the magical side of SOIAF perhaps you might enjoy it, but I failed to feel a connection with any character and the constant referrals to new sorts of 'magic' killed any mystery or interest I had in the novel.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|I have purchased a few of these for my Nikon cameras. They work okay. I know that there are other better remote or wireless options as well. I may explore that avenue if I start to make more and more videos in the future.

After an hour of the movie, it suddenly began to break up both audio and visual.  We had to scrap it and rent a DVD from a store.  Very disappointing.
030758836X|4.0|i loved this book, couldn't put it down.  it's well written, and the characters are extremely well developed. i also loved the plot twists.  I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because i was very disappointed in the ending of the book because it wasn't satisfying.  the author does such a great job of making you want a particular thing to happen, and then when it doesn't, you feel let down (at least i did).

B0002VFXFE|5.0|this super thick paste is actually easy to apply with a coffee filter. no problems so far so im giving this a good review.
0385344228|2.0|This was promoted as similar to Scott Turow's Innocent, which I enjoyed.  My problem is that the characters, though competently drawn, are all so unlikable that I could not bring myself to care what happened to them.  In scene after scene they annoy, frustrate, and carp at each other.  It's told in the first person, which should bring a nearly automatic identification with the main character.  Not here.  He persists in actions that are illogical and just plain wrong.  Greek tragedy has protagonists whose blindness induces them to a bad end; they are sympathetic figures with a \\"fatal flaw.\\"  In this book the protagonist is all flaw.<br /><br /><Maybe a spoiler:>  Further, there are conventions in this kind of thing, broken in this book: we expect that when we are told something, it will turn out not to be a deceit.  Not so here.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is capably written and plotted: it's not junk.  I just found both the characters and the story annoying and impossible to care about.

0385349947|5.0|Every girl over 18 and perhaps younger and every women under 50 should read this book especially if you are trying to make it forward in this man's world. Anyone over 50 is past where this book might influence them but maybe not. Women do need to stand up for themselves much more than they do in the work place. Do it with confidence and be nice but don't back down if you know you are right. I am a grandmother but supervised art teachers in a public school system. I made it much farther in my career than I thought I could but after reading this book I'm thinking I could have gone even furthur.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What more can I say? The movie is awesome, which is why I bought it on blu-ray. A/V quality is great and the added DVD copy is a bonus.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon had the lowest price I could find anywhere.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the Ultraviolet system since you have to be online to watch it, and have decent bandwidth too. But considering it's included anyways, it's not a big deal.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I do love bingo, and when I found this app for my Kindle Fire, I downloaded it.  It is a standard version of bingo, with a few fun add ons like power-ups and whatnot.  You have the option of playing through Facebook or as a Guest.  I am linked in through Facebook, which might account for the glitches.  It kicks you off, freezes and doesn't award you correctly at least once per play session.  You have a daily credit of 17 bingo chips, which are redeemable every 23 hours.  You can also win more, or buy them if you choose.  It's fun when it works, but it can get really irritating when you have good cards and it kicks you off and doesn't credit you appropriately.

B001NERPHS|5.0|This represents Dylan at a period of transition away from the Rock and Roll sound of Blonde on Blonde and Highway 61 to the Americana-roots sound of John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline.  It's also the beginning of The Band as a separate entity rather than Dylan's band.  (Many of The Band tracks are actually from later, not at the actual Dylan and the Band sessions.)  It's fascinating to see Dylan at the crossroads artistically as well as personally (This was recorded as he was convalescing from the motorcycle accident.)<br /><br />Even with remastering the album still sounds a little bootleggish.  It's not a major issue, though.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I had seen this DVD once before and watching it a second time, I got even more out of it.  It answered a lot of questions.  I highly recommened this DVD to everyone.  There is always more going on than it is possible to be aware of.
B001GF5KDK|4.0|this band is better than slayer, heavier than slayer, and more talented than most of the other thrash bands that demolition hammer was competing with in the late 80s to early 90s. this is a good album with lots of good riffs, excellent drum work and (fast) double bass!! the vocals on this aren't as good as they are on epidemic of violence but still this album kicks ass. fans of slayer, creator, Sodom, destruction, sepultura will really enjoy!!
B001R3YRG2|5.0|This movie brought back a lot of memories of a time gone by.  I love watching and listening to all the extras that come with the DVD.  Michael Douglas does a great job talking about making this picture and why he was drawn to it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|the dark knight featured the most classic and biggest nemesis for at man and the story, actors, all made for a great thriller. this time the storys antagonist is bane. true to the comics we see bane breaks batmans back. this story for me wasn't as enthralling as the dark knight. it was chaotic and dark, but something was missing. its a shame that Nolan is done with batman, i really enjoyed his vision of bruce wayne. i applaud his decision to not include robin, robin always seemed to take a lot of the seriousness away from the story, making them goofy. if you like batman get this!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Based on Shakespeare the tempest only in a sci fi setting, The iconic C57D and Robby The Robot how can ya go wrong. I've always thought the vibrant colors in this movie were awesome. I gotta say just looking at Leslie Nielson cracks me up. Great sci Fi Classic so break out the popcorn sitback and enjoy
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I had never read the book so I can't compare to that but my husband kept saying, &#34;that's not like the movie&#34;.  I liked it but I was ready for it to be over by the end.
B000002KK2|4.0|I can listen to this album for hours.  Rickie Lee is quirky but fun.  I had this music<br /> on a cassette tape back in the day and just thought it would be good to hear her again and it is.
B003D0E3FM|3.0|My husband likes these old time sci-fi type movies so we rented it. It was pretty good for what it was. It is fun to see what they have to represent future technology.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I am so happy that I found this music.  Eric Burdon and the Animals were one of my favorite groups in the 70's so I was very interested when I saw that he was releasing some new music.  So, I purchased this new music along with some of his old stuff and I am so glad I did.  I am very much enjoying the new along with the old.  There is just something in his voice that sooths my soul.  Also the band is great!  Thank you Eric, I love the new music as well as the old.
B006S8QY8K|3.0|It was ok but not much of a story. Typical chick flick. Worth renting just to see Richard Gere try to dance.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|What's with all the permissions? I really wanted to try this app but the permissions are to many. Don't think this app needs  so much access.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD was rated one of our Most Popular Diets of 2012. Michaels packs a powerful workout into just thirty minutes that contains the core components of any successful workout routine.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I finished this book in what I assume was record time! I am an aspiring author myself and thoroughly enjoyed this book as I fell in love with Holder, right along with Sky, or Hope..whatever.  :). Colleen is literally the most gripping, descriptive, and edgy author I have read and I am amazed at the works of this book!!!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I simply love her music! She is hands down one of the most innovative musical artists. I definitely recommend seeing her live, it is an amazing experience.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4
0307010856|5.0|I was so excited to get this for my granddaughter.  When my children were little I would read this to them *dramatically* :D
B002KGEORM|5.0|This show was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4 more.
B0024F08RO|5.0|Awesome season. I love prison break so I had to complete my collection. Couldn't be happier. Will watch over and over again. Great price.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I saw the 1st season on regular tv and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4 more.
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|I think it's not bad as others preview. I like those music and they are cool. I would like to give 5 stars to this !
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best thing that ever happened to me. I really like this but it is to awesome for me<br />Awesome love it
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun for all ages and I like that there are different games you can play under fruit Ninja.  My son also loves this game.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|To be honest i wanted to play a game online but the said i needed this app  i think it is<br />Weird having the app because it is not the best
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Im not much of a reader, but all of my friends were raving about how good these books are, so I read them. The first one I read in about 7 days. I admit some of it had me thinking... WHAT AM I READING?!?!?! But i got through it. Bought the next two and have to say the story line was much better!!! Ive been finished for about a week and Im missing Christian and Anastasia!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book grabs you, right from the start.  I felt like I was stuck on Mars, I just couldn't stop until it was over.  Very short synopsis:  An astronaut is inadvertently left on Mars.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a little too \\"sciency,\\" assuming that's a word.  But I decided to get over it, the story was just too good.  I read this several months ago, but I still find myself thinking about it.  Just get it, really.  You won't be sorry.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved the book it keep me up all night. This book is full of action and a little bit of drama
B00AJER3SE|4.0|Now, the Terminator is a classic. I remember the time when I watched it for the first time and I couldn't stop watching it.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|Chris Potter has so brought us a deliciously-played, truly haunting melody that my imagination saw myself strapped to the deck of the boat hearing the siren original song. iTunes, required me to buy the entire album to get that one 8:38 Sirens song, but it was well worth it for me, since Sirens not only stands head-and-shoulders above the rest of the album, but head-and-shoulders above most other instrumental music I have heard. I rarely buy music for others, but hearing Sirens convinced me to buy the CD from Amazon to send to my brother who loves listening to Jazz.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|As a 80's arcade kid, I think that this is the best movie of 2012.<br />Lovely characters and really good plot.
B001DEXDNI|5.0|I love the music that this artist has created and the amazing talent of her vocals is what isolates her as one of the best artists of her time.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie Nelson is the nature Texan descendent of the great Texas/Western Swing bands of the 1930s and 1940s. This album is a timely reminder of the eclectic influences of classic country music.<br /><br />We have swing/jazz standards like \\"Let's face the music and dance\\" (made famous by Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole) and \\"You'll never know\\" that are up there with previous Nelson visits to such material as \\"Blue skies\\" and \\"Stardust\\". \\"South of the border\\", a song done by countless artists including Willie himself before, is very charming. Reaching further back in time is the 1920s Blind Lemon Jefferson blues song \\"Matchbox\\", a song Jerry Lee Lewis recorded in blues style as well. Western Swing is represented by a cover of the 1930s Moon Mullican/Cliff Bruner hit \\"I'll keep on loving you\\" (which was written by another Western Swing legend, Floyd Tillman) and \\"Shame on you\\" (Spade Cooley, Bob Wills). The French song \\"Vous et Moi\\" and the Latin tinged \\"Nuages\\" further add diversity to this great collection). Highly recommended.
B0055S348W|1.0|I used the test program and it worked with my printer but when I purchased the complete program it doesn't communicate with my printer. I have a Lexmark X7350. It uses X73 drivers which this program supports. Now I'm stuck with paying for a program that doesn't work. I'm really disappointed. If you have a similar printer, I  wouldn't suggest you buy this even if the test program works.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|To sit on a friday night with your family and order pizza, this movie not only gives the family a good time, but it's very very educational. The kids had alot of fun and learn many things about Bees and animals and life in general. Defintiely recommend this to anyone looking for a worthy movie, it's actually surprisely good!
0062080237|5.0|This book only gets better and better as it goes.  That is impressive considering how excellent it starts out!  Buy it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|So easy to use, I love this cover. Although  it is a bit heavier than some others , I feel it gives more protections. It is a  very soft leather.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|great game.  actually worthy of the $2 price.  makes you really think.  great design, can not wait for more rooms
B006LSZECO|5.0|Rarely do I ever yell out while reading a book but this one did the trick. So many \\"Holy S***\\" moments. I'm still sitting here with my mouth slack. Ok it's over. Jeez.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book just fine, it didn't wow me. The cousins added a little twist to Nicholas Sparks usual style of writing. The main elements of the plot were particularly predictable.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Really enjoy finding out about friends and seeing pictures of grandchildren. Seeing other friends family PICTURES and news. Helps me to keep in contact .I really love facebook.
1250027624|5.0|Beautifully done!  This is an amazing book that brings Downton Abbey into your home even when it is not available on TV.  This was purchased as part of a work related project and now I want one for myself!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It was great then gave it to my grandchildren and they loved it also.It really kept our attention THOUGHT it was about time the whole family could watch the same movie and not  Be worried about them seeing anything they shouldn't'.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I love everything about Harry Bosch. Living in the L A area brings all of this to life for me!
B00005JPD0|5.0|This movie was awesome!<br />Anything with Denzel Washington is usually good<br />Made in New Orleans and that's my home town<br />Loved It!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Erased it though since my Kindle Fire is almost full and it is one of the apps I used least,
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book was an easy and entertaining read, well written, and it inspired me to accelerate my journey to declutter.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|My husband and i really enjoyed this Movie!With a smart plot,plenty of nailbiting suspense and action,some surprising twist and turns that we did not expect and the acting was good as well.Brilliant and highly recomended!
B0014NDXGA|4.0|works well, easy to use.  Makes a difference to have the exact yardage to the pin. Did not use the slope feature.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A great story in so many ways. Really worth my time. The type of book that I'm still thinking about weeks after reading it. So good that I'm reading funny excerpts to my kids from both this book and \\"Point of Retreat\\". The poetry is so touching. Colleen Hoover is a very talented author. I bought some Avett Brothers music and I'm loving that too. It's a wonderful feeling when a book adds something to your life. Can't wait to read \\"This Girl\\" and anything in the future that Ms. Hoover wants to write.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|CGI is really well done, great acting and production job.  Sound and quality picture outstanding, 3D effects are great too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's not to complicated and all my friends and family LOVE it we think it's great as you can play it the car,plane,boat and train as you don't have to tilt it all I have left to say is its AMAZING !!!!!!!!!#keep it cool
B00433TO52|1.0|An earlier reviewer had warned me, but I hadn't thought the missprint problem could be THIS bad! And I really did want the apocrypha. I must confess that at the time of writing this review, I have read only one of the plays -- ARDEN OF FEVERSHAM. It's a play I know pretty well, and admire greatly; but from this printing ... gad! Had I not already known the story, I would have found it impossible to follow! It reads as if retyped by someone to whom English is at best a second language, and as if nobody had ever proofread it at all. Of course, if that is indeed the case, they should be congratulated for occasionally getting a speech or two more or less correct, whether or not assigned to the right character. I have not yet dared to attempt reading any of the other plays.
B0012GTZFC|4.0|I chose to read this book as part of a class I am taking for my masters degree.  Its a nice quick read that, in my opinion, helps clearly define a catagory of leadership based on language and behavior.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|gave as a gift and it has held up well to the abuse. Hello kitty is her favorite item to have and she will take it with her everywhere.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Good game to play to waste time when waiting for the dentist. Not much to the game, but it is a son of the gun to land on the carrier!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The story is great but the problem is the graphic sex scenes. I really want to know who ends up taking over the throne. The second season doesn't have anywhere near as much nudity or graphic scenes, and has more story and I liked it better. You just have to deal with the sex in season 1 to get to the place where the story gets good.
B005LN5UOC|3.0|The headset is the most comfortable on I have found and the microphones is really good at canceling background noise in my house I just don't like that the buttons are a little hard to press and that the earloop is not able to be switched for leftys
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I find that the iOS app is far better in terms of allowing font changes and more line spacing options.  Also, with the newer 1080p android phones (HTC One) the margins are much too wide.  Left justification would be easier to read as well but even that's not an option.  Strange that Amazon would let this app be so mediocre.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This easy, yet perfectly programmable clock has never failed me. I sleep soundly knowing I will receive a perfect wake-up call. Set several alarms for work-week, week-end, special occations and forget it. Like to wake gradually or do you need the rude awakening? Doesn't  matter this app can do it. I highly recommend it for the ultimate Kindle Fire user.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it helps me keep up with my Bible reading and it help me with day to day Bible studing,  I take it with me every where I go.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|One word. PERFECT. This is my first review because this book was review-worthy. This book was amazing and i could totally relate. When it ended, all i could say was &#34;THATS IT?&#34; i didnt want it to end!<br />it was perfect just like eleanor and parks love.
B005PK57IK|3.0|The ensemble is still very good, but the back story has meandered unnecessarily, for which the writers have tried to compensate by increasing sexual tension and content. Not sure if I will watch the 4th season.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy play even for fat fingers the vivid tiles are easy to see for old eyes. Game play is also easy.<br /> .
B0000CABJ1|5.0|There are SO Many great songs on this CD.  I was lucky  enough to find one that has one of her 12&#34; singles on it.  I really love this CD.  Donna Summer may be gone from us but we'll have that voice and all of her amazing songs forever.<br />Bill S.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's free and that's a good thing. After a few times of playing it enough is enough. I'm sure the kids like it more than I do. I don't think buying the full version would make a difference for me. We tried emailing/faxing the recordings we made and the recipient couldn't make out the words so where's the fun in that. I will most likely uninstall it. Sorry that's just my opinion.
B00C6PWC4Y|5.0|I am very pleased with this Ken.  There is a great new look to the face, rooted hair and top quality clothing / outfit and shoes.<br />I have several 50 + year old Ken's and a variety of them that have been made over the years.  This new line is very nice and a great addition to my collection.<br />Bill S.
B002APU580|2.0|I couldn't even watch the whole thing. It wouldn't load, and it wasn't my connection. When it did play, it was only for a few seconds and then it would stop and load again. A 24 hour rental wouldn't have been long enough to watch it anyway.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This is a really great CD.  The variety of artists that she does these duet's with is amazing.  A few you wouldn't think of or imagine Barbra Streisand pairing up with.  A great choice of songs too.  Another &#34;PERFECT&#34; Streisand Album  !!!<br />Bill S.
B00AFOS6P2|1.0|I'm totally bemused by all the good reviews of this album. Nick Cave is a great songwriter and the Bad Seeds are a great band, as is Grinderman, but this is like the Boatman's Call without the actual tunes or ideas, or like Nocturama without the two good songs on it. I knew we were in trouble when he put his naked wife on the cover of the CD. To my ears it is bland, boring and I am really missing Mick Harvey and Blixa, something I have never said before. I'd say that Cave has finally jumped the shark but he's jumped back and forth multiple times since the late 90s (remember his Gospel of Mark period?) so I am just notching this one up to another mid-life crisis. My criticisms are: a lack of standout tunes, a lack of obvious melodies, a lack of interesting instrumentation, a lack of the Dionysian, and a surfeit of the same types of lyrics he has been writing for years without any attempt to move it on. I'm sure in a few years people will be less fond of it, or maybe it's just a dead end for me and a few others. Hiho. Good luck, Mr. Cave, hope the next one is better.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The best of the 3 of this title I have seen.  Would buy item for my sisters and friends.  I watch this movie often as I love the characters and actors.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I listened to a pdf document and found the speech to be pretty accurate.  All my kindle downloads did not show up.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A very well researched book about a subject that has, for a long time, been misunderstood.  I thank the author for bringing this to forefront of discussion.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I like the fact that this version has many other books within it and from the same author, it makes it easy for readers to have a complete version in one package
B004EPYZT4|5.0|The quaility of the movie is great & the little extras always a plus. I was never a fan of the original Conan, but happy that I have this one in my collection.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great strategy game.  It is very easy to learn.  Good for all ages (probably 6 and older)
0783225857|5.0|The quality of this DVD on an up to date flat screen is amazing! This is such a classic movie and I'm so happy it's now part of my collection!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I started playing this game 5 months ago and reached lvl 75 so far bc I love this game, I look forward to playing it daily, could use a little work and do something about lost credits because it freezes. Other then that, it's the best bingo game I have ever played
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey has proved to be a drama series with few matches. The acting is high quality, the setting highly authentic, and the story line is intriguing. The characters are of a variety of personality types and with suficient depth to carry the ups and downs of the story.<br />There is just enough suspence to keep you watching, and while learning a bit about that point in history, keep you rooting for the good guys.<br />I would encourage anyone, young or old, to sit back and enjoy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is very good it is the best game I've played Disney has done a awesome game  the best I've played!!!!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Great music, it is great to see someone still creating and producing solid stuff after such a prolific writing and singing career.<br />Amazing!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Plays well on a tablet using Android Jelly Bean OS. Has slow action until you get used to the controls and then you can control the speed and skill level that is comfortable .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most funniest and entertaining horse game I have ever seen I heart this horse game it's awesome.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great from begining to end. Loved it. I think tere are alot of this goes on thaat we never here of
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I use this to wake me up, and indeed it does! I set it every night and you have to make sure the volume is up or of course it wont wake u up. My favorite part is that you can wake up to your fav. song!  :) so I recommend this for an alarm clock hope this helped!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Trouble with the last 20 minutes of viewing. Kept going off, then I would get message that it was taking longer to download then normal, please exit or try again
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|This was a romantic and refreshing movie that just happens to be a true story.  It is so nice to see that in real life romance is not just in books and movies but happens to real people.  Just loved this movie.
1452110581|5.0|This book was so funny. We could imagine our cats writing it. I think any cat lover would like it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Surprised that hubby liked it, as he loves blood, gore and tons of actions. This was a sit on the edge of your seat suspenseful movie, even without all that. Ben Afflick did a great job.
B00B8PMWJI|1.0|So bad...I can't even begin to describe how bad this movie was. There were SOME good ones, one or two great ones, but most of them were stupid and/or gross.
B004TN7QPG|1.0|I ordered this app and can't even download it.  It doesn't even shown up under my apps or in my cloud.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Alright, I had a lot of issues with this movie. The one I noticed right off and annoyed me throughout the entire movie was how freaking dark it was! I couldn't see a damn thing! The lighting was awful! Most of the acting was over the top or just indifference. The movie was choppy and I feel like there were a lot of elements missing for the movie. I get it's  a horror movie and they want to build suspense and not make gore porn but they showed like nothing! I feel like I watched a bunch of nothing. It was an empty movie to me.
B004UPALT6|4.0|There's a reason this is a cult classic.  Funny, spooky, funny, silly, macabre, gory, funny.  It's the movie that put Campbell and Riami on the map.  If you want a fun party, watch Evil Dead, E.D. 2 and Army of Darkness in order.  Glad to hear they're re-imagining the Evil Dead franchise with plans to unite Ash withe the herioine in the new movie.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I enjoy plot doesnt need gun fights and car chases.  I like characters a sign of good story line and good actors
B001TW69J4|4.0|Weightless is better, but this album is amazing as well. Tosin has a true talent and it reflects on these albums.
0440238153|3.0|It was ok. The ending was kind of a big let down. THe books overall were OK, I was just hoping for more.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, if you remember the late 70's it is fun to think of what homes and what people wore at that time. I did think the ending was a little much but you have to believe in these kind of movie, that is the fun of it. The only thing that surprised me was the language that the kids had...there were some times that it was a little surprising...don't remember anyone that age saying some of that...but it was a good movie, worth seeing.
0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut, as most know is a fantastic writer, with a very unique style of writing. I bought the book for a class at the University of Iowa, where Kurt Vonnegut attended the famous Writer Workshop. Great novel and I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|My son downloaded it on my kindle and so I didn't do anything with it.  Not much of a gammer..
B0015DWLD0|5.0|Our entire book club loved it.  Talk about a page turner (or should I say a forward clicker).  I also appreciated the interview with the author.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I also have this on my i phone. Really like this!  Seems to do the trick and takes care of my phone...
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I usually hate musicals and i'm not a big fan of the generic rom-com.... but, for guys out there, this one isn't terrible. Worst case, you'll enjoy seeing Workaholics's Adam DeVine. It's not quite Mean Girls, but extremely tolerable for what it is. Having said all that from the bf perspective, if you're a girl who likes romantic comedies based on highschool/college and like musicals, you'll probably give this 5 stars.
B0063GORYU|5.0|For being the free version it works really well. I can play as many times as I want and the ads only pop up once before you start the game. Overall I have fun playing this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of spider solitaire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it can be addicting and really fun I think people should get this if they like Temple Run I love it I could play it till I die that's how much I love it!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have used this DVD for 3 months straight and I have only lost 8 pounds. I do have better endurance, but I am not \\"shredded.\\"<br /><br />Granted, I started out the video with a lot of experience and have a consistent workout routine... So, this is part of my daily workout but it doesn't live up to the hype in many cases
B008LP8QE8|3.0|The book is great, BUT the search option is WAY too slow. The only fast search option was with the pocket guide, but the format in that book is horrible.  Purchased both but ended up returning them. going to try the Apple iBook version.
0375842209|5.0|This hardly needs another review - I'd just like to add my congratulations to the author for his work and the different form of narration. At times I wondered if it was a little undisciplined, but overall it's a good story that will remain with me.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for the birthday.. She love it.  We play it all the time..Can't wait to see for their next album.
B001L4NJIO|2.0|I chose two stars because I like the Police. Otherwise, the pixilation and the dropped audio for minutes at a time was frustrating. This varies from player to player. I thought it was my player, then tried it 5 more. Worked OK on two, believe it or not off brands. Samsung, LG and Sony had problems playing it right. Two insignia players it worked fine. Anyway, 50 bicks for a blu ray and I want it to work. Unfortunately I waited too long to bring this up to the vendor because I thought it was my player, so that's my own dang fault. Because my results may not be typical be sure to check return policy and be ready to play Bluray in a few different decks. Good luck.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought it was challenging and very rewarding. It was a little short but I will definitely buy the next one.
0143106651|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who is majoring in English Literature to add to her library of classics. Lovely cover illustrations. Would make a beautiful, classic gift.

0061743526|5.0|Everyone should have a copy of this book in their home. This edition is a beautiful reissue of the original.
B0055PMURG|5.0|I always enjoy a movie inspired by a true story! I love it that the gril had faith and was real with the frustration of the VERY UNFORTUNATE situation. Regardless, with faith and support (lots of it) she pulled through and what an example that can be for all of us! One can only imagine if we were in the same situation if we would have been so positive. God bless her!
034580404X|5.0|When I purchased this book, it was because I saw the Picture of the Trilogy box with the Note &#34;LOOK INSIDE&#34; on the Amazon<br />site while browsing for something to read.  So I looked inside, became curious, and felt if I didn't like it, it could be a throwaway<br />set of books.<br />  Did I mention I am a guy?<br />Books arrived.  How did I know that 1/2 the female population in North America (and possibly the world) was reading this? I went<br />to Costco and the lady working in the food court (age 60ish), thru the gate said, &#34;How do you like it? I'm on book 2! Wow!&#34;<br /> My wife's cousin visited that weekend; she has 3 daughters.  She said, &#34;That book must be good all my daughters are reading it? What's it about?&#34; I said, &#34;If they didn't tell you yet, I better not, and let you ask them; so they can surprise you.&#34;  She is in her mid 40's - daughters 19 to mid 20's.This same event occurred with my wife's best friend and her sister, the first mid 50's and<br />second mid 40's.<br />  I could go on like this all day, however, if you haven't read it by now I am surprised. It seems like Harry Potter for females.<br />I must say I had plenty of sex. Glad the S/M didn't go overboard.  And am I ever glad to see he got a great female - though where<br />he ever found one like her is only in ones imagination.  Also found it great that they were able to stay together and work toward<br />one another as opposed to most couples, unions, marriages today - the going gets tough - the skittish leave!!!!<br />  Lastly:  Something was portrayed here which I believe occurs all to often, but is never brought into the light.<br />  That is the sexual violation of the adolescent male - who not infrequently becomes a lesser image of the hero of this<br />book though, likely not a handsome nor as rich.  Likely becoming violent as he becomes older to other women because<br />he now believes all women should adore, love, etc. him.  Everyone is worried aboutsexual victimization of the female -<br />I contend that there are at least half as many males who are sexual victims of assault willingly or unwillingly as there are<br />females.<br />  Anyway, as for this book.  Very interesting as given there is caring as well as the matter of exploration of deviance and a<br />reasonable ending - it is a good dirty book.

0547884591|5.0|For those expecting a traditional cookbook, you will either be disappointed or pleasantly surprised. While there are recipes, the book is about more than cooking.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book!!! Couldn't stop reading!!!! Just the right blend of action and emotion. Can't wait to start the next book in the series....
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I love JT as a person but I've never been a huge fan of his music, only liking a couple of his songs. This album had so much hype yet I find it extremely disappointing. The songs are long and actually quite annoying. Very repetitive and poorly written lyrics. Some of the songs had an R&B feel while the others were pop-ish. I felt like this album was just a disaster and I would never choose to listen to it again.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a complex plot full of fantasy and action.  The story of the relationship both between people and man and nature make the story both interesting and meaningful.  The animation and voice actors are excellent.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game. No scams it is absolutely free, you don't have to wait an eternity to get items. And coins are easy to collect. Really great game!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Loved the movie! I bought it new because of the digital version. BUT you have to open and activate 2-5new accounts, sinc them, and could never get the two sites to match up and sinc. Also I could never see the movie on any device. Maybe I am digital challenged, but it shouldn't be that hard. Also the customer service from UltraViolet sucked
B0041KBWM0|5.0|What a beautiful period piece. Lovely storyline and visually appealing. Would have liked to have seen more of this story expanded.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was recommended to my by a fellow blogger Edee Marine Fallon (check out her blog at My Book Addiction ). This book was remarkable in every way shape and form. I never knew a book could make me feel the way this one did. I laughed, I cried, I was built up, I lost faith in humanity, but in the very next chapter that faith was restored. My emotions were run through the ringer, and it was amazing! I read this book in less than a day, as I simply couldn't put it down. As soon as I opened my e-reader and started reading this book my world drifted away and I was instantly thrown into Sky & Holder's lives. The topic of this book is one that can be hard to get past, and may hit a lot of us very close to home. However, if you stick with it I assure you it is extremely rewarding.<br /><br />The characters in this book are extremely well written. Sky is very believable as a character and you really can't help but love her, feel sorry for her, and in some ways wish you were her. Holder is another story. From the beginning I wasn't entirely sure how I should feel about him. He seemed kind of aloof, but I could tell he wanted more from Sky, but I wasn't sure what. I wanted to trust him, and I wanted Sky to trust him. After reading the book, I can completely understand why he was the way he was.<br /><br />The most refreshing aspect of this book is the way the love story is written. Often times two characters meet in stories like this and its love at first site. That's not the case with Sky and Holder. Sky often doesn't quite know what to make of Holder, and she finds herself slowly giving him pieces of her heart. I can't tell you how many books I have read where the author has pushed the characters to fall in love so quickly that you don't get a chance to know who the characters are independently. Other authors have a tendency to draw out the flirting only to realize that they are getting near the end of the story and they have to push the characters together to quickly. These are the more infuriating types of relationships written. But Hoover doesn't do that with her characters. You can honestly see them falling in love one page at a time. PHENOMENAL!<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I loved this book. I will recommend it to everyone I know, and has now gone on my must read list.These are the more infuriating types of relationships written. But Hoover doesn't do that with her characters.

B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I couldn't put down my kindle! The descriptive style of writing is so vivid and draws you into the prospect of new possibilities and another world fraught with egotistical megolomaniacs.The characters unfold dramatically as does the realisation that the author is making an impassioned comment on social structure and our present world's value system.

0393307050|4.0|The author makes you feel as though you are on the ship and in the battle.  His choice of descriptive language is excellent.<br />However, there were many instances of  terminology use that only an experienced mariner could easily understand without some effort to further clarify the meaning to a landlubber.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|The DVD is perfect.  The buying experience was easy.  What's not to like?<br /><br />I only wish the producer had put in more out takes and Easter Eggs.  I'd buy this again.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|This was a surprise gift for my kids, who are late fans of the show. They loved it, I loved it, and the quality of the DVD's was perfect.  No complaints.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I enjoy playing it. The levels get harder as you go on and it really is rooted in Star Wars, from the back ground music to the graphics!!! Fun....
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Overall this product does the job - my Core i7-950 Bloomfield runs nice and cool now. However I'm not completely happy with it for two reasons:<br /><br />Installation - the included documentation left much to be desired. In fact even though it was in something like 32 languages it was almost useless. Fortunately there are YouTube videos that are very good at walking one through the install process.<br /><br />Included Fan - The fan that came with it (there's one although some product pictures show two) is dying after only 34 days. It ran quietly enough for the short time it was working properly but now it is emitting an increasingly consistent grinding noise as if the bearings are wearing out. I'm searching for a replacement now. It should be easy enough to swap out but I expected more than one month of service out of a brand new fan.<br /><br />This thing is also huge, I had to slightly modify the side panel of my Antec Nine Hundred case to accommodate it. The specs and pictures of this cooler didn't hide the fact that it was a massive beast so I knew that going in, no stars knocked off for that.<br /><br />I'm soon building a new rig and am considering a liquid cooling solution. I am going to replace the fan on this cooler and keep the rig it's on as a backup but given the poor quality of this fan I don't know that I'll buy any more Cooler Master products.
0545259088|2.0|Normally I don't go for werewolf stories.  I think it goes back to the trauma I experienced as a teenager, watching American Werewolf in London at a middle school band \\"lock-in\\".  That film spooked me for weeks (or possibly months).  Since then, the closest I've come to enjoying any tale with these mythical creatures would be when I read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban many years ago.  However, when the volumes of The Wolves of Mercy Falls series began to be published back in 2009, I was intrigued by the buzz and positive reviews surrounding them.  I won a copy of Shiver in a contest and actually enjoyed this first segment. The next title was Linger, which I didn't enjoy quite as much.  Less time was spent on the plot, and more was given to Stiefvater's poetic and flowery style of writing.  Still, I wanted to finish the trilogy, so I pushed on to the final chapter, Forever.<br /><br />To say that this book frustrated me was an understatement.  I enjoyed the story and the characters, but Maggie's propensity to constantly insert metaphors, similes and hyper-descriptions really began to annoy me after a while.  There were times when I literally was shouting aloud, \\"Oh give it a rest, already!!\\"<br /><br />I'm sure there are many who enjoy this style of writing, but I find myself in a different camp. Descriptions are fine in order to set a scene or a mood, but in this case, the purple prose just rankled me as the chapters wore on.  Whenever Stiefvater focused on her characters and her narrative, I found it interesting and compelling. I just felt that she got carried away too often with her artistic framing.  She is a very talented writer; I simply am not a good match for her work.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This IS simply a great app for my business and personal use.  It's simple to use and has just enough features to make me run from all those paid apps.  THANKS for the app it is great...
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I expected to have a problem with Daniel Craig in the role of Blomqvist after two James Bond roles, but I think he is perfectly cast as Mikael Blomqvist . I also like Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth better than the Swedish version, even in the full Swedish series. I wish the producers of this movie would continue (and complete) the trilogy.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Bought for my four year old niece...she loves it!  Nice buy....glad I went with this Lego set.  Hope others like it.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Interesting book written as if she were talking to you. Some like he can see you from the pages. Or on my iPad camera. Ellen is very funny. This was a good escape read.  It took me over 6 months to finish but is was my I need a break read. No I didn't have it in the bath room. I read at least 3-4 other books simultaneously.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If u loved 50 Shades of Grey u will definitely love this. It is a really good read and quite detailed so that as u are reading the book u can picture it as it happens. Deserves all 5 stars*****
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|Firstly thanks to folks reviewing here, you drew my attention to this amazing musician. Intriguing, unique, entertaining, humourous yet musically crafted with care. Very enjoyable, one of the better CDs I've listened to lately, nice going Kurt.
1439127727|5.0|I am not a history buff, nor a huge non-fiction fan. However, this book is so well written and full of interesting historical insights that I looked forward to every chance I had to read it.  I loaned it to my dad, who reads a lot of nonfiction history. I know he will love it because the insights are unique.
1451695195|5.0|I could not put down this wonderful book.  The fact that it is written by a man of science makes one take his account quite seriously.  Highly recommended!  Loved the surprise ending!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|great game better than the others combined<br />you need to get this app there is no way you could make it better!
B003N5VOUO|4.0|This film is memorable and important. The acting by SRK and Cajol is superb. If only it were a little less violent and absent the sexual innuendos I would have my children watch it as well. I imagine the movie only barely scratches the surface of how Muslim/Sikh/Hindu Americans were treated after 9/11, or how the event affected their lives. It also shows the many struggles adults with Asperger's Syndrome might face. The movie is able to draw the viewer into the lives of the struggling characters very well.<br /><br />One large drawback of the film is the various scenes, perhaps intending to indicate New Orleans in the Katrina hurricane disaster, depicting an African-American community in the South. The depiction is ridiculously inaccurate verging on offensive, but the intention of the Director is well understood if you can get past the stereotypes. I would give the movie 5 stars but for the depiction of the African-American community.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for the next room! And the one after that and the one after that...  Please hurry up!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I didn't see the endgame until the end. A good read with good characters and a believable plot that kept me turning the pages.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'm not sure I can say I liked it but it held me to the end.  I would have liked a little more info about the country in the aftermath of the events of the books.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|This is a return to Cave's Boatman's Call style album. Strong on piano and gorgeous looping melodies which capture your heart and crumple it between his talented fingers. This really is his forte and I welcome the fact that he's escaped the shouty punky phase in some of his recent albums. Lyrics as ever are sublime and poetic.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have 3 kids that play this game on my Fire. They are almost 4, 10, and 12. They fight over who gets to play. Thanks for creating a game that all these ages can enjoy.
0062068423|1.0|This is a WWII novel trying to pass itself off as a modern novel. The story spends most of the time in the past and is so boring that I couldn't follow it. If I wanted a a book on how bad WWII was, I'd read a book on that not a mystery.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I was surprised at how addictive this building game was. The characters are perfectly representative of the Nemo movie.<br /><br />The play is instructive but it's almost impossible to complete all the challenges without spending real $.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|ITS actually pretty cool but the don't give you enough time:(  Just buy mincraft pe its the same thing&amp;its got better items. common how many words do you have to put
B0055S348W|1.0|This product worked perfectly at first purchase.  It has recently been updated and will no longer find my printer.  Worthless waste of money.  I strongly suggest they add the ability to connect directly to a TCP/IP printer.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Been a while since I read this in high school, it's much appreciated now for some reason. I love her transformation from beginning to end. Just wish she would have made it, had s great long life, and share more of her writing with us. Live on through The Diary of a Young Girl Anne.
0307277887|3.0|I didn't realize I had pressed the &#34;convenient group package&#34; button and when I got one package, I didn't check the box to see if the book had come, and bought another one out of frustration. When Christmas came, it was a laugh to see that I was now an owner of two copies.
0439023513|5.0|I finished this book in two days.  Like all the other books in the trilogy, this book engages you right from the beginning.  I would recommend you read this as well as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  They definitely aren't just for teenagers.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie and I'm glad to have bought it. I just wish it would have come with a soundtrack CD as well.

0062080237|4.0|A new elemental force is rising in modern society, the gods of technology and modernity. They are pitted in stark shades to the archaic gods of the old world, gods like Thor and Isis. Into this clash of new and old esoteric currents is thrust Shadow, a man troubled by the grief of losing his wife and his hard-scrabble life as an inmate. He's a disturbed anti-hero, one who seems to be figuring out where he fits in all this, as he rambles across the country with a god named Wednesday. We wonder whether this is some sort of metaphor for humanity today. Are we all in a sense Shadows, trying to synchronize different cultural elements, both old and new? The clue to the message of the story might be in Shadow's name itself.<br />Though the premise for the novel is innovative and brilliant, I only give it four stars because, at times, I felt the writing slogged and became non-descript. One other small gripe I have with the novel is that the gods in the book are portrayed as more nefarious and less numinous -- numinous being something I decidedly like.<br /><br />M.P. Gunderson, author of The Ajnir
B0042LJTQO|5.0|Brendel can be mechanical in some collections (like Mendelssohn), but in his Beethoven and Schubert collections you can hear not only his technical proficiency, but also that he is emotionally involved in the music.<br />This collection and his Beethoven collection are my &#34;go to&#34; discs when I want to listen to excellent solo piano work.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great adventure - fantasy movie.  For children or anyone young at heart who enjoys something besides the current offerings of sex and violence; this is an opportunity to drift into a different world and just enjoy it.
B00061QJZI|5.0|5/5 because of sheer laugh-ass-etude<br /><br />Some small parts not very funny but then quickly another joke comes in<br /><br />Makes you wonder how awesome the sequel will be
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved all the old video game bits. As a kid growing up in the eighties and nineties it was fun to get little flashbacks of the games I played when I was a child. Very cleaver animated sequences.
B004I654WQ|5.0|Everything was great.  Received it quickly and in the as-promised condition.  I knew my son would love it and now it's just about the only thing he wants to watch.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Pretty handy little app, let's me access my desktop from anywhere in the house.  Really responsive, and represents the desktop quite clearly. Highly recommended.
B008GAXUGW|5.0|Boccherini is a joy. I recommend this edition very highly. You will not be disappointed. Most of  his work is cheerful and happy. His Chamber-music is profoundly  affecting.

B00908DDZM|5.0|I will admit that I am somewhat bias since I am a Seattlite. However, this album is on it's way to becoming legendary. Not only do they represent the culture of Seattle impeccably, they have no qualms about ruffling any feathers. The only down side is that there is some very heavy subject matter (e.g. Wing$, Same Love, & A Wake, to name a few) that can be hard to listen to repeatedly but songs like Can't Hold Us, Thrift Shop & White Walls are much more lighthearted. I applaud them for putting out such quality songs without the help of a major label and for the honesty Macklemore pours into his lyrics. It is definitely quite a contrast to the typical rap album as far as content goes, I would compare him to Kanye West but only in the way that they both tackle issues that are very taboo. I highly recommend the album, I love it and I'm stoked to see Seattle get some love again.

B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and agreed with most of the other reviewers.  These police officers because of the times did not have the resources of course that police do today. The characters all blended in well with each other. From Mickey Cohen's girlfriend to Josh Brolin's wife, the women who starred in the movie were great as well.  Sean Penn, excellent! !!!  He made you want to beat the hell out of him yourself!  The clothes were wonderful on both the male and female actors.<br />It is was not a modern, war of technology like most of the cops and bad guys we have today.<br />I would recommend this movie.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|Most of these CD's are not playing: poor quality, avoid buying the set: Bought as a gift, and just garage CD: better off buying them 1 at a time.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|We have truly enjoyed reading & then watching the Harry Potter series.  We've taken a break as our kids are only 7 & 8 and the subject matter (kissing, attraction, etc.) is getting a little ahead of their maturity level.  But the first 3 movies have been fantastic.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I'm late in finding this series. Just started watching Season 1 last week. So far I love the characters and plots, hope it continues to be this good.
034580404X|5.0|Interesting read! I recommend purchasing the set as you will want to have the next book in the trilogy available as you read thru the set.
B0063IH60K|5.0|enjoy this game a lot, find myself playing it all the time really relaxes me when I 'm stressed out
B008FYZIVY|2.0|The first season of discs played perfectly.  The second season discs are defective.  There is nothing on them after the lead in material.  Which by the way is BORING, not nearly as pleasing as the First season lead in with the antique bell ringing.<br /><br />Anyway, If I knew how I'd return the set.  I can't even purchase a season two by itself.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|What more to say, great movie to watch and entertain the kids as well. Whats not to love. Great buy
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This films dwells on the 13th Amendment and some reverse stereotypes which are uncomfortably common in movies these days. However Daniel Day-Lewis is beautiful in the title role. Well cast, well acted, bravo!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Beautifully written and presented in the first person by the protagonist, who just happens to be a dog!  A lovely story about love, loss, betrayal, perseverance and the joy of living.  You need not be a dog lover to enjoy this book, but if you are, so much the better.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Good software, but I think that the User Interface could be better. It's necesary improve the computer skills and append the two major expansions (Inns and Cathedrals, Traders & Buillder)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good show. Didn't want to wait for Netflix and I missed some episodes on Directv. I give both the show and Amazon's instant video download service five stars.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|It worked as promised a few times, but now there's no sound when the alarm goes off. Yes, I checked all the settings. Bummer. Kept trying different settings and times for over a month. I really wanted to like this app!

B00B8WXFWE|5.0|nkotb have a great album in '10.'  'the remix (i like)' is one of the most dynamic pieces of ear candy i have heard from any artist in a long time.  i dare you not to dance in your seat or just jump up when it comes on.  it's hard to believe that the songwriters are european as these songs are so tailor made for the group and as joey mcintyre put it, speaks to where they are in their lives now.  it's great to hear songs about love and relationships from a group of guys who can actually sing!  these songs are infectious and beautifully rendered.  i have kept this cd on repeat in my car for over 2 months.  it's a fantastic accomplishment in pop music to have so many great songs on one cd without cursing and vulgarity.  these dudes let you know they are fully grown without getting in the gutter.  i had the opportunity to see them for the first time on 'the package north america' tour in june and i was blown away by a fabulous show.  true professionals who make it seem fresh each night and never miss a step or a note.  notice there is no scandal associated with these five bad brothers from boston.  they love what they do and they show it in the way they respect their fans.  i hope, no matter where they land on the charts this time, nkotb keep on doing what they do.  i bought 'hangin' tough' for my then 6 year old back in the day and i gotta admit i found the tunes nicely arranged and well sung.  so, now i am introducing nkotb to my 6 year old grand daughter, 25 years later. she is a fan as her mom still is, and now, myself. hangin' tough indeed!!

0525958002|5.0|I was twelve years old and only two rows away from the stage when I collapsed at my first Duran Duran concert. Nick Rhodes with his bright orange hair and glittery sweater, actually glanced up from his keyboard.  His concern only made me scramble to my feet, bloody elbows and all, and scream harder.  A couple years later, my uncle who knew a tour organizer, gave me backstage passes to Power Station.  But my sister who came with me because I was still too young to drive had just had her wisdom teeth pulled and the meds they gave her made her throw up.  We had to leave early.  By the time I attended my third Duran Duran concert I was older, so much wiser, and was curious to see just how close I was to the stage.  So I took my shirt, not the one I was wearing but the tour shirt I'd just purchased with the faces of the band members outlined in neon, and wadded it in a fabric ball straight at John Taylor.  It was nearing the end of their final encore and I can remember him stretching the t-shirt out on his way offstage, looking for some message, a personalized photo, something.  But there was none except that I was just another senseless, faceless, female Duran Duran fan.<br /><br />So now as an adult, both a professor and writer, I was anxious to read John Taylor's memoir.  I don't count Andy Taylor's memoir because to me he and Roger were as interesting and integral to the make-up of the band as a pair of bookends.  My attention was always focused between Simon, John and Nick.  And, as it turns out, they really were the creative minds behind the music.  They've also been the most loyal to the band.<br /><br />Taylor's memoir itself is told in snatches of chapters which obviously read quickly, almost too quickly.  Certain events and conversations are glossed over.  For example, what exactly was said between Taylor and Rhodes when they were disagreeing about the direction the band was taking near the end before the brief time they broke up?  A little dialogue and scene would've helped to dramatize the moment.  A good editor might've pointed that out.<br /><br />Some of the in-depth relationships Taylor had with important women in his life are only superficially defined.  Being a girlfriend on tour with her pop star boyfriend must come with a whole other kind of baggage, and I was interested in hearing about the emotionally weightier parts.  I was surprised in a good way that Taylor did not spend the entire book recounting all the women he slept with, although he does list quite a few, even some of the ones whose names he doesn't remember.  The bulk of the book consists of interesting antecdotes like the time he, Nick and Simon stole back something they felt was rightfully theirs in the broad light of day, from I believe it was their former managers.  He writes about being a part of Band Aid, his constant and eventually collaborative run-ins with Robert Palmer and other musically minded stories that distinctly separate his memoir from that of other self-aggrandizing musicians.  After all, when it comes down to it, sex, drugs and rock n' roll really are cliche'.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|very addicting. makes you use your brain at a fast pace! stayed up really late on this one just as good as bingo
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|We were talking today about what it would be like if Jimi was still around. With all these 'old' groups on tour, Hendrix would surely be out there with them.<br />Satriani, Bonamassa, Vai etc have taken Jimi's techniques an dimproved on them.
B00023B1A8|5.0|This is one of the best of their music....I actually had a VHS that I wore out until it snapped. I now have it on DVD and this is actually my second one, I loaned the 1st one out and never got it back....I guess they liked it too....The Best....
B00B23O96A|4.0|as always, excellent guitar playing by possibly the best ever. Never get tired of listening to this guy. Can't wait to see him again.
1416583432|5.0|The book came quickly and in excellent shape. I enjoyed the book very much. As a pet owner I found it interesting, well writen, and a fun read. I recomend it, even if you don't have a dog it is insightful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics were amazing. I only wish the game was longer but looking forward to the next game if they make another.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Great concert. Cant stop watching it. Why I bought a new guitar. Learnig Black Dog, my favorite Led zep song
B005ZUR724|3.0|This game can be very fun. It is also difficult at times to get a group to do the fun dungeon aspect which seems to make the game. Pretty poor story line not much to it just basically grind quests till you are capped then you do group activities, if you can find the people. Had a pretty poor experience with the servers crashing and trouble logging in not very well maintained, this continues for weeks at a time before or if it gets fixed. Bottom line is if you don't make friends the game is not fun solo, it is a mmo accessible anywhere that is what makes this game get the 3 stars from me.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|One of the best listens in years.  Especially the previously unrecorded tracks.  I spent two weeks listening to it in my car.  The book alone was worth the price.  What great photos and commentary.  I would recommend this to anyone, even if they aren't Stills fans yet!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie.  It was really well done, and the emotion that is portrayed throughout it is unmatched by any portrayal of this story that I have seen.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|In the vein of Gone Girl.... it was mesmerizing to piece together the mystery. I Read it in one night!
1400069807|5.0|Michael Moss delves deeply into the world of processed food and uncovers, not only how our food supply has changed over the years, but also how we ended up with the obesity epidemic and general health crisis in this country.  His research and sources are impeccable.  Even for someone like myself, who as a nutritionist follows this topic, this book really lifted the curtain on exactly how things have gotten to where they are...bad for consumers!  If you read this book, you will have fascinating conversation points to discuss for years, and it might change your life!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had me page turning furiously trying to figure out what was going to happen next. A great read but a quick one since you cant put it down
B000N6TX1S|3.0|I was disappointed to find that the movie was just in a slip and not the actual case. I don't recall seeing that it wasn't in the proper packaging. The pictures showed the DVD case, and so I was a little upset. But I still love this movie
B0041D843M|5.0|This is truly the most comprehensive study of nutrition I have ever read. I am in the process of changing (eliminating) some of my poor eating habits and plan on becoming vegan by the end of the year. I'm so thankful this book was recommended to me and am recommending it to everyone I know.
B004MC0FO8|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle fire.  Could not even download to my Kindle.  There was nothing said that it wouldn't work.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Pro:<br />-Added grip<br />-When used, makes the game much more enjoyable to play (monster hunter)<br />-Compatible with North American 3DS XL<br /><br />Con:<br />-Used in some games (metal gear solid 3DS, kid icarus, etc)<br />-Stylus becomes inaccessible<br /><br />This isn't a necessity, it is god's blessing.
B00BHMF578|4.0|We rented this through Amazon Prime. We are glad we rented it. It was a good movie. We could see why it won all those awards. I would highly recommend watching it.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Simple, yet it does everything a hangman app needs to.  For the talented, try not solving the word until your last &#34;life&#34; - you'll get a variety of amusing animations.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Good action and storyline. Tough guys all around make it a fun movie with plenty of shootin' and great gunplay
B00AQCMK32|5.0|$2.50 for this is a no-brainer. Having knowledge of which consoles sold well and kept market share irl helps a lot.
B008MUIVBU|5.0|I really love my new crocs.  The band over the foot was a bit tight at first, but I stretched them a bit (using my hands) and now the fit is great.  Very comfortable.  They look good with shorts and I've worn them shopping, biking, etc.  with no problems.  My daughter has the same pair and had the same problem with the band over the foot, but I stretched hers for her and the fit is fine now.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this in 2 evenings. You can really feel the characters emotions and you definitely get to know the characters. The chapters were pretty short and easy to read. I definitely recommend this book!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Even though this game has Nemo in it, it is soooooo much fun. It isn't really a little kid game like most people would guess that it is.
0810993139|5.0|My daughter liked the movies,so she began to ask for the books.I was not sure she would put forth the effort to read the books,but I was pleasantly surprised to see I was wrong.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it I cannot explain how amazing I am into the fifty shades book. I'm looking forward to read the second book. Of fifty shades. I was wishing I'm Ana in that book haha
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|It is ok.  I like to print and I found that it does not  let me print. I have to write and sometimes even then it doesn't let me finish my word.
B007W8S2MG|1.0|excited to get this game after all the good reviews but in the end this game is garbage. There is a lack of explanation and I regret buying this
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!! its so much fun!! reminds me of when I was a kid at the fair. I  loved the pay loader game I would recommend this game to anyone ! great game!
1401207529|5.0|If you don't have this trade you must pick it up. This and year one are hands down the best of the Dark Knights storyline and what make Frank Miller the author of choice.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|My daughter ordered this series and has enjoyed it tremendously.  She is very happy with the quality of the product.
B001EN71CW|5.0|1st off one of the best series EVER. That aside, I was a bit hesitant to upgrade from my regular DVD collection ( which we still have for collection). So... It's 2013 and this is STILL one of the best Blu-Rays out there, for extras, sound and visuals. This and the movie really show off your sound and TV like no other.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Dull.  You'd think- hey, animated film!  That'll be good for a laugh!  Maybe three in this one.  And then you see Johnny Depp's name and it's like &#34;Well, he wouldn't do a bad film.&#34;  He didn't do a bad film- just a mediocre one.  I wouldn't really recommend it for young kids, either, and i don't think older ones would be interested.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG AMAZING it is so easy to play like I didn't need eny help in the beginning with moving side to side going under the trees or over the fire or anything else like that! So EPEC u should try it!
1568814518|5.0|Eric Gjerde makes tessellations look really easy. The book shows how to fold, make and use tessellations. It also explains how to use the different papers and what papers to use. I made my first real tessellation on the same day I received the book.
B005HSL626|5.0|I enjoy this game - it's sort of like a shooting gallery, but with fruit.  It also requires skill in not hitting the mines and bombs.  Very easy to play (all options) and fun to watch what happens on screen.  Also, very clear about whether you want to spend money, or not.  You can still play and have fun without having to spend anything more.  Great fun!!!!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Trilogies rarely deliver more answers than questions in an episode. The formula is set: first episode sets up the characters and conflict, part two develops character interactions and ends when conflict climaxes, finally, the third brings the end of the climax/conflict and resolves the series. Entertaining? Yes. Groundbreaking? Well, it depends who you ask. There are similarities to films such as The Running Man (1987), Battle Royale (2000), to name a few, and it revamps cliche roles one such is of black actors as saccharin mystics a la [&#34;The Legend of] Bagger Vance.&#34;
1591842697|5.0|Everyone can benefit from maximizing the underutilized form of drawing to communicate. Differentiate yourself by wowing associates with your proposals and conversation skills.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you're into horses, this game is super fun and very accurate! Not difficult to play and you don't HAVE to purchase in game items to progress. Love it. Even as an adult. ;)
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson did a masterful job continuing on Jordan's legacy.  It was an action packed adventure that sought to tie up all the loose ends.  Sad to think that the Wheel has stopped turning for these books but I couldn't think of a better ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it a seed for you is i like pizza  dig down at spawn. The language of mia sent to the world and the Tory leader in the first to you are not want to have the right to watch a movie about lynching fetch Greg Norman mailer the green poop made of people who are in a black house and other than one person can handle
B000J6I0PM|5.0|if you are a foo fighters fan it is a great rendition of their classic songs. a way to hear different styles and sounds of sounds you have known for years
143353083X|4.0|I love all the information in here, and especially the access to the website!  However, if you are over 40 - make sure you have your bifocals!  There's so much crammed into this &#34;personal size&#34; bible, that the print is uncomfortably small.  If you're a kid - go for it!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have never liked indie folk music in my life more of an old rock person. But these people are just amazing. Their voices, songs and everything are beyond words. Their music is wonderful especially compared to the crap today. Deff a fan for them and a big one. Everyone should give them a try.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I find it interesting. The plot works well and a recovering Sherlock Holmes is a good twist.  NYC is always a good setting.  Watson is a girl... That should be interesting toooo...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Something my daughter wanted. She played part 1 and was curious about part 2. She told me that she liked it and thought it was different.
0399245030|4.0|We love Oliver Jeffers' books. They are simple with amazing stories. My son loves Penguins so this is a natural addition to our book shelf.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Wow !!!... I'm lost for words. I cannot believe such a little and cheap gadget can make such a world of difference in sound quality.<br />I happen to know my phone (Samsung Galaxy s2) does not have good audio output to begin with. But I did not really know how bad it was until I put these on an compared the sound quality. It's like night and day.<br /><br />I use the Klipsch Reference One headphones. Finally it's getting the audio input it truly deserves and it sounds fantastic. It is happy and I'm very happy... :)<br /><br />Highly recommend this product.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Saw the show in Seattle. Breathtaking! Man!<br /><br />Sade does it with so much style, grace, confidence and intimacy!<br />Superb staging, lighting, sound and showmanship. The show, from start to finish is not only a feast for the eyes, it's a sexy,<br />sultry, seductive, orgasmic assault on the ears.<br /><br />Sade Abu, long the perfectionist and singing only when she has something to sing about, after a 10 year hiatus, shows us all<br />why her LP \\"Soldier Of Love\\" (Debut at #1 in the U.S. and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks) produced a sound and feel that<br />made every one want to see Sade and Co. in concert after a 10 year hiatus from the stage as well!<br /><br />With sold out shows on the original legs of the tour and the success of the LP, Sade extended the tour to Australia adding<br />dates, with a final show for this tour in Abu Dhabi making this the band's first WORLD TOUR and rounding success!!<br /><br />They performed in front of over a half a million fans, many of the dates sold out in a tour that grossed over $53 million.<br /><br />The 2011 concert dvd/cd combo debut at number 1 in the U.S. as well! Making Sade the 8th highest grossing tour of 2011.<br />Now, this tour will have to do for now...no telling when the reigning queen of pop/soul/r&b/jazz and rock will get around to<br />treating us to another LP and Tour? Get your copy now!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I couldn't put it down one of the best books I've read! Highly recommend to anyone who loves a good romance!!!!!#
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is awesome on of the best games i have tried on the market the great thing about it is that it is free and you will absolutely love it and have an addiction, this game also has incredible graphics and runs great on my galaxy s3 with no lag problems at all i absolutely recommend this game to everyone out there trying to find a new game for their android phone or table. Androd 4 life yeah!
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|If you are looking for the definitive version of the Original 1933 Classic, King Kong then look no further.  The sound and picture are perfect as one might expect from blu ray and are discussed in other reviews but the special features are what is truly amazing here.  They paint a vivid picture of the making of Kong with interviews that lead you through the entire process of making the film.  There is also a great piece involving Weta Workshop that recreates the stop-motion process of bringing Kong to life.  Beautiful!<br /><br />The book piece is filled with beautiful color illustrations and interesting facts about the film and the time in which it was made.  It says a lot about the film that during the darkest part of the depression people still lined up and paid their hard earned money to see this film and not just in this country but all over the world.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and pick up this little gem and enjoy the heck out of it..RIGHT NOW!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Has a lot of action with a plot is worth your time spent watching it. Overall story builds some not enough to loose track or get confused from episode to episode.
B008VSIAN2|5.0|Great album from a great band - can't wait until they release their next album.  New lead singer was excellent
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Funny movie that hits close to home of what many of us have seen or experienced in our lives finding comedy in the pains of our experiences.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how great this movie is. I recommend it 100%. The cinematography blew me away. Ang Lee did an amazing job!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Needs more ways for gold and a dragon battle option<br />But all in all it is a very fun game to have
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|She loves it, I do miss buying albums but I guess we have to go with the times. JT puts the ladies in the mood, go get it boys!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The grandchildren love this game and it is fun to watch them play, the graphics are adorable.  But be sure to keep parental controls on at all times or the in game purchase options can become quite expensive.
B008476HBM|3.0|This is one of my favorite books to read and so I got it for my kindle library. However, this version does not finish. It skips many pages at the end of the novel and so it is not complete and if you have not read this before, it will be very confusing.
B00BAYLQI0|1.0|I don't understand the fascination with this film. The first few minutes were okay, but it became incredibly boring about 10 minutes in. I hoped for it to get better but it never picked up. One of the worst movies I've seen in awhile, and I've seen quite a few duds lately. Skip this movie and save yourself two hours of boredom.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|The ColorMunki helped my photography work tremendously.  After using this, you can tell if your photo lab is accurate or not.  It has helped me rule out certain places, and helped prove others.  Very highly recommend, if you don't like surprises when you pick up prints.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book from beginning to the end.  Can't wait until the next one.  She always surprises you in the end
B003L77G6A|5.0|i am glad i ordered as many episodes as i did. still waiting for the 6th episode to view at home
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love Game of Thrones, and Book Five doesn't let you down! Such a breath of fresh air after wading through Book Four.
B0053O89WY|5.0|i am glad i ordered as many episodes as i did. still waiting for the 6th episode to view at home. get o ut of here. why on earth am i adding so many words to a review
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Obsessed with the Game of Thrones books!  But number four is boring, introduces too many new characters and plot lines, etc., but I'm sure Martin will reintroduce them in Book Six (whenever it comes out)!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Nothing was wrong. The case and all the DVDs were in great condition. I had no complaints. Great show! Wish it was still on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wish the ending wasn't the way it was, but otherwise really enjoyed the book.  Good story and character development.  Love that she makes you love and hate the characters equally.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE MINE CRAFT ITS SO AWESOME I'M 11 AND I LOVE IT I PLAY IT<br />24 HOURS<br />I LOVE BUTTER aka GOLD
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game it is so good and it is cool on portable I am getting it on xbox 360 soon. Love the game I would recomend it for anyone.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Absolutely love the new Dr. Who series just as much as I loved the first batch (though I didn't come to the show until John Pertwee, but have been a fan ever since). The writing, the acting, and the technical aspects of the new Dr. Who are nothing less than wonderful, especially for a TV show.<br /><br />This particular doctor is not my favorite, and in many ways I am glad he was only around for one season, but he was still very good, and the adventures he and Rose go on are splendidly creative and well-written.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|The original DVD and blu-ray were extremely washed out and lacked contrast.  This update greatly improves the video quality.  The two different 5.1 audio tracks are also a nice touch.  One is the theatrical mix and the other is a mix created for listening at lower volumes or in a smaller room.
0517548232|2.0|The one lesson is very slow until he gets to the point. (if he ever gets there at all) There are better out there
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Took me a few listens to get into the entire album - but I absolutely love it. One of the best voices out there - still !!. This record is so diverse. They are still one of the most influential bands around. Excellent record
B007REV4YI|5.0|I liked it a lot, but for me the villain being able to escape endlessly got to be a bit tedious !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!!  Could not put it down!!  Thank you Nicholas Sparks you are an amazing author!!  Now to do some housework that I have neglected!
B002X3V4P2|3.0|This is a HUGE track list for a modest price. Unfortunately, it wasn't until I heard all of Enya back to back that I realized how similar all her songs sound. Great for a taste, but not a whole meal.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I have it on my Google tv ,all my android phones (5), my tablets , and as a surveillance camara. I love it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci introduces a new character, Agent Robie, an assassin for the USA. The book is a good read with lots of twists and turns.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app.<br />I really love it. It is fit for kids of all ages including me! , love this app.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I bought this set of cd's for my daughter, wno is a big stones fan.  She loved it and so did her college age son.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|PRODUCTION: 4/8<br />LYRICS: 4/8<br />CONTENT: 3/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 3/8<br /><br />This weak and human-like, what does not being human have anything to do with anything?!?!<br /><br />PROS<br />- a few highlights of humourous lyrics and clever tidbits<br />- some variety with some rock inspired beats<br /><br />CONS<br />- minimal to no substance<br />- no sense of cohesion or purpose<br />- production is lacking; at times simplistic and under-produced
B00338QENI|5.0|This book should be a &#34;must read&#34; for high school students.  It was amazingly informative and oh so interesting.  The fact that this woman lives on, for scientific study, is just amazing.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Works fine.  Did not include the AC charging plug.  I had old white one but white unit was not available. So black cord and white plug.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are my first proper headphones and they sound amazing! Great bang for the buck! It has a spectacular sound stage, good oomph in the low frequency (bass) and sounds quite balanced. I am no audiophile but I like the quality of the sound it produces!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books made me see my life in a whole different way. I just love Susan Collins way of writing.
0061992860|5.0|I've read many guides. I find this one to be well organized and very good when it comes to illustrating and detailing how to actually do the various techniques. I would recommend for experience and novice survival people.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|For the price of this unit it is really doing a great job, used it on a few videos so far with good results.
B000H7I6CU|1.0|The movie was not in Spanish like it said. I was very disappointed when i played it and could not change the language.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I did give 2 stars because it was an ok storyline it just didn't go far. I am shocked at the reviews this book is getting. I have not saw the movie and I am really considering not seeing it. I normally read books with high ratings and almost always they are a great read. Not this book I found myself skipping paragraphs because I feel that it was repetitive at times. The football was too much, very boring and I scanned over most of the football parts because I got tired of reading.  How Pat talk/thinks in the book is very childish and I understand he got out of a mental institution but really???...It was like he was a 5 year old. I found the book depressing in my opinion. I did finish the book because I hate to not finish one that I start, I am glad it was pretty short because I was ready to move on to something better.<br /><br />UPDATE-JUST WATCHED MOVIE: Way better than the book actually enjoyed watching and the movie made Pat more like an adult with issues realistic.  Wish I had skipped the book and just watched the movie.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|One thing you will feel as soon as you play this album is that there is rarely a part of the album that is jarring or too contrived. This is a free flowing album but not without purpose. All the songs are well crafted and the musicianship is controlled and well synergised. It's like a jig saw with all the pieces fitting well together to create a wonderful tapestry of songs (not great but wonderful).<br /><br />There is no great effort to fight the ghost of Ritchie by creating some great riffs (something I feel Steve is not a natural at) but creating some good music and I feel that the band with Bob Ezrin in tow have been able to do that..<br /><br />As everyone will have their own interpretations of the songs I'm going to cover them broadly. The two earlier songs released as a single in March are the extremes of the album i.e. the most AoR (All the time in the world) and the riff anthem rocker (Hell to Pay). Most other songs fit somewhere in between these two.<br /><br />The first song `Simple song' is a slow Steve guitar start to a good solid rocker; `Body line' is the swinging one with a nice intro jam and sexy overtures in Ian's lyrics. It's quite catchy. `Wierdistan' and `Out of hand' are as Geoff Barton puts it free flowing jams connected loosely but at the right places. Both songs are lovely specially Out of hand.<br /><br />`Above and beyond' has simple lyrics that will get you to imagine a lot, I suppose it's about continuing to love someone beyond the boundaries of life on this earth.<br /><br />The hot rock here is `Blood from a stone' a deep voiced song with some fantastic ethereal work by Don on the keys (reminiscent of The Doors) and undoubtedly the hardest edgy guitar work by Steve Morse in Deep Purple, the song is done in two tones and stands out as a real gem, this one could end up being the rock song of the year.<br />`Uncommon man' starts with wonderful rich guitar work by Steve (he is really fantastic here) and then the band joins in for a free flowing brassy number about `good to be king'.<br />The five old hands have done a fine job and the sixth' Bob' the producer has helped them smooth the edges to make the music richer, plus all the instruments have their own space giving greater depth. This is unlike `Rapture of the Deep' where the sound was quite muddled. Both Don and Steve have interesting passages in the songs that add great feel to them ......a bit like the old times ha ha. This album is probably one of the most progressive by the band.<br /><br />This is not Deep Purple of the seventies but again it's not in the shadows of them either. As said earlier this is not a great album but I have to admit it's a wonderful album and will leave you warm and glowing.<br />Nowhere during the album I felt that the melody got lost and the song should have taken another direction possibly to make it better, ok maybe once with the lyrics of `All the time in the World' as in `I put my faith in the axle not the wheels, Like old Zeno's toytus' a bit too much from the well-read Mr. Gillian lol.<br /><br />As a fan of the band I am more than happy with this album, I feel this is the best output by them in a long time, I'll stick my neck out here, possibly their best since `Perfect Strangers'.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have read so much about Abraham Lincoln that I'm certainly not surprised that this film just covers his second term in office.  While it announces his death, Spielberg spares us the scene which has been shown many times before.  Who wants to see his death when you can see his life?<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is Abraham Lincoln incarnate.  Daniel Day-Lewis is to male acting what Meryl Streep is to female acting.  Both of them transport you into their roles as though you, yourself, are seeing out of their eyes.<br /><br />Spielberg has made an essential film which will always live in the lofty atmosphere of \\"Schindler's List.\\"<br /><br />Lincoln had messy hair and he hated when it was neat.  He challenged any tall man to stand back-to-back with him and his six foot, three and three quarter inch height usually made him the victor.  Lincoln was undoubtedly the strongest president we ever had.  He had more physical altercations than any professional fighter and came away with a better record than most.<br /><br />OK, there was too little time in this film to dwell on the stuff that made Lincoln a very funny and entertaining man.  To do Lincoln real justice, that other American jewel named Tony Kushner (Angels in America), would have had to have given us another six hour film that could only have been made for the small screen.<br /><br />If you want to know A. Lincoln as few others do. If you want a real treat, read Carl Sandburg's \\"Abraham Lincoln,\\" and don't you dare read the short version.  Read all six volumes.  It will be one of the top experiences of your life.  A Carl Sandburg sentence is a marvel to behold and the film LINCOLN by Kushner-Spielberg-Day-Lewis & Co. is a gift to the American people of the highest value.<br /><br />ARGO f-yourself took the Academy Award for Best Picture, but LINCOLN was the best picture of 2012 by a country mile.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not mention Sally Field for her thoughtful portrayal of Mary Todd-Lincoln.  I throw my hat in the air in celebration of James Spader's representation of W.N. Bilbo.  Hal Holbrook and John Hawkes added importantly to the film.<br /><br />Tommy-Lee Jones has played his best role to date as Thaddeus Stevens.  Kudos and plaudits to Mr. Jones who has the most expressive face in film today.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have been playing mostly hidden object adventure games but I absolutely love this game. It is just tough enough and really cleaved. I say buy it you won't be sorry especially if you like a challenge. The game worked great on my kindle fire hd.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|this game stinks because when you try to catch and you catch it and feed it it toys away with all your money. and when you beat levels you do not get any peanuts
B0085497ZW|5.0|As usual, Doris Kearns Goodwin knocks it out of the park.Excellent writing and extremely entertaining. Provides new insight to our greatest president ever.
B0043X1FL8|2.0|The mysteries of the human brain and how its plasticity make some conditions irreversible.<br />These are the six more words.
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|Its the most complete edition, better than European. Contains the shorts movies that the european disc has not, and has a beautiful lenticular cover.
0446547573|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my sister, she loved this book, she read it w/in 1 day. Makes a good gift for readers.
0440236304|5.0|An incredible story of one of many young people who went to face evil and and won. You can't just read this one, you will have to read Don's other three books too!.
0756404738|2.0|Booooring. There are few words that could better describe the sequel to a great first part in a trilogy. I was very disappointed in this book, the plot was so thin. Some parts were never-ending babbling, like many philosophical discussions that added nothing to the story, the dragging description of his encounter with Felurian and the Fae, and his time training with the Ademre.<br />Sure there is plenty happening too, but the action gets often interrupted by these long side-stories that don't seem to add to anything - will the author tie all this together at some point?<br />This book would be much better if it was 400 pages shorter - this is starting to look a lot like George Martin's never-ending 'Song of Ice and Fire'...
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I've been waiting for an App like this. This App makes reading the news a real joy. I had to reinstall after the initial install because it was a bit buggy but is fine now.
B005ISZRES|5.0|I am enjoying Little Women for the second time and probably getting much more out of it now that I am more mature. Worthy of a second read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omb my God this is the best game ive ever played most people think its bad. But I think its good
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is the kind of story you hope to come across when choosing a book. I just loved it!  I had never read this author before and wasn't expecting much of this book. Gee was I wrong!<br />The author can make you cry with sadness & then cry with laughter. It has been such a long time since a book made me laugh out loud as this one did.  A very touching story and I am so sad that it ended. I won't give details of the story since any perspective reader can get that from reading the description of the book. I am just letting you know that it is a book well worth reading. Very well written.  Read and enjoy.
B009X01D9U|5.0|It is very high quality & exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I got this in Orange (to be different).  I love it.  It doesn't smell like leather, but feels like it.  Spinning it is a little difficult, but that keeps it from slipping out of position.<br /><br />I wish the landscape positions would lay a little flatter, but that's because I use it while expressing breastmilk which requires me to lean forward.  For regular use - lying in bed, at a desk, etc, the positions are fine so not removing any stars for that.<br /><br />I had another cover that let you put the kindle in portrait using velcro, but this was super noisy and a little tricky to get in the right position that wouldn't slip.  I definitely prefer this.<br /><br />It was not difficult to snap into the case and it's not going anywhere.
B000002INR|5.0|This is a great CD! You can never go wrong with Skid Row! I actually met Scotti and we had a conversation about the cover of this record and how it came to be.
0738735027|5.0|If you like cats and you like tarot, then you will enjoy these cards.  I bought them more so just to collect then for reading. They are Rider Waite style, so if you are familiar with those cards it would be easy for you to use these for readings if you wanted.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Great... only issue is when you stump him, there is no &quot;enter&quot; button when you put in the name of the character on (my) kindle fire.. not sure about anyone else's though. but its still totally worth the two bucks (and 5starz).
B005ZWPR06|5.0|I still enjoy hearing the beach boys sing. well done CD as was their records many years ago. a must have for summer parties
B00004SZWB|5.0|Of course the CD is great (every song).  I purchased this to have a digital copy of my wax album.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|I have been having LOTS of trouble getting my Kindle to charge correctly. Sometimes it will charge, other times it will just be on the charger and the kindle will have a ? in the batter box on the screen. Sometimes, also, it will not even turn on but is charged.<br /><br />Is it my Kindle Fire or the charger??? Hmmm.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|it was a gift for my husband for his birthday and he loves it!!!  He watches the show every night.
0470913029|1.0|I ordered this to learn about a new diet, what I found was advice I could not afford to follow. Don't recommend this one.
B0052OZJQO|5.0|This represents the best in dance film.  The movement, the editing, the extraordinary choreography.  I love this film!<br />Hope it inspires more films like it.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|\\"Flight\\" is the story of pilot William \\"Whip\\" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) and his life of excess which becomes exposed following an act of great flying skill and bravery.<br /><br />At first he is a hero but then he is identified as a drunk becoming the subject of media and legal scrutiny.<br /><br />In hospital and recovering from injuries he is in the company of people far less fortunate than himself and he becomes more aware of his need for urgent self-change. It is also these very people who help guide him to a better self.<br /><br />Whilst Whitaker could sidestep responsibility it is the realization he needs to accept accountability with an honest conscious which is perhaps the most significant breakthrough of the film.<br /><br />As a movie narrative it is a rare case of right becoming a badge of self-worth but also a punishment for poor decisions.<br /><br />The cast consists of a unique group of personalities from all walks of life and as a unit their performance is quite absorbing.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THIS GAME, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. I THINK I PLAYED IT FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing and fun like temple run by better and if u did u can come back to life and there's more people to pay then on temple run an  temple run 2 scince I'm a parent I would recommend this game for kids then temple run and temple run 2.
B00BDRJ3Z2|3.0|This CD is fun and all, but I don't get why a 36 year old man is singing about spring break.  It's a little hard to relate to.  I could really love the song \\"Love in a College Town\\" if it didn't seem like he's singing about being in college still.  I don't know, I want to love it, but I like his previous stuff a lot better.  I wish he'd sing more from the point of view of a 30'something married man.  JMO
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They should make the game worldwide I got the app and it was awesome  till I found out that if you want more coins you have pay
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I bought this book after watching the TV show with Michael Mosley. I found the information and the way it was presented compelling and impressive. The book follows the TV show but with more detail and allowing time to properly digest the medical/scientific information. The real benefit is the diet information and menus which allow you to start the program yourself if you wish. I am starting this week. I am really quite excited by it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very informing and thought provoking. The author did an excellent job inspiring the inventor that lives within us all. Also there are a plethora of historical quotes from famous geniuses.
0316017930|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read. Brings together things that I knew but didn't realize I knew.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|ROBERT DOWNEY IS GREAT & HAS REALLY MADE A COMEBACK.  HOPEFULLY #3 WILL BE JUST AS GOOD.ENJOY THIS MOVIE, REALLY
B008645YH6|4.0|I didn't like her past style of music but now that she has this new &#34;electronic&#34; genre to her music I like her a lot more. Worth the buy in my opinion. I also have to say, some songs you have to listen over and over and over to like them. Luckily I had the patience  to do so and I love even more of her songs. You will love her if you love artists like Lana Dr Rey or lady gaga.
B00B5AIB14|2.0|The deluxe editions circa early 2000 were fantastic.  Unreleased tracks, alternate versions, and high quality live material.  Kaya Deluxe is the weakest of the bunch.  There is nothing new here.  Smile Jamaica was on the original remaster.  The Rotterdam 78' concert, while good, has been circulating for years.  A quick youtube search would get you the complete show (they removed Crisis from this release!?).  Another gripe is sub par the sound quality.  Far from professionally remastered.<br />There are outstanding dubs and demos from the album that should have made the cut.  This is a disappointment for the hardcore fan.  Don't be lazy Island.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|really enjoyed this. its been a long time since i read tom sawyer. the description of the cave was claustrophic... i thaught i was in the cave with them. loved it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It will take you a few levels of playing this game to finally get hooked on it. Very easy to learn and play.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's reef is a fun game.  Nemo's reef is better than an icecream sandwich on a summer day under the Texas Sun.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|Well made DVD.<br />Amazing how in sync everyone was. And having a good time doing it.<br />I've always been a Yes fan, I recommend it, I enjoyed it...
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Its nice to see Sci Fi shows taken seriously, you go to the SyFy Channel and it feels like nothing more than a joke
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I'm a new watcher and I LOVE THIS SHOW.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Great chemistry on all actors' parts.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book and am so glad I read it before seeing the movie. Now, I am even more excited to see the movie.
B001RIY4WE|2.0|for this to be Blu Ray .... the audio really blows .... not happy with it .<br />but as i was told ..... what can you expect for the price .<br />I should have bought the T2 Ultimate Edition ..... which has great audio ..... i owned it before and was very happy but lost it during a move .<br />I am going to buy the T2 Ultimate Edition edition and throw this one as far as i can throw it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I knew some about Tesla but had been intrigued to learn more about this amazing man once I stayed at The New Yorker last year. This book was a well written brief biography of Tesla as well as a reminder that things aren't always what the history books in schools teach you. A quick read full of interesting details of the battles between JP Morgan, Edison, Westinghouse & Tesla.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|kid time. we like to sit together and grow and collect things. great colors and fish friends that my toddler loves
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I loved this book.  As a business owner, I have to meet with investors, clients, bankers, the city council, and just about everyone else one can imagine.  This book will teach you how to win every time.
1250012570|5.0|Just got my copy today. so excited. can't wait. epppp.! I've heard so many great things about this novel, but the john green review sealed the deal. hope it lives up to my expectations.
0684857219|5.0|I am a newb to this realm although i've been a gym goer and extremely active my whole life. This book is wholly set up to provide more than adequate information to succeed in the sport and beyond. Well put together, an easy read, and effortlessly referenced
B00A83075M|4.0|It features a Rhianna song with lyrics &#34;Shut up and drive&#34; and has a little name calling. I loved the movie for myself, but if you are really picky about what you'll let your kids watch, especially of they are really young and impressionable, this might not be the best choice for you. If you are buying it for an adult or anyone over the age of 12 this is great! Cute story. :)
B0026QC0YU|5.0|Niice to be able to watch newer Movies on Amazon, Cruze is an alright actor for this part, I'd liketo see more of the mission team.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is such a cute show!! I loved all of the characters. It was a nice escape to watch these during the winter. I finished the entire season in less than a week. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I would suggest this to anyone in need of a little lighthearted comedy of adult nature in their lives.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It lets you know when your device is about to die before you are in dire straits.It also tells you the amount of time you have  left on different apps.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|THE HUNGER GAMES DVD WAS SO BAD I HAD TO RETURN IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THE DVD SKIPS AROUND AND YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT AT ALL.<br />DON'T BUY.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Very touching and uplifting  movie about a family dealing with the death of a child. Loved it1 It's an old movie, but I would recommend it to anyone.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. SUPER EIGHT WAS PERFECT. NO ISSUES WITH THE DVD. I LOVE IT. CONSIDER OWNING IT.
1581804849|5.0|This book helps you so much to see exactly how to approach painting flowers!  I give it two thumbs up!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Talking Tom Cat Free changed my life in ways i could never imagine!  I really enjoy this app, it's fun and easy to use. Thank you!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This novel was interesting to read both for the murder mystery and the glimpse into life in Soviet Russia, on both sides of political power.
B0093X805W|5.0|We love the story and the movies it inspired.  The chapters are just the right size for reading to my 5 year old before bed each night.
B00005ABKC|5.0|&#34;Woman in Love&#34; is absolutely my favorite Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers song and &#34;The Waiting&#34; is in my top five favorites by this band.  The rest of the album is also pretty good.  Southern rock - not too hard; not too soft; easy to listen to at any volume; made for listening to while having a bonfire and drinking beer.  Damn the Torpedoes is another really good Tom Petty album.
B005LAII08|5.0|The animation is FANTASTIC! Pixar at their BEST! Don't miss this one! In particular, that HAIR! How did they do it?
B00BOL126U|5.0|Aussie, Travis Fimmel (former Calvin Klein underwear model), nails the part of Ragnar Lothbrok, a restless, intense, sexy, viking, with tremendous ambition. Superb costumes, brilliant set design and a wealth of talented actors, make this series, a lush, visceral treat. Interaction between cultures, fierce fighting, sexy love scenes, and tender family moments, show vikings from a more human point of view.<br />I can't wait until next season!
B00005JKNF|4.0|The sound in the movie was very difficult to adjust, Otherwise the movie was fine. I love the period it was filmed in.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so glad to have it!  It works well most of the time.  Every now and again it has some glitches.  but for the most part I love it
B004N66XYE|3.0|I have the original Upstairs Downstairs DVD and it is much better than this one. I will watch it again and<br />perhaps I will feel differently than I do now. Again I love the period.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I LOVED Michaels other CD's and have been a fan since 2004.  This one just doesn't measure up.  Sorry, Michael
B005OKTPKW|5.0|This collection is great. Pink Floyd is one of those bands that, when I hear on the radio, I think 'why do I not have everything they have done?' This box set takes care of most of that!
B008XG1X18|5.0|My sister told me about this app and I believe I have used it every day since.  Good for arts and crafts---party ideas--cleaning---food--almost anything!!  Think twice because you will definitely end up pinning your life away :)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is the first ebook I have published - a children's book.  The step by step instructions were clear and allowed me to get my book published.  I encountered a few problems with uploading my images, but after several attempts and re-readings of the instructions, I ironed them out and it's done! Onward now to book number 2.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to keep track of every list I make and every thing I write. I have this app on every device I own.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|to be honest i didn't like this album. why? because they just through so much at you so fast you don't get a chance to hear what is going on...but after the 3rd or 4th listen youll find that this band is a monster. i like some of the fastest bands on earth, who have some of the fastest drummers on earth like hellhammer, frost, pete Sandoval, alsvid, and this band may be the fastest. i can say that their bassist is a fricking motherfricker, ive seen alex Webster live but this guy is just insane. the music is almost devourment mixed with nile and played at warp speed, when certain songs have breakdons its just awesome, chugging along with a evil atmosphere until the hammer falls and you get audibly beaten to death. few bands can do what these guys do, and this time theyre doing it coherently, and it kicks ass
B0080R7O7W|5.0|Love this album! I saved this for a long time before opening it. It is great! It is MJ what else can I say?
B000000H3W|5.0|this album came out somewhat early in sepulturas existence, they found theyre own south American style of thrash and in my opinion it is their best album. it also contains my favorite sepultura songs. this album is a must for thrash metal, and death metal fans, and extreme metal lovers everywhere, its got speed, great atmosphere and chugging, headbanging, sing along songs that will get stuck in your head!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|They did a awesome job picking who played what I cant see anyone else playing there characters! I bet they had a blast on set. I will watch it again with my friend we are in are 40's. Thank you for a good movie
B000305912|2.0|here we go. i hate emperor. i hate people that say emperor is the best black metal band ever!! and that in the nightside eclipse is the best black metal album ever....its not. in fact its no good at all.i have albums, from far better band that have albums that have only 2 good songs, but those songs are so awesome it makes up for the lack of good content. emperor are a overly, and unjustly worshipped band. this album sounds like it has a jar of smuckers hot fudge on top. barely audible anything, 2 good tracks aren't good enough to remember. go buy limbonic art moon in the scorpio for something that's good. the album art and band pivs on in the nightside are cool, but a polished turd is still just a turd,
