B006JSXYPA|1.0|The story is so boring. I still have not finished yet after three nights watching: I only take it for half hour.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child continues to grab the reader with his fast moving style and trademark twists and turns. This edition will leave you wanting more. If you haven't read all the Reacher novels , what are you waiting for?
B008RC72G8|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  I am a big Dark Shadows and Jonny Depp fan and although his performance was good.  The movie was silly and boring.  The movie was very campy but it just didn't come through.  It was not funny where it was supposed to be.  Boring, Boring Boring.
0385513755|5.0|I love the book and the picture. All it take you into the history reality. Very nice. I also recomment it as gift for someone you like.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys Music is never a disappointment. Their talent for arranging and preforming beautiful music is awe inspiring. I can't wait for more CD's from them!
1400049628|5.0|I bought this for my brother and his wife as a gift for their wedding day. they both love zombies and this book really mad a splash and they loved it. I only flipped through the book a little and honestly I found it kind of boring but don't listen to me I only read 2 random pages in the middle. I'm giving it 5 stars because my brother and his wife liked it so much.
B009329Y30|1.0|I tried to rent this movie through Amazon.com, but got a message from Amazon that said I could not watch the movie on my mobile device. I was very surprised to read an email receipt the next day, showing a charge for a movie that Amazon would not let me watch. Next, I contacted Amazon customer service, but I was not refunded the charge. Buyer beware!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was a page-turner.  It got off to a bit of a slow start, but once the plot thickened, it was hard to put down.  That is until the terribly disappointing ending that left me scratching my head and thinking, \\"that's it?\\"
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Pretty entertaining show, we kept wondering what would happen next or how the plot would develop.  Claire Danes seems to have been well cast, not sure I can say the same for Damian Lewis.  Good show so far, can see why it was popular with the awards.  The video quality was pretty good using Amazon On demand, though we would have loved having subtitles at points while watching with our roku box.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This toy is awesome. I'm 21 and when I saw this thing, I had to have it. It looks cooler than a rubiks cube and Ive been playing with it.... its challenging. So glad I bought this thing. It gives me something to do when I am bored. Two Thumbs up.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Amazon had the best price on this APU at the time I was in the market for it.  I used it to help build a gaming computer for my son.  The included GPU that comes as part of the APU is an AMD Radeon 7660D and is actually pretty darn good for gaming graphics.  It can be paired up / Crossfired with an AMD Radeon 6670 discreet card for increased performance and speed.  Even without being Crossfired, it runs games like Battlefield 3, Batman Arkham Asylum, Star Trek Online, Grand Theft Auto IV, PayDay: The Heist and more with full or close to full graphics turned on at 1280x1024.  My own PC at the time I wrote this review was an Intel Core i7 3770K with an AMD Radeon 7870 GHz Edition/OC Edition (overclock edition) from MSI, with 2 GB DDR5 dedicated video memory and PCI Express 3.0.  Although my hardware is technically faster and more superior, there was not much of a noticeable difference when playing the games I listed above or several other games - any that we tried - between the two computers.  There was some and my system definitely had the edge, but his AMD powered by the A10-5800K APU held its own and kept up pretty darn well.  I was surprised and impressed by how good of a job it did.  It cost about $500 less than my Intel-based system with a discreet graphics card and performed almost as well in games.  Bear in mind you can always upgrade to a faster, more capable discreet/dedicated graphics card later if you need to.  For general gaming this APU is more than adequate and is powerful.  It supports DirectX 11, as well.
B0063M22QO|2.0|Would be a much better game if it was more like the Window's Mahjong.  No choices of layout for the game, like the Turtle, Cat, etc.  Once you reach a certain level you have to go back and start different challenges, will not allow you to continue on the same level and format.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I have had this app for about three months and I absolutely LOVE it!!! It does freeze up every once and a while but that doesn't bother me. I hope you have fun playing this app!!!:)
B00902MCVY|5.0|Like a lot of people posting here, I was a huge fan of Wintersun, with their eponymous 2004 debut being a very part of my active \\"repeat listening\\" queue. The wait was TOO LONG for a followup... but I'm glad to say here that it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />It may not be as \\"OMG SYMPHONIC GUITAR SHREDDING\\" as before, but it is awesome in a different way - dense production values, complex melodies, prog but with catchy rhythms and melodies. Jari has such phenomenal vocal & guitar talent, and it's just ludicrous it is paired with such profound composition skills.<br /><br />My one complaint is that Time II cannot come soon enough, to complete what this album was meant to be.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put this book down. Very interesting look into the lives of the brave men willing to put their lives on the line to keep us safe.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra Streisand has been recording music for decades, with results that have usually been very good, and frequently glorious. The thrill of this CD for those of us who have been fans from way back is that we get to hear that remarkable voice as it used to be, not by listening to classic albums that we have heard over and over, but by hearing new songs, or at least new versions of songs. \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" from 1967 presents quite a contrast with the only other version of the song I had heard before, by Chad & Jeremy in 1964. Theirs was folky and Beatlesque, but young Barbra slows it down and makes the most of every note and syllable. We hear that young 60's voice again in a bossa nova number, \\"Lost In Wonderland\\", a very playful and entertaining song. Then, in just a few years, the voice had matured a bit, with Barbra sounding more serious as she sings \\"Didn't We\\" for an album that was never released, and \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" as a rehearsal for the \\"Stoney End\\" album. Both are beautiful renditions of these well-known standards. There is another song from the early 70's, \\"Mother And Child\\", not one of my favorites. Barbra sings a duet with herself, and does it well, but I just don't care for the song very much. In the mid-70's, Barbra achieved mass appeal, and this period is represented by a studio version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" from \\"A Star Is Born\\", which I like very much, and \\"Try To Win A Friend\\", surprisingly good even with country overtones, not Barbra's usual fare. \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" was omitted from 1985's \\"Broadway Album\\", and you can tell it is from that period because it sounds like it would have fit right in. The same can be said for \\"How Are Things In Glocca Morra\\", a very heartwarming performance recorded in 1988 for another Broadway-themed album, which was not released. \\"If It's Meant To Be\\" was intended for 2011's \\"What Matters Most\\". It reveals the inevitable change that Barbra's voice had sustained by that time, but her interpretive artistry is still very impressive. And \\"Home\\", recorded in 1985 but with the instrumental portion updated in 2012, is another triumphant anthem from the singer who has always belted them out so memorably. This album is a snapshot of an amazing recording career, and it shows many of the changes in voice, style and persona that have made Barbra Streisand such a fascinating figure for practically 50 years.but her interpretive artistry is still very impressive.

B000UX6THK|5.0|If I bought the Gold Box Edition for full price, I may have only given four stars for this comprehensive version of Twin Peaks but for the half off deal of the week this five star review is a no-brainer. It's not HD quality but for anyone who either loves this series but hasn't seen the international version of the pilot (a fully standalone movie more or less) or who hasn't been able to watch the show in full Dolby Digital sound before, this is what you want! Lots of extras, with two fairly beefy featurettes will give you some of the background on the series that you may not have read about since the show's original airing.<br /><br />Highlights of what you can look forward to in this box set: damn good coffee, spectacular cherry pie, and hands down the best broadcast tv in decades.
1451613512|5.0|\\"History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors and issues.\\" T.S. Eliot<br /><br />Those of you who have read Howard Zinn's [[ASIN:0060528370 A People's History of the United States: 1492-Present (Perennial Classics)]] or [[ASIN:1595583262 Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, Revised and Updated Edition]] will devour Oliver Stone and Peter Kuznick's The Untold History of the United States. These two intellects bring fresh insight to a benighted past. Minor footnotes and characters, like Henry Wallace, in our history's drama are bought to the forefront for once. The reader becomes Dante to Oliver Stone and Professor Kusnick's Virgil, taking us through the gates of Hell in our personal history. In these pages the real Truman, Eisenhower, Reagan are exposed, not extolled or lionized. It is inscrutable and unconscionable what Truman did in Hiroshima. The truth behind who really defeated Germany.  Terror bombing in WWII to terrorism in present day. As Historian Henry Steele Commager once pointed out, \\"From the beginning of our history, we've been rather casual about our crimes.\\"<br /><br /> Although the book is a companion to the documentary series on Showtime, which is highly recommended, the book stands alone and independent; it covers, in 14 chapters, the most important moments where we got history wrong. Cognitive dissonance will kick in. A certain sciolism exists in our culture as we whistle in the dark.<br /><br />This book reads like a modern day version of Thucydides, the Greek historian, [[ASIN:1466430397 The History of the Peloponnesian War]] and the corruption of language.<br /><br />As a culture inculcated by an embellished history, remember this:<br /><br />If we do not choose our leaders carefully and become more engaged, and stop viewing history in hindsight, then we risk our nation becoming either a kakistocracy or catastrophe - you decide. You have more power then you think.<br />Think independently. \\"Question everything\\" as Marx once said.<br /><br />Read this book.<br /><br />Tell it right for once.<br /><br />Warning: This book will keep you up all night... save it for a weekend read.tion everything\\" as Marx once said.<br /><br />Read this book.<br /><br />Tell it right for once.<br /><br />Warning: This book will keep you up all night... save it for a weekend read.

B008KE3960|3.0|The game is a good start for an app. But it lacks the ability/perk trees for each plane. It lacks a build your own function. It lacks upgrades. These are things that are now traditional for 'tower defense' games.<br /><br />Next is confusion that exists in the enemies. They need to be different vehicles and different abilities need to be obvious.<br /><br />I enjoy the game, but it misses out on normal traditional tower defense games.<br /><br />11/9: Maps need extra affects. If you get the Magic map, it should have tanks/map with powers...<br /><br />11/13: My luck that I bought the Map Package and they change the cost so its by gears. Come on.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|From what I've heard, this is, In This Moment's break-out cd. I have not heard their other cd's yet. This cd is absolutely incredible! Musical genius! Love her voice, love the band! The song \\"Blood\\" is blowing up where I live! The rock station in my area constantly comments on how it is the most requested song! If you love Rock/Metal I highly recommend checking out this CD. Worth every penny. Hope to see them live!

B0040HO16S|3.0|The first season of this series is delightful.  It's nice to see Julia Swahala in a role so different to Saffy in \\"Ab Fab\\", and Dawn French is fabulous, as always.  But things start to drag midway thru the second season, and by the third the plots seem contrived, and the characters stagnant (bordering on annoying).  Found the Prime streaming quite good.

B007V508CC|2.0|Although the picture in the description shows a cover of the \\"clean\\" version of Maroon 5 Overexposed, I received the \\"explicit\\" version of this CD. Customer service promptly sent a replacement, which again was the \\"explicit\\" version. If you are looking for the \\"clean\\" version do not order this item. 2 stars was for receiving the wrong order twice. Customer service was very prompt and apologetic and is issuing a refund, so 5 stars for customer service. As for the CD, I did not open either so I can not rate the songs.

B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I bought this for my laptop as a travel controller because my bag eats them alive after about 3 months. I liked how small it was and that it had a protective case. Amazon mailed it to me in about two days and I charged it over night. I paired it with my computer but could not get any response in controller or mouse mode. Just to make sure it was working I paired it with my Android tablet and it worked fine. After three days of calling I was finally able to get someone on the phone who first told me it was only made for android phones & tablets. I proceeded to tell her that it says plain as day (on the website) that it will work with PC's or Mac's in controller mode (for games that support direct input) or mouse mode. After that she put me on hold. When she came back I asked her just to walk me through getting it paired and working for mouse mode because I knew if I got that working I would be able to find a fix for controller mode. She could not get it to work in mouse mode and at the end of the conversation said it was really made for Android phone's and tablets and they might have the computer part worked out in a few weeks. The fact that I called and the support person didn't know it could be used on computer (when it says it on the website) was pretty bad. I will say it did work as stated on Android products but if you are looking for a travel partner for your laptop you are \\"SOL\\".<br /><br />From Nyko Play Pad FAQ<br /><br />Will the PlayPad work on PC or Mac?<br /><br />\\"Yes. The PlayPad is recognized as either a GamePad or a Mouse in either GamePad or Mouse mode. To use the PlayPad in GamePad mode, the software must support gamepad input. Please check your software manual for details on gamepad support. In Mouse mode, the PlayPad will allow you to move the cursor, and right and left mouse click.\\"<br /><br />*Update*<br /><br />They changed the wording on the website to cover their butts when it comes to if the controller will work with a PC. Doesn't really help all the people who have the controller already. Pretty shady company if you ask me.<br /><br />This is what has been added...<br />\\"Please note that the PlayPad has been designed and tested for use on Android devices, and compatibility with PC or Mac is not supported nor guaranteed by Nyko Technologies.\\"<br /><br />Here is a screenshot of how it was worded before because I knew this is what would happen.<br />oi45.tinypic/com/e7nwbs.jpg  (just make it .com)

B009LZDGSI|4.0|Although Sherlock Holmes has been a staple of my entertainment life I was not disappointed but I wasn't enthralled either. I have no doubt that I will enjoy further efforts, but there is the nagging hangnail that I might opt-out for the other show if the rememberability of this opus is not ascended. I want to watch!! The characters have enough meat on them to suffice but everybody like myself wants an ample and hearty meal of entertainment intrigue. &#34;Elementary&#34; could very well become a league favorite, but behind the scene arteries need to be dilated a bit more to secure a baited plateau in the minds of consumers.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|Let me start by saying that I love alternative history movies, and I love vampire movies.  This movie does not disappoint on either count.  The movie does a decent job of transforming historical events into an alternate history where slavery is an opportunity for vampires to have a steady supply of a food source (slaves).  The movie also credits the early victories by CSA armies to the fact that they had vampires fighting on their side.<br /><br />The movie successfully turns a historical hero [Lincoln], and transforms him into a superhero vampire killer.<br /><br />The movie also has exceptional production value, and has a particularly great action sequence where Lincoln jumps from horse to horse as the horses stampede away.<br /><br />It is a good movie, and it is a fun movie (if you allow yourself to like it).  I would have given it more than 4 stars if they had taken more care to do character development.  The character development that they did accomplish seemed hurried and somewhat cliche.  Foe example, Abraham was motivated to both abolish slavery because of a close relationship with a slave boy, but they didn't do much to develop the relationship.  You are simply told that they are close, but they never demonstrate it.  Similarly, Lincoln is driven to kill vampires because one killed his mother, but the director does not spend enough time on the pain of the event and how that transforms him to this driven man.  Part of this may relate to the fact that the lead actor does not do a great job of bringing the emotional side of Lincoln to the forefront of the movie.

B005HP2JAM|3.0|It's ok! The pictures in th cave does not look like real.<br />(I really need to type more than 18 words?)
6305090564|5.0|Throw in a bunch of over-acted robbers with some semi-hostages on a ship with an infestation of crazy sea worms (I forgot what they were called so I am calling them sea worms), and you get Deep Rising, which is, dare I say it.... my 2nd favorite Big Budget B-Movie-Like Creature Feature next to Piranha 3D which is in 1st place and The Blob `88 which takes 3rd place!<br /><br />Plot: It's simple yet cool! A group of robbers attempt to hijack a stationed cruise ship, sounds easy enough right, I beg to differ since all the inhabitance of this yacht is gone, well besides six, *bang, bang, bang* I mean three characters (The greedy owner of the ship, the captain, and a lovely woman with a mean streak), Now that the characters are all in place, unleash the sea worms and let the carnage begin, and when it begins, I'm not going to lie.... it's pretty grisly!<br /><br />Review: You would think this movie would capsize over it's weighted down characters and plot but nope, because these characters are basically characters from every epic yet over acted action movie *cough* deadly prey *cough* and it seems their soul purpose isn't robbing the place, loving guns, or even fighting the sea worms, it's more so that they are there to die by the worms and have a few good characters survive! I really didn't have a problem with the special effects, they were much better than Anaconda 1-4s, Deep Blue Seas, and Lake Placid 1-4s! They also didn't just take any ordinary Animal; it was Like Tremors on steroids in the ocean, Tremors had great animatronics with no CGI, you can't say that about Deep Rising for only one soul purpose, there was no animatronics, just pretty epic CGI. The film overall is very entertaining and the two problems I had with it was that I wish we could've seen the massacre but that leads to my other problem, it was a pretty long movie, but it was awesome non the less. The Director (Stephan Sommers) really shows how he wants the humor to balance with the horrors that definitely shows just as much in The Mummy 1 & 2 and Van Helsing! This Movie was awesome and even though it was long I still wanted more at the end, I really wanted a sequel with the same surviving cast and the same director, but no such luck has happened!<br /><br />Acting: It's like Aliens meets Deadly Prey meets Tremors. It had witty one liners, a great try-to-calm-down story to make some extra time go by, and funny, seriously funny, and dead funny characters who you take seriously at first but then laugh with at the end! I especially liked the part when the main robber guy disallowed Treat Williams the gun but then he saw what was coming and he practically kicked it up into his arms. It was a fun time with lots of likable characters!<br /><br />Gore: lots of grisly dead bodies, a mangled living corpse, a broken leg, some people get the blood sucked right out of them, hell, there is even an infamous scene where a woman is sucked right down the toilet and blood sprays everywhere... This film is definitely disgusting in quite a few scenes!<br /><br />Bottom Line: One of the best late 90's creature features, it is a shame I never grew up watching it, instead it was Deep Blue Sea, Lake Placid, and Anaconda that I grew up watching for late 90's movies! This film is a gem and it even has a somewhat 80's vibe to it.... all in all this film is spectacular fun!<br /><br />Rated R for sci-fi violence and gore<br />(Which is weird because there if a fair amount of f-bombs and other profanities in it and there is no \\"language\\" in the rating!?!)<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 4 (the movie itself is worth a four but the DVD isn't worth much (special features wise)<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5

B0000033WC|5.0|i've been a velvets fan for more than twenty years. since my highschool days. i remember that all the bands that i loved (including r.e.m. and the smiths) had listed among their influences the velvet underground. i took it upon myself to learn more when i heard \\"sweet jane.\\" i love the velvets: hard/soft, dark/light. i know some fans prize the velvets for when john cale was a member, while others prefer the more \\"mainstream\\" sound that the band produced while doug yule was a member. but, the velvets never went mainstream, so why not enjoy the songs for what they are-great music. \\"loaded\\" was finished without lou reed; and, maureen tucker was out on maternity leave. the albums first three songs, \\"who loves the sun\\", \\"sweet jane\\" (in it's original, un-edited version), and \\"rock and roll\\" are perfect. you also get the demo of \\"ride into the sun\\" with doug yule on vocals. i really do believe yule is underrated as a velvets member. he had a great voice; and, was more than capable as a musician. \\"ride into the sun\\" is also my favorite velvets song (although my personal fave version is the instrumental version that can hears on \\"another view.\\" the song doesn't need any words-it's that beautiful. there's also a great demo version of \\"i'm sticking with you.\\" i adore maureen's child-like vocals and acoustic guitar. you can't be a velvets fan and not have this in your collection.
B004I506G6|5.0|Gave this as a BDAY gift but we all watched it together and really enjoyed it. Thanks for sending it so fast.
1603425381|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I spend way too much time perusing the patterns while finishing an afghan.  I do eventually settle on one, but then I have 17 more ideas for projects!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Saw this at the movies and have bought the DVD. As a fan of the first 2 movies I thought this was as good. Movie is well paced like the first and builds to a great climax. Michael Fassbander is excellent. Leaves the door open for sequels as well.<br />Could be considered a prequel to alien but stands well enough on its own. Overall I thought Ridley Scott did a great job with this.
1451662432|5.0|Total Recall was a fascinating honest story of the American Dream. Arnold's charisma comes through the pages as you read his accounts of the maze of challenges, mistakes, and overall determination that it took to bring his dreams to fruition!  I really felt like I was right there with Arnold, cringing at embarrassing moments, laughing at other instants, but always completely mesmerized by the hard work, dedication and resolve it took to keep his vision alive and moving forward.  It was a page turning for me! I read it from start to finish in one weekend!
B00006JIA4|5.0|If you are a Queen fan, this set is a must have!!!  Even though there are duplications of songs on the 3 cds, I cannot get enough of Freddie Mercury and Queen!!!
B002VECM6S|2.0|ugh....a movie about a rich white happy christian family that adopts a little homeless doggy. The big shaggy football player is a gentle giant who protects the family in various ways--he watches their \\"blind side.\\" Its a foot ball analogy. During a car accident, he reaches out his arm and protects the little brother from flying through the windshield and becoming a human cannon ball. He has these natural \\"protective instincts.\\" Like the way he protects the playeres on the football field, he also protects the adoptive family. Blah blah blah. And they all live happily ever after.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst line in the movie is when Sandra Bullock says, \\"No, I'm not changing his life, he's changing mine,\\" or something corny like that. I think we could make a list of corny scenes and lines.<br /><br />Who knows what the truth is about this story, or how Michael Ohr really got into the NFL. This story is so self congradulatory.<br /><br />There is one small part in the movie that I do like. The part where Michael Ohr reads the poem \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade.\\" It is about warriors who march on when they know they will probablly fail. About the courage to do something really hard, like go to a new school where you don't know anyone.  But the rest of this movie is just so syrup-y. I guess you could watch it when you need a serotonin surge.<br /><br />The whole story, ultimately, is told from Leanne Touhy's vantage point. Every one in her world has names, personalities, goals. Everyone from Michael Ohr's world is nameless, goal less, hopeless. Obviously, Leannne thinks this kidnapping is a form of salvation for \\"michael.\\" Reminds me of Madonna going to Malawi to try to adopt some kid she knows nothing about, from a world she has nothing but pity for.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a great collection of classic films.  The sound and video quality are excellent. I highly recommend this collection to any Indiana Jones fan.
B000026OW3|5.0|Just snatch this one before it becomes unavailable like some of the sets. I nearly did not buy it! I was suspicions about the price and thought that sound quality may be poor. Not so, it is a fantastic collection of Chopin's music and Rubinstein needs no recommendation. I consider this box set far superior to the one released by Brilliant Classics (The Complete Works), see my other review.
0307716511|3.0|I found Sister: A Novel to be an interesting read. I did not cry nor could I not put the novel down.  It was a very interesting story with several good twists. The novel definitely wasn't a waste of time, but something different to experience.I found the novel made me think more about my relationship with my own sister. There is something to be said for a novel which makes you think and question the things in your life you decide to share or not share with loved ones. I would recommend reading it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought \\"Spirited Away\\" for my daughter who said that has been one of her favorite movies ever for her 20th birthday and we all watched it together.  The movie came in clear and we all enjoyed it! This movie was hard for us to find so she was really surprised when she opened it and giggled like a small child when she saw it.  Very pleased with the purchase!!!!!  :)
145162445X|5.0|I have read Lawrence Krauss' books always with interest and intrigue.  A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING, however. is perhaps his best and his easiest to understand. From the Doppler effect to the ever present expansion of the universe, he disects complex hypothesis, equations, formulas  and whatever else so we can understand them. His phylosophy is, if we understand those concepts we more easily accept them.  Excellent book!! It has been said by many scientists, like Sean Carroll, Richard Dawkins, stephen Weinberg that Dr. Krauss is perhaps the Eistein of the XXI century. Read this book and you'll understan why.
B002LC8HF0|3.0|The first novel in the trilogy remains the best. But I was mostly satisfied with this, his end product. I do hope to eventually read his next Mist born novel when I have time.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it was fun at first. but later, game play requires in app purchases to complete. if you don't mind,  go for it. the search games are cool, especially the blackout search.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This is a very well written book.  That's about the only positive thing I can say about it.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander was in a coma.  He did NOT die although he was close to death.  His descriptions of \\"heaven,\\" besides being colored by his religious desires & needs seem TO ME to be nothing more than nightmares and dreaming.  Granted this is just my opinion but this whole review is nothing more than my opinion so please take it for what it is.<br /><br />There are so many more interesting books on \\"life after death\\" written by other physicians and people who actually have had NDE's.  I'm sorry I spent the money on this one but I was intrigued by what a neurosurgeon would have to say about this.  It turned out to be ... not so much.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was in high school 11/22/63.That date is in the top five of the days that affected my life most. A little of my \\"Pollyanna\\" attitude died that day with Kennedy. While reading the book some of the feelings came back but I also got a little more of the country's true political climate, (not so prevalent in the rural mid-west).  I loved the book, one of Mr King's best and I look forward to his next novel, though I doubt he can top 11/22/63!
B0081BU42O|5.0|A soft sequel to Excession and it marks the end of Iain M. Banks long slump since Look to Winward. Excellent in all respects.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read all the books by Nelson DeMille, but this one is definitely not one of his best.  I am halfway through and right now it is mostly background about Yemen and nothing more.  A far cry from The Lion's Game.  I am wondering if DeMille is losing his touch as his most recent offerings have been a disappointment.  One final comment, the constant wisecrack remarks from hero John Corey is way over the top and a distraction to the story.
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|OK, I didn't read this exact book of the series, but it was likely the worst children's book I have ever read. The poor grammar was a turnoff, but not as much as the just plain nastiness of the \\"humor\\" of the book.  Given all the marvelous children and adolescent literature available why anyone would waste their time on this series is beyond me.  We read it for a book club where we pick a children's book every year for December.  Now, I make other suggestions so we don't get stuck with books like this.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I think this should be required reading for young high schoolers. They should know how even the smallest action, or inaction, can have a real impact on others.
1612183956|4.0|Blake Crouch's latest book, Pines, features Secret Service Agent Ethan Burke, who has been sent to the picturesque town of Wayward Pines, ID, to investigate the disappearances of two other Secret Service agents, one of them a former paramour.  However, Ethan wakes up in a hospital after being in an automobile accident.  He can't remember much about his life and his wallet and phone are missing.  As Ethan tries to figure out what happened, he can't get anyone to believe that he's a Secret Service agent with a family waiting for him.  And the people of this town act very strangely...<br /><br />The book kept me hooked, as is the usual with anything from Blake Crouch and/or J.A. Konrath.  I was dying to know what was going on, what was happening to Ethan, and what had happened to his family.  How was it possible that no one was looking for him?  Why was it when he called his superiors no one had heard of them?  Why wasn't his wife getting his messages?<br /><br />I liked most of the book, though I felt the end was a little...too sci-fi.  But I don't think you'll be disappointed overall in this book.<br /><br />Highly recommend to fans of the genre.
B008S847X2|5.0|If you like jazz-fussion, this is your record. Mclaughlin come back better than ever. Full of energies and ideas. Sure is the best with 4th Dimention. Gary Husband is a perfect pianist for fusion. Etienne is great on bass and Ranjit Barot is powerful on drums. Even the ballads are strong. The melodies are great and the rimth is crazy.  \\"Now,Here, This\\" is Mclaughlin  better than ever. A miracle in his career , now after 50 years, he still and the top.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing! Their music is relaxing and refreshing and just plain enjoyable!! If you haven't checked out their music videos on YouTube then you're missing out!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well it is very entertaining and very very addictive I played it for hours on end... just a little slow every once in a while.... Over all I LOVE it&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!
B003H6KRIE|3.0|Disc 2 & 3 played very good.  My only problem was disc #1 \\"Bourne Identity\\" which kept freezing up and had to unplug/plug back in BluRay player in order to eject disc. It is my favorite of the 3, so asked Amazon if they could replace that one disc with one that hopefully works as well as all the other BluRay DVDs I've purchased from them.  Just a heads up to those interested in this excellent trilogy.
0525478817|5.0|This book touches on so many things that cancer patients, teenagers, and even some adults experience and struggle with in life. I particularly enjoyed the slower-paced scenes when the two of them were just together in those calm moments, when everything and nothing was happening.<br /><br />Beautiful book, highly recommended.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|I loved the Broadway show so I knew I'd probably like the movie.  It's really all about the music - there's not much story, but the music is great.
031620157X|5.0|I'm down to the final fifteen pages now, so I figured it's time to review this book. I've had moments while reading this book where I've laughed out loud, cried, or gotten frustrated, but no matter what happened, I never wanted to put it down! Chris Colfer is an amazing writer and I'm so proud to own a copy of this book!
0345529057|5.0|The order came in real quick.  The books were in great shape - I was surprised how good they looked (bran new).  Haven't read them all yet so have not looked inside, but pleased and excited to read them.
B005IQZB14|5.0|As having read more than 50% of this fabulous book, I look back to times I have hiked on trails with the mantra of putting one foot in front of the other, looking forward to cooking over a camp fire and zipping into a tent in the light of day, knowing it was to be an early morning to depart for other hiking/climbing adventures! Unlike Cheryl, though, I was in the company of my husband and some really great friends!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|But, regardless, this book clued me to try (for a few days) going gluten free - and the difference in 24 hours was amazing - last night, 3 weeks later, having remained gluten free, I absently picked up a small round of french bread at a party to use as a dipper, and this morning I'm back to all my \\"issues.\\"  Thank you, Doctor!  It has really brought home to me the GMO issues, also. Scientifically written, not filled with doomer hype.  Definitely worth the investment. I have numerous friends I could send a copy to for their issues (all of which were mentioned in the book - and not surprisingly - all are inflammatory).
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was just awesome, I couldn't even put it down.............Book 3 was the best to me.<br />I would most definitely read it again...
0739350323|4.0|The Alchemyst<br />The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel Book One<br />By Michael Scott<br /><br />Every legend and myth has a grain of truth, in this book we find out that the \\"Elders,\\" or what we call Ancient Gods, are real some are good and some are bad but each have a stake in two teenagers lives. Nicholas Flamel is the keeper of a very peculiar book but one day it is stolen and along with it his wife is kidnapped when Sophie and Josh Newman help Nicholas to escape it comes to everyone's attention that these two are not ordinary children, but are the twins that where prophesied in the book who will save the world.<br /><br />This book is a great beginning to a story with a lot of action and events that keep you entertained throughout the book. It has a great premise though this book wasn't spectacular it promises a series that should be. With witches and vampires along with Gods all warring to protect two people or to destroy but my favorite scene was towards the end when we catch a glimpse at the necromancer's powers, this is a truly interesting book. The author brought many details into this book which can be a bit of an over load but it was all written so richly and comprehensively that the story becomes enthralling and promising for later books.
B001OBT3FM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. Anne-Sophie Mutter's performance was superv, the piece chosen could not have been better.<br />The perfrmance of Tchaikovsky's No.6 was outstanding, the orchestra at its best and, of course, Mr. Ozawa lived the piece intensely from beginning to end. This DVD is super. Thanks.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I hate this game. Once you run out of coins you have to buy more with real money. Now I can never play this game again!!!!!
B003L0VJF6|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find Julia Fischer's superv mastering of both instruments, each with its unique complexity.  Interesting curiosity which I hope will have sequels. Thanks.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|The series was great! This movie is the first four episodes together, but it is easier to tell what the characters are thinking. I suppose there was some added character development scene that way someone new to the series could understand what kind of people they are dealing with. I was... 14 when I first saw the series and would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch characters grow, giant robots (evas) battle, or even just jam out to the music. The only problem with the series I had was the fanservice, but I got used to it after a while. This is a legendary anime brought to the big screen with beautiful animation. You are missing out if you haven't seen this or at least the series. WATCH IT!!!<br />SPOILERS: There was a butt and sideboob scene as well as a coming out of the shower scene where Shinji (the main character) accidentally lands on top of a naked Rei. Other than that I can't recall any other nudity.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The actual act of finding the hidden objects is fun. What I do not like is basically being forced to buy diamonds in order to progress at ANYWHERE near a reasonable rate. The hunting room and on it appears you need TEN of an item.  That would be fine, if the item dropped at more than what seems like 1 in 20 attempts. It would also be fine if you only needed the items for the first run through.<br /><br />If not for the very blatant in your face showing of Game Insight's greed, I would have rated the game a 5. Compared to this, ZYNGA gives away there items that csn be bought either with money or item you earn by playing. And Zynga is greedy and thar greed is what drove me away from their games on Facebook.<br /><br />I don't even mind how long it takes to restore energy. It means I generally don't have to continue playing the game in order to get rid of my energybsso that I get the most out of the time that I'm not playing. But I can imagine that 1 energy per 3 minutes woild bother some considering that it takes like 20 energy to even do 1 room.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a great game to pass time with. Be aware you will get cheated though!!!! For instance  when your &quot;special coin&quot; drops that is supposed  to give you 2 coins well it will only give you  2 coins even if more than one &quot;special coin&quot; dropped! Sometimes  you dont always get credit for the coins that dropped  either!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun its addictive! Its nice to see a free app with so many levels. The kids love to play it but I love it too!
B005OYKI1I|3.0|Amazon suggested I review this film because apparently at some point I watched it on Amazon.<br /><br />Well,  I suppose I must have,  since I have a receipt for it and all,  but I honestly don't remember a single thing about this movie.  Where there cars in it?  Maybe.  I don't know.  I probably watched it,  and may have been entertained.. and don't remember anything about it.  That's my review.
0446580848|5.0|The Panther is De Mille's best work since The Lion's Game. It's a great plot and keeps getting better the more you  read .His character ,John Corey,is brilliant .The audio version narrated again by Scott Brick is even better.Please Nelson....don't take so long to write the next John Corey book.
B0091THDOM|4.0|As most of the other reviews stated, this sleeve is VERY snug.  I guess that is both good and bad.  I shoved my iPhone 4 in the case to help &#34;stretch&#34; it out a little. I did this a few days and think it helped a little.
B0083VFEMW|5.0|Scissor Sisters are awesome and this latest release from them just continues to prove that.  My favorite tracks are \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" and \\"Shady Love\\", but the whole CD is great.  If you're a fan, then I would say this is a must have.

1592289444|5.0|This has to be by far the most moving, touching and emotive story that I have encountered this year, and which really touched my heart with its undeniably frank and candid message. This heroic tale is told in such a way as to astonish its readers, speaking to your inmost core, as it leaves a mark with those significant words echoing on forever. Rawicz carries his reader along the rocky path with each weakening step that is sustained by his simple undying vision, of the liberty that lies beyond the cruel emptiness that faces him. It is a heartfelt, meaningful true story of a trek to freedom that speaks of the desperation of the journey and the heroism that is acquired. Beyond the emptiness of Siberia and the sterile gravles of the Gobi there is beauty found in the void, where triumph will reign supreme over despair and which digs deep within the vastness of ones soul.<br />Salvomir Rawicz was a young polish cavalry officer who on the 19th November 1939 was arrested by the Russians, and afterwards was sentenced to a brutal twenty-five years in the Gulags. He was tortured and interrogated to the extreme, and this part of the story does not fail to overwhelm, rendering you speechless. After a three month trek to Siberia in the depths of winter he escaped with six companions, who realized that staying in the camp would almost definitely lead to certain death. Then in June 1941 they managed to cross the trans-Siberian railway and headed onwards South, climbing into Tibet and finally to freedom nine months later in March 1942. After traveling on foot through some of the harshest, severe regions of the world including the vast Gobi desert he was able to bask in his freedom that had come at last.<br />This book first published in 1956 has to be one of the greatest true stories of adventure, survival and escape ever told and which completely overwhelms me every time I re-read it. There are many stories of similar design that talk of journeys and perilous escapes but none leave you as affected, disturbed and moved by this personal account that is of such a magnitude. Rawicz recounts the hardships that the prisoners endured of the Russian system in the early years of world war two, and his time as an officer in the Polish cavalry. The latter part of this book (which covers his escape and journey), I find to be most noteworthy and which makes one really think about life in general as you never have done before; as life is indeed very imperative. Just when you think it is all over; the grief, the despair and the adversity, then comes more torment as they set out walking south to freedom which is finally concluded in India. This is such a spectacular read and one which I cannot enthuse about enough for it never fails to strike a chord within my heart, leaving me with so many emotions flowing around my body that can only be a portion of what the author actually felt himself. It is an extraordinary feat of courage and hope and which instills upon one a sense of courage and positivity, for your outlook on life is good when you survey yourself in it. I am sure that I can even begin to imagine what he went through, and so hold the author in high esteem as someone to look up to with much respect and admiration.e you as affected, disturbed and moved by this personal account that is of such a magnitude.

B008LSVLVA|5.0|Steven Wilson is probably the most creative musician around today. His output is consistently great, and at the same diverse enough to keep from getting old. And while it seems as if Porcupine Tree (his main band project) is on indefinite hold, Wilson continues on in a variety of directions. This concert DVD is basically a concert of Wilson's solo work (2 albums and another coming up in 2013). He's joined by some first class musician friends and the result is a concert experience of incredible quality. Personaly, I like Wilson's solo work, but I wasn't sure how it would translate to the live stage (especially the stuff from Grace For Drowning). In fact, the songs translate quite well. This show is Pink Floyd like at times with the dark but cerebral atmosphere, but then its more artsy. I wonder what it was like watching it live, particular with the sheer curtain between the band and crowd for the first third of the show! Marco Minnemann on the drums is world class and his performance is a true highlight! The rest of the band is very good as well. I hear that this is the band that Wilson is taking into the studio to record his 3rd solo album. It's supposed to be kinda jazzy. Overall, this is no doubt a five star performance. Interesting music presented in an interesting manner. I also noticed that Steven Wilson's stage presence is a bit different than when he's fronting Porcupine Tree. For example, what was with all the hand flutters and conducting manuevers!

B002PEP4SC|4.0|[[ASIN:0786891416 Heat Wave, Premium Edition (Nikki Heat, Book 1)]]<br />I was curious about reading Heat Wave because I am a fan of the TV show \\"Castle\\".  I found the book very entertaining and full of action with at taste of humor,much like the TV show.  Nikki Heat is much more aggressive in the book than on the show and isn't afraid to confront her adversaries with force when necessary. The book was well written with a plot that kept the reader interested. I think readers who enjoy the TV show will also enjoy this book.
1476712042|5.0|This was a great book that I couldn't put down. At first I wasn't sure that I would be into it given the story line but it had such great reviews I went for it and I was extremely glad I did. It was reality based with good twist and turns. I would recommend this book to any age reader.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I've tried a few other battery apps and like this one the best by far.  Does not drain resources like some of the others seem to do, which kind of defeats the purpose.  I highly recommend this app if you are looking for a sleek, well designed program that does not run down the very battery it has been designed to monitor.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have long been fascinated by the convergence of science and spirituality, ever since experiencing physical healing through prayer as a child. Growing up as a Christian Scientist, it was very normal to think of God as ever present Love and mankind as spiritual beings at the core.<br /><br />I very much appreciate the courage that Dr. Alexander has shown for sharing this experience with us. There are \\"miracles\\" going on around us every day, but the unique combination of elements in his story (the fact that he was a neurosurgeon who held a materialist view, and that he understood `the brain so well that he could readily see that his experience was impossible if an explanation was attempted though reductionist science) means that he could have a real impact on the future of study in this area.<br /><br />For those who come to this book with an open mind, I fail to see how it will not have a profound impact on how they view the most important questions related to meaning, purpose and existence.<br /><br />An enthusiastic five stars!

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I'm a huge Avengers fan (hell, I'm a gigantic comics fan!). The characters are perfect for the movie. I was skeptical when I saw a few of the lone character films (Incredible Hulk, ehh) and Black Widow in IM2 was somewhat glossed over. It's great to see that she gets a back story (at least hinted at) and Jeremy Renner kicks a** in everything he does (Watch 'The Town')Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk was friggin' incredible. He had just the right amount of humor and shaken nerves that shows that even he's afraid of losing control.<br /><br />The disc packaging is just as you'd expect. Average, but nothing special. I was going to wait until the complete Avengers set was available with each character's films in the Teseract case, but, alas, that was postponed. The film is crisp and clean. The sound was perfect. With the extras, you'll see that the film could have gone in a different direction. There is a Steve Rogers scene in the beginning that would have helped newbies understand him a bit more (explaining the character in the theatre got me a lot of shhh's and looks from audience members).<br /><br />BTW Tom Hiddleston as Loki should get an Academy Award nomination. He made Loki a villain with a purpose and added a few moments that almost made feel sorry for him.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I ran across this book by accident, while doing an Amazon search for a different book. It appeared under recommendations, so I decided that I'd buy it. It turned out to be one of the most important decisions of my like. Prior to reading this book, I never gave it so much as a thought that each person in a relationship, be it marriage or otherwise, has their own unique way of looking at the world. If your partner and you are not in tune with what is meaningful to each of you, it will be difficult to sustain a long-term, satisfying relationship. After reading this book, I have a totally new outlook on marriage and relationships in general. It's important to know the love language of your partner because it may be completely different than yours. Effective relationships require not only a mutual respect for one another, but a deeper understanding of what your partner finds important and what they find unimportant. After reading this book, I realized that many of the things that were important to me, weren't to my wife and vice versa. Now that we realize that each of us has their own love language, an already wonderful marriage has become even better. I believe that this book should be required reading for anyone in a serious relationship. It will have a profoundly positive effect on your life and the life of your partner.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|In a world where it's a hell of a lot easier being an extrovert; Susan Cain provides exceptional insight as to why the world would suffer a great loss if there were no introverts. I found this book to be profound, especially in light of the fact that so many of the greatest inventions and accomplishments were made by introverts, not extroverts. The author is not stating that it's better to be one or the other, but rather, she brings home the point that being an introvert can be a really good thing. Being an introvert myself; I tend to do a lot of analytical thinking. I'm uncomfortable at large social gatherings. In my case, as in the case of the author, my success in life came from listening and thinking, rather than talking. This is an outstanding book, the likes of which I've never run across before. When I read it; I felt as if it were personally written for me.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Second only to the concert ticket she received, my niece loves the dvd.  She has watched it multiple times and can not stop smiling.
B009KHCLIS|5.0|I love How I Met Your Motger! Brilliant writers, great cast.<br />This is the first time I've used Amazon Instant Video-- it was so easy and worked perfectly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and it works very good. It never freezes and it loads very quickly. This app is one of my favorites of all my apps! If you have a Kindle Fire, this is a must-have app.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This wasn't a bad book, it really wasn't.  I enjoyed the storyline, and the author is pretty good.  With that said, I do have to agree with many of the other reviewers.  First, the ending - or rather the reason for the story - is a little hard to swallow.  I don't want to say much more than that because I don't want to spoil the ending.  I'll just say that, for me, it went beyond unbelievable into the nonsensical.  The cause and effect that he established didn't really gel for me.<br /><br />Second, the author really, really likes to describe things.  He would often interrupt action to describe something for a couple of paragraphs when a sentence or two would have been much better.  I also found myself skipping when he would delve into flashbacks.  They seemed to go on and on for quite a while without a lot of obvious relevance to the story.<br /><br />I did enjoy the different points of view that the author employed.  They helped create a break in all the chasing that was going on.  I also generally liked the storyline.  It keeps you wondering what is wrong with the town.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy the book, although it did have its issues.  I certainly wouldn't say that I wasted my time reading it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There were so many twists and turns in the plot of \\"Gone Girl\\" that it was difficult to put the book down and get on with my day/evening.  Excellent read!  Greatg story line!  First time I've enjoyed a novel but didn't care for the main characters!
1469984202|5.0|It's rare for a book when its opening sticks to my memory for so long after I've read it. Just like William Gibson's Neuromancer and Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, this is the case of another masterpiece, Wool.<br /><br />I came to Wool back on July 10 by a post from the Western Suburban Sci-Fi Book Club [...] and I have to agree, if you haven't read Wool yet, I am jealous of you. If only I could erase my memory and read it again from scratch...<br /><br />As a work of art, it's fantastic. Intelligent. Intriguing. Astounding. Fascinating. Howey is a natural-born story teller. Through every page you can feel the cold of the surroundings; the fears, anxiety, hopes and inner conflicts of each character; the thrill and heat of each moment; the love and hate between characters. All this through pages you can't stop turning. You feel like you're immersed into the story, being part of it.<br /><br />As a work of literature, it's splendid. You can't tell it's self-published. The writing is just right, not so easy, neither so simple; just plain readable and enjoyable. The plot is entertaining, magnetic, mesmerizing. Each character is vivid in your mind in quite enough details of looks, actions, feelings and relationships taught by a mix of both explicit and implicit characterization.<br /><br />I tend to avoid reviews that tell about details of the story. I consider any tiny bit of it as being a spoiler. So this is about all you'll get from me. Go ahead, read the book and learn the story by yourself! =) It's a great book. I loved it from start to end.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|It's great .except for the fact that its a little.I mean like they made it a little bit really hard.
B0086700CM|5.0|First, I'd like to start off by saying that is NOT a \\"fake\\" review. I am NOT giving Temple Run a five star review because I was promised more coins if I did. I REALLY DO like this game and best of all it's free. To the people who have claimed that Temple Run is boring; I pity you. You just don't get it. Yes this game is simple, but only the controls are simple. The challenge in this game is how far can you get before you're tripped up and you die. Not every game app is supposed to be complex with numberous stages and challenges. Temple Run allows you to collect coins during the game that you can use to buy upgrades for the game such as power ups you can pick up as your 'running'. You can also use the coins to unlock other characters. I really can not understand how anyone can acturally complain about a game that cost them NOTHING to get. If you really don't like it, you can always uninstall it.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I am a big fan of the old Dark Shadows series and wasn't sure about this movie before I saw it. I have to say I did enjoy it though as I'm also a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan and they did a decent job. It was a bit too condensed and although they used a lot of the story line they did change things a bit and didn't explain a few key things such as why was Julia Hoffman living at Collinwood and why she was the drinker. That's just an example of the differences.  I wonder what someone who has never seen the series would think of the movie and curious to read a review by such a person. Overall though it was very entertaining and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars though it's more of a 3.5 for me. Fun.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is by far the best action / adventure movie to come out in that genre in many years. It has all the elements to make a movie experience great. It has unstoppable action; truly evil villians; solid heroes; mis-guided and then re-directed loyalties; and, an even greater evil to face in the future. What more could anyone ask for in a movie?

0062060562|5.0|This philosophical, profound novel is brimmed full of suspense and tension, that draws you into the narrative with every page so that you end up loosing yourself completely within SJ Watson's writing. This book makes for such a satisfying read, with such perceptive exploration of a fascinating neurological condition as to render one speechless. It is not only a brilliant thriller but also an astonishing and terrific first novel that is well-written, genuinely unsettling and psychologically very, very good and highly plausible. This exceptional spinechilling thriller left me with Goosebumps as the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end; it was like nothing I had ever encountered before. S J Watson's novel is credible and convincing, with such a gripping narrative that will make you stay up reading until the early hours as I guarantee you will find it hard to put this book down. It's like imagining that when you fall asleep every night that you know you will wake up in the morning with all your memories having been wiped away, which is `real' fate of the main character Christine Lucas. Her bewildering and quite bizarre internal world in rendered with chilling intimacy that makes this debut literary thriller such a fascinating and remarkable read.<br />The story is based around Christine who loses her memory when she goes to sleep one night as has to start a fresh every time that she wakes up. It is so intriguing to experience and see what it is like for her through her own eyes, as she figures out where she is whilst everything has to be explained to her by the man that is her husband. She then begins to keep a journal and writes down everything that happens to her each day, as recommended to her by her doctor that visits daily and reminds her to read the journal. With each passing day she continues to read what has happened in her life the day before that confuses and perplexes her, for she is unable to remember what happened even though she reads the words that were written. As the book progresses you soon start to realize that something is not quite right, and a sense of foreboding and apprehension ensues that makes you even more curious to read on and find out more. I was just glued to my seat desperate to uncover the truth of this indeed extraordinary and original tale, which was totally out of the ordinary to your more stereotypical thriller.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all fans of the genre as it is a novel that not only astonished me, but which reinstated my love for thrillers all over again. The lucid quality and nerve tingling style to SJ Watson's writing is truly exceptional, and I cannot enthuse enough about a brilliant debut book.ere written.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|On advice of a friend, I bought this with rather low expectations. The only character with which I was familiar was Iron Man. Downey shines. Having enjoyed the movie thoroughly, I now have to dig into the back stories. Haven't read the comics so I would like to seen some characters developed more. Now to find DVDs of them individually.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|at first I thought \\"oh no, its not gonna top the first book\\"  but was I wrong on that!<br />Now I wonder if they will make another movie based on this book?  I really enjoyed the Hunger Game Books!!
0765315246|3.0|This was a very good book. It only got three stars because of the never ending profanity all the way through the book. I mean, it was every couple of pages (every page ???) and the profanity added nothing. It wasn't even like his Momma failed to wash his mouth out with soap when he was growing up. It wasn't shock value. You could take a marker and black out the profanity and the book would improve, not be worse, except for all the little magic marker spots throughout the book. An occasional swear word, appropriately placed, can sometimes add something to the context, or even make you have a good long laugh because of the dialogue and the word fitting so well.<br /><br />A writer should write so the words add something to the book, not detract from it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another Great BOOK!  OOPS just realized i got the book 2 and 3 mixed up  in my reviews.  LOL!!  All I can say is READ ALL THREE BOOKS.!!!
0312641893|2.0|Cinder had great potential for me, but failed in some heavy ways.<br /><br />1)  Cinder. I thought I would like her from what I got in the first chapter, which was a great chapter in general, but I disliked her a lot as the book progressed. I think the \\"I am a second-class citizen/practically a slave/property\\" was executed badly. Cinder was not portrayed to carry well the characteristics that made the original Cinderella more likeable and, instead, made her come across as whiney, ungrateful, ignorant, and rude. I had far more sympathy for Adri (Cinder's stepmother) than I did for Cinder herself.<br /><br />2) The chapters. I feel each chapter should present a \\"purpose\\" and make the story progress but I didn't feel this at all. There are too many chapters that don't develop anything. There is a lot of chatting (and info-dumping via chatting), which made the chapters drag on that much more.<br /><br />3) Overall plot. In regards to Cinder, it's very predictable what she is, but I was more concerned with the lack of plot. I feel like I get a lot of info and not much plot. The plot pick up in the last 10 or so chapters of the book and I definitely felt all of those chapters should have happened way before. The ending of the book felt like the climax, not a proper ending, leaving me frustrated because things were finally progressing.<br /><br />3) POV change. It's very hard to execute multiple POV change in a book and this one did it badly. Kai and the doctor get their own POVs but they came FAR too late. I was already settled reading through Cinder's eyes and these additions were out of nowhere. I felt like they had no purpose, but maybe if they had come much earlier and helped progress the story/characterization more effectively, it could have been a greater read.<br /><br />I will say I really adored the doctor and found Kai's personality likeable. They were the best part of the book. However, I don't understand what Kai sees in Cinder. That wasn't illustrated well, which was a shame because I did like him a lot and wished he got a better Cinder.<br /><br />I also did like the idea of a dystopia where a new plague has struck and cyborgs exist. I would have liked to understand a bit more about cyborgs instead of getting so much info on the Lunar people, which weren't woven into the story that effectively I felt.<br /><br />Essentially, I felt like I was going to read a particular book and got something quite different. I got a book that kept dragging on and ultimately was disappointing.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another terrific story from this acclaimed author! Keeps you wondering whats going to happen until the last page. This is a great read for a rainy afternoon and I recommend it.
030759565X|5.0|I absolutely love the Smitten Kitchen website, and this cookbook does not disappoint! The photos are gorgeous, and the recipes are so creative. I love the way the recipes read because Deb includes tips, tricks, and background stories with each recipe. This is no ordinary cookbook. You can really hear Deb's voice in the book. When I'm reading a recipe and prepping to cook or bake, I feel like Deb is talking through the recipe with me. She breaks down difficult steps to make them easier and more manageable, and she understands that not everyone knows every cooking technique. This cookbook is incredibly well-written, and I can't wait to buy it for all of my friends and family who enjoy cooking.

B001NLCBJI|5.0|Being away from home can be a strong link between two people who share it. Moreover, the experience of being away, in a strange land (just like the characters in this movie or the protagonists in [[ASIN:B004WLJJ1E Trippers]]) can push people to discover things in themselves that otherwise they couldn't acknowledge in the comfort of \\"home.\\"<br /><br />Bill Murray's performance in this definitely ranks among his best, probably at the very top. Scarlett Johansson's screen time fares just as well, deserving the notion that this was her true \\"breakthrough\\" to stardom. The chemistry the two actors have while wearing the skin of their characters isn't all-out electric, but rather subtle and constrained--more of a minor static-energy shock than a lightning strike. Yet, that's precisely the tone that the story needed: two strangers stranded in a strange land, not quite nostalgic about home but concerned about finding themselves. And all against the backdrop of a Tokyo that flashes perfectly as a place of rampant exoticism and impersonal feel.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie deserved all the praise and critical acclaim that it received back in its day.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is the only game I turn my sound ON for, it is my bathtub game to play to relax me. I love this game.
B005VJ8ATS|5.0|This was easily among the best movies of 2011. Like all good genre films, its sci-fi element is just an excuse to explore a deeper topic--that of identity and solitude in the world. It's all a matter of shared solitude and the renewed opportunities that a new location, such as a whole new planet Earth, can afford to those looking for second chances, reset buttons, and a companion to take that leap (a similarity in premise shared with the dramedy [[ASIN:B004WLJJ1E Trippers]] and the highly-acclaimed [[ASIN:B001NLCBJI Lost in Translation]]). Both main characters (especially Brit Marling's) struggle to find their place in the world, though for different reasons: she has to redefine herself after the accident and all the guilt she carries, while he has to endure the daily burden of not having his family anymore. Even when the story is hardly filled with happy feelings, by the end the audience ought to feel inspired towards a more uplifting and hopeful vision of this Earth, regardless, or perhaps because, of the promise given by another Earth.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Not the greatest movie ever made but I enjoyed it. Iron Sky is bound to become a cult classic!<br /><br />Nazi's from outer space what's not to like?
B0031R5K8G|5.0|I loved this story, it was very insightful and a great aid to understanding someone with a disability. That aside, the story itself was intense and I was genuinely worried about the outcome. It made me laugh, get teary and reflect on my own life and social interactions.

0307278255|5.0|I always like Jhumpa Lahiri's work. This is an easy-reading, gentle set of short stories with Lahiri's usual subject matter of Indians and their cultural adjustments to Western life, generational conflict, etc. The final set of stories is somewhat heartbreaking in many ways. She's great at creating characters and settings and bringing the little tiny things in life out to reveal culture. I enjoyed the book and learned more about Bengalis than I had known before.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game has good graphics ... is fun and an excellent way to pass the time...great game if you love puzzles
0316666343|5.0|Let's face it: the topic of this book is not fun.  It is about the death of a young girl and the parents' search for her and her killer.  Somehow, though, you don't finish the book feeling depressed.  You leave feeling good about the relationship she had with her father, and the love that exists in her family.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I ignored all of the horrible reviews. I wouldn't recommend this book if it were free! This was an abusive relationship, not cute in any way. I love erotic romance and have never disliked a book so much to write a bad review. Until this one. I am shocked that a movie is being made.  Nothing but 'crap' in this novel. At least every other paragraph...
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|An absolutely awesome movie - I was not even into most of this music in 80's but after seeing this movie, they are now my favorites, and the actors/actresses did an outstanding job with the music.<br />One of the best \\"feel good\\" movies of 2012, just anxious to get my copy of the cd - ordered recently.<br /><br />Plus if you get the movie, which I did from Amazon, pre ordered it, I guarantee you will laugh you *** off.<br /><br />Great music !!!!
0307943232|5.0|Sometimes I read either on my kindle or a real live, something I can turn pages on book, and at times I listen to audio books. This particular Grisham book I received on audio and couldn't wait to start listening. I usually listen to help me fall asleep but not with this one, it was an all nighter. This story is amazing and I highly recommend it to any and all readers. It is spellbinding and the twist and turns make for one you cannot listen or read part way it is a must finish, I tried but fell asleep once which is okay because the next night it was completed. After I finished I quickly went to my library and pulled out two earlier audio's by John Grisham so I guess I will either have to go to bed earlier or sleep in late the next morning.  Do not let this one get by you.<br /><br />As stated in most of my reviews, I am not qualified to get into saying whether the author is good or bad. I am just a reader of stories and if I think someone else will enjoy the book as much as I do I recommend it. I do not pretend to be a professional and if I do not have something good to say I do not review.
B005KB0SU6|4.0|Vale la pena leerlo después de la Sombra del Viento, y antes del Prisionero del Cielo y aunque son historias independientes, las tres se relacionan mucho y hacen disfrutar más los libros.

B003YJEXL6|5.0|In our modern, Western society, the differences and roles of the two genders is everywhere. From what men and women dress in to their roles in everyday life and even the type of personality they are expected to have. However, in Delusions of Gender, author Cordelia Fine disputes the conventional viewpoint of the genders.<br /><br />Fine gives several examples on how males and females differ in society and how these differences are more likely to be traced to cultural origins. She disputes the idea that babies are born with \\"hardwired\\" differences between the genders. An example might be that young children are supposed to play with certain toys that conform with gender differences. We are all familiar with them: girls play with dolls and tea sets while boys play with toy trucks and spaceships. However, these differences are instead taught by society starting from the minute a baby is born.<br /><br />These differences become ingrained in popular thinking leading men and women later in life to act differently depending on how they are taught about gender stereotypes. For example, Fine explains how women might do worse than men on a test if they are told beforehand that science has shown that is simply the case. However, no such difference is noted between women and men if they are given a more gender-neutral explanation beforehand.<br /><br />Fine also looks at how sexism has sometimes skewed the results of scientific studies. She criticizes many such attempted studies that examine gender differences as being incomplete or simply flawed and the dangerous precedent of releasing this incorrect information for popular consumption.<br /><br />In conclusion, I found this to be a fascinating and enlightening look at the origins, and sometimes misinformation, regarding gender differences and stereotypes in modern society. I would recommend this book to those interested in learning about gender differences and roles.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Judi Dench is at her best in this charming little film. The rest of the cast are great too. As a senior making life changes, I can fully identify with many of them.

Her favorite ( and mine) was The Great Fairy Rescue but I have to say, thanks to Disney's amazing creativity, the new Secret of the Wings has to be the best!! We loved the whole story line with the new fairies and how they came to be. This is def one to buy if your a big fan like we are! You won't be dissapointed, def worth the money to buy as you will be watching it over and over with your little one. As for adults, you can sit and enjoy it just as much as the children. Buy it!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book! I have never read a book this fast and somewhat regretting how fast I read it. Wow great that I have to wait a while for book number 3.,
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a perfect game for a touch screen tablet. A simple idea beautifully executed. A must have for Kindle Fire owners!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books were better. I felt the third was unsatisfying and the ending confusing and half hearted.  The author seemed to run out of steam and wrapped it all up in a messy package.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't know what to do after fifty shades and I was told to check  this out... now I'm lost again... and gotta wait... not cool ma...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Has been fun and very addictive since the first time this app came out.  Can't stop playing I end up having to put my phone on the charger because I run the battery down.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|He never really developed the main character the way he always does so that you get to know him and like him. I really didn't care if the character won or lost. I was really disappointed. I have read every book he's written at least once but not this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy.  The book is much deeper than just the sexual content, no pun intended.  Such a dark character that Christian Grey is and how one individual can be life saving in so many aspects, the physical and the emotional. I might just have to read the trilogy again.
0738727326|5.0|Beautiful tarot cards.  Highly recommend these for reading.  My clients love them and the depictions are acurate as they are lovely.
B002VUFKG6|4.0|It was kinda like a text book at times but I liked the story, I liked her first book so I understood the background.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|My husband and I  really like Tom Selleck' movies. He does not do junk movies. He is especially great in Westerns!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book is three distinct sections: A historical look at Yemen; The search for the Panther; and, lastly, any encounters that may happen.  The golden thread that brings all three sections together are the hilarious one-liners by the John Corey character.  They are very timely and well written.  The whole book is clearly about the John Corey character - its the reason many of us like the DeMille books - we enjoy the way John Corey verbalizes what we are actually thinking and feeling. The reader will learn much about Yemen as a country and why it is so difficult dealing with and in countries like this. It's clear that DeMille has no patience with much of what goes on in this part of the world - Maybe things would be better if we had a few more John Corey's!
0792839730|5.0|Excellent movie...<br />My husband is really into history and wars.He has watched this movie often, so I surprised him with his very own. He can watch it anytime he wants to, now.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I am not one to write music reviews, but felt compelled to do so after listening to this album about three times now and sharing it with everyone in my family that would take the time to listen with me!  Wow!  I can't say enough about these guys.  Utterly in love with this album and already planning to buy the expanded 2 Disc version that will be coming out later this month.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I had forgotten how great this movies was! You must see this again before seeing \\"Skyfall\\".<br />The combo DVD/Blue Ray is only $9.99 and it came with a $10 coupon for the theater.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|good waste of time if I had to pay would not bother pretty much what it sounds like with a few cute features
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Great twist on a classic game. Fun to play with good replay value. As another reviewer commented, I often lost the ball while chasing other things on the screen. Smooth game play on my tablet. If you like retro games, this one is well worth the download.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|He is green and mean and righteous. Bad aliens watch out cuz  you are going to get thumped! Black widow is cute too!
0425263916|4.0|I gave Bared to You a 5 star, but this only a 4 star.  Im hoping the next book will be more like the first.  Still a great read.
B005H29GSI|2.0|My 8 year old played with this maybe twice. The blocks are difficult to stack, they don't stay stacked very well and the catapult is hard to aim/shoot. I thought she would love this game and the concept seemed fun to me, however I think the poor mechanics of the materials took away most of the fun.
1476712042|3.0|I just finished this book and wondered why it got so many 5 star ratings.  My thought is that they were from younger readers in their 20s.  After reading 50 Shades of Grey, Gabriels Inferno and Bared to You, this was a Big disappointment.  It certainly should not be labeled in the Romance Erotica section, since there wasnt anything erotica about it.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|The reviews for this movie seem to be all over the place. Some love it, some hate it, and some are in between. With a movie like this you just have to check out out for yourself to see if you like it. Me personally, I loved it. The cast were all great. Johnny Depp pulls off his wonderful weird routine as usual, along with Helena! Chloe was great, she is just a incredible young actress. I also personally enjoyed the cameo from Alice Cooper! Tim Burtons style works great for this movie! So I recommend that you check this out, but rent it first before you buy it, just to be sure it is your kind of movie!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A delightful movie aimed at those over or nearing 50, however, those still on their way to 50 will also enjoy it. Beside the heart warming stories and adventures of the seniors, a wonderful thread of young love weaves its way through out. Included along the way are good laughs, some pathos and an interesting look at Indian culture. A must see!!!
1423101502|4.0|For those with school-aged kids, and especially those who like their classical mythology alive and kicking, THE LAST OLYMPIAN, book five of the Percy Jackson series by mystery/YA author Rick Riordan, was released in 2009. My sons and I took turns reading it, and we agree that it was quite good.<br /><br />This is the final book of the first series about the adventures of half-blood kids who are the sons and daughters of Greek gods. Percy, son of Poseidon, and his friends Annabeth, Grover, and about forty young demigods must hold Mount Olympus (the Empire State building) from the onslaught of Kronos the titan while Zeus and Company are in the midsection of the U.S. battling the titan Typhon, who looks like a massive, eastward moving storm system to The Weather Channel. For a final book of a series, Riordan has plotted this one out very well and tied up all his loose ends -- more than I can say for lots of series authors. Plenty of action here, maybe a little too much in that final battle sequence that takes up about half of the book, but characters make some gut-wrenching choices, and there's a lot of emotion, plus the usual sprinkling of humor. Books 3 and 4 of the series were a little slow for me, so I'm glad Riordan ended with panache.<br /><br />If you haven't read the series yet, I recommend starting at the beginning, with THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Riordan is writing a YA series about Roman gods in which Percy Jackson appears, and Riordan also has a YA series about the Egyptian gods.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found this book was very easy to read. I wish Katniss was more adventurous during the hunger games. She seemed so bold until she entered the games.
B004V5A7K8|1.0|At first, I liked this game, the multi-ball happened, there were balls flying everywhere! It brought back memories of when I was a kid and I had to clean the men's bath house in San Francisco, there were balls all over the place there too!<br /><br />The reason I am giving it one star is not because of balls flying all over the place, it is because this game is a total rip off of that one old game!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The hunger games is an interesting series. I just wish it had a little more action for me. Loved it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Works great. Love it.. Makes my iPod louder and easier to play drums to my favorite music. iPod wasn't loud enough before, plugged this amp into iPod and boom.... Much louder... Love it.
B000B5Y00U|5.0|Montserrat Caballe sang the best rendition of Violetta in my lifetime! Her artistry (phrasing, breathing, etc) along with her partner Carlo Bergonzi is impecable! The very best!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put it down, even for a bathroom break. The story flows and unfolds at exactly the right place. I read and reread some passages astonished by the words.  Highly enjoyable and reread able.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read these books as they were all the hype! Great books to read for sure and then talk about with your friends! Love them!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I thought the story would develop into something more thought provoking and maybe different from 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I did ,however, enjoy the characters - the tortured teenager, for whom death would be release, and the arrogant, rich old guy, for whom death would be defeat.<br />It was a quick read, and overall enjoyable.  I just had bigger expectations for the ending.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Killer vintage guitar tones abound - \\"Tone, Taste & Tenacity\\".  Listen for yourself - if you like the samples you'll love the album. (It's 67 minutes long - even if you don't like a few of the songs there's plenty there to be excited about - personally I don't skip a single track).
B0096HIEE2|2.0|i like most of the actors in the movie but their pretty faces and hot bods just wasn't enough. if there were part sthat made all the scenes flow together they were left on the cutting room floor. the dancing was, ofcourse the best part. the sister stayed grumpy until the last 5 minutes of the movie. the club owner should not have performed in the movie at all. everybody but the lead guy seemed liked an extra. that is really sad becuase we all know from their other shows that they can atleast read more than 5 lines each. i think tarzan didn't speak the whole movie.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Iam a fan of several of the male actors, but from the poor sounds, poor shot selection, editing, complete lack of plot and poor choice of female lead, I wish I could request a refund. I feel badly for the A list actors who will forever have this as part of their resume....yikes !
B002UEW31I|5.0|Extremely watchable time and time again!!  Artistic and intelligent.  Pure Tarantino entertainment!  The acting is superb!!  This review needs five more words.
B009IJJ712|4.0|The BBC was in a snit when CBS decided to rip off their concept of Holmes in a modern metropolis. Well, all credit to CBS. They pulled it off. Elementary isn't as glossy and sophisticated as the BBC effort led by Benedict Cumberbatch. But it's a first-rate procedural with crisp writing, good photography, and top-notch performances by Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu. Apparently it's doing well in the ratings, too. I look forward to seeing many more episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this on kindle fire it works great all it needs now is... wolves mincarts and redstone and caves otherwise. this is a great app! :)
B005LAIHPY|3.0|There are holes here you could fly a giant space alien star cruiser through. Taylor Kitsch as a doofus screwup slacker who within a short span of time becomes a naval officer who is still a screwup who becomes a brilliant hero guy. (I must admit, I do not get Taylor Kitsch, who presided over another huge bomb this year, John Carter.) Transmissions to the stars that apparently travel faster than light. Invading space aliens who won't kill you unless their sensor thingies flash red instead of green. (Why not just kill everyone?) Aliens who can travel across space at faster than light who fight by using what's essentially old-fashioned artillery. A WWII battleship (the great Mighty Mo) brought to battle readiness within a few hours by several current naval personnel and a troop of old geezers, complete with shells and powder. My wife couldn't wait for this movie to be over, and I don't blame her. But still, it's fun sci-fi entertainment that's good for some laughs and thrills.<br /><br />But having said all this, there are a few chuckles and thrills to be had. Think of it as a very wet Independence Day, out upon the ocean waves. Some good sci fi eye candy here. I thought the aliens were well done (except for their weird red light/green light thing.) And I did enjoy seeing the USS Missouri dish out hell to the alien mother ship.<br /><br />This is a movie for a 12-year-old boy; or the 12-year-old in us grownups.
B005MJARW0|5.0|I absolutely loved it! I began watching the third season just recently and the episode Poplika got me interested in seeing more of it. Of course I had to see how it all began. I loved the part where Danny punched Steve. It was hilarious watching a Detective from New Jersey clock a Navy Seal... something you don't expect anyone to have the guts to try, even a fictional tv character.  :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|will be excited to get this game and let my granddaughter play. hope to get this game free. hurry up.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The Album \\"Some Nights\\" by Fun is a mostly upbeat production that can really grow on you.  I purchased the album because of the songs \\"Some Nights\\" and \\"We are Young.\\" However, I have discovered that most of the album has great melody and rhythm.  The song \\"One Foot\\" has a bouncy sound that is really catchy.  This album is in heavy rotation on my MP3 player....BUY IT.. you won't be disappointed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a super fun game that requires hand eye coordination and skill. We have the free version. I am enjoying it and my grandson, age 8, loves it. That frog is soo cute. Each level is different - some are more difficult than others - each is a ton of fun.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is a fairly short review, and honestly, not a complete one. When I first caught word of this album earlier this year, I had hope, but it's not a hope that often comes to fruitation when you have and old favorite with (INMHO) his best band \\"Crazy Horse\\" and you long for the years gone by.<br /><br />I said this is not a complete review - I've been listening to Disc 1 ever since it hit the doorstep and I'll take the next step to Disc 2 soon, but the two longest songs on Disc 1 make me feel like I was allowed to sit in on an un-official jam session that neither the artist nor the listener wanted to end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to play yet requires a little thought. Works well on the Fire. A game you can pick up and play at any time.
B00881VLCE|2.0|it keeps crashing, the puzzles themselves are fun but I get tired of having to delete and reload the app. don't buy the puzzles because when it crashes you don't get to keep them.
B009ZQAN9I|5.0|LOVE it!  I find this much more scary than the first season.  Hope that it keeps on this way.  Jessica Lange is outstanding.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The giver was a fantastic book. I encourage all ages to read it. I think that high schools should allow this kind of book to be read in schools.  This book really touches peoples lives when they are having a rough life.  This book can really get your imagination thriving to make an imangary life that can help people theough the rough times in life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was amazing, each book was better than the first.  The author made the characters so real.  Books that can make you laugh and cry are an excellent read!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book is very well written and you end up really caring for the characters. It has a lot of lyrical prose and makes you think about your own mortality. Excellent read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Well the most addicting game ever! so fun! fhfyfy hfhfyf highfalutin yfh hcb hcg ycv tc t tvgv gg g g v vxg ggc.  ggcv
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have been a fan of Kay Scarpetta since Postmortem and have read each of her books.  While I am always impressed with Cornwell's prose and ability to tie several crimes together in a wicked weave, I am weary of how narcisstic Kay has become.  I find it detracts from the story line.  Also, by mid book I had figured how who was responsible for the murders and why; and even had predicted an unexpected connection with a seemingly unrelated crime. I swore that I would not spend money on another Scarpetta novel after Port Mortuary (snooze) but the reviews for this book made it sound like it was back to basics.  Maybe I will stick to her cookbook...
B008VPC9WS|2.0|I bought this book because is supposed to have full lenght examples of the exam, but the book did not have any funtion to use any type of program. Nor a CD rom.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Getting the obvious out of the way here.. Tommy is a fantastic replacement for Roy. He sounds like a younger Roy, and moves like him, but he's just different enough to distinguish himself.<br /><br />I have seen some complain that this album is too much like other Kamelot albums, which is both right, and wrong. It's still undeniably identifiable as Kamelot, so if you're sick of their stuff, this won't change your mind. However, some songs do help make this album stand out from the rest of their catalog, and show that they aren't entirely resting on their laurels. It's a small progression, but it's the right one for a band that already stands out from other bands in the genre.<br /><br />The album itself almost feels like a combination of Black Halo, Ghost Opera, and Poetry for the Poisoned. To me, this creates what might be their best album. I won't say with certainty that it's my favorite yet, purely because it is so new. What I will say, though, is that odds are looking good that it will overtake Black Halo for me.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I love this so much it helps me out a ton with staying organized and taking notes as well as keeping notes organized for school it also saves paper :) . Although it could have a few better designs and the way its laid out I love it and use it daily.
1451662432|4.0|Great book, insightful read. Newfound respect for Arnold! He provides an honest recollection of life events, including controversial ones. Many of us view him as the Terminator, a robotic killer whose strength knows no bounds. Some might remember his tenure as California governor. Whatever opinion we may have of Arnold, the raw description of his journey commands a certain level of respect and admiration.
B00005R23S|5.0|I've seen Bruce somewhere between 20 and 40 times live, and I've seen several video performances too.  The one performance that stands out above all others on this DVD is \\"Atlantic City\\" and for that one song alone this DVD is a must-have.  The band is tight and the sound is outstanding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just got my new kindle fire hd and wanted a book that would catch my interest and had heard a lot of people talking about what a great book it was. I totally agree!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Mmmmm .... Love me some Batman!!!<br /><br />Check out \\"How It Should Have Ended\\" on YouTube!!!<br /><br />Link to \\"How The Dark Knight Rises\\" Should Have Ended...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I'm Batman...
B009NQKPUW|4.0|very good movie as only Ridley Scott can do. the visual effects and storyline all worked well. I would reccommend this movie
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Mmmm ... Love me some Batman...<br /><br />Check out \\"How It Should Have Ended\\" on YouTube...<br /><br />Here is the link to \\"How The Dark Knight Rises Should Have Ended\\" ...<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I'm Batman
0385737955|1.0|I have to say that I am 37 and I bought this book based on the good reviews and the comparison to The Huger Games (which I enjoyed and recommend). But it has been a total let down. You don´t get to grow attached to the characters. There are no twists or surprises. There is no story to tell really.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Mmmmm ... Love me some Ironman!!!<br /><br />Check out \\"How It Should Have Ended\\" on Youtube ...<br /><br />Look for the video for \\"How The Avengers Should Have Ended\\" ...<br /><br />Hey, does anyone like Shwarma ???
B009KHDT0C|5.0|If you like Johnny Depp, you will like this movie. If you watched Dark Shadows years ago, you will like this movie. It is funny & entertaining.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario but on kindle and touch still entertaining however I do not rate games often but took mu time to rate this one
B0098VXE50|5.0|I love the movie, scenery & costumes. The extended version is just a few minutes more in a couple of places. Buy the movie because it is entertaining, not because of an extended edition.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was afraid the optimism streaming out of pianoguys might get lost with the picture,however their music is enough to take you away. This is a must.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a writing masterpiece. Once you pick it up I promise you won't want to put it down.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The movie was wonderful with a great message.  A great family movie that will keep your interest for all ages.
034580404X|5.0|The books were fun,intriguing,sexual,buy most of all a great read. I finished reading all 3 books in less than week. I hope the author writes a book(s) from Christian's perspective!! Loved the books!!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Neat game with different levels. Love it that the ball changes color with each different color block it hits. Runs great on the DROID 2:
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is phenomenal. It's a great game to relaxed to. enjoyable.  fun game.<br /> love the game. keep up the good work. and keep it coming.
B009439E7O|5.0|i'm going to keep this review short and sweet and just say that this album KILLS on all levels. fantastic new outing from the jersey boys. it's fast, heavy, melodic, aggressive, and in your face. not a bad track on the whole album and NO ballads. i got this in the mail today and have already listened to it twice. they have lessened the \\"latin\\" influence on this album and upped the aggressive energy. a welcome change.<br />it's a killer new album that certainly deserves your ten bucks. the only downside to it is there are NO lyrics or band pics in the booklet. actually its a poster, not a booklet. but thats a small flaw thats easily overlooked.<br />if you were ever an ILL NINO fan and wanted to know what they were up to now, get this record.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing,,,, after book one,,,, can't wait to read book three!  My friends tell me they liked this one over Fifty Shades of Grey,,,, and that was hard to top!
B008SVS3FC|3.0|John Hiatt is a frustrating artist to me, he can write a witty scorching soul/blues/rocker and follow it up with some cornpone crap. He can write a deep heartfelt ballad and then write a cliche filled snoozer. I have been a fan since Bring<br />The Family and Slow Turning, I lost track of him for a time after Little Head. The albums Open Road and Dirty Jeans... brought me back into the fold, both are brilliant and have some of his deepest songwriting on them; Homeland, Like a Freight Train, Hold On For Your Love, and Down Around My Place are all classics.<br />  I find it hard to understand why there are so many 5 star reviews for this album,<br />there are scant few songs that can hold a candle to his best work. We're Alright Now<br />is a keeper, Give It Up and One of Them Damn Days are well written songs, but I<br />find this CD to be his most boring since Same Old Man, SORRY.<br />  I am still waiting for an album by Mr. Hiatt that can stand next to Walk On- I am still a huge fan, just not of this particular collection of songs.
B0019NG73G|5.0|I can say that I have watched this movie many times and enjoy it each time. One can understand the feelings, anxiety, and courage of those soldiers. Great cast and very well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, I wanted more ! And now after the second one I cannot wait to.read.the third!  So.addicting.and so.so.good!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this application wonderful.  I can read and I can also use it audio.  I used it once for my Teen SS class and had the application read the scriptures to my class.  I would feel lost without it.  Before I bought my first Kindle I looked at eReaders from other companies.  I enjoy the Amazon experience.  I also have the audible application.  Knitting and listening to an audible book or this Bible ap...pure relaxation.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My entire family has enjoyed this season's DVD and now my husband's secretary and her family are also enjoying these episodes!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all  Lee Childs novels. I look forward to each release but this time I was very disappointed . It was slow moving with a flat ending. It was like Lee Child churned it out to make a buck.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|absolutely love this game!!! can not get enough!  animation is incredible and the characters are sooooo cute!  User friendly too.
B004WKI204|1.0|I find the book totally boring and written very badly.  It has not captivated me at all and in fact I haven't even wanted to finish the book.  Total waste of money.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game great graphics great animation!!  perfect for every age - love it and so do my kids!!!  whoop whoop
B005LAIH4A|3.0|It has a permanent skip at the beginning and the menu doesn't have words i.e. scenes, special features etc, it just has pictures. Other than that, it's ok. The delivery time was awesome.
B00389XV42|5.0|Funny<br />Slightly poignant<br />And action-packed<br /><br />Enjoy this fun and entertaining romp through the annals of nerd-dom. A dram come true for a wanna-be spy.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|The bag is very nice for a nice price but a little small. Great value overall. I recommend this bag to value seekers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent service and fast shipping. I loved the Hunger Game Series and loved reading the Mockingjay! I am looking forward to reading another series by Suzanne Collins. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a review by my daughter. I love playing this game. Hours of fun. This is hard to put down.
B008KE3960|5.0|this game is way funner  funner than i ever imagined. it is also very addicting and I love the controlls. the graphics are also very good. I would highly recommend this game!
072325804X|5.0|Beatrice Potter \\"The Complete Tales\\" is the most wonderful and charming children's book that I've ever read. The stories are so innocent and sweet. I really love the illustrations and the book is beautifully formatted. It comes inside a hardback cover. Also. This book would make an excellent baby shower gift. Children who love animals and nature would be especially drawn to this book and it's wonderful tales. For children and adults alike, this is a great book and every child should have one.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|Some of the worst writing in human history went into this movie. If you want to see every character act like a complete idiot to push a badly thought out plot along, get this movie!<br /><br />Special effects were, of course, extraordinary. If only they had hired a writer instead of the closet full of monkeys...
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I loved breakaway and this is a visually stunning update to the old classic.<br />The vibrant blocks are arranged in different patterns for each level.  The background patterns are varied and keep the game interesting.  The falling bonuses are fun!  Watch out for the red circle with a minus sign.  It took me a while to realize that when you catch one, your paddle shrinks!<br />This game plays beautifully on my Kindle Fire using a stylus.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|puzzles were fairly simple. a lot of running back and forth. ending leaves it open to continue. I really liked this game
B008O9V24W|5.0|2nd albums are the acid  test of a band. \\"Come of Age\\" builds on the freshness of \\"What did you expect...\\", with more varied, deeper musicality, which continues to show the talent and brilliance of the Vaccines. The music shows some similarity to their previous effort, with enough new style to show they are not stuck in a rut. the Vaccines music is growing up. Coming of age indeed.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I had to delete it twice because it bought things and characters I didn't want to buy. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|it was so awesome I love dragon story! I want it to last forever and ever happy happy happy happy happy
B005LAIIDU|5.0|From the start, it pays homage to my old school generation of gamers (but includes some new gen stuff as well), has a sophisticated and involving plot, non-childish humor, an outstanding sound track, and phenomenal character development. But that's just the surface.<br /><br />What puts this animation a notch above most others in its type are the attention to all these details (of instance, the pixel characters in Ralph's game move in flash animation, no fluid animation, it's such a treat).<br /><br />I won't spoil *any* of the story, because it *needs* to be seen, and not knowing any of it before hand, trailers aside, will be WORTH IT in the end. My title really is the theme of how I feel about this film.<br /><br />I'm an emotional guy but wear a hard mask of apathy the vast majority of the time. This movie, at least for its duration, broke that mask into pieces. Go now. Watch it. You will buy it on Bluray if you have one when it comes out.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|One of the worst books I've ever read. Purchased it as part of a book club, and couldn't get into it from page one through a reading of 75 percent when I had to give up. For one thing, the overall topic is redundant since we  know wha really happened; the time travel twist is ineffective. Also, there is little if any character development. A boring book throughout and definitely not a tribute to Stephen King, who usually writes a compelling story.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this for a bookclub as I normally would not read a YA title. It was a wonderful story that made me smile, laugh, and really cry. Have a box of tissues by your side. I loved it and was happy it was the selected title by my co-worker.
0230754686|5.0|The story of this young man's life in Camp 14 makes the Freddie horror movies sound like a picnic.  They weren't treated like human beings but more like mindless cattle.  It is heartbreaking.  Not only is the man's life there insufferably horrible, but his struggle to learn how to feel, trust and love in a free society is a struggle those of us who grew up free cannot imagine.  This is a book every American should read.  It is revealing and educational.  How many of us are aware of the organizations giving support to the N.Korean escapees?  This book not only covers the struggles of these people but informs us about the impact of the free world on N.Korea.  Thank you to the author for caring and sharing.
0547564651|5.0|I saw this book advertised and thought it would be a good resource to help us raise our children. This book exceeded every expectation I had. It demonstrated how hard work and a thoughtful approach to raising children can have a profound impact on their success. The book talks about how important nurturing is to children early in their life. In the section about character he talks about a list of seven words that kids need to build character to include Grit, Self-Control, Zest, Social Intelligence, Gratitude, Optimism, and Curiosity. The more we can instill these traits in our children the higher their chances of success and independence later in life.  This book would be great for anyone who deals with children on a regular basis from educators to coaches to parents. Hats off to the author Paul Tough!

1439152802|5.0|I was sceptical about this book, based on the blurb on the back cover, but I decided to give it a go because I liked Morton's earlier work. Thankfully, The Secret Keeper is a riveting mystery, filled with great characterisation and a very strong central question that kept me guessing from the first page to the last.<br /><br />Dorothy, the main character, is at the heart of the story and it's ultimately her problems that drive the narrative. It's quite rare to find such a well-written protagonist who is able to push the story onwards, but Dorothy has a secret that I found fascinating from the moment it was first hinted at. I'm not going to say any more about that, because I think the nature of the plot means that you really should go into the novel unspoiled. Let's just say that Dorothy is a very original character with a fascinating dilemma that doesn't immediately offer any hints as to how it could be resolved.<br /><br />The backdrop is mid 20th century England. Morton brings to life a very particular period in English history, running through some of the more turbulent years. I thought she did a good job of linking the character of Dorothy to the time in which the story is set. This book doesn't just happen to be set during these years; instead, the characterisations, plot and setting are all inextricably linked. This means that The Secret Keeper feels like a very satisfying book. Morton manages to maintain the complicated story while not making it too complex. Well worth a read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many, but not all, of his works. I love his style as it keeps you turning the pages. This was by far the best I have ever read. Maybe because I remember \\"the day\\" when I was a child, but I think I enjoyed it more because it was so well written, and made you stop and think about what you would do if given the chance. When a book keeps coming to your mind after you have finished it, there is something special about it. Thank you Mr. King!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|First, I'm a senior citizen, 72 years of age, and should be living in an old folks home if I acted my age. So, what's wrong with me?  I enjoy comic books; or, at least, I used to. Growing up, I always wondered how a comic book would look on the silver screen, in a live action movie. Some of my favorites were Batman, Superman and a few others with the DC label. I wasn't all that familiar with Marvel's comics.<br /><br />So, what brought me around to Marvel's comic books? Movies is the answer. I enjoy good movies and \\"Iron Man' was the first of many. I saw the \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" series, and enjoyed them. But, it wasn't until the \\"Iron Man\\" series that really caught my attention. I saw both in theaters and bought the DVD issues. Then came \\"Thor,\\" and enjoyed it, but not as much as \\"Iron Man.\\" I thought \\"Hulk\\" was a little silly. I wasn't at all familiar with Captain America (until I saw the movie), Black Widow or Hawkeye; and Nick Fury was only a faded memory. But \\"The Avengers\\" brought them all together.<br /><br />I will have to admit that \\"The Avengers\\" is a very enjoyable movie. It's loaded with action, humor, and a good story line. It doesn't matter if the story is a bio-pic or entirely fiction, it must be a good story to make me enjoy it. If the story is weak (\\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" is a good example), the movie will fall apart, usually early. The next are the production values put into the story. There must be a good reason for an actor to do something. This is where \\"The Avengers\\" shine. It is a well crafted movie.<br /><br />When I see a movie, I put a very high value on what I'm about to see. I had extremely high values on \\"The Avengers\\" and it didn't disappoint me in any way. I paid the going rates for seniors at the local Bijou, sat down with my popcorn and drink. The theater darkened and the usual trailers led me into the main feature. To make a long story longer, I thoroughly enjoyed every frame of \\"The Avengers.\\" I laughed, I cried; but, I didn'tkiss twenty bucks good-bye. Leaving the theater, I thought that I needed to buy the DVD. When my Blu-Ray package arrived, it went into the player and I enjoyed it over again. In the two weeks that I've had \\"The Avengers\\" in my movie library, I've probably watched it a dozen times. If this keeps up, I'll have to replace it by the end of the year, as I would have worn out the original copy.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray disc is loaded with all of the extras you would expect; but, this has more. I'm really pleased with Amazon's delivery system. I ordered the disc with standard shipping (I'm cheap), and it arrived three days later. WOW! That was fast. I would highly recommend buying \\"The Avengers\\" from Amazon.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Loved the movie at the show and it looks and sounds great on my flat screen at home. This movie has a lot to connections to the original Alien and to the books. Anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies should love this one. It's sort of a prequel with many of the tie ins to what happens later (or 30 years ago for us). It also adds more elements of 2001 a space oddesy and Event Horizon. Great story with lots of action and special effects but most importantly it's Ridley Scott and he is an awesome director.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|Generally, I don't like westerns as a whole; but, there are a few stand-outs. The Clint Eastwood spaghetti western trio, \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Silverado\\" are in my favorites library. (I have over 2,000 DVDs and Blu-Ray movies in my collection.) The movie has to be good to get added. So, what makes a good movie? First, the story must be plausible. Next, production values must be high. There must be a good reason for an actor to do something. Just chewing up the scenery doesn't count.  So, where does \\"Silverado\\" fit into this?<br /><br />I wouldn't class \\"Silverado\\" as a conventional western. It's a \\"buddy flick\\" in a western setting. Here, we have four guys that meet up under unusual circumstances, group together, and travel from point A to point B. What happens during their travels is interesting, enjoyable and entirely plausible.  When \\"Silverado\\" was released in 1985, I bought the VHS copy on a friend's recommendation. This was a great story and a good movie. The bad part, if there is one, is that I've gone through a couple of dozen of VHS machines; and even my latest has begun to fail. So, what's to do? Buy a DVD or Blu-Ray player, which Ive done. Now, I'm replacing my VHS movies with, either, DVDs or Blu-Rays.<br /><br />Another bad thing happened. My 27 inch CRT TV set failed; so, I was in the market for a new TV set. I got a great deal on a new flat screen; but, it was a whole lot larger than what I actually wanted. I had to make room for a 42 inch TV. My audio system was put together over the years, and includes two three-way speaker systems with 12 inch drivers; which I use for the front channels. My rear speakers are a pair of two-way systems with eight inch drivers; and I added a center channel system and sub-woofer (which is a story in itself). Everything is being driven by a 125 watt per channel receiver. It's not top-of-the-line; but it ain't junk either. It's all upper mid-level.  Putting \\"Silverado\\" through the system was better than seeing it in a theater.<br /><br />Since \\"Silverado\\" was one of the movies at the top of my list, I got the Blu-Ray issue. I bought it through Amazon and a few days later, it arrived.  I put the disc in the player, sat back and relaxed. I was blown out of my seat. The picture was ten times better on the flat screen than it was on my old CRT; and the audio was stupendous. I would highly recommend \\"Silverado\\" as a movie, either on DVD or Blu-Ray, with the Blu-Ray being the preferred choice. And, buy it through Amazon. Not only for the price; but for the service Amazon has.  It's extremely difficult to beat.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Director must have a thing for Tatum. 2 movies in a row that's boring and missed the mark in the genre.  Other actors get zero lines and almost no screen time. Tatum has a hot bod and he can dance. But all the interactions with love interest and the kid have no chemistry. Was not entertained. Watch Step Up instead forTatum's  dancing and 21 Jump Street for comedy. Don't waste your money on this.

B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this game for my five-year-old nephew who's an Angry Bird nut. He saw this game on YouTube and begged me to get it for him. Honestly, I had my reservations at first; I didn't know how well it would work in this hands-on version. I was pleased to know it's not bad.<br /><br />Granted, the catapult isn't as fluid as the app version; at times the birds would veer off-course, but it's still loads of fun. My nephew created his own towers without looking at the cards. He enjoyed putting up the blocks even though it took a bit of time. In my opinion, this game spurred his creativity. He uses the minature angry birds as his own little action figures.<br /><br />At times, I caught him creating his own little storyline on how the green, evil piggies stole the eggs. His only gripe was that he wished the game came with the white, blue, and green angry birds. I'm slightly disappointed Mattel didn't include all the birds. All in all, this is a fun game. Since receiving it today, he's been playing it for two hours straight. If your child loves the app, then s/he will surely enjoy this game.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|If you're a fan of computer animation, this is a great treat! The amount of detail and skill shown in creating this movies was simply amazing to me. The story itself could have simply fallen flat or been so overly comedic (or to some...repulsive-ie. rats in a kitchen) that it wouldn't even warrant viewing, but I found that to be far from the case. Very entertaining and quite visually stunning as well. Glad I purchased it in Blu-ray.... quite incredible!!

0345410025|5.0|Once upon a time, books were extremely expensive, and people had trained memories.  50+ foreign languages were taught in Shakespeare's London- 200 years before the first dictionary.  How?  Trained memories.  But sometime in the 30's, they decided this was \\"rote learning\\".  My father taught me some of these methods.  He mastered a difficult foreign language, in the military, during the Korean War.  He learned them from his father.  Yes, you can memorize anything.  However, the mental training of doing so is FUN!  Yes, FUN!  It's like using a funnel with the narrow end up, for a long time, then discovering that having the wide end up makes like so much easier.  I love this book.  I recommend it at least once weekly to students.

044024630X|4.0|Book 16, in the Jack Reacher series<br /><br />\\"The Affair\\" is effectively a step back in time to 1997, the single most crucial point in Reacher's life, when he gave up his structured career as a military cop and decided to become a drifter with skills to offer. In this undercover adventure, he lets his hair grown long, lets his beard grow and adopts a minimalist way to travel. This eventually sets the stage for his new life.<br /><br />The plot is uncomplicated and exciting, it sends Reacher to Mississippi, where he will impersonate a care free traveller in order to ferret out those responsible for a secret American military mission in Kosovo that was totally botched and covered up by those involved.<br /><br />While in Carter Crossing, a small town near the military base, Reacher makes friends with the local sheriff, Elizabeth Deveraux and subsequently gets drawn into another mystery hence a sub-plot comes to life. Elizabeth's concern about the killings of several beautiful young women and the gruesome manner in which they were left to die piqued Reacher's interest, he felt he could be of assistance and could not resist getting involved even though he had a full plate with his primary mission.<br /><br />The author skillfully sets the atmosphere with strategically placed crisp strokes of the pen and the dialogue contains just enough slang to fit the scenes. There is no shortage of action, some very gruesome but each case is handled with tack without slowing the momentum. Our intrepid protagonist is definitely in full, over-the-top form, I like the testosterone driven anatomy comments that add a touch of humour while Reacher faces down two red neck tough guys in a pickup truck. The description of Reacher's amorous side is also a hoot.... I couldn't help but laugh at times .....<br /><br />I am a fan of this series and can't wait to see what will come next.

0393320928|4.0|\\"What Do You Care What Other People Think\\" seems to be a collection of addenda that, for whatever reason didn't fit into \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\\".<br /><br />The book starts off with some recollections from childhood. Feyman discusses how his dad inspired him to be curious about how the world works and \\"disrespectful\\" of authority, traits he attributes to being a successful scientist. It's an interesting discussion, especially for parents of young children. This leads into memories about his relationship with his first wife, Arlene, from mustering up the courage to ask her to dance, to her untimely death of TB.  This is a touching story of a beautiful relationship. Despite the fact that it's overshadowed by a terminal illness, the narrative remains refreshing and uplifting rather than moribund with sentiment and sadness. Next, we get some Feynman anecdotes in the vein of \\"Surely You're Joking\\", but they don't rise to the same level of wit and interest. It seems like these were the stories left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />The second part of the book (over half the book's length) discusses Feynman's involvement with the Presidential committee investigation the explosion of the Challenger spacecraft. Feyman is a self-professed bull in a china shop, running roughshod over red tape, bureaucratic procedure, and political sensitivities. It's interesting to see how Feynman thinks about an investigation and amusing to watch him chase down his pet theories. However, the cause of the explosion is basically known from the outset. which diffuses most of the dramatic tension of the narrative.<br /><br />The book concludes with a nice essay called \\"The Value of Science\\" in which Feyman contemplates science as the key to both \\"heaven and hell\\" in the world of practical applications. He also issues a rallying cry to promote science as a source of amazement and wonder rather than purely a practical concern.<br /><br />For fans of Feyman, this is definitely wortha read. It's a mostly light and breezy (some mildly technical stuff on rocketry aside) that's reasonably interesting throughout. There's something undeniably magical about viewing the world through Feynman's eyes. However, this is no \\"Surely You're Joking\\" which should definitely be read first.

B005CWRB44|5.0|fenix does it again!  barely bigger than the battery that powers it (awesome!).  with flashlights, size matters, but in the opposite way.  love the multiple mode option and the fact that medium is the first in the sequence.  definitely a very worthy light.  i put mine on a nite-ize clip, attached it to the belt loop on my work pants, and now i have a trusty back up at work.  the clip also stops the thing from rolling away if i drop it.  update 4/18/14:  after heavy use and nearly daily wear on my belt loop, this light has never failed to work correctly, has been as good a size as it can be while still fitting a cr123 battery, and has not needed any real maintenance.  i put high vacuum grease on the threads and the o-ring just because i can.  i added a star for longevity and reliability.  and i think that a clicky would get pushed accidentally since i have to crawl on and around machinery quite regularly.  update 3/22/15:  came to see about another one of these as gift.  there are an awful lot of reviews that state incredulity at getting a twisty switch.  pretty sure that is what the description says.  there seems to be some issues with some of these lights. i have never had an issue and have carried this for a long time on my belt loop at work.  at the price now it isnt much cheaper than a 47 of similar stature.  ah, inflation.
0061365343|5.0|Little House In The Big Woods is the first of nine books from author Laura Ingalls Wilder. In this book, we are introduced to the Ingalls family. Laura is a typical 5-year-old farm girl, adapting to life in the big woods of Wisconsin. Each day, Laura and her sister Mary must help with the daily chores. Her father must go out and hunt for food before winter so there will be plenty of fresh meat to eat. When the wolves howl at night, the sound of Pa's fiddle is a welcome comfort, along with stories and sometimes there is Laura's personal favorite game Mad Dog. Pa even surprises everyone by going into town for the first time and Laura is so overwhelmed she is absolutely speechless. There is even a dance at Laura's grandparents' house and she looks forward to spending Christmas with her cousins. She finally gets a rag doll of her own. Her longing for adventure often lands her in trouble. Though this work is fictional, it is based on the author's life as a Pioneer girl. It is a must have for any fan of any age.
B0087ITC56|4.0|This is actually a movie about the life of a pilot, one who makes an impossible landing to save the lives of most of the folks on the plane. So, the plane's crash landing is really secondary to the story of the life of the pilot. This is not the typical airplane crash movie.  Denzel plays an arrogant pilot who has been known to have a drink and is on a self-destructive path to the bone yard.<br /><br />The movie begins by letting you know that Denzel/Captain Whittaker partied before the flight with a lady.  He takes off in the morning, in a Southjet 227, with 102 people on board headed for Atlanta.  The storm causes a lot of turbulence as he climbs toward a clearing. You already know that the plane gets into trouble and has to crash land.<br /><br />The whole airplane sequence is at the beginning.  What really makes the movie is Denzel's performance as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation proceeds to determine the cause of the crash.  It is a top-notch performance by Denzel.<br /><br />John Goodman says he is Denzel's brother, but whether he is a brother or a business associate, he plays a colorful character.  We also meet a girl named Nicole, who definitely adds to the story line. Great performances by all, this was a really good movie to see.  Not an action film, but a powerful storyline.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is a great movie for all and a must see for kids, I enjoyed it as much as when i first saw it.
B009AMAM9S|3.0|I wavered between 3 and 4 stars on this flick, and settled on a 3, because I believed the movie just didn't quite connect all the dots for the viewer.  Possibly some meaningful pieces were removed on the editor's chop block.<br /><br />The underlying theme is reincarnation, how we live many lives and experience many different roles as we move from one lifetime to the next.  The film also demonstrates the polarity principle in our experiences.  We may be \\"good\\" in one lifetime, and \\"bad\\" in the next.  (We may also be a black male one time and a white female the next, or filthy rich one lifetime, and beggar poor the next.)  It is said that these things broaden our life experiences.  We can argue if they are true or not until the cows come home.<br /><br />There are other underlying themes in the movie that we are all connected, all have choices, and all decide what we want to accomplish in this lifetime before we are born.  Sometimes the roles we are given to play are for the greater good.  These are all concepts from many of the books I have personally read.  So, while I understood what the movie was saying, I felt it just did not quite bring the point home well enough.  The action parts of the movie picked up toward the end, and the summary at the end helped.  The movie also skipped around a lot, between the various reincarnated lifetimes of several characters.<br /><br />All-in-all, it was interesting, but. . . I also heard several people leaving the theater saying \\"they didn't get it.\\"  If I had not done a lot of reading on this stuff already, I'm not so sure I would have gotten it either.

It sets a mood that is perfect...That sad piano piece that Christian plays is haunting...<br /><br />@Terry: Thomas Tallis was Henry VIII's court composer, and was kind of a \\"Beatle\\" of his time, until he got accused of fooling around with Anne Boleyn...He's in the TV Series \\"The Tudors\\"...
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|I was very satisfied but surprised by this CD (a little ashamed it snuck under my radar for so long); 76 minutes of Bowie and The Spiders in peak form; great mastering; simple but nicely presented cover and insert, with a few concert snaps; a quote about the gig from Bowie; titles and their lengths and yet so inexpensive!<br />The concert, as is well documented, is a high-energy and historic snapshot of the brief and precious career of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. It's also another great example of David's huge singing ability certainly not being limited to his studio albums. And, as has been mentioned, the wonderful Mick Ronson was, and thanks to this finally officially released bootleg (many have had it for years, of course), IS tremendous throughout; playing arguably as good as any rock and roll guitarist of those times, before Bowie disbanded the group and Mick went back to landscape gardening with his old man for a while! Strange world.<br />This should be an easy purchase choice for most Bowie fans.<br />Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|3.0|ok so I LOVE minecraft and I was going to get it... but when I looked at the price? I thought &quot; whoa! that is way to priced... maybe I am better off with minecraft only on the computer. &quot; If you have minecraft on the computer... your good.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Downloaded and Installed without any problems. User Interface is easy and was able to browse my phone and find files
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As I finished it I just could't believe that the end was that way, it felt strange, almost disappinting. But after a few hours of reflexion I could really appreciate the sweet realism and the true lesson of this final book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is super addicting once u get the hang of it... I recommend u just let ur dragons sit for a while and collect the money they make every couple of hours... great game for the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I started reading the first book I couldn't stop until fish all three books. And this sequel was a good one. Not as good as the first book, but just as captivating.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire.  I find it hard to navigate, and as a result I access my Yahoo mail from the internet as I did before getting the app.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I had hoped that this was a Maj Jong Game but it is a matching game of Maj Jong tiles. Having said that, I have spent a few hours enjoying the various games. Enjoyable and relaxing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Maybe I am missing something, but this book just didn't match the hype. Yes, it was thought provoking in regard to whether or not we ever REALLY know our spouse/significant others. The other relationships just are not developed enough. Amy isn't as much amazing as conniving and messed up. It is not a must read as far as I am concerned and my book club agreed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am on level 221 and have 24,458 coins. I have completed all of the puzzles and I still keep playing. What am I doing?  Wish I could sell the coins. I have enjoyed this app immensely.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|Heard a lot about this show and I was not disappointed.  A must see for all horror fans. I am hooked and I am now an avid watcher.
006052779X|5.0|I ordered Charlotte's Web for my son for school, and for being labeled as a used book, it was in pretty good condition.  It's something I know my kids will be able to enjoy for a long time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed all 5 books.  Stayed up way too late many <br />nights to  follow the story & characters.    Very engaging <br />plot.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I rented this to watch on the plane to Chicago.  It was well worth the $3.99 or whatever!  I'm considering buying it!
B004V5A7K8|3.0|This game has pretty decent graphics. The backgrounds are shaded to look 3D and the blocks that you hit are partially see-through and very colorfull.  Some blocks have items inside that give you bonus points or lots of extra balls to play with all at once, you just have to catch them.<br /><br />The slider works by sliding your finger across the bottom of your  screen instead of pressing arrow buttons or anything like that (if you've ever pl<br />ayed any older versions of this game, you'd understand why I mention this.)<br /><br />You can't save your progress, which is frustrating if you're used to playing games a little bit at a time.  You also cannot select a level to replay from the menu.  There does seem to be an option to continue your progress but it doesn't work.  I made it to level ten, paused my game, switched apps, and then when I came back to continue my game it took me back to level 1.
B00170GXWG|5.0|Actors played the characters rather than themselves like Tom Hanks and Jim Carrey do.  Plot was good.  Ending kept the main character in his unique role.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in 1 day because I couldn't put it down!  Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|When I first got my nexus 7 a few months ago, this is one game I was looking for. A nice simple breakout game with no unnecessary permissions. I have tried a couple others and gave them the boot for different reasons, but I will keep and play this one.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|This album is just outstanding. I was not the biggest Anthrax fan, but this was my favorite album of 2011. If you like good thrash metal, you cannot go wrong with this one.
145162607X|3.0|I have most of Philippa's books, and enjoy them all, they are easy to read, gripping and always entertaining, even if you know the true historical event, she is usually accurate.It's difficult to put down, so buy and enjoy.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an eye-opening account of a US Navy Seal Sniper in Iraq.<br /><br />It brings the day-to-day life of Chris Kyle to the rest of us, safe at home in our easy chairs.<br /><br />This details the frightening, sometimes funny and always deadly events that occur in our current wars on terror.<br /><br />If this review doesn't tell you what you need to know about this book, buy it and find out for yourself what our men (and women) are facing every day in the Middle-East. The point of view of Kyle's Wife is what brought this story home for me. We so often think that the war is about the men and women who are there. We forget that for everyone there, there is a family at home who dreads getting \\"The Call\\" in the middle of the night from the Department of Defense. Chilling.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Very easy to load and watch via roku, really enjoyed the quality of the replay and ability to start and stop. Of course the movie itself is timeless and a classic.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I found the first half of the book to be really interesting and inspirational. It gives you a great perspective on what it takes to become successful. The second half felt a bit rushed and not as interesting. I also wish that he expanded a little bit more on the last chapter. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who what's to learn a bit more about Arnold's life and his success principles.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book so much! Can't wait for the next one! What's it called? Oh yeah ... The House of Hades. CAN'T. wait.
B004PEJ1H0|1.0|I don't know what exactly was going through his head in deciding to do this cover, but it's HORRIBLE. Why in the world.. with a voice like GM's would he want to ruin the sound that is his trademark for auto tune no less? It's crap. I love the White Light single. Stick with that one. It only has about 10 seconds of auto tuning. Sorry George, but this is a major fail. You're better than this..
B006P0FD4W|4.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" uses the same conceit of the two earlier installments but is actually a prequel, establishing the creepy background for Katie (Katie Featherson) and her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden). Through the power of found tapes, the film takes us back before the first two installments to flesh out what the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" series established - the girls were not random victims of a haunting.<br /><br />Oren Peli's ghost series is known for having certain elements that few other films can replicate: threatening children; subtle but creepy special effects, and using everyday footage to tell a ghost story.  All those elements are in full force in \\"Paranormal Activity 3.\\" The two girls serve as perpetual foils for Kristi's imaginary friend, Toby.  Toby, it seems, is not as imaginary as the girls' mother Julie (Lauren Bittner, adding some skin to the franchise) might hope.  Hapless boyfriend and wedding videographer Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) is particularly interested in what goes on at their house when a specter appears on a homemade film. Dennis' curiosity piqued, he recruits techie friend Randy (Dustin Ingram) to get to the bottom of what's going on by setting up cameras around the house, including one mounted on an oscillating fan.<br /><br />What ensues is a series of freak-outs that range from noises in a closet to something as mundane as a kid wearing a sheet.  The scariest moments involve outsiders like Randy and babysitter Lisa (Johanna Brady). Their reactions add some spice to an otherwise faithful retread of the original film, with Dennis taking the role of the hapless investigator and Julie the unbelieving skeptic. But it's really the girls that make the film so unsettling by talking to the invisible Toby, walking around the house at night, and standing still for hours at a time.<br /><br />\\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" makes clever use of sound, or lack thereof, so that you will be leaning into the screen when the scares arrive.  This installment does resort to more \\"jump\\" scares than the previous two, but that's forgivable given that there are many genuinely frightening moments.  The oscillating camera trick manages to create more dread in a single scene than some horror movie franchises.<br /><br />If \\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" has a weakness it's the ending, less ghost story and more \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\"  Given that the franchise has gotten far more mileage out of the traditional ghost story since \\"Poltergeist,\\" it was probably inevitable.installment does resort to more \\"jump\\" scares than the previous two, but that's forgivable given that there are many genuinely frightening moments.

B000024QML|1.0|I despise people who review a CD/DVD in every detail.  Maybe how the sun was shinng on the day it was recorded.<br /><br />I'm going to be succint and to the POINT.... The CD just SUCKS thens SUCKs again<br /><br />The last selection \\"Go West is supposed to be 8 minutes long and I think it runs just a little over<br />3 mins.  I refused to let this CD even take up space on my shelf and so off to the garage to put it into the garbage.<br /><br />and that my review
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son is a doctor who fan and really likes this product. The toy was well made and went well with his doctor who costume.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy read.  Highly recommend.  Saw the movie and still enjoyed reading the book.  (Six more words required, just six more)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|cool app very customizeable very reliable and fun. Easy to learn and lost of settings. works great on kindle fire.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love city story so so much it kicks @ss!I haven't played this yet but club story city story and zoo story rock so........can't wait!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book is hands down one of the most creative works of literature I have ever read. Everyone needs to read it at least once.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so intriguing that I couldnt put it down.. read it in 2 days.<br />I am an avid \\"romance novel\\" reader but this book took the cake.  Wow.<br />Drawback:  DONT leave this around the house where young people can pick it<br />up and read it.  It will give them a distorted view of 'things'.  As I said..<br />fascinating.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Like many of us, I attempt to use every spare moment \\"reading\\" and have found audio a delight when I'm moving about. The story is amazing...I'm sure it is not only because of the twist and turns of the plot, but also the personal reflection it brought about in my own relationship with my own sister. How wonderful to be as close as the sisters in the book are! I would not allow the audio to be any reason to subtract star points, however, the British accent - necessary - left me feeling somewhat confused as to who was speaking and when the locale changed. Trying to keep up with that (which I've never experienced in an audio before) took away time that I should have been deep into the details! Do what we do best - pick it up, hold it, read it!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Goin' Nuts! is very entertaining! With never ending goals, so it never gets boring. I highly recommend this game, I love it.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It was great and well written. I can't believe some of these events were real. It was a very enjoyable book.
B0098460O4|5.0|Considering the age of these two singers and the way that they were discovered you have to shake your head when you listen to this beautiful CD. And it is beautiful !! I can't stop listening to it and would recommend it to anyone. In fact I will be buying 10 more to give as Christmas gifts. Can't wait for the next CD and the tour dates in the US. Jonathan and Charlotte you are awesome :)
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great addictive game. I play with my grandson and he loves it! It has vivid colors and animation. The ability to breed various dragons is pretty cool. The time it takes to grow food for the dragons seems a bit long. The amount of coins it takes to clear trees and rocks it also very costly, but I guess it's that way with most of these games. New dragon eggs are extremely exspensive. Overall I give it a 4.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I know the critics were disappointed with the movie, but my son and I just loved it.  There was action, mystery, and a love story.  It was great!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I just bought this item, and can't even open it to decide I don't want it. Now, I just hope I can get my money back.
B008476HBM|5.0|Ok, so the language can be a little rough at times, but reading this book on my kindle was easier because I can look up the definitions without losing the flow of the book.  I'm on my fourth read of this book and it gets better each time. A must read classic!
0316228532|5.0|Brilliant. Literary Genuis. Must read. I couldn't put it down. Give it to your republican/bible thumping relatives at their beloved Christmas.<br /><br />A. They will not read it. Everyone knows the Harry Potter series was devil worship.<br />B. They will rate it 1 star and talk at great lengths about your liberal education and lack of real world understanding.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0055NBYOI|3.0|This mouse has most of the pluses coming using the Steelseries Xai mouse. I am especially interested because this Steelseries mouse retains the soft rubberized coating around the mouse but with a better/smoother scroll wheel compared to Xai, which is what I was looking for. It's just less \\"clunky.\\"<br /><br />The pluses that are inherited from Xai:<br />- very smooth tracking and precise movement<br />- 4 side buttons that are customizable, including macros (using driver software)<br />- Can be comfortably used for both claw/palm grip<br />- Has rubber coating that feels very nice and comfortable to the touch<br />- Good quality teflon feet for gliding<br /><br />THE major flaw that made me return this mouse has to be the sound of the mouse click. It is WAY too loud, especially comparing with Xai. So if you are someone who needs to use it in a quiet room, or is sensitive to noise... stay away. It is just too bad...<br /><br />Also this mouse does NOT have on-board memory so the Steelseries Engine software has to be running and configured on each computer you want to use the mouse with.<br /><br />Note: if your mouse is stuck on \\"red\\" with an LCD, you can run the \\"SSEfix.exe\\" executable inside the Steelseries Engine directory to try to fix the firmware on the mouse.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that this app was free and keeps track of equations as you go along. This app does what I need clearly and with ease. I wish I had had this app months ago.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is okay. It gives you the first ten games. After you complete those games you are suppose to unlock more games. However when I completed the first ten games none of the other games opened.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the only game I've done a review for. It's WAY addicting and super fun. Runs circles around Temple Run. If you like good games, you're gonna love this one.
B008RYN44U|3.0|I enjoyed listening to the new CD but there really wasn't any song that struck me as being that SPECIAL TUNE that you want to listen to over & over again. It's a good effort but I thinks it's just been too long and there doesn't seem to be any need for the band to reunite. The past was awesome but everything on this CD could have just as well been released as the next Gwen S CD for 2012. Evanessence was like this too. The magic just didn't happen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave it 5 stars..Catching Fire is as exciting and explosive as the first book! I can't wait for the movie :)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was loving this game but with the latest update I cant connect to friends towns or send gifts. I hope to see a fix soon before I end up uninstalling
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Very worth it and Taylor is amazing and worth the 5 dollars you're going to spend on her album as well as her other works.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome! Took me about a week to read and when I picked it up, it was hard to put down!! I TOTALLY recommend this book!
0399157565|4.0|This book centers around Kay, the people (and now pets) she loves, the work that drives her, and her cooking. She's still whip smart but she's dealing with an untidy personal life -- neither she nor Benton are settling comfortably into middle age. The ugly episode with Marino becomes unfortunately relevant again. Lucy, for once, is not saddled with operatic problems, and that's a relief. Best of all, the case(s) are fascinating and compelling.<br /><br />Remember the books Scarpetta and The Scarpetta Factor? They centered around Kay's time in New York. But now, with this book, the \\"Gotham Gotcha\\"gossip and the TV fame that marked Kay's time in New York are gone and forgotten. HOORAY! There's a courtroom scene in which Scarpetta's credentials as an expert witness are established/challenged and while all of her education and every moment she spent in the military are mentioned, her time as a TV celebrity is ignored. I think this means Cornwell realizes that was a detour Scarpetta should not have taken.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|It's cheesy at times but overall a good musical with funny lines and great 80s songs. Sometimes the story line was a little rushed.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love the ebay app. I use it all the time. I can keep track of my auctions when I'm on the go and can keep in touch with my buyers or seller at a moments notice! Wouldn't be without it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down.  I am not much of a reader however this book kept me interested the whole time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app so much..it is definitely my most used app on my Kindle Fire! It is very user friendly and the Pinterest format shows up great on the screen. Re-pinning is super ease and you can still browse by categories. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves Pinterest!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The fantasy of Christian Grey is a fun one.  For an academic type person however,  this book falls seriously short.  The redundancy in the writing caused me to lose my interest in this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow its addictive I cant stop playing!! Get this app its awesome! I love it so much I hope you do too!
1439152802|5.0|An excellent novel. If you liked her other books you should like this.  Those that do not like the Forgotten Garden would probably not like this one.  I waited two years for her to write and publish it.  Now probably another two years to the next one.  She weaves a story of many years with lots of flash backs and a really surprising ending every time.
B000S54P4O|4.0|I hesitated to purchase this mp3 as it was older - 2003 - but it has all of the songs their known for and is truly  Calexico at their best.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock is great, offering the math option before you hit snooze is great waking your brain up, it makes it a lot easier for me to wake up
1843106698|5.0|This book takes an in depth look at Aspergers Syndrome (AS) and unpacks an amazing array of strategies that parents, teachers, educators and specialists who work and live with people on the spectrum can use and teach.  Just brilliant!  But not a start out book.  This would be a later read after having come to terms with a diagnosis of AS.
B000FC11A6|3.0|The good: epic, erudite, geeky, engrossing, good character development. I read it as an ebook so I did not have to carry a brick-sized tome of a book everywhere.<br /><br />The bad: just as I was getting wrapped into an interesting chapter, the story went off on a boring tangent, I did not need to know the obscure details of mathematical concepts and although I have studied Perl, I also didn't need to see the ALL the lines of code to understand that encrypting and decoding messages is long and tedious. I ended up skipping pages and pages of minute detail that did not add -anything other than illustrating the concept of tediousnesss- to the story<br /><br />The ugly: I spend hours and hours reading this sprawling book and becoming very involved in the stories of some of the characters just so I could get to a rather underwhelming conclusion, I should have stopped reading 2 chapters before I got to the end!
B00846REIS|4.0|Great plot. Characters held mysterious histories that you need to read to understand the ending. Can't wait for book 3.
B008J34466|2.0|I love Pinks voice and her top two songs on the radio right now...\\"Blow me (one last kiss\\" and \\"Try\\". I knew that there would be a for letter (sh**)cuss word in the song but it wasnt that big of a deal....BUT so many of her songs have four letter F words and saying Slut a lot. I wish I could return the cd but I know it is not allowed after you open it. Still love her voice on the cd but I can not play this CD in the mini van with the kiddos for sure!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I Gave the movie 5 stars. It was sad and happy.I didn't like the ending, but it was an awesome movie .
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax is a super cute movie. The animation is vibrant and draws you in. The story line works for all ages. It a is movie with a message, but if the viewer is too young to pick up on it, he/she will still enjoy the surface humor and the quick moving animation.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was an aw some book but it needs one more book to finish it all off thank you Stephenie Meyer
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read. Rick Riordan is my favorite author. Can't wait to read the next one!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Being a Sherlock Holmes fan and having seen all it's different re-incarnations in movie and TV forms (including the now ridiculous Americanized version), nothing beats the written word of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  I had read the books many years ago and am enjoying re-reading them again.  Only this time, as I read the books, in my mind's eye, I take a little of each actor's interpretation of Holmes that corresponds to Doyle's descriptions of Holmes, which further enhances my reading. While Basil Rathbone brings Doyle's Holmes character and look to life, Watson is not the buffoon depicted in the movies, but an intelligent ex-military surgeon with a thriving practice and a wife.  I have seen every version of The Hound of the Baskervilles any yet they do not match the hair raising descriptions of Doyle!  Doyle brings to life the London of the late 1800's with such clarity as to make you feel that you are there, bringing life to a character that never really existed.  If you are a true reader of books and enjoy terror, mystery and sleuthing, then 'The Complete Sherlock Holmes' is for you.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Really enjoyable movie.  Putting aside all the inconsistencies with the character histories and development, this movie is a lot of fun.  It has good pacing with the adventure scenes moving at a frenetic pace and the set-up scenes providing for some good drama.  The CG Hulk is still too weird and unreal looking but the other effects are well done.  The 3D is mostly used well.
0385535139|4.0|I've always been a John Grisham fan (that has been a tough task lately) and once again he is back to telling a story in the fashion that we have come to expect.  The characters are interesting and likeable.  While they lack real depth, it does not stop the reader from having empathy for each of their situations.<br /><br />The opening chapter grabs you and the feelings of helplessness and anxiety can be felt through the pages as our protagonist, David Zinc, struggles to go to his law firm in the sky one morning.  The rest of that eventful day is a little whacky but it allows Zinc to enter into the world of \\"street law\\" with Finley and Figg.  And street law is where Grisham excels in winding up a story.<br /><br />His new partners, Wally Figg and Oscar Finley, are characters unto themselves and add that touch of realism, balance and humor to the story.  Ambulance chasers and divorce experts (as advertised for $399 on the back of a bingo card) barely make a living until Wally decides that mass tort law against a huge drug manufacturer is the way to nirvana.  Against all guidance by Oscar, the senior partner, Wally is pedal to the metal in promising anything and everything to prospective clients either taking  the cholesterol miracle drug or that have lost a loved one that did.  The big name tort lawyers are proclaiming that the drug is killing people via heart attacks and strokes.<br /><br />Grisham hits a double or triple with this story.  It flew by and I could not wait to read the next chapter.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|The movie itself is what it is.  It is a rehashing of the evils of big business raping the planet combined with a retelling of the western expansion of the US and the treatment of the Indian tribes.  Within that context is a really interesting story with lots of fun and excitement.  The visual presentation is at times stunning.  Which leads me to my only real negative which is the 3D.  I had expected it to be a little more stunning and there were scenes where it was used effectly and others where it just wasn't.  Frankly, for a movie that was made to be seen in 3D I expected more.  Especially the floating mountains.
1451696205|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loved the book (He read the kindle version) and we both loved the movie.  I wanted him to have a hard cover version of the book he loves so much.  This item shipped quickly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|at first I thought it was dumb then I tried it out and I loved it I recomend it for everybody
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait.to read.the rest of the books. This is a brilliant piece. Its better than the movie thats for sure
B008KE3960|2.0|Put your aircraft in circles and just let the game play out, boring. Needs the tanks to fight back. Glad it was free, how about some real games folk. We need something more that a two minute grab while we wait for our trains.
1594135851|5.0|I thought this series would be too \\"young\\" for me, more for teenagers, but after seeing the movie before reading the books the concept seemed interesting to a sci-fi person like me and allowed me to put a face to the people in the books.  Sometimes I got tired of Katniss and her what seemed to me as continual whining about every single thing, but overall I loved the entire series.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|It has been a very long time since a show i watched actually gave me goosebumps. Halo 4 Forward Unto Dawn is a instant masterpiece. With a game like halo being put into a movie format you worry if its just going to turn into a Michael Bay explosion fest. Which there is nothing wrong with that but it's over done. It was a pleasant surprise to see it not be focused the whole time on Master Chief. To anyone a fan of the series of Halo it is a must. If you never cared for the Halo games you need to step aside and still watch this movie because it's what needs to be done with all movies. This same high level of quality the only complaint that i had about it was sometimes too much slowmo segments. Glad to see they used the same voice actor from the original Halo games. So if you have not watched it on Youtube yet why you still reading this? Go watch them. I will wait for your return............................................................... AWESOME RIGHT!? Totally amazing! Now Pre-order it go on. Go ahead no one is judging you for liking a Halo movie. There you go good job. High Five!

B0030Y11XS|1.0|As someone who has mildly enjoyed several of Mr. Moore's films in the last several years, particularly Fahrenheit 911, I was heartily disappointed by his failure to deliver when it came to \\"Capitalism: A Love Story.\\" Given that there was so much potential for a serious, methodical, coherent documentary on all of the flaws of laissez-faire American capitalism as it has been practiced over the last thirty years, I was stunned that his overall product could be so childish and banal.<br /><br />Mr. Moore opens and closes the film with scenes of a family in rural America being evicted from their home. According to the narration the home has been in the family for several generations. Why these people are being evicted, he does not say. We do not know if it failure to pay a mortgage (probably not, if it is a family property); failure to pay property taxes; or other indebtedness on the part of the homeowners. From the looks of them, they do not appear to be the most financially responsible people in the world. Mr. Moore would have us believe that whatever the reason these people are losing their home, it should somehow be perceived as a black mark against capitalism itself. He neglects to mention that millions of Americans buy homes and live in them for years or even decades while being financially responsible and no one ever shows up to repossess the property in question.<br /><br />Mr. Moore goes on to address the frenzied building boom in Florida during the housing bubble, and the subsequent emergence of the 'vulture condo' industry where enterprising (and somewhat unscrupulous) investors purchase foreclosed properties at deep discounts to their original price, usually at the expense of the owner being forced into the sale. While the housing bubble of 2000-2007 will no doubt be remembered as one of the worst excesses in US financial history, the presence of thousands of blighted homes on the coast of Florida can hardly be considered the worst feature of modern capitalism. As the very presence of so called 'vulture capitalists' would imply, the current expectation is that eventually the housing market will recover and new buyers will scoop up these properties. Otherwise they would be owned by the bank at this point and not new, private investors. We might sympathize with the people who originally lost their homes (or investments, as they might be) but it is not like they would be the first people to go down in history as overzealous speculators who lost their shirts at the height of a financial bubble.<br /><br />Mr. Moore also chooses to attack the private prison industry, which admittedly is one of the more horrifying features of America's prison-industrial complex and the privatization of state services in general, but not on general principle, but because a corrupt judge was receiving kickbacks from a private corrections company to whose facility he was sentencing juvenile delinquents. One corrupt judge invalidates the legitimacy of American capitalism? Give me a break. Then he goes on to denigrate the airline industry for paying low salaries to entry level pilots. As a pilot myself, I know just how little airline pilots at most airlines are paid. And yet the airlines continue to be inundated with applications whenever a hiring window opens up! Did Mr. Moore ever hear about supply and demand? Does he not know that when a plethora of people, for whatever reason, supply their labor to a given industry far in excess of what is demanded, that the price of their labor will fall? Are we supposed to excoriate the capitalist system over this immutable fact?<br /><br />Mr. Moore's treatment of Wall Street is equally pedestrian and sophomoric. For anyone who actually wants to see a good documentary about the corruption inherent on Wall Street, and in particular the links between financiers and our lawmakers in Washington, check out \\"Inside Job\\" by Charles Ferguson. Whereas Mr. Moore had the opportunity to examine the deep wrongdoing of Wall Street in this film, he instead bores us to tears with theatrics showing him trying to force his way into the Goldman Sachs headquarters. When trying to expose the (unnecessary) complexity of the derivatives trade, he tries to prove his point by interviewing a succession of financial 'experts' who cannot explain in plain English what a derivative is. Anyone who wants to know what a derivative contract is can look it up on Wikipedia; if Mr. Moore is trying to make a point by interviewing a number of twerps who lack the acumen to successfully explain it themselves, he is making a hollow point.<br /><br />About the only redeeming feature of this film is his commentary that a) during the last thirty years our best young minds have in fact gravitated towards Wall Street and not towards careers in science, engineering, medicine, education, the arts, or public service - although this point has already been made ad nauseam by plenty of other opinion makers; and b) bailout money made available to the major banks was hoarded instead of being put back into the economy, a point he makes by highlighting the plight of a Chicago window manufacturer that is shut down for lack of access to bank funds even though it's principal creditor, Bank of America, has just received a major TARP loan.<br /><br />Altogether a very weak documentary, in fact I will take the gloves off and say that it is a total waste of time and money. Shame on Mr. Moore - this piece could have been so much better but it looks like he is finally succumbing to his own hubris.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I finally downloaded this app for my kindle fire after getting sick of being bombarded by mail.yahoo.com to switch from the mobile website to the app. After a lengthy download, I can't even get the app to open, it just immediately force closes. I'll stick to the mobile website, thanks, and would reccommend that nobody else waste their time on this app.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones has done it again. If you like her bluesy singing you will enjoy this album. I have listened to it over and over.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|recommend for any one who likes puzzle type games it is great. I like that it is not super easy or to hard. great for a break from life once in a while.
0920236251|5.0|I've been reading Robert Munsch books for 20 years. I have read them to neices, nephews, kids I've mentored, neighbor kids, kids at church, airports, & doctors offices and any place you find a kid. Kids love them as they have a great story, good rhythm and they are funny. \\"The Paper Bag Princess\\" is about a young girl who lives a very backward Cinderella type story. she is not about to let her prince get by with his bad attitude with her. \\"Annikins\\" are approx 3 1/2\\" x 3 1/2\\" so they fit in a birthday card or in your purse. You can also buy the books in 8\\" x 8\\" glossey cardboard cover or in hardback. In my opinion, any Robert Munsch books are the best. He has around 30+ titles.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I decided to finally read this after being the only one of my friends who hadn't.  The writing was very poor.  The author repeated phrases throughout the story.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|A great read!  I could not wait to finish the book!!  Kay Scarpetta is a character that just keeps evolving - never the same, certainly not predictable!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book.  I loved the character development and didn't want the story to end.  The book was well written and very engaging
B001B9BEF4|5.0|Elephant is terrific.  Jack's vocal delivery is unapologetic (as usual).  A must for any white stripes fan as well as those who just enjoy rockin' out.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book had more of a story than the first but the writing was very amateurish.  The story did begin to evolve, but too much repetition.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I grew up on the original Oregon Settler and I have to say that I'm loving this version just as much as the original.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther is another example of DeMille's writing through the sardonic style of his main character John Corey.  The story line is fast paced and topical.  A great read.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I was disappointed.  IMO, the script and the casting were weak at best.  The storyline presented an opportunity, but Ridley Scott just didn't make the leap.  I actually watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss something.  I didn't. Special Effects were good, but not great.  This movie didn't come close to the the first two - \\"Alien\\" & \\"Aliens\\".  I think if you are a follower of Mr. Scott's earlier movies you'll likely be very disappointed. If I could give it 2.5 stars I would. I wouldn't recommend it - I rather watch \\"Aliens\\" again for the 20th time.
B005COO1X6|3.0|In a nutshell, this a classic Stephen King short story with many familiar feeling characters and demons. While a bit gory, it is a somewhat tamer than some of his other stuff and might be a good introduction to SK to a younger reader.<br /><br />Although predictable, I did find this novella very entertaining and I'm sure it will find it's way to the big-screen in some form. It is a good value as a Kindle Single
B008RZF2I0|5.0|OK... This Album is just Awesome!!... Music is like always Great!!... Vocals are Perfect Knowing that Khan is not here anymore... And I think Youngblood made a great effort on guitar... I think its the best album in that regard... Well... Music is Great here and you will love it!!! (I like ALL of their albums because they are all different and this one is not the exception)... But now Limited Edition is Real Special!!!... Its not like those \\"Special Editions\\" just because they have a bonus CD... This one is just Pure Quality!!!!... From the Box to the 44 page StoryBook... To the Ecolbook CD... Bonus CD... Everything is just Awesome... Belive me... If they choose to re-release every album in this Limited Edition Format... I will buy them all Again!!!... (I have all of them already)... Excelent Job on this one Kamelot!!!... Five Stars... ;)
B002ZG9968|2.0|This film seems to have all the right ingredients, but somehow they totally fail to gel. The storytelling is uneven, J-Lo is miscast, and overall I struggled to actually care enough about the characters. It's only an hour and three quarters long, but watching it felt like a chore. I didn't even properly watch it to the end, because it was obvious what was going to happen and I just didn't care enough to stick around for the details.<br /><br />Glad I only rented it.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|My son saw this before me and said it was funny. I watched it and it was. It's one of those dumb but way funny movies. Lol
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Great price . Works great! This product works well with my iPad and I have seen no problems arise .
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was hard to put down once I started.  It is a little disjointed at times, but when you consider how long he has been working on it and how he used notes and bits of paper to recall his memories, it is understandable.<br />I read that Pete worried about how some of the people mentioned might react to what he disclosed, but for the most part, I think he had good things to say.  I especially like the renewed love between Pete and Roger.<br />The only problem is that over the years, Pete's opinion seems to change.  One moment he loves everyone, the next moment he is overly critical.  I hope he is truly happy at this time in his life.<br />It was nice to get to know more about his past and his family.  It's too bad he couldn't appreciate his ex-wife Karen more.  She seems like she was about as understanding as she could possibly be.<br />It's also too bad Pete had to struggle for so long with his feelings and couldn't truly enjoy what he was doing as an artist.  He is incredibly talented.<br />Unlike some memoirs that tend to concentrate on only one aspect of the artist, I feel like Pete truly let us get to know him more on a more intimate level.  He did not seem to hold back on much and was willing to not only take credit, but to take blame when required.  It's pretty brave for someone who is easily idolized.<br />I am a huge fan of both The Who and of Pete's solo work.  Let My Love Open the Door is my all time favorite song.  I feel Quadrophenia is the greatest album of all time.  It is the ultimate Who album with each member at their best.  I also am thankful for Pete's Chinese Eyes album that I listened to on an almost daily basis during high school.  I could start off in a bad mood and end up happy by the end of the record.<br />I look forward to seeing the Who in concert again this month.
076781326X|2.0|I always loved the movie Oliver. I was hoping to introduce this to my grandchildren<br />What I received was a plastic box- no paperwork inside- no programs- just a box and unmarked disc of the dvd- no artwork on the dvd- looks like  copy of something-I was so disappointed- we couldnt find out tracks, who performed, no info at all inside the box- unlike any other dvd I ever ordered from Amazon.
B009KKLQVS|1.0|I haven't heard it so I am reviewing the DVD for content, or in this case missing content. You could put all the songs in the show on one DVD and make everyone happy. But NOOOOOOOOO, you put less than half for the faithful fans that have followed you for 50 years. Even  back in 1966  the band put filler on the albums as Brian was been asked to put  album after album out with hardly a break. It's 2012 and now someone has decided that half a concert will make the fan's happy ?Another person said it looked like Love picked all the song's. It certainly looks that way. But it's not just  him , it's some dweeb in marketing, should be sacked. I'm not buying it  as its a rip off  for the band and fans ! I guess I'll wait for the extended cut.  You'd think that house in Tahoe would be paid off by now and you'd thank the fans who stood by them through all the years. this will be the first Beach Boy item that won't see my support, sadly. But I can't get into greed when a Blue ray would have done the whole show plus extra's :(
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story was intriguing and, as a parent, I was gripped by the main character's battle to remain loyal and hopeful in the face of mounting evidence of guilt. The concept of nature vs. nurture and parental responsibility for our children's actions was fascinating. I couldn't put this book down.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Time for another Rod Stewart comeback!  #1 on Amazon!  Move over Susan Boyle and Josh Groban (who struck Platinum in previous years)!  First it was The Great American Songbook, than last time out Soulbook (Rod singing soul classics).  NOW, it's Christmastime, time to hear gravel voiced Rod cheer up the season and give us a new classic Christmas album!  And many duets to even enhance this collection even more!  You cannot go without buying this album.  Any fans of Christmas music and good ol Rod Stewart fans MUST get this one!  ;)
B008N1V11U|3.0|is it just me or is it that when ever I play the last mission in chapther 2 it freezes and crashed?

1607066017|5.0|We meet Marko and Alana the day their daughter is born. In the back of an old body shop, on a star called Cleave, little Hazel is born to parents who were once on opposite sides of an ages old war. Now, with the birth of their hybrid daughter, Marko and Alana's old armies have even more reason to find the new family and end them. . .<br /><br />Marko is from planet Wreath. He was a prisoner and Alana his guard; she was from planet Landfall. Both of them decided their love was more important than continuing to fight in a war that neither planet can remember the origins of.<br /><br />But now Hazel has been born, and there is a buzz in the Landfall Capital. Prince Robot IV is being taken out of his peaceful reprieve and sent to hunt down Marko and Alana - making sure to end them before word gets out to either side of their AWOL treachery in the name of enemy `love'. Meanwhile, Wreath's people have hired freelance assassins to kill the dissenting parents, and return with baby Hazel alive. On the case are two of the galaxy's most successful assassins - The Will, along with his trusty Lying Cat. Then there's The Stalk - who never misses her target.<br /><br />`Saga' Volume One is the first graphic novel instalment in a new intergalactic series, with story by Brian K. Vaughn and art by Fiona Staples.<br /><br />I am a fan of graphic novels - but I admit, I've been very conservative in my graphic reading habits. I tried to get into the spin-off `Buffy' comic series back in 2007, because it was touted as being Season eight and I was still feeling the `Buffy' void after the show's end. But I just couldn't get into it - Joss Whedon's particular brand of snark works best for me on TV. So then I limited my reading to graphic adaptations of the book series I already loved - Diana Gabaldon's `The Exile' story set in her `Outlander' universe. I love the graphic adaptations of Paricia Briggs's `Mercy Thompson' and Gail Carriger's `Parasol Protectorate' series. I journeyed outside my comfort zone when I read the brilliant children's graphic novel `The Deep: Here Be Dragons' with story by Tom Taylor, and art by James Brouwer. So I was well and truly ready to delve even deeper into the graphic novel world, when a blog I frequent by the name of Jezebel wrote up a glowing piece on this new series called `Saga'. It sounded dark, smart and complex - but it was mention of a (literal) star-crossed lover's story that really hooked me.<br /><br />`Saga' is so, so, so good! I was laughing from the first page - and from the first panel glimpse of Marko, I was swooning. The story begins right in the thick of action - with Alana giving birth to Hazel and soldiers from both Wreath and Landfall breaking in to take the family down - because word of enemy's falling in love and starting a family would be one hell of a bad PR campaign for this war of no end.<br /><br />The series is very clever and makes societal and political commentaries that are reflective and relevant to the modern-day. It's in the things like Landfall royalty, Prince Robot IV, having a television for a head - that, I think, says something about corrupt media's tyrannical hold over society. Then there's the pornographic planet, Sextillion, where hired assassin The Will travels when he's down on his luck hunting the new parents and wants to drown his sorrows in sex. Sextillion is all bright lights, paid flesh and beautiful depravity - but, as The Will soon discovers, it has a sick and seedy underbelly . . .  again, this is no doubt commentary on the sexualisation of our own society - and in a particularly horrendous scene, Vaughan will really have you thinking about the slippery slope of carnal consumerism.<br /><br />I did appreciate how very, very clever `Saga' was - for all that's between the panels, if you will. But what made this graphic novel so brilliant was the story. In particular, I loved our narrator; an older Hazel is recounting the story of her parent's love and her birth from somewhere in the future. She peppers her reminiscence with references to life now. At one point she muses; \\"From my very first day, I was pursued by men. All of them tried to hurt me, but only one managed to break my heart . . . Sorry, getting ahead of myself.\\" I loved that Hazel had a voice in this novel, it means that though she's an adorable (but silent) baby when this story starts, we do get a sense of her personality through her omniscient narration - more than that, her hints about what the future holds makes me very, very hopeful for a long, epic series in which we eventually catch up in the story to follow an older Hazel.<br /><br />`Saga' is very much an adult graphic novel (if the mention of Sextillion wasn't enough of a tip-off). There are graphic sex scenes, and violent deaths. It's also scary as all get out . . . when I turned the page and saw an image of spider-like assassin The Stalk I felt my palms begin to sweat. It's really a testament to Fiona Staple's utterly beautiful, detailed and sometimes creepy artwork. She's amazing - and I think I will have to trawl through her backlist and read absolutely everything she's put her artistic licence to.<br /><br />The fact that `Saga' is so adult is also why I liked it so much - it's complex and far-reaching, set on an epic scale and concerning AWOL lovers, broken-hearted assassins and royal soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder. This is really a series to sink your teeth into.<br /><br />I will also say that `Saga' has a very cinematic quality to it. I have high-hopes that because Brian K. Vaughan has a Hollywood history (he was a writer/producer on TV show `Lost') that there is every chance this brilliant series could be adapted . . . I'm especially elated to discover that Vaughan wrote for the Buffy season 8 comic series, because while reading `Saga' I kept thinking that it had a Joss Whedon quality to it - with hints of `Firefly'. It's in Alana's snarky comments, a tangled back-story between The Will and The Stalk and a clear long-reaching story arc.<br /><br />I love, love, loved `Saga'. I'm now officially addicted. Issue number seven has recently come out, with instalment eight due later in November. I need it - seriously! It has become a delicious drug, delving into this intergalactic love story and I just can't wait to go back. . .ewhere in the future. She peppers her reminiscence with references to life now.

B0000942HV|3.0|The problem with this 2003 version of Tubular Bells is that Mike Oldfield has re-written the entire original album with updated technology that's sort of become generic by this point.  Back in 1973 this stuff was way ahead of its time.  This actually makes the music worse.<br /><br />The music on this 2003 version of Tubular Bells sounds overproduced in a few parts (in particular the heavy guitar rocking ones) and as a result, many of the instruments blend together and the entire performance feels SEVERELY glossed over.  The instrumentation in the original used to REALLY jump out and leave you floored but now these instruments just... appear, rather predictably.  When this version of the album was being made, it's like Mike was saying \\"Alright, time for this part\\" and he lays it down with no concern for making it stand out.  He clearly wanted to toy with todays technology and give fans an updated version of his legendary album.<br /><br />What makes the original Tubular Bells so fantastic is the way several different melodies and instruments are attached together to form a highly detailed and origianl work of art.  Every single musical instrument made an impression in the original version.  You were blown away when, for example, the guitars or piano appeared in a really explosive and bombastic way.  Now, the experience feels restrained and sort of tired.  The only way you can truly appreciate this 2003 version is by never having heard the original.<br /><br />Another aggravating complaint is that my favorite part -the Irish lullaby around 14 minutes in- has been removed and replaced with bland piano that triggers a *significantly* less satisfying response.  Ugh!  To give a compliment, the piano intro famous for its inclusion in the horror classic the Exorcist has been extended and builds up a bit better than the original.  Clearly the *only* thing that's better.  The final 15 minutes is identical to the original with the screaming/muffled voices and howling which further shows how unnecessary this version is.  Pick up the original version of Tubular Bells instead.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This has to one of the most addicting games ever. The down side is there is no easy way to earn coins and I cannot afford to buy them. This could easily become anaddiction if you had the money to start buying coins.<br /><br />The only confusing aspect to this cant is the associated puzzle that partially opens at level 10. There is no associated help or FAQ guide to give the user a clue as to what this puzzle is all about!  PLEASE PROVIDE SOME IMFORMATION ABOUT THE ASSOCIATED PUZZLE OR REMOVE IT. This puzzle component is so frustrating that if I did not enjoy coindozer so much, I might be tempted to uninstall the application. Who knows, if frustration level exceeds fun, I might have to go ahead and uninstall Coindizer!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series as it has all the aspects of Fifty Shades, but a great story.  I rad through Bared to You and paced myself as I knew that Reflected In You would not be out till October. Once this was released, I downloaded it and in 2 days, the book was done. I cannot wait till the 3rd book is out... ugh, in March!!!!  You will absolutley love this series whether you liked Fifty Shades or not.  It has sex, suspense, love, and friendship... Excellent twists and turns.
0062059882|5.0|This is a great book. I would definitely recommend to read it. The author uses an intrinsic plot to keep engaged in the book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|When I first wrote this review two and a half years ago, I summed up the 50 Shades Of Grey trilogy as the BDSM version of Cinderella.  In 50 Shades Freed Cinderella (Anastasia) gets her man (Christian) when they tie the knot and go on an elaborate European cruise.  More sex... apparently every 15 minutes.  More struggles with control.... he won't even let her go on a Jet Ski by herself.  Until he thinks Ana betrays his trust.  Ana gets the chance to save her prince in the end and they live happily ever after in their multi-million dollar mansions.  Like the first two volumes, there were more sizzling sex scenes.  If there is one thing EL does well, it's writing those tantalizing sex scenes.<br /><br />However, looking back in broader context E.L. James through this series has exposed a topic to the world that very few people had ever thought about.  This series ignited a boom in the number of people who are reading again, especially on Kindles and iPads.  It has also created a spark in the bedroom for countless couples.  Since reading this series I have read many series from authors who wouldn't be nearly so successful if it hadn't been for this story.  Erotic series from authors like Silvia Day, J. Kenner, Cherise Sinclair and M.T. Stone ([[ASIN:B00OKILIPY Raven's Seduction]] is my new favorite) have thrived in it's wake.<br /><br />So even though Fifty Shades will never be regarded as a great piece of literary art, no one can deny it's far reaching impact.  If you enjoyed the first two books in this series, you need to read this one as well.  The transformation of Christian becomes complete and they finally achieve their HEA.  Rock on Fifty Shades!  The publishing industry and now the movie industry both owe you a huge debt of gratitude.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I'm not a fan of the sound effects, but the tastefully done third dimension gives a good balance of modernity and nostalgia. Worth the dollar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like the game I found it hard to find diamonds or gold at first but now its awesome if they added buckets and nether portals and more mobs it would be the best version ever
030758836X|1.0|This book is very confusing and I do not recommend it to anyone! It was very dumb and pray I never read a book by this Author again. Please spend you money wiser than I did!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|couldn't put it down till i finished.. i am happy to finally find out wat the cause of Gideons night mares are.. can't wait to find out what happens in the next one now with Eva knowing the reason why Gideon was being distant.
B005FFW46S|4.0|Snuff like all of the Disc World books was an enjoyable read  and not just that, like Men at Work and Thud it tackles the tricky subject of racism and prejudice in a sensitive manner.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until the next book comes out! I reread the first one again I bought the second just so my mind was refreshed. I just love this series.
B0043U98RY|2.0|The CGI blood looks like Kool Aid. Seriously, these are some of the WORST CGI effects I have ever seen. The fights get sort of cool, then, splash - a fountain of blood that actually made me laugh instead of getting thrilled. At least this is one less series for me to buy/follow.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is without question one of those series that you must watch. All of the seasons are equally worth watching.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book, lots of twists and turns! A refreshing change from my (much loved) crime stories.... Looking forward to reading more novels by Gillian Flynn.
B008OOYALE|4.0|i like it its a good game when u have the time to chdck on ur stuff. i also like it for th holiday  dragons
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My boyfriend introduced the Angry birds to  me. I find it funny and very entertaining :)I dont play often, but when I do it is always fun.
B006NXICT4|5.0|Swept along with katniss on her journey,lived every minute as if I was there brilliant author and cried like a baby at the end of the third book.  Thank you Suzanne for a wonderful journey
1423140605|5.0|I bought this Book for my 9 year old daughter, who is addicted to the Rick Riordan books! She was so excited to receive the book she read the whole thing in 2 day's! My husband is also a fan of the series ( thanks to our Daughter) and he also really enjoyed the newest book. They can't wait for the next book to be released!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Filled with too much kinky sex. First book lack much story and dragged in the middle because it was brutal sex constantly. I just skipped a lot of pages. The second and third were better, but the ending was sad too me. He took advantage of a young girl and had his way. She knew nothing different.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I wouldn't recommend it just because its another internet needing app. I don't think you should waste your time... but if your like me... looking at all the bad reviews and still wanting to try it...go ahead.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great book.  Reading the series in order and love them. This one was one of the best so far.  Jack Reacher an American hero.
1451696191|5.0|I read a lot of books... and I mean A LOT of books.  I seriously fell in love with this one just after reading the first couple pages.  It has a great plot, and the way that the story is told is very interesting and catchy.  You will love it whether you're into mystery, romance, or pretty much anything else!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game!!!  I think its the best!  You. can build almost anything.Pig fly everywhere allaround.YOU SHOULD BUY IT.trust me.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is an inspirational toy that invites a child to enter the detailed design of the town hall to play. This creation is a beautiful work of art, which made it a joy to give to my 11, 9, 7 and 5 year old children.
0385535147|1.0|The first 1/2 of this book was really, really good; and the last part was REALLY, REALLY bad, as in boring, flat, unbelieveable and stupid.  You want me to believe that a woman who has visited her brother every week in prison for five years, and then watched him return to a life of crime, would forsake everything that she's worked for and against to help a man commit an inexplicable escapade.........based on having flirted with him via eye contact and a couple of encrypted emails?  You want me to believe that a 30 year old young man who has no history of ever even speaking with a black man, would meet him in a bar and foresake his business and betray his mother, for the thrill on being in a movie?  That a person can get into the first aid kit of a private jet and fill it with cocaine, and the person has never met a cocaine distributor?  That an 40 year old ex-lawyer, who only has $150,000 to last him the rest of his life, would refuse to work; and then spend $23,000 for a car, $3,000 for a mail box, $3,000 for a lawyer to set up a dummy business, $1,000 a day for two phony film crew members, $5,000 a day (twice) to rent a private jet, etc.?  In the middle of this book whatever story could have been developed went downhill faster than a ski slope.<br /><br />Please tell whomever options this book for a movie, because it has a seemingly attractive black lead character, not to invest a dime in the ending of this story.  People will laugh them into bankruptcy.  Have someone write a new ending.
1579128955|5.0|A visually stunning book with concepts that will take me decades to comprehend.  The periodic table in the back of the book is a bonus.  One of those books I might consider to bring with me on that island...
B0033TJATW|5.0|THE DVD DID NOT HAVE AS MUCH COVERAGER AS THE VHS VEFRSION OF MICHAEL JACKSON'S MOON WALKER HOWEVER THE DVD VERSION DID BRING MICHAEL JACKSON BACK TO LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT I WAS EXSPECTING OF THE DVD IF YOU ARE A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN THIS TRUELY IS A MUST HAVE
B004D1CK32|5.0|Before seeing this movie, I was very skeptical about all the 5-star reviews.  I figured this was probably just a decent film w/ a large cult following.  No, I was wrong -- it really was an incredible film!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. If you like temple run then you'll love this game:-) This game is also great since it's around halloween:)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the best \\"finder game\\" ( as my 4yr old calls it). We play it together. It has so many fun puzzles and plenty of ready hints. Good plot background to drive it and the detective role is great! Not too evil or scary. Our favorite mystery game!  Make more like this!!!!! Please!!!
1609611543|5.0|In short... I absolutely recommend this book. It's packed with documentation and not just a bunch of opinion. After only reading part-way into the book I decided to make a very honest attempt to drop gluten from my diet. I and others were astonished with how quickly results were visible.  Within barely two months, I dropped twenty-eight pounds and five inches off my waist. And \\"kicking gluten to the curb\\" was honestly the only change I made to my typical routine. I highly recommend this book as well as...\\"make a change if you're seriously interested in your health.\\"
B004FOA84A|4.0|This hidden object game is fun and not too hard. A good one for kids and it gets very easy after playing it a few times. Still it is nice not to have them exposed to occult images found in some other games. We like the mystery and challenge of puzzles without scary evil things. Make more please!
B009186JYI|3.0|I am ready to buy the  Rolling Stones \\"Charlie is my Darling\\" DVD. I noticed that the description says it's 4:3 (1.33 x 1.0) aspect ratio, but the Blu-ray is listed as 16:9.<br /><br />I found a website for home theatre buffs, and their DVD listing (UPC 038781100893) was 16:9 view.<br />This is confusing, and I hope someone at Amazon can help. I certainly don't want a \\"pan and scan\\" version if the film was originally shot in 16:9.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|I love James McAvoy, he is a great actor, but I could only feel sorry that he had to work with this terrible script for an absurd movie.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I got this for my 5 year old son after I enjoyed the film years ago. It's scary, spooky and funny all in one with fun songs to sing.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Very fun game that works great on my Asus tablet. Colorful graphics and smooth play. I loved the old arcade games so this is right up my alley.

B0098460O4|3.0|As were millions, I was unexpectedly blown out the window with shock, amazement and pure JOY when the shy, fat kid who looked like he had just walked off the street onto the Britain's Got Talent stage first opened his mouth to sing his gift to the world.  Tears and sobbing are involuntary responses for many who hear Jonathan's astounding gift - no matter how many times you replay and savor the overwhelming JOY of his talent once again.<br /><br />I seriously believe that Jonathan may be holding the most perfect and powerful singing gift in human history.  The fact that he is only 17 and sings clearly better than the greatest and most talented tenors on the planet - living or dead - is nothing short of miraculous.  I tear up just writing about Jonathan and what he has given and will give to the world.<br /><br />Regarding the first CD, I must reluctantly echo the reviewers expressing disappointment that Jonathan's mega talent was unfortunately watered down and diluted in the CD production.  Although the CD is very good and even wonderful in places, the BGT videos are way more powerful and exciting.  All Jonathan fans will want to get the CD anyway, but after only a couple of listens, I find myself feeling frustrated when the orchestra is way too loud, and the choir (completely unnecessary and even annoying) is drowning out the main attraction.  The orchestra is too \\"full\\" and loud most of the time on the CD.  The musical accompaniment should have been quite minimal to focus the listener's ears and attention on the main event.<br /><br />Charlotte has a very beautiful, sweet voice and is very pleasant to listen to.  She is very talented.  With the right breaks she could (will probably) have a successful career of her own.  Simon's first impression, however, was spot on.  She would have to be a Sarah Brightman right now to fully complement Jonathan's voice (a tall order even for Sarah Brightman).  Charlotte certainly has the capacity to develop into a Sarah Brightman class singer eventually, but Charlotte's voice right now has a sweet nuance and tenderness of youth.  That's not bad, but somewhat out of sync with Jonathan's amazingly fully mature, how-could-it-be-more-perfect gift.  Their music together is very wonderful anyway, and part of me feels like a jerk for being so precise comparing Jonathan and Charlotte in my review.<br /><br />To be brutally honest (Simon's trademark), Charlotte's greatest contribution (so far) is to be the wonderfully kind and loving catalyst to give Jonathan the confidence and support he needed to walk out on that BGT stage and unleash his immeasurable gift to humanity.  I deeply thank Charlotte for being the \\"wonderful person\\" she is (Jonathan's words).  Jonathan told us that were it not for Charlotte, we would all still be waiting to discover him.<br /><br />So thank you, Charlotte, for being who you are and for bringing us Jonathan.  For that gift alone, you deserve every wonderful success in your life and in your own singing career - with Jonathan and on your own.  And I am sure you will continue to support Jonathan to fully develop and share his gift as time goes on.<br /><br />The next step has to be a production designed and tailored to showcase all that Jonathan has to offer.  A creatively and carefully orchestrated digital concert of Jonathan's talent should be even more impressive than the BGT performances.  We can look forward to his next effort. (Astoundingly it looks like no effort at all when Jonathan sings - not even breaking a sweat.)<br /><br />CONSOLATION PRIZE:  Here is a gift you can give yourself.  Download the BGT videos from YouTube in mp4 format.  (Firefox with YouTubeEnhancer is what I used.)  Burn them to a CD or DVD.  Play them on your big screen TV and sound system.  You will be very pleased if you have only watched the videos on a computer.  You can thank me later.  This is the best way to maximize your Jonathan experience right now - until his next performances are available.
0374214913|5.0|In addition to being beautifully written and keeping me interested and entertained, the hardback cover glows in the dark. Made me smile. Lovely combination. Glowing review in every way.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat is my favorite book ever because it is so simple and yet speaks to me every time I read it. Take life less seriously and see the positive in all situations. I LOVE this book! Second to this book is Wuthering Heights ... not too different in genre (lol) but I wanted to show how great I think this book is. I LOVE IT
1451662432|4.0|Total Recall: My Unbe­liev­ably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzeneg­ger is an auto­bi­og­ra­phy of the famous actor, politi­cian and cham­pion body builder. While the life that Mr. Schwarzeneg­ger has led are indeed aston­ish­ing, this book is more of a polit­i­cal mem­oir and boast­ing of one's achieve­ments than that of a celebrity autobiography.<br /><br />Dis­claimer: I have been a Schwarzeneg­ger fan for decades. Not only of Ahhnold's (because I can call him that) movies, but also of his body­build­ing, self pro­mo­tion, busi­ness acu­men and focus. From some rea­son I find Schwarzenegger's story and pro­fes­sional suc­cess very inspiring.<br /><br />Due Gov­er­nor Schwarzenegger's recent drama of sir­ing a child out of wed­lock this book has got­ten a lot of press cov­er­age. The drama gets a few pages towards the end and it is not the rea­son I read this book. I would have read the book regard­less as I have read pre­vi­ous biogra­phies of Mr. Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />Regard­less of what you think of the man, there is a lot to admire. While I real­ize that behind every auto­bi­og­ra­phy there is a goal, I can usu­ally fig­ure out what it is and this one is no excep­tion. It seemed to me that the author wanted to cement and high­light his polit­i­cal achieve­ments as Gov­er­nor of Cal­i­for­nia.<br />How­ever, this is also an amaz­ing immi­grant story:<br /><br />\\"To think that a scrawny boy from Aus­tria could grow up to become gov­er­nor of the state of Cal­i­for­nia and then stand here in Madi­son Square Gar­den and speak on behalf of the pres­i­dent of the United States - that is an immigrant's dream.\\"<br /><br />Amaz­ing indeed.<br /><br />The first 200 pages or so of Total Recall: My Unbe­liev­ably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzeneg­ger are ded­i­cated to the author's child­hood and body­build­ing career. The author makes a point which he will make over and over in the book - once he sets his mind on some­thing, any­thing, he will achieve it no mat­ter how dif­fi­cult it is. Schwarzeneg­ger does say that you have to know what to focus on (for exam­ple: this 5'6\\"unathletic man would never set his sights on the NBA) but once you decide you, and only you, have com­plete control.<br /><br />Unlike other biogra­phies I read this one has more per­sonal anec­dotes which, for a fan like me, were well worth the price of admis­sion. Sec­tions about behind-the-scenes of favorite movies (to be hon­est, I liked the vast major­ity of Schwarzenegger's movies includ­ing \\"The Last Action Hero\\" even though I thought it was too early to make such a movie mock­ing one­self, it would have been per­fect if it would have been released a few years ago) were a treat to read as well as anec­dotes from the world of bodybuilding.<br /><br />Espe­cially poignant were the chap­ters about the rela­tion­ship between hus­band and wife (no, there is no dirty laun­dry aired), some­thing which I think many peo­ple, espe­cially immi­grants who mar­ried Amer­i­can women, can iden­tify with. While I cer­tainly appre­ci­ate Maria Shriver for her brain and tal­ent, I could not imag­ine being mar­ried to some­one who grew up with ser­vants, with plenty of \\"old money\\" and a fam­ily of famous and infa­mous. I'm sure it was dif­fi­cult for a man who grew up in a house­hold were only neces­si­ties were granted and dis­ci­pline was the order of the day, every day, to find his love with an heiress and vice versa.<br /><br />The last part deals with Schwarzenegger's role as gov­er­nor of Cal­i­for­nia, an inter­est­ing insight into one of the biggest economies in the world in a time of tur­bu­lence both eco­log­i­cal and eco­nom­i­cal. Unfor­tu­nately for Mr. Schwarzeneg­ger as well as other politi­cians, their con­tri­bu­tion and fore­sight could only be mea­sured decades after their term have been over.<br /><br />There are sec­tions in the book which I found ridicu­lous, enter­tain­ing and ridicu­lously enter­tain­ing all together. For exam­ple, the author's boast­ing on how he was (single-handedly it seems) respon­si­ble for, what many regard now as the sym­bol of psy­cho­log­i­cal inad­e­quacy and the bane of every com­muter, the civil­ian Humvee. Only Schwarzeneg­ger could get away with writ­ing \\"I became the proud owner of the world's first civil­ian Humvee\\" and come away clean.<br /><br />Total Recall is by no means a \\"tell all\\" book; adding the world \\"selec­tive\\" might make the title more descrip­tive. The book is more of a 600 page resume of an inim­itable and astound­ing career. There are no self-examinations per-say, very lit­tle dis­cus­sion of all the R-rated behav­ior that has been attrib­uted to him (besides \\"Arnold being Arnold\\") and the sub­ject is always show­ing him­self in the best pos­si­ble light in every sit­u­a­tion. While that is some­thing we'd all like, it does not make an inter­est­ing mem­oir. For a fan of Schwarzeneg­ger like myself, this was a great book, for every­one else or those look­ing for Latin soap opera style drama, you'll need to look elsewhere.r.<br /><br />There are sec­tions in the book which I found ridicu­lous, enter­tain­ing and ridicu­lously enter­tain­ing all together.

B0091XIZO0|5.0|After my first experience with Lang Lang's recordings - his thrilling Liszt album released in 2011 - this time I was tempted to listen to him performing on disc some of the truly jewels in the Chopin treasure (Etudes op.25, some Nocturnes and Waltzes, plus the solo version of the Andante spianato & Grande Polonaise).<br /><br />His fabulous keyboard technique dominates - as in his Liszt accounts - the proceedings. Yet a more refined - in musical terms - approach would have been helped more in imposing this achievement in the memory of the listener. However, there is a seductive freshness in his playing throughout, while a deeply felt empathy surfaces here and there. Lang Lang scatters inspired shadows and lights in his interpretations, absorbing the vivid aromas of the score. He seems to get poetic depths especially in Nocturnes (the marvellous op. posth. one is simply marvellously played). The 12 Studies op.25 are treated as mere exercises with few exceptions. But what fabulous exceptions! For instance, the \\"Winter\\" Etude becomes a hair-raising experience when Lang Lang relishes a wild storm on the keyboard. The Grande Valse Brillante breathes an impressive air of gracious playfulness due to his comprehensive and sparkling approach too.<br /><br />Surprising - and not inspired, in my opinion - the last track featuring a kind of sung version of the main theme of Etude no.3 op.10. It could (maybe even should) miss the selection of pieces included on this album.<br /><br />Released quite simultaneously with Maurizio Pollini's new Chopin recording, this album by Lang Lang falls a little bit secondary. Although I consider it deserves little above 4 stars, I'll give all the 5 ones, simply for its freshness and youthful vision on a demanding Chopin repertory. These are in my opinion utterly equivalent to Pollini's aristocratic refinement in Chopin, balancing the other side of the scales.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|great album, probably better then forst to for me at least but still have to listen to it a little more. and yea its many times better then most of the crap thats on the radio today but still that isn't so hard. the playing is of course great and so is the singing, would have liked at least 1-2 more songs where both Hughes and Bonamassa sing together, their voices sound very good together
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun and cute game! love it! although its you need coins/gold it does start you out with some but you need neighbors for more.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The Micro USB cable works just fine.  I have no issues with it at this time but it may be too soon to tell. My reluctance to write out a happy note is this:<br />I got the Kindle Fire as a gift but I know how much it costs because it's advertised everywhere.  So I wonder why the Fire would be sent with an inferior recharging cable. That's basically what i was told when I formally complained about an item I had for less than 90 days that suddenly stopped charging.  I will not make this a complaint as it is a review but I will be aware in the future and check comments on the things I buy and I recommend the same for everyone.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|This was one of those movies that I had very small expectations for.  I was surprised that it had an interesting story line and some action, but not too much action.  In my opinion, movies with explosions and no story are just plain boring.  I'm looking forward to a sequel to see what happens next.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book.  Did not want to put it down.  Violent and rebellious.  Katniss is poutty and indecisive often, but it is very entertaining and keeps you guessing.
B000002LMK|5.0|1990 gave us Neil Young's 22nd studio offering in \\"Ragged Glory\\".  This is a balls to the wall rockin' album, ranking up there at the time with \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\", Re.ac.tor\\", \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night\\".<br />Great tracks in \\"Country Home\\", \\"White Lines\\", \\"F-----' Up\\", this song could also be my theme song most of the time, just a great rockin' fun tune.  \\"Over And Over\\", the 10 minute trailblazer \\"Love To Burn\\",<br />the flower power rocker \\"Mansion On The Hill\\", \\"Days That Used To Be\\", Crazy Horse goes all out on \\"Love And Only Love\\", the melodic \\"Mother Earth (Natural Anthem)\\" and The Premiers nugget from the 60's,<br />\\"Farmer John\\".  Crazy Horse in top form on this recording, by the way get the new Neil Young \\"Psychedelic Pill\\", it's as good as this one.  Reprise remaster the catalog!

B002R88G5E|4.0|This was our chosen book group read -I admit I may not have chosen it myself but it is brilliant; a real page tuner. It moved me to tears on a couple of occasions however and it certainly is not a light read. Highly recommended.
1451675046|5.0|Richard Dawkins has a way of imaginatively making you believe in Science.  Go figure, and he's a scientist! Even the title, The Magic of Reality, draws one in.  But what I was most struck by, considering he is a scientist, is he doesn't condescend or talk down to the reader, even though he wrote here for non-scientists.  Half-way through I realized this would be a wonderful way to bring the facts of the subject of life on earth - really! to teens.  Teens are the ones who get into discussions in school, church, and elsewhere about life on earth.  Here are absorbable scientific facts and supportable sequences of events they can use to hold up their end of the discussion.

B005K2YXHO|5.0|I've proven via three or four drop tests that this sleeve provides very good protection for my Kindle.  It also serves as a support for the Kindle when I'm reading at a table or desk.  I also use it as a pocket for papers I get from doctor's offices.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed it, everything McFly does amazes me and this book is a must read, found out so much about the band and was so entertaining I finished it within a couple of nights.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|I just really loved this movie. Nostalgic, without being invasive or condescending. I didn't feel like he was \\"ripping off my childhood\\" like some other recent movies. A beautiful cinematic vision & adorable love story. Thanks again, Wes Anderson.

B00008WT5M|4.0|Money Talks is one of my favorite songs.  I love the way it jams and I can have the kids listen to it and they love it.  Need to be careful with other AC/DC songs. Money talks makes a great ringtone  If there were 1 or 2 more songs I liked on this I would give it a 5 star<br /> I bought  3 AC/CD CD's to get the songs I wanted -  Money Talks is the only one I really wanted from this one.  They don't do Amazon individual songs or greatest hits.<br />AC/DC Favorites<br />Money Talks<br />TNT<br />Dirty Deeds<br />Long Way to the Top if you want to Rock and Roll - Love the Bag Pipes!!<br />I'll try to listen to some others later to find some I like.  I don't like the more vulgar songs.
1423140605|4.0|I liked the book very much!!But i can't wait for the House of Hades!! Iliked it better than the lost hero(worst 4 me), and better than the Son of Neptune(i liked it but MoA is better). It is different because there are 4 narrators, i like the plot and everything is exciting! I can't wait for the next book!! You have to read it right NOW!!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|I bought  3 AC/CD CD's to get the songs I wanted - TNT and Long Way To The Top are great They don't do Amazon individual songs or greatest hits but at least I found 2 of my favorites on this one.  The others CDs only had one..<br />AC/DC Favorites<br />Money Talks<br />TNT<br />Dirty Deeds<br />Long Way to the Top if you want to Rock and Roll - Love the Bag Pipes!!<br />I'll try to listen to some others later to find some I like.  I don't like the more vulgar songs.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very nice twist on match three. Very colorful graphics and effects. Nice story line with good objectives.Music does get a little redundant. Fun game!!
1449410243|5.0|I expected a bit lengthier but it should be a good gift for cat loving friends! Love stuff from the oats
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to read the next two!!  Couldn't put this book down!! Just keeps you wanting to read more and more!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am really pleased with my new cable.  The original cable disintegrated leaving flecks of plastic all over my bedroom carpet which stuck to my feet and got stuck in my stockings when I got ready for work.  It was so bad, I only charged my Kindle when I was home and awake so I could be sure the Kindle wasn't going to catch the house on fire. I still needed to worry about getting shocked by the Kindle but fortunately that did not happen.<br /><br />Thanks, SJ Hubbard
B00846REIS|5.0|Wish the book never ended and can't wait for the newest book to be released.  Women if you read 50 shades of grey....this is a next read

B008HK3XKO|5.0|Does what it claims. Good quality. Propping up your Kindle against a pillow while watching in bed is just not the way to go. The Mareware Vibe Standing Case will hold your Kindle Fire HD 7\\" where you need it, and eliminate unnecessary hassle. Well worth the few dollars. You will be satisfied, I believe. Wayne
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app on my kindle it easy to use. I love the useful info I get from the other pins.
159413586X|4.0|This book was a gift for my sister.  I have not read it but she said it was excellent.  I read \\"Hunger Games\\" and enjoyed it immensely.  Hope this third book in the trilogy is as good.
B00884GR0W|2.0|minecraft is way better than block story and it is more popular and cooler. so don't listen to any of these rumors
B00007AJGH|4.0|I remembered Roger Rabbit from years back. I picked it up just to wander back to the silly but clever animation in \\"Roger Rabbit\\". I was also aware of the background situation where General motors bought up most of the trolley lines, in order to force a transition to use their buses. All in all, I laughed again just as the first time I saw it. While not a flick that is looked at every month, it is a nice break in the usual Hollywood dramas. Let yourself enjoy it without letting the plot put you to sleep.
031620157X|5.0|Loved this book! Great job planting little ideas alon the way and tying them up in a not so obvious way at the end!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I purchased my Android so while I was recovering from surgery I would have something to keep me busy. Little did know that I would not feel like this during my early stage of recovery.<br />I found this to be a great Bible study; however my scheduled did not match the guide as it was sent to me and I missed most of the first. I am trying to keep up. I have not found out how to retrieve missed guides or even slow them down.<br />I know that it designed to make you earnest and eager to keep up but if you are sick and get behind there does not seemed to be anyway to recover.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|If you are a fan of ELO or Jeff Lynne solo music then buy this NOW!!  The first song on the cd is 'She' and this beauty will have you hitting the replay button several times.  I had to listen to this song several times before I could move on to the other treasures.  Each song is performed with Jeff on all instruments except the strings, shakers, and tambourine that were played by Marc Mann and Steve Jay. The songs are sung from the heart as you can feel how much these tunes mean to Jeff.  It is a real treat to hear this music, some songs are familiar and some I have never heard before.  Any new music from Jeff Lynne belongs in my collection and I am glad to have this gem!  You will notice on the insert Jeff has a reissue of Armchair Theatre  that has been out of print for years coming out soon.  He is also putting 'Zoom' which was labeled as ELO however it was more of a Jeff Lynne solo album also due soon along with ELO Live that was also Jeff Lynne. Mr. Blue Sky is a remake of some ELO classics given the Jeff Lynne solo treatment which is also very good!!  I hear Jeff is releasing a cd of all new material in 2013 that I am eagerly awaiting!  So if you want a Jeff Lynne fix now of some old classics buy 'Long Wave' it has a very short running time but it is a cd that you will listen to for years to come!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I can't even begin to say how much I liked this book. I buy a lot of indie sci-fi from the Kindle Store, and most of it is poorly edited and utterly bereft of anything remotely approaching a plot. I came across this I don't know how, and figured \\"well, 99 cents, I can't really lose.\\" This is quite possibly my new favorite sci-fi book of all time. It is written in the style of George Alec Effinger's Budayeen books, with an irreverent 1st person style, occasionally dropping in to 3rd person for various scenes. As thick with the info-dump as a Neal Stephenson novel, but without the massive digressions. There's a hero, he overcomes obstacles (to put it mildly), and an exciting finish. Well written, well edited, fast-paced. All in all, if there were like 500 stars to click, I'd click 'em.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil starts out with a little acoustic guitar then 'Drifting Back' fuses into this 27:35 jam that is as good as anything that Neil Young and Crazy Horse have ever done! WOW!!  This is the Neil Young we have been longing for. I love all of Neil Youngs music but I am a sucker for the sounds of Neil and the Horse!! These guys are doing what they do best and that is rocking and jamming big time!  It is great to see all the 5 star reviews for this cd as Neil has received some negative comments on his last few releases.  Hey, if you are Neil Young you can release any material you desire because he always was one to experiment with different styles of music! So if you want to keep on rocking in the free world then give Neil Young and Crazy Horse a spin.  A double cd, 85 minutes of all new material and enough rocking and jamming as only these guys can do it you cannot go wrong.  Oh! one more thing!  PLAY IT LOUD!!!
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|ya know i was like so many people out there that wanted to actually preorder the movie and from what some have said its totally worth every dollar and if you want a movie that really has no plot at all other than the fact that its really the life of a stripper and how you can have the ups and downs of that life then by all means this is your movie. personally its not worth the $25 that i spent on the combo pack and like so many movies out there today if you dont have the blu ray player guess what NO BONUS CONTENT and the fact that the box says Steamy extras not seen in theatres is a blanit lie the only steamy scenes were deleated full dances of 3 count it 3 dances and 2 of them you get to see in the movie and not miss very much at all.<br />i will however give credit to the actors for making a movie where its a skin flick with other men. that saying i have a hard time (not literally) getting into this movie more then once truth be told this is one of those movies that you rent if there is nothing else out there to watch and its only better if you have a blu ray so you can see all the bonus content other then that this one wont take long to be in the cheap bin<br /><br />sorry cant say better then that 2 1/2 stars honestly and that half is for the actors in the movie not the plot
B004V5A7K8|3.0|too simple. needs more upgrades and challenges. like level ups that stick with you and I actually gets more difficult

B005LAJ16I|2.0|I think the first 7 episodes of Homeland are very good but after that it is not realistic that the wife of the imam comes to visit Carrie, behind the back of her husband, I think in real that never happens. The portrait of the imam is painted very idealistic, it promotes islam. For me I will look no further, overhere we have too much trouble with islam.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Ms. Dugard has come through the trials of hell and lived to tell about it. A wonderful recount of her survivors spirit. Some parts may be triggering for other victims of CSA and rape, but her honesty and her courage gives you courage to get through. She doesn't try to provide you with answers regarding her ordeal, for indeed there are no answers. Rather she pens her experiences with the triumphant spirit of a survivor.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|On a quad this is quite well made. Great free app and well worth .99.<br /><br />A couple of suggestions. 1) Make a little more difficult or add easy, difficult. Was on level 24 with 10 free games left. (Restore is an excellent feature to compensate for that)<br /><br />2) change fast and slow speeds more often adding to difficulty.<br /><br />Overall an excellent app Free app of the day and paid.<br /><br />Update. I coninue to play this game regularly and is quite challenging. Of all the game apps this is my favorite topping angry birds and leps world.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|A lot of bang for the buck. Getting 4 discs is worth the price alone. I still wish there was a directors cut by Ridley Scott. Extras are way more than the basic disc. I can't wait till the next one comes out. Great to enjoy! Must Have!
030759565X|5.0|I adore this cookbook. The pictures are second only to the recipes. The preface to each recipe is like standing in Deb's kitchen and talking with her while she slides a delectable cake into the oven.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|4 stars. I loved the emotional aspect of the book. Sex scenes were awesome. Gideon and eve have what every women wants in her life to be loved and cherished.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey does a super job in transporting the reader to this amazing world that has both mystery and familiarity. Each story is connected and they tease their way through a series of stoic characters that we all too briefly get to know before the last book in the series develops more fully with a growing suspense and tension that is cleverly constructed and always remarkably grounded.<br /><br />My first experience of this author and a very high standard of writing.<br /><br />Great stuff !
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game finaly someone got on the ball to fun town I remember when I really had to put so much money into the machine to win.now its here and free.....just love it.......Debz
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game (or should i say games) are so much fun. they are simple yet  challenging. so many choices to play and endless fun!  if you like simple games and variety...... get this!!!
0553801473|1.0|After reading this fantasy novel, a volume of a fantasy series, I was disappointed. I never expected there to be sooooooo many dancing dragons. While the silver dragon was a fairly competent dancer, I found the others lacking and, in the end, they contributed little to the overall narrative. As if that wasn't bad enough, what I found particularly disheartening was complete absence of the crows of feasting. What happened to all the crows? And the maids of milking . . . nothing! If the author of this fantasy series wants to bring back what has become a stagnant storyline, there must be a return of things make story good fun go team. UNICORNS!
B004ODLUGM|1.0|This product was intended for my 6 year old son. He insisted that I get him the Gruffalo as he heard the story in school. I went online, searched Amazon, found it and ordered the DVD version. One week later I get the product in the mail. I opened the package only to find a crumpled DVD case (the case is made of paper). Fearing the worst I gently opened the case and removed the bent out of shape DVD disk. It's not broken. I tried it in vain in my DVD player but it didn't work. Trying to satisfy my already disappointed son I then ordered the Gruffalo in paperback. He read it and loved it. It's the shipping standard that crushed this review.
B004I744AS|5.0|I think this is a great dictionary!  There has not been a day that goes by that I haven't looked up a word.  Playing words with friends might n<br />be the reason..  :-
B007THA4FI|3.0|So I finished reading the new JK Rowling book The Casual Vacancy last night. I must say it was a difficult read. While I was not expecting another Harry Potter novel I was expecting to at least see a bit of JK's humor and style of writing a bit more. The subject matter was not edge of your seat interesting and she jumped very quickly from charactor to charactor (so much so that I often found myself re-reading paragraphs in order to see who I was reading about) and it all seemed a bit forced and jumbled at times. I still found myself wanting to know what happened to the charactors but not so much thatI would call this a \\"cant put you down\\" book.  While I still look forward to more from her I must say that her first offical forray into \\"adult reading\\" missed the mark a bit. I think she may have tried too hard to branch away from her HP image with this one. JK, I still love you and will still wait with bated breath to see what you write next, I just hope you put more of your quirky style into it, and show us again why we fell in love with you in the first place.
0062059882|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I liked the way Neil Gaiman incorporated fantasy into modern life. Enjoyed contiplating the idea of the \\"Old Gods\\" versus the \\"New Gods\\" and with a good twist in the end.
0307352145|5.0|I enjoyed a lot reading this well written, thoroughly researched book. Being an introvert, I can say this was the first book or publication I read that says and demonstrates that being that way can be ok. Actually, it states that it can be more than ok, it can be really good!<br /><br />Part one, \\"The Extrovert Ideal\\", it is pointed that introverts usually have persistence and tolerate the solitude necessary to get expertise in a given field. It also shows that introverts can be good leaders. By the way, as a side benefit, the author's made me understand the western corporate world a bit more, when she shows how extroversion is overvalued in businesses (observe, for example, how MBA programs emphasize and value extroversion as key to leadership, albeit the existence of several successful introvert CEOs).<br /><br />Part two, \\"Your Biology, Your Self?\\" explores the biological roots of introversion. Although I was more interested in part one, this one was also very interesting. In part three, \\"Do All Cultures have An Extrovert Ideal?\\", I found it amazing to find how oriental culture tends to respect and value, more than in the west cultures, people who are introverts. I really think the western society I'm inserted into could learn a bit from this.<br /><br />Part four: \\"How to Love, How to Work\\" gives useful tips for educating introvert children in our society, and how to communicate to members of the opposite type.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect is that the author gives a lot of bibliographical references in the end, which must be useful for those who would like to dive deeper in the subject.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked reading this book. Sometimes, while I was reading, I thought \\"ok, the author is right, but the world won't change after I read this\\". In a manner, that's true, but than I remembered an inspiring George Bernard Shaw's quote: \\"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\\" . Thank you Susan Cain for being unreasonable and trying to make the world a better place for the introverts.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I loved this series. 4 stars because it was a little predictable at times but still great! Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|Duran Duran had to cancel the last leg of their 2011/2012 world tour, which included the August show at the Fraze Pavilion in Kettering, OH. My wife & I were scheduled to attend, we were heartbroken; nevertheless, this Blu-ray is fantastic. Great price, and fast delivery. No one else had this product available.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i honestly cant believe all the bad reviews. i loved all three books. if you look beyond the porn and really see the plot for what it is its an amazing love story. you take the main characters one is a some what shy young girl with no life experience that falls for this man thats for lack of a better word screwed up. hes very accomplished with a shady past. they help eachother grow into the people they were always meant to be. i enjoyed watching them help eachother and grow page by page. amazing i laughed i cried i swooned. best read<br />spell errors and punctuation errors due to small kindle keypad
B001URY5IU|4.0|This was a nice set but was small for the money. Lego sets are generally pricey but this one was especially small.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i truly love this app! theres so many things you can do! so many different ways you can edit a photo! its so much better than INSTAGRAM!
1904994768|3.0|Overall this is a good book. It is probably a one time read but interesting for gamers.I would probably not buy it again just go to the library!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The first book and this one are good reads.  I can't wait till May when the next one comes out.  Good good books!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun even for this middle aged guy who started playing so he could be his wife's neighbor.<br />Best feature: everything can be done with free resources, either coins or gifts from neighbors. And nothing spoils if you have to leave it unattended.<br />Worst feature:ever increasing prompts to play other TeamLava games and do limited time goals.<br /><br />Overall, cute and low pressure gameplay means I'll stick with it because sending gold and maps to my wife is still fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book but it was great. I am sure the second book will be great
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Not only did I enjoy the usual good read and humor Mr Cory always displayes, but I learned a lot about the middle East and some of the problems over there and why they have come to our shores.

B005IKZ1B0|5.0|This music is awesome. Great beat and great vocals. David Guetta is the man. I will follow this artist forever
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have such a different feeling when I read a Reacher book.  With so many other novels, I am happy to read them but often find other things to read at the same time.  When I start with Reacher, I feel like the end of every chapter just means I need to start the next.  As usual, this has you thinking you know what is going on but you find out how wrong you are at each turn.  Very well written.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really like this case even before I got my kindle and it looks amazing and protects great dont no what I'd do without it.
0316228532|5.0|Countering the negative reviews on Amazon, I enjoyed the book. It is heavy on character development, which many seem to decry...the Amazon reviews lament that and lack of plot. Well..in my humble opinion too few authors develop their characters, and she does a smashing job here :-) had to sound a tad British. You will recognize many of the characters in your families, friends, neighbors; I cared deeply for many, loathed quite a few, and feared for others. At one point, when you see what is going to happen, you will be shouting through the pages for characters to see what is right in front of them..as you would in a horror movie when someone is about to go off alone etc. Point of view is expressed beautifully...along with it denial, rationalization, and justification. She is depicting life, and despite it hitting close to home, and perhaps not the escape some Amazon readers want, I truly admire her writing for so, so many reasons. Yeah, a traditional plot line would be hard to summarize here...but if you can't stand the cardboard characters in so many novels you come across, pick this up, and read it.<br /><br />Keep in mind that one of the reasons Harry Potter was so wonderful, was her ability to develop the characters, engaging her readers so intensely, that we longed for more.  She made fantasy real, via her character development, and that skill (so rare) is wonderfully depicted in The Casual Vacancy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaacson is a great biographer - This is as good as his bio of Kissinger.  He shows that you would not want to be a friend or relative of Steve Jobs, but America was lucky to have him as an entrepreneur.  Sadly for Jobs, his brilliance did not extend to personal lifestyle and health issues.  A great read.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|A great read, kept me enthralled throughout. I highly recommend to anybody who wants a fast paced series that actually concludes without leaving space for another series of additions.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Very good season, seems like they get better and better each season!  Does not disappoint at all!I absolutely love this show!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game but played through it fairly quickly.  Only took me a few days to finish. So I'm glad it was the free download of the day when I got it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very fun game!!! Glad I installed the ad-free version because when I had the one that wasn't ad-free, the ads became very annoying and made playing the game less enjoyable.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|My wife and I purchased the Wiithings Smart Baby Monitor about a month ago.  It seemed awesome at the time being able to monitor our baby from our iPhones thus eliminating the need to carry an extra monitor.  But, not more than two weeks later, the application stopped working on our iPhones.  The application on our iphones (4S) would kept showing \\"Connection Error Unable to retrieve Smart Baby Monitor connection information.\\"  My wife actually had found out that the monitor stopped working the next day when she saw this message on her phone.  I immediately contacted Wiithings and they responded within 24 hours.  Unfortunately, it was apparent that this was a known issue as support provided us with a PDF document on how to correct the problem!!  Being in IT, I could not bring myself to accept a product where a particular issue was so prevalent that a procedural guide was created on how to correct the problem.  In addition, it seemed that this issue would be reoccurring and not a one time fix.  Thoughts our of newborn daughter screaming through the night as we slept peacefully were playing through our minds.  The other thing that was annoying was the fact that there was a delay between what was seen/heard on the application and what was happening where the monitor was placed (baby room).  It was almost like watching something in slow motion as you could see the baby's arm move slowly from left to right like a someone flipping the pages of a book with a picture.  I am sure this was due to the Bluetooth connection but establishing a LAN line to the monitor was not something we were interested in doing.<br /><br />So, we sent the monitor back to Amazon who promptly refunded our purchase.  We ended up buying the Motorola [[ASIN:B004VL2VRO Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 Inch]].
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love the actors, it was worth the money to not have to surf around different channels, we are now watching Life on Netflix same actor.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|While I was expecting a quirky movie, and it is quirky to a fault as another reviewer mentioned, it felt like Saturday Night Live skit of an aging boomer's idealized memories that went on waaaay tooo loonnggg. I could only stomach 45 minutes.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|amasen and great and i loved it and im hoping they come out with more Ice Age Village on the kindle<br />and that's all i have to say.
0061900656|5.0|Was looking for a book that would help encourage our soon to be 3 yr old son \\"big brother\\". This book is very appropriate for this age group and explains all aspects of having a new baby such as; babys are not able to play right away, youre still special, its ok when babys cry, etc. I am very glad we purchased this book. The only downside I'd mention is that the book itsnt as large as I was expecting but overall a very good book.
0316228532|5.0|The back jacket of this book reads, in part, \\"She [JK Rowling] supports a wide range of causes and is the founder of Lumos, which works to transform the lives of disadvantaged children.\\"  This book is about that reality along with class system/prejudices/small town/small minds. If you want a warm/fuzzy book this is not for you.  If you want \\"reality\\" this is for you.  Great read with definite impact.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|I bought this for my son. He thought this was his best bey.  He said it was more stable and beat out all his other beys in battles!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|While searching for 'Kindle for PC' and 'Kindle for Windows 7', your search ignored the details and kept returning results for Android. If Kindle is not available for PCs, say so. If it is, return it in the results.
0385344333|4.0|I enjoy the jack reacher series very much . But this book is mot my favorite. Although it has all the intricate detailing and the constant twisting of the clues which keeps the reader turning the pages.so I would definitely recommend it.
0061692042|4.0|The choice of language was a little disturbing. The hints of what was to follow interrupted the flow. The characters were interesting.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I purchased this item because my charger cord that came with my Kindle fire kicked the bucket and I do not know why; except that I am not the only consumer with this problem.  So, far this USB cord has worked and feels sturdier than the original and allows me to use it with various USB adapter.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This game was given an update on October 9th and this version has yet to be updated.  Why the heck is this taking so long?  This is getting to the point where it is almost comical, only it isn't funny.  Update already.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I only read before I go to bed, both books have kept me up later then I wanted to be.  Very good, not quite sure if they are what I expected.
B007N8RULO|5.0|this game is totally awesome. but it is sadly addicting. I cant stop playing it. and I love the hint button cause I'm not the best at this game
B00846REIS|3.0|The story really is way to sexual and not enough going on except sex and more sex.Not my idea of good reading
B008XG1X18|5.0|it's just like the website but in an app form! its easy to use and handy since it's on my mobile device!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I simply love this game. I don't have to spend a fortune to play. Its a great game to play to pass time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|On Android phones or tablets, this game ropes me in every time! It's a little hard adjusting to a larger screen, but give yourself a couple minutes and you won't be able to put it down!
B007XF4J70|5.0|Everyone has heard of the movie Casablanca. But has everyone seen it. They definitely should. This 70th Anniversary Edition is the best release I've ever seen. I've owned this movie on VHS, twice on DVD( b/c an ex-girlfriend ganked it when she bailed on me), and twice on Blu-ray. This edition is great. It is loaded with extra features, and the video quality is superb. Whether you have this movie or not, especially if you haven't seen it. You really should have this edition of Casablanca. It's definitely the best ever.
B005FPT51K|4.0|We were looking for a camera to keep an eye out on our daughter. I read several reviews about various cameras and  intially decided to go for the Foscam because of the price and they got decent reviews. I spent over 6 hours trying to get these things set up. I was able to get them working at home and on my iphone (but not remotely). I started delving into port forwarding and a whole bunch of other technical things I don't really understand. I watched you tube videos on setting these up and searched all over the web for articles to help me, but I still got stuck. In the end my frustration won and I decided to return these. I got the ibaby and called it a day. The ibaby is more expensive and may not have all the features of the foscam but I set it up in about 2 minutes and it still does what we are looking for.I did have to do a little bit of searching to figure out how to view the camera from my phone without wifi but it can be done and the instructions on doing this are so much clearer than they were for the foscam.
B00406UK7S|4.0|In 177A.D. the Roman conquest of Britain is being thwarted by guerrillas in the north.Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a raid on a frontier fortress . He joins with the forces of General Virilus and the 9th Legion. Their mission is to eradicate the Pict resistance. Quintus face terrible odds as he tries to rescue his General and regain the honor of the Legion.<br /><br />This movie is very entertaining. It's got good acting, cinematography, and a fairly solid story line. It lacks a little bit in the way of character development, but it delivers a good experience nonetheless. I wasn't disappointed by this movie. It's a good addition to anyone's collection.
1423140605|3.0|Honestly, it was a great read.  I feel like there was some plot nerfing of characters, but overall i enjoyed it.  I only scored it as low as I did because initially I remember reading this would be a 3 book series.  Finding out there's another 2 books on the way killed a lot of the enthusiasm I had for this one.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|This movie a legend. It explores the emotions of a man that has lost everything...except his life. Stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere, Chuck Noland lives alone with only the hope of returning to civilization and the one he loves. His trials are great and he stands at the frayed edges of sanity. This is an inspiring tale of hope, loss, and determination. If you haven't seen Cast Away you need to remedy the situation and buy this film in Blu-ray. If you have seen Cast Away you need to buy this film in Blu-ray. The picture quality and audio are very good. This is the best way to watch this great movie.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I did not discover Sons of Anarchy until very recently.  For the last several months, I have been immersed in the series.  Season 4 is on par with Seasons 1 through 3.  This is an extremely well-written series that keeps you wanting more.  The characters are very well drawn out and the plot lines are interesting and action-<br />packed.  Very addicting series!!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Though I love Sparks character depth as always, the plot has been played out in movies and books for decades.  I did appreciate the depth of the Kevin character complete with inner dialogue...However, I would not recommend this book.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Here's my opinion: ff you like rock and musicals with left leaning overtones, you'll love this movie.  The main stars are unknowns with the big name stars having more of supporting type roles.  Tom Cruise really did a great job.  He really stepped out of his comfort zone and was very believable.  I thought his performance was the best in the movie.  I'm not much of a musicals fan, so, that's why I rated it 3 stars.  It didn't reach me all that much.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|whilst reading this book on my lunch break a stranger asked me if i was okay, reason being through the strain of preventing myself from laughing out loud i had big fat tears rolling down my face, when i tried to explain my state to the poor stranger i began to howl with laughter and hiccup with tears at the same time. thankfully the men in white coats didnt turn up this time :) a great light-hearted read i reccomend to all my peeps
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app continues to suck, now it won't play the sample tunes. I kept using it since my info was stored on amazon for non- dloads and they have a paymeent system The MP3 app is SO So Lame, this app sucks and so does the tech support. Of course they set it up to make it easy to dload stuff you don't even want. You'd think Amazon would invest some money in tech support to keep their vending machine taking in money. Lame, find another one.

B008OJ291W|5.0|Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) have one of the most interesting pedigrees in rock & pop music. Originally formed as almost a side project of the band The Move, by Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne, who had both emerged from The Idle Race, with Lynne following Roy Woods as lead vocalist and guitarist and then joining him in The Move.The Move were a very successful English rock band scoring nine Top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most popular British bands not to find any success in the United States. The Move could best be described as a Psychedelic/Hard Rock Band.<br /><br />Roy Wood had an idea to form a new band that would use classical instruments; violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound, taking rock music in the direction \\"that The Beatles had left off. Jeff Lynne, who had taken over frontman duties from Wood in The Idle Race was excited by the concept and ELO was formed. Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and \\"10538 Overture\\" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. To help finance the fledgling band, two more Move albums were released during the lengthy ELO recordings. The resulting debut album The Electric Light Orchestra was released in 1971.<br /><br />By 72 Woods left the band and Lynne took over and would be the stable member until the band broke up in '86. Their list of hits during the period are astounding and are some of the most played tunes on Classic Rock station even today.<br /><br />What makes the album unique is that Lynne, who is also a great producer, rerecorded the tunes and the release coincides with Lynne's solo album, Long Wave. Jeff Lynne has artfully revisited and re-recorded--at his home studio in Los Angeles--the greatest hits of Electric Light Orchestra, actually improving on some of the most classic and beloved recordings ever.The album is a powerful testament to Lynne's enduring artistry and his singular desire to get things right once and for all. Featuring such classics as \\"Evil Woman, \\"Don't Bring Me Down,\\" \\"Livin' Thing\\" and \\"Mr, Blue Sky,\\" the result is, in effect, a kind of showdown between JEFF LYNNE today and his extremely illustrious past, and thanks to improved technology and recording artistry, LYNNE somehow comes out on top again. It's a fresh chance to hear these extraordinary songs sounding sharper and clearer than the old versions.<br /><br />Mr. Blue Sky-The Very Best Of ELO 2012As good as the originals were, or are still, the remixes are astounding After 40 years it is as if the tunes are reimagined and the technology remakes the tunes and makes them feel complete.<br /><br />The songs that Jeff Lynne wrote and sang--and the recordings that he so expertly arranged and produced for ELO--have endured beautifully and are perhaps even more beloved today than they were back in the Seventies and Eighties. By any standard whatsoever, ELO is one of the most remarkable<br />success stories in rock history. Consider just the facts: ELO has sold over 50 million records worldwide, and continues to be a remarkably popular.<br /><br />Between 1972 and 1986, Lynne wrote and produced 26 Top Forty hits in the United Kingdom, and 20 Top Forty hits in the United States, including 20 Top Twenty smashes in the UK and 15 Top Twenty smashes in the U.S.<br /><br />Outside of the success of ELO, Lynne has led a remarkable career that has found him taking the lessons learned leading ELO and using them to help produce and collaborate with many of the greatest musical artists of all time, including a number of Lynne's all-time heroes including Roy Orbison, Del Shannon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and remarkably, even the Beatles themselves, as well as contemporaries like Tom Petty and Joe Walsh,<br /><br />He is consider among the top 5 producers in rock and roll, and that production artistry come through on this album.is singular desire to get things right once and for all.

B008Y5OW20|4.0|Jeff Lynne hardly needs an introduction. The man founded one of the iconic prog rock bands in history, Electric Light Orchestra. he went on to be the force behind that most unusual of \\"super groups\\",  Traveling Wilburys along with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. Additionally Lynne has produced recordings for artists such as The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Roy Orbison, Dave Edmunds, Del Shannon and Tom Petty.  In 2008, The Washington Times named Lynne the fourth greatest record producer in music history. He has co-written songs with Petty and also with George Harrison, whose 1987 album Cloud Nine was co-produced by Lynne and Harrison. Among the many compositions to his credit are such well-known hits as \\"Livin' Thing\\", \\"Evil Woman\\", \\"Turn to Stone\\", \\"Do Ya\\", \\"Xanadu\\", \\"Strange Magic\\", \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\", \\"Telephone Line\\", \\"Shine a Little Love\\", \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\", \\"Hold on Tight\\", \\"All Over the World\\", and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\".<br /><br />Not bad for a kid from Shard End, Birmingham whose first guitar, an acoustic instrument, was bought for him by his father, for £2. By the way, he's still playing it in 2012. In 1963 he formed a group with Robert Reader and David Walsh using little more than Spanish guitars and cheap electrical instruments to produce music. They were originally named \\"The Rockin' Hellcats\\" before changing to \\"The Handicaps\\" and finally to \\"The Andicaps\\". They practiced at Shard End Community Centre and performed weekly. However, in 1964, Robert Reader and David Walsh left the band and Lynne brought in replacements. At the end of 1964, Lynne decided to leave the band to replace Mick Adkins of the local band \\"The Chads\\".Some time in or after 1965, he acquired his first item of studio recording equipment, a Bang & Olufsen 'Beocord 2000 De Luxe' stereo reel-to-reel tape recorder, which allowed multi-tracking between left and right channels.He says it \\"taught me how to be a producer\\".In 1966, Lynne joined the line-up of The Nightriders as guitarist. The band would soon change their name to The Idle Race, a name allegedly given to them sarcastically by his grandmother Evelyn Lynne who probably disapproved of pop music as not being a proper job.<br /><br />Despite recording two critically acclaimed albums with the band and producing the second, success eluded him. In 1970, Lynne accepted a lifeline from friend Roy Wood to join the line-up of the more successful band The Move. The Move scored nine Top 20 UK singles in five years, but were among the most popular British bands not to find any success in the United States. Lynne contributed many songs to The Move's last two albums while formulating, with Roy Wood and Bev Bevan, a band built around a fusion of rock and classical music. This project would eventually become the highly successful Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). Problems led to Wood's departure in 1972, after the band's eponymous first album, leaving Lynne as the band's dominant creative force. Thereafter followed a succession of band personnel changes and increasingly popular albums which we'll get into deeper in the next review which features not only the most popular commercial and critical success of Lynne's career, but also yet another place we shall see those producing credentials but a life-long love, \\" ...what I love doing is overdubbing and making new sounds out of things that are sometimes quite ordinary...\\", says Lynne.<br /><br />The Move circa 1970 w/ Roy Wood and Jeff LynneAs much as Lynne loves \\"tinkering\\" with gadgets, as he has from the start with that old Beocord. Right up there with things that occupy his mind and move his soul are the songs and music that influenced him when he was growing up, and even after he became a star in his own right. Long Wave celebrates the music of a time when Lynne's lifelong passion for music began, evoking an era back when old standards were just giving way to rock & roll. He somehow makes pre-rock standards like \\"Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered,\\" \\"Smile\\" and \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Many Thing\\"--along with a few of his favorite gems from the Sixties such as the first single \\"Mercy, Mercy,\\" \\"Let It Rock\\" and \\"So Sad\\"--his own with these loving versions. Lynne's deeply felt and musically brilliant one-man-band takes add up to an inspired love letter to music itself--and an exquisite reflection of the way songs grace and change our lives.<br /><br />\\"I call this new album Long Wave because all of the songs I sing on it are the ones heard on long wave radio when I was a kid growing up in Birmingham, England,\\" LYNNE explains. \\"These songs take me back to that feeling of freedom in those days and summon up the feeling of first hearing those powerful waves of music coming in on my old crystal set. My dad also had the radio on all the time, so some of these songs have been stuck in my head for 50 years. You can only imagine how great it felt to finally get them out of my head after all these years.\\"<br /><br />Though Electric Light Orchestra was formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. The sound that got them known as \\"The English guys with the big fiddles\\", ELO were on the driving edge of bands starting to add, and even play, classical music and classically arranged music. Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Jethro Tull, and even The Moody Blues (who had been adding elements of classical for awhile) brought some order to the rebellious and wild side of rock and roll. Some think this was wrong for rock and roll, however the youngsters of the 60s were, as a whole, ready to embrace, if not the order, then a growth and maturity in how their music was composed. In addition to classical elements, Lynne used all the studio tricks which were to become the fare of the day for years to come; over dubbing, synthesizers, mixing orchestra strings with blazing rock guitars, effects and on live shows they used coloured lasers light shows, fog machines. and highly produced stage shows. But behind this urge to `make rock grow up', there was still the lessons from before rock. The old songs, and before Lynne was successful in his many bands leading up to ELO. In many ways that respect for the `old' music was what led to the formation of Traveling Wilburys with three of his idols, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, and most importantly Roy Orbison.<br /><br />Long Wave comes full circle and really surpasses The Willbury's in paying his respects to his roots. Included are standards from \\"Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered\\" written by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart to \\"Smile\\" co-written by Charlie Chaplin and made famous by Nat King Cole to \\"So Sad\\" made famous by The Everly Brothers and Chuck Berry's driving \\"Let It Rock\\"  and \\"Mercy Mercy,\\" a soulful early Sixties gem from Don Covay and The Goodtimers and as Lynne recalls, the first song he ever learned and played professionally. What's more the album has, in contrast to ELOs studio and live wizardry, a Lo-Fi feel. Lynne plays all the instruments on the album, so there had to be some over dubbing and mastering magic going on, but that is the extent of it. The band feels like a group that might have played a sock hop in the high school gym back around 1958 or so. Further, the instruments sound vintage, and I'd be willing to bet that that £2 guitar is somewhere, if not everywhere on this wonderful album.wildered,\\" \\"Smile\\" and \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Many Thing\\"--along with a few of his favorite gems from the Sixties such as the first single \\"Mercy, Mercy,\\" \\"Let It Rock\\" and \\"So Sad\\"--his own with these loving versions.

0316228532|4.0|As a rabid fan of Harry Potter, I wasn't quite sure what to anticipate as I dove into this novel.  While I didn't expect it to be anything like Potter, I also didn't quite expect it to be anything like it is.  I can understand why some Potter fans don't like this book, as it is quite different, not just in subject matter (which I think everyone anticipated anyway, as Rowling was quite clear all along that this book was very different), but in tone.  Some minor spoilers to follow.<br /><br />This is a bleak book.  There's no other way to put it, really.  With the Potter books, even when things were extraordinarily dark, there was always a glimmer of hope underneath, a sense of goodness inherent to humanity, and several messages of redemption.  These things are somewhat present in this book, but not in the same way.  There's no need for a Voldemort in this book, because regular human beings do a fine job of destroying one another, whether it's through their outright malice or their casual indifference.  I think this book is a much more scathing exploration of the smallness of human nature, whereas the Potter books offered up beautiful glimmers of humanity.<br /><br />Another reason why I think this book may be difficult to love is that none of the characters are entirely loveable.  Unlike with Potter, where there were clear heroes, clear villains, and some villains who turned out to be not quite so villainous, the characters in this book are complex human beings, most of whom are motivated by their own petty selfishness and their sense of self-righteousness.  They are people who have been wounded and so feel the right to wound right back, no matter the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />However, as critical as that may sound, I thought this was actually an excellent book because it so affected me.  I kept reading, desperately hoping things would get better for Krystal and Robbie, or for Sukhvinder, that Fats/Stuart might wake up and realize the havoc he so casually wrought, that Ruth might find the strength to stand up to her husband, that Kay might finally wake up and realize how much Gavin was using her.  I sympathized with these characters at times, felt exasperated with them at others, and downright disliked them at still other moments.  But they were all so human.  I could identify with their struggles, and I wanted good things to happen for them all.  At various points, this book made me laugh, made me cringe, and made me cry--especially at the end.<br /><br />That, I think, is Rowling's true strength.  Her characters are so vivid, their emotions so authentic that you can't help but care, and care deeply.  Whether she's writing about a boy wizard or an angry woman wanting to punish her husband for his indifference to their marriage, Rowling gets at the heart of humanity with her writing, and it's a skill that I think is phenomenal.  To my mind, there is no question that Rowling can write, and write well.  I read a lot, and I enjoy many books, but it's far rarer for a book to really touch me, to really play with my emotions, and every book by Rowling that I've ever read has done this.  She is consistently able to not only tell me a story, but to make me feel.<br /><br />Still, it's not what I'd call a perfect book.  It takes some time to get into it, and I found the omniscient third person narrator very confusing at times, particularly when I'd read a scene with multiple characters and would find myself jumping from one character's head to another.  It took a while for me to remember which character was which and, even at the end of the book, I sometimes had to take a moment to connect the characters with their back stories.  This was a really ambitious book, and it had a few flaws that worked against it.<br /><br />While I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a light read that will restore your faith in humanity, I did think it was excellent.  Yet, I confess that, the next time Rowling writes something, I hope it'll be a bit happier.  I'm not sure I can take this level of misery on a regular basis.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|I finisehd The Fault In Our Stars and although I didn't cry my heart broke for the two main characters; Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters which meet after Hazel joins a support group after being diagnosed with depression.<br /><br />These two develop a relationship and I would go on record as being one of the realest fictional relationships I have read.<br /><br />Hazel introduces Augustus to her favourite book; An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten which is about living a good life with cancer however it ends mid-sentence. The two venture to Amsterdam to meet Peter to find out what happened. After being disheartened they head to the Anne Frank museum where after being there they share a passionate kiss.<br /><br />From here on in the story takes the reader on a emotional roller-coaster in which I was hooked to my eReader in which by the end I wasn't a weeping mess but felt pain for the characters. The reality of what I have experienced with cancer myself; the author portrayals a realism that makes the memories come back.<br /><br />I have also been a part of these support groups; myself suffering from a chronic health condition and eventually leaving because it did more harm then good. I also felt very sad when the last six chapters because I have had a family member die of cancer within the last two years and my mother was a carer for him.<br /><br />This is the first John Green book I have read; I plan to read more however I want a breather for a moment as that was one hell of a book.
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|It would be difficult to assign enough stars to this set.  The coverage is magnificent, encompassing Gould's entire career and the individual recordings are pristine, perfectly revealing Gould's precise and exacting approach to Bach.  Because of this breadth there are duplicates of several pieces, including at least 4 Goldberg Variations, from different stages of his career, including the notable 1954 and 1981 recordings. It is fascinating to examine these back to back to see how his interpretations evolved over time. The pairings for both the sonatas and concertos are excellent as well.  And the pricing reduces to near-unbelievable per-disc price.  An accompanying book includes liner notes and several additional articles.  There are also several discs with interviews which are very revealing of Gould's approach to the music (and life as well).  If ever there were a set to take along to a desert island this is it and you'd never be bored.

B009OZ690C|5.0|If you are looking for Shindler's List, move on.<br /><br />This is a mass market production for a young audience - while at the same time - it is the most successful, longest-running series in the horror / adventure genre in modern television.  I find it consistent and compelling through its Monster of the Week (MOTW) and over-arching, season-wide, big-bad.  Almost every episode will give me a \\"jump\\" or a decent \\"yuk!\\".  Supernatural is probably most successful at bridging the audiences of Buffy and Charmed, and making contact with the new age of Vampire Diaries and Twilight.  Do not overlook the influence of \\"Mc G\\"!  He keeps the episodes fresh, contemporary and makes the soundtrack as influential as a main character... perhaps best described as simply adding \\"character.\\"  He will spend money on the rights for the PERFECT song, and it shows!<br /><br />Though never a slam-dunk ratings champ, Supernatural always performed well and earned its place in the lineup every single season.  That should tell you that you may want to get involved.  This is the last season - probably for the best - but the reruns are everywhere and the DVDs are very well produced.<br /><br />I'm a fan.  Good popcorn television.<br /><br />CASTIEL LIVES!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have never had a problem with any of the previous updates, but this one would not work on our LG Optimus V phones. After two emails and two phone calls to support, I was finally able to get the apk for the previous version.  You MUST uninstall the current version before downloading and installing this one.  Worked for me and my wife.    [...]    You may now resume reading.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Glitch free and this app has no issues with Kindle fire.  I found it worth the $0.99 in exchange of hours of entertainment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent followup to the original. Cant  wait for the next novel to see if love conquers all in the end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Challenging &amp; fun but you're practically forced to use real money in order to enjoy the game fully. Must try!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Must. play. mooooorrreee.<br /><br />I cant seem to stop playing this game at all. Its a great dungeon crawled. Reminds me of diablo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is better than temple run seriously it is awesome buy it now and Sanaa. buy this too jsnsns abs she s w w
B0067EMFLA|5.0|I heard half of one of Icon For Hire's songs in a friends car, and it was stuck in my head for weeks until I finally figured out who it was. I went to Youtube and played their songs over and over and over but it wasn't enough!LOL! I broke down and bought the album, as a download because I just couldn't wait for it to be shipped to me. Since then, I've probably listened through the cd at least once a day, sometimes more. The lyrics are fantastic and the cd instantly has me singing along. My 2nd favorite band of all time!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very enjoyable and addicting. I find myself going back to it again and again. The only thing I have t watch out for is spending really money on it its hard not just buy gems because I'm impatient.
B00445WF28|5.0|Loved season 1 so much that had to watch season 2.  The first episode in season 2 was just as funny! The quality was good!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is great game. It kept me entertained and was never boring. I am looking forward to the next one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a awesome game I love it SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I wish I could have a game that I love to do it is so fun! LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FUN LOVE IT
B002UZ5JJU|4.0|This was a fun and insight fully entertaining book about how to get over a long term relationship and move on with a new life.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app! Instead of going through my Kindle fire HD settings, I can just go straight to the app you guys and/or gals have created! I especially love how it shows how long it will take to charge before the battery is completely charged! I use this app everyday to check my battery percentage and how long it will charge.I always encourage my friends that have android devices and kindle fires to download the app because it is state of the art! Just please don't stop making super cool apps! :-) -Cariann B. :*)
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love all her books. And this one is just as good. I will be very very sad to finish it.
B003CN5SAY|4.0|Loved that show and felt very sad when it ended. Loved the humor and decadence of the people involved.<br />They did whatever they felt like and did not fell hardly any guilt. Very interesting characters..all of them.<br />Viva plastic surgery
B00846REIS|5.0|Hot, steamy, emotional, and full of romance...couldn't ask for more!!!! The only negative is it ended too soon. I wanted it to keep going! Love the characters.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|The story centers around two New York City police officers, Nick Conklin & Charlie Vincent, who arrest a member of the Yakuza and are tasked with escorting him back to Japan. Once there, he escapes, and the two police officers find themselves dragged deeper and deeper into the Japanese underworld. The film was directed by Ridley Scott, whom all of you know as the Director of Alien and Blade Runner.<br /><br />Most of the time, I'm not really into movies of this sort. Why? Well, movies of this sort are, usually, an excuse for lots of violence and action in the movie. I'm more into characterization and a good tale, something a little deeper-shall we say. I do like a good action movie every once in awhile but I prefer the aforementioned more in my movies(course, you wouldn't know that with all the zombie movies I've reviewed as of late, lol). At any rate, this movie gave me both and in good measure. I'm quite surprised at how well Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia play off each others' strengths in this movie to make it believable that these two are more like family than friends. Kate Capshaw and Ken Takakura put in very good performances as well. I agree with another reviewer here that Garcia & Takakura's Karoake scene is priceless...it's my favorite scene in the whole movie, lol. It's a brilliant movie, a deep movie and a fun movie...all rolled into one.<br /><br />However, I'll be honest-though- the movie does show its' age. You can tell it was made in the 80s. Still, this movie is definitely worth recommending and owning in your collection. You'll find yourself watching it time and again, it is that good!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Hot, steamy, emotional, and full of romance...couldn't ask for more!!!! The only negative is it ended too soon. I wanted it to keep going! Love the characters. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE... CAN'T WAIT FOR BOOK 3
B006LSZECO|5.0|My wife often questioned why I would sit in my car in the driveway for 15+ minutes after I got home from work....Until she started listening to it.
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|We all know the story. Oasis broke up in 2009 amid another tense brawl between the Gallagher brothers. Liam went on to form Beady Eye with the remaining members of the band, while Noel went on hiatus for nearly 2 years before gracing the music world with this much anticipated and remarkable rock solo album.<br /><br />It is evident Noel's talent for belting out classics has not diminished. The proof lies in tracks like If I Had A Gun, which is a reworking, and an equally contagious version, of the Oasis classic Wonderwall, the soaring orchestra-laced Everybody's On The Run, the foot stomping and elusive (Standed On) The Wrong Beach, the incredibly written ballad AKA...Broken Arrow, the dance track AKA...What A Life, and the Neil Young inspired The Death Of You And Me. The album also includes the previously unreleased Oasis tracks Stop The Clocks and (I Wanna Live In A Dream In My) Record Machine, but re-recorded by Noel -I personally liked the Oasis versions more.<br /><br />Noel Gallagher's solo debut is an oustanding album, an instant classic for hardcore Oasis fans. I just can't wait to see what the Chief will come up with next.<br /><br />And just to let you know, High Flying Birds is a superior record to Beady Eye's album.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />A
B007THA4FI|5.0|This was very well written. Ms. Rowling has an incredible penchant for developing characters. The storylines were developed and written with well studied knowledge. Shes proven that she can cross genres with ease and do it quite well. Well done!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling creates a tale interweaving the lives of various citizens of Pagford through vignettes of each character's life. Initially the many names allow for some confusion for the reader (which one was Fat's father? Is Samantha Miles's wife or someone else's?) But, give it a few chapters. As the names and roles are fleshed out, the tale comes together nicely. My expectation for this book was for it not to be remotely like Harry Potter and Rowling meets that. The conversational and situational crudeness may be realistic, but come across as over-the-top after awhile--an exclamation point to \\"this is not Hogwarts!\\"<br />Rowling is a gifted story teller and I look forward to more books from her.<br /><br />BTW, did anyone else have a picture in their head of Howard Mollison that resembled Harry Potter's uncle?
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Saw this as a child and was mesmerized by this movie (even more so by Claudia Cardinale - WOW).  Love it even more now.  Not sure the younger generation would have the patience with this type of movie where the camera actually stays with one shot for more than 5 seconds but I think this is one of the best Western's ever made!
B009PJAC5K|5.0|What can I say! Big Bang Theory is always hilarious. Not sure how they nail it episode after episode. Watching Amy be jealous over Sheldon's new assistant was interesting. She is such a funny person!
B008M721MS|5.0|it's a great way to keep in touch. so many of my friends on Facebook use it & altho I may never meet them in person I can meet them thru skype. Love it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game play it all the time on my Kindle Fire. At first I thought this game was boring but it's not to me I don't know about others.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love that they finally got bb available for the kindle fire! I did not have any trouble connecting to fb through it. Only concern I have is that I can not play any of the slot rooms, rome, or even berlin.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|i think its a good game but if u really want to keep playing and u need some money cuz u cant really get higher weapons armor and potions with out and or else u need to do some mad playing to get to the levels that offer higher weapons and stuff
1451695195|1.0|Probably a great book for non-believers. much like Eben himself.  I still don't understand who Om was supposed to be or anything about<br />the \\"Core\\".  I look for people to see Jesus Christ, but if you don't know anything about Him here on earth, I guess you get information<br />about things like Om and Core.  The best part of his story deals with the discovery that his deceased sister (whom he had never seen)<br />had turned out to be his guide in the spirit world.  I couldn't relate to the rest of his experience.  George Ritchie's \\"Return From<br />Tomorrow\\" amazes me every time I read it, and since the 1970's I have read everything I can get my hands on about this subject.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I can't believe they pulled it off. I love this movie. So much win. The team has a shaky beginning but, when it hits the fan, they band together to fix the problem. Can't wait for the next one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great reading for mature audience.  One you don't want to put down until your done.  Starting the second one now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ok solo first of all its solo much fun but it took a longgg time to loos but it is soo awesome
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book to me seems to be a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray. It has a different story line but as for characters names are similar. I didn't recommend this to people when co workers asked about it I told them don't waste your time if you read Fifty Shades.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was an excellent example of suspense, it kept you hooked until the very last page.  Strongly detailed characters whom you felt empathy for even though they had many personality flaws.  Gillian Flynn has a knack for creating lots of twists and turns, keeping the reader guessing until the very end.  It's a book that's hard to put down, and when you do put it down, you're still thinking about it and wondering what could possibly happen next.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good \\"whodunit\\".
0345803485|5.0|I love this series. I recommend it to everyone. I had the whole series read in less than a week. Now I am anxious to see if there actually is a fourth book to come out.
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I love a couple of his new songs, but the others were not what I expected.  I love the title song
1451695195|3.0|Like many others who have read Eben Alexander's book, I was captivated from start to finish.  I couldn't put it down.  Dr. Alexander knows how to weave the various elements of the storyline together, beginning with a potentially fatal free-fall while skydiving; through the very end, where Appendix A verifies, from one of Dr. Alexander's own physicians, that he really was ill with an incredibly rare form of meningitis.  The scientists and physicians who read his account (and there will be many, who, like me, have heard him lecture in his role as an academic neurosurgeon) will always want to pick it apart for what it doesn't say.  We want to know what his EEG showed.  We want to know what antibiotics he received.  We want to know if all of those findings he described on CT were miraculously gone when he suddenly awoke.  Of course, none of those are important to the story.  Dr. Alexander's stated purpose in writing the book is to \\"honor truth and help heal.\\"  This experience obviously had a profound effect on the rest of his life, but I'm curious - did he ever return to practicing neurosurgery?  Or is he now a full time NDE proponent?<br />There will be many Christians who read this book who will wonder exactly how Dr. Alexander managed to \\"know God\\" - he states, \\"I didn't just believe in God, I knew God\\" - without encountering Jesus.  After all, Jesus said, \\"I go to prepare a place for you\\" so he must be there somewhere.  Is it possible that Heaven is such a big place that Dr. Alexander just didn't happen to run into him?  If so, that would have profound implications for Christians who took Jesus seriously when he said, \\"Because I live, you will also live. On that day you will realize that I am in the Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. He who loves me will be loved by my Father.\\"  There is no question that Dr. Alexander felt deeply loved - The Girl on the Butterfly Wing said so.  But she also said, \\"you can do no wrong\\"  and that statement alone is startling.Did she mean it is literally impossible to displease God, now that he has entered Heaven?  Or did she mean that from here on out, Dr. Alexander will never displease God?  We aren't given how he interpreted this, but since he repeated her statements again, it must have made a deep impression on him.<br />The hard-core fans of NDE books will likely be disappointed in the lack of detail in Dr. Alexander's account of the universe that he saw, and he says there are \\"many universes.\\"  Yes, it's nice to know that love will be eventually triumphant, but exactly what does that mean?  Dr. Alexander didn't see his father in Heaven, but did have a companion lead him through his experience - someone he didn't even know.  He says there is an abundance of life in the multiple universes, and although he says their intelligence was far advanced beyond humanity, we wonder how he knew that.  By the time you reach the last page, you can't help but feel a little disappointed that all of that infinite wisdom and glory that he says he experienced couldn't be described a little more concretely.  Ah, I guess you had to be there.<br />I do think this book would make a great movie.  There are some very dramatic moments in the emergency room when the doctors learn that one of their own is having uncontrollable seizures, and the final discussion with the Alexander family about letting him go must have been gut-wrenching.  Also, Dr. Alexander's explosion back from the coma is even a little comical.  The other-worldly scenes would be easy for Hollywood (Heaven without religion - now there's a first) and the hero of the story is a true hero, someone who has saved countless lives.  Of course, those who have read the book knows the real identity of the Girl on the Butterfly Wing before the photograph is taken out of the envelope, but it's still a perfect ending.  I have to commend Dr. Alexander for the book's many references to neuroscience, quantum physics, and molecular biology, and I don't doubt that his experience profoundly changed his life.  However, I don't think his book has profoundly changed mine.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|From page one, I could not put this book down.  I was absolutely obsessed and had to know what would happen next.  In the middle, the obsesseion wained a bit, but the book remained a fun read.  I loved the chemistry between the 2 main characters.  What girl doesn't love a bad boy?
B009329ZF2|3.0|OK movie I watched it on a flight from Anchorage to Seattle. Just OK, no big awards for this one. Sci Fi, OK plot, OK animation....just OK.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|It seems a little silly being impressed over something as simple as Breakout, but that's the case here.  The graphics are surprisingly good with a subtle, 3D perspective.  Also, thanks to the nice graphics, the behavior of the power-ups (and power-downs) are obvious, which isn't usually the case with Breakout clones.  The controls work well, with a small strip along the bottom where you can slide your thumb without it getting in the way of the action.  This strip also indicates the currently-active power-ups and your remaining lives.  The animation is nice and fluid.  Even with seven simultaneous balls flying around the screen (thanks to power-ups), the speed and frame rate remained smooth and constant.  Sound effects are adequate and can be disabled directly within the game at any time.<br /><br />In short, this is a great Breakout implementation with excellent graphics, smooth gameplay, and zero permissions.  If you like Breakout, I highly recommend it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|get this game if you want to live. It is so awesome.If you don't buy it you'll regret it.You. will
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The brilliant trilogy begun with FALL OF GIANTS continues.  A new generation, mainly the children of the first book, grows into adulthood and finds the world in an even more intense and brutal battle.  Once again, five families are followed and their lives are changed, either  destroyed or redeemed, by the harrowing events of the late 1930's through early 1950's.<br /><br />A German family, a Welsh family, a British family, a Russian family, and an American family all live through these devastating times, connect and interact in often surprising ways, and in each case work diligently and whole-heartedly for a cause they believe to be right for the world. The social and economic upheaval is overwhelming, the spirit of the families who lived through it undaunted.<br /><br />If you enjoyed FALL OF GIANTS, you will enjoy catching up with familiar and beloved characters, seeing history unfold in a very personal way, and be richly entertained by Ken Follett's brilliant research and well-crafted story telling.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|first CD I have bought in years.  I love this group and the CD is fantastic and I can't believe every song on the CD is great.
B007MDB548|4.0|I pre-ordered Secret of the Wings - my oldest daughter is six and we have all the Tinkerbell films. I'm giving this one four stars - it's very good and fulfilling its main purpose of entertaining my children. Beyond that, the graphics/anmation quality on Blu-Ray are excellent, the story is pretty creative and there are lots of cute/cool fairy moments.<br /><br />I felt this was a good value for the price, considering that you get a Blu-Ray, normal DVD, 3D DVD and a digital copy.<br /><br />My slight beef with this film is that the climax of the story was a little too \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" for me and I could have done without the Dewey character, who shall henceforth be known as the Jar Jar Binks of Disney Fairies.<br /><br />Overall, it's enjoyable and you can watch with the kids without wishing you had imbibed an adult beverage beforehand. I like Tinkberbell and the Lost Treasure the best of all four films, The Great Fairy Rescue the least and I would put Secret of the Wings and the initial Tinkerbell film neck and neck.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i loved this game on the the iphone and now its on kindle fire. How much better can this day get?
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I absolutely love this game, but it has some major issues. The main one is that it keeps closing on me. When I open it back up, the game that I was playing will not finish. It keeps shutting down at the exact same spot. I read in a forum to delete the game and download it again. It worked temporarily. I want to get my friends to play this game, but I can't recommend it when I can't even get it to work right, Also, I have not been able to connect with ANY of my facebook friends to play, so I can only play random strangers.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app the dragonz are sooo cute ( sorry if I'm spelling this wrong :p)  the game iz one I recomend!  you NEED to try this app!!!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Fantastic start, then Reacher goes from a guy who barely talks, to an absolute know it all chatterbox.  Kind of spoiled the ending for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this and I wasn't disappointed.  This book makes me think about how one person in history can change millions of people's lives.  Just one person!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive. its a pity you have to pay real money to get more coins faster, but if you don't want to pay you will reach a max amount of coins every 6-8 hours. still very fun.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Love this story. Did not want the story too end so soon...wanted to be there for the wedding...and the adoption?  Some things left unsaid.
0307454541|4.0|I got this book for my granddaughter as a gift. She read it and enjoyed it which is one for the win column.
076531178X|5.0|This is a great journey where the bad guys are actually the good guys, which I really like. Really awesome main characters with unique skills. This is a must read.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I'm almost finished with the book and have really enjoyed the candor, the intelligent wittiness, and style of writing.  A fun read....bought it again for my adult daughter.
B007STBUHI|5.0|Still scary after all these years.  The quality is great - the color and detail is very much enhanced.  Love it.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|No lie, one of the best movies I've seen in this genre for a long time.  I loved Hot Fuzz for the same reasons.  Great performances all the way down the line.  I've never even heard of Tyler Labine before, but I'll keep my eyes out for more from him.  And so far I've liked everything I've ever seen from Alan Tudyk, and can't say enough about his performance in this.  Katrina Bowden, while a great \\"pretty face\\" was also awesome in this (kudos lady!)  I wish more films like this came out every year.  Great work to you all!
B005WBBYXO|5.0|This is an engaging tale, that keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end. It combines all the elements for a splendid read, the work of a highly creative mind.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Runs great on my phone, graphic are fun (doodle-esque), not sure about sound because I play all my games with the sound off.<br /><br />Best of all: NO PERMISSIONS and NO IAP!<br /><br />Overall, great implementation of a simple concept, high replay value.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Once upon a time Depp would do a masculine role. It seems with every Tim Burton product he becomes even more flamboyant then the last time. Sorry to say this movie was made for fans of queer eye. Burton you crossed the line with this induction of fecal matter into your collection.<br /> It had very few highs, and lower low points through out this utter waste of film. Save yourself the money and watch The nightmare before Christmas, back when entertainment meant something more.<br /> I realized 45 mins in, that this movie had no plot. I actually asked for my money back after it was over. I Felt traumatized, and victimized having sat threw the whole showing. My IQ has just dropped 3 points after viewing this film.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I was lucky to be reading this book while touring London.  I read about English volunteers fighting the Fasists in Spain and later walked down the  street to see a memorial for the same volunteers who died there.  The characters are excellent and learning the historical details is a great bonus!
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|A fascinating journey. It challenges your thinking, beliefs and understanding of the universe. It's a book to read slowly and to read with an open mind. It offers another version of the universe and its not a bad alternative.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Had to keep up with my 15 yr old neice. Worth the read if you have teenagers in the family that are into it...otherwise I would not bother to read it. First book was the best one by far.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is definitely the best remote access solution available for the kindle fire. The setup is incredibly simple and connection is fast and flawless. I highly recommend this.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Wow, what a horrible book! Sorry to the lover of fifty shades but come on! Repetative, mundane, boring, far fetched...yikes...just plain bad!!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I'll admit, after my first listen I was just a little bit disappointed. The only other instances I can recall of this happening with a Donald Fagen or Steely Dan record were with Kamakiriad and Katy Lied. Therefore, this will make it the third time I was slightly disappointed on a first run through. That said, I am NOW officially addicted to this CD. How does he reel me in that way?! Well, as another reviewer put it, it does indeed grow on you and ages like a fine wine. Whether or not you are a Fagen/Steely fan, you should enjoy this fine work of art. Musically and lyrically it's really not too far a stretch from the Steely Dan/Donald Fagen formula true fans have come to know and love. It has pretty much everything you'd come to expect from this musical genius. The clever melodies, intricate jazz chords, the biting and sarcastic lyrics, etc. Once again \\"The Donald\\"  has delivered. At this point, he is in a league of his own with this genre. The only other artist that comes close is Stevie Wonder, but obviously SW tilts more to the R&B side. With DF, it's more pop/r&b/jazz/fusion. This one even has cool cover art! Do yourself a favor. Pick up a copy and enjoy ...
B0087HT36U|4.0|ok game. worth down loading for sure! pretty entertaining. check it out! wont be mad about this down load! enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I've just started  playing the games and it seems pretty interesting so far.  I can't wait to unlock some of the other games. I've read some of the other reviews and I hope it doesnt wipe out all my hard work.  Time will tell.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read most of Steven King's books and have many favorites, this book definitely fits my favorite list.  I think what really pulls people in is the possibility that \\"maybe\\" this could really happen. There is just enough of reality to offset the impossible. I loved it and found myself wondering; if only.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This book was so vulgar that I have deleted it from my Kindle after trying to read half of it.  The writing style is very poor as well. I purchased it by mistake.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I play all the time and then when i run out of coins I leave the game so they can charge back up! There are so many prizes and areas to unlock, it's an exciting game! I highly recommend it! :)
030758836X|1.0|Gillian Flynn duped me with that terrible ending.  Gone Girl was a thrilling page turner, leaving you aching with a need for resolution for the main character, Nick.  I was struck that the book ended so suddenly and with such disappointing results.  No more Gillian Flynn for me.  I could have used my time more productively.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Mythological Fantasy meets Chemistry... Fun app where you cross breed an array of different dragons to hatch new varieties. You can use a little strategy but it's mostly luck when trying to breed for the more rare species. The downside, in my opinion, is the sometimes extremely long wait times when trying to complete any task in the game...whether it be hatching eggs, building habitats or clearing land to expand...unless you are willing to spend gold (which is slow to accumulate or purchased with real money) everything is slow to materialize...some things can take almost two days of waiting to come to fruition.  So if you are an impatient person looking for fast-pace gaming...this app is not for you.  But if you can withstand not watching the clock constantly, this can be pretty enjoyable.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Finally, Scarpetta returns! It was a long wait, but all the familiar characters are involved in a case that surrounds the murder of 2 woman and one missing socialite. I did enjoy this book although I have to say it was not one of my favorites in the series. If you are hooked on Scarpetta, as I am, it is worth the read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg I love minecraft it is the bestest game ever but if it lags badly u need to prepare for your progress to disappear but other wise amazing
B007SSEU9O|1.0|This was a TERRIBLE movie!  Very disappointing.  I did not want to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher in her dotage.  Meryl Streep did a good job of portraying her as the prime minister, but the way the movie presented things was disjointed and I thought that picturing her as a senile old lady was demeaning to the memory of her as a powerful political and historical figure.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I found this book hard to get through. From chapter to chapter, the writer alternates from the present woman with OCD to the woman before she was subjected to the horrors she endured.<br />I found it repetitive, almost as if the writer was experiencing the OCD on a personal level. It takes a long time to get to the last few chapters where things start happening and the story becomes a tense and enjoyable read.<br />I would have preferred a shortened build up to the exciting conclusion.<br />I do have to admit that it all made sense at the end but it was a chore to get there. If I have to question whether I should continue reading then the book is a failure to me. I gave it a 3 because once I finished, I felt it was worth the read. I just can't see spending the full price on this one. It might be worth the time if you find it at a discount price.
0792164903|5.0|I not only got this movie because I'm in love with Johnny depp but I absolutely love Tim burtons dark movie visions. ^_^
B009UX2YAC|2.0|The game is great but, when I bought my coins THREE TIMES, it still did not give me any of the coins.

B004G600A4|2.0|We love Tangled - it's one of our favorites. The negativity in this review is exclusive to the actual DVD that we received in our order from amazon. It was scratched and the movie skips all throughout. Very disappointed.
B009DTHZNE|5.0|I will begin by saying I am a devoted PJ fan, following them almost since the beginning. The Nw music scene has always been highly charged and eclectic, with a variety of sounds that run the gamut. Raining 9 months out of the year leaves folks up here with a gloomy kind of feeling. But bands like Mudhoney,Soundgarden,The Melvin's,Pearl Jam, AIC & Nirvana,as well as Mother Love Bone paved the way for countless bands to follow.They were neither Emo,nor pop or \\"conventional\\" bands...They played loud, fast,and with such incredible feeling that they were really hard to define. They were confessionals,love songs, songs filled with angst, rage,social awkwardness and alienation. And their history is deeply inter-twined with Pearl Jam's. So-and-so was in a band with so-and-so, who knew so-and-so, who was flat-mates with so-and-so.We are treated to an evolutionary tale~ this epic documentary chronicles the scene culminating with the formation of the Band, the evolution of the band and it's members(especially Ed), their rise to stardom (and the interim),and how they have went on to become one of the greatest bands the world has ever known,giving the viewer insight as to why they have a core of devoted fans that follow them with almost Deadhead-like religious fanaticism. Cameron Crowe has a lengthy history with the band, having directed them in \\"Singles\\", also being close friends with them. This Documentary is a must-have for fans, music buffs and historians, who will appreciate a behind-the-scenes look into a complex, yet down-to-Earth bunch of guys whose love of music and their fans has transcended time, and who are passionate about not only these things, but social and environmental causes as well. 2 decades is a long time in the music industry, but they have found their niche, and continue to wow and amaze, while seemingly to never miss a beat.Highly recommended,highly informative,and highly appreciated.
B00005614N|5.0|If I could give this cd more than 5 stars I would. It is absolutely amazing, and I love Louis (the more I listen to him the more I want to hear more), and Duke is an artist I am learning more about as well and would also love to hear more.  Obviously, 2 masters having fun and it makes me smile every time I listen to them on this cd.  I would recommend this cd to any new or old jazz fan!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|It's such a joy to stumble over such a wonderful book - the 500+ other 5 star reviews are all well deserved.  One of the best fantasy novels I've read this year.  Buy it, read it, enjoy it.
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|It's funny, being an American living in Canada, how my two newest and favorite piano players are Canadian; Oscar Peterson and Glenn Gould.  I find anything Oscar Peterson does amazing, along with his jazz trio.  Of course, I have yet to really delve into that other great jazz piano player, Art Tatum, so will reserve my final decision as to who is my favorite of all time until that time as some say Art is the best of the best.  Suffice to say, this album is a treat and delight to listen to from beginning to end, and am also a new fan of Clark Terry.  Anyone who is joined by, or joins with, the Oscar Peterson Trio has they're game lifted to another stratosphere.  Yes, this is one to add to your collection if you're like me, a relative newcomer to the jazz scene.  I always feel like I'm preaching to the choir in my reviews as I'm just getting into jazz, although I've listened before and know certain names.  Oh well, enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  Well written, and captivating!  Please hurry with the third book Ms. Day...Can't wait to see what happens !!!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This game is very similar to the classic game of \\"Pong,\\" or a pinball machine. It's a lot like Pong on Steroids!  But the game has been updated, and a lot of extras have been added.  Here are some things I like:<br /><br />1. The action is fast.<br /><br />2. There are a lot of things going on at one time.<br /><br />3. Instead of the standard white ball blipping around the screen, you have a rainbow of colors filling the screen.<br /><br />4.  The ball changes colors based on the last block it wiped off of the screen.<br /><br />5.  You can rack up points by capturing falling objects that are frozen inside of the blocks, and that are released when you hit the block.<br /><br />6.  You can score extra balls and have multiple balls in play at the same time, which is very interesting when they are moving at different speeds and at different angles.<br /><br />7. The balls also leave \\"misty\\" trails on the screen, showing where they came from.  It's a lot like airplane contrails, and helps you to learn the physics concepts of how the balls are moving around the screen so you can get better, faster.<br /><br />8. I love the nod the game provides to Sir Isaac Newton and his falling apples, and almost 350 years later, the apples are still falling.<br /><br />9. Playing the game brought back memories of friendly conversations started over the Pong table console. But I'm saving a truckload of quarters by playing the game on my Kindle.<br /><br />10. It's a lot of fun!  Enjoy!
B009KHCT94|4.0|I knew what to expected when watching this movie. I remember reading about it in Wired some time ago and the early teasers of the movie. Pretty good production value for not being a Hollywood movie and a story on par or better compared to what comes out from Hollywood these days. The story is far fetched and what if concept dealing with the Nazi's. But the story is still believable in the sci-fiction sense. I enjoyed it and got a few laughs. The president was great, like Sara Palin, but not saying she was. The end was not expected, although I had no end in mind as far as how it should have. I actually watched it twice, once with the girl a second with me dad. If you know the story of this film and know what to expect, I would recommend this movie.

B00007KQA3|5.0|First of all thanks to the seller for an excellent product and service. I have always<br />been a fan of the book and film(s). I saw this version in 1984 when it was first released.<br />I'm glad I waited for the DVD. I've seen this item sell for many times the price.<br />Much of this story has rung true over the years since its writing. I can write all day<br />about this film but anyone interested can find all they need to know on the Internet.<br />My thanks again to the seller.  Tom Schenk.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|Disappointing that the character development could not exceed the cliche! Somehow the scientists of the future are habitually unprepared and ignorant of scientific process.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I simply don't understand why some authors feel compelled to use so much profanity in their novels. An otherwise good plot is ruined by the constant cursing. I don't know any people who talk like that. The author and I must run in totally different circles. They always say that they want it to be authentic and realistic. Well, it is only disgusting.<br />The plot was great with all kinds of unexpected turns. I kept turning the pages even though I hated the language.
1423140605|5.0|I believe that this is one of the best book in the Heroes of Olympus series, it has all you could ask for: breath taking fight scenes, awesome plot and finally one of the best ending i could ask for.<br />If you like books then you have to buy this one

B005S9ELM6|5.0|Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers ([[ASIN:B0000DKDUT Gigli]], [[ASIN:B0006JMLPM Surviving Christmas]]), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director ([[ASIN:B006RXPUR2 Gone Baby Gone]], [[ASIN:B004CEUEWE The Town]]) is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first-timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the \\"best bad idea\\" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.<br /><br />The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit of [[ASIN:B0053EZT4U Battle For The Planet Of The Apes]] to come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy.<br /><br />This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts - John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary-style of Rodrigo Prieto's ([[ASIN:B000ICXQS8 Brokeback Mountain]]) cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan.

B004V5A7K8|4.0|The game may look like a amateurish game on the surface its actually well done. I actually found myself liking it. No permissions at all, basic sound, and decent graphics with some neat game play elements. There are probably better breakout games but this is a good contender to keep on your device.
0399157565|1.0|Scarpetta has become the person I love to hate in her last few books.  I almost wished she would have died while diving to recover the dead body.  She is condescending, arrogant, judgemental and completely unlikeable.  I'd hate to work for someone like her.  Wonder if Patricia Cornwell is the same type of person, since it is said that a writer's personality creeps into his/her work.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|\\"In Treatment\\" has one of the simplest but most powerful premises for any TV series in history: various therapy patients come to the home office of Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) and lay bare their souls. \\"In Treatment\\" creator Rodrigo Garcia--adapting a series that originally appeared on Israeli TV--has assembled a fascinating group of characters. They include Alex (Blair Underwood), a hotshot Navy pilot beset by feelings of guilt and inadequacy; Sophie (Mia Wasikowska), a suicidal teenage gymnast; Jake (Josh Charles) and Amy (Embeth Davidtz), a mismatched married couple on the brink of divorce; and--most disturbing for Dr. Weston--Laura (Melissa George), a sexually confused doctor with an obsessive crush on Dr. Weston.<br /><br />As the series progresses, we see that Dr. Weston himself is not without problems, and definitely not without character flaws that would be much improved by therapy. He is chilly and demanding toward Kate (Michelle Forbes), his increasingly fed-up wife, and he also has issues with Gina Toll (Dianne Wiest), his own therapist and former mentor.<br /><br />The 43 episodes are extremely brief (the average length is about 25 minutes, but some are as short as 20), concentrated, and brilliantly written, often leaving viewers gasping for air. But it is the performances that really carry \\"In Treatment\\" and make it a must-see program. Every actor on the show deserves to be singled out for praise; however, I will say that Byrne is rock-solid as the show's anchor, and Wasikowska clearly reveals herself to be one of the finest actors of her generation. \\"In Treatment\\" isn't exactly cheerful viewing, but it will leave you totally fascinated.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This is the first time I have been compelled to write an online review of a movie. But this movie is such a piece of trash that I just have to say something. I am a great \\"Blade Runner\\" fan and also liked the first couple \\"Alien(s).\\" But while watching this movie, I kept thinking: \\"It can't be this bad...\\" but it was. And then I thought, \\"It's got to get better.\\" But it never did. This movie is a nonsensical mess that isn't even consistent with itself. The plot holes are numerous and astounding. The story doesn't work on any level. The cliche's just keep piling up and actually get worse the further one gets into the movie. The characters are idiotic and unbelievable and behave in ways that are contrary to their disciplines, their self-interest or the interest of the crew / mission or even their own safety. Frankly, this film is preposterous...not always a cardinal sin for sci-fi, but preposterous expensive trash is. The best 30 seconds of this movie are the clip from \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" If you are a sci-fi fan or a Ridley Scott fan, save yourself some agony and avoid this movie (like the plague :).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun!! It is so so so so addictive!!! Just like the arcade game!! I can't stop playing!!!! Pretty good graphics.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|A tremendous story with many twists and turns, leaving you breathless & unable to put it down.  I was able to visualise the locations having been to the Isle of Lewis a few years back that just added to feel of the book.  The characters were great, very believable & I can't wait to read the next book.
0385344333|1.0|This was a terrible book.  Extremely repetitive, boring and at times nonsensical.  If anyone is curious about the NONSENSE of the book, take a look at page 67.  What the heck is the author blithering on about?  There are so many stupid pages like that!  And now there is finally a 6' 5&#34; Reacher movie coming out right before Christmas!!<br />Starring, wait for it, 5' 7&#34; Tom Cruise of Oprah couch jumping fame!  Lee Child has been phoning it in for his last couple of books and now &#34;HOLLYWOOOOD&#34; is ready to take it from there.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|....to describe this movie, it would be...... Magnificent has a nice ring to it.<br /><br />Twas a great meshing of all the Avenger characters. Mostly all action with very few slow spots. I can't wait for the sequel to it and the several other franchise movies.
030758836X|2.0|I was a little disappointed in Gone Girl. I found it hard to really like either main character as both were phony from the beginning, but the ending really did it for me. I probably won't read either of Gillian Flynn's other books. The reviews read better than the book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great read.  I was captured by this story as a parent of an only child.  The struggles reading a teenager and this conflict between a husband and wife.  I couldn't get enough.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|If I've learned to expect one thing from Lauren Oliver, it's unbearable cliffhangers! When you read Pandemonium I can almost guarantee you, like me, will end up begging for the next book!<br /><br />Pandemonium was a slow start for me. At the beginning I felt that it just didn't compare to the first book. Boy did I change my mind during the second half!! Just as Delirium was emotion filled, Pandemonium certainly had its moments as well. There were a few particular scenes that I struggled with... If you've read this you probably have an idea of what I'm talking about. The story wasn't completely focused on emotion, however. There was plenty of action to keep me satisfied as well, even more so than the first book.<br /><br />Many new characters were introduced into Lena's story. The character I found most intriguing, like many others, was Julian. I loved the contrast between the two: how each of them came from different backgrounds but managed to work together. I loved watching the suspicion between them melt away as they learned to trust one another!<br /><br />I enjoyed Pandemonium just as much, if not better, than Delirium. The characters, action, and turn filled plot left me begging for more. As I mentioned earlier, be prepared for yet another cliffhanger! Yes, I am still recovering from it! Be sure to check out the Delirium series: Delirium, Pandemonium, and Requiem (coming March 2013)!

B009715OAO|3.0|Not sure what Dusty Kid (Lost Her Love Remix) and Andrew Dawson (Happysad Remix) were aiming for here, but these are not club oriented remixes.<br />It makes you wonder if Neil & Chris ever authorized either of these mixes before the release. To me, the cover art is Neil's expression the first time he heard the Lost Her Love Mix. Andrew Dawson's mix stays pretty close to the original album mix, as does the demo mix. This one is strictly for the hardcore Pet Shop Boy fan, and not a CD that DJ's will want to use in a club setting.

I don't know why I bought this, but due to Amazon's clever marketing/packaging I got to watch the video on Amazon Instant Video first.  Now this video is becoming a Christmas present for one of my nieces.<br /><br />It was a pretty good movie, and the title made it sound like an interesting twist on a familiar faerie tale.  But I didn't think it was all that great.  I'm just not into faerie tales.  I thought it was appropriately acted, and the design/cinematography/cgi were all good, just not compelling.<br /><br />Just sayin......
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a fun ride through history!  I felt it did not drag at all. Books are like people. Sometimes you click with them, sometimes you don't. It often relates to the time in your life.

I was so annoyed with the \\"1 click buy\\", but figured I might as well watch it anyway since I had just paid for it. This behind the scenes \\"Zombie Studio\\" was like 3 minutes long. For $3.

1451695195|1.0|OK, this is the first time I have reviewed anything!  If you are already a beleiver in God and Heaven, no reason to read this book...I found it to be a difficult read, and certainly not uplifting compared to other NDE books I have read.  Embraced by the Light, 90 Minutes in Heaven, Heaven is for Real - all very uplifting, enjoyable books.  The only people I think might enjoy this book are very intelligent, scientific, sceptics.  It reads more like a medical textbook than an inspirational book.  I purchased 12 for many close friends and family members who have lost close loved ones this year, I am returning all but the copy I read.  Apparently, I am one who does not need the \\"proof.\\"
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple run is pretty good ang really fun but it just gets really boring if play it non stop for a week then you will be sick of it. But in that period of time it is a pretty fun game!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's an entertaining book, no great literature,  that you'll remember. Men should read this, so that they will learn good ideas. Careful not to learn sick ideas.  Good and very descriptive sex scenes, erotic scenes. That's it.
B009VB97EY|4.0|So I watched it once and tried to follow the \\"storyline\\" (did you know there is somewhat of one in there?!) and wasn't impressed but I decided to watch it again the next day and just skip past all that unnecessary talking crap and actually liked it a LOT more! (Did you know there are anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour of useless \\"talking\\" mixed up with the eye candy?!!!). My fave was Big Di...err Joe Manganiello and while there was much to see of him he wasn't on screen for long enough but Channing's dancing was worth stopping for.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read these books to see what everyone was talking about. Repetitive, boring, trite. This kid at age fifteen enters into this dominant-submissive relationship for 5 years. Now at age 20 he ends said relationship and she gives him 100,000 dollars. He goes from being a submissive to dominant immediately. Has all these submissive women in 5 years, learns to fly planes and helicopters, as well as sail. The whole time he is doing all these things he also amasses an incredible fortune. This story had to have been written by an eighth grader. I kept hoping they would both crash in the helicopter and put the characters out of their misery.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This game of breakout offers many twists and changes that makes the original game great.  Really enjoyed playing this game.  Highly recommend the game to players that would like a simple, fun game.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Fun read lee child has a great imagination and leaves you guessing how he will get out of his sitiation
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I am on the third book in the series and I don't know if I will ever finish it. Seriously this reads like a dime store novel!! It really wasn't that interesting and wish I hadn't bought them,but everyone was saying how good these books were I thought I'd give them a try. The author really could of put all three books into one.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really thought that this was a kids book but I ended up enjoying it. Would recommend for all ages.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book and all it's twists and turns! I wish the ending was a bit more cohesive. I am guessing the writer wanted to leave the door open for a sequel.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you are a John Corey fan you won't be disappointed. Politically incorrect  with the ability to say what you're thinking. Great read to lose a couple days with. Keep it coming Nelson. It was also nice to see the reemergence of Paul Brenner.
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun little time sink, plenty of depth, controls are as accurate as your fingers and works nicely on the galaxy s3.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This is a very warm-hearted and delightfully charming movie that's filled with individual lovely stories about the characters who are all searching for \\"something more in their golden years\\", and have selected the \\"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" only to find there's more to life in India, and maybe something special that life has to offer them and those their lives are intertwined with and touched by! Rent it and choose for yourself if it's one to add to your video collection! I recommend, \\"buy it\\"!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. Evey day when I get home I have to play this game. It lets you build your own world the way you want it to be.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you cant beat a free solitaire app.  i love that i can change card backs as well as the table.
6305014140|3.0|I know this is an older anime and considered somewhat of a classic, which is why I checked it out.  In my humble opinion, the story wasn't all that interesting here.  I'm not saying it was bad, but it didnt have me on the edge of my seat or anything.  I will say there are a number of really cool scenes that I enjoyed; mostly the bloody ones.  And the fact that the female ninja can kill any man by sleeping with them is an interesting premise.  She doesn't even need to ask, as most would be more than willing to rape her, ultimately benefiting... her?  Kinda twisted huh.  I'm glad to have Ninja Scroll in my collection now, but anything over 90 minutes would have been too much.  I would be interested to check out the Blu-Ray which is being released soon and see the improvement of quality as this looks pretty dated.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is fantastic I liked the amazing details. I recommend this to thrill seekers. This book is really awesome!
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|the acting is alright.  the effects are absolutely average and look like some 9th grade computer class created them.  the movie made soooooo many cuts from the book that it doesnt flow well at all.  as a huge fan of the book, i am really diappointed with this film.  lets hope the next film will have some decent special effects and stick more to the book.
B0094OLJD0|1.0|This was listening to an entire cd worth of off key, out of tune nonsense. Nothing seemed correctly put together, like everything is just a little messed up, with vocals a little too weak and quiet compared to the music. It literally gave me a headache.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game until it started booting me off everytime  I go to the store(in the game). So I figured I would uninstall it and try it again. well now I can install it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm bored and want to say hi to me because I luv me tehehehe so ya and bannanas r cool and cool bug I like this game
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I enjoyed this season very much. I'm looking forward to season 3. I love the ending. Very smart and funny show.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Not the typical books I read... Loved it. It was different!! Good depiction of a 19 year old girl who was very smart but emotionally stupid at the same time!! I would read it again! I'm in love with Travis!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I can always count on DeMille for a great story, interesting characters and a wonderful way of mixing suspense with bits of humor.  Always a sure bet with me!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Awesome book. Bought entire series.  Kind of book series I will read over & over again for my entire life. Great t.v. show as well..
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This reminds me of the very first block game that we had on our very first computer. I loved it then, and I love it now.
B0087ITC9C|5.0|Honestly, I don't know how Robery Zemeckis has stayed away from live action films for this long. After directing three animated films, Robert Zemeckis is back and directing a brilliant new film called Flight. This film shows some of Denzel Washington's best work in years and it would be a surprise if he wasn't nominated for Best Actor at this point. Flight is the story of an alcohol-fueled airplane pilot who saves 96 out of 102 people when their plane starts falling apart at 30,000 feet. The crash sequence is absolutely riveting and sets the tone for this great movie. I won't give away any spoilers so I'll just say that Denzel is on fire and Robert Zemeckis makes his best film since Cast Away.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I'm not sure if my opinion will be helpful to a larger scale of people, but to those who enjoy Three Days Grace, I'd definitely recommend supporting them and buying their new album! I love it! I have always loved Three Days Grace so I pre-ordered the album before it was even released and know all the words to all the songs now! TDG FOR LIFE!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun for all ages!!!!!! I enjoy playing and so does my young daughter.It's like a good book it's hard to put down.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Torn between 4 and 5 stars, Samsung galaxy SII finger control bounce bar lags- takes away a funness star. The serious lack of permission actually redeems a star. Love the retro /new tech mix
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game.  I couldn't remember what all the extras did so experimented a lot.  I eventually went to the internet and found out about using the amulet.  That allowed me to complete the harder levels and triumph over the game rather than going mad.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is the best game ever! :-)! Please play this game I beg of you. Its incrediable. So listen to the advise (PLAY IT).
B0090SVDO0|5.0|Much better than I expected.  Pure magic.  The recording quality for 1968 is excellent.  Jim Morrison and the band are on their game.  I love the live Doors recordings.  So  glad I have this, it will be listened too many times over late at night with all the lights off.  This one is special!
B0063IH60K|5.0|a great game with lots of testing rounds and very useful tips if you get stuck too! Unfinished games are saved which is very helpful. I love it!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have instagram, and wanted to mess up my friends faces, just to get a laugh, and this was perfect. everyone has to have this or they will crawl in the corner, shovel up and DIE!!!!!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Hours of fun! Challenging but not impossible.  The Hint button is a great tool for guidance.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B000JIHP88|5.0|This mobile is hands down one of the top 5 BEST baby purchases I made! My son loves it so much that when the mobile stops spinning, baby just stares at it and starts crying for it to come back on again. It really has allowed him to enjoy his crib, and his room for a looong while.  Perfect in the morning when I need to get myself ready and he's got morning energy to expend. What makes this mobile so indispensable in our home:<br />- Batteries last a long time and we use this several times a day!<br />- The toys are very colorful and face down so when baby is lying in crib looking up, it's like they are dancing for him.<br />- 3 music / 1 rainforest noise options are all great and provide good change of pace for baby.<br />- the leaves open and close while the toys spin making this very 'interactive' and holds baby's attention for a looong time.<br />- The music and entertainment last a very long time (maybe 45 min? - I lose track of time while he's in his crib and it feels like hours :-) of 'free' time so I can get other things done<br />- Sometimes we get to add our own animal soundtrack as the animals spin and baby looves that too!<br />- Nightlight is a special touch!  Now, I've only turned on the nightlight several times when I was desperate to calm him down in his crib at bedtime and nothing else worked. He was mesmerized when he saw the light! So I use it as a treat. Eventually when (and if) he tires of the mobile, we will use the nightlight more. But it's great to have this added option to extend the life of the product.<br /><br />One challenge: the leaves and the spinning can get stuck after a few months of play. We opened one up and the inside parts are made of plastic. It looked like the lubricant used to make the gears run smoothly were dried up. So adding more lube will get this back to normal. It's a little tough to put back together and takes patience. But what a worth-it product!!!!!
0545265355|4.0|I got the series and read it nonstop. It's an easy read. Couldn't put it down. Glad I bought it!
B003O86FMW|2.0|The second book of the Hunger games left too many questions unanswered, details dont add up, and the book seemed unusually short.  First book-great, this one- ho-hum.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom was a very entertaining movie with quite a cast.  The humor in my opinion was sometimes hidden but that's one of the things that made it a better movie.  The plot will bring you back to thinking the way you thought as a kid and without spoiling anything in the movie, this also added to the value of making it a video to watch over again.<br /><br />One of my criteria for a good film is if I would watch it over again and I definitely would with this video.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Like many of us, I'm hooked on the story and characters in this series. I read many reviews by others which had me hesitating to buy, but I am not disapointed with my purchase. I admit that it is a little different to have the timeline of books 4 and 5 be essentially the same, but once I adjusted to this fact, the read was very enjoyable.  Perhaps combining the books and releasing two volumes with sequential timelines would have been a bit less confusing, but I am not the author...just a fan who wants to read more. If you have been hesitating to buy this because of bad reviews, you may be missing out on more good reading from an author we've all grown to enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The erotic scenes were interesting, but unfortunately the framework they sit in was very dull and uninteresting.  The story needed to be more believable to make it real for the reader.  It was hard not to constantly be aware that this was just so unlikely to happen. Maybe her next book might have more sophistication to overcome this basic flaw
B004GXAZL6|3.0|Not many surprises in this one. The plot was interesting but became transparent too easily. Definetly did not excite as other Camel Clubs have.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE .. LOVED THE HULK !! ALL THE HEROES TOGETHER .. ACTION PACKED .. GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS ! I WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN !!
030759565X|5.0|A note: I have had to revise my review up from 4 to 5 stars despite the lack of a soup/stew section because I've now had a chance to make a few things and they've all been total knockouts, especially the pot pie and the roasted chicken with potatoes. I am extra impressed because it's pot pie and roast chicken, some of the most basic and perhaps unexciting dishes, and in both cases I tasted them and said OH MY GOD and wrote to my partner to warn him to get home fast or he wouldn't get any. Today I came home and found he had left the book peppered with bookmarks, numbered in order of what he wants next. If that doesn't get you 5 stars I don't know what can, soup or no soup! The full text of my original review is below:<br />___<br />The good stuff: The book's organization seems to reflect a real home cook's interests and needs. It's organized into breakfast, salads, sandwiches/tarts/pizzas, veggie mains, meat mains, sweets, and party snacks/drinks. This is a little different from other cookbooks I've seen, and it's great and practical. It reflects the great strength of bloggers: the Q&A with real home cooks who ask the kinds of questions that might seem obvious or naive to a pro, but that can make a real difference to your everyday cooking -- like, what difference will I see in my dish if I use salt X vs salt Y? \\"What will happen if...\\" is the number one question you have when you're cooking, right? Because you have frozen corn, not fresh, or you have dried herbs, not fresh, or whatever other little substitutions you'd like to make, and you want some guidance till you get the hang of it. This book does a great job of addressing those kinds of questions, and presents the recipes with very appetizing photos.<br /><br />Do you see what's missing, though? Where are the soups/stews? They're not in the main categories, and they're not in the index, either. I found that a bit disappointing and indeed a bit odd. It seems like flavorful, hearty, one-pot dishes would be squarely in this writer's wheelhouse.<br /><br />This is just a matter of personal preference, but I did not find the idea of spaghetti squash in tacos or popcorn in cookies appealing. I do read the blog and cook from it pretty frequently, so I think this is just a matter of no two individuals having quite the same taste, and unfortunately for me, the areas where I don't overlap with the author made it into the cookbook kind of disproportionately. I can't ding it for that, but am just noting it here so you can check it out for yourself.
B000MV9026|4.0|This I purchased for a friend who by accident ordered it in the wrong format, I took what she had and replaced it with this one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing! Loved it from beginning to end. Took me on all kinds of emotional journeys, and left me wanting more. Couldn't put it down! Highly recommend this to anyone who loves to hear a beautiful story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i could it for hours it s way better than temple run.  its more fun because its interesting
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the Fifty Shades trigoly!!!!! I know everyone is gaga over the steamy &#34;adult&#34; scenes (and they are good) but nobody is talking about the wonderful storyline. Fifty shades had everything....it made me laugh, it made me cry (many, many times), it had me on the edge of my seat. It was very hard to put this book down. It is a must read.
0316212377|4.0|I wish I could give this one 3.5 stars but I'll be generous. I loved the characters. The dialogue sparkled with wit and trenchant observations on life and the Universe. The problem here is the story: there just isn't enough of it.<br /><br />The Gzilt, an ancient race, with technology roughly equivalent to the Culture, is about to Sublime. The Gzilt have a bible, the \\"Book of Truth,\\" which unlike the bible of any other known race, has correctly predicted scientific development into the future. A few weeks before they are due to Sublime, a remnant ship of an even more ancient race appears and reveals that the Book of Truth was an elaborate joke (or perhaps experiment) played on the Gzilt. Factions within the Gzilt resort to violence to keep this a secret, fearing that the news could somehow induce their society to change its collective mind regarding Subliming, and the Culture gets involved, trying to figure out what's going on.<br /><br />The problem here is that the Gzilt, while regarding the Book of Truth with some pride, don't really care. Their society has long since abandoned formal religion and the entire issue is basically academic. The response to the revelation makes little sense. Perhaps this is the author's intention, since the principal bad guy is at least borderline insane, but in the end, it's much ado about nothing. (Spoiler alert!). The Gzilt go ahead and Sublime. The Culture, having figured it all out, decide to keep the whole plot a secret and the closest thing the book has to a protagonist decides not to Sublime (at least not yet) for reasons that are left unclear. Maybe she'll join the Culture. Maybe she'll go on a trip. Maybe she will continue to play her music, which has been her main pre-occupation for most of her adult life. None of these are bad choices and since the whole plot resulted in no real change either to the main characters or the Universe at large, I am left with a feeling of anti-climax. The whole ending was a great big \\"So What?\\"
034580404X|5.0|A must read! Damn I love this book. Exciting, fun, sexy and sweet! Can't help imagining it on a big screen!!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Great movie with catchy musical renditions. Both children and adults love this movie. The nightmare before Christmas is a classic and sure to be around for generations.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was such a great book. I was surprised to learn this was a first novel, bravo Vanessa! The character was well developed and the focus of flowers and foster care was interesting.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game I played it every second. then all of a sudden all my progress just went away and I had to start over
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Yes, she ventures into acoustic rock/folk Norah Jones territory in a few of these songs---there are suddenly guitars and drums mixed in with her vocals in about 1/3 to 1/2 of the tracks, but it's still her wonderfully husky, sensual voice and best of all: praise Jeebus, no more FRIGGIN' LARWENCE WELK orchestral treatments!<br /><br />There are still quite a few refreshingly simple vocals-and-piano tracks which are always a pleasure, though not quite the jazz trio blockbusters of 1997's \\"Love Songs\\" which remains probably her best CD.<br /><br />For all you grumpy, stick-in-the-mud jazz purists out there, good chunks of this album should still leave you smiling...just lighten up, will ya?<br /><br />as of 11/6/2012, this review has received 10 unhelpful votes...ROTFL!  My my, I never knew that there were so many grumpy little jazz-traditionalists running around Amazon.  Get a life, people...snort!
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|If you enjoy Post Rock, this is THE album to get.  From start to finish this album is excellent.  They are masters of building layers of sounds and atmosphere that reach triumphant explosions in music.  If you do not own any of their other albums, this is an excellent place to start.  Highly recommended!
B009IJJ712|5.0|This a terrific new show.  The two lead actors are very good and the writing is excellent.  Quickly becoming my favorite show on TV.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is my third book by this author.  I enjoyed it immensely, but I'm not sure whether I would have enjoyed it as much (or perhaps even finished it), had I not developed some previous acquaintance with the author's style.  Given the length alone, the challenge might have been too great.<br />To state the obvious, Murakami is a master story-teller.  His ability to conjure up and fully flesh out characters is one of the keys to his effectiveness.  However, he is also quite skilled and articulate at advancing a plot through numerous and perambulating developments without once losing the reader (or at least the reader's interest to investigate further).  Also, his use of language is what makes his writing so engaging (captivating, really).  There is an economy to his use of language.  It is very descriptive, while seldom becoming ponderous.<br />With specific regard to 1Q84, this story has it all in terms of the aspects of the human psyche that, in the aggregate, we call the human condition. Central elements include religion, childhood, isolation, despair, hope, the quest for meaning and redemption. The fact that these elements are played out against the backdrop of an alternate universe might initially suggest to one that this is a work of science fiction. However, it ultimately emerges that this is a plot device that allows the author, through the characters, to explore the themes of reality, time, logic and meaning.<br />In summary, I found this a very rewarding book to read and I will remember it and its characters for a very long time.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|wow! i just read this book and i have to admit that it was amazing. the only problem is that in every one of these heroes of olympus books, the story ends right where something really important happens. totally worth reading though. i cant wait for the house of hades to come out!
B006CTZ2G0|4.0|This review is a review of the AKG K240Ss and the CAD MH310s (I cant speak for the Behringer HA400... but its probably decent)<br /><br />So I own these AKG K240Ss and the CAD MH310s.  I wanted to compare them for your sake, because bother are AMAZING cans, and both worth more than their prices (I've bought plenty of cans in the past).  Long Story short, the AKGs stand their ground as classics and the CADs bring some seriously cool characteristics as competition.  (buy both lol)<br /><br />Radiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (non-amped)<br />AKG: Very neutral, almost completely flat at times.  HUGE sound stage.  Lack of directness and isolation, but it feels like you're there live.  Sounds can sound almost as though they are mechanically created they are so real.<br />CAD:  Direct, Isolated, Focused.  Bass is heavy, Treble is bright, you couldn't configure an EQ any more suited to the average listener.<br />Conclusion:  CADs were fun, but you could listen to the AKGs forever and love every second.<br />Winner: AKG<br /><br />Radiohead: Kid A: Idioteque (amped)<br />AKG: Still neutral, but with a bit more punch.  Bass hits are more presence (still not as much as the CAD) and highs have a unique  soft ringing quality.<br />CAD:  Bass really thumps and the highs shine even more.  There is no way to add more sound stage though, just more of the same (which isn't a bad thing depending on your tastes).  Vocals sounded almost too close to the ear.<br />Conclusion:  CADs had tons of power but the AKGs were the same terrific cans as before (non-amped) with more punch and presence.<br />Winner: AKG<br /><br />NIN: Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (non-amped)<br />AKG:  Huge sound stage.  Sounds are soft, and at all distances while Trent's vocals are surprisingly present.  Again, certain sounds have the sharpness and craft to appear almost mechanical and not produced by a speaker.<br />CAD:  Sounds are much sharper and direct.  The bass and treble of the CADs really help in this track, the sound is just... fun.  The quick bursts of silence made a huge impact in contrast with the sharp extremes.<br />Consclusion:  The CADs just added the punch and frequency dynamics that made the track.  The AGK's sounded live and open.<br />Winner: CAD<br /><br />NIN Pretty Hate Machine: That's What I Get (amped)<br />AKG:  The softness is gone, and AKGs openness and accuracy portrays perfectly this track's abrupt highs and almost mechanical lows (no longer soft, but quite detailed).  Quick silent parts are contrasted with fast paced, abrupt changes.<br />CAD:  They're loud and direct to a fault, you will not miss a moment.  Bass is big and brooding, but the highs lack the snap that the AKGs had.  Sounds move around quickly on these cans, but always within close proximity.<br />Conclusion:  The CADs sound powerful and amazing, but you will never forget the hugeness of the AKGs and their absolute authority on this track.<br />Winner:  AKG<br /><br />The Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (un-amped)<br />AKG:  The sound is almost smothering yet without appearing too close... the male and female vocals take the stage and fill your ears beautifully.  Sound stage sounds perfect.<br />CAD:  Very clear sounding and extremely close proximity.  Sound stage is bigger than usual, but not comparable to the AKG.  Vocals are even more present, and very clear and precise.<br />Conclusion:  The AKGs are extremely open and lively, while the CADs are a bit too close but amazingly precise.<br />Winner: AKG<br /><br />The Dolly Rocker Movement: Our Days Mind The Time: Coffin Love (amped)<br />AKG:  Blissful openness and naturalness, with tremendous kick and clarity added in.  The AKGs are carry vocal detail and characteristics extremely well here.  Guitar is very pronounced now.<br />CAD:  Almost overwhelming in its up front characteristics (feels like the singers are two feet from your face).  Like the AKGs, the guitar is also very pronounced now too.Very amusing listen, but very taxing.<br />Conclusion:  The CADs sound amazingly up close while the AKGs sound like you're there.<br />Winner:  Tie<br /><br />Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br />AKG:  A very relaxed take on an EBM sound.  Sounds are a bit further than normal, although everything is very present and articulate.<br />CAD:  Bass and treble have more authority than before.  Sounds are very present and extremely detailed and textured.  For once, sounds almost mechanically produced on the CADs as opposed to the AKGs.<br />Conclusion:  The AKGs have a distant/softer approach to this track.  The CADs are powerful and in charge.<br />Winner: CAD<br /><br />Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br />AKG:  The softness is gone and it is AKG's signature soundstage coupled with snappy highs and lows which hit hard.  Sounds are extremely detailed and easy to identify and understand.<br />CAD:  Thumping, authoritative sound.  Right in your face (or your ears) sound with all the bass authority and treble clarity you could want.<br />Conclusion: The CADs are extremely strong and in charge.  The AKGs are wide open yet precise and very snappy.<br />Winner:  Tie<br /><br />Let me just say that neither of these cans are a bad deal by any means.  Let me also say that neither one is better than the other.  In fact, I say, own both, they complement each other extremely well.  If you have to chose one or the other, just keep in mind, AKG = huge sound stage, CAD = powerful and direct.  I will say the CADs are immensely fun and the AKGs are blissful to listen to for long times; and both benefit from an amp (even a cheappo - tried many).  Choose what suits your tastes (or get both).<br />If you want headphones for: rap, hiphop, industrial, ebm, electronic, etc... choose the CAD<br />If you want headphones for: new age, rock, alternative, classic, psychedelic, etc... choose the AKG<br /><br />-but really that's not true... its really sound stage over directness... choose your flavor!Very amusing listen, but very taxing.<br />Conclusion:  The CADs sound amazingly up close while the AKGs sound like you're there.<br />Winner:  Tie<br /><br />Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br />AKG:  A very relaxed take on an EBM sound.  Sounds are a bit further than normal, although everything is very present and articulate.<br />CAD:  Bass and treble have more authority than before.  Sounds are very present and extremely detailed and textured.  For once, sounds almost mechanically produced on the CADs as opposed to the AKGs.<br />Conclusion:  The AKGs have a distant/softer approach to this track.  The CADs are powerful and in charge.<br />Winner: CAD<br /><br />Front 242: Front By Front: Terminal State (un-amped)<br />AKG:  The softness is gone and it is AKG's signature soundstage coupled with snappy highs and lows which hit hard.  Sounds are extremely detailed and easy to identify and understand.<br />CAD:  Thumping, authoritative sound.  Right in your face (or your ears) sound with all the bass authority and treble clarity you could want.<br />Conclusion: The CADs are extremely strong and in charge.  The AKGs are wide open yet precise and very snappy.<br />Winner:  Tie<br /><br />Let me just say that neither of these cans are a bad deal by any means.  Let me also say that neither one is better than the other.  In fact, I say, own both, they complement each other extremely well.  If you have to chose one or the other, just keep in mind, AKG = huge sound stage, CAD = powerful and direct.  I will say the CADs are immensely fun and the AKGs are blissful to listen to for long times; and both benefit from an amp (even a cheappo - tried many).  Choose what suits your tastes (or get both).<br />If you want headphones for: rap, hiphop, industrial, ebm, electronic, etc... choose the CAD<br />If you want headphones for: new age, rock, alternative, classic, psychedelic, etc... choose the AKG<br /><br />-but really that's not true... its really soundstage over directness... choose your flavor!

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Thanks to Amazon reviewers, I picked this book.  I enjoyed the story line.  I love books that makes me think, and calls to me.  Pines did that for me.  I will read more by this author.  I definitely recommend this book!!
0812973992|5.0|A masterfully-crafted novel in which a host of characters are linked through an association (sometimes direct, sometime ephemeral) with the wire-walker who walked between the two towers of the (former) World Trade Center.<br />In a lesser author's hands, this could have made for a gimmicky novel.  However, in this work it emerges as a carefully-crafted work of genius.  Even granting that, however, the true strength of this work is the portrayal of the inner lives of the many characters who pass through the times and events of the novel's setting.  This author deals with a great variety of characters, nearly all broken in some way, or at least lacking some importants parts, but he does so with great deal of love and understanding, both for them individually and for the collective human condition.<br />The unstated but abiding theme is the search for redemption, given the vagaries of how each character defines redemption and how they seek after it.

0547564651|5.0|This book sheds insight not only on how we can help poor children better managing schooling but also how children from wealthy families can benefit more from less protective and less indulging parents. It helps me understand a lot about my own students, their families, and some of the most challenging issues my school grapples with. The research introduced in this book give the book much substance and evidence for all the reasoning it tries to convey.
B0049P1VHS|2.0|To put it diplomatically, \\"The Walking Dead\\" is a modern adaptation of John Wyndham's \\"Day of the Triffids.\\"  In fact, the first episode of \\"The Walking Dead\\" is a blatant theft of the first chapter of John Wyndham's classic:  Both protagonists suffer an injury that permits them to escape the apocalypse, wake up in a hospital bed, know that something is wrong because the nurse won't come and the clock has stopped, and walk into the light of a world in ashes.  There are in fact so many similarities that \\"The Walking Dead\\" seems to any reader who's had the pleasure of reading \\"Day of the Triffids\\" silly and derivative.<br /><br />I also find the acting unbearably melodramatic.  A good director with empathy would have understood that emotional force and reality would have been created if he had his actors understate and under-act their emotional states.  First, that would have been the natural human response -- when faced with danger and intense shock, humans naturally suppress their emotional reactions, thus giving them to analyze the situation and come up with survival strategies.  Second, understatement would have shifted the emotional burden to the audience, making \\"The Walking Dead\\" a much more frightening experience.<br /><br />I think the unfortunate explanation for the enduring popularity of \\"The Walking Dead\\" is that it is a silly and derivative television show.  It is a formulaic recollection of popular culture, television show, and movies that people were fond of once.  \\"The Walking Dead\\" is a testament to the triumph of cliche and nostalgia, and the death of creativity and originality.

0307749606|4.0|You know how your parents tried to teach you a few things as a kid? Things like, don't run while crossing the road, don't talk to strangers and specially, never get into a car with people you do not know... Well, it doesn't really apply in Jack Reacher's case. First, because he travels mostly by hitch hiking and secondly, even if he gets into trouble because of it, he can handle the situation very well. How do I know it? I know because I just finished reading `A Wanted Man'.<br /><br />While heading to Virginia, Reacher hitches a ride in a car with two men and a woman. At first they seem like a team traveling together but soon Jack realizes that not everything is as it seems. It is obvious that two of them are on the run from law enforcement and they are using the third person and Reacher as a cover in case of roadblocks. The woman in the car tries to communicate with Reacher showing the brave side of her character. The identity of the victim is not revealed until the very end, but it is apparent that he was an important person as not only the local law enforcement is working on it but also the state Department, CIA and the FBI are involved. I liked the character of Goodman - he was truly a good-man.<br /><br />This is yet another Lee Child novel where I had no idea right up to the end about how things are going to play out. That did not stop me from playing the guessing game and fail miserably a number of times. Every character has something to hide and every character has lied at some point or the other. There are twists that are completely unexpected to keep uou wondering who has got the final Ace up their sleeves. The plot build up was great and though I had to wait till the end for some actual Jack Reacher action, it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />There's a line that described Reacher trying to look friendly... A huge gorilla like man with a broken nose - trying to look friendly... Am still smiling away!<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable!

B008RZF2I0|5.0|I was apprehensive about buying this album, despite being a big Kamelot fan in the past and enjoying the Sacrimony music video. Perhaps it was because Sacrimony resembles they style of Poetry for the Poisoned a great deal. I liked Poetry, but I wasn't too keen on hearing that much more like it as opposed to the older stuff like The Black Halo.  I have to say I needn't have worried. Kamelot is back in good form here. The style which I alluded to above, is mostly based on cleaner vocals, including cleaner backing vocals than Sacrimony made me think. Silverthorn is more reminiscent of Epica or the Black Halo than it is of Poetry for the Poisoned. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Poetry. But Silverthorn is back to what originally attracted me to Kamelot in the first place. I also don't miss Roy Khan nearly as much as I expected to (Though he was always great), his replacement  shines through very well. I'm not going to go through song by song, but I enjoyed the entire album immensely. No complaints and many pleasant surprises.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|Mr. DeMille never disapointes. John Corey is back and he's as irrasible as ever. You either like him or hate him and I find his character flaws to be entertaining.<br />The downside of a new DeMille book is waiting for his next book and I just hope he NEVER does what so many authors do and start writing books &#34;with&#34; another writer doing all the actual writing... I.e. Tom Clancy, et al.<br />While John is clever, the author is even more so. He incorporates a character from an earlier non-John Corey novel.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I don't know how or why Grisham dragged himself through this book.  He doesn't seem to like anybody in the book.  I know I didn't.  There is no clear moral vision, and his writing now lacks any literary spark.  In my opinion, once his novels took an overtly political turn he began a slow descent.  Now, even the political agenda has lost so much energy that its just another obvious prop.  Poor guy.  Hope he gets it  back, because I really did enjoy his earlier stuff.  To me, this book has all the material for both more drama and deeper psychological exploration, but for some reason, he missed.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|I absolutely love this album by the geniuses of progressive rock, King Crimson. I can't seem to take the CD out of my player, as it's been the soundtrack for my work commute for the past week, and for good reason. I'm a big fan of music that has a dark tone and sound, as well as heaviness. This album not only has these ingredients, but is also off the beaten path in terms of song structure. Each track is stellar, and has its own identity. In other words, this album isn't tight in its consistency. This album is extremely moody, that being the dark element. Besides the mellotron, the real standout instrument on this album is the guitar, which has some if the coolest riffs I've ever heard. And here's something to think about: a couple of the songs sound a lot like material from Yes, and their album TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, released just a year earlier. A coincidence? Most likely, even though Bill Bruford is Yes alumni. Bruford wasn't on TALES, but rather Alan White. I've found RED to be my favorite Crimson album thus far, though I've only heard one other album, that being their first album. I thought nothing would ever top their debut release, but I was wrong. The best track on this album has to be Starless; it's a song that packs a lot of emotion, and manages to hold the attention of the listener through all twelve and a half minutes, and its many changes. I also love the song, Fallen Angel with its darker elements and powerful guitar and drums. This album (RED) is also good traveling music. Overall, this album is nearly flawless, in that every song is a masterpiece, and the remastering is top-notch. I highly recommend this album for any CD collection. It is truly a work of art. 10/10

0316023744|5.0|Library shelves are now jammed with books about the second world war.  These histories of the war seem to become more nuanced, better written, more insightful and more absorbing with each year. Anthony Beevor's massive story of the war, The Second World War, stands at the pinnacle of these histories.<br /><br />Beevor is trained in the arts and theories of war.  He studied the art of warfare under John Keegan, one of the greatest military minds of the 20th Century, served in the British military, and is married to the daughter of Duff Cooper, one of the major figures in the Churchill government during the war.  Beevor started his literary life as a novelist and his major works, including this one, read like novels.  Beevor tells the many stories of the war always with one eye on the personal experiences of the combatants, frequently hideous experiences, but so important to understanding the emotional side of the century's greatest conflict.<br /><br />Beevor sets this history apart from most other histories of the war in his ability to connect events in widely zones.  For example, Hitler's insistence on securing German dominance of the Balkan states in the early spring of 1941, following his rapid conquest of France, led to what turned out to be a fatal delay in the invasion of Russia.  This invasion started in June 1941 but was stalled and eventually blunted by the lethal Russian winter campaign of 1941-42.  In addition, the entry into the war of the United States after its naval forces were bombed at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 enabled Stalin to shift vital forces from Russia's Far Eastern theater back to the Western front, reinforcing the defenses against the German machine.  The story of the Russian campaign, probably the single most important engagement of the war, is made more complete by Beevor's analysis of the complex events enabling Russia to fight an increasingly effective war against Germany.<br /><br />Beevor treats each major battle in the war with great clarity and almost novelistic skill.  The Luftwaffe attacks on Britain in the late summer of 1940, when the fate of Britain was in the hands of very few pilots flying very few airplanes, has been told many times but none to my knowledge raised the reader's tension and fears as well as this account.  This was a battle that Hitler desperately wanted to win.  His attempt to break Britain, if it had succeeded, could have changed the course of the war.<br /><br />Europe was the bloodiest theater of the war but the Far Eastern campaigns, in which Japan assembled as violent a war machine as anything in Europe, were equally thrilling and important.  Beevor tells the story of the American march across the Pacific, island hopping towards the Japanese homeland, with the same sense of drama and uncertainty as in the European story.  The Japanese had occupied and subjugated most of China, they controlled most of Indonesian and the Burmese peninsula.  Their navy was strong and well-trained.  Gradually, however, the ability of the Americans to build ever-greater numbers of battleships and destroyers, ultimately ending in the release of two atomic bombs into two major Japanese cities overcame the initial Japanese advantages.<br /><br />By early 1943, the Allies began bombing the German homeland and the Russian army, having staved off the German near-occupation of Stalingrad, began its gradual grinding down of the German army.  Beevor, who has written a marvelous history of the battle of Stalingrad, is able to convey a sense of the horror and desperation of this battle that few historians could convey.<br /><br />This is a great history of a complex and horrific war.  If only one book can be read on this war - given a list of books that now number into the tens of thousands - one could not imagine a better single book that tells the story more completely.  It is a gripping history.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of Thrones was an excellent read. The book tells a great story and kept me engaged with every page. The book was hard to put down and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I started book two the day I finished book one.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The acting is perfect. The dialog is natural. The story is human and familiar to anyone who ever loved more than once. The cinematography conjures a dark and lush sub-arctic twilight that perfectly matches the maturity and dignity of the characters. This is a film about love and responsibility, honesty, courage and grief. It is haunting.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of my all time favorite books. Reading it before the movie comes out. One of the most unusual lines I've ever read.
B000QUUD60|5.0|Elvis at one of his last great peaks. He would have 2 more before his untimely death in '77 (Madison Square Garden in '72 and Aloha From Hawaii in '73). These DVDs disprove many incorrect theories that Elvis was washed up by the '70's. Too the contrary, the power of his stage presence, vocals, and physicality was matched by no one at the time. As Mick Jagger once stated, \\"There is no one his equal!\\" You'll know what Jagger was talking about after seeing this. Highly recommended!
B00181MHQU|4.0|This movie was very well done, but since I don't like musicals all that much, it was only okay for me. If you like musicals, you will definitely like this movie, though!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive. I've had it almost a month. At first it seemed like the coin generation was way too slow and I did buy I think $6 worth of coins and use them all up in one night when I was bored, but now I've figured out a few small tricks and have more than I can use, over 10,000. Very good graphics.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I choose this rating because what I have read so far is true. If you watch your bread, pasta and sugar intake you will lose the weight. Women really need to because of the lower stomach, which is my case. At my age my middle is a problem area, and I need to learn what I should eat and not to eat to help break down the fat that settles there. I am 15-20 lbs over weight, and do not want to have a tummy tuck, so hopefully reading this and trying to eat right will help. I just purchased this two weeks ago, so I will write again in a few months.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|Love the movie.  The book is different. Its hard to read and doesnt start out as the movie does. Or maybe it does and I just am not reading it right...lol..  Its a tough read for sure. Keep a dictionary handy!! For those of us that don't have vast knowledge of that era's English. Or maybe I'm just stupid.  I still have to give it five stars for the story itself.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle works fine. I like reading a book with it. But when I bought \\"Zo Black\\" to try it with, I couldn't get it to show on this Galaxy tablet's Kindle bookcase. Finally after multiple tries gave up. Several days later I checked and it was there. I don't know if the glitch was Amazon, Kindle, or me -- but it's a pain.

The plot and story make you want to see it multiple times.<br /><br />One big issue I have is with how the scenes weave together. Whoever, the people responsible for continuuity really screwed up.<br /><br />Having said that, it is still a facinating movie. I hope they don't keep going with the Alien thing and branch out as they have begun to do in this movie. We shall see,

B001KZG99A|5.0|This might be more of a \\"guy's movie\\" but I'm a female and I loved it.  The dialogues are witty with a dry sense of humor, that most will miss unless they listen carefully.  Although the sets are sometimes a bit contrived (especially the Afghanistan parts), you just want to believe in this guy and it's easy to overlook them.  If you like science, dry humor and superheroes, you will want to watch this movie!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Okay! In the first book, we got a taste of the harmony between selected heroes and the opposing \\"fractions\\" of the demigod family. In the second one, Rick Riodan opened us to the roman side of the war by introducing their camp and members. Also, in the course of the two books, we learn more of the \\"big picture\\" of this series and the unique and highly detailed personality of these heroes who will be on for a mission. However, It was not the view from both of the camps at once (first book was the Greek side and the second was from the Roman).<br /><br />By the end of the last book, Son of Neptune, we all knew what was about to happen: a Greek vessel, Argo II, is going to land on the roman forum, have a settled talk, and reunite the camps that has been separated for decades. Ummm... NO! They actually did the POLAR OPPOSITE of the \\"diplomatic\\" figure and actually ended up in blowing up most of the new Rome that has survived the battle. War started to rise against the Greek and the Romans, and while the Greeks are in a state of an eminent destruction by the wrath of the proud Roman army, our seven demigod heroes continues on the journey to track down hazel's brother (Nico) and the mark of Athena.<br /><br />Obviously, from the title, you could kind of notice that the \\"mark of Athena \\" is the center of attention in this book and it happens to be so as I have proceeded through the storyline. I am not going to spoil it for you guys yet, but I have to say that the whole thing was very well engineered. Recommended for 5~9th graders.
0525423656|1.0|The book is disappointing. We are not shown any developing political fervor in the main female character and yet her quest to find the young man of interest changes into a willingness to serve the rebellion. How? Why? these questions are not answered.
1401322786|5.0|You must think I'm some huge Mitch Albom nut (since I just reviewed For One More Day not too long ago), and in essence, I really do love his books.  I think Albom writes amazing, short, easy to read novels that are incredibly inspirational and are a great break from heavy reads.<br /><br />I wasn't planning on reading The Time Keeper at this moment, but when I saw it downstairs in the sharing library in our building, I had to pick it up to read.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is about a man named Dor who is the original creator of time.  When he loses the love of his life and climbs to the top of the king's tower (Babel), he is turned into \\"Father Time.\\"  After thousands of years of waiting, Dor is able to return to Earth during the present time in order to help two people: Sarah, a teenager who is dealing with what seems like the rejection of first love, and not dealing with it well, and Victor, a supremely wealthy, elderly dying man who is determined to gain immortality, no matter what the cost.<br /><br />The Time Keeper reminds us that life and moments in our lives are precious and not to be wasted.  Stop worrying about time, and just live, enjoy, and relish those moments because eventually, they will be taken away from you.<br /><br />Another inspiring read from Mitch Albom, and one I highly recommend to his fans! Especially to those who enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven!<br /><br />What is an inspiring book you have read?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The picture quality and video quality is very poor. It may be that the camera in the Fire HD just isnt that good, but I think largely that the software plays the biggest role in it. The option for 1080 resolution exists for Video mode, however, when that mode is selected the app crashes. I have to restart the app and set everything to default settings in the camera section before the video starts working again. This app has a long way to go to be a five star app from what I have seen so far.
0812984412|5.0|If you enjoy a clever wordsmith, and can slow down enough to enjoy the phrasing of a poet, this book will amaze you.  The plots are intriguing, too  but the difference between the good and bad review will hinge on whether the reader appreciated the delectable STYLE of the writing.  Did you enjoy Lolita?  Then this book will be on your top ten.  It's in mine!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Easy, quick read. Becomes repetitive,after a while,but generally good all round,entertainment. I enjoy Ana and Christian's relationship. Will be reading the third one soon!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have only been playing this for like 2 days and I already love it I'm addicted to it. I want this game to myself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
0307352145|5.0|I am an introvert and a scientist.  This book was easy to read and enjoyable, while providing solid discussion and explanation of what is scientifically known about introverts, extroverts and their place in our society. Well-researched and well-written.<br /><br />I will be reading this book again.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all introverts and to anyone with an introvert in their lives. Yes, that should be everyone! :) I only wish that more extroverts and employers would read this book to better understand those of us around them.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's just like virtual city, except you get to design your own town and there are no levels. Similar to Sim City.
B009FO96ZC|4.0|I hadn't bought any McLaughlin albums in years until \\"To the One\\" which I very much enjoyed.  This I like even better as there's more variety overall in terms of compositions and instrumental colors.  Great album!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Fantastic read strongly recommended  for any rock n roll fan or any Manson fan or any idiots that don't understand!!!!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Game play:<br />This is a classic bounce the ball off of the colored blocks at the top of the screen and continue until you have missed the ball and used all of the balls you have available to you. The blocks are aligned in various formations so the game is changing and not always the same. Some of the blocks contain bonus items like stars and when you break the block the star falls and if you hit it with the paddle you get bonuses. It sounds easy but it is more difficult than you think and enjoyable.<br /><br />The control of moving the paddle is well done and it does make the game play smooth and fun. Sometimes you get multiple balls falling and the game can have very fast action. One bonus actually makes the paddle wider and easier to use to return the ball.<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game playing action is smooth and fun to play. The addition of the bonus items either in the blocks or on top of them is fun and it is actually when I miss the ball the most while trying to track all of the falling objects. The game contains no permissions or links to the web.<br /><br />The graphics are simple and effective and the sounds are clear and easily heard. When you leave a game and go back you get the option to continue the game that you were playing. How many games have we had lately when the developer didn't do this? This is a great feature that should be standard in all games!<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />I have no issues.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a classic game that is still fun and the developer has put into the game a few twists that keep it interesting. Changing backgrounds, bonus objects, and good controls and changing game action make this game a keeper. I like this game and it is very well designed and implemented. I recommend it to you and for $0.99 it is worth getting and playing as a quick time waster.<br />Size: The size uncompressed is 4.2 MB.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* None<br />* Nada<br />* Nyet
0345525558|4.0|A rather odd story, but made utterly credible by the author - and this is a first novel! Highly recommended.
1451662432|1.0|I got disapointed because the book is mostly about family and politics. I was hoping for insights about the life and culture of AZ:s movies. You get very little of that in this book. Arnie seem to be a lot more interested in telling us about business and everything else but details about his movie making experience. That made this book uninteresting and to be true quite boring.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|nice game that doesn't make you buy with cash to get through. like the karate chop fish game too ha ha ha
B005HEWEN0|3.0|Neelix is forced to meet face to face with the man who he hates the most.  He was the chief scientist of the Haakonians who defeated Talax in a devastating and horrific war 15 years before.  The scientist is responsible for developing the weapon of mass destruction that killed hundreds of thousands of Talaxians, including Neelix's own family.  Neelix must also face his own personal demons in remembering the war and his actions at that time......<br /><br />This is an OK episode but I couldn't shake the feeling that the writers were trying to bring back the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and asking if the developers of the bomb should feel responsible and have remorse for the use of their bomb. It was an interesting scenario but a little too much of a political theme for me.  I gave the episode a 3 star rating as I felt that Neelix's acting was over the top as his character usually is.  I also felt that Janeway is always too trusting of every stranger and alien race she meets and it is a naive approach to meeting a new alien race every week.  This is still a good series and you should watch this episode as it does give tremendous insight into the character of Neelix.
B009WJX10G|1.0|I think the problem with this episode is simple.  We tune in, or pay Amazon, to watch Sam and Dean do their thing.  We do not tune in to see a few no name actors plod their way through a mediocre script with fake amateur camera work.  These actors simply are not in the same class as Ackles and Padalecki and watching them was, well, kind of tedious.<br /><br />I am voting this episode down because I would like to discourage the producers from ever wasting another episode. This episode could easily have been part of some failed series.  Not an episode in the 8th season of a hit like Supernatural.  Please, producers, never do another episode with so little Sam and Dean in it.<br /><br />If I had known that the time was mostly taken up with no-name actors, plodding through an undistinguished script, with so little of Sam and Dean, I would have skipped it completely.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Decided to get on the bandwagon and read the Hunger Games Series.  So far I'm enjoying the books.  I was a little upset that the book ended so abruptly as I oouldn't download the next one because I had no internet from Hurricane Sandy, but all is well now.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I Really enjoyed this app. It was fun to play. The graphics were great and the game was easy to play.
B005HEWJ2G|4.0|Discipline among the crew members varies as to if they are Federation trained or Maquis rebels. After crewman Dalby doesn't follow Federation guidelines while doing repairs he is insubordinate with Tuvok.  Janeway suggests a field training program run by Tuvok to bring the troublesome Maquis in line and Chakotay agrees....<br /><br />This is a pretty good episode as this brings out more of the personalities of the crew and their interactions with each other.  The question really lies in do you have to always follow the book or follow your mind and heart at times?<br /><br />I like the lessons that Tuvok and the trainees learn and I loved Chakotay's actions with his own people.  I recommend this episode as worth watching.
B008MM9630|5.0|so much fun I love playing it. very addictive and it helps pass the time when you want something tonhelp you relax this is the game to play

B0083SBM7Q|5.0|This product was fantastic came to me brand new unopened and in great shape and arrived on time. I am extremely happy.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found the book to be well written and clear. Starting with the pre-crash then history as to how the author got to that point in time was excellent. The political statements were insightful and show how political we have become, especially in the last almost four years, and more so since the Bengazi attack. I highly recommend this book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|this show is amazing. I love zombies and this one is so good it literally gave me a smile from ear to ear that i haven't shacked all month
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Finally! !!!! A great block breaker game! The control of the paddle is good. Works perfect on kindle fire. It only takes one level and you get challenges thrown at you.Love this game!!!!!!! It was free today but I would have paid good money for this game.
B005LLX582|5.0|'The Tree of Life' is probably the best film ever made in the history of cinema...but alas, so many people simply don't get it, as they are so entrained by Hollywood's block-buster, fast edit, celebrity driven all-fit-the-hero-journey recipe...that they simply miss the genius of it.<br /><br />'The Tree of Life' is an honest, no-nonsene poem about the relationship between man and what he perceives to be his maker. The main female character - who has suffered a tremendous tragedy - asks God: where were you? And then the film - for 20 minutes - moves from the creation of the Universe, to the extinction of the dinosaurs. It is here where Mark Kermode thought that Terrence Mallick lost the plot...but alas, this is where 'The Maker' answers the woman's question: I am that I am...in other words, I am the Universe, Time, Space...I am Life and Death..I am You and the One you lost, the Beginning and the End long after Humanity has seized to exist...and this answer can only be Epic and non-linear.<br /><br />To 'understand' this film, one must clear ALL the nonsense in ones head about what film is and what narration is. This film is a spiritual journey, and one needs to be open and non-judgemental, otherwise one will miss the truth of the quiet voice within...there is no understanding...there is only knowing...
B0096HIEE2|3.0|....that of someone who is selling their sexuality for money and finds themselves seen as less than a full human being by their fellow creatures. Especially in such a sex-negative culture as modern American culture.  The film wasn't great but it was certainly watchable and the performances were generally quite good.  Special kudos to Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey who went (or went back) to some very difficult emotional places.  MM's performance in the last 15 or so minutes of the film, as the strip club manager on the wrong side of 40, who strips one last time for-old-times-sake reminded me strongly of Mikey Rourke's performance in 'The Wrestler.'  Say anything you want about the 'liberation' of human sexual expression in the various parts of the sex trade-- or the movie industry-- fantasy is all well and good until one day you wake up past-45 and the party is OVER. Mike is trying to find that something else to carry him through the rest of his life (which is most of his life) but frustrated at every turn by no one willing to see him as a real person. Some of the most gorgeous man-candy actors alive are in this film, but I'm pleased to say that while we get to see plenty of them, it's not too much and presented in such a way that they're not de-humanized, unless it's a necessary part of the story. This isn't a Florida version of The Full Monty...it's much more serious than that. I think the reason it didn't get better than 3 stars from me is that probably Alex Pettifer. He's pretty to look at and plays a shallow character to contrast with Mike's increasingly-desperate seriousness but he's too stiff.  He isn't able to melt the camera lens in this film the way CT, MM, Joe Manganiello and others of the dancers are able to do, and that's essential to one of the points of the film, which is that the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Got about 25% thru this.  Seemed like more of a chick book...the diary entries got real tiresome.  It was just too cutesy for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a great read, lots of action and drama. I would recommend this book to everyone to read, also watch the movie it is just a little different from the book. Steal really a great read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it :) so addictive can't put the damn thing down. Bought the kindle for reading but now play this instead.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I really enjoyed The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey, and I'm pleased - and somewhat relieved - to say that I also enjoyed Her Sweetest Downfall. After reading the latter, I may just have to read the Forever Girl again. I'm sure that reading it with my revised perspective will add extra richness and colour to the original story (not that it was lacking in any way!)<br /><br />Her Sweetest Downfall is very well-written, moves at a good pace throughout, and the characters are believable. It was interesting exploring the world of Ophelia and the Ankou.<br /><br />Rebecca, please keep doing what you're doing; this series rocks. Great title, too! :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|its amazing and I love it. best game ever I am hooked I just cant expressed how much I love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|My granddaughter and I love playing this game. Just for fun, we decided we were going to try to get the lowest score possible by hitting all the bombs. My granddaughter (age 7) was laughing hysterically. We are having tons of fun playing this game.
B0072OFOM6|2.0|There is little depth or intrigue in this season as it largely is just fighting and sex scenes.  The first season had fighting and sex scenes, but they fit well within the story.  I think the main flaw in this season is that it is not character-driven.  It's all about winning victory over the Romans - so they focus on fighting - but there is no real reason why the audience should care who wins.  I didn't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters and felt disconnected from the entire season.<br /><br />Preseason and 1st season - excellent - they were character focused with a particular focus on the rise of Batiatus - not just on fighting.<br /><br />This season was horrible.  I'd only plan to watch the next season if I can watch it for free and I'm very bored.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant stop playing it. Its the bestest game in the world. Really addicting game. I have 1,000,000 coins. But sometimes there is an annoying glitches that makes me flow in the air. then I fall off the edge.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Disappointed after a few days of playing. Purchasing items is way too expensive.  There is no way to earn any of them free.  Tried to put in the gift codes but they never were accepted.  I am trying to be a loyal Kindle fan yet games like these make me have my doubts.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A real page turner I could not put it down. The writer captured my attention from page one till the end.
0316228532|4.0|there was good character developement but the language of the people who lived off government subsidies was a bit foul.  Do people not try to edit their speech when in school or when official representitives come to call?
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This app is really fun! But the part that gets me going is when I run out of coins and I have to wait for more...:/
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|It wasn't rented for me it was rented for a man who likes the series of the show what ever the show or books are

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the word of God right at my fingertips and everywhere I go. I have the app on my smartphone and Kindle. I use the bookmarks to keep my place as I read the word, and also to mark verses I want to memorize! I take advantage of the devotionals offered and read one each morning. Did you know that YouVersion will even REMIND you to read every day if you go to the menu and set a timer?!?! Sooooo awesome! I believe this has helped to grow my quiet time with the Lord and keep me even more accountable to reading the word and making sure to not neglect our relationship! Thanks so much YouVersion!!!!!
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|It was good although I don't know if I watched them in order or if it really matters it was just the ending I didn't quite get
B009VB97EY|2.0|I rented this \\"On Demand\\" and really wish I had waited for it to come to cable television or something else that is free.  It's like the writers didn't even try to come up with any kind of dialogue at all, let alone a plot that wasn't so riddled with holes it looked like Swiss cheese.  If all you're looking for is Chippendale's with popular current actors from stage and screen, then this is your movie.  I would compare it to \\"Showgirls\\" but I'm pretty sure that one at least had a plot that made some sort of sense.  This movie jumped around so much it was hard to follow anything but the dancing.  The scenes that didn't revolve around dancing were almost \\"Blair Witch\\" grainy, the dialogue was horrific and there is not one single solitary part of the plot that gets fully developed.  I'm incredibly disappointed and for the first time in years I feel like writing to the studio and demanding my $4 back.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|The first song that I ever heard featuring Van Morrison was when he was with Them. The song was \\"Here Comes The Night\\", the British Invasion was in full bloom and while I liked the songs from this group, there was no hint of the genius that was about to embart on a his solo career. I can't be objective on Van Morrison, he could read names out of phone book and I'd think he was doing poetry.<br />Anyway, my buddy and I get all excited every time he puts out another recording because we start thinking\\" Hey, maybe he'll tour to promote this one\\". So far though...nothing! He's known for coming to the U.S. with short notice, playing Boston, San Francisco and New York and maybe Austin or A/C if you're lucky then he's gone.  That was my rant!<br /><br />The Born to Sing is another very good CD, can't get enough of this guy's jazzy swagger. From the very first song I was in that groove that only this man has. It's great to know that there are people like Neil, Bruce, Jackson and Van still doing what they like to do and we like to hear.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Unexpectedly funny. Not quite like the original TV series. Johnny Depp portraied the vampire hexed by a witch and returned from the grave after a few hundred years to get even and find a new family and a new love. Just the right amount of humor.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What can I say you love the series or you don't I love the series this book I read in a day or two 800 pages the books are always better than the movies you get to feel the feelings better this was a great book so much feeling its too bd the series has not gone on
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Pretty good... Make sure you watch the movie AFTER you read the book. I watched it before and the book was a tad boring... The movie, incidentally, was amazing.
0316228532|5.0|The delivery of this product was prompt! Started reading this book right away. Quite different from JK Rowling &#34;Harry Potter&#34;. Describes everyday life as it is. A lot of characters and personalities to be acquainted with. Very good intelligent read.

B0091THRCU|2.0|Great concept.  I cary mine in my back pocket, within the first week the threading started to unravel.  Within a month, started to see obvious distress with the leather - almost looks like its simulated leather and not genuine cowl hide.  I've had high end covers for the iPhone five last over two years.  This one is for the iphone 5 and won't make it through the second month.

B007NU54H4|5.0|My children loves Tinkerbell. I recently bought this movie for my eldest daughter's birthday and they both cannot stop watching it. They watch it everyday and sometimes twice. At the end are a couple of music videos my daughters love to dance to, and finally, The Pixie Olympic Games. A bonus movie, which my girls also enjoy watching. When they watch one, they always watch the other.<br /><br />Another Tinkerbell movie will be coming out in 2014 and they already cannot wait for it to come out.We have all the Tinkerbell movies. I hope they keep coming out with more.<br /><br />My girls have the Tinkerbell Madness
B005LAIIDU|5.0|If you have any interest in \\"Wreck-It Ralph,\\" then video games more than likely played some sort of importance in your life at some point. The 3D computer animated comedy covers just about everything from Pong to Pac-Man to Super Mario Bros to first person shooters, 2D fighters, and racing games and everything in between. Prepare yourself for a nostalgic overload.<br /><br />Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the villain who smashes buildings in a game called \\"Fix-It-Felix, Jr\\" and it just so happens to be the video game's 30th anniversary. When the arcade closes, the characters in each game relax, party, and even visit other games and characters through the power strip they're all plugged into. Ralph is sick of being the bad guy and being treated like an outsider while hero Fix-It Felix, Jr (voiced by Jack McBrayer) gets all of the glory. Ralph eventually starts game hopping to try and prove to everyone in his game that he's worthy of better treatment, but doesn't consider the consequences of his journey or the friendships he may make along the way.<br /><br />Hopefully you have a chance to see this in theaters because the short, \\"Paperman\\" that's before the film is excellent. There's just something about animated shorts without dialogue that always seem to portray the story in a way that taps into your emotions in ways a traditional short just wouldn't be able to accomplish. \\"Paperman\\" has a man meet a woman at a train station on chance. They go their separate ways until he realizes she has a job interview at the building across the street. He spends the rest of the short trying to get her attention with paper airplanes. It's pretty creative and heartwarming.<br /><br />What's so innovative about \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is that it puts you inside the games you grew up on. Seeing how the characters interact with each other when the arcade closes is the most entertaining aspect of the film. Game Central is pretty amazing because you get to see so many recognizable characters all in one place, but the Bad-Anon support group for video game villains is the highlight. Seeing characters such as Bowser and Doctor Robotnik listen to Clyde from Pac-Man as he gives advice to Ralph or witnessing Kano perform his heart-rip fatality on a zombie is like opening the door to your childhood.<br /><br />The video game references are countless. Having M. Bison be the first to bring up \\"going turbo\\" was hilarious and seeing Ralph seek advice from the bartender in Tapper or King Candy (voiced by Alan Tudyk) use the Contra code to get into his secret vault was just amazing. Other concepts are just as brilliant such as the Nesquik sand scene and the Diet Cola Springs with falling Mentos. The comedy covers so much ground as it jumps from video game references to physical comedy (Jane Lynch's Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun punching Fix-It Felix, Jr in the face repeatedly) to the witty (Ralph hitting King Candy with his glasses after Candy put glasses on and declaring, \\"You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?\\" There's even some incredible food related ideas that utilize Oreos, Devil Dogs, and a particularly awesome scene where Ralph tortures Sour Bill (voiced by director Rich Moore) and references Tootsie Pops.<br /><br />This may be the first time dubstep has been used in a major motion picture and it's actually fit the film. When Ralph starts battling (or fleeing) from the massive Cy-Bug attack in Hero's Duty, Noisia's remix of Skrillex's \\"Bug Hunt\\" plays in the background and actually makes the entire sequence even more enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is going to appeal to all ages whether you're a kid or a kid at heart. The younger audience can enjoy it for actually feeling like they're inside some of their favorite video games while adults can enjoy all of the throwbacks and references to the games of their past. Creatively written and downright fantastic, \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" makes you think that an animated comedy this humorous, original, and entertaining has to be unhealthy. You should allow yourself to give into the honey glow though. This is the type of animated feature that will be great for generations.ginal, and entertaining has to be unhealthy. You should allow yourself to give into the honey glow though. This is the type of animated feature that will be great for generations.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love this app!  Amazing in fact.  Like that I can print anything from my phone to my e printer at home!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I loooove this app! Works great on my Kindle Fire. It sometimes freezes, and sometimes force closes, but doesn't every app do that sometimes? It doesn't do it enough for me to get pissy about it. I love Pinterest, and this app works better for me than the desktop site does.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is very attractive and sturdy! I just hope the elastic band doesn't stretch out. I like it alot!
B007THA4FI|5.0|JKR has done it again!  Fabulous book!  As usual, great writing style.  Her characters and places are very vivid.  You become omnicient as you read; and it is really easy to become completely immersed in this tragic story,  which is, essentially, a seamy, but real slice of life.  I was gripped from beginning to end.  The characters remain with you long after you've finished reading...  (And yes, I had a good bawl.).  Loved this book!  I recommend it for mature readers.  I can't wait for her next book!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I thought this game would be fun for my grandchildren. Entered two players and couldn't access first player. Very frustrating!
