0767830520|5.0|When I think of movies, from an artistic standpoint, some of my favorites are \\"American Beauty,\\" \\"The Godfather\\" (Part One and Two), \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\"  However, I think that from the same standpoint, my favorite would have to be \\"Taxi Driver.\\"  This is one my absolute favorite movies.  It is one of those movies that I think has stood the test of time and is still a classic, and always will be a classic.  This is director Martin Scorcese at his best, and may be my favorite De Niro movie (or Godfather II).  \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a movie that shows how terrible society really is, and it probes into the mind of a person going crazy.  Robert De Niro does an awesome job as Travis Bickle, a lonely man who can't sleep at nights, thus becoming a cab driver.  He frequently visits porn theaters as well.  Driving around every night in his taxi, he sees that the scum of the earth comes out at night and walks the streets, in the form of criminals, pimps, hookers, etc.  He feels that the streets need to be washed clean of the dirt that contaminates them.  Amidst all the horror of society and the city, he meets a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepard), and is very much attracted to her.  He attempts to take her on a date, but not knowing much about movies, he takes her to a porn movie, and she rejects him.  After Betsy continually avoids him, Travis gets hurt by this.  Then he comes across a twelve-and-a-half year old prostitute named Iris, who he sees doesn't like what she does and wants to get out of it.  As all of this happens, Travis starts to get sick of the loneliness, and the rejection, and the trash that walks the streets, and he slowly goes crazy.  Then he gets a hold of some guns and a combat knife, and decides to \\"clean the streets.\\"  The action sequence toward the end of the movie is very realistic and very graphic, and it is possibly the greatest and most intense shoot-out ever filmed.  The film has great directing and acting, and is a magificent movie, though somewhat shocking and disturbing.  If you're looking for a classic, then \\"Taxi Driver\\" is not to be missed.
0446677450|1.0|The book spends a lot of time lecturing, scolding, and making often cold-hearted barbs at anyone who doesn't do as the authors say....which isn't hard since the authors don't really say anything at all. <br />The book's entire useful information could be summarized in one sentence: \\"find high-return, tax-free investment opportunities and use them.\\" HOW to do that (the main reason people buy investment books in the first place) is a subject almost completely ignored. Whenever concrete investment examples are given, they are inevitably prefaced with a \\"don't do what we did\\" disclaimer - which makes one wonder just what the point is.<br />On and on the authors go about \\"attitude\\", openly praising tax shelters for the wealthy, jeering at the low-paid as \\"deserving what they get\\", scoffing at the value of education and learning - all the while failing to provide the reader with any practical suggestions. \\"Take risks, stay away from credit card debt\\" - most readers already know this.<br />It's telling that the authors, who have little regard for formal education, praise spam e-mails and cassette courses advertised on late-night infomercials as providing useful financial information. And why shouldn't they? This book is the kind of thing advertised in an infomercial - long on claims, short on material.<br />Perhaps the silliest thing the authors say that full-service brokers provide better returns than discount brokers, something that any experienced investor knows to be false. There's no need to spend money on Morgan Stanley's high commissions - and no need to spend money on this book.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is no question one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. I have had it for over a week and play it constantly (in the car, at work, at home) and have yet to get sick of any of it. Now, that is the true test! If you have a brain, get this CD.You won't regret it!
B000062Y98|3.0|I love Blind Guardian, but...<BR>here's the scoop:<BR>this CD follows in the same direction as Nightfall in Middle Earth--keyboard-saturated, symphonic tracks.  It is very little like the earlier Blind Guardian I love, namely Somewhere far Beyon, Tales from the Twilight World.
0698109163|5.0|John Le Carre's best! This is the book that started my love for this genre.
6301790170|4.0|This is not a review.  I personally love the film.  I want to help clear up some misleading comments from an earlier reviewer who states this film is not available in widescreen.<br />This film was shot in 35mm with an aspect ratio of 1.66-1.  The first time I saw it was in '93 or '94 on VHS and that WAS widescreen.  Amazon even offered a widescreen VHS version before the selection was unavailable for a time, to be replaced by the version they sell now.<br />These are not speculations, they are facts.  Why the distributors choose to release the DVD and the newest video in fullscreen format is beyond me.  Perhaps the same people who are responsible for the \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" release mess had a hand in this mediocrity.

B000063DIR|4.0|This is one kick a** cd!  Who cares if Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake have been replaced!  Diary of a Madman is Ozzy and Randy Rhoads, period!  The sound quality is so superior to the original release and the Remaster.  I love the remix.  Randy always stated that he didn't like the mix on Diary, well, lets hope that this is closer to what he wanted.  It rocks!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I'm really frustrated with those who 'don't expect much' from a movie about a Superhero. Maybe you don't like these types of movies because you expect too much. <BR>As far as superheros go, I'm ecstatic that they've finally brought Spider-Man to the big screen. He's the one superhero that posseses substance and uniqueness. He's not some alien from outerspace with powers or a billionaire that can afford a suit with gadgets. He's just an average guy that was changed when a genetically-engineered spider bit him. In todays world, something like that could happen-and so it seems Spider-Man is the most realistic superhero. <BR>I expect an amazing movie and am happy that they did not pick Freddie Prinze Jr. or Brendan Fehr to play Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire is the perfect choice to bring forth Spider-Mans human nature and troubled reality. He'll show the depth that Spider-Man has. To add with the great special effects and what looks to be a great plot-this should be an awesome movie. I am, however, disappointed that Kirsten Dunst was chosen to play Mary Jane. I will say she is a good actress but it is too bad Kate Hudson had to back out-she would have fit the puzzle perfectly. <BR>I can't wait til May 3rd.<BR>P.S. Does anyone know the name of the songs played in the Spider-Man previews?
B000002IQ9|3.0|Taking in account how many fantastic live recordings there excist of Phil Collins, with Genesis and solo, it's really surprising how dull and uninspiring this, the only official release from his solo career, is. It's now bad, but the performance isn't exceptional by any means, and the sound is unsatisfying.<br />The are a couple of songs on this recording, that I think is what it all should have been like - 'Do You Remember' is very beautiful (though very close to the album version - more interesting is perhaps the piano-only version from his 1997 tour). 'In The Air Tonight' is good, but also this one was done better later - check out the 'Live And Loose In Paris' video from the 1997 tour. 'Take Me Home' is here in a great prolonged version, and is one of the highlights of the set.<br />Many of the uptempo songs - 'Something Happened...', 'Who Said I Would' and especially 'Sussudio' suffers from a somewhat metallic sound, making them less enjoyable than other recordings.<br />All in all, this is a nice record with some great songs, but most of them suffers from the \\"not as good as...\\" problem. If you think this is fantastic, try to get the 1997 video ... or some of the full recordings from either 1994 or 1997 tour - now THAT is great! And why the [heck] weren't any of those released as offical CDs?
B000022TT4|4.0|Being a diehard U2 fan and DVD freak, I lament the short DVD selection - aside from Elevation 2001: Live From Boston, the Rattle And Hum movie and the \\"Classic Albums\\" documentary on the making of the Joshua Tree, there are no DVD's for ZOO TV: Live From Sydney; POPMART: Live From Mexico City; The Best Of 1980-1990; the Achtung Baby videos, interference, etc.; the Under A Blood Red Sky concert and any other that I didn't mention. So we have to make do with what we have. That said, this is a pretty good concert movie (my only compaints being the artsy-fartsy looking black & white picture in most of the film and the exclusion of the song \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" which was on the RATTLE AND HUM album). Otherwise, there are great live performances here, like \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"With Or Without You\\", \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\", the excellent cover of the Beatles \\"Helter Skelter\\", and a fiery rendition of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", which was performed on the day of the Enniskillen, Ireland massacre which Bono talks to the crowd about - U2 just tear it up!!! Those performances are yet another reminder of what a great band U2 are - critical moaning about the movie being pompous and overblown are completely irrelevant. Anyway, great concert movie!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russel Crowe did an excellent job in this film playing the betrayed general who was sent into the gladiator pits. If you have not seen it, beg borrow or steal it if you have to. It is a must see for any movie fan. Once you have seen it you will want to own it. I have seen it four times and am not planning on stopping there!
B00005JKJA|4.0|First of all, let me make this clear: I REALLY enjoyed this movie! The sets, the color, the direction and especially the performances were all first rate. I do, however, have some ideas and thoughts about what was presented on screen. Word has it that this was to be a television series that Lynch was working on. Whether it was being shopped around or whether it had a network behind it, I do not know. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, the plug was pulled. Mr. Lynch was then faced with a dilemma: shelf it or try to condense it into a feature film. Obviously, the choice was to save this story as a film. I do believe, however, that there are many instances where the viewer can see the results of the failed television series. To wit:<BR>1) Robert Forster plays a detective that is in the movie for all of 2 minutes and delivers one line. I do not believe that Lynch would insult a fairly well-known actor by asking him to deliver one line. I believe this character was to be seen much more during the series. 2) The entire &quot;this girl gets the part&quot; storyline, which started off so fascinating, dried up and blew away. It seemed much to intriguing to just drop. Plus, again, you have Dan Hedaya, a fine actor, delivering one or two lines. I don't buy that it was planned that way. Television series. 3) The whole scene concerning the thug stealing the black book. Obviously, that book should have had some signifigance. And yet, that entire scene can be removed from the movie and no one would know the difference. 4) The &quot;Cowboy&quot;. Lynch sets up what may well be the most interesting character in the movie....and then does nothing with him. The &quot;Cowboy&quot; warns that &quot;...if you see me again once, you've done good, if you see me again twice, you've done bad...&quot;. I realize we get a brief glimpse of him later, but I have to believe Lynch had bigger and better things planned for this character. Television series.<BR>Now, that said, let us give Lynchimmense credit for piecing together a movie that is thought-provoking, thoughtful and one-of-a-kind. For him to be able to put together a movie of unfinished pieces into an Oscar nominated (director) film is absolutely a stunning achievement.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D will truely &quot;Rock your socks off&quot; and show that they have written &quot;the greatest and best song in the world&quot;. When I heard Wonderboy for the first time, I loved it. The comedy of Jack Black and Kyle Gass are funny and excellent throughout the cd. There songs are clever, funny, catchy, and honesty can say that this is one of my favorite albums. I listen to bands like Gorillaz, Incubus, Feeder, Limp Bizkit, RATM, Nonpoint, almost anything i get a hold of. I love this cd, and am very excited to have them pump out a couple more.
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book when I was 13 years old.  It fascinated and amazed me then.  Immediately after finishing it I started over and read it again.  Eight years later, it is still my favorite book.  I've read it countless times and anytime I am unsure of what to read next, I can always turn to Ender.<BR>I have recommended this book to many people - most of whom do not have any particular interest in science-fiction, and all have loved it.<BR>The beauty of the book is that everyone who reads it wants to be Ender.  They are sympathetic towards him, and can somehow relate to what he goes through.  <BR>Buy it, read it, love it.
B0000214F0|1.0|When this movie first came out in the theaters (we were stationed in Germany at the time) my husband and I went to see it thinking it was another romans and christians type movie like Quo Vadis and The Robe. Granted, Caligula was a brutal and demented emperor of Rome, but boy were we in for a shock! We couldn't believe our eyes! Here were some highly accomplished actors like Malcolm McDowell and Shakespearean actors Peter O'Toole and Helen Mirren in the most brutal [scene] I have ever seen. After witnessing a lawnmowerlike thing chop off the heads of a bunch of people buried in the ground up to their necks, some beastyality and the so-called *blessing* of the bride and groom by the emperor - complete with a daisy in the [rear], my husband and I left the movie early in total horror and disgust! It should be rated XXX
B00005JKJA|5.0|The reason Blue Velvet will always be David Lynch's masterpiece is because Blue Velvet makes sense. Ever since Wild at Heart, David Lynch has abandoned all hint of believable plots. This is by far David Lynch's greatest movie since Blue Velvet. Not because it makes sense, but because it has some moments that will enchant you and moments that will change your life forever. David Lynch has already blown me away, but he blew me away even further. From the moment you hear the words &quot;Silencio. No hay banda,&quot; your world as you know it will never be the same again. There is a version of Roy Orbison's &quot;Crying&quot; in Spanish that will leave you always wanting to see that movie again just for that scene. There is the usual nudity, violence and language.
B00005KHJR|3.0|There is a well known addage in movies that we all get what we have coming to us.  The same can be said of this movie, whether in regards to the protagonist or the viewer his or herself.  To begin with, I saw a version of the Wicker Man on video years ago and wouldn't have even given it a star for a rating.  The story was chopped up so badly that I felt like the editor had gone to work on me instead.  The limited edition presents the theatrical release and the 'European version' of the film.  A big note of thanks should go to Anchor Bay for seeing that the story line makes better sense this time-and this goes for both versions.  <BR>     To get down to it, this is a movie about sex, or the fertility rites of a certain island just west of Britain in the springtime.  Edward Woodward does a fine job as a police inspector duty-tied to both his job and his religion.  Everyone else, including Christopher Lee seems superflous, however.  Oddly enough, this almost seems to work for the movie, which is in effect about unresolved sex and red herrings.  Considering the overt sexuality and eroticism of the movie, I found the ending to be a little disturbing.  The movie itself can be said to be a metaphor about the dangers of falling down the wrong rabbit hole after you have tried long and hard enough to do so.<BR>     Voyeurs be warned, there is no actual love making going on on screen.  Yet, this is a very sexy and erotic movie, which I guess serves to make the ending more disturbing.  Visually, this film is first class.  Shot on location, the outside shots are gorgeous.  <BR>     Wicker Man is not what you would call the most nailbiting of horror movies.  The answer of whether our protagonist gets the ending suited to him will probably be found by asking the question of whether you deserved to sit and watch this film for its eighty some odd minutes.  There are many better movies out there that deserved a limited edition release more than this one.  The film that comes most tomind is \\"Vampire Circus\\", a movie that has consistently been rated highly by critics, and that has been conspicuously left unreleased by Anchor Bay.  Hopefully they will come around and give THAT film the release it receives.
0060194995|5.0|To Kill a Mocking Bird represents a handful of books and authors that are able to transport the reader directly into it's pages.  One may find that they can relate with one or more of the characters in the book, and sometimes with more than one at a time.<br />This book is about many things, and although it is very complex it is easy to follow due the similarities to life itself. Like life, there are many characters.  Some that are easy to hate, easy to love, and those that are plainly repulsive because of their disrespect for their fellow man.<br />This story is indeed about prejudice.  It paints a despicable ( but reasonably accurate) picture of the hate that permeated the daily lives of those in rural Alabama.  It also portrays the prejudice that is applied to those that are different for reasons other than skin color.  This book is also about the preservation of childhood innocence.<br />Scout and Jem enjoy a pleasure that many of us only wish we could have experienced.  That pleasure was the love and care of a father that stood for what was right to the point of his own harm.  Many of us have never known that type of uncompromising love that Atticus Finch so readily exudes.  He is a man, as Miss Maudie says, \\"was born to do our unpleasant jobs for us\\".  The character of Atticus Finch still stands as a man among men.  We could use a few like him today.<br />Jean and Jeremy find themselves subject to the harsh realities of poverty and prejudice, but they are always able to take refuge in the affection of their father. Atticus makes many efforts to protect his children.  His primary tool is truth.  He speaks openly and honestly with his children.  Again we would do well to take a few notes from Atticus.<br />The true value of this book is it's exposure of hate and bigotry, but it is valuable in so many ways.  It has more to offer than could be considered in any review.  Were it's many complex details of relationship to be reviewed and catalogued by the greatest minds in psychology and human sciences it would require multiple volumes.<br />Although I highly recommend this book, I would offer a word of caution to the reader.  The book uses the \\"n\\" word repeatedly, and I suppose that within it's historical context may be accurate, nonetheless I found it quite unsettling.  There are a number of other explicative statements, but I would suggest that they are also supplied to offer a contextual reality that would otherwise be lost without them.<br />This is a timeless and enjoyable story.  The entire human drama is put on display in a small rural Alabama town.

B00003CXRP|1.0|This movie kinda reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br />The main difference between the two is that 2001 has intrigue, meaning, poetry, and vision.<br />This movie, on the other hand, has volleyballs and fed ex boxes.<br />It is hard to decide which is the better movie. I guess that what decides it for me is that the theme of boy meets volleyball, boy falls in love with volleyball, boy loses volleyball is a bit overdone.  This movie certainly a worthy addition the that genre, however.<br />I hope that I am wealthy enough someday to decide that the extra $20 million that I have burning a hole in my pocket would be best spent by paying a untalented actor to star in a [bad] movie...
B00005MNP7|5.0|\\"Eat to the Beat\\" was a watershed album for Blondie in several ways.  First, it was the follow-up album to \\"Parallel Lines,\\" considered by many to be their best album.  Second, it was their first album after becoming megastars around the world.  Third, the album proved that Blondie wasn't a disco band; \\"Eat to the Beat\\" demonstrated that the band would not allow themselves to be pigeon-holed into any defineable genre of music.<br />Many dislike \\"Eat to the Beat\\" for its echo chamber effects and multi-layered sound.  I argue that these elements enhance the album's appeal.  The echo and reverb effects make Blondie sound like a garage band and actually enhances many of the songs.  The layered approach gives Deborah Harry a richer, fuller voice and allows Blondie fans the chance to peel apart the layers and find something new with every playing.<br />\\"Dreaming\\" has often been called the best Blondie single, and it's difficult to disagree with that assessment.<br />\\"The Hardest Part,\\" while a good rocker, probably should not have been the follow-up single; it petered out at #84 on the US charts.  <br />\\"Union City Blue\\" would have been a better choice as a single with its many hooks.  <br />\\"Shayla\\" is a dramatic song to listen to and demonstrates Harry's maturity as a singer and Chris Stein's development as a songwriter.  <br />The title track, \\"Eat to the Beat,\\" is an interesting rocker but misses the mark somehow.  <br />\\"Accidents Never Happen\\" is a suspenseful rocker with its up and down emotions and is a memorable Jimmy Destri effort.  <br />\\"Die Young Stay Pretty\\" offers Blondie's first trip into reggae, more deeply approached a year later on \\"The Tide is High.\\"  This song has declined in popularity with many fans over the years but still remains interesting.<br />\\"Slow Motion\\" is a classic Blondie song, loaded with enough pop sensibilities and hooks to make one wonder why it was never relased as a single.  The 60s pop and Motown influences are evident in this song that ranks high in the Blondie canon.<br />\\"Atomic\\" was a megahit in England, peaking at #1, but only managed a #39 ranking in the US.  It is a multi-layered effort and includes stellar performances by Destri and bassist Nigel Harrison.<br />\\"Sound-A-Sleep\\" is a nice comedown on the album and is a good lullaby for fans.<br />\\"Victor\\" will wake fans up; it's hard, punk approach catapults the song into one of Blondie's harder-edged efforts.<br />\\"Living in the Real World\\" is another fine Destri effort and a good rock ending to a balanced album.<br />The remaining tracks are not part of the original album; \\"Heroes\\" is one of Blondie's more successful cover efforts, and \\"Ring of Fire\\" was recorded for the film \\"Roadie.\\"<br />Like many Blondie fans, I discovered them when this album was their latest release.  For this reason, I prefer it slightly over \\"Parallel Lines\\"; I also believe the album overall has more memorable album tracks than \\"Lines.\\"  In addition, all the original tracks on \\"Eat to the Beat\\" are penned by Blondie members, while \\"Lines\\" offers three cover tracks.<br />If you're looking for the definitive Blondie album for your collection, \\"Eat to the Beat\\" must surely be a top choice.
B000001FT0|3.0|Not Steve's best work, by any means, but I think the song &quot;Still in the Game&quot; is one of his best. Why do so many people overlook this obvious gem? The disc has a couple of hits and some other interesting tunes, but overall it's only average. &quot;Still in the Game,&quot; though, deserves five stars by itself.
B00000ILDF|3.0|I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars on this film.  I definately cannot give it 5 because it is flawed.  Yes, the seams show with the effects in places, the logic (as far as the aliens go) is off, and yes, the script here is not  sure what it wants to say.  That being said, you'd have a pretty hard time finding more visually beautiful films from 91 than this one.  Simply put, the cinematography/direction here is phenominal (as strangel seems to be the case with all the Alien films).  Why people hate this film with a passion, I'm not sure.  Perhaps it's because it's tone is as rank and bleak as an old grave.  Perhaps it's because it's score is as overwhelming and final as reading the book of Revelations (the bible) for the first time.  Perhaps it's because the beloved heroine recognizes her purpose and chooses annihilation.  All of the mentioned above are virtues of this film, not flaws, and that cannot be stressed enough.  This film is (once you get past all the Hollywood plot BS) about atonement, about salvation, about corporate corruption, about the burn of humanity, about loss, about love (the loss of love), about the criminal justice system (and how it's easy to forget about criminals if a society can simply keep them out of view and hence out of mind), and about life & death (more of the latter than the former).  If people hate this film then it's understandable.  It is after all one of the bleakest films Hollywood produced in the 90's.  However, I'd advise you watch and decide for yourself.  I'd give this film 3.6 t0 4.2 stars.

0312199066|4.0|Selected with the third group of American astronauts in 1963, Eugene Cernan &quot;walked&quot; in space as the pilot of Gemini 9, went around the Moon on Apollo 10, then returned there as the Commander of Apollo 17, the last lunar landing mission. A successful and interesting career even for astronaut standards. His autobiography, &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot;, offers a personal account of those glory days of space exploration.<br />Throughout the book, Cernan portrays himself as a competitive workaholic, and it shows: there are a few introductory chapters on Gene's childhood and career as a naval aviator, and a brief afterthought on life after NASA, but the bulk of &quot;Last Man&quot; is about the space program, the space program, and the space program. Training and mission planning, the mechanics of crew selection, descriptions of his colleagues and anecdotes about their extracurricular activities, it's all there. The flights themselves are recounted in vivid detail, including a nauseatingly dangerous EVA on Gemini 9 and geology trips through the lunar valley of Taurus-Littrow. Overall, as Cernan later reflects, it feels &quot;as if I was getting off one fast-moving express train only to immediately board another&quot;, and describes well the hectic and busy pace of the Moon race.<br />Underlying it all, and well in evidence, is the aggressive &quot;right stuff&quot; attitude usually found with this elite of pilots. It's easy to mistake Gene's self-confidence for arrogance, but he also displays plenty of humour and self-ironic jabs. Cernan was one of the more personable and gregarious astronauts, who clearly enjoyed the social perks that came with the job, and it's this mixture of cocky determination and laid-back charm that make his autobiography a gripping read. Indeed, &quot;Last Man&quot; is a page-turner in the real sense of the word. Particularly enlightening is the episode that saw Geno decline a LM pilot seat on Apollo 16, a gamble that paid off and in the end brought him command of his own mission. So is his relationship with geologist-astronaut Jack Schmitt, whom Cernan only grudgingly accepted on his crew. After some initial macho reservations against the &quot;pebble-pusher&quot;, he learned to respect Schmitt as a tireless worker and supremely gifted individual who helped make Apollo 17 the most well rounded team of all. In between, with the lunar module on Apollo 10 spinning out of control for a moment, or a helicopter crash in training, there are enough close calls for several lifetimes.<br />The human qualities of the book show when Gene talks about his wife, Barbara, and the ordeals she had to go through, with an often absent husband in a dangerous job, while always displaying the brave \\"Mrs. Astronaut\\" to the public world. Ultimately, this ordeal led to the disintegration of Cernan's first marriage, and he speaks with a heightened sense of value about his family of today and his grandchildren. Such a sense of deep appreciation and philosophical reflection also shines through when Gene recounts his awe as one of only twelve humans to ever set foot on the Moon, \\"looking up at the cobalt Earth immersed in infinite blackness\\", and how the unique experience might have changed him. These are moments that he clearly treasures deeply, that left him with a restless yearning forever after. Cernan seems sad, not selfish, thinking that the accomplishments of the ten years of Apollo would probably take twice as long today, in a much more cautious and conservative age of spacefaring. And he expresses a sense of guilt at feeling unable to truly share what he saw in space with the rest of the world.<br />Geno needn't have worried there, for \\"The Last Man on the Moon\\" is a fabulous book. Well-written and informative, it leaves little to be desired. Perhaps, given the awe-inspiring nature of the subject, some chapters fly by just a tad too quickly, and one could have wished for a little more detail here, or a littledeeper thought there. Overall, though, there are few better astronaut biographies. The page-turner qualities, Cernan's unique perspective (here is one of the three guys who went to the Moon twice!) and a subtle, but strong sense of philosophical reflection make for a very worthwhile read, not only for space enthusiasts.
B00005OM4N|5.0|OK people either seem to love her or hate her. Personally, I really can't resist the infectious sound of this album. It's fun, catchy, sexy, dancing music. If you want \\"proper\\" music, then buy something with guitars, piano and real instruments - if you want to bop about in front of the mirror then britney's the only way to go!<BR>Here's my reviews of the songs:-<BR>Slave 4U - 8. I really like this song, but I can't dance to it. I think it's a funky song though and a good plug for the album. <br />Overprotected - 9. This was my favourite song when I first got the album, but since it's been released I've become a bit sick of it! It's a great song to dance too, especially the bit near the end \\"I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, I'm so fed up of people telling me to be...someone else but...me\\"<BR>Lonely - 9. This is a great song, could have been released as a single! It's a bit of a girl power song.<BR>Not A Girl - 8. As Britney's ballads go, this is a good one. But I prefer the more up-tempo songs. It suited the film though. <BR>Boys - 10. I LOVE this song. It'll be a fantastic single. It's very sexy.<BR>Anticipating - 8. This is a fun little song. It's driving-in-your-car music. Great to sing along to!<BR>I Love Rock n Roll - 9. I love britney's covers! Satisfaction was great and so is this. I love how she sugar-coats old songs and makes them young and fun. It suited the karaoke bit in the film too. <BR>Cinderella - 10. When I heard there was a song called Cinderella on the album, I was like \\"nooo! cheese!\\" but it's not at all, it's quite kick-[butt]. Again, great to dance to!<BR>Let Me Be - 9. I really like this, less dancey, but still very up-tempo. Lyrically similar to Overprotected - it's on the same theme. Is it a message to her critics?<BR>Bombastic Love - 9. Again, I thought this song would be awful from the title. But it's pretty cool actually, it's groovy and quite unexpected. It's got the lyrics of a 12-year-old, but I still like it!<br/>That's Where You Take Me - 7. I quite like this. \\"Up baby, up baby\\" bit is good. It's an uplifting track.<BR>What It's Like To Be Me - 10. This is probably my favourite on the album! It's like a great remix (except it's not a remix!). Fantastic to dance too, very funky and I like the lyrics. \\"Don't get it twisted boy...\\" <BR>This is without a doubt, Brit's best album yet. Keep it coming Ms. Spears!
B000002JS6|5.0|Simply stated, this is the best rock album since the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers.  I love it.  Most of the songs are quite simple, but I can't stop listening to this one.  Brian Johnson is such a good singer.  Angus Young's solos are classic.  This was Ac/Dc's first album after the death of their lead singer Bon Scott, and in my opinion they rebounded to make the best album of their career.  \\"Back In Black\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" are the popular songs, and they're great, but you can listen to this album start to finish and love every second of it.  I believe this album was rated as one of the top 10 rock albums of all tie.  It definitely deserves it.  If you love straight up, ...rock'n'roll, this is the best cd you can ever buy.
B0000524CY|5.0|obviously anything I say about the movie has already been said. it's scary and a classic. <BR>I'm writing simply to tell everyone to scroll down to the review titled \\"Dumb Horror Flick\\" so you can all witness the writing of what has to be one the stupidest individuals every allowed access to a computer. seriously, read his review, it had me laughing for 10 minutes. this kid has to be partially either retarded or have sustained heavy blows to the head as a young child.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is good for so many reasons.  First of all, I think Kirk Hammett got real comfortable playing lead guitar around this time.  His solos are fast, and also thoughtful.  Second, James Hetfield is an unbelievable rythym guitar player.  Another thing is that the lyrics to this album are a step up from their previous two albums.  \\"Disposable Heros\\" is an example of this.  It's written  from the perspective of a front line soldier whose purpose is to die.  It's extremely well written and one of the best songs on the album.  \\"Master of Puppets\\" is personally my favorite, this song is an epic, with great rythym guitar, a great solo, and good lyrics. I can't say enough about this album, you should just listen to it. The instrumental, \\"Orion\\" is unbelievable.  Every song is great, and if you are a fan of metal you should go out and buy it now!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer have been the best metal band in the world for almost 20 years now and are still going strong and their growth with producer-extrordinaire Rick Rubin starts here. Blistering, mind-blowing from beginning to end, 30-something minutes of sheer speed metal madness. The first tune, \\"angel of death\\", is their best song and boils the blood to a near homicidal state. The lyrics, sung with Araya's uncomparable growl, blend with the guitar riffs/drum beats of Hanneman/King/Lombardo respectfully to near perfection. The seperation of Slayer to the rest of the metal world and almost all of rock n' roll in general lies in their lyrical ability. This partricular album is a concept album dealing with the Holocaust. All in all I would put this up there with Beatles White Album, Led Zeppelin 2, Ride The Lightning, and some other choice lp's as one of the best recordings of all time.
B000062YAZ|4.0|ok,i'm changing my old review, i know i gave this cd 2 stars before, but i just can't stop listening to it now.  This is probably the fastest and heaviest(but not the best) thing you will ever hear.  I love their speed, and I know they're one of the most important metal bands ever, but I don't think they are as good as Megadeth or Metallica.  This album does sound a little repetitive.  It lacks the diversity of any album by Metallica, but I can still listen to this cd sometimes. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't have as much diversity as I would like.
B000002J09|5.0|Listen and feel the power, the Cosmic Energy.  Four spirited and talented musicians, layers of complexity, absolute unity.  Does anybody remember Talent?  Too many words would miss the point.
B000002N2N|5.0|This has always been the best Ramones album.  The Ramones were always a great live band, but could also take advantage of a studio.  This, however, outshines any studio effort they ever made (although Animal Boy is a very close second).  The pace is frantic, and the songs are, well, the songs.  The sound is far better than most live albums of this era.  Go for it!  What do you have to lose?
B000001EMW|5.0|This album is definetitly one of my favorite. these four guys make this sound so much like Metallica it's unreal. I mean, i can understand the cello as a substitute for guitar and bass, but they even make drum sound alikes with cellos in some parts. My personal favorites are &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;. They also make &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; sound overwhelmingly like the original except for the absence of vocals. Personally, the absence of vocals on this cd makes it sound twice as better than the originals alone, not counting the other awesome things they do. Bottom line- get this cd as quickly as possible.
B000002BE9|5.0|After falling in love with Apple's 2nd album, When the Pawn, getting to know this album was a top priority with me.  Tidal fits every expectation I had for it, in all the right ways.  Songs like \\"Sullen Girl\\" and \\"Slow Like Honey\\" connected right away.  When Fiona veers towards the jazzy side of her oeuvre, on those songs, she's in her element.  There are the more pop-ish moments like \\"Shadowboxer\\" and \\"The Child Is Gone.\\"  There's hard rock \\"Criminal\\" and \\"Sleep To Dream.\\"  And there's the mellow sensitive stylings that are pure achievements in the field of melody, \\"Pale September\\" and \\"Never Is A Promise\\" that have become Fiona's staple.  If Fiona had a musical counterpart, it wouldn't be Tori Amos or Alanis Morrissette (it makes me cringe even to make the often-discussed Alanis comparison) it would be Kurt Cobain, both young tortured souls who created great art by reliving their personal pain in song.  It's quite breathtaking to hear Fiona sing \\"You'll say you understand...But you don't understand.\\"  We probably will never grasp how battered she feels as a human being.  Hearing what a sensitive and dark person she is, to think of the ways that the media vilified her must have harmed her mindset, is very angering indeed.  What's for certain is, that this album will be looked at, many years from now, as the starting point for one of the rock world's most enduring artists.  Let the music do the talking, and you'll see that Tidal is one of the most underrated albums of the 90's.
B000003TAR|5.0|This month marks the eighth anniversary of Kurt's death and listening to the sad, final message he left the world now seems like a reminder, or warning of what was to come. Never in the history of popular music has a public figure so quickly been overwhelmed by success and adoration, and run for the hills in the wake of that attention. \\"In Utero\\" is the frightening sound of a young man battling his demons and ultimately, losing.<br />These aren't songs as much as they are violent soundscapes that paint a picture of the inner turmoil we all feel, but somehow grow past. Cobain never did and paid with his life, those of us left behind get to witness and hear human emotion at it's most raw and naked. \\"Dumb\\" grabs hold of me and won't let go and \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" keeps echoing in my ears. \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" is just plain scary, I Love It.<br />A Masterpiece. Essential Listening.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't want to influence anybody's opinion on this band, because you need to experience them for yourselves. I have heard a lot of mixed comments about them, but I know the position I, myself, take on their music. I am mainly writing this review to up the rating a little bit.
B00005JKED|5.0|Training Day was a gritty, urban movie that was unpredictable. I an avid lover of Denzel and his movies have to admit that I was always looking for the best in him and didn't want to believe that he was a corrupt cop. I totally agree with all the deleted scenes (as found on the dvd). The alternate ending was weird. I recommend this movie for those of you would like to see Denzel in a totally different kind of role.
6304712936|5.0|A lot of people will disagree with me when I say something like that, and they may very well be right, but for my purposes, Amadeus is the greatest movie ever made, if one has the patience to sit through.  Indeed, Amadeus is a movie that likely would not succeed today because it is as methodical as Salieri's mind, and the movie only really begins to pick up pace after the Don Giovanni sequence, after all the plot elements are in place.<br />There is a new director's cut coming out soon, and there is an added scene in which Constanze takes off her top for a favor for Salieri.  For me, I think the movie was better without this scene because throughout the movie it is clear that Salieri is not interested in romance or Constanze.  Yet, when she comes into Mozart's bedroom at the end of the movie their disgust for each other is more understandable.<br />Many will say that this is a great movie because it is a wonderful story of jealousy, but to me this seems to be too simple--there is more to it than mere jealousy.  While Salieri is obsessed with Mozart and says that there wasn't a moment in his life he didn't know his name, it is not towards Mozart that he is truly bitter, but towards God, who places within him, so he says, the passion for music but not the talent to create it.<br />More importantly, God does place the talent of music in a person who is not religious and does not believe.  How can this be, Salieri wonders.  The only logical explanation he comes to realize is that Mozart is truly the voice of God.  It is God who becomes Salieri's immortal enemy, not Mozart, and the only way Salieri knows to get back at him is to have God Himself write the music to a requiem mass, without knowing that is intended to be for His creation's own requiem mass.<br />Some people have speculated that Salieri intended to steal the ownership rights to the requiem mass after he is through with Mozart, but I don't see this from the movie.  All Salieri cares about is the music itself,and rather than killing Mozart and finally destroying God's creation, he keeps him alive to write the music.  This is the only way he knows to get back at God.<br />And what does God do?  He kills Mozart; rather than using him for Salieri's purposes, he lets his creation wither and die.   And as further punishment he keeps Salieri alive, to see that his once beloved music slips into mediocrity, while the music of Mozart is resurrected, so the speak.<br />This kind of story is the mark of a truly great movie, and above the level of a petty movie about jealousy.  For me, it is the best movie ever made, but I'm sure many people will have other things to say about that.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Although I've read many of the fine reviews of this film, and have agreed wholeheartedly regarding it's humor, acting, script, art direction, etc., I feel that most of the reviews have missed the point of this film.  This is quite understandable, since I must admit it took a couple of repeat viewings for me to \\"get it\\".<br />The film can be summed up with Drew Barrymore's character's pronouncement at the PTA meeting:  \\"It's meant to be ironic.\\"  This film is soaked in irony.  I won't reveal all the details of that irony for those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it and pondering it for themselves.  What I will say is that the irony and the \\"things are not as they appear\\" and the \\"what appears good may in actuality be a force of evil and vice versa\\" themes of this film are both something that all humanity can relate to.  Sparkle Motion's talent performance is truly, on reflection and in retrospect, a celebratory moment.  The film expresses these truths in very original, thought provoking, humorous, and emotive ways.  It is on repeat viewings that I've come to determine that this film is not just great, it's actually quite brilliant.
B00005JKYS|5.0|We Were Soldiers has done something that no other movie has been able to do. The Vietnam war has long been shunned, and its participants dishonored. Those movie gives a new look at the start of the war, the feelings of the soldiers and their families, and a suprisingly human look at the enemy. Along with the usual host of action and surprises, you begin to care deeply for the people in the movie. If your cup of tea  isn't usually war movies, I would highly recommend you make an exception for this film. It will seriously change your view of the Vietnam war and those who fought it.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This album hits your serotonin receptors like an atom bomb. It's damn near impossible to listen to this whole thing without rocking out to the beat or singing (screaming) along. Genevieve Williams describes it as a placeholder. It's not. It grinds Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral into the dust with blasting guitar noises and soul-wrenching rhythms. It's all the quality of a normal-length CD concetrated into an EP.<br />No, I'm not a sales rep, but if you're even considering buying this album, you want it. You've been needing it for years to fill that empty gap in your life... You know, that gap a lot of us tried to stuff with trite nu-metal garbage and jerking off... \\"Broken\\" is a confrontation with the naked id -- an album for a dysphoric world, for beautiful destruction, for screaming at the top of your lungs at everything and nothing, for fear, for angst, and somehow -- for hope. Even as galaxies collide, supernovas explode, and the universe shatters, there is a phoenix hidden in the flames on the album cover. When we have reached the bottom, there is nowhere to go but up.<br />...Alright, maybe I'm over-dramatizing. Maybe I *am* a sales rep =). Maybe Trent Reznor is just trying to capitalize on a vast teenage market of angst-turned-commercialism. Nonetheless, this is still the perfect album for when you're angry, upset, depressed, or confused like so many of us are. Works better than prescription medication. Reznor may repeat many of the same self-destructive themes in his songs, but guess what? So do we in life. \\"Broken\\" brings to consciousness that relentless voice inside our heads that tells us to screw everything and just let it all out. By the time I'm done listening, I have nothing left to vent.<br />More to the point, if you enjoy loud, engaging, sonorous mayhem, this album is for you. I consider it Reznor's best work to date. Listen. Rage. Repeat.
6304362498|4.0|This was a peerless adaptation of Orwell's 1984.  The visuals of a London crushed under the pressures of war and a war-economy perfectly match the leads.  Here, John Hurt plays the hero, Winston Smith, looking as if he hasn't had a good night's sleep or a decent in ages.  The state of Oceania, Smith's home, is apparently the descendant of a British socialist state emerging from a WWII that never ended, though the film follows Orwell's lead in not attributing his police state to any one country.  Oceania's hapless citizens are continually repressed.  The irony?  Oceania has no laws - save the free will to break any laws that the state could conceive of.  Smith has much to do with this, since he works for the ministry that continually crafts \\"newspeak\\", the stripped version of english in which speech comes to resemble some abstract computer language.  With its progressively binary quality, newspeak saps imagination from language, paving the way for a society in which even talk lacks imagination.  Secretly harboring thoughts of another life, Smith meets and falls in love with Julia, but also courts the dangerous and subversive ideas of O'brien (Richard Burton, in his last role).  Ofcourse Smith's rebellion will come to a short and painful end, but not before Smith visits Room 101 where the state will demonstrate its power to crush his will.  Hurt's performance is exceptional because his eventual surrender to Big Brother rests not on the state's power to keep him an ignorant lackey, but in light of the explosive ideas that had offered him a way out.  An excellent film.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Why so much confusion over the non linear approach to this great movie?  I have seen it twice but I understood the framing the first time.  It is told in thirds.  The first third which lasts approximately one and half hours is the fantasy life and rememberances of Diane Selwyns life. She wanted to come to Hollywood and become a star, which in her dream she has all the makings of one.  In the dream she helps Rita who needs her desperately to find out what happened in her accident.  Rita also gives all control to \\"Betty\\" until Club Silencio.  When Diane/Betty wakes up from a prod from the cowboy...She is her real self which is Diane.  Diane is a washout..burnout third rate actress who got to Hollywood through the help of neopotism. Rita/Camilla is the star who stole her thunder and her heart.  So to get revenge she hires a hit man to knock her off. About 10 min into the the second third when Diane has her roommate remove her stuff from her apartment there is a jump in time as to Diane remembering how things really went down with Camilla.  You can discern this because the roommate picked up her ashtray yet when Diane and Camilla are having hot and bothered sex the ashtray is very much present.  Diane is then rapt with confusion, guilt, and completely depressed over the fact that she does not know herself, she was not a strong actress or a good enough lover to keep Camilla.  Depressed she kills herself finally putting a silence to her turmoil. Brilliant
B00000JXVK|5.0|What can anyone say about this movie except that it is the definitive documentary about American motorcycle racing circa-1970, before big-bucks changed the sport.  Regular guys like Mert Lawill driving along in his Ford Econoline van with his racing bike in the back.  On the way to a race they would stop and test their bikes on farmer's side roads!  Nowadays racers ride around in Gulfstream jets and their (many) race bikes are hauled around in huge corporate-sponsored semi trucks. As an airline pilot, I frequently fly over what's left of the old San Jose Fairgrounds and I always remember seeing my first Mile there in 1977--the dirt clods from the racer's back tires flying through the cyclone fence at turn one where we were standing!   A must-have, especially now that it's on DVD.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I'm getting really sick of people's opinions being based on the opinions of the media!  The film is excellent, and i'm not saying this because i am caught up in the \\"Hype about Harry\\", i'm saying this because it's absolutely true.  It has amazing special effects, and the actors really bring out the full potential of each character!  It's a really great movie, and I know it would be a great addition to your shelf.
B000002L7J|5.0|how perfect are these lyrics? absolutely. hey, morrissey may have had his moments of despair, but overall he was a very sarcastic person. those imbeciles who don't understand the concept of sarcasm should bury their heads in the sand and continue to listen to tripe like creed and kravitz, lyrically challenged to the last. music can MEAN something and be done in a clever way that the beforementioned will never achieve. alas, i digress...<BR>anyway, on this album, as is the case with the queen is dead, johnny really goes off on his guitar. the strumming in \\"rusholme ruffians\\" and \\"the headmaster ritual\\" is truly inspiring. <BR>always criticized for being a depressing lot, you will be hard pressed to find a more emotional song than \\"well i wonder.\\" a very simple, but moving moment to this album. if you haven't heard \\"how soon is now?\\" buy this album just for this song, though you will find all of it excellent. this one song is arguable the quinessential track of the '80's. brilliant and haunting.
B00005OAIE|5.0|There are few CDs around these days that I can listen to from front to back without one complaint. This is my latest addition to that list! Think Dave Matthews, meets Seal, and has an affair with Everything But The Girl. Kind of a funky, bluesy folk rock vibe with just a hint of a jazz feel. &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is simply a cool, laidback, foot-tappin record that, when I first listen to it, immediately seemed like a great listen for a long coastal drive. No, John doesn't get too heady lyrically -- and no, he doesn't need to. I think the biggest mistake people make is thinking that everything needs to &quot;mean something.&quot; This isn't the cure for cancer, it's MUSIC. What's John's created is a cool, relaxing vibe that won't put you to sleep. Today is Monday...since I bought &quot;Room for Squares&quot; on Saturday, I 've tried it in the car (along the sunny New England Coast with a sunroof wide open, by the way), while cooking dinner, on the subway and walking the streets of New York City. It fits everywhere and the smile that dances on my lips as I listen has been undeniable.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is solid from top to bottom. I listen to this ENTIRE CD everyday. The Dave Matthews comparisons are fair, but he has a style unto his own. Also, these comparisions would be made less of a deal had Everyday not been released because it was DMB's first album on which they didn't jam.
0446678430|1.0|I did like Rich Dad Poor Dad, and started to read cashflow quadrant...this book is nothing but the same concepts in a little more detail....but all the same watered down concept of the first book...I glanced at a few other books, and have caught on to this....save your $$$$,  The only thing you should know is that your contributing to the wealth of one man, who makes a living out of suckas's who pay for these way too watered down, and tired concepts......
B000002HK4|5.0|I had heard a lot about Dream Theater before I bought this, but I had never heard any of their music before. I've got to say that I am impressed. They don't really sound like anything out there right now. This CD has great instrumentation and vocals. The guitars and bass are especially great.<br />The title track has to be one of the longest, but best songs I have ever heard. The cover songs of Led Zeppelin and Elton John are great. I totally recommend this album to anyone looking for some great rock n' roll. I am going to buy more DT albums soon. I give this on five stars.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I'd give it less if I could.<BR>I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life on this. thankfully, I paid nothing to see this film. I kept waiting for it to get going. then, everything happens in one predictable flury of events and then it ends.<BR> <BR>The following should be read in the cynical tone intended:<BR> <BR>This is Hollywood predictability at it's Best. Lets start with The 2 main characters flying playing \\"chicken\\" getting confused and at the last minute pulling it through for an oh so thrilling near hit. THIS won't show up later in the film, no! <BR>ok, then Ben Affleck Dies (hurray!) but, wait. he can't die he's the star and he's only been in the movie for about 20 minutes. Then His best friend, Josh Hartnett hits on his girl!  Didn't see that coming either.  Wow, and the sex scence in the dimly lit parachutes. how freakin' original.  Then Ben comes back and shrugs his pal. how could he after all they've been through together? <BR> (I'm using their real names not the charcters names for it doesn't really matter what they're called in the movie. You can  never get past that you are watching Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, for neither could act enough to make you believe they are someone else)<BR>Then the 2 make up the night before the day on infamy. good thing too cause they are the ONLY TWO PIOLTS LEFT WHO CAN FLY AND SCARE AWAY THE ENTIRE JAPANESE FLEET!!!!!  <br />After watching the movie I came to a conclusion that it must be in Ben Affleck's Contract that he can not die. He lived through Armagedon(I almost didn't) and here He crashes twice, is shot at numerous times and still out lives his best freind, Josh, who takes a bullet for him goes home and raises Josh's Son and marries the girl.  Josh Hartnett needs a better manager to say he gets to live and gets the girl. <br />And lets not forget the fine acting by veteran actors Alec Baldwin and Jon Voigt  (Alec hasn't done anything good since BettleJuice and Jon Voigt, well Give me Deliverance. Jon Voigtis as believable as Roosevelt as Kevin Cosnter was as JFK. They should of found the guy who played Roosevelt in Annie-the 1981 version)<BR>Then there's the carnage done in full hollywood gore. Except the pretty young nurse who just got engaged, she had time to get her hair and makeup done before she died.<br />This movie was beyond Terrible. They made Pearl Harbor look like a victory for the USA. WE GOT OUR [REAR ENDS] KICKED <br />If you going to Write a romance around a war. create a war or keep it accurate and don't name it Pearl Harbor. <br />As for editing. It was supposedly up for and possibly won an oscar. I found it choppy and at one point where Ben is holding Kate with her head on his shoulder. the cameras jump back and forth from different angles to find Kates head on a different shoulder in each shot.  So much for the academy's keen eyes for this sort of thing.  The editors should of chopped off about an hour. That may of made this movie a bit more tolerable or at least not be as much of a waste of time.<br />I really hope I gave enough away to keep anyone who hasn't from watching this.<br />I wasted Three Hours of my life. I don't think the war lasted as long as this movie did. By the middle of the war, I was laughing. Anyone who found this movie surprising really needs to get out more. And anyone who thinks it was accurate needs to read a history book.
B000002UB3|5.0|Beatles fans are obviously divided over what their favorite albums is. Some prefer Sgt. Pepper, some prefer The White Album, for me, it's Abbey Road. In my opinion, I found The White Album a mess. That album sounded really uneven to my ears and difficult to sit through both discs. Plus the McCartney ballads did not help, like &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;. So with Abbey Road, the Beatles continued the more down-to-earth approach they did on The White album, this time succeeding with flying colors. The album features some engineering help from a certain 19 year old named Alan Parsons. The Beatles went for perfection and it seems that was the idea Alan Parsons had in mind (that idea obviously went for Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, since Parsons was involved in that album, and the Alan Parsons Project, since he wanted to continue his studio perfections to his own musical ideas). Perhaps the biggest surprise of Abbey Road is the presence of synthesizers! Yes, synthesizers. People often like to think Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's self-entitled 1970 debut was the first rock album to use synthesizers, but Abbey Road pre-dated ELP by a year, and several songs use the synth: &quot;Because&quot;, &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. Simon &amp; Garfunkle used synth on &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot; on their 1968 album Bookends, which also gets overlooked as the earliest pop recording with synth. I don't think a whole lot more can be added about Abbey Road that hasn't been said millions of times, but seeing how the Beatles progressed from teen-oriented love songs of the early to mid-1960s to more sophisticated, polished rock at the end of the 1960s is really impressive indeed. Abbey Road works better than the White Album in my book because the band was actually trying to make some effort in being a band again (didn't last, of course). I might have not listened to Beatles albums in some time now, but it's really impossible to ignore the impact these guys had on the world of popular music. Abbey Road was the Beatles' offical last album (Let it Be was recorded before Abbey Road, scrapped, doctored by Phl Spector, then released in 1970 to go with the movie documentary), and in my opinion, their best.
B00000K19E|5.0|I first saw the film with my family and was dazzled by the special effects and the unsual plot. I admit I did not understand it much but made a mental note to see it again.<br />When I bought my home theatre, The Matrix was one of the first DVDs to buy. I have watched it 10+ times and will watch it again and again.<br />The story is fascinating and makes you think.. Some  of the technology shown or implied in the film is already there or under research. The rest remind one of Leonardo Da Vinci's drawings of flying machines.. The danger of humans being controlled by technology of any kind is not that imaginary..<br />The Matrix is an artificial \\"real world\\" created to entrap humans and let them live their \\"lives\\" in a virtual reality while \\"real reality\\" is in a dark parallel world where time and space are mostly irrelevant as there is technology to allow crossing the borders.<br />The visual and sound effects are simply stunning. If you jump to section 29 of the DVD you will see and hear a battle taking place all around you - while bullets hit walls in front of you, empty shells fall on the floor behind you, guns fire from every corner of your room and you wonder what may jump out from behind your armchair or coffee table.. Just fascinating...<br />Choose the Follow The White Rabbit version of the film to see how the special effects were created and how \\"bullet time\\" was invented and put to the best use I have ever seen. <br />I don't think I will get tired of watching The Matrix.  I hope a sequel will come out soon and I will buy it immediately.<br />The Matrix is the closest thing to Virtual Reality you can watch on your TV screen.  I hope that other film directors will take lessons from it and we will see more IE (Immersion Entertainment) films soon.<br />P.N., Kent, UK
B000001F3C|5.0|This is when U2 truly had a message. When something affected them so much that they had to write songs about it. The civil war in Ireland was in full swing at this point and someone needed to capture the feelings of a nation. U2 did that.<br />The music on this CD is angry, soulful, and energetic all at the same time. The drums on &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday&quot; are awesome. You can also feel them moving into their second music style with &quot;Surrender.&quot; The keyboards on &quot;New Year's Day&quot; are just awesome. &quot;Red Light&quot; just leaves you speechless.<br />&quot;War&quot; really captures the feelings and emotions of young men caught up in the middle of a pointless civil war. I'm glad that in America there is no open fighting betweens members of different religions. I give this masterpiece 5 stars.
B000002J2D|4.0|I've been a Genesis fan for years but never did get around to picking up this cd until recently.  I've got pretty much everything else from the Collins era (Duke, Trick, Wind, Abacab, etc) and love them all.  Of course I had already heard &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; so I was curious to see if the rest of the album was any good.  Quite frankly, this is a solid album.  The arrangements and melodies are great.  &quot;Snowbound&quot; is an awesome song that I never tire of, as is &quot;Deep In The Motherlode&quot; and &quot;Undertow.&quot;  I enjoy listening to this cd from beginning to end and am happy that I finally got it.
1577311523|5.0|An absolutely brilliant book that boasts the rare combination of inspiration and practicality. Many spiritual, new age publications are all very pretty, and love to wax lyrical, but this book tells it like it is in normal, everyday language using questions asked by many many people in many personal and group settings with the author. It gives us the tools with which to work in bringing about inner peace... it is something refreshing: a promise that can actually deliver.
B00004Z459|5.0|I loved this cd. All of the songs could get stuck in ur head in a good way. My three favorites are Papercut, In the End, and One Step closer. All the other songs are very good too. In my opinion this is a must buy cd.
B000008H1U|4.0|The early '80s weren't exactly the best times for Tull. They decided to do a more synth heavy approach with the likes of &quot;A&quot;, Broadsword and the Beast, and Under Wraps with less than spectacular results (or sales, for that matter). After Under Wraps, Ian Anderson started suffering throat problems and it was uncertain if he was able to sing again, but it turned out he was able to by '87. By the time of Crest of a Knave, Anderson decided to do the right thing, and return to guitar-oriented rock. The synthesizers are pushed more in the background, and deservedly so. I bought the cassette of this back at the end of 1991, which is missing &quot;Dogs of the Midwinter&quot; and the &quot;The Waking Edge&quot;, those were only available on the CD, making this one of the earliest recordings to feature tracks you can only get on CD. I remember very well back in 1990 when I was 17 years old watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel entitled &quot;Fish 'N' Sheep 'N' Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, which documented Anderson's life how he raised sheep and a fish hatchery in Scotland, and while at the same time showing him recording Crest of a Knave (the song I remember hearing on that documentary was &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot;) at his home. That documentary inspired me to get Crest of a Knave and I was not disappointed. My favorites are &quot;Farm on the Freeway&quot;, &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, and &quot;Mountain Men&quot;. It seems that only Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg were on this, and so that means that drum machines are used, but surprisingly in a rather inoffensive manner. This was the album that beat Metallica's ...And Justice For All for &quot;Best Metal Album&quot;, a little strange for Tull indeed, I know for a fact many Metallica fans felt a bit insulted over that. As far as I'm concerned Crest of a Knave is by far Tull's best release of the 1980s, and I very highly recommended, but if you're new to Tull, of course try their classic albums like Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, or even Songs from the Wood first.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are my favorite band now. Their debut CD is awsome. I rarely listen to anything else but The Strokes. When you first buy the CD, Julian Casablacas's voice can be barely heard but as you listen to it more the voice grows stronger. That may sound strange. This is that type of CD where you can listen to all of the songs instead of skipping songs. All of the songs are excellent. This CD inspired me to want to learn to play the guitar and drums.<br />Is This It - It starts out a little slow and somewhat borring but it grows on you and you will in time love it.<br />The Modern Age - An excellent song. Great rhythm and lyrics.<br />Soma - Absolutely wonderful. Good lyrics.<br />Barely Legal - Lots of different ryhthms makes this song very interesting. The drums are very good on this song.<br />Someday - One of my favorites. I love the words. I could listen to this song all day.<br />Alone, Together - Very mysterious. The words are very honest. Great guitar.<br />Last Nite - Very good.<br />Hard To Explain - Fabulous rythym. Another one of my favorites. I love how it starts out somewhat slowly then speeds up then pauses then begins again with another verse.<br />When It Started - Great bass giutar in this song. Probably my least favorite song but I still love it to death.<br />Trying My Luck - I love this song. I really like the drums in this song and the words are special.<br />Take It Or Leave It - Wonderful guitar and the rythym is excellent. Julian Casablancas did a very good job on this vocally.<br />At the end of the last song I was left wanting more. This is my favorite CD and I would definitely reccommend it. So buy it and love it! Peace!
0441008615|3.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors... i LOVED &quot;Neverwhere,&quot; &quot;Stardust,&quot; &amp; &quot;American Gods.&quot; But i just recently decided to read &quot;Good Omens,&quot; one of Gaiman's older works.<BR>It is a witty, humorous version of the apocalypse. I appreciate Gaiman &amp; Pratchett's knowledge and creative attempt at the subject...<BR>However the book is very long-winded and hard to get through...<BR>And watch out Americans, you may not get some of the British humor... i think i missed some of it.
B00005O5JV|5.0|It's disheartening to see all the reviews claiming the lead character 'Elle Woods' in LEGALLY BLONDE is \\"ditzy\\".  That is so far removed from the truth and I don't want possible buyers led astray.  So here's the real deal.<br />First and formost, this is NOT a movie about a \\"dumb blonde\\".  This movie is about the President of fictional sorority Delta Nu, who is a fashion merchandising major with a 4.0 grade point average.  She IS smart when it comes to her field of study and all surrounding subjects.  This is proved when she goes with her friends (one of whom, as a result of hanging out in nail salons, speaks fluent Korean!!) to buy the perfect dress for what she thinks will be the night her boyfriend Warner (Mathew Davis from Pearl Harbor) proposes to her.  The sales clerk of the botique, thinking Elle must be a dumb blond, tries to pass off an old dress with a propensity to snag as a one-of-a-kind original.  Elle quickly, and sweetly, let's her know she is NOT dumb, ditzy or willing to be taken advantage of.<br />When Warner breaks up with her because he needs a serious girl like the \\"Vanderbilt\\" one his brother is marrying, she is crushed.  But after noticing his soon-to-be sister in law is a law student, she has her plan; she too must attend law school!  And from there, we ride a roller coaster of Elle studying for the LSAT's, making her wonderfully inventive admissions video and doing what even Warner was not able to do...get into Harvard Law School On Her OWN Merits!<br />Along the way, we meet Vivian, Warner's new fiancee and Elle's competition, and a whole host of others who will be for or against Elle during her quest to win Warner back.  But after a crushing blow or two, Elle soon figures out that actual studying, faith and a seriousness she HAS ALWAYS possessed, is all she needs to survive and prove, Not To Warner, but to Herself, that she Does Indeed Belong at Harvard.  She isn't GIVEN a position as helper on a sensation murder case.  She EARNS IT with her outspoken and legally on point answers in class.  And goes on to prove that Cosmo girls with intelligence and someone who believes in them, can do anything.<br />This movie shows true intelligence, integrity and endurance wrapped up in a fluffy, child friendly \\"girl power\\" environment.  The fact that my 13 year old Son LOVED the movie says a great deal.  So don't believe this is another \\"dumb blonde\\" movie.  Reese Witherspoon has gained a fan for life in me with this triumphant trip to Harvard that far surpasses anything I've ever seen in the genre.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! :o)
0375703764|5.0|Awsome book (house).  Works on many levels.  What's the connection between levels?  That's for you to decide.  <BR>Try reading this one when you've just moved into a new house like I did.  This is a good one for insomniacs.
6301967992|5.0|Count Von Krolock(Ferdy Mayne), bears his fangs and licks his lips. His pale skin reveals that he has thirsted through out the winter months in transylvania, Romania and gives a chilling triumphant laugh. He says to both Professor Abronsius(Jack MacGowran), and his faithful assitant Alfred(Roman Polanski), ...&quot;I must leave you now..... See you later gentlemen....MEDITATE... on awaiting YOUR turn&quot;... Then leaves them prisoner at his gloomy castle to await his return later to.......<br />The Fearless Vampire Killers is a movie you will either love or hate, (I love it). If you like the idea of a european based, cold, snowy, winter where you rug up to a warm fire and heat your own hands with the breath that you huff from within your own lungs and listen to the locals gossip whilst enjoying a warm soup in the santuary of an Inn, then you will like this movie, trust me.<BR>If vampires, and comedy tied in with this, sound appealing, then The Fearless Vampire Killers is your movie. Abronsius and Alfred are travelling to transylvania to hunt down and destroy the vampire race that at this point only Abronsius and Alfred beleive in, but when they arrive at Shagal's(Alfie Bass), Inn then the truth of the village they are accomodated at is revealed, Shagal's daughter(Sharon Tate), is taken victim by Krolock and the two Fearless Vampire Killers set out to rescue her and ultimately mankind. Along the way they perform in a manner that is humourus and woefull. But this movie is not woefull. It is a smash hit that deserves much credit, as it has the &quot;feel&quot;, of an old Hammer Horror production with great laughs and a great cast.<BR>The perfect Friday night late movie with no lights on except the Television screen and a warm wood fireplace with just a random hint of crackle as the wood within burns...
B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams ended the 20th Century with a wonderful score that is probably my favorite. It encompases all the emotions that should generate from a soundtrack. The most notable and famous song being &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; and a lovely, romantic song called &quot;Anakin's Theme&quot; are my favorite. Although the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; contains all the music from the film, in order, I prefer this album's concert piece quality. I purchased this film score because I am a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan. But I soon became enamored with the music and have since purchased 12 Williams scores. I recommend this score to anyone who likes music, Star Wars, and/or film scores. This defines soundtrack in every way.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is quite possibly the best war film I have seen since Saving Private Ryan.  I just read a review by someone who said that the plot was \\"unbelievable\\" and that the characters were \\"unrealistic\\".  Well, that person should realize that these events REALLY HAPPENED and that the movie is based on Mark Bowden's book of the same name.  The actions taken by such men as Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon (the Delta Force operators who single handedly went in on a suicide mission to defend downed chopper pilot Mike Durand) were real events, but some people fail to recognize this and dismiss their heroic actions as the stupid macho crap that you get from any run of the mill Stallone movie.  If you truly want to appreciate what a brilliant job Ridley Scott did, than I would highly suggest reading the book first.  Ignorant people, like that reviewer, make me sick because they don't know that this story really took place on October 3, 1993, and that a lot of our guys actually fought and died over there.  The fact that they had some of the men who actually fought in the battle as consultants on the movie shows their true intention to keep the movie as \\"real\\" as possible.  The graphic combat depictions are terrifying and the plot exposition gives you just enough to know what is going on.  The ensemble cast did a brilliant job showing the fear and helplessness that some of the men felt, while at the same time showing the brave and selfelss acts that the men realized that they needed to do to survive.  The movie could have easily taken over three hours to show everything that happened, but Scott keeps it down to just over two hours.  The point that I really want to make is that everyone should see this movie to truly appreciate the sacrifice that our Special Forces (the Army Rangers and the Delta Force) made in Somalia.

0790731894|5.0|When one thinks of great movies there are a few that come to mind:  Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Godfather, and so on.  What never fails to amaze me is that Executive Decision is usually left out of this list.  What it lacks in plot it heavily makes up for in cast and character development.  Joseph Caanen and Orson Wells step aside; Kurt Russel and Steven Seagal are on the move.  If you want to talk about true chemistry amongst actors then I suggest you look no further than the \\"WERE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!\\"  \\"YOU ARE!\\" scene.  Lets just say that the ageold craft of theatre just got a tune up.  NINJA STYLE!  I don't like to judge others, but if your heart isnt racing faster than you love life itself by the last scene then you probably have little left to live for cause this movie is A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />I am still in the process of appealing the Academys 1996 decision [pun not unintentional] to give Best Picture to the English Patient.  And trust me you, we will not be that patient with them.  Regardless, if you are looking for a classic then reach for the nearest DVD copy of Executive Decision!
B00001OH7Y|4.0|David Bowie triumphs again on Scary Monsters, with its intense rock and roll, and overlaying, mostly disturbing themes.  As is often the case, the ensemble is broad--14 people are on the credits--and I can list all the influences...rock, soul, glam, disco etc. etc., but on to the songs......<br />Interestingly, the weakest track is the opener, \\"It's No Game,\\" more interestingly because it is reprised needlessly as a finale.  It is dominated by the wailing of David and a Japanese girl.  The disco song \\"Fashion\\" is from a genre I do not like, but its irreverent lyrics and (on occasion) funky sounds partially compensate.  The remainder is made up of seven very good songs, remarkably similar in quality, and mostly having a dramatic flair, except the title cut.  \\"Scary Monsters\\" is a straight rocker and a good one, in which David represents a difficult relationship by \\"scary monsters and super creeps,\\" backed by potent guitar work.<br />It's close, but the best song is \\"Teenage Wildlife,\\" on which the glam guitar cruises and David's singing is clearly most impressive.  His vocals are fabulous, rich and soulful and intense, and versatile--e.g., how about that switch to heavy in the \\"midwives to history\\" section, and then to high pitch?  David searches his soul in the elaborate, narrative lyrics.  \\"Scream Like A Baby\\" has a fairly average verseline, but with great tension leading into the chorus, as dramatic flourishes are dished out by terrific downward instrumental crescendos.  Also very dramatic are \\"Kingdom Come\\" and the two other strongest entries, the sentimental and highly evocative \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" and \\"Because You're Young,\\" where David swirls in \\"a million dreams.\\" <br />Is \\"Up The Hill Backwards\\" positive or downbeat?  The lyrics are negative and fatalistic except that the chorus tells you \\"Up the hill backwards, it'll be alright.\\"  But the music is very uplifting and spirited--David, just confuse us.  But actually, in a recording filled with themes like paranoia, drugs, hard times, and doom, the music, while intense, is uplifting in other spots as well.<br />I go for David more when he rocks hard and theatrically, over the softer/too-much-experimentation version.  I like Scary Monsters a lot, and it falls a microfraction below 4.5, just short of five stars.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Mulholland Dr. is one film you must see if you're a fan of the works of David Lynch. Through the first 3/4 of the film, you think you're watching a regular movie with a few odd scenes. Then, in the last quarter, you actually reallly have to use your brain to get into the film. If you're watching on auto-pilot, you'll just scratch your head and go &quot;Huh?&quot; by the time the credits roll.<br />Interestingly, this DVD has no chapter stops. I suppose it's to make sure you watch the movie in one sitting. This works to a disadvantage, since this is one film where you'd want to go back to particular scenes to look for clues as to what's happening.<br />I think the DVD packaging, which features two different cover designs featuring star Naomi Watts, can actually be taken as a clue as well.<br />Very intense. Very mind boggling. Very David Lynch.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I Think I was around 11 or 12 when Evil Dead was first released..The articles in Fangoria, the late-night TV commercials, the creepy newspaper ads....I had to see it! (Needless to say, I didn't....) My friend Bryan rented the tape (Beta!) when it came out, and we hunkered down for a midnight screening. It was everything I expected, and more! The perfect Horror movie.<br />  So how does it stand up almost 20 years later? Well....It's still one of the nastiest, most visceral Horror movies I've ever seen. It's easier to pick apart the cheesy acting and hokey dialogue and situations now, since I'm not 13 anymore. I think the other 2 movies in the Dead Trilogy are much better movies, more polished and professional, but the enthusiasm with which the film was made shines through, so it's hard NOT to get caught up in the spirit.........<br />  Director Sam Raimi has since gone on to become the closest thing Hollywood has to a renaissance man, directing virtually every genre of film: Western (The Quick & The Dead), Romance/Sports (For The Love Of The Game), Suspense (The Gift & A Simple Plan), and Superhero/Action (Darkman & now the eagerly awaited Spider-Man), but it all started here, with the small story of a group of friends in an isolated cabin who accidentally resurrect an ancient demonic force. The film is a non-stop thrill-ride, with the gore gushing freely throughout. The weak of Heart need not apply....<br /> The idea to package the disc in a \\"Book of the Dead\\" case is pure genius, and the case alone is worth the price. The disc itself is great; Chock full of extras, plenty of Easter eggs, 2 commentary tracks, both of which are hilarious AND informative, Galleries of art, photos, and promotional and advertising material, and a few GREAT documentaries. There's even a hidden make-up test and a hidden panel discussion. (Move that cursor along! You'll find 'em!) The transfer of the film is the best I've ever seen, and the sound is top-notch. There's also a great littlebooklet, as well as a fully illustrated Necronomicon, as seen in the movie. Just don't read it out loud. Especially in the woods. At night.......
B000035Z3K|2.0|The DVD of the English-language Bela Legosi version is FAR too compressed in my opinion. The picture is grainy and there is alot of digital \\"noise\\" (dithered pixelation in multi-hues). The image quality is not crisp but is rather dark and very fuzzy.<BR>The Spanish-language version, by contrast, is a much better picture, obviously sampled at a higher rate and with less compression. Why would the producers of this DVD spend more time (and valuable disk space) for the Spanish version of the film is beyond me! I mean, how many of you reading this would actually buy it for the obscure Spanish version versus the ultra-classic Bela Legosi version? Put the Spanish version on a separate disk next time, or on the flip-side and compress the main feature less.
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is so overlooked. Overlooked only because it had a completely different sound then SP's previous work. Isn't that what an album is supposed to be? something new and different from previous ones? Yes. Adore has a much more mature sound. some songs sound a little more techno-ish, most songs use a drum machine. All of the songs are either love songs or about Billy's mother's death. There is also use of many pianos, keyboards and interesting sounding beats. There are very upbeat and fun songs like \\"Ava Adore\\" and \\"Appels + Oranjes\\", there are just songs that give you a warm feeling such as my two favorites on the album, \\"The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete\\" and \\"Perfect\\", and haunting, epic piano playing like \\"For Martha\\", \\"Blank Page\\" and \\"Crestfallen\\". The Pumpkins make sure this is a full album with 15 songs, (one short filler) and it adds up to over 70 minutes. Pick it up now.
B00004TJLD|2.0|As a huge fan of the new DVD-Audio format I was really looking forward to hearing this disc. As it turns out this is not a   DVD-Audio disc but is instead, an audio only dvd or DAD disc. While it is a nice clean mix with utilization of center and surround speakers (sometimes) it does not make use of the sub at all. The sound is in no way comparable to a DVD-Audio disc. I do not think [this]is worth the minor improvements to the sound.
B00005OM4N|4.0|this cd has a lot of great songs that really makes you want to get up and dance. a lot of people dislike Britney Spears because of the way she dresses and her way of \\"inspiring\\" kids 10 years old but that shouldnt matter when it comes to music. i am sure if i played this cd to someone who has never heard of her, i am sure that person would love it- not knowing WHO was singing it. so i give this cd 4 stars for its great music!
B00005R62K|5.0|this is a great album from one of the first metal bands. i love all the songs on it. my favorites are the bonus song \\"Fire Burns Below\\" and the controversial classic \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\". For some reason amazon has not listed all of the songs on this cd, only five of them. There is really eleven songs, including the bonus tracks.
0440234743|5.0|People will pooh-pooh the ending and the jaded will say &quot;oh yeah, sure,&quot; but I dug this story.  After my second reading, I have to conclude that this is one of Grisham's best efforts.  Maybe I overidentify with Nate O'Riley, maybe I hunger for substantive spiritual goals, maybe I wish I had a friend like Nate's pastor buddy.  For whatever reason, this tale of fall and redemption with its fleshed-out supporting cast just really scratched my itch.  Give it a try, and let the taste get into you.
B000059XYM|1.0|The main problem with 'Scary Movie' is that it attempts to parody a movie that was already a parody - 'Scream'.  Whilst Scream reinvented the horror movie, 'Scary Movie' feels like a cash-in.  Indeed, even it's name is the original title for 'Scream'.  The plot is very simply: it's basically a rehash of recent horror movies, but in particular 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'.  A few other spoofs are thrown in their too, such as 'Sixth Sense' and 'The Matrix', to add to the mix.<br />Maybe this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't completely illogical and simply not funny.  The jokes are all as crude as they come, with sex and breaking wind seeming to be the main themes.  Although there's plenty here that might well have been a guilty pleasure every single joke is taken too far, especially an overlong death sequence where a pretty blonde girl does her best impression of Rose McGowan.  About half and hour into the movie you're already bored.  If you need to have seen the movies it spoofs then you already know the plots of them too, and as this simply apes them then there's nothing really here that will surprise you.<br />If you like gross-out comedy then maybe you'll like this, but American Pie and There's Something About Mary did it so much better.
B0000542D2|5.0|Though it is not truly a music video - at the same time it is.  As biographical as you can get, while also being a showcase of early songs for one of the greatest bands of all time.  Simply a fun movie to watch.
B00000DLVA|4.0|The Cardigans have come a long way since &quot;Lovefool&quot; and &quot;Been It&quot;. They were: 60s-sounding happy pop band who were darlings of radio and MTV in the late 90s. They are now: experimental, thoughtful, and a little edgier. Change is good. Without it, Alanis would still be playing the Nickelodeon audience. On Gran Turismo, The Cardigans get trip-hoppy; with a Portishead/Bjork feel, all done with the casualness of their lounge-pop days. Nina never sounded so jaded and beautiful, and on such in your face tracks like &quot;My Favorite Game&quot; and &quot;Hanging Around&quot;, she brings down the house. While the album doesnt break much ground, its quite accessible and worth a spin.Way too underrated, this is one band we may need to watch out for.
B00005RY7X|3.0|Ok. Im a huge punk rock fan. The only thing that really got a little old about this album or something that i didnt like, was that the guys voice is too aggressive for my normal tastes. he sounds too much like a heavy metal singer. not a lot of range. however, the guitars are filled with massive power chords with lots of crunch. pretty intense. although none of the songs really have any depth, they're fun to listen to. basically, when listening to some of the songs, especially the best songs, I Get Wet, Party Hard, etc., i end up thinking that what they sound like is if you crossed Def Leppard with the Misfits and threw in pop-punk chord progressions. Its a pretty good listen. Check it out.
B000002BQK|5.0|BUTTERFLY is Mariah Carey's best Album. There is absolutly NO FILLER on this album. In case you didn't know FILLER is a certain song that is so boring you just skip to the next one. It's not really listenable and gets irritating if you don't switch and keep on listening. As I stated earlier, there is NONE here. Each track is INCREDIBLE. If you liked the songs released on the radio (\\"Honey\\" #1, \\"My All\\" #1, \\"Butterfly\\", \\"The Roof\\" UK, and \\"Breakdown\\" featuring Bone Thugs 'n Harmony) then you'll love the rest. If you thought Mariah has gone Hip Hop with this album, think again! Rather, she incorporated soul R&B and pop...just like she usually does! There might be a hint of hip-hop in some places but other then that it's her same old-same old. My absolute favorite song on BUTTERFLY is the concluding \\"Outside\\" which was just incredible and is one of the album's highlights. Also noteworthy is the Missy \\"Misdamenor\\" Elliot-produced \\"Babydoll\\" which uses great harmonies with Hip Hop style beats (but is still however a slowish track). \\"Whenever You Call\\" is another noteworthy track and is one of her famous power-ballads. Also check out the same song but with Brian McKnight on \\"#1's\\"...it's just fabulous! I really REALLY reccomend this album to anyone who is a fan of Mariah's and enjoyed the songs released on the radio. My overall grade, A+ if there was a rating above that, that's what I would give BUTTERFLY. Hope I helped!!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|the army of darkness is the best of the evil dead trilogy even<BR>though its more of a comedy its still a quality film with some <BR>great laughs, Ash played by Bruce Cambell is a great charcter who <BR>really makes this film great, the film wouldnt be the same with out him. Also get the other 2 evil deads but they dont compare to<BR>this one so make sure you see this film.
B00001QEE6|4.0|One of the best Disney movies of it's era.  I saw it in the theatre as a child in the 1970's.  The digital transfer is amazing on this dvd!  It looks almost like they used a computer instead of hand drawings.  Great job on this one Disney!
0385474547|5.0|A thousand people have said this before me, but THINGS FALL APART is truly a wonderful piece of fiction.  From the first pages, you are immersed in a beautiful, strange (to me, anyway), fascinating culture that comes through in every description, in the words that come from the character's mouths, in the conflicts between individuals and the clash of cultures, and especially in Achebe's direct, articulate, sparesely beautiful style.  <br />As other reviewers have noted, it's usually not the best when you're being forced to read it for a class.  But look at it this way: most books aren't.  If you're in that situation, try to get past the coercion factor and the problem of grades, and read this book for yourself.  It's a &quot;classic&quot; -- that's why they're making you read it -- and no one hates &quot;classics&quot; more than I, but THINGS FALL APART is much, much more than a &quot;classic&quot; work of fiction. It is a tragedy, deeply felt, that draws an unerring portrait of human nature and especially human conflict. It is a good story, and one beautifully told.  It is an education you owe to yourself. And if that's still not enough: it's short.
B000063NPX|5.0|Disney's animated version of the classic tale, \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" is every bit as enchanting as the \\"tale as old as time\\" that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before. <br />Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told \\"if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.\\" <br />This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him. <br />Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation. <br />The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a long time. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal. <br />The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Pinocchio.\\" It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something. <br />This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels.<br />Be my guest, and see this movie.
B00005RFVL|5.0|When this album came out, I was thinking,&quot;what is this wacky fellow up to this time?&quot; Then i bought this album for the fun of it. Man I was impressed! When I heard the first opening track of this album, i counldn't recognised his voice. He sounded different and excellent! <br />All the tracks in this album is all classic made famous by big names like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Dean Martin and many more, except for the opening track &quot; I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen&quot; which is new and great too. If you think that the duet song with Nicole Kidman, &quot;Something Stupid&quot; was something, wait till you listen to the rest of the album! My personal fav would be &quot;Mr Bonjangles&quot; and &quot;Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me&quot;!<br />And I didnt know that names like Jon Lovitz and Rupert Everett could sing so well!<br />Another piece of advise, go get the DVD! Just watch how Robbie swings at the grand Royal Albert Hall!
B0000009S3|5.0|Famously labeled \\"the one album even people who don't like<BR>Frank Zappa like\\", but here's a twist--I like Frank Zappa<BR>quite a bit and I still consider this his finest achievement.<BR>Every track here is a complete winner, and there is no<BR>superfluous humour or bizarro filler which clutters up so<BR>many of his other works.  The one vocal, by Beefheart on \\"Willie The Pimp\\", is without a doubt the best on any FZ record<BR>ever (good vocalists being one thing Zappa always seemed a bit<BR>short on).  <br />Although there is a lot of jamming and improvisation here, this<BR>is not your ordinary jazz-fusion record.  There is a full symphonic sound and complexity to compositions like \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" and \\"Son Of Mr.Green Genes\\" which makes this a complete rock-jazz-classical fusion and presages a lot of prog rock<BR>to come.  And yet, in spite of the length of the tracks and<BR>the prevalence of long solos on \\"Willie The Pimp\\" and \\"Gumbo<BR>Variations\\", everything has focus, purpose and energy, and most<BR>importantly, rocks HARD.  The production here also sounds <BR>rich and full, something missing on contemporary Mothers albums of that period (the CD remix, which you will either like or hate, makes that sound even fuller--I actually prefer it).<br />A no-nonsense, mostly instrumental FZ album, filled with<BR>stunningly virtuosic playing, complex yet hummable tunes<BR>and a fresh, full sound.  One of the most famous works in his<BR>entire catalogue, and a must-purchase for fans and non-fans alike.  One of the best albums ever.
0345428064|4.0|This exciting book about a man called Nick Stone. He is sent on a mission to follow two irish suspects. Everything was going swimmingly untill he went to his friends house... <br />A great book with ups and downs a plenty. An exciting read with plenty of action yet not so much it ruins the book. A great book to read on journeys.
B0000009SF|5.0|Out of all of FZ's instrumental (or mostly instrumental) albums,<BR>&quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; comes second only to &quot;Hot Rats&quot; in quality.<BR>Its brand of jazz-fusion with classical and funk touches is similar to that of &quot;Hot Rats&quot;, although it is a bit lighter in<BR>tone and contains more horns and woodwinds.  The production sounds just as bright and full, however, and the tunes are equally memorable.  The funky &quot;Eat That Question&quot; is fueled by George Duke's stellar electric piano and organ work, which coalesce with Zappa's wah-wah guitar for some very tasty, quasi- psychedelic sounds.  The closing &quot;Blessed Relief&quot; is one of the most sensitive and poignant pieces in FZ's entire career, a soft, lilting light jazz number with a reverbed electric piano and soothing acoustic guitar work fit for late-night reminiscing. This album represents a peak for this particular<BR>style of Zappa's varied body of work, one which he would return to only in small doses for the rest of his career.  Highly<BR>recommended.
0930289331|5.0|Following the time after I read Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", whenever I hear the name \\"Batman\\", my mind immediately conjures up a vision of a lonely, troubled, ordinary man who, night by night, uses his detective skills to apprehend the criminals. He moves in the shadows and strikes fear into all those who are guilty and he. Never. Smiles.<br />Thanks to Miller, comic book writers proceeding after \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" have, for the most part, remained true to this vision. \\"Batman: Year One\\" is such an example and is truly a seminal body of work in the Batman canon.<br />\\"Batman: Year One\\" introduces us to two main characters, one being the aforementioned Dark Knight and the other being his most trusting friend and ally, (Lieutenant) James Gordon. The story is interwoven between these two men of Gotham City. Bruce Wayne has returned after having spent twelve years abroad with only one thing firmly rooted in his mind: to catch the bad guys. This desire runs parallel to (new cop in town) Gordon's own, in his case with addition to dealing with a corrupt police force.<br />Which is the beauty of this story. We see two men, one working for the law, and the other outside it, trying to come to terms with what they have to face. Gordon hates his job and corrupt superiors, regrets that his wife is bringing a child into this godforsaken city and has an affair to forget his troubles. Bruce Wayne/Batman on the other hand, has to come to deal with how he can strike fear into the hearts of men and maintain the image of a social elite at the same time. Something tells me they will get the hang of it.<br />Mazzuchelli's artwork is beautiful. Although I have always been a comic book fan, I've never really cared for the art unless it fails to help the story along. In this case, it does so much more. The art makes me feel totally uneasy with Gotham City, like I'm in Jim Gordon's place. It is perfect.<br />The most astounding feature of \\"Batman: Year One\\" is that it reads like adetective story and not a blockbusting special effects bonanza. Batman has always been a detective first and a \\"super-hero\\" second. He doesn't work like Superman, a character with whom comparisons are constant. It reminded me why I like him more than Superman: because he is, to all ends and purposes, only human. Miller keeps him that way which makes this a gritty and thrilling read.<br />I liked this book because it revived my interest in the Batman. I hear the film will be based on this story - I hope that the final script remains true to the detective aspect of \\"Batman: Year One\\", because it works best like that. The last two Batman movies were guilty of making Batman less mysterious. I want the real Batman back and if you read this book, you will too.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Redford &amp; Pitt make a great team.  Reford had the suspense and Pitt made the situation believable.  Looking forward to more movies w/the two of them teamed up.
B000063DHL|4.0|This CD is another wonderful CD of legendary NWOHM Band Iron Maiden !!!<br />Listen \\"Heaven Can't wait\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\" , and you'll see why these songs are in almost every Live Concerts of Maiden ....<br />Particularly I love \\"Deja Vu\\", It's melodics chords make me feel in another place in another world.....Really It's fantastic...<br />Also it's portrait is the best cover design of Maiden Albums....<br />I recommend !!!!!
B00005JLCI|5.0|Every other Hamlet incarnation is out there on DVD ... EXCEPT (and I do NOT understand this) the best one ever produced. Stunning cinematography, fantasticly original cast and the magic touch of Branagh. It is stunning and, now thanks to DVD, could be viewed at home in superior quality to the VHS release.<br />There is a queue waiting for this release and we want all the bells and whistles, if possible ... behind-the-scenes interviews, making-of, etc. ... but would settle for the widescreen show itself!!
B00005U1YO|4.0|Having not been a Chem. Bros. fan at all, for their entire career, I'll admit that I still downloaded this album from WinMix to give it a listen.  I must say they've converted me from hater to player.<br />Okay, maybe I overstated a bit, I didn't \\"hate\\" the Chemical Brothers but I only liked 'specific songs' that they've released throught thier career but their albums never warranted an entire listen from start to finish with me.    However recently while on a long trip I popped in my 'burned' version of the album and just coasted.<br />Normally after the first screechingly annoying sample or off beat break, I'd return from veg mode and have to switch CD's  immediately.  But when I put in this album, I never \\"came back down\\".  I spaced out and went somewhere private with the Chemical Brothers for the better part of an hour!  (hmmm.... why didn't that come out right?)  <br />Anyways, what I like about this album is that it's a bit of a break from their norm.  It actually sounds more like something William Orbit (70's guitar influences and all!) would put out that what the Chemical Brothers would do.  Unfortunately it seems to have alienated alot of their old fans.  Oh well, sometimes you just have to take a shot in the dark, grow some balls, and make new ones.<br />Oh yeah, I liked the album I burned so much that I had to go out and show love be actually paying for the thing so, hopefully, they'll make another!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Okay, first of all I never saw a David Lynch film until now.  I didn't realize his films were so complex and when I watched this 2 1/2 hour film, I thought to myself &quot;What was that&quot;?<br />So I went to a site that had movie spoilers and it explains why everything happened and that was the moment where I was blown away.<br />Lynch did a great job directing this film and Naomi Watts did a great job playing her &quot;characters&quot;.<br />I'm giving this film 4 stars because when I go to a movie or sit at home with my surround sound, I expect to understand the movie rather than get mad at myself for paying 3-8 dollars for seeing a movie I didn't get.  It was a good movie overall though.
6304346107|4.0|Absolutely wonderful adaptation.  If you have to pick an Emma, this is by far the best.<br />Emma is endearingly flawed.  She is perfect in her imperfections.  And she sometimes interferes where she shouldn't.  However, her intentions are always just and good from her point of view.  Kate Beckinsdale is perfect as Emma mainly because the other characters are perfectly cast.  Don't even imagine anyone else as Mr. Knightly!!! Mark Strong is perfect as Mr. Knightly in the way that Colin Firth is perfect as Mr. Darcy.  Enough said.<br />See this movie.  It's fun but also very touching as Emma discovers that the human heart is surprisingly difficult to understand.
B000002HH2|5.0|On this wonderful album you'll find some strong and powerful songs,  starting whit the opening track &quot; Army of me &quot; a very powerful song whit a strong lyric, some men may be a little scary of Bjrk because of her strong confident. <BR>The next song Hyper-ballad is a sweet but strange song, also whit a powerful lyric in it. And at last you'll find Possible Maybe a strong song and Bjrk really shows what a powerful voice she have.
B00005BCPC|4.0|I loved Fanny in this version.  She's more spunky than the book.  Plus, I enjoyed the way she plays to the audience so that you actually feel involved while watching the plot.  I'm afraid that I don't much like Edmund in the book or the movie.  He's much too wishy-washy.  I think that Fanny deserves better.  Other than that, it was very entertaining.  It's my third favorite Jane Austen's adaptation followed by the incomparable Pride and Prejudice and Kate Beckinsdale's Emma.
0767817710|3.0|Other than being a Sharon Stone vanity piece, this is okay.  Stone's performance actually winds up being the worst thing about the movie.  She plays Ellen (I don't know if she's actually named throughout the movie, but the box says Ellen), a drifter seeking revenge on the gang that killed her pappy.<br />She runs across a small western hamlet where the undertaker is the busiest man in town.  Herrod (Gene Hackman) has the town in an iron grip.  As a coincidence, Herrod is the leader of said gang.  To top it all off there is a gunfighters tournament with a crazy assortment of characters dueling to the death.  The supporting cast is a who's-who of before-they-were-stars.  Gary Sinise, pre-Lt. Dan, as Ellen's father.  Leonardo DiCaprio, pre-Titanic, as \\"The Kid\\".  Russell Crowe, pre mug-shot, as the preacher (!).  <br />I guess Stone's performance wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't directly ripped from Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name Trilogy.  Also, Crowe seems to be playing the same stoic put-upon character and doing a better job of it.  Lance Henrikson is the main standout as \\"Ace\\".  He puts an ace in his deck for every man he kills.  That's pretty cool.  I was hoping for him to make the finals, but it was not to be.<br />If you like traditional westerns this probably isn't for you.  If you like Sam Raimi's loopy direction (you can see through the bullet hole in someone's skull at one point) you'll want to pick this one up.  If you're looking to see what a lot of these actors were doing before they \\"made it\\" you could do a lot worse.<br />Recommended for fans of quirky movies, but not for fans of traditional westerns.
068484267X|3.0|Angela's Ashes is a gloomy, yet humorous, biography about growing up from the eyes of a child during the depression era in Brooklyn, NY and Limerick, Ireland. The story explains what it was like living during this time in poverty, while captivating the reader with vivid imagery and detail. <BR>\\" From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetation. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes and spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of pee wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many man puked out his weekly wages.\\" (p. 12)<BR> Angela's Ashes begins in Brooklyn, NY where Frank McCourt was born to Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan. His parents were both Irish immigrants. Frank McCourt writes about his very early childhood stories in New York such as when his family had to sleep in a. Frank, along with his three brothers, his sister, and his Mom and Dad, soon move to the slums of Limerick, Ireland, in hopes of finding a better life back home as well as a well earning job. <BR>Life wasn't nearly as easy as they expected back in Ireland. Frank's mother Angela, a depressed mother, has little money to feed her children. Frank's father, Malachy, rarely worked because of his drinking problem. When Malachy finds a job, he immediately drinks his weekly wages away. Frank and his family have to survive and live through appalling and dire living conditions. They are forced to live in a flat so miserable that every year Frank's family had to pack themselves into one upstairs room when even the winter floods made the first floor unlivable. \\"The upstairs room was \\"Italy\\" because it was warm and dry and downstairs was Ireland, for it was wet and cold.\\" (p. 96) <BR> Though life may have been depressing for Frank's family, Frank finds humor in his miserable daily life. The book follows Frank McCourt through the pre-mature deaths of his brothers and a sister, his depressed mother, and the sacrifices she makes to feed and shelter her family. It also highlights his adventures with his Catholic school friends, and at his Catholic school brought on by a strict teacher who convinced him of damnation if he did not perfectly behave. Angela's Ashes highlights a number of jobs that Frank has to help aid his family upon the departure of an alcohol-enslaved father, such as working for a poor Englishman who is handicapped, and finally his own departure to start a life of his own back in America.<BR>\\" When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood; the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic Childhood.\\"  (p. 11)<BR>The answer is clear how Frank McCourt survived through his childhood. Frank McCourt finds humor through everyday life. Although Frank shows anger towards his father many times throughout the book, he loved to hear his father's stories. Frank lived to hear his father's tales of the Angel on the Seventh step, which brings his mother's babies and Cuchulain, the hero who saved Ireland. <BR>Frank McCourt tells his story honest and realistically. Though there isn't a clear climax, after Frank is dropped from his current job, he has to beg for any food or money he can obtain. Frank is near starvation, he is cold, has no shelter, and even catches typhoid fever.  But Frank's dream of moving to America is not ruined because of his near-death situation. Will Frank ever be able to live a healthy life back in America?<BR>Unlike other biographies or non-fiction books I have read, Frank McCourt right his story as it was. Proper English is <BR>Angela's Ashes is by far the best book I have ever read. Though Frank McCourt may have had a distressing childhood, he uplifted the book with his unique and enjoyable humor. His writing is hilarious. I chuckled at even the little things. Frank described his threats of eternal damnation because of the naughty things he thought of in his boyhood. I was uplifted by Frank's hopeful perspective of life and his funny little anecdotes of his childhood. My favorite anecdote was when Frank and his brother try on their parent's fake teeth, and Franks brother get sent to the hospital to get the removed. The ending of the book was not as captivating as the rest of the book. It was long and tedious as it described Frank's job as a telegram deliver. <BR> Frank McCourt shares with his readers an honest, vividly detailed, and humorous memoir of his childhood. This is a fascinating book that I would recommend for ages 13- through adulthood. As I finished the book with an uplifted spirit, I was blown away by the reality of what it was like growing up in Irish Catholic poverty. It definitely taught any reader to not take things for granted. Angela's Ashes is truly an incredible and marvelous book.
0783229364|4.0|I think a good test of how good or bad a movie is, is by how long it feels.   Some 90 m.  movies feel like three hours and vice versa.  Secret of My Success feels like a half an hour.  That's pretty good.<br />Brantley moves from Kansas to NYC in order to make it in the corporate world.  Problem: he gets laid off even before he starts.  He's a trooper, though, and doesn't want to run home with his tail between his legs so he goes to his Uncle Howard for a job.  It's not exactly what Brantley envisioned as he is stuck in the mailroom.  Using corporate bureaucracy  against itself, he manages to swing a job as a vice-president.  It gets pretty funny from there as Brantley tries to maintain two identities without being found out.  The elevator scenes are priceless!<br />This movie is the definitive eighties comedy.  Michael J. Fox gets to showcase his screwball comedy antics and the rest of the cast is equally fine.  Helen Slater stands out as a female executive that manages to break through the glass ceiling only to be pressed up against it and fondled by the smarmy CEO.  \\"Auntie Vera\\" is also a hoot as the sex-starved wife of Uncle Howard.<br />The DVD doesn't offer too much in the way of extras, but that's okay because the movie alone is worth having on disc.  Get this one right away.
B00005KA9G|1.0|THE FULL MONTY is a movie buff's test of credibility.  It doesn't have the suspense to carry on as a drama.  If it is a comedy, the film is a one joker. It is predictable to the nth. Scene A: We're off, we're going to get going with our nude revue--oh! oh! there is a problem that we have to sort out with one of the guys who is going to back out of dancing in the nude and that's funny! Scenes B,C,D etc. : Same as Scene A with a different guy ad predictalitum. What ever happened to those good British comedy story writers who gave us Wrong Box and Ladykillers?
B000007T2Z|5.0|The album - helpfully titled f#a#* - was strikingly cinematic, recalling Ry Cooder's soundtrack to Paris, Texas and Terrence Malick's films Badlands and Days Of Heaven. Their style of splicing tape recordings of the angry disenfranchised and the mutterings of militias into their music echoes '60s libertarian outsider counterculture. Their use of &quot;authentic&quot; instruments, field recordings, downhome folk forms, and lo-fi acoustic Americana, meanwhile, places Godspeed in the canon of maverick North American folk-artists that includes archivist Harry Smith, composer/carpenter Harry Partch and singer Tom Waits. Yet they produce more self-consciously beautiful, solely instrumental music than those artists, and arguably also lack their humour and warmth. Most of their songs follow the same formula: start slow and quiet, then go really fast and loud. It's certainly true that much of their music is based around dynamic sonic crests and swells, but the sheer scale of their thunderously loud sound means they generally get away with it. Godspeed You Black Emperor! are certainly unique in modern rock music. Instrumental music with traces of contemporary classical is rarely drooled over, but Godspeed's alternative idealism, combined with the sonic assault of a Japanese noise band, makes for a strangely seductive proposition.<br />The name, incidentally, comes from a Japanese biker gang. Or rather, a translation of &quot;Buraku Empororu&quot;, a film by Japanese director Mitsuo Yanagimachi.
B000009QOC|5.0|This is probably the best Danzig record in my oppinion.Every song is great.Danzig has one of the best voices in music.His voice sounds a lot like Elvis Presley on a few tracks-like blood and tears and a few other as well.I hope his new album Danzig 777 I Luciferi will sound similer to this,but it will probably sound more like Danzig 666 satatns child.
B00005R2M3|5.0|So Shakira died her hair blonde.  So what?  You shouldn't think about what people look like when you buy their music.  You should buy CD's because you like the music. <br />Anyway, this is a very good CD.  It always surprises me that Shakira had to teach herself English.  She sounds like she's been speaking it her whole life.  It is this fact, along with her having written or co-written all of the songs on this album, that make her a role model.  And, as it is boasted on the back, the entire album was produced by Shakira.<br />The songs on this album are as follows:<BR>1)OBJECTION (TANGO)- Very upbeat with fun lyrics and a catchy chorus<BR>2)UNDERNEATH YOUR CLOTHES- The second single off of the album.  A ballad with a beautiful tone.<BR>3)WHENEVER, WHEREVER- The first single off of the album; pop- rock classic<BR>4)RULES- My least favorite song; it is good but I don't like the message<BR>5)The One- A very pretty love song with a referance to buying thongs<BR>6)Ready for the Good Times- Fast paced and fun with potential as a club classic<BR>7)Fool- Another ballad with nice lyrics<BR>8)Te Dejo Madrid- The first Spanish song; even if you have no idea what she is saying it is still fun and I have found myself singing along<BR>9)Poem to a Horse- A cross between a ballad and a rocker<BR>10)Que Me Quedes Tu- A ballad<BR>11)Eyes Like Yours- The English version of a song off of Shakira's last album; fast paced<BR>12)Suerte- Fun to hear Whenever, Wherever in Spanish<BR>13)Te Aviso, Te Anuncio- The Spanish version of Objection<BR> <BR>Very, very good!!
6304457391|4.0|This is a fine movie about the cold war.  The interesting thing is that the bad guy was right -- General Scott anticipated the (fictional) cheating of the Soviets.  The problem was Scott was willing to overthrow the constitution to keep the USA from being at a disadvantage.  A nice foil for every American to think of -- as another reviewer pointed out, the ends do not justify the means.<br />The book is more complex, more developed, but it also is more verbose and posturing.  And it doesn't have Burt Lancaster -- perfectly cast as the dangerous, charismatic Gen. Scott.  The other casting is okay -- Kirk Douglas was too aggressively likeable as Jiggs, and Ava Gardner was too old for a broken hearted Washington ingenue.  But maybe my opinions are a product of modern cinema where everyone is 22.<br />So go on down to your 1950's era bomb shelter and check it out.
0441003257|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books.  Hilariously funny, it tells the story of the Anti-Christ (totally spoofing &quot;The Omen&quot;) except Heaven and Hell screw up and lose track of him.  They start watching the wrong kid, while off in a different town, the Anti-Christ is happily growing up a normal little boy.  The Apocalypse is coming, and by the time the Powers That Be (in the form of an angel and a demon--who, by the way, are friends) realize their mistake, they rush off to fix it, only to get in more and more trouble.  A wonderful, wonderful book.
B00004XQ83|5.0|As soon as i saw this movie, i started thinking of buying the OST - some of the songs 'grip' you instantly, like 'A man of constant sorrow', which is kind of the showpiece of the movie and OST.<br />But there are also many others which one likes straightwaway, and yet others that grow on you.<br />And if you've seen the movie, there's the added pleasure of recalling the scenes accompanied by the songs while listening.<br />There are songs to sing along, songs to soothe you, songs to make you smile and to lift your spirits - what more could one ask for ??<br />Oh, and some of the songs are available for download from Amazon, even if from different artistes, as are different songs from the artistes featuring on the OST. I quite enjoyed what i downloaded :-)<br />Anyways, this is definitely one of the best soundtracks, in fact one of the best albums of any kind that i've heard.<br />Recommended without reservations !!
B00005JKJA|5.0|The term, Post-Modern, is often misused or overused. In this case it is right on the mark.  Lynch has created a post-modern masterpiece.  <BR>  <BR>  This film relates to Gilles Deleuze's  post-modern concept of the Rhizome.  &quot;A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing.  Where are you coming from?  What are you heading for?  These are totally useless questions.  Making a clean slate, starting or beginning again from ground zero, seeking a beginning or a foundation - all imply a false conception of voyage and movement (a conception that is methodical, pedagogical, initiatory, symbolic...).&quot; ('A Thousand Plateaus,'  written by: Deleuze  + Guattari)<BR> <BR> Lynch fabricated characters that were coming and going, rather than starting and finishing.
B0000636UN|4.0|This is a very cool CD. While Sheryl doesn't break a lot of new ground with this offering, it is consistent with her previous releases. There is a lot to enjoy here, and the guest appearences from Sheryl Crow And Friends continues. Here are some of the highlights:<br />1. Steve McQueen - This is one of those songs that the more you listen to it, the more you like it.  It's a great song to drive to.<br />2. Soak Up The Sun - This song is very catchy. It reminds me of All I Wanna Do.  The guest vocals from Liz Phair at the end add a nice touch.  There are also nice harmonies in the chorus.<br />3. You're An Original - Lenny Kravitz guests on this track.  He is used in moderation on the chorus, and I think it works really well.<br />4.  Diamond Road - Here, Sheryl gets philosophical on us.  This is a slower song where she tries to tell us not to let the good things in life pass us by.  It's one of my favorites on the CD.<br />5. It's So Easy - This is one of those songs that the more you listen to it, the more you hate it.  I can understand Sheryl wanting to do a song with Don Henley, but this falls short of what both are capable of.<br />7. Safe And Sound - This song was first heard on America: A Tribute To Heroes. Written before the events of 9/11, it took on new meaning and was very powerful when she performed it at the benefit concert.<br />10.  Abilene - Natalie Maines is the guest on this song.  It is kind of a twangy country/rock song.  I find it relaxing and very easy to listen to.<br />If you enjoyed Sheryl's other CD's, you will enjoy this one.
1572810408|4.0|I can certainly understand why others rave over this deck's beauty --- the art here is certainly a cut above that of the typical, hastily-put-together ... decks created by lesser tarot artists out for a quick profit. Kneen's illustrations have a wonderful clean crisp breezy feel, devoid of any unnecessary garishness. You could gaze into the pictures for a long period without fatiguing your eyes. Wonderful.<br />I have one major problem with this deck's design. This is Kneen's assertion that the old Marseilles-style decks inspire her the most, but yet she chooses to switch the numberings of the Strength and Justice card to the nasty Rider-Waite abberation (Strength=8, Justice=11). This completely crosses her deck out of contention for serious use as a Marseilles-alternative in my colllection. Also, fine as her artistry is, she seems to to have big trouble sketching the backs of human hands. All the hands of the people in the cards lack the fine detailing of *fingers*. The result is that, for me personally, these people look less like humans, and more like lifeless Pinocchio-like puppets. EERIE.<br />That said, this deck is still very much a visual feast and deserves a spot in the collection of any avid tarotist.
B00001NFCY|5.0|All the tracks on this wonderful CD deserve a listen. Are you ready was great till he started counting down, what if is just something you listen to when you feel like hittin' somethin', Beautiful just blows you away, say i is one of the weaker ones but still a great song( does anyone else hum along with this song). Wrong way takes a sec to get used to it but then it's one of the best, faceless man is the ultimate and will never be beaten by any creed song or any others. Never die is packed with emotion and fantastic lyrics, WAWO is amazing even if overplayed and higher can rock any party. Wash away those years really grows on you if you give it a chance and inside us all is just amazing for all reasons. Buy it.
B00005NW02|5.0|Although I did not hear their first album, I still can tell a good album when I hear one. I first heard  Chop Suey from a friend, as he was humming it. I liked it, and then heard toxicity on the radio. Then, I knew I needed this. Toxicity has a really great guitar part, accompanied with great sounding drums. And, to show their musical ability, Toxicity is written in 12/8 Time Signature.
0792160347|5.0|Richard Gere is remarkable as a Male Prostitute in this gritty, but glamorous protrayal of a fella that's lookin' for love in all the naughty places!<br />I like the crime story element much more than the love story between Mr. Gere and Ms. Hutton...But mostly I like that a typically female role (especially in main-stream cinema) was played by a great leading male. <br />Recommend this as a Double Feature with Pretty Woman (although I'm not a fan of Pretty Woman for film sake...it's good to see Richard turn the tables on his life...Imagine it as a Prequel to Pretty Woman. It'll give the storyline a whole new spin!!)
B000063TNH|5.0|Like I stated in the title of my view, it makes you think.  Drug trafficking is a heavy subject matter to deal with in a movie format.  The filmmaker successfully blended 3 separate story lines together using different color lightings and various degrees of handheld camera moves to present it as a docu-drama.<br />This is a very intelligent movie dealing with the drug problem we all face in our society.  Drug problem is not far removed from our seemingly 'sheltered' suburban environment and middle class surroundings from the ghettos where it 'should'  belong to.  I wish all those who care about this problem's social, economical, moral, emotional, and health impacts would watch this movie and think about any possible improvement in dealing with this situation.<br />After the movie, my hats off to all the drug control rank-and-files that do their job daily even though it seems fruitless and wasteful.  Like Mr. Topher Grace's character said in the movie: as long as there's demand, there's a supply.  There seems to be no stopping from dealers at different levels of distribution to supply the buyers out there.<br />Mr. Del Torro showed a commanding performance as a Mexican cop.  He reminds me of Mr. Chou Yun-Fat in John Woo's cop movies in his Hong Kong days.  All the characters are uniformily strong and even.  There's no weakest link in this ensemble.  I don't want to name all of them because it's simply too many.  But you will know what I mean after finishing this movie.<br />Mr. Soderbergh deserved his best director Oscar.  Keep up the great work, Mr. Soderbergh!
B00005QDW5|2.0|No Run Like Hell and Young Lust from THE WALL? Welcome To The Machine and Have A Cigar excluded from WISH YOU WERE HERE? And finally, Speak To Me/Breathe In The Air, Brain Damage and Eclipse ignored like DARK SIDE OF THE MOON was just another contract obligation. I appreciate this isn't an all-inclusive box set, yet with digital technology advanced the way it is most of the above songs I am sure could somehow have been granted extra space onto this anthology. I don't want to advise you to do something you don't want, but as an associate customer you might try to forget this compilation and instead take another listen to those songs/other hits from their original discs. This way you not only could get the recordings but best of all you give yourself the chance to hear others without any been given the re-mix. Pink Floyd was always a progressive band in their own right and never something a couple of CD's could accurately represent them with. If you were born in the mid-60's or earlier or even if that was before your timeline, again I recommend you recognize the Floyd studio discs their big hit songs first were introduced from and give them their deserving respectful listen before thinking only half a dozen cuts are missing from this memory-listing. Better to do that before taking any hit gathering as replacement for a band's entire history...
1558908382|5.0|I don't usually gush about actors.  They are worth praising when they do the character right.  But after watching 4 of Mr. Cusack's movies back to back, I have to say that he is one cool cat!!  In this movie, he had to walk a fine line between being too cool or too labored.  He's neither.  As a hit man, he is still able to portray emotions as an everyday man seeking meaningful relationships.  But when the profession calls for action and precision, he's totally capable.<br />This comedy succeeded in many levels: 1. great balance in mixing genres, 2. chemistry between characters, 3. comical talents of its cast members, and 4. the pace the filmmaker set.<br />If you were looking for 'black' or 'quirky' (hate to label it this way) comedy, this is it.  If you were remotely interested in Mr. Cusack, Miss Driver, Miss Cusack, or Mr. Akroyd's work, this is it.  The least you can do is to rent it and form your own opinion.
0451450523|2.0|I don't know what all the hype is about over this book.  It reads like a drawn out bedtime story which takes place in a world with no substance or history.  It seems like the author just threw everything together, then made things up as he went along.  When I finished, I found myself thinking: What was the point to this story?<br />The plot was as patched together and senseless as a dream.  I think I could have spent my time better than to read this book.
6305128952|4.0|The movie received mixed reviews during its theatrical run so I did not bother to see it.  When I finally saw it on DVD, I have to say that this movie is very un-Hollywood.  Mr. Redford as a filmmaker and a conservationist, made an ode to Montana sky and the ranch horses that rule the land.  Regardless you love horses or the country scenery or not (me being a big city kind of girl), you will feel the love and care Mr. Redford lavished on his favorite subjects.<br /><br />The horse Pilgrim, after his devastating accident, is heartbreakingly portrayed.  There's nothing fun about seeing an emotionally and physically wounded animal struggling to adjust and to deal.  I've never been big on horses but it breaks my heart to see it on film.  Same can be said about the character Grace, the way she had to deal with being a teenager and an amputee at the same time.  It's a lot for either of them to handle.  The emotional roughness portrayed by them in a parallel way was very hard to take while watching it.<br /><br />As for the ending, if you really listened to Sam Neil's speech to Miss Scott Thomas (his wife in the movie), you'd realize why she makes the decision she made.  It's not an easy task for a middle-aged woman to decide on choosing the passion of the moment or choosing the long-standing support of a devoted husband.<br /><br />This movie and its pace are for audience who appreciate details, subtle emotions, natural settings, simplicities, and animals.  If Pearle Harbor and Con Air were your kind of movies (not that there's anything wrong with them), you may not want to sit through this one.  :)
B00000K44W|4.0|Imagery has long been a staple of Tull music; who hasn't pictured the park where Aqualung hangs out or the aristocratic buffoons parading through Thick As A Brick.  Heavy Horses, a commercially underrated effort, re-enforces Ian Anderson's craftsmanship as storyteller and musician, sort of a cross between J.K. Rowling and the Pied Piper. Self indulgence and seriousness pervade most progressive rock efforts of late but through the years Tull has never lost it's sense of fun and playfulness even when wagging a cynical finger at the audience.  Heavy Horses is an example good musicians having a good natured frolic in the fields.
0385505833|1.0|This book is not up to John Grishman quality.  Although it was actually interesting throughout the first 3/4 of the book, after that it really tapers off.  The last part of the book really drops off and makes it worse.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I've read and heard some bad reviews about this movie.  I dissagree with every one of those people.  I think people now a days don't like to think about what they are watching.  They enjoy less thought provoking movies like lets just say, oooh, like summer catch. (which I have seen, why God, why!)  I think people like to have their movies wrapped up in a cute little bow at the end of a film.  Which is fine, wonderful, but accept a bold move when a film maker decides to be creative.  Many have opened minds before lynch, yes he's not the first but he created an extraordinary film!  Worth buying and watching 10 times, and then watching it again.  It truly is hypnotic.  If you are in the mood for some of the best scenes (many scenes have beautiful lesbians, hilarious comedy, and good old what just happened here in this...type of scenes.) I've never seen a million times before, then this is it. Check it out.
B00000ILE7|4.0|this film seems like common sci-fi/horror fare but in truth it is dense and incredibly symbolic. for me it evokes plague, (particularly the bodies on the wooden cart following the<BR>explosion) and something akin to stigmata, a foreshadowing of ripley's growing connection with the creature (during the eulogy and birth of the alien when a trickle of blood escapes from her nose) <BR> and there is such an air of claustophbia about the picture which is one of the great hallmarks of the series. it is difficult to compare the films, even though all of them are tense and isolated, but i can say it should have ended there-the last film being stylish and aesthetically pleasing but ultimatley without the fire and dread of the first three.
B00005QDW5|5.0|To sum this album up will be hard, but I'll try:<BR> <BR>Fahgnus#sumwumjuoof%lasaxhibza*axm&nwquackaholla$yoo!!!!!<br />There is no other way to really describe the greatness of this greatest of greatest hits albums. Although many Pink Floyd classics are missing, most notably \\"Run Like Hell\\" and the parts 8 and 9 of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" many rare and old Floyd tracks are present. The 2-disc set tries to capture the 'Pink Floyd story' and manages to tie all the tracks together so they flow into one another. My favorites are all here, \\"Brick In The Wall Pt.2\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Learning To Fly\\". Pick it up if you are new to Pink Floyd or a long-time veteran. You'll enjoy it either way. Look at MY reaction above!
B000002KAT|5.0|Perhaps one of the most misunderstood pieces of modern music upon its release in 1968, \\"Astral Weeks\\" has stood the test of time to be hailed as a classic. Concieved to be listened to as a complete song cycle, it weaves and digs deep into the pschic. If your just discovering Van I would suggest starting with \\"Moondance\\" or \\"Band and Street Choir\\", then after getting aquanted purchase \\"Astral Weeks\\" and be prepared to travel<br />\\"Between the viaducts of your dream Where immobile steel rims crack And the ditch in the back roads stop Could you find me?\\"
B0000636UN|5.0|From her first album through The Globe Sessions, I am a major fan of Sheryl Crow.  After a couple delays, her new album is finally here and it is a winner overall!!!!  From the catchy first track STEVE MCQUEEN to her winning first single, SOAK UP THE SUN.....I knew I would like the album!!!  Each track is different than the one before.....she has Lennie Kravitz help her out on the rocking YOU'RE AN ORIGINAL...the standout tracks are SOAK UP THE SUN, C'MON C'MON, IT'S SO EASY (WITH DON HENLEY), LUCKY KID, DIAMOND ROAD, IT'S ONLY LOVE and ABILENE.  It amazes me how Sheryl Crow continues to mature as a songwriter and stylist....this album is yet another example that \\"all she wants to do is have some fun\\".  \\"C'MON C'MON\\" and join in her party!!!  The album has ballads, rockers, guitar riffs, etc......it is great!!!!
B0000636UN|4.0|What a wait it has been! It seems like forever since she released her splendid last album \\"The Globe Sessions\\" to be exact it's 3 1/2 years ago. So the question that was on top of my mind as I slid the disc into the player was how much have these years changed her style? And the answer is: not that much - but enough to notice a difference - enough to seem refreshed. Let's take a look at what separates this album from \\"The Globe Sessions\\". In short I'd say it's more of an up tempo album, the sound itself has changed and the production as well. <BR>Looking back at her self titled album it was also more up tempo then \\"the Sessions\\" but in my opinion (and here's where the sound comes in) it \\"rocked\\" more. What I mean is the rough guitars where more apparent in the mix the sound itself seem dryer and could be defined as more of a rock sound. This I believe comes from the fact that \\"C'mon C'mon\\" has been mainly mixed by Andy Wallace (who mixed 4 tracks on Sessions as well) and not Tchad Blake as her previous two albums were. IMO this is the biggest difference - and I miss Sheryl's old sound. Don't get me wrong the album's mixed beautifully but being a fan of Blakes I did like what he did for her bringing out some edge and I miss it - I guess it comes down to tastes really. And I do also see the idea in trying out a new sound.<BR>As for the production- I'd describe it as more of a pop production - it's filled with drum programming and is more \\"refined\\". It seems less simplistic than her previous work and the acoustic guitar doesn't get as much room on this one as on the other albums (again this could be because of the mix). <BR>But Crow is still the same in many aspects. The same basic Sherules still apply: Great melodies, beautiful harmonies and chord progressions, an overall great vocal deliverance and classy and well placed riffs are all over this album. The album also has the slow burner song know from \\"the Sessions\\" as \\"Crash and Burn\\" - here it's emotionally and beautifully delivered as \\"Weather Channel\\". Another standout song would be \\"Safe and Sound\\" which also features a small Sheryl scream - she goes all out on this one and I love it. <BR>There's no doubt the album's full of great melodies and emotions I always thought the sound of her voice paints a thousand words and her lyrics for me are somewhat a filler.<BR>To conclude - this is an album for both Crow fans and newcomers. It's a \\"classic\\" Crow record just with more pop elements. And I am sure it will grow on me even more. Do yourself a favor and buy it! And while you're at it buy \\"the Globe sessions\\" and her self titled album if they aren't already flattering your cd collection.
B0000636UN|5.0|The lastest Cd from Sheryl Crow, &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; is a VERY GOOD!, album, from start to finish this album is very well put together.  I just listened to it and there is not a bad song on it.  The first single &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;(which took all of 1 second for me to like), is a very upbeat song, and also very easygoing.  Sheryl's voice is at or near it's best on this album.  There are 13 songs on this CD, and all of which could be hits.  There are a couple of songs that are already favorites of mine.  Some of the songs that I like are &quot;The Lucky Kid&quot;, which has a very different sound to it,  &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;, and the very emotional charged &quot;Safe And Sound&quot;(which in my opinion should be the next single).  But all of the songs from this album are good.  I was so looking forward to this albums' release and now I can see why.  This album will be played alot in my CD, it's just that good.  This album get an A++, from me because, well there is nothing else to give it, and if there isn't, at least one #1 song from this album then something is wrong.

B000002GF8|5.0|First off, \\"Mother\\" is certianly one of the most disturbing and funny songs I have heard to date.This song and \\"Dreamhome Heartache\\"-Roxy Music. I honestly like every song on this album. My favorite is actually not a popular one \\"Miss Gradenko\\". My second would be \\"Walking in your footsteps\\" then \\"Tea in the Sahara\\". I of course like the popular ones like \\"Wrapped around your finger\\" and \\"Synchonicity II\\". I would recommend and do to anyone who likes Sting's solo music to buy this album. A great album extremely creative and it's one I never get tired of. Worth the five stars!

B000055X3U|5.0|Many people whom own this album call it....depressing, quiet, moodfilled, and serene. All are correct. But add, inspirational, soothing, and well...phenomenal. \\"Despair\\" gives a look from someone who is utterly alone, and tragically damned to remain in this life after loosing a loved one. The opening track beautifully begins with a serene chorus-guitar line and when the full band blasts...perfection. All of the vocals are completely understandable and the musical is not speed metal but not pansy-lightweight stuff. (a very imporant aspect to me). Overall the entire album is nothing less than a dark, musical nirvana.
0316776963|3.0|I imagine that, in person, David Sedaris is an absolute crackerjack storyteller.  He has a gift for nuance and detail; unfortunately, in written form his stories seem to lack backbone.  Throughout the entire book, I kept feeling as though a dimension was missing -- that the essays needed some animated hand gestures or verbal emphasis, to complete them.<br />&quot;The Youth in Asia&quot;, a long drawn-out paean to his family's pets, is not nearly as interesting as he thinks it is, and &quot;I Almost Saw this Girl Get Killed&quot; is almost interesting... but not quite.  The other essays were better, but only the first one, &quot;Go Carolina&quot; was laugh-out-loud funny.
0807014265|5.0|Please consider Viktor Frankl and his wonderful books with me for a fewe moments in time. The reason I edited in Psychology and against Psychiatry and Analysis was the same as the reasons of the great doctors of Europe had. Analysis made people cabable of doing things and of pleasure instead of living, adapting, and even being able to suffer and triumph over it. This is not a tautology at all. \\"Pleasure\\" and \\"doing\\" are the parts of life that rudimentary psychologies, as still exist in alleged \\"depth\\" and analytical psychology still do to the limited extents that it still survives and continues to damage human beings.<br />It is time to reconsider the books and thoughts of the great European born and internationally famous and revered Doctor and Existential Psychologist Viktor Frankl, who wrote \\"Artzliche Seelsorge,\\" or \\"The Doctor and the Soul\\" and \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" I was recently appalled that the life and work of Viktor Frankl contradicted every single thing a very bright and wonderful person whom I \\"met\\" on-line over two years ago, and later in person is and has been doing for many years in addition to getting support, conditional acceptance, and aquiescence from all family and friends for their behaviors and lifestyle. <br />I became greatly concerned when I was trusted and admitted into the home of this fine person and discovered that they had never had much of a home at any time, but indeed had a very rich work life. This person had actually ceased to exist at all at home during the previous five years. Much of Europe supports this sort of existence, and certain countries there<br />This life completely contradicts and inverts what FRANKL who survived the entirety of Auschwitz and other places like it from 1939-45 says it NOT the way to do things. Instead of being outraged at their \\"help\\" playing psychological detective instead of helping them to find real meaning in life versus being emotionaly cold and inwardly dead. Frankl and others I worked with as a very young person in the early 1960's took a sense of compassion and concern born of their experiences much like Frankl's with the Nazi world, and of Ratibor Jurjevich with the communists after the war and Nazi invaders during it.<br />The entirety of the second chapter of \\"The Doctor and the Soul\\" deals with the movement from psychoanalysis to existential analysis, and particularly the meaning of life and work in all of its nuances inclusive of love, suffering and our work. The meanings of life, death, and the experience of the concentration camp and healing from it form part one. Part three defines LOGOTHERAPY and it's development on the bases of experience and the results of other less effective and very \\"attractive\\" forms of analysis all stemming from Freud that 'allow' other to develop a life that is devoid of spirit and human responsibilities.<br />The needs of the human spirit do not change. I've shared them with family including children, friends, colleagues, and readership for some time. Will to meaning is something that animals and analysts do not do or worry about at all. Frankl and others to include all of the American Psychological Association noted that psychoanalysis, analysis, and all \\"alleged\\" depth and anaytical approaches to humans were more than willing to turn \\"will to meaning\\" to a neurosis and frailty! Human spirituality exists separate of religion, and very often atheists and their families neglect this aspect of life at their peril. The concept of deity and spirituality are and should be mutually exclusive. Religion demands and does otherwise and atheism and agnosticism often throw out the proverbial baby and bathwater. Spirituality is a value and scientific in every way as Frankl is willing to relate to those willing to read.<br />\\"The mind is a place of its own and makes a heav'n of hell and a hell of heav'n.\\" John Milton: \\"Paradise Lost\\"
B00005K3NR|4.0|&quot;Carrie&quot; is still the best Stephen King horror film yet made. The story, I think, is enough to put any sensitive teen off. This is because the cruelty of the high school students is realistically portrayed. Sissy Spacek is superb in her Oscar-nominated role as the title character. There are many scenes that scare me so much, like the opening shower scene and the prom. There are also sad moments and Pino Dinaggio's score is beautiful. The DVD includes two wonderful documentaries on the film, with cast and crew interviews. They are really happy to talk about the film and tell some funny stories. I recommend this film to any fans of horror dramas.
B0000024Q8|5.0|The first time I heard this recording, some twenty-five years ago, I was a bit shocked - it was utterly unlike anything I had experienced in &quot;classical&quot; music.  But after a few listening sessions it began to grow on me.  The repetitions and subtle pattern changes will either enthrall or bore you; one person's trance is another's monotony.  Whatever the case, there is much to admire in Terry Riley's classic experiment with structure and instrumentation.  <br />Since this landmark recording, there have been other noteworthy versions.  I own an interesting one by the Shanghai Film Orchestra, which includes a number of Chinese instruments which create a uniquely shimmering texture.  And the recent recording by the superb Bang on a Can All-Stars is not to be missed.  But this one was the first, and has its own place in history.

It should be part of any music lover's collection, not just any jazz music lover's collection.<br />The remainder of John Coltrane's ouvre are more than enough to secure his place in history in American music.  &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; marries a great composer with a great quartet in a great recording securing his place for the ages.  McCoy Tyner's keyboard work especially on &quot;Resolution&quot; and the dirge-like &quot;Psalm&quot; is breathtaking.  Elvin Jones' solo and accompanying work on &quot;Pursuance&quot; is without equal on any jazz or rock album.  And Jimmy Garrison's bass lines throughout the album are a flawless counterpoint to Coltrane's excursions.  How tragic that his life and career were far too brief.  As for the master himself, I have always preferred 'Trane's work on the soprano saxophone.  I feel that he is freer, more angular with the soprano.  The one exception is his tenor work on this album.<br />I highly recommend this album to anyone interested in music.  It does not get any better than this.

044651652X|5.0|This may be a simple story about simple people, but they are REAL people. If you don't like &quot;romantic&quot; feelings in the true, raw sense then this book may appeal less, but if you believe in the power of simple love; there is nothing better. I was crying when I read the &quot;afterword&quot; by the photographer's friend musician.
0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier's novel is one of the best I've ever read.  She creates Vermeer's world perfectly, down to every little detail without making it seem like a textbook.  Though the plot is simple, it doesn't detract from the story at all, because of her superb characterizations and setting.  The story follows sixteen-year-old Griet, who becomes a maid for the Vermeers.  She slowly comes to know Vermeer, and his world of painting.  This is an incredible historical tale that will keep you intrigued the whole time.
6304696566|5.0|I saw this picture 14 times at the old Mayfair Theatre on a double bill with The Parent Trap,(a great Hayley Mills Flic!)Back in the days when it cost 25 cents. (Twice a day for 7 days that is!) I have it on VHS, and plan to upgrade to DVD. You can't go wrong owning this film,as it may be John Waynes' best acting role in a western. The paring of the Duke with Jeffrey Hunter was genius,and the cinematography,(Monument Valley),is breathtaking! After Ethan (the Duke),returns home from the Civil War,he finds his closest family members wiped out in a renegade indian raid,except for Lucy,(a young Natalie Wood),whom the Commanches have taken for their own. The relentless hunt is on,through the four brutal seasons,and over years,Ethan is obsessed with finding 'Scar' the chief of the Commanches,and avenging his families death. Excellent action,and and excellent plot,with a surprise ending. The savageness and desperation that faced the early western pioneers is well-portrayed by FORD,in what I believe is his best collaberation with John Wayne. Great supporting cast,with the likes of Vera Miles and Ward Bond. It was my priviledge to review this great epic,and I recommend it most highly. - Ron Larocque
B00000JLEP|5.0|I love this disc (which to be fair, has received very mixed comments). Boulez, with his typical focus on clarity, tackles this volcanic composer's overheated music with compelling results. It's not the only way to play Scriabin -- some may prefer a more overtly emotional thrust -- but it works.<br />The fabulous Chicago Symphony sounds thrilling, with the gleaming brass dominating but not overpowering the dense textures. I especially like this version of \\"Prometheus,\\" which includes the choral part - here sung by the excellent Chicago Symphony Chorus.<br />Other versions may sound \\"more Russian\\" or be more passionate, but the approach here works on its own glittery, crystalline terms.
B000004286|5.0|Horner gets a lot of flak from movie afficionados.  Yes, he does recycle themes from one score to the next.  Parts of his work from 1989's &quot;Glory&quot; can be easily heard in &quot;Braveheart&quot; and vice-versa.  This score is probably better than any other he has done-with other highlights being &quot;Star Trek II&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, and &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.  Braveheart is the best of all of these.  This disc is gorgeous, full of wonderful motifs and dynamism.  The recording is top-notch, the orchesra sounds full and expansive.  If it were possible to wear out a CD, I would have worn this one out years ago.  A high moment in film scoring.
B000023VR6|5.0|On the 2001 track Forget About Dre, Dr. Dre proclaims, All you ... that said that I turned pop on the Firm flop, yall are the reason why Dres been getting no sleep. Apparently the work he churned out during those sleepless nights lead to the production of this hip-hop classic. What the good Doctor was referring to was the constant criticism from those that felt he fell off after releasing the below-Dre-standards compilation album The Aftermath and his somewhat lackluster take on The Firm album. Dre decided to wipe the boards clean and return to the essence of what made him a household name, the essence of what made the original Chronic album a soundtrack to the streets and the essence of what made the West Coast an Death Row Records untouchable in the early 90s, that good ol Gangsta Ish.  2001 can almost be soon as a West Coast reunion compilation with a futuristic backdrop courtesy of Dr. Dres ultimate production capabilities. Dre spends time on track such as Still Dre and The Watcher to let the world know that even though hes been away hes back and better than ever, with a rejuvenated Snoop Dogg lending vocal support to Still Dre. Truth is that when paired with Andre Youngs production, the DoggFather sounds better than he had sounded in years. Guest rappers are on just about every track. Eminem obviously, along with Nate Dogg, Kurupt, Knocturnal, 6Two and many up and coming LA rhyme spitters on the come up. One of the albums greatest moments comes from a pre-limelight Xzibit as he rips Whats The Difference to shreds. ...You and Xxplosive are just a couple of the albums classics and showcase Dres abilities behind the boards. Hopefully, Dr. Dre can take West Coast rap to yet the next level when his next masterpiece DETOX is released in 2003!
B00005K3LU|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\" is simpily, by far, the king of all action cinemas.  It gave birth to a new genre of pulse-poundng adventure, while at the same time, giving birth to the career of Bruce Willis and John McTiernan.  The movie's plot gives in to a idea of paranoia; You're stuck at the 33rd floor of a sky scaper, full of terrorists and hostages, armed with only a 9mm pistol and street smart skills.  What would you do???  Or should I say, what would John McClane do???<br />The story of Die Hard takes place in LA.  New York cop John McClane (Willis) is visiting his asstanged wife, Holly, whom work for Nakatmomi enterprises, a major Japanese corporation.  The Nakatomi plaza is a huge sky scraper in the middle of Century City, where John meets his wife now Holly Gennero, instead of Holly McClane.  After a small argument in her office on the 33rd floor, John and Holly are split up when a group of Terrorists, lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), a German Hijacker.  Their objective is to steal over 4 billion dollars in bonds from the Nakatomi safe, while get away safely. They kill Mr. Nakatomi and take the entire staff hostage.  John is the only one who manages to get away.  He uses his street smart skills to navigate through the tedious tower floors, emlinate the terrorists and their leader, and save his marrage at the same time!  <br />\\"Die Hard\\" rocks hard!  No doubt that this is was the beginning of a new geneation of action and adventure.  The only movie that comes close to being as good as this one, is it's third sequel \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance\\" which is actually the real sequel to this film (don't even bother seeing \\"Die Hard 2\\".  It stinks to high heaven).  By the DVD, because it is jammpacked full of special features and audio commentary.  Yippie Ky Yay!
B000002U82|5.0|When I listened to this album. I was stunned. This is indeed a great album and its no wonder why it sold so well as it did and still does. This album is very memorable. Not just that it was a huge smash. It because the album and the songs on it are truly a gem and probably one of the most exciting thing ever in music history. All the songs here are truly amazing and all the sound effects too. I mean who would make a sound of a cash registor on an album in the early 70s no one except the brilliant Pink Floyd. the mastermined and kings of alternative and experimenting music. If you dont have this cd now. I suggest you go to your local record store and buy it. It is truly a gem and if its not in your cd collection. You dont have a real cd collection. Thank You

6303140157|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever!  The critics just don't understand it.  This is a classic kids movie, and you still like it when you get older.  So what if it doesn't make any shocking statements?  It's FUN!!! (ducktape...HELLO)  The music is great and so is the acting.  Lauryn Hill is in it; you can't go wrong with that!  Not only that, but remember the scene where the kid sings \\"When Jesus Washed\\" and he gets all high?  of course you do!  Everyone does.  How many movies can you name that have a scene that EVERYONE knows?<br />Yes, the movie is far-fetched, but that's true of all movies.  Bottom line, the movie is enjoyable if you take it for what it is: fun, mindless, HARMless entertainment.
B00003CXAR|5.0|What can a person say when he is confronted with the incedible task of reviewing one of the most influential movies of all time. To this day Jaws is leading cause of the fear of sharks. Openly displaying a man eating killing machine that seems overwhelmingly impossible to defeat. Robotical tricks crafted by the movie master, Steven Speilberg, bring Jaws side by side with Star Wars.<br />Amity island was a peaceful summertime island until a girl was lost underwater late at night. And then a dog went, and then a boy, until the shark had become a major problem for the mayor and the town. Amity lived off the summer tourists coming to the beach, but without the beach Amity wasn't much. As I said the mayor was anxious to quickly disperse this problem as quietly as possible. Offering a hefty payout, Amity recruited a solo shark hunter (Shaw) and a marine expert (Dreyfuss), and the town police chief tagged along for the ride. <br />A stellar preformance was delivered by each and every cast member on board. The music is truly one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard come out of a movie. A familiar name comes to mind with these marvelous compositions, Jon Williams. Jaws has lived through 2 and 1/2 decades as one of the leading movies of all time, I am overwhelmingly confident that it will continue to shine bright as the ultimate showcase for Steven Spielberg's incredible talent.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I finally got this DVD.  Man, is it great!  I loved the live album, so I knew I had to get this.  Hearing them play live is one thing, but actually seeing them play is quite another.  This is just the best thing ever.  Watching John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy go off is just astonishing.  They're two of the best musicians ever.  John Myung and Jordan Rudess are up there as well.  I already discussed how great the music is in my review for the live album, so I won't go into it.  Plus, you can't really put it into words, anyway.  If you like Dream Theater, you  need this.  It will put a smile on your face that won't go away.
B000002ADT|5.0|The first time I owned this disc (in college), I purchased it after a conversation with a friend whose taste in music I trusted. I did not own any jazz at the time and KOB was my first foray into the genre. I did not get it. I did not like it especially. As a person coming from a hard rock background, I felt like the music was too disorganized (!)...so I sold it.<br />A few years later I purchased it again when Columbia began to remaster Davis' recordings. By this time I was really getting into jazz and already had a good number of albums. As I listened to this disc again, with fresh ears, I was floored. I heard what Wynton Marsalis described in the Ken Burns film 'Jazz' as Miles 'sustained intensity'. See, this is NOT music that hits you over the head and says HELLO! This is music that quietly beckons you in a subtle way. This disc is flawless *but* I do not necessarily recommend it as a first buy for jazz greenhorns. For me, I needed to hear numerous Coltrane albums (My Favorite Things, Giant Steps, Blue Train) along with Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\" and Quincy Jones' jazz/funk masterpiece \\"Walkin In Space\\" before I was ready to return to \\"Kind of Blue\\". <br />Some have complained about the lack of intensity on the disc, Miles playing, and it's sleep-inducing qualities...well look at the title of the disc! KIND OF BLUE! This is not meant to be a fierce tenor battle like \\"Tenor Madness\\", \\"Chasing the Trane\\", \\"Orbits\\", or \\"Giant Steps\\". This IS late night music for many people, relaxing music. It's anytime music for me. It is what it is and some people have a hard time accepting it for that. Great music doesn't always grab you by the throat. Sometimes it burrows into your brain and plants a seed because you aren't ready to appreciate it yet. People have their own opinions about what jazz is or is not, but to claim that Louis Armstrong and Duke comprise 'real' jazz, but Miles is somehow outside of that tradition is ridiculous. It all depends on where you are coming from. Hard-rockers will probably appreciate later, crazier \\"Ascension\\" period Coltrane before they appreciate more subtle works like Kind of Blue. I needed to hear other things first-I wanted the fire and passion of jazz like Coltrane's \\"Countdown\\" and \\"I want to talk about you\\" before I could place tunes from this disc in some sort of context.<br />So if you don't *get* this album, wait for a while and pursue some other jazz recordings. If you don't have previous jazz-listening experience, KOB may sound like just another album to you. But for an experienced jazz fan, (when listened to in the context of so many other recordings) this one stands above most everything else.<br />Essential.
B000060OWV|3.0|First of all, this is (or should be) an album for guitar players.  And as always, Robben Ford sounds terrific.  Seven stars for his playing.  Unlike a lot of guys, he just keeps getting better.<br />But after the first cut--a sort of Robben Ford meets Sam &amp; Dave thing--the rest of the tunes just plod along.  None of them is as catchy as I'm Your Man or  Talk To Your Daughter.  Some songs have changes that are clever, like when Scott Henderson plays blues but clever doesn't get my feet tapping.<br />Last but not least, he sings.  And sings.  We can argue if he's the greatest vocalist since Caruso but the lyrics are just filler.<br />Robben Ford has so many killer albums its hard to pick but if you want one that will give you chills look for the semi-bootleg Live In San Francisco.  In the middle of a long and brilliant solo he cuts from I'm Your Man to Purple Haze.  Robben Ford playing Purple Haze...need I say more?
0395951054|4.0|If you are one of those people who are looking to further understand history by reading literature, then you will probably want to read Mein Kampf. In this book, you will find the ideologies and personality that led Adolf Hitler to take the course that he did. You will be able to further understand why things happened and why Hitler acted the way he did. Keep in mind, however, that this book must be read with an open mind that wishes to learn more about this aspect of history.<br />Mein Kampf was not written for you to sit down and read for enjoyment, and it should not be taken that way. The reading can be slow at times, but if you really wish to learn more about Hitler, the Third Reich, and what led to the Second World War, then this book is an indispensible resource.
B00003CX95|5.0|Even though Mel Gibson won Oscars for his work, I still believe that there should have been more hype about Braveheart. Braveheart will draw more emotions out of you then any other movie. Pushing the limits of courage and loyalty are a priority of the peasent General William Wallace (Gibson). <br />In the period of English domination and suppresion of Scotland, a small militia was formed and headed by William Wallace. Wallace and troops were able to crush the forces in Scotland and continue the battling by invading England. The only communication that Wallace had with the dictoral King Longshanks was through his daughter-in-law (Marceau). Marceau falls for Wallace though before she even meets with him and quickly becomes disloyal to the king. The rest will unravel for interested viewers in the movie. <br />Braveheart is not for young viewers or viewers who can not tolerate all out gore scenes. Lined with witty comedy and a passionate love, Braveheart touches on each of the hearts feelings. One feeling however is much stronger than others and that is loyalty. Braveheart strains the human heart as one of the most courageous performances ever put on by a man is played in Braveheart.
B000063CPL|5.0|Yay, the new live Maiden's finally here!  If you've read my reviews before, you might know that I don't really like live albums, and rarely ever buy them.  However, I sometimes make an exception in the case of a band I really like.  I did just that here, and man am I glad I did!<br />This is just too freaking good.  If it's not better than \\"Live after Death\\", it ain't too far behind.  This is proof positive that Maiden can still rock.  Great stuff here, and it's awesome to hear the \\"Brave New World\\" stuff played live.  Bruce brought whole new life to the Blaze Bailey songs (which were never bad anyway, they're just better now), and still belts out the Paul Dianno stuff well.  It is a shame that there's nothing from \\"Somewhere in Time\\" here, and only one song from \\"7th Son\\", but them's the brakes, I guess.<br />If you like Maiden, buy this, buy it now!!  And, get the new live Megadeth, also good.<br />UP THE MF IRONS!!!!!!

6305878323|5.0|Like many folks here, I saw this one when I was very young--right after second grade, I think. By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.  Not that that mattered.  To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must-see movie of that summer--the way \\"Star Wars\\" would be in the next decade.  I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap-dancing with the penguins and crying during the \\"Bird Woman\\" song (which was as much social commentary as a sentimental tune about our feathered friends). I became a fan of Dick Van Dyke's show after this--he basically won my heart as Bert--the jack-of-all-trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.  For the rest of that summer, man, I WAS Mary Poppins.  My mom bought me a record of all the songs, I used her old Avon sample case as my carpetbag, and I acted out the movie every day. If VCRs and DVDs had been everyday household items then, I would have asked for \\"Mary Poppins\\" for Christmas. (It would have been worn out by Easter, most likely!)<br />As happens to children almost overnight, my interests changed over the next year and I sort of got over my fixation with Mary, Bert, et. al.  After all, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke went on to other things after that, so why not me?  <br />And then in the 90s, Disney re-released \\"Mary Poppins\\" as a video.  I bought it for my daughter (or at least that was the excuse I gave my husband).  Though she was too young to understand everything in the movie--just as I was the first time I saw it--she, too, loved \\"Mary Poppity\\" as she called it.  We must have played it at least 3 times a week during the first summer we had it, while living in temporary housing and waiting for our house to be built.  She, too, loves to act this one out and to sing the songs for hours on end.  The apple does not fall far from the tree, I guess.<br />As for me. . .it's all Iremembered it to be, and then some. For starters, the music. . .what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score--they were beautifully put together.  And the little details are delightful, too.  Among them:  Mrs. Banks, who is a feminist (at least when Mr. Banks isn't around) wears bloomers--and later in the movie, we discover Mary Poppins does, too.  (don't blink, or you'll miss seeing them)  The relationship between Mary and Bert. . .as a child I thought they were probably a couple but never had time to see each other because of their work.  Now?  I think they would be a couple if they got a lucky break.  Let's face it--she's a nanny and he's a lower-level tradesman.  Even if they did get married,  in 1910, the realities of British society were such that if you weren't part of the gentry, you worked for a living, and changing your \\"class\\" or status didn't happen.  A shame, because their characters obviously love children very much.  So they do the next best thing--work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle-class homes--mainly by shaking up the parents.  Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one--he was the idea man, and she handled the implementation. <br />And therein is the secret:  this movie was not as much about Mary, Bert, and the kids as it is about Mary, Bert, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks.  It's when Mr. Banks realizes that his children don't need a nanny to be happy--they just need their parents to love them and give them their attention--that he also becomes the man that the Bank needs.  The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.  <br />As for the ending?  When I was a child, I didn't understand it.  Now, as an adult, I do.  The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.  As one of the main characters said, all was as it should be.<br />So is this movie.  Enjoy it with your own daughter. . .
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Richard Farnsworth, and his tallent seemed to walk hand in hand, because he was so naturally gifted on screen. From Anne of Green Gables, to The Natural, and even Into the Night, Farnsworth has always done a sure-fire method of humble acting. His gifts, even while under physical pain, were just as evident in the Straight Story.<br />The 73 year old, cigar loving, veteran, Alvin Straight finds out that his brother is sick, and must go on a journey of forgiveness. He and his brother have resentment in their past and have avoided one another for decades because of a simple argument. Sissy Spasek plays his loving and mentally handicapped daughter. This is one of her best performances (next to &quot;A place for Annie&quot;).<br />The mode of transport? An old John Deere lawn mower. Along the way he encounters many people and touches all of their lives. Most memorably the life of a teenage runaway, who is afraid to tell her parents that she is pregnant.<br />There is one scene that closely reminds me of the &quot;Carl tells his Past&quot; portion in the opening of Sling Blade. It is truly haunting as Straight tells one of his new found friends (also a veteran - Straight tells him he could see it in his eyes) about a memory from the war.<br />The ending of the Straight Story is one of the most rewarding endings you will ever see. It is a simple moment of true emotions and is everything it should be. ~s.a.o.s.~

B000006TRV|5.0|This album is truly one of the best. I like Disc One more, because of songs like: Another Brick in the Wall (I,II,III) Mother, Good-Bye Blue Sky, Empty Spaces, Young Lust, Don't Leave Me Now. My favorite is \\"One of My Turns\\". Disc Two I like because of songs Like \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" Also, \\"the Trial\\" is a crazy song, and really freaks me out, but is truly amazing.<br />I also own Dark Side of the Moon, and I enjoy it. Sometimes Im just not in the mood for Techno-ish Rock. This is when I listen to The Wall. <br />If its your first time listening to it, be sure to listen to it from start to finsh in one sitting, with the lights out, and no other noise to distract you. Listen to every word, and don't skip tracks to recieve to effect of this great album.
0800177363|5.0|'Awakenings' has been my favorite movie for a long time now, but it hasn't always been so. I suppose it took a bit of maturing, and maybe a couple years of vigorous movie watching to come to the conclusion that this is my favorite.<br /><br /> Robin Williams plays a realistic, tender, giving person named Doctor Sayer. His innocence and humbleness in the movie is something that baffled me all through my younger years. How could the crazy Robin Williams pull of something so real? Well, I was unknowing to his other accomplishments prior to that time. Movies such as 'Good Morning, Vietnam' and 'Dead Poets Society' had already been added to his filmography. The Robin Williams I knew had only been in movies like Popeye and little show called Mork and Mindy. Since 'Awakenings' he has done amazing performances in both the dramatic, and comedic realms. Soon to be added to his list of talent's is the \\"Serial Killer\\" in Insomnia. What an amazing actor. Also see his dramatic acting in 'What Dreams May Come'.<br />Julie Kavner is someone who I have recently discovered. How could I not have placed her voice with that of Marge Simpson. Well, to put it mildly I had a duck when I put that together. Her list of accomplishments include the honest movie 'This is My Life' and, of course The Simpsons.<br />Robert Deniro will never (mark my words) be able to top his sacrificial performance as Leonard. Not even his classic and raw character in 'The Deer Hunter' came close to Leonard. From being totally motionless to having his body wracked with the gripping illness, he is totally believable, and never allows the viewer to doubt he isn't for real. The fact that he didn't win an oscar is a tragedy.<br />Based on Dr Oliver Sack's true life experiences in the late 60's, 'Awakenings' the book is written in chapters titled by the patient's name. Most memorably \\"Lucy\\" and \\"Leonard.\\" It tells of his experiments with the drug \\"L-dopa\\" (a synthetic dope) to attack the sickness from a Parkinson's Disease(p&auml;rkn-snz) stand-point.<br />Amidst the powerful words of the movie (so many, of which you must discover on your own) is the amazing musical score by Randy Newman, who righfully won his first oscar in 2003 for best original song. He shows his tallent for creating emotional and entirely unique compositions. This movie has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Unfortunately the soundtrack is hard to find.<br />There are movies, epic's mostly, that people are accustomed to watching over and over. I have seen 'Awakenings' between 50 and 100 times, and with every viewing learn and appreciate something new about life. Penny Marshall's project was bigger than her, bigger than the actors, bigger than the screen. Her insight made it that way. She created something that she will never be able to re-do or re-capture. Though her movies like 'A League of Their Own' and 'Big' are great classics worth owning, the emotional and spiritual depth of 'Awakenings' is something that only It can do. When you watch this, my favorite film, reflect on your own life. How much you have. How much you could loose. This is a learning experience that everyone should own. ~S.A.O.S.~s Disease(pärkn-snz) stand-point.<br />Amidst the powerful words of the movie (so many, of which you must discover on your own) is the amazing musical score by Randy Newman, who righfully won his first oscar in 2003 for best original song.

Though her movies like 'A League of Their Own' and 'Big' are great classics worth owning, the emotional and spiritual depth of 'Awakenings' is something that only It can do. When you watch this, my favorite film, reflect on your own life. How much you have. How much you could loose. This is a learning experience that everyone should own. ~S.A.O.S.~

B00005UQ9F|4.0|The modern film industry often substitutes the grotesque and shocking horror for that which gets under the skin. The former has more punch at the box office I guess. To see another kind of horror, one must dig for gold at the local video store. <BR>Session 9 is a creepy little nugget directed by Brad Anderson, whom I have never heard of before. The cast itself has only one person i've seen elsewhere, David Caruso. The rest are more unknowns. These factors could work against this film's reputation, which is unfortunate. This is definitely worth adding to one's collection.<BR>This is a basic story about a group of guys working in a big, empty, scary building with the unsettling fact that it was once an institution for the insane. Many tensions build as the job progresses. Our guys are removing hazerdous materials from the building, and they don't have as much time as they normally do. The owner, Gordon, is having financial troubles that weigh heavily on his mind. Gordon's nephew is new and untried, which doesn't help. Two others, Phil and Hank had a woman come between them, and the last, Mike, is working hazmat despite pressure to follow his father into law.<BR>These tensions incubate in the crumbling asylum, where the past seems to live on in its various pictures, implements, and dark places. Mike becomes interested in an old evidence recording he finds in a storage room, which describes the case of a frightened girl with multiple personality disorder. As he becomes more interested in the case, Hank finds something of interest in the basement and shortly disappears. Gordon confides a personal problem to his foreman Phil, who may have a problem of his own. <BR>And Gordon's young nephew is terribly afraid of the dark.<BR>As tensions crawl closer to the surface, it becomes clear that there is going to be a reckoning, and at this point it is impossible to stop watching the events unfold. I had a hard time figuring out just how things were going to turn out, which is always a fun challenge. When the end finally came, I was still left pondering the question 'Why?', until I thought more about the case of the girl with M. P. D. While the reasons for the final events are not exactly laid bare, it is a compelling, disturbing and thought provoking story. <BR>Surely each viewer will understand this story in their own way, such is the beauty of the psycho-drama. Director Brad Anderson has a good cast, a great building to play in, and a very good script which he wrote with Stephen Gevedon (who plays Mike in the film). <BR>Although I have never heard of this director or most of the cast before, I will certainly be very interested in their future projects.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album is truly one of the best. I like Disc One more, because of songs like: Another Brick in the Wall (I,II,III) Mother, Good-Bye Blue Sky, Empty Spaces, Young Lust, Don't Leave Me Now. My favorite is \\"One of My Turns\\". Disc Two I like because of songs Like \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" Also, \\"the Trial\\" is a crazy song, and really freaks me out, but is truly amazing.<br />I also own Dark Side of the Moon, and I enjoy it. Sometimes Im just not in the mood for Techno-ish Rock. This is when I listen to The Wall. <br />If its your first time listening to it, be sure to listen to it from start to finsh in one sitting, with the lights out, and no other noise to distract you. Listen to every word, and don't skip tracks to recieve to effect of this great album.
B00005YW4H|4.0|i just picked this cd up not knowing a thing about it. it's a great soothing relaxing cd. reminds me of being at the kerrville folk festival - i'd chalk her up to a texas artist if i didnt know any differently!
B00005Y1UX|5.0|INDECENT PROPOSAL WAS THE BEST LOVE TRIANGLE MOVIE IVE SEEN IT HAS 3 GREAT ACTORS WOODY HARRELSON. DEMI MOORE AND ROBERT REDFORD. IT WAS TIGHT ITS WORTH THE TWENTY DOLLARS
B000002JS6|5.0|In 1981 AC/DC was in shambles. Bon Scott, one of the greatest frontmen ever, was dead, and their future went with it... or so it seemed. Yet there they were, back with a brand new singer, ready to take the world by storm with one of the greatest albums it had ever known.<br />Sure a lot of people were cynical, and thought that AC/DC with this Brian Johnson dude would never compete with Bon Scott AC/DC. They were in for a big surprise. The man in the front may be new, but the message is the same; drink, party, get some, and rawk and roll. The Young brothers still make the greatest riffs in the world, recycling the old ones (several of these riffs were already on Highway to Hell) and bringing some new ones to the mix. They still have a helluva screamer as a frontman, and Mutt Lange is still there to turn their sound into sweet majic. The title track is AC/DC's greatest, and contains the greatest guitar riff EVER, and You Shook Me All Night Long is simply rawk at its finest. They continue to make timeless rock anthems such as Brian Johnson proclaims that &quot;rock and roll ain't noise pollution.&quot; And Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams remain one of rock's most solid rhythm sections. <br />To wrap this all up this is heavy metal at its greatest and most simplistic. If you love catchy riffs and lyrics that aren't very poetic and party ready then your life isn't complete until you have this in your collection. Whether Brian Johnson or Bon Scott is fronting the band AC/DC will still deliver some of the greatest rock 'n' roll ever put to tape. So buy this album, listen to it right away, turn the headphones up until your ears explode and enjoy. You'll be shook all night long!
B00005R2BG|5.0|The soundtrack was unexpected and wonderfully different. I was personally very surprised that Nicole could sing. The lack of cheesy voiceovers gave the film a degree of realism that was needed in such a surreal movie.<br />Any student of cinematography will have to agree that the tricks used by the director of this film to hook you in worked. The strategic use of red, for passion and danger the polyphonic voicing within the scenes and the swirling camera scenes kept you hooked and riveted to get the meanings behind what was happening were truly Spectacular Spectacular.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was a little shy to buy this compilation, as it was cut and pasted together, but it is wonderful for what it is--an uplifting, unchallenging disc for the good times.<BR>It is suitable for both beginners and advanced listeners.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I just watched the movie again and it is even more powerful than when I saw it when it came out. I have to say though that once I saw it the first time, I said to my friends \\"No one would ever try and attack us again\\" The movie came out before 9/11 so neither I (or anyone) had any idea what was about to happen. There is one exchange between Affleck's character and his British commander that really sticks out. He says that \\"Alot of people frown on the yanks for not joining this war but if there are more like you back at home, then God help anyone who goes to war with America.\\" That gave me a sense of American pride like never before. It's odd how we can now relate to this movie because like what happened on Dec 7 1941 that sent the US into war. The events of Sept 11 2001 did the same. <br />If you haven't seen it yet, do. It will really move you.
B000063JZQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this DVD release for a while.  This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations I have seen to date, even though it certainly is not suitable for all audiences.  The gloomy, down-to-earth, in-the-mud brutal reality of Medieval Scotland permeates the entire movie.  Yet despite that, or perhaps owing to this very fact, the movie perfectly captures Macbeth and his wife's descent into madness and death. After watching the movie you might feel like you need to take a shower, yet you will feel you have witnessed a powerful presentation. It will also give you a bit of an insight into Polanski's personal tragedy, from which I think he never really recovered (look at his subsequent movies).<BR>Coming back to Shakespeare, though Macbeth is a dark tragedy, the Bard did add one 'comic relief' gatekeeper scene into the play, to cheer up the audience amid all this brutality and madness - pay attention to Polanski's version of this scene.
B00001PE4D|5.0|The tale of love and betrayl gets a face lift...and breast implants. In this sleek movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, and Reese Wheterspoon. A kid makes a wager with his STEP sister that he can deflower a girl who promised not to lose her virginity until marriage. If he wins he gets intercourse with his step sister, if he loses, he loses his '54 Jaguar Roadster. Some twists and some crude moments are on the road ahead, so beware. I thought this was a sexy, profane, and wonderful movie. A must.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It's bringing the soul of the musical back into American pop culture.  Musicals are fabulous, and this is no exception.  Who would have thought that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing so well?  Their excellent voices and emotion-filled acting carries this movie and makes it what it is.  Baz Luhrmann created a masterpiece in Moulin Rouge.<br />The best way to see this movie, now that it isn't in theaters anymore, is to get the DVD.  That way you can see it in widescreen--you miss so much by seeing it chopped up, formatted for television.  See the un-chopped-up version.  Everything should be widescreen.  Also, all the extras on the DVD are really fun.  I especially recommend the different camera angles for the tango--but that's just one little tidbit of what you'll find in the depths of this DVD.  It's a great thing to explore!
6300215717|4.0|When you think Gregory Peck, you might picture General MacArthur, or even Atticus Finch in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" Perfectly at home in gritty drama, Peck seems an odd fit as Joe Bradley, a course newspaper reporter in search of a big story. Even so, Peck does fit, as does Audrey Hepburn in her star-making role as Princess Ann -- the girl (and the story) who turns up in Peck's apartment. While never truly soaring, \\"Roman Holiday\\" is a delight to watch as Peck, Hepburn and Eddie Albert (as an unscrupulous photographer) escapade through Rome. The star quality alone make the movie worth watching; William Wyler's excellent direction and the picturesque scenery (even in black and white) make this a gem worth adding to your collection.
B00005LMBK|5.0|The Gorillaz have made a huge splash on the music business, with there first cd appropriately titled Gorillaz. If you're looking for rock this isn't the cd for you. This great track is a mix of hip hop, jazz, rap, and rock. Imagination was well used in putting this cd together and many will enjoy its originality. If you're ready to be taken for a ride, buy this cd it really is fantastic!
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Rules!  Did you see her on Rosie?  Just fabulous.  The little peep show she gave didn't hurt either.
B0000636UN|1.0|The best album by Sheryl Crow up to date: 'Globe Sessions', track for track. Forget what anyone else says. <br />On this new album, the only song that really stands out is the slightly Beach Boys inflected \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" and also \\"You're An Original Baby.\\" Other than that track, the album takes an unsatisfactory trip into late 60s and mid 70s nostalgia, and does not offer a worthwhile listening experience at all. However, folks who like stuff like The Allman Brothers, Jefferson Starship, Starland Vocal Band, Climax Blues Band....and various other oldie country rock things....etc...etc, will probably think that this new album is something of stellar quality. But for those of us who like music to be fresh and inventive, Crow's influence trip across memory lane greatly shoots down her capacity to make some supreme music. Again, how do you go from 'G. S.', to this?? It makes me wonder if Crow is still searching for her ideal music medium. If that's the case, then I guess more experiments will be coming in Crow's future albums. Whether that will be good for her or not remains to be seen. I personally like the Alt-Rock-Folkie Sheryl Crow as shown on 'G. S.' (an album more consistent on the whole than little momentary blurbs like \\"All I Wanna Do\\" and \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" and even \\"Soak Up The Sun\\"...etc). So I'm just simply stunned over what production direction she has decided to head into with this new album because the music does nothing for me. There is no point, if the music is not going to touch you and pull you in. If variances like this continue in Sheryl Crow's music, then I can see my fan status slowly diminishing. Yes, she is a great singer/songwriter, just not today with this album. Yes, this album sounds totally different than a majority of what is currently out there right now on the music scene. But, I believe that it's back to the drawing board for Sheryl Crow. We will have to see what develops next.<br />As far as this album is concerned: If you likeflashbacks, then hop onto the straw bandwagon. If you like ingenuity, then save your money for other singer/songwriters who are effectively keeping up with these contextual contemporary times, past and present, like say......Pete Yorn or Leona Naess.
B000005JA8|5.0|Which means 'good' in Irish. Difficult to digest on the early listens but there's nothing like it in other music. If i had to sum it up in one word. Bizarre.<br />Now check it out
B000002G7E|5.0|This was the second velvet underground album i bought, vu and nico being the first(which i feel is their best, simply because of the larger variety of actual tracks on the thing. I loved both of them though. I loved every song on this album but to a lesser extent &quot;i heard her call my name&quot;, it just gets annoying after awhile because, YES, feedback can be overdone. &quot;The Gift&quot; also gets stale after a few listens but it is fun to show to your friends as well as play with the speakers on it (you can get three different versions of the song depending on the centering of the sound between speakers). I love &quot;SIster RAy&quot; all 18 some odd minutes of it. Lady Godiva and Here She comes are works of melodic genius and White/LightWhite//Heat is simply a great song. I highly suggest buying this album but it is not for everyone and i do suggest buying The Velvet Underground and Nico prior to purchasing this.
0792156684|3.0|When will the Criterion edition come out, thats what I want to know!!  According to interviews Cameron gave, the theatical release was just the tip of the iceberg.  I want that extra footage--I want more of the real history of the ship, less of the romance.  There was a whole lot more shot than was actually shown, and its high time we got a criterion-type release or director's cut.  Nothing else will do for me..<BR>Folks, don't buy this DVD yet if you are a fan of the history--demand to see what they arent showing you!
B000002L7Y|2.0|A-HA is much better than some people think. This debut is very good, but suffered from two major flaws: the indecent, excessive exposing of TAKE ON ME, an amazing tune totally burned out by massive MTV and radio playing, and the slicky and acheesy production. <BR>Even being totally synth-orientated, the album could have possessed more edge to its approach, because the songs are essentially very good and melodic. There was no need to such a openly commercial production.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|One reviewer called A Beautiful Mind a \\"Goopy Treacle\\", obviously intending to impress us more with his high falootin' vocabulary than with his review. He even managed to review the John Nash book, which he never read. If your boundless intelligence puts you so far above the rest of the American race that it requires you to use the thesaurus' least used matches for common words (because common words don't properly display your vast intelligence), then American movies probably aren't your thing, anyway. I recommend sitting in a quiet corner and reading something Latin.<br />If the only way this movie can be a good one is if it follows an exact adaptation to the book, then you won't enjoy the movie.<br />If you think the only way a movie can be good is to exactly follow the book it's based on, then you're seriously missing out.<br />The movie was brilliant. The acting was excellent. The story was amazing. If you have a heart and a mind, this movie should appeal to you greatly. This was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen, and it should be watched by You and everybody you know.<br />There's something wrong with you if this movie doesn't grip you and make you think at the same time.
B000002B5L|5.0|No words can describe the quality of this album. Every spectrum of hip-hop and R&B have been executed perfectly on this relic. My only question... will there EVER be a follow-up? I ... hope so!
0061040967|4.0|In &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, Terry Pratchett takes the reader to the Discworld... a place where anything can happen and most of it does.

Oh yeah, and that is where he takes you in all the Discworld novels.

To those of you who are familiar with the novels, picture Carrot, Rincewind, the Librarian and Leonard of Quirm in the same place, shudder, then put your mouse down.<br />I thought that this book was a rather entertaining &quot;Candy Bar for the Mind&quot; but it was not it did not contain the high wit or the highly contagous writing that I have come to expect from Terry.  The biggest problem with this book is that Pratchett set the bar too high with his previous work.  I gave this book 4 stars for the simple reason that I love the art by Paul Kidby and Terry will always be my fave.
B000062YB1|5.0|This is a phenominal achievement. Not only do Slayer produce what is arguably one of the finest metal ablums of all time in 'Reign in Blood', but they go on to produce two more all - time classics. 'South of Heaven' showed us what they could do when playing slightly slower and now this...<br />This mixes the intensity and speed of 'Reign in Blood' with the increased heaviness of 'South of Heaven'. Also worth a mention is the maturity of the tracks. Not only do we delve into topics of old, but are now taken through the minds of soldiers in the carnage of war and into the minds of serial killers. I refer in this instance of course to 'Dead Skin Mask'. The ending of this is truly spine chilling, with victims pleading to be set free. <br />Very much like 'Reign' this album starts and ends with the albums two strongest tracks. Both of which what I would consider to be along side other legendary tracks like 'Raining Blood' and 'Angel of Death'. 'War Ensemble' blasts out of the starting blocks and destroys all in it's path, whilst the title track should be savoured by all. The intro is incredible, and once the track gets going Mr Lombardo shows us just what a God behind the drums he really is.<br />I have heard some critics say that this album is commercial because it is probably Slayer's most accessible album. I beg to differ. If we look at what Metallica produced merely a year later (The Black Album) we see what is truly commercial.This is nothing of the sort. There are still some old type thrashers in here, and they balance the overall speed of the album beautifully.<br />Suffice to say, along with 'Reign in Blood' Slayer possibly have the two greatest metal albums ever heard. I do not think that they have ever reached these heights again.<br />Everyone needs to hear this album. Simply to appreciate the brilliance of this band. Some argue that they are talentless, but I feel that this shows that they have far more talent than any new up and coming band have now, or could ever dream of. Do not miss this, it should already really be in your collection.

B00005N9CV|4.0|There is no question that Diana Krall's recent recording have created quite a stir and legitimate concern for her fans. How many times have we seen this scenario before? Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, one of Diana Krall's influences, started out with an influential jazz-oriented and ground-breaking piano, bass and guitar trio only to abandon same for the relative security of large orchestra pop music. Were his fans disappointed? You bet!<br />Ironically, it would seem that Diana is doing the same thing. But unlike most others, she is continuing a normal development of her gifts. Her producers know that. THE LOOK OF LOVE cd is calculated, well thought out and produced and ultimately well intentioned. The music is also very good with its principal failing being a little too much orchestration and not enough of that small group intimacy. But it CLEARLY does not paint a picture of impending sell-out or pop music doom.<br />While THE LOOK OF LOVE has definite pop music overtones her expressions of yearning, lost love and heartache are definitely jazz/blues oriented and are moving, captivating and totally convincing. There are several standout selections, with my personal favorite being I GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU VERY WELL (since so many reviewers have so many different favorites from this cd, how can it be all that bad?). Listen in particular to the very ending of the song as she concludes with &quot;...it would surely break my heart.&quot; To these ears, she is almost in tears. Very moving and it put me in tears as well.<br />Will Diana Krall become forever lost in an encroaching pop maelstrom? I hope hot. And I think not. Unlike some of her predecessors, I believe she is too committed and devoted to that which got her here. She is simply too unique and special, gracing an otherwise lackluster musical environment. And beside, there are at least two eager young lasses coming up in the jazz idiom named Jane Monheit and Norah Jones just to keep Diana looking over her shoulder. And let's not forget the wonderful Diane Reeves either.<br />So let's all relax and just enjoy this cd and be grateful that we still have the very special Diana Krall!

B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next begins with a great song, personally my favorite on the album, the classic rock anthem Baba O'Reilly (Teenage Wasteland).  The song sets the stage for the rest of the album, a interesting mix of instruments and sounds taken from all corners of the earth.  Behind Blue Eyes is a very descriptive, melodic piece, as is Gettin In Tune.  On the stronger side is a riveting Won't Get Fooled Again, which works right into My Wife, both songs about how much love can [be bad].
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynch's surreal masterpiece ERASERHEAD, is in my humble opinion the most personal 90 minutes of celluloid ever created. As with many of his other films, theories abound about this \\"nightmare on film,\\" and it seems people have more fun dissecting (no pun intended) the imagery and symbols than actually watching the film. It's certainly not enjoyable to watch, or entertaining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling, engrossing, and disturbing. A true film \\"experience.\\" There's never been anything like it from anyone else, or Lynch himself for that matter, and more likely than not we'll never see anything like it again. At it's most simplistic it's Lynch's fears and horror concerning \\"family\\" and \\"industrialism\\" taken to the nth degree. Most people describe it as post-apocolyptic, but it's truly modern/contemporary, just dark and unfamiliar to most. But again, like with many of Lynch's films--especially the recent MULHOLLAND DRIVE--you'd have to be David Lynch to fully understand everything that takes place or is shown, and that's what makes his movies so intriguing. Are his films weird and mysterious on purpose, or is this all normal to him? Of course none of us can ever know. Let's hope the rumors are true and that this will finally be available in the very near future.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club has definetly got to be one of the best movies ever.  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are awesome in this movie, and play their roles extremely well.  I didn't like the movie the first time I watched it, because it was kind of hard to understand and comprehend it all at first, but after a 2nd and 3rd viewing I took it all in, and I believe it to be one of the best movies ever.  Fight Club is full of sorts of symbolism and things of the sort, talking about life, and about people's feelings.  I still am not sure what the true meaning of the movie is, but even past that, it's still a great movie.  Buy it.
630451087X|3.0|When I saw LOST HIGHWAY in the theatre I was glad to have the Lynch I knew and loved back on track. Although not as crystaline as BLUE VELVET or ERASERHEAD, LOST HIGHWAY is Lynch at his best: a filmmaker not at all concerned about story-telling, but one wholly intent on making pretty pictures. Of course, what most of us consider a pretty picture and what Lynch does are two different things. Still, with LOST HIGHWAY, and now with MULHOLLAND DRIVE, mystery, images, identity, and dreams again take the forefront. Who is who, what is what, and when is when, are all questions one asks themselves upon viewing this film. Trying to &quot;figure it out&quot; is an absolute exercise in futility, just know going into it that you're not going to get it, that pieces of the puzzle are missing, and that you can spend many frustrating hours trying to piece it together without any luck. For my money MD is a much better film than LH, hence the 3 star rating here, mainly for the fact that as utterly confusing as MD is it is more cohesive and subtle than LH, with much finer acting as well. Loggia's character is overwrought, and Pryor is an unfortunate novelty-casting mistake. Lynch, like Tarantino, almost strives to revive Hollywood throwaways, but in this case it just seems sad. Balthazar Getty is a poor-poor-man's Charlie Sheen, and only Pullman and Arquette seem to really grasp the futility of their character's lives. I defnitely enjoyed this as Lynch's comeback film (before he got supernormal with THE STRAIGHT STORY), but wouldn't trade in my Widescreen VHS version for the DVD. MULHOLLAND is the better film of the two, and I'm anxious to see what pops out of his head next.

B000063JDE|5.0|I knew well enough not to order the earlier DVD release of BLUE VELVET, knowing a \\"special edition\\" couldn't be too far away (what is up with companies that do this by the way?). I cannot wait to see the extras included on this DVD, including deleted scenes I've read so much about, and a documentary on the making of the movie. In a way I'm actually surprised there are any extras at all, as David Lynch seems to completely move on from each film or project after it's finished. I don't think you'll ever find him adding banal audio commentary to any of his films, nor does he make director's cuts available (and he could since many of his movies have been edited for sexuality and violence to get that R rating). So this is a treat of a treat for the fans one of the best movies ever made.
6305754950|5.0|This is another John Wayne movies with him at his best. There are several stars from other tv programs that are in this one. The whole family will enjoy this one as with any John Wayne movie!
B000005RFQ|3.0|Tho I find BORN AGAIN to be a very flawed album, I also pre-<br />fer  it to the DIO-SABBATH albums and anything they did after 1983.<br />IAN GILLAN was an odd choice for a singer for B.S.; he had a sol-<br />id voice(i definitely like it better than DIO's voice), but when<br />he tried to write EVIL lyrics, like on DISTURBING THE PRIEST,<br />ZERO THE HERO and BORN AGAIN, I found the results very silly! I<br />laugh alot when I listen to this album! I do like the songs on it<br />quite a bit, even tho the production is awful! this album didn't<br />need to be remastered, it needed to be remixed! Musically, this<br />is probably their heaviest since MASTER OF REALITY and it sounds<br />more like old BLACK SABBATH than anything they'd done in years.<br />My favorite songs include ZERO THE HERO, the two sound effect/<br />sythesizer instrumentals STONEHENGE and THE DARK, and KEEP IT<br />WARM. This last song is the only song that GILLAN sounds comfy<br />on lyric-wise. Gillan is in very strong voice throughout the al-<br />bum, even tho i think he screams too much!<br /> it was all downhill from here.......
B00005ASGG|5.0|If you are a fan of the \\"Duke\\" then this movie is a must for your collection! It's a black and white but it is one of the best with a cast that the younger generation won't know who unless they were told. It's a regular hero cowboy vs. the bad cowboy with a strange twist. Think everybody should see this one in their life....John Wayne!!
B0000636UN|5.0|For a long time everyone has been waiting for Sheryl Crow's fourth studio album. It finally came out today (April 16), and let me tell you, it's well worth the wait.<br />Sheryl Crow is a prime example of something that gets better with age. And I'm not just talking about her looks (although those ain't bad either...did you see her in Stuff?). I'm also not saying that her other albums weren't good, because they were more than that, but THIS album easily outdoes any of them. There are classic slap-your-knee vibes in songs like \\"Soak Up The Sun\\", \\"Diamond Road\\" and \\"Lucky Kid\\", as well as original and exhilarating rhythms as those found in \\"Safe &amp; Sound\\", \\"You're An Original\\" and \\"Hole In My Pocket\\".<br />But it's not only about the music on this album. Her lyrics and singing quality will keep you interested as well. \\"Over You\\" is an interesting tune about drowning in love (if you will), while the title track combines love yearning with love angst. \\"It's So Easy\\" is right up there with \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", and \\"Weather Channel\\" is the kind of quirky yet cool tune you'd expect her to end her album with.<br />Not a single minute will be wasted on this album. It's rock, with a little bit of other flavors of music thrown in. What could be better?
6305754950|5.0|Again, John Wayne at his best in another great western. The cast is of a bunch that true western fans would know at a glance. This another one of the &quot;Duke&quot;s movie that will be a plus to your collection! Once you watch this you will enjoy it!
B00005JKJA|4.0|this movie is brilliant. there's nothing i can say that hasn't already been said. it's like a dream, like a piece of music. it's meant to be experienced, not understood. i know lynch never breaks up his films into chapters, so this didn't really bug me about the disc. it's wonderful because it contains a wonderful movie. speaking of which, the only reason i don't give MULHOLLAND the full 5 stars as a film is because of the scene where 'rita' removes her towel and gets into bed. we briefly see her fully nude in a dark room, but her crotch has been blurred out for some odd reason! what kind of weirdo censorship is this? i demand an explanation. why did they film her fully nude? why didn't they pan up to avoid getting her \\"downstairs\\" in the shot? lynch's film is full of inventive visuals and special camera/editing effects, and this is just stupid. i hope there was a reason behind this other than censorship. it's not like i have some emotional reason for WANTING to see her lower body, but i thought blurring it out was ridiculous. other than that, i loved everything about MULHOLLAND DRIVE.
B00003CXXP|1.0|feels confident enough that he seemingly doesn't care about alienating Catholic movie goers or parents who actually try to shield their children from the seemier side of life.<BR>  Since this movie is loosely based on Pinnochio, Jimminy Cricket (\\"Joe\\") is a robo-prostitute and becomes Haley Joel Osmand (Pinnochio)companion. Because of \\"Joes\\" profession, the viewer is subjected to graphic sexual talk that is not needed in the movie (Why does Joe have to be a prostitute of all things?) and children should not be exposed to. \\"Rouge City\\" was such an embarassment with it's sexual businesses and buildings , that it was here that I finally gave up and sent my children permanently out of the room. Previously, I had sent them out during \\"Joe's business.\\"<BR>  Just as well since as Catholic's, my children (and any one actually) didn't need to see the Virgin Mary made fun of with a church called \\"Our Lady's Immaculate Heart\\" and didn't need to hear about how people inside grovel, and how after they exit the chapel they become Joe's best clients.<BR>  Spielberg isn't just anti-Catholic though, he uses the vehicle of this pedantic movie to make fun of the pro-life movement by calling \\"The Flesh Fair\\", a horific spectacle that harkens back to the Roman Colliseum's blood sports, \\"Pro - Life.\\" The camera stays on this sign long enough that any viewer with brain cells would realize that a point was being made.<BR>  I gave this movie one star, not because it deserves it, but because the Amazon rating system doesn't allow negative star ratings.<BR>   What a shame. Anyone who has seen Spielberg's earlier films knows he could have done better. Too bad he has an agenda to push now.
B00005QDW1|4.0|The return of No Doubt put a smile on this music fan's face.  I never got Return of Saturn, but I loved Tragic Kingdom (especially The Climb).  The first single Hey Baby off RS alone put a smile on my face with its tongue-in-cheek style & maverick video-clip. Brilliant, although by no means my fave ever No Doubt song!  I don't think I was prepared for the remainder of this album, 'cos I was imagining a ska-type affair again.  Wrong!! It still contains all that famed No Doubt verve which we love & the honey-vocals of Ms Stefani, but with a new sound. Still ska, but with punk-rock-pop twists. The first track alone is soo confident & streetwise it's unreal.  Hella Good is driven along by a confident guitar rift & a rollercoaster chorus, which just keeps you going (as the song suggests) & the 3rd song Making Out, produced by William Orbit, is so totally different from the traditional ND style, yet whirls along (I particularly love the breakdown in the middle, with its whoo-whhooos - ace!!).  Underneath It All doesn't fare very well - takes too long to pick up the pace.  Yet the remainder of the album totally uplifts & swings along.  ND sound like they're having the time of their life & this is truly a reflection of a band in its prime.  Welcome back!!!
6304118392|5.0|I am an artist, and this movie was artisticly done.  If your not into violence then don't see it.  I've seen it three times, once in 95, twice this week, and the third time I saw it, I saw something different.  A movie that should not be watch with children, or a person who is depressed.  Only for people who do not have mental problems
B00005N9CV|4.0|I'm a big Diana Krall fan.  I have all her previous stuff.  She's a great pianist and a great singer.  But with this album she lets the orchestra dominate and lead her around.  Understanable for a first try.  But next time she records with an orchestra I hope she keep those chops out in front.  She need to think like Sinatra did -- you're the lead singer and piano player, the orchestra is there to back her up.  Nice foray into vocal music, but more pop than jazz.
6305428042|5.0|I've already written a review for \\"Hocus Pocus\\", but I'm just here to say that I'm so happy that they are FINALLY releasing this movie out on DVD! It's one of my favorite Halloween movies--Sarah Jessica Parker and Bette Midler are especially great in this one! It's funny, spooky, and wacky all at the same time! They'd better make a good DVD...with lots of special features. I am definitely planning to pre-order my very own copy of the \\"Hocus Pocus\\" DVD as soon as I find out the special features that will be added to the DVD. If there are no special features, then I will just keep my VHS tape (okay...so perhaps I'll still buy the DVD!:). But anyway, if you love \\"Hocus Pocus\\", you'll definitely be glad to know that this Disney classic is finally coming out on DVD! Can't wait!!
4789009637|5.0|I am a student in Canada and our university uses this text as the only book for our introductory course to Japanese.  This book contains everything that you need to get a firm grip on the language.  It has many basic grammar rules that will get you into the feel of Japanese quick and fairly painless.  There are over 150 kanji (Chinese symbol words) that this book will teach.  Starting this class I knew about 6 words in Japanese and none of the rules for grammar, but I am happy to say that after 8 months of hard study I passed the course with flying colours.  To get all the potential out of this book you will have to do the work, preferably with a study group.  All the lessons are chopped down into bite sized pieces so that you can absorb it easily, but each lesson is called on in future lessons... This text is a great way to start you way into this beautiful language.
B00005BIIP|5.0|Since I have all Porcupine Tree cds I could not miss this one even though I knew this was a collection of sparse material whihc did not make it to any of their previous album. <BR>However -and this is where a great prog band demonstrates its value- this album got under my skin. It is not an easy album so you will need to listen to it more than once, then you will discover it has its own coherent logic and structure as it had been conceived and built from the beginning where it was not. This is the most amazing things of all. <BR>Said this, I must warn that for a Porcupine Tree novice definetively this is not the best buy. Try Signify to understand them.<BR>But for all of us who love them this album is a pearl and a great basket of musical pleasure .
B00004U8P9|5.0|first of all, this is one of my favourite movies. a big part of this is the amazing TIM CURRY, with his brilliant performance. also the songs, art, and quite everything else.<br />the dvd comes with 2 discs. the menus are amazing, and funny, and there is a big variety of options and features.<br />this is worth buying. buy yourself a little treat. :)
6305126062|4.0|Overall, this is a lovely, heartwarming movie.  The Montana scenery is beautiful, though overly used.  The movie is nearly 2 and a half hours long -- it could have been cut to under two hours had they not spent so much time with the sweeping scenic shots.  Robert Redford is perfectly cast as Tom Booker, The Horse Whisperer... though he seems to be &quot;going through the motions&quot; and not giving too much depth to his character.  That seems to be the problem with all the characters... not enough depth to them.  The story is well done, though clumsy at points.  The story is that of a girl who has an accident with her horse, causing the horse to become unstable and causing her to lose her leg.  So, the mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) takes her and the horse to see The Horse Whisperer.  The character of the mother is by far the most prominent character -- though I think the film should have focused more on the girl and the horse.  The problem is that the really worthwhile scenes with the girl and the horse seem to be overshadowed by the mother and her own problems.  Most of the movie is spent focused on the mother.  Generally speaking, there just isn't enough meat to this film -- not enough depth to the characters.  I won't deny that it is very nice and worth seeing -- I gave it four stars because it is basically good.  But, it's not the sort of movie that will stick with you for very long.
0671027344|4.0|...need to give it some time. But it's an awfully good book. Sure, the kid is idiotically hyper-sensitive, but it's still a haunting and amazing look at the outcasts of high school society. I've been on both sides of that, and this is pretty dead on. read Notes from Underground next. Think Chbosky read that? You bet.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I Get Wet, by Andrew W.K. is just what the popular music scene needs to get out from under the mess of the teeny-bopper groups and the corporate rock creations.<br />So what if it doesn't have complicated lyrics, intricate musical arrangements, and political messages?  If you remember the beginnings of rock in the 1950's, you'll remember that it was about simplicity, having fun, and strumming that guitar for all it was worth.  Andrew W.K. recaptures those feelings and adds his own flair and love for partying to this great album.<br />This is what rock music is supposed to be.  Rolling Stone gave this album an excellent review in a recent issue and other critics have enjoyed it as well.  And I've heard nothing but good things from many of my fellow fans.  When the fans and the critics agree that it's a great album, chances are that it is a really GREAT ALBUM!<br />  ...Those same feelings are captured by this album.<br />This CD is something that will make you want to get up and dance, bang your head, or just sit and smile.  Party on, Andrew!!!
B000002HPV|5.0|this is a strong follow-up to post and an all-around excellent album
B00004SCX6|5.0|1. Oops I did it again- Perhaps the finest moment of pop since the Beach Boys gave us \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice.\\" <BR>I like this song as much as \\"Couldn't I Just Tell You\\" by Todd Rundgren, or  \\"In the Meantime/ Some Other Time\\" by Badfinger. In fact, maybe I even like it as much as  \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" by Paul McCartney.\\" Tough call, there. <br />2. Stronger- This is the type of song they'll be playing at weddings someday. I love it!! Strong bass line, very reminiscent of John Entwistle's bass line in \\"Try Me.\\" And, this song has almost as many chord changes as \\"Sister Disco\\" by the Who. I was quite impressed!!<br />3. Don't go knockin' on my door- At first listen, I couldn't dig this song as much as the others. But something about it just grabs you after a few listens. I like the vocal effect through the leslie organ. Kind of reminds you of \\"Beechwood Park\\" by the Zombies, or better yet, \\"Meagan's Gypsy Eyes\\" by Blood, Sweat and Tears. <br />4. (I can't get no) Satisfaction- Rumour has it that Brian Jones' son was going to play the vibes that his dad played on \\"Yesterday's Papers\\" for this recording. It fell through, but what we have here is a fine cover of one of the best songs ever written by one of the best rock groups ever. I hope that Brittany will next do covers of  \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" \\"Jig-saw Puzzle\\" and \\"Dandelion.\\" And, if it's not too much to ask, \\"Sway?\\"<br />5. Don't let me be the last to know- Perhaps the best song on the CD!! Just as Jim Morrison serenaded us with watercolors of romance on \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" Brittany does the same here with this song. Listen to the middle eight. The chord progression is very reminiscent of \\"Come Down in Time\\" by Elton John. Who thought she had it in her?<br />6. What u see (is what u get) - The only song on the CD that I just can't get into at all. Maybe it's the cutesy lyrics that I just don't like. Kind of like when the Beatles attempted \\"Leave My Kitten Alone.\\" It just didn't work. <br />7. Lucky - Wow, what a bass line!! I haven't heard anything this good since I first heard Shuggie Otis doing his thing on Zappa's Hot Rats LP. I really like the major 7 chords in the chorus, and that sweet melancholy melody. It sounds like \\"Dark is the Bark\\" by the Left Banke. <br />8. One kiss from you - Another song with Brittany just doing what she does best. Sort of like \\"In a Rainbow\\" by Sweetwater. Wow, Nansi Nevins, look out, here comes Brittany!!<br /> 9. Where are you now-  Ahh, what a sweet melody. There's nothing like a great melody. Remember \\"Untitled\\" by the Cure, and \\"Late Night\\" by Syd Barrett? The only thing missing here is a little slide guitar and a subtle accordion!!<br />11. When your eyes say it- Listen to the guitar. Those chord changes. Puts Jimi Hendrix's \\"Drifting\\" to shame. <br />12. Dear Diary- Last, but definitely not least!! I thought Lindsey Buckingham was behind this. Listen to the arrangement. Sort of like \\"That's all for Everyone.\\"
B00005OAIE|5.0|Well... I will just say the musicality of this album is wonderful... A nice fresh sound.  The lyrics work for me, and feel heartfelt.  However, the musicality is what shines.  Great voice... more reminiscent to Duncan Sheik than Dave Mathews in my opinion.  The overall sound reminds me a lot of Stevie Ray Vaughan (check out his version of Lenny... good stuff), and a smooth guitar tone of Eric Johnson, with acoustic stylings of Phil Keaggy... <BR>Great album!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Never would have heard of Norah Jones without the article in Time Magazine March 25, 2002.  Buy this album just for song 3 - Hank's Cold, Cold Heart. The remaining songs are nothing but a beautiful bonus.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter is, as we will all know if viewing this, quite the phenomenon, and the film did absolutely nothing to downplay it.  Not that it should have!  It was a positively brilliant adaptation to the book [Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone/Philosopher's Stone], and as one person said, it went quickly enough not to bore those of us who have read the book.  [For me that would be around 17 times].  The Quidditch match was...well...the most BRILLIANT bit of screenplay I have seen, EVER, I couldn't BELIEVE how cool that was!  :]  The Giant Chess Game was spectacular as well!  Everything really was, in essence, positively marvellous, and those that DIDN'T enjoy it probably haven't read the books or don't really have a hankering for Harry Potter like us hopeless HP Fans do.  :]  I cannot WAIT until the release of the DVD/Video, I saw the film seven times in the cinema and look forward with great gusto to the release of the film.  Especially the extra added features!!  The kids, yea, they did great, especially considering it was basically their first time really having a main role [the exception being Daniel Radcliffe; he played David Copperfield when he was a good deal younger, but really, it doesn't carry over if you know what I mean, as for Emma Watson (III) and Rupert Grint, it was their first time EVER acting in a film and if you ask me they did absolutely SMASHINGLY well].  Anyway, I would COMPLETELY recommend the film to ANYONE, of ANY age, ANY race, etc etc, because the magic of Harry Potter isn't just for a certain age group...it's for everyone...and gives us all a bit of hope, it really, truly does.  :]
B000002J29|5.0|When I first heard this album, \\"Three Sides Live\\" was already out.  I loved it, but \\"Seconds Out\\" really made me a true fan.  \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" and \\"I Know What I Like\\" is awesome!  But I feel the highlight of the CD is \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Los Endos\\".  The drumming is the BEST!!!
B000002BUY|5.0|This is one of Incubus' best cds...Make Yourself is my personal favorite! If you are into Incubus' newer stuff, you might be a lil suprised b/c S.C.I.E.N.C.E. has a different sound to it. <BR>My fav songs are....new skin, glass, a certain shade of green, and, favorite things..but i love the whole cd. Brandon's voice is amazing.. I can't wait to see Incubus in concert this summer!!!<BR>Buy this cd, ur Incubus collection isn't complete without it!
B00003CXGG|5.0|WOW! This movie is really quite amazing. Romeo must die is loosely based on romeo and juliet with jet li. Isn't that sweet?? Well i think it is. Romeo must die is more than a action/martial arts movie. It's a drama. It has a great script and jet li does an EXCELLENT job of acting. I rarely give martial arts movies 5 stars but this one deserves it all the way.
B0000636UN|5.0|As you might have guessed, I am an unabashed fan of Sheryl Crow and upon very close scrutiny, this CD in my humble opinion, hits the bullseye.  With this album, she has proven to me that she has got &quot;legs&quot; and will be around for a long time to come.  What she offers up this time around is far more eclectic than in the past and shows a level of maturity that she was only beginning to show in her earlier work.  To bring other well-known artists in to work with her also shows a level of confidence and comfort in her work that I haven't seen before.  Unfortunately, when an artist gets to this level of eclecticism and accomplishment, they many times don't get the kind of recognition they deserve because the DJ's don't know how to catagorize them.  In Sheryl's case, it only took four albums for her to achieve the deserved recognition.  For many others it took far more and even then they never did achieve what was due.  People in this catagory are the multi-talented singer-songwriter-musicians.  Enough said for now; suffice it to say that Sheryl has connected with me on almost all of the tracks on this album.
B000021Y77|5.0|The details of Run Lola Run have been laid out by countless reviews, and since even the unfavorable ones (very few) still<BR>seemed to like the movie I chose to rent it, then buy it, then<BR>buy the CD soundtrack. For a week I've been stuck in a loop of<BR>watching the DVD at home, listening to the CD in the car, etc.<BR>To make matters worse, I've been promoting the film to all and sundry.Why all this fuss on my part about a movie with a thin story line and short running time? Because as pure entertainment<BR>it works! Like a roller coaster ride that lasts only a short time, the viewing experience stays with you in snippets of music or flashes of video: delightful moments that won't go away but rerun in your mind. Franka Potente is wonderful as Lola, very different from actresses we're used to seeing (overseeing?)in the USA. This is definately not an art film, nor even a thriller,<BR>yet seems to embody both characteristics-it's got a different look and direction that's very refreshing. The techno soundtrack<BR>is not apart from this movie, but inextricably linked to it, to<BR>every scene, to every nuance, and difficult to get out of your head; listening to the CD brings back the movie in full minds eye detail! So when I head downstairs with a quirky grin on my face and my wife asks me where I'm going, I respond: &quot;to watch<BR>Lola run&quot; and perfectly understand her small exasperated sigh.
B000006045|5.0|Massive Attacks best album, which is saying a lot considering, the previous two.  Words aren't needed - just buy it.
6305718954|5.0|i think this movie freaked me out because it felt to me that it could acually happen. it also made me think of acually what that church is hiding. i also thought it had a very powerful message and i really loved it.
6302859204|3.0|I'm still struggling to not hold it against a movie when they take a supposedly true story, keep a basic skeleton, and basically rewrite it.  I should try to see if the movie stands on it's own.  With fiction, this is easier.  With supposed true stories, I have a bigger problem. <br />Yes, the movie strays big time when it comes to the part we really want to see, which is what Travis Walton claims to have seen in the spaceship.  The movie completely ignores that he claims to have seen human-looking creatures as well as aliens.  Why this wasn't even tried to be portrayed, I have not idea.  So if I'm seeing this big omission as something to be critical about, yes, I'm disappointed.<br />But what if I didn't know the \\"actual\\" story?  How does the film stack up on it's own.  Well, first, they spend way too much time setting up for the \\"good\\" parts.  We didn't really need to see that Travis is somewhat of a free spirit.  We don't need to see how he wants to marry his boss's sister.  And we don't need to know the chemistry of the crew he works on.  <br />What we do need to see is more time inside the spaceship.  I don't know if the movie had budget problems, but once they constructed the set, why not use it more.  And yes, throw in the human-looking creatures. And spend more time with the adventures AFTER the incident, instead of too much before it.<br />That aside, it's not that bad a movie.  We do care about the characters, and the D.B. Sweeney portray of Travis does show fear well, both as the incidents happen, as well as the aftermath.  It also shows a good performance by a pre-\\"Terminator 2\\" and pre-\\"X-files\\" Robert Patrick.  And James Garner delivers his usual comforting performance.  <br />I wish they could have seen the movie, tossed it out, and started all over again.
B00004RF9I|5.0|April 16, 2002<br />     \\"A very famous quotation from this movie is being used in a lot <BR>of reviews, and I'm not going to perpetuate it anymore!\\"<br />     If I had to pick one scriptwriter to talk to about one script, <BR>I'd pick Paddy Chayefsky and `Network.'<br />     How long did it take to write?  How many drafts?  How concrete <BR>were your concepts when you wrote it?  Is there any excised material <BR>I can look at? <BR> <BR>     I can think of no other movie that has as many great speeches <BR>as this one.  You rarely ever get more than one a film (there's some <BR>kind of unwritten rule about that, I think):  Brando's \\"I Coulda Been <BR>A Contender\\" speech from `On The Waterfront'; Duke Wayne's trail drive <BR>speech from `Red River';  any Bogart film.<BR>  <BR>     Here I count no less than four.<br />     Two are made by the character of Harold Beale on the air, <BR>summarizing for anyone who can stomach to listen the precise cost of <BR>television in our lives and upon our souls.  Another is by Max Shumacher <BR>to his cynical, destructive TV producer lady love.  It's the sort of <BR>long personal tirade that's impossible to pull off in real life, but <BR>that doesn't stop us from trying).  The fourth speech is the most <BR>devastating of the lot.  It's the \\"personal cosmology of David Jensen\\" <BR>as recited by Ned Beatty.  Consider it a primer of sorts for becoming <BR>seriously interested in giving up all hope about humanity's ability to <BR>advance itself fundamentally.<br />     You think it's easy to write this kind of movie?  Ask David Mamet, <BR>Warren Beatty, Spike Lee, and countless other filmmakers, many of whom <BR>have tried their hands at this sort of material with varying degrees <BR>of success.  Mamet came off best, I think, with the passable `Wag The <BR>Dog,' but even that film was curiously lifeless and very broad.  <BR>Beatty's `Bullworth' and Lee's `Bamboozled' missed more widely.  In <BR>fact, the only other contemporary  work that equals `Network' for its <BR>satirical power is Tom Wolfe's `Bonfire Of The Vanities.'<br />     And even then there was not this level of prognostication <BR>involved.<br />     And it's got William Holden in it, too.<br />     PEOPLE WHO'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE: everyone should.<br />     PEOPLE WHO WONT LIKE THIS MOVIE: Jerry Springer fans, watchers <BR>of Entertainment Tonight, followers of current fashion and music trends, <BR>wrestling lovers, purchasers of mass appeal magazines, and everybody <BR>else who \\"thinks like the tube, dresses like the tube, and acts like the <BR>tube\\", most of whom might become severely confused about point the movie <BR>is trying to make; also, Sidney Lumet's function as a director has always <BR>been to simply get his actors and script on screen as economically and <BR>undiluted as possible, so he's far from the most visually arresting <BR>filmmaker.
B00005Y46O|5.0|If you crave pure &amp; simple, rhythm &amp; blues, rock &amp; roll then look no further. THIS IS IT! FREE LIVE! is as clean &amp; crisp as rock &amp; roll gets.<br />The live concert venue is where Free gained their faithful followers. Free was a band in all the glory that is youth. Though the FREE LIVE! track list is limited, it is still as fully satisfying as, say, &quot;Molten Gold - The Anthology&quot; CD. That's a fairly big statement to make, but then, that's just how it is.<br />I own many Free CD(s) and am pursuing even more, and still - this is my favorite of all because of the raw &amp; unbridled sound of Free live. Free indeed had their occassional off nights, but on a good night it looked as if they were floating in the air and Paul Rodgers, Paul Kossoff, Andy Fraser &amp; Simon Kirke were joined on stage by the fifth member of Free, The spirit of the band.<br />Track 3, &quot;Be My Friend&quot;, is an especially wonderful weave of Kossoff's rippling guitar and Rodgers's fiercely unadorned voice. Undoubtedly, one of the best tracks on this recording.<br />Tracks 1 - 8 constitute the original album, FREE LIVE! All of these original 8 tracks, except &quot;All Right Now&quot; &amp; &quot;Get Where I Belong&quot;, were recorded live at Fairfield Halls, Croydon in September 1970. Track 1, &quot;All Right Now&quot;, was recorded live at Sunderland Locarno - Fillmore North in January 1970.<br />Track 8, &quot;Get Where I Belong&quot;, is an outtake from the March, 1971 &quot;My Brother Jake&quot; studio sessions. This song carries a gentle tone of wistful regret and a plea to &quot;Help me to repay things I have done wrong.&quot;<br />Tracks 9 - 14 are bonus tracks recorded from both the Sunderland &amp; Croydon shows, while Track 15 is an alternative take of &quot;Get Where I Belong&quot; recorded at Island Studios on March 26, 1971.<br />At the time, Free was on the verge of becoming extremely BIG, they just couldn't see it. These 13 live tracks capture thisfeeling very well indeed. The sad thing is that even 32 years later, this music sounding as fresh as if it were yesterday, I would give my paycheck to see these guys play live if only I could. Alas, FREE LIVE! Is the next best thing.
B00005AFVR|3.0|April 16, 2002<br />     Sadly, Bruce Springsteen has entered stasis.  While energy, <BR>commitment and passion remain his trademark qualities as a <BR>performer, he no longer surprises.  He used to break away from <BR>the script.  (Heck, he never even used to have a script.)  During <BR>his first fifteen years as a stage artist, what Bruce might do <BR>on the stage was limited to how goofy and wild he felt that <BR>night, which was invariably beyond expectations.<br />     About the worst thing I can say about `Live in NYC' is <BR>this: if you know anything about how Bruce used to perform <BR>live, it's a disappointment.<br />     I suppose if you come to it fresh, there might be an <BR>enjoyment factor, I dunno.  I can't tell anymore.<BR>     Also disappointing are the choices of song.  Many of the <BR>titles here have already been released (repeatedly) in live <BR>versions.  What's worse, the E-Street Band no longer plays <BR>songs like `Two Hearts' and 'Out In The Street' quite as fast <BR>or breakneck as they used to.  These days, they tend to plod <BR>through them.<br />     Face it, E-Street, those are a young band's songs.<br />     For the past decade, Bruce has performed only one of <BR>two ways: either acoustically, in almost a whisper, or in <BR>full-band, guitar-heavy rock mode.  `Live In NYC' is the <BR>final straw.  Bruce should find a third way of creating <BR>music.<br />     Perhaps something jazz or soul-inspired, more <BR>instrumental and experimental, like in his early days.<br />     He's capable of it.<br />     Sadly, because of releases like `Live in NYC', nobody <BR>knows that.<br />     The least of his live recordings, if one excuses the<BR> brevity of 'Chimes Of Freedom.'
B000002G6J|5.0|The best recommendation for this CD can be told in the fact that, while on a long car trip, I packed a nice selection of CDs to listen to, but this was the one that played during the entire journey!  Creed Taylor, who produced this disc, was a producer of jazz for Verve in the 60s, and his name is synonymous with excellence in jazz.  In the late 60s, early 70s, CTI, his label, came to be, and he also gave A&amp;M Records  his name in releasing some exquisite jazz discs. This disc is gorgeous, and certainly bears the stamp of never getting boring. And, Creed Taylor issued about 10 discs for A&amp;M that, like this one, have exotic, spectacular covers (photographs), which once were available  for framing. But I can only say, with some authority, that if you are looking for a disc for dinner music, to set a romantic evening, or for a cool getway journey by car, you can't go wrong with &quot;Wave&quot;. It has a sequel, &quot;Tide&quot;, equally beautiful, but &quot;Wave&quot; is better.<BR>Madge Bruner Hazen
B00000DHTF|4.0|April 16, 2002<br />     Four albums of throwaways and you know what's amazing?<br />     Some of the best stuff remains STILL unreleased.<br />     `Tracks' gets it about half right, which means there's <BR>plenty on here to be happy about.  Here's a disc by disc <BR>analysis:<br />     Disc One. In her early days, Bruce wrote long.  He also <BR>wrote sentimentally.  Most of the songs on Disc One are youth <BR>epics, an acquired taste.  But if you can love that form, <BR>and I do, they can't help but energize.  `Give The Girl A <BR>Kiss' is pure soul.  `Hearts Of Stone' would be the first <BR>dance at my wedding (although this version is not quite as <BR>good as some bootlegs out there).<br />     Disc Two.  If Bruce's early period was sentimental, <BR>naïve and experimental, his work in the late seventies reaped <BR>the benefit.  Four or five of the songs on Disc Two (like <BR>`Where The Bands Are' and `Ricky Wants A Man (Of Her Own)') <BR>are as good as party rock has ever got.  Marry what's on <BR>this CD to some of the cuts on `The River' (like `Sherry <BR>Darling') and the stuff he wrote for Gary U.S. Bonds (found <BR>on the LPs `Dedication' and `Loves On The Line') and you <BR>begin to realize that the Bruce Springsteen of the late <BR>seventies and early eighties was, without argument, the <BR>finest `party rock' songwriter who ever lived.  This disc <BR>almost makes the full price of the box set worth it.<br />     Disc Three.  As Bruce begins to settle down, his <BR>arrangements begin to strangle.  He's still playful, and in <BR>the process of becoming rock's best balladeer and one of <BR>its best social marksman, but a rigidity is starting to develop.  <BR>Rockabilly and folk became very important to him, and it <BR>shows in the playing here. <br />     Disc Four.  After winning his Oscar for `Streets Of <BR>Philadelphia' Bruce decided that \\"important\\" songs should be <BR>minimal--minimal in lyrics and minimal in arrangement.  <BR>Certainly Bruce can paint some truly great images and can <BR>say more about human nature in fewer words than any other <BR>living songwriter, but the endless repetition of his new <BR>style wears on the listener.<br />     Some of this is truly great work (about 40% of it)<BR>but that ratio holds true for all of Bruce's studio work.
B000056V73|2.0|This movie was pretty boring. I thought the best scene was during the near plane crash. Jimmy Fallon did a good turn as the supporting character. I could have cared less what happened to the main character as he was way too removed and bit of a [weakling].<BR>Kate Hudson's \\"star making perfomance\\" seemed to mainly consist of traipsing around with a knowingly annoying smirk. There were some good bits but they were far and few between. Viewers would be better served by viewing any number of documentaries about the Stones or the Who.
B000002513|5.0|April 16, 2002<br />     Epic songwriting.  Entirely too sentimental.  Something<BR>of a studio travesty, but still beautiful.<br />     This is what it's like to be young and alive and in love <BR>and living through the blazing heat of a summer.  Not so much <BR>in real life, but in your mind.  The locations are endless,<BR>the portraits grandiose, the mixture of styles inspired.<BR> <BR>     As with all of Bruce's albums, the material is better <BR>listened to live, especially once Max Weinberg joined the band <BR>and steadied the drumming.<br />This album was meant to duplicate in the studio the <BR>endless bar-shouters that were becoming young Bruce's <BR>trademark.  The initiative mostly failed, but much of the <BR>energy is still there.  Non-Bruce fans might be suprised by <BR>his sound at this stage in his development.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|There were some funny parts, but not really worth the money I spent to rent it. Don't get me wrong, I love Ben Stiller, but this movie didn't bring out his true comedic talents. It kinda seemed to me like he was trying to make his own Austin Powers. That's just my opinion. The idea of the movie is funny, and it did make me laugh at some points, but Ben Stiller can do so much better. Sorry Ben!
0843178140|5.0|What happens when Little Miss Giggles loses her giggle?  No, she doesn't seek out a psychoanalyst or start popping Prozac!  She hooks up with Mr. Happy and they have quite the amusing adventure that becomes the Quest of the Lost Giggle.  Amusing and droll for children of all ages.  ;O)
B00003CY6M|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's a great love story, and it's different from most of them. It has a great story to it, if only life was really like that. Letting the hands of fate determine who you are going to be with and who your love will be. John Cusack did a great job as usual. I loved Jeremy Piven as the part of his best friend, he is hilarious! Not a sappy moment in the whole movie. The ending was good, but predictable, I mean of course they're going to get together, this is a romantic movie we are talking about here. This movie is full of parts that make you go &quot;They're so close!&quot; Loved it!
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather is by far the greatest story of all time and one of few movies to be a good interpretation of a novel. The Godfather series is overall incredibly swat!

0062502182|2.0|After I read 'Veronica Decides To Die' I was a little bit disappointed and decided to read a second book by Coelho to form a steadier opinion about this author. And I read 'The Alchemist'. But after that I find 'Veronica Decides To Die' better than 'The Alchemist' and what I considered it to be before reading 'The Alchemist'.<br />I enjoyed the first pages very much because I had the impression that this is a very good retaled fable with some touches that make you think about some aspects of life. But my disappointment began to grow bigger and bigger after discovering that the message of the book is pretty much the same as it is in 'Veronica Decides To Die' and gets more and more banal - an opinion of mine confirmed by the fact that from a moment further development of the main idea simply stops and a boring repetition begins. And the pity is that it looks like Coelho has stressed on the philosophical side of his tale, thus making from the book an average story, related in a boring way.<br />I think Coelho has a style of his own. His quotes from the Bible are in place. I was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of a Biblical character in the form of Melchizedek which makes the book more 'provocative', but the problem is that the author is too monotonous. Some people may fall in love with the book while some will totally dislike. That depends on the person himself.<br />I myslef, don't like it very much. Find a lot of gaps in its message which in some places tend to be ridiculous (trying to convince your heart, looking upon all the facts as omens...). Don't like the way such an naive story tries to provoke the reader to think too.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Having not seen it since it was in the theater, I forgot just how good \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" is.  The story of each of the women is personal and engaging.  Different lives and pasts leading to the same destination, each road is harsh and lined with perils.  The film is a nice blend of period piece and modern drama.<br />I love the dialog (\\"She will know I am waiting like a tiger in the trees, now ready to leap out and cut her spirit loose.\\")  Visually, the film is almost too pretty.  The women are all heart-breakingly beautiful, and each setting is dream-like in it's perfection.  However, what could be a flaw is a strength, due largely to the quality of the actors.  Each of the characters is strong and individual.<br />It is a very touching story of mothers and daughters, of hopes and fears.  One of my favorite character actors, Victor Wong, even has a small part.  A good film all around.
B00005JKYS|3.0|You'll probably want to see this movie for one of three reasons: you like Mel Gibson (and his acting is very good), you want to further examine the Vietnam \\"mess\\", or you like realism in your war movies.<br />If you live outside the USA you may not enjoy this movie. It appears to be another attempt at making America feel better about itself over the Vietnam war. I couldn't help but feel nauseous during all the patriotic time-wasting that happens prior to the soldiers leaving for Vietnam, and the scenes back at base with the families left behind... (and what was it with Madeleine Stowe's lips....talk about a collagen over-injection, she looked like a Muppet!)<br />The war/conflict scenes are well edited, but the level of violence is unwarranted. I'm not a prude, I rate Saving Private Ryan highly for its realism (versus movies such as the drawn out Longest Day) - but We Were Soldiers goes too far. Are they trying to shock you, or desensitise you to violence? The latter in my opinion.<br />The movie script follows many conventions of Hollywood films - but falls down on its need to constantly push the patriotism button. <br />Acceptable if you \\"love\\" films about Vietnam...
B00005JKED|4.0|I love this movie because it takes the overdone, Stereo-typical, Police Buddy Movie and turns it inside out. I think that Denzel's work here is absolutely spellbinding and Mr. Hawkes' performance outstanding.  Incredibly tight editing makes this movie zip along at a breakneck pace and you feel that it all happens in a day. The script is &quot;in you face&quot; but strangely subtle and it will take at least two viewings to see that everything is revealed about  Denzel's character through what he says but the non-street wise Ethan can't see it .  Ethan's talent shines because he makes you believe what his character, however reluctantly, wants to believe ... that these methods may just be &quot;how you fight crime in the real world&quot;.  <br />The choice of Denzel Washington was brillant.  His entire body of work lets you accept the things he does  because he's Denzel and he a nice Guy. Denzel deserved the Oscar for this one!!  <br />As much as I loved the movie I didn't give it 5 stars because I feel the end of the movie suffers from certain allowances  made for Ethan Hawkes' character;  perhaps it was done for the sake of his &quot;celebrity&quot; or the fact that Hollywood deems it necessary to have a hero in all it's movies and, of course, that hero must  win in some way, shape or fashion.   If there is anything that will keep this movie from being considered a great Classic like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Memento&quot; it's the refusal to let the &quot;Bad Guy&quot; win.  I'm not saying I want the bad guy to win but it became forced and contrived which lowered (IMHO) it to a &quot;B&quot; movie. Especially when his real comuppence is already foreshadowed throughout the movie.   <br />For those who don't like this I understand because Denzel has never played such a thoroughly dispicable character before and some people can't accept  &quot;John Wayne&quot; as anything else.   Then there are those who feel that since it shows police as being out of control and that's just to unbelieveable for some.  I can only say that this story was surely inspired from recent LAPD events that revealed there were Cops involved in some pretty astounding crimes... From Bank robbery to the assination of  &quot;Biggy Smalls&quot;.
B000002GAF|5.0|With no less than 5 hits, this is without a doubt Gino's finest hour! Appoloosa, The river must flow, I just wanna stop, Brother to brother, (and my favorite) Wheels of life, make this album a must for anyone who wants to start buying Gino Vannelli cds.
B000001OAA|5.0|I just love Garbage, they have such a unique style that I can't find in other bands that makes me have to at least here one song of there's a day. I've had this particular album for about four years and I have their others too and I have to say this is my favorite even though Version 2.0 comes close. Each song has a great and unique and dark edge that I cannot find in every song on their other albums, but don't get me wrong, I love their other two albums as well. Here's a song by song review of this awesome album...<BR>SUPERVIXEN: to be honest, i usually skipped this song at first but now it's one of my favorites. catchy dark chorus makes me love this song.<BR>...: god, i love this song and the video, it's so dark and even though it's not even that hardcore or anything, somethin about it gives me goosebumps<BR>ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS: ah yes, the song that made me a Garbage fan, this was my anthem for a while when i was dealing with depression<BR>AS HEAVEN IS WIDE: i love these lyrics! i can so relate to what shirley's feeling in this song having been betrayed and it's just fabulous!<BR>NOT MY IDEA: kinda weak compared to the first four tracks but it's still very catchy and still very good in my book<BR>A STROKE OF LUCK: one of those songs you have to listen to a couple times to appreciate it, but it's slow dark atmosphere will leave you captivated by it's beauty<BR>VOW: yes! my favorite song on the album, it took a while to grow on me, but the chorus just says it all, i love to sing this one loud and think of everyone that's betrayed me and my revenge :)<BR>STUPID GIRL: one of their most popular songs and a good one, the only problem i have with it is i feel it's been overplayed, which is a shame because i still love this song :(<BR>DOG NEW TRICKS: kinda repetitive, but i still love the words cuz i again can relate to someone who lies just to make things look more dramatic than they are, it's great<BR>MY LOVER'S BOX: a lot of people found this one annoying but i think it's one of the best tracks instrumentally, a good one to listen to on headphones<BR>FIX ME NOW: in my opinion, the weakest on the album, but i still like this song cuz it's catchy, so i pretty much don't have a problem with any song on this album cuz i think this is the worst and i still like it<BR>MILK: great ballad to end with with the haunting \\"I'm waiting for you\\" message.<BR>An awesome album that i think should be found on everyone's shelf and in CD players, cuz this trip is worth taking.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I loved the Lion King it is definitely one of my favoritest Disney movies (and I have almost all of the animated ones) In my opinion this is one of the best in the past ten years if not 100 years.  Just a comment to \\"A viewer from Oklahoma United States \\" Just to let that person know that Disney is putting Beauty and the Beast out on DVD October 8, 2002 with three different versions of the film (original, special edition, and one other i can't remember).  Then later this year they are supposed to rerelease the Lion King (probably in a special ed.) and will most likely be released on dvd next year in October (like how Snow White was released this year).  Thanks for your time!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has been in the music biz a bit in the electronica circuit a bit.  He tried his hand at &quot;Rock&quot;....BIG MISTAKE!  His debut album with V2 Records breathed new life to the artist Moby and kaching! ching! on his best selling album to date &quot;Play&quot;.  At least half of the music on &quot;Play&quot; may have been used in popular 30 second commercials, and used in movie trailers. Other than that, Moby's music on &quot;Play&quot; will get you hooked. He is a wild innovator and I look foward to his newest confections of goodies that await in &quot;18&quot; coming in May 2002.
B00005N9CV|3.0|This album is another step down the road from serious jazz to pure pop. And, frankly, I think a step too far. Krall still has a great voice and great piano, and still surprises me and pleases me with her changes in rhythm and punctuation, but the strings just bury the whole thing. Enough, already. I don't say go back, since that's futile -- but ditch the orchestra at least some of the time, please!
B00004X01U|4.0|Any album releases by Madonna is always a must have in anyones collection.  Madonna is like a chameleon always changing and a step ahead in her approach towards her music.  Madonna shocked everyone with her fabu take on electronica in \\"Ray Of Light\\". As for her latest release \\"Music\\" Madonna , I still love her dearly  but the vibe on \\"Music\\" is WAAAY to mellow here. There is some good songs on the album including \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl..\\" and \\"Dont Tell Me\\".  But thumbs down on the tracks \\"Nobodys Perfect\\"....aacckkk!!  Madonna sounds like she is being strangled...ick!!!!...
6305657947|5.0|Yes, we are die-hard fans of Remington Steele, and Pierce Brosnan's tyrst with Rene Russo scintillates compared to his sparring with Laura (Stephanie Zymbalist I still love you) so many years ago - our favorite sitcom back then.  Bored with the successes of corporate raiding, Thomas Crown (Brosnan) commits the ulimate beautiful crime by removing a Monet from the Museum of Art only to be pursued by an equally beautiful bounty hunter (Russo).  From worthy adversaries, these two mirror images of each other banter and tease in a jet set game of cat and mouse.  Slowly they realize the game is turning and the stakes far exceed just the latest challenge and thrill in their previously emtpy lives.  Almost believable, this movie is as shallow - or deep - as the viewer chooses.  Listen to the banter, listen carefully, and enjoy!
0440219078|4.0|The Giver is a great science fiction book written by Lois Lowry.  This book is about a boy named Jonas and his family in a perfect world.  Jonas does not like this world but he cannot leave.  When the children become twelve they become adults.  They also get their first job.  Jonas's job is to become the Receiver of the town's memory.  This makes his life even harder.  Now he wants to escape.  <br />     I loved how Lois Lowry described this setting in this detailed book.  In one part of this book Jonas receives a memory from the Giver about snow, which Jonas has never experienced.  He feels the Giver's old, frail hand touch his bare back.  All of a sudden, Jonas feels the room grow cold.  He also starts to feel tiny pin pricks on his back.  He then realizes that the Giver told him it was snow.  I think that is a great setting description for that memory.  When Jonas learns about love, the Giver puts his frail hand back on his bare back again.  Then all of a sudden Jonas is in a warm room with a fire in the fireplace.  Then he sees multiple children and parents.  He turns and sees two elderly people.  He thinks to himself, \\"This is an odd family unit.\\"  He feels something in the room but can't quite grasp it.  Then the Giver says that it is love.  I know this makes me want to read the book more.  <br />     A perfect world is not always good.  To make this a perfect world, they had to take out many things such as color, memory, love, hope, fear, and hate.  Imagine a world like this.  The author might like this world because she wanted perfection but I think that some people would not like this world.  I know that I wouldn't like this world.  <br />     The Giver has a strange ending but has an interesting twist at the end that makes it exciting.  I understood this book because of the themes.  For example, love cannot be artificial and a perfect world is not always good.  I also understood this book because of the settings. Without these in the book, I would be lost.This book has good details and an interesting plot.  It was a good book because it made me feel differently about perfection.  I give it two thumbs up.  You should read this book too.
B000050IE6|5.0|After being turned on to Opeth earlier this year by the stunning 'Blackwater Park', I am slowly working my way through the Opeth volumes. And I do mean slowly since each CD seems to have enough to chew on for months!<br />I didn't think BWP could be topped, but after many listens, I am starting to think Still Life comes out slightly on top. The reason is that Still Life seems to cover an ever broader spectrum of music - metal to rock to even jazz. When it's all put together it creates something thats both haunting and amazing - certainly never boring. Only on an Opeth CD will heavy riffs with growling vocals turn into an acoustic song with clean vocals, then seamlessly meld back and forth into heavy again. I also like the fact that the guitar work on Still Life seems more complex, with more prominent and longer solos.<br />But the thing I love best about Opeth is the abilty to create progressive music, while still staying true to the song. Many bands can create music that goes all over the map, but it takes true talent to construct progressive songs that can retain a theme or feeling throughout them, and I think Opeth does a great job of this.<br />And don't be put off by the 'death metal vocals'. Like many, I used to have very negative sterotypes about mindless screaming vocals, but Mikael Akerfeldt will show you just how bad most of the rest are. This is not mindless screaming, but growling of lyrics. Its done for a reason, and I guarantee you that in time you won't even be able to imagine the songs WITHOUT the growling vocals. And the contrasts with the clean vocals help make Opeth a truely amazing listening experience.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|This Year's Model was Elvis Costello's second album and his first with the Attractions.  Mr. Costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock, but unlike most punk bands that were unskilled musicians that thrived on energy, he has an unbelievable sharp pen and a great ear for melody.  The album opens with the fierce &quot;No Action&quot; that in fine punk form clocks in at less than two minutes.  &quot;This Year's Girl&quot; is wry take on the fame machine.  &quot;The Beat&quot; has a catchy organ riff and is Mr. Costello's look at self-gratification.  &quot;Pump It Up&quot; is a fiery track as is &quot;Lip Service&quot;.  &quot;(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea&quot; has a manic verve while &quot;Little Triggers&quot; slows things down.  &quot;Radio Radio&quot; is the most famous off the album, but the album's best track is &quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot;.  The song has a thumping bass line that shuffles along until a frenzied close.  This Year's Model gave further proof that Elvis Costello may well be the king.
078062999X|2.0|Kenneth Branagh has done some wonderful work, and his king in Henry V is a most excellent portrayal, but this personal ego machine called Hamlet should be avoided.<br />His interpretation serves only to draw attention to the fine acting job done by all those around him, who seem to remember they are not actors playing characters played by actors, but are simply actors playing people. Branagh chews up every scene, trying desperately to move his face and mouth as much as possible, conveying to us the torture of Hamlet's soul via the torture of the lines and the scenery.<br />The quintessential Hamlet in my opinion is the snippets from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead: subdued, confused, a man with inner demons that play out in emotional mood swings, not the brash, juvenile, infantile, screaming wide-mouthed fool as played by Branagh.<br />I can't even make it past the first tape anymore. I just cringe each time Branagh starts to open his mouth to make that strange loud face of his.<br />Far too much &quot;star&quot; power in this film, and not nearly enough care for the script. Despite Branagh's claim to recontextualize Elizabethan English, I find it harder to understand here than on a high school stage, because of all the incidental and unnecessary inflection and emotion put into the lines.<br />Methinks he doth profess too much, and leaves too little emotion to our imaginations.
B000063DIR|1.0|This is a \\"remastered\\" version of the original in which they (Ozzy and Sharon) have removed the work of bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake, whose playing was (and remains) so instrumental to the success of these records. This was done out of spite and is so sick as to be almost beyond belief. If these records ever meant anything to you - and if they still do - DO NOT BUY THESE REMASTERS!!!!!
B00005JKJA|2.0|I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I was really looking forward to getting this film on DVD.  Upon release, I picked up the disc and only after throwing it in my player did I realize there is no scene selection menu!  What's up with that?  No jumping to a scene for this disc!  Maybe its in the works for the \\"limited collector's special hard to find\\" version.  Great movie, but being spoiled by just about every other DVD that have more features than they deserve, the very least Universal should have done was provide scene selection. It is one of the best features of DVD.  Oddly enough, letterbox, sub-titles & languages (Spanish and French) are in tact.
B00005JKDR|5.0|In a practice which is know customary for me.  I go and watch movies before I take my children to them.  Simply because you don't know what might be even in an animated movie nowadays. It really is a great movie.  It is extremely entertaining.  The voice talents of john goodman and billy crystal work perfect for the charachters.  The animation is top notch.  I truly feel that the next Pixar film that comes out won't require a screening.  I wish i could say the same for the next disney production.  The only problem with monsters inc is the end because you just want to see more!!!
B0000636UN|4.0|i liked the new album espically the first half.  It is the perfect summer album.  I really liked the song c'mon c'mon a song sherly sings with Stevie Nicks it is very good with a upbeat rock meoldy.  Of course i like soak up the sun the perfect outdoor summer song. Also I like Steve McQueen the first song on the cd.  The only thing i would of liked better is if she had ended the cd on a more happier note Weather Channel is a beautiful song but it kind of left me depressed. Overall I really liked the cd I have listen to it at least 4 times since getting it yesturday.
B00003CY6M|3.0|Oh Kate, of the enormous white teeth and John of raven hair, black as night! Who couldn't watch these two for a few hours, even though they rarely appear on screen together? But  the pair with the greatest chemistry in this movie are real-life best friends John Cusack and Jeremy Piven. Piven gets to use his acting chops a bit more here than he did in a similar best-buddy role in Family Man, and to good advantage. He is the emotional underpinning of this movie, and the only one who seems to really learn anything. Piven deserves to be moved up from supporting actor to lead roles, and soon. Another secondary character worth watching is Northern Exposure vet John Corbett, showing good sportsmanship as a godawful new-age musician/entertainer. Corbett's character is the only truly new addition to a plot cobbled from many others mentioned by other reviewers. The scene where he is watching his own music video for the first time is the funniest in the movie.<br />The director spares us from bothersome breakups with the cruelly tossed aside fiances, who must do all their wailing and gnashing off camera. How un-flattering that would be to the glossy leads! And as a book collecter I had to laugh at Cusack's obsessive legwork in search of a certain copy of Love in the Time of Cholera, which he could have probably found in a few phone calls after a half-hour internet search. <br />Enjoy this movie for charming characters and a light romance--just don't think about it too much!
B000059HB7|5.0|Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, Brennan...what else does a western classic need?  Oh, okay, an evil posse, recovering alcoholics, great one-liners, a guy named Dude, and plenty of sexual inuendo.  Well, that's all in this movie.  Great western, great film.
6302548195|5.0|If you do not own your copy of this movie you better find one fast! This Rhino version is the UNCUT version! I have been looking everywhere for it, most of the Blockbusters have discontinued it. The best movie ever created about bodybuilding! Arnold looks AWESOME! He is in great shape, it is such a nice change from the current bodybuilding scene! Find it....... buy it....... and watch it over and over! Only purchase the NTSC version by RHINO, the \\"imports\\" are not the same movie and have poor quality. The Rhino versions are VERY RARE!!!! I am still looking for a good quality video, all I find are the \\"imports\\", everyone I have talked to will not sell their Rhino copy. If you find one that is in good quality BUY IT! It will only go UP in value!!!!
B000063DIR|1.0|What bothers me about this new reissue of Diary of a Madman? There is absolutely no indication on the outside of the CD that THE ENTIRE RHYTHM SECTION HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED. <br />I am not going to speculate why these albums were re-recorded. I could care less if Sharon thought Kerslake was a jerk. It seems it would have been simpler to credit Daisley and Kerslake in the first place. <BR> <BR>But anyway, what's done is done, and we are now left with an album that is sonically equivalent to the Mona Lisa, if the bottom half were done completely in crayolas. No offense meant towards the new rhythm section. For the most part, they do a fine job mimicking the original tracks. The problem is the recording of the new tracks, and the subsequent mixdown are a mess. The new drums are tuned and processed completely differently and sound very dry and sterile when compared to the originals. The bass guitar sounds boomy and intrusive at times and the songs seem to increase and decrease in fidelity as the guitars/vocals come in or go out. <br />If for whatever reason you must buy this new version of Diary, or you receive it as a gift, be sure to check out the clunky new drum intro to \\"Little Dolls\\". It's the icing on the cake of this jaw dropping, head shaking extravaganza.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Beautiful rendering of this timeless classic. Fantastic extras. Roger Ebert's commentary is the best I ever heard. Offers great insight for this movie. But a question: who drugged Peter Bogdanovitch for his commentary and why did they include it? He offers nothing other than assist those who are visually impaired by describing the action and sometimes simply repeating dialogue. <br />Whether or not this is the Greatest movie ever or not--or what that means to begin with--this DVD is worth the money many times over.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is my favorite Who album. Each song has its own personality. I think this album speaks well with kids my age. I'm 15, and I understand what they were talking about. Whenever I hear Baba O'Riley, I think of this utopia where kids just hang around, do drugs, have sex, and talk all the time. Bargain's pretty cool, even though it's used for a car commercial. I hate that. Love Ain't For Keeping is a nice folk-blues tune. Then there's My Wife. Weird tune, but it's cool. When The Song's over sounds like The Who trying to be Yes. It does succeed. Getting In Tune has some cool piano stuff, and it's somewhat bluesy. Going Mobile is a good highway tune, with a very catchy chorus. Behind Blue Eyes is a nice ballad that's very poetic. Then there's Won't Get Fooled Again. A great rocker about revoltion. Very cool stuff in that song. Great album.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie has got to be the best I have seen to date. I have the utmost respect for the guys that actually did that in real life. A very realistic movie , will definitely get it when it comes out on dvd. A must for any military action film fan!!!!
B0000636UN|5.0|i dig everything about this record, from the music, to the cool A NIGHT AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION-style font. i wouldn't wanna imagine how dissapointed i'd be if this record were a sham, but it's been clear from her first record that sheryl crow is too good for that. really too good.<br />the record's first track, steve mcqueen, kicks things off in fine shape. the only thing i really know about steve mcqueen is that he was name-checked by some awkward girl on the television show, 7th heaven. that not withstanding, the next song, soak up the sun, is the first single dropped from the album. finally i have the pleasure of hearing the song that my friends with vh1 have all been bragging about- .<br />the rest of the album is equally great, packed with loud guitars, sweet vocals, and all-around great summer rock. i'd go into some detail about the unusual juxstaposition between the lyrics and the music, but i've got a college application burning a hole in my desk. do yourself a favor...
B000002U8G|5.0|As far as Pink Floyd goes, no matter how bad of a rap an album has gotten or under what circumstances it is made, there is always at least one remarkable song.  One that either moves you in or out or drives you to think of far off places or times past.  <br />In &quot;Meddle,&quot; Pink Floyd has a song for every attitude:  poolside, bedside, outside; sitting in rapt contemplation or laughing with friends.  From powerful, beating bass rhythms to almost country/folkish overtones, &quot;Meddle&quot; is certainly no &quot;The Wall&quot; or &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; but it provides the same outstanding musicianship for the more eclectic listener.
0800177177|5.0|A milestone of film-making, Francis Ford Coppola's version of \\"Dracula\\" is more than a horror movie. Is a royal piece of art and a master class of History of Cinema.<br />Coppola uses the novel by Bram Stoker as an excuse to pay homage to horror classics like \\"Nosferatu\\", \\"The Wolfman\\", \\"The Mist\\", and \\"The Exorcist\\". The director also wished to give a great amount of dignity to the story, so he filled the screen with excellent performances, and what better way to do it than confronting two great actors like Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins, opposing each other as The Vampire and The Hunter? Both of them are superb in their roles, and both of them surprise you with interesting twists near the film's climax: Dracula, in the beginning seen as a blood-thirsty monster, turns out to be a creature redeemed by love. As for Doctor Van Helsing, there comes a time when we stop seeing him as a rational man of science. The good doctor turns out to be more of a sorcerer than a hero, a madman set on pursuit of the horrible monster that's consumed his whole existence. The final confrontation between these two premises is what gives the film its purpose, and that showdown will take place in the person of Mina Harker, played by a brilliant (and unusually sexy) Wynona Rider.<br />But besides this serious stuff, the movie also includes a very subtle, yet effective, sense of humor, portrayed by the three suitors of Lucy Westenra (I like to call them \\"The Three Stooges\\" because I find them so funny!), and a strong sexual content (all the scenes between Dracula and Mina are filled with sexual symbols) that reaches a high peak in the classic scene when Jonathan Harker is seduced by three vampire vixens (look for a pre-\\"Malena\\" Monica Bellucci). It's a shame, however, that Keanu Reeves seems a little miscast as Jonathan, since his performance doesn't reach the quality of his costars's.<br />Because of its artistic quality, is a sin to see such a good movie packed in such a... DVD. Image and sound are very good (specially the sound, which is one of the film's best achievements), but the absolute lack of special features and the extremely poor presentation make this a mediocre edition. We could have appreciated some director commentaries, a picture gallery, a making-of documentary or even some bios for the main stars. The subject of Dracula (both the novel and the historical figure) have produced many documentaries, any of which would have made this DVD an excellent acquisition. None of these things are there. Is nice to see Spanish Subtitles (why there were also in Korean, I'll never know), and I must say that ALL Region 1 DVD's should have them!<br />If you loved the movie and wish to see it in its full image and sound splendor, then this is for you. However, you'll be disappointed by the lack of features. I still don't know why they did it like this. Could it be that this was not a popular movie when it came out? I refuse to think so.e and sound are very good (specially the sound, which is one of the film's best achievements), but the absolute lack of special features and the extremely poor presentation make this a mediocre edition.

079073804X|5.0|First released in 1973, \\"The Exorcist\\" still remains the scariest horror movie of all time, at least in my opinion. The new version (with deleted scenes and new special effects) was not as good as the original, because the new stuff damaged the climate that the movie had. That's why I recommend this version: it has new remastered sound and images, but it doesn't add any new fancy shots, leaving you the experience perfect as it was.<br />In the words of its director, William Friedkin, \\"The Exorcist\\" is so scary because it looks very real. He wanted to do a movie that felt more like a serious documentary rather than just another horror flick. He definitely hit the jackpot with William P. Blatty's awesome screenplay, as well as great performances by Jason Miller and Linda Blair (whose acting career never recovered from this role). So many things have been said about \\"The Exorcist\\" that I can't possibly think of saying anything new on the subject.<br />This DVD edition is one of the best ever. It is (as all DVD's should be) literally packed with special features: theatrical trailers, bios and filmographies for the main stars, deleted scenes, a text about the actual events that inspired the movie, and an excellent 1-hour making-of documentary made for British television.<br />If you're a fan of this movie, this edition is THE ONE for you. If you are one of the few that never saw it (personally, I wasn't even born when it was released), then this should be a good opportunity for you to view a classic in the horror genre. And as Friedkin said: \\"turn off the lights, turn up the sound...\\"
B0000060NH|4.0|Never has the attitude and vibe of early 70's soul been captured so completely, in a package obscure enough to impress.  To listen to this album is to float away into an anti-paradise where 'bad' is good and out of sour inner-city realities come forth sweet forbidden pleasures.  The grooves in these grooves prove that there was more to Black Pride than big hair.  In fact the way they rise above the pulp that spawned them and into timelessness captures that spirit better than a thousand rallies.<br />OK.  Artsiness aside, this is world-class mood music.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's so short (38 minutes).  Surely some good stuff ended up on the cutting room floor when they were putting the LP together.  Maybe out of reverence to the late, perfectionistic Mr. Gaye, they left it as is.  But I want to live in this musical world longer!  Oh well, there's always the Repeat button.
B000000OUJ|4.0|The GZA has created the best Wu-Tang solo cd of the Wu. There are a couple of cuts like &quot;Cold World&quot;, &quot;Duel of the Iron Mic&quot;, and the classic single &quot;Shadowboxing&quot;. Althought this album was released in 1995, this ablum still bangs. Althought this album, has a small setback of shotty production, about one or two tracks, this album is close to a classic.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is among the top Hitchcock films. I have seen Shadow of a Doubt, The Birds, Strangers on a Train, Dial M For Murder, Rope, and The Man Who Knew Too Much which were very good films. But none of them can even come close to the sheer brilliance and the excellence of Rear Window. I first saw Rear Window about a year ago and I can remember being enthralled, thrilled, and very entertained by it. I would consider Rear Window to be one of the most chilling movies Hitchcock ever made. I remember feeling a little nervous when Raymond Burr came over to Jeff's apartment to try to kill him and Jeff was totally defensless. I also loved the wit, and style of this film. Grace Kelly was as beautiful as ever in Rear Window. Stella who was the nurse really made me laugh with all of her wisecracks. I can't praise Rear Window enough. Buy the DVD and watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B00005RFAI|1.0|The album is for (stupid) children. Expect nothing creative from Pink's music; it's meaningless, adolescent ranting at its worst. I can't believe music companies and &quot;producers&quot; would actually release this disease into the world. God help us all.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|I like family-love movie very much. From the view point of a father, this movie is excellent. In the movie Frank saved his son, John, who was just murdered, at the last scene. I was moved by the great love of a father.  Probably I wouldn't show my love to my sons as much as Frank. In Japan mothers usually take care of children and fathers aren't good at showing their love to family members. So a father tends to be isolated from his family. Of course I am always concerned about my family. But I don't tell them my concerns directly. So my affections aren't handed to them. <BR> I think Frank is a father of fathers. I try to imitate Frank. The movie tells me an important role of a father.
0425107469|2.0|Sometimes saying \\"classic\\" is supposed to mean good things.  Not in this case. This is the typical Dean Koontz theme.  Bad government labs create mutant good and bad creatures.  Overly intelligent dog that somehow is as insightful as humans.  It was nice the first two times I read Koontz but frankly he is just too much of a formula writer to be read often.  On the rare occassion that he goes beyond this formula it seems ok.  Unfortunatly he is pretty much stuck on this theme.  God forbid that there were never government labs, Dean would be out of a job.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This film has got to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen. The movie gives you the story of 5 teenage kids out in a log cabin then the unexpected evil comes out lurking in the woods (Brought out by a tape player speaking out a foreign language) and then Evil starts to come out before them. Sure the plot might be dumb for some people (But hey, its usually the plot for most horror films anyway). Sure the actors might seem cheesy at some points, but hey, the movie just gives you the entertainment without even trying. I recommend having people over your house and watch this movie. Yell out predictions. Make fun of it if you like. Laugh when you feel like. With horrific features and humor mixed in, this is one film you shouldn't miss.
0380973650|2.0|I am a fan of the Sandman series, but American Gods was a disapointment.  It felt as though a good story had been overstretched.
6305841861|5.0|The same evil comes back when Ash and his girlfriend go to another log cabin and find a tape player and a book (sounds familiar). After the tape player speaks, the evil comes back. Coming back with new laughs, new jumps, and new entertainment. While Ash is fighting off evil, 4 other characters walk through the woods to find the cabin and half of the characters want the book of the dead. Ash is then finally confronted by them and are not suspecting the evil that lurks over them. <br />Most of the film is hilarious. Ash's hand gets taken over by evil. The raping tree comes back (just a prediciton I made from the first film), and Ash gets [irate]. Just so that some people don't get confused and all about this film guessing if it's a remake or a sequal. To me, I think its a mix. But anyway, after you watch the first one, you wouldn't want to waste time and not watch the second. You'll have a blast.
B0000636UN|5.0|This is a fantastic album from seasoned musician and songwriter, Sheryl Crow.  After a four-year wait, we have been well-rewarded with an album composed of light fun songs, hard- hitting rockers and soulful ballads.  <br />Many well-known and respected artists appear on this album with Ms. Crow.  Stevie Nicks sings on the title track, \\"C'mon C'mon\\" and \\"Diamond Road\\".  Lenny Kravitz on \\"You're An Original\\".  Don Henley on \\"It's So Easy\\".  Emmylou Harris on \\"Weather Channel\\".  Gwyneth Paltrow on \\"It's Only Love\\", which is an instrumentally richer version of the song written by Crow for Stevie Nicks that appears on Nicks' \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\".<br />\\"Soak Up The Sun\\", \\"Steve McQueen\\" and \\"Lucky Kid\\" are radio blasting, convertible songs.  However, this album is more than just great rock and roll.  The songs \\"Safe And Sound\\" and \\"Weather Channel\\" remind us just how serious and heart-felt this songstress can be--as if we needed to be reminded.<br />Many members of Sheryl's tour band play on this studio recording.  Peter Stroud and Tim Smith appear frequently on a variety of guitars and vocals, while Lorenza Ponce and Matt Bruebeck add strings.<br />I strongly recommend this album to die-hard Sheryl Crow fans and those who are unfamiliar with her almost ten-year catalog of material.  A great album from one of the industry's most accomplished musicians.
B0000074GK|5.0|I read a review comparing this band to bands such as Zeppelin, Bad Company and the likes.  I completely agree, and like Bad Company, they had no gimmicks.  The astounding thing about this group of guys, is that they never exploded onto the scene as the next great sensation (something to do with the Seattle rock scene, and having next to nothing in common what was going on there).  There's nothing fancy about the music they write and play.  It's straightforward, heartfelt, and completely intense.  Certainly, a must have in any rock lover's collection.  This band is where \\"Pure Rock and Roll\\" peaked.  Rythmic, melodic, poetic, power.
B000059WOD|5.0|Linkin Park is a Rock/Rap style band, I do not like rap very much but this is an exception!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>My favorite song on the cd is: In The End, and I think you would like it too<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Sorry for such a short review but thats all there is to say<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I dont think you would be disappointed <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I hope you have enjoyed my review and I hope I haven't waisted your time so GOOD BYE :)
B000000W5N|5.0|I like the Stones, but am sometimes ambivalent toward them.  On their albums, I often find things I don't like or could take or leave--country, disco, overraunchiness, or just plain so-so quality.  Then repetitiveness--reference the so-revered Exile on Main Street.  But with Sticky Fingers, man, the Stones did it.  Their finest studio album, it contains their two best long cuts ever, among the greatest ever in rock.  &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; is perhaps the Stones' best rocker of all, and is anything else a more quintessential Stones song?  (No to &quot;Satisfaction&quot;--lyrics only there.)  It has the catchiest and neatest rhythm and beat of all their rocking songs, as well as cryptically dirty lyrics, and Bobby Keys' very cool sax embellishes it perfectly.  Keys also shines in &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking,&quot; in which an offbeat rock, sort of funky, opening with fuzz-boxy lead guitar metamorphoses into...jazz.  No, not jazz rock, just jazz, but it is great, one of the group's most creative moments.  You feel like you are in a soundroom, isolated, captivated by the compelling mood created by Keys, Charlie Watts' terrific drumming, and Mick Taylor's slick leads that evolve into hypnotic lines.<br />The other two superb songs are &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses.&quot;   The former is one of the Stones' two absolutely most lovely compositions, along with &quot;As Tears Go By.&quot;  Whereas &quot;Tears&quot; might be more purely evocative with its straightforward strings and precious verseline, the gorgeous &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; is much more lush, bringing in layered strings instead, along with beautiful piano by Jim Price.  In fact, the opening and later guitar plucks sound more like harp on this dreamy, shimmering, exquisitly textured song, as Mick sings &quot;I'm hiding sister and I'm dreaming, I'm riding down your moonlight mile.&quot;  &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is country, slow but with beautiful cadences.  Extremely evocative, it features fabulous singing by Mick accompanied by pretty melodic guitar lines.<br />Other good songs are included. &quot;Sway,&quot; rough-edged, moderate tempo, has a great closing guitar solo by Mick Taylor.  &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is about what you think, carried by acoustic guitar, soft and pensive, and &quot;I Got The Blues&quot; is also slow, at once dreary and soulful, punctuated by horns and keyboards.  &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; is another countryesque number.  Indeed, there is something less of a rock and roll feel to &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; the only rocker besides the opener being &quot;Bitch,&quot; not a standout.  But the quality is top notch.  The Stones are never better than on Sticky Fingers.
B00000JGEI|5.0|The action is non stop the music is great as well as the special effects.Also beautiful actress,Linda Hamilton will make many feminists happy because she does an awesome job as the tough,intelligent Sandra Conner.Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in the first one and is even better as the Terminator turned good.
630562285X|4.0|This movie, was very unpredictable. That's what I mostly enjoyed about it! The acting was great. Two great actors(Sean Connery and Cathrine Zeta-Jones) did a great job in this movie. There like good guy-bad guys! There bad guys that you like. The action is great, the plot line is good! I still haven't told you much about the movie either than it's good! Well, their both stealers, who steal a bunch of stuff. The last is 8 billion dollars, at a world's largest bank. That was the best part of the movie. Alot of one line humours type of thing! I consider this to be one of my all time favourite movies, two thumbs up!!!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Ok, I'll skip the part where I'm supposed to talk about rock-and-roll-saviours and Velvet Underground-alikes. ...<br />Despite the fact that I don't like their first single off the critically acclaimed \\"Is This It?\\" album, I have to admit this is a fine rock-and-roll-doggie piece. No, there's nothing new here. But the spicy guitar on \\"The Modern Age\\" and funny bass line on the title song are worth the price! There's no \\"New York City Cops\\" in the american version of the record (which I think is very sad since this is one of the highlights - thank God my CD has) but it won't be hard to find it anywhere else over the Net.<br />Overall, I'd say that of course this ain't no Beatles - but it ain't bad at all. Julian Casablancas is a talented singer and the band just rocks out loud. Recommended for those about to rock.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Okay, at parts it was silly, but either than that, it was great. John Travolta is the bad guy. A very likeable bad guy though! Than, Halle Berry was a good guy pretending to be a bad guy, but she really wasn't. Hugh Jackman and Travolta are both hackers and a cop(Don Cheadle) is chasing after them! All Stanley(Jackman) really wants is to see his daughter. Travolta will make that deal for 10 million dollars. So, their like buddies throughtout the movie. Enjoyable! Not Travolta's best, but it's darn good! Travolta's character is played a happy bad guy! This was unique. Nothing like other movies. See this movie!!
B00005ARDC|4.0|After listening over and over to \\"Is This It?\\" from you-know-who, I decided to give a shot to this also new band - and surprisingly, they rock! \\"Whatever Happened...\\" is a damn great tune and is worthy the whole album. But don't stop reading - there's plenty from where this came. \\"Love Burns\\" is another singalong and must be exciting live, as is \\"Rifles\\" and \\"As Sure As The Sun\\" (great bass on this one).<br />My favourite track is \\"Red Eyes And Tears\\", which sounds like an angry and hopeless love song. I think this is a great debut and sure does put this band on the map. Definitely worth checking out and keeping an eye on these folks.
B00005OAIE|5.0|...While John Mayer is a guy with a guitar, his lyrics and catchy melodies ring much truer to this 30-something than ...[other bands]. Check out the opening line from the soon-to-be-a-hit \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\": We got the afternoon, you got this room for two, one thing i've left to do, discover me, discovering you.\\"<br />Or the second verse of  \\"No Such Thing\\", which is... getting airplay on MTV: So the good boys and girls take the so called right track, faded white hats, grabbing credits,<BR>maybe transfers. They read all the books but they can't find the answers. And all of our parents, they're getting older,<BR>I wonder if they've wished for anything better, while in their memories,tiny tragedies....They love to tell you stay inside the lines. But something's better, on the other side.<br />Bittersweet and oh so on the mark.

ANYONE. if you havent read this, i seriously recommend it. it most certainly will not disappoint you.
B0000636UN|5.0|This CD is being released at a perfect time....spring/summer. Most of the tunes are &quot;light&quot; and &quot;fun.&quot;  Almost every song has a star guest Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines, etc. But, none seem obtrusive or pushed.  Sheryl maintains her now classic and recognizeable vocals.  If you like her previous work (Tuesday Night Music Club in particular)  you should like this.  If you are looking for something grounbreaking, it is not here.
B00005R87Q|4.0|I'm a Vin Diesel and a huge import car fan. In my opinion, the acting in this movie was well below average.  The cars were beautiful though. I loved this movie and a lot of my car enthusiast friends stayed in the theatre after it was over to see it again. If you just want a fun movie and love cars, this one is for you.

You just wanna hug her!<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age because it makes you laugh and puts you in a good mood. Monsters ROCK!

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow has had successes with Tuesday Night Music Club, her self-titled record, Sheryl Crow, and The Globe Sessions, but this time it is even better. Sheryl crow collaborates with such names as Lenny Kravitz and Don Henley. The new record has a great beat and feel. Full of energy and talent. This is a review not to miss!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I liked very much this movie and I have purchased it, but it is not what I was expecting. I was expecting a little more from this movie, but this should be a very enjoyable and interesting movie to watch and I recommend buying it.
B000002J23|4.0|After Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left Yes in the late 70s, Squire, Howe, and White wrote and recorded some of the most direct rock music of their careers at that point with _Drama_.  By adding Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (The Buggles) to the mix, this new version of Yes made an immacuately produced album that has proven to divide many Yes fans.<br />If you can't accept a Yes without Anderson on vocals, then you might have problems with this album.  However, it's remarkable of how lively and powerful _Drama_ is considering it was made just a couple of years after the very 70s sounding, and often anemic-sounding _Tormato_.  Howe and Squire have hinted that they started to become a little uninterested in Anderson's twee lyrics towards the end of the 70s, and right off the bat _Drama_ kicks in with a metallic riff that would've surely put off Anderson.  &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; is a powerful song that showcases each of the individual members' chops.  &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; are two new wavey/punk experiments fueled by Squire's thumping bass lines.  The album really belongs to Squire as his bass work usually proves to be the most interesting thing on about 3/4 of the album.  Howe is also in full &quot;rock&quot; mode with unusually heavy riffs and leads considering the more &quot;classical&quot; and refined nature of _Going for the One_ and _Tormato_. <br />This is a very solid album.  It would probably appeal to those who prefer Yes' work with Rabin than with Howe.  I think this is an interesting album because it highlights one of the only times that Squire and Howe seemed to be in charge of Yes - and possibly the last time they even got along with one another as recent tours seem to indicate that there is a definite distance between them (atleast on stage).
B00005JKED|4.0|I didn't though that Training Day was going to be this good. This movie has lots of action to keep you on your seat pretty entertained during the whole movie.
B00005KARJ|4.0|This is not the best Disney film, I think but it's very cute, and the Dumbo is an endearing character.
B00004X0ER|4.0|while they're obviously influenced by the stooges/MC5 like eveyone else is saying (and probably the dead boys, too) they're generally faster than any of those bands. what they realy sound EXACTLY like is the first few New Bomb Turks albums (who were also just old school punk rip off artists who are still pretty great). and therefore anyone who loves this album should get Pissing Out The Poison and/or Destroy Oh Boy for more of the same, maybe a little bit better (either of the Motards albums as well).

B0000636UN|5.0|C'mon, C'mon is a luscious audio-invitation to Crow's most introspective interpretation of her beliefs and attitude in the 70s acoustic soundvibes. The pop-rock chick who gave us the breezy \\"Everyday is a winding road\\" and the infectious \\"My favorite mistake\\" has clearly mellowed her commercial side after a 3-year recording and self-production to allow for more creativity and reflective poetry in her lyrics. Just listen to her haunting collaboration with Emmylou Harris \\"Weather Channel\\" to witness Crow's mastery in translating her pain and insecurities in its most elemental. \\" There's a black dog/ That scratches my door/ He's been growling my name saying/ You better get to running\\". It is easily her best effort in years and worth the price of the album for the song alone. The naked vulnerability of Crow continues to overwhelm the album with ravaging poignancy through songs that speak of infatuation and love decay. The collaboration with Gwyneth Paltrow \\"It's only love\\" flashes out ironies of love \\"You were master of so many/ Savior to none\\" and her other song \\"Over you\\" marks her obsession with an ex - \\"Well we had a good time/ But you didn't really want me until I was gone/\\". Rest assured that Sheryl Crow occasionally rocks too. The first single \\"Soak up the sun\\" grows on you with the delicious hook and \\"Steve McQueen\\" opens the album triumphantly in all 70s Western splendor and energy. Her ... attitude seeps through her naughty lyrics \\"I'm all American rebel/ Making my big getaway\\" while her mordant satire on pop-stars nowadays amuses - \\"Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more\\" in her segue \\"You're an original\\" with Lenny Kravitz. \\"Safe and Sound\\" offers one of the most melancholic epilogues with its stark desperation in a chant-like realm.<br />Though her songs lack the tongue-in-cheek hooks like Alanis, her lyrics brilliantly escapes awkward syntax committed by the latter. Her acoustic guitar rock does not stick out like P, J Harvey and this album is anemotional roller-coaster with its raw lyrical edge. C'mon C'mon offers some stellar guest vocals including Don Henley in the country ballad \\"It's so easy\\" and Liz Plair et al. It is a rewarding and fruitful effort by Crow to astute listeners- an album that mirrors the ugliness in stardom and opens the wounds of her life in an honest and ultimately devastating portrait of grief and loss. Highly recommended.
B00005RY7X|1.0|I am losing my faith in society. \\"Party 'Til You Puke.\\" \\"Party Hard.\\" \\"It's Time to Party.\\" Has the whole [darn] world gone insane? This is the guy who is being praised as everything from the second coming of the Rolling Stones to Weezer and Pearl Jam? <br />Granted, most mainstream modern rock is terrible (Creed, 3 Doors Down, etc etc etc) but that doesn't mean everyone should be comparing to Nirvana the first schmuck that comes along and plays Danzig with a synthesizer in background; this is NOT original, and it's not even that good. And the lyrics... don't get me started. \\"I love New York City/Oh yeah, New York City.\\" It makes Mandy Moore sound like Bob Dylan.<br />Don't pretend this is a revolution in music because everything else is bland. The truth is, his songs are just as boring, bubble-gum rock-rop as Third Eye Blind or anything else today, except they're about partying instead of romance. That's fine. I can certainly live with other people's tastes, as utterly terrible as they may be. But don't dirty the name of rock legends -- don't taint MY music -- by comparing them to this [garbage].
B00005QGAX|5.0|Although lacking a killer single(according to most but not me) Bad is by far Michael's best work. Every song on the album is fantastic, which is a rarity. The #1 songs on the album are everything you could ask for, but what makes the disc so great are the &quot;filler&quot; songs that are anything but. Michael's crowning achievement on Bad(and his career) would have to be Smooth Criminal. no one does percussion better than Michael and the instrumental layering on this song is pure genius. Not only that but the new songs are simply superb. Having that said it's one of the greatest albums of all time, despite the demo like recording and MIDI like sounds of the songs, which are the only gripes I have on this masterpiece.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I think that this cd by Nickelback is one of the best out there. It's hard to find a cd now that you can actually listen through all the songs and not have to skip one or two, but this cd is definetly not like that. Each song is personal for the band members and that's what makes this cd such a great one. I listen to it all the time and I don't own any other cd that can compare to it.

Not only did it drag for 3+ hours and that song....I mean come on its okay to hear the thing maybe once or twice a day but every five minutes? I was FORCED to see it by a friend and I have to say that the only good thing about the whole experience was that I got to take a 2 hour nap....then i woke up by the noise of the boat sinking and the idiot behind my seat sobbing because Jack was dying or whatever...I mean I was sitting there for 3+ hours waiting for the ... boat to sink so I can go home and sleep.....And for the record I was 16 at the time and I still thought it [was bad]!!!
0553208845|3.0|There exists a space in which we find ourselves in deep contemplation over life and our destiny. It is at those moments when a book like Siddhartha can be meaningful without being invasive. The journey of a Brahmin's son and his childhood friend asks more questions than it answers.<br /><br />What is the meaning to our existence and how do we find true joy? Siddhartha is outwardly content, yet in his heart there is no joy. This is not a matter of simply struggling over a current confusion, this is an internal struggle which seeks to destroy his very being, eating at his very life energy, consuming his waking hours. He is a seeker, insatiable, desiring his own sense of Nirvana.<br /><br />At first he seeks to become a Samana and deny himself all worldly possessions and pleasures. \\"Siddhartha had one single goal-to become empty, to become empty of thirst, desire, dreams, pleasure and sorrow-to let the Self die.\\"<br /><br />After living a life in which he denies himself all pleasure, he longs for a life filled with pleasure and is satiated to the point of feeling sickened by lust and greed. Finally he finds his way to a river. The most beautiful section of this book is when Siddhartha listens to what the river is telling him.<br /><br />\\"Have you learned from that secret from the river, that there is no such thing as time?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes...That the river is everywhere at the same time, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the current, in the ocean and in the mountains, everywhere, and that the present only exists for it, not the shadow of the past, nor the shadow of the future.\\"<br /><br />Siddhartha almost gives his life to the water in his despair. However, the river becomes a source of inner reflection for him when he realizes his awakening is his path to wisdom. Even as I finished the story I wondered if Siddhartha had found the inner peace, or if he had just made a pact with his soul not to contemplate the mystery of the universe any further.<br /><br />Even in the most difficult situations when God feels far away, He might just be letting us awaken to our own inner world. Waiting, loving us, waiting. Perhaps waiting for us to make the right decisions in life, to find our destiny. To find Him.<br /><br />If you enjoy Siddhartha, you will love Of Marriageable Age by Sharon Maas.

B00005ABX0|5.0|Smiley-Smile is an album with GREAT songs, great arrangement, really good lyrics, GREAT melodies, and overall a feeling that can't be beat.  Next to Smiley, every other psychedelic album I know is juvenile nonsense.  Only Smiley is a genuinely enjoyable and fascinating album.<br />Wild Honey is probably equally great.  Sure, it's &quot;back to basics&quot; R&amp;B - except not really.  While the Beatles were getting going on the uneven and often silly White Album, the Beach Boys were putting out this gem, complete with brilliant, memorable, intriguing lyrics, incredibly fresh and lively piano parts, some of Carl Wilson's best ever vocals, and one of the freakiest songs ever (Here Comes the Night).  Buy this and you will not regret it.  No, really.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I didnt buy it or anything but i just want to say that this is such a fun movie.  I did the musical for my school play (I was the plant) and it's soewhat different (especially the ending) but this movie is pretty true to the play it's based on.  It's so original and funny and had great music.  A MUST HAVE for anyone who appreciats musical theatre!  And the black and white version [is bad] by the way because there's no music and it's very monotonous and dry.
6300215512|5.0|Not much is left to be said about this unique masterpiece that dared to portray the tragic, shadowy side of the Hollywood rat race.  Not only is it a fascinating, almost hypnotic experience as a drama but, in addition......Gloria Swanson was essentially playing HER REAL-LIFE SELF!  That's more or less the way she existed in 1950.....<br />Then consider that Erich von Stroheim had actually been her real-life director and lover during their heyday....and you have another creepy by morbidly fascinating dimension to the film.<br />And you know how corny William Holden's narration sounds? In a minor way, it detracts from the film BUT, as one astute writer pointed out, that's because Joe Gillis IS a HACK writer..not a genuinely talented one, and that's the way he would think and talk.<br />And then there is Franz Waxman's exotic and decadent \\"Salome\\" music, everytime Norma starts to drift into her past...most noticeably in the amazing final scene.<br />But why write or read about it??? GET IT AND WATCH IT, OVER AND OVER!  And where the heck is the DVD?  I hope that dufus Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't have the rights to the film tied up with that extravagant ego-trip of a musical.
B00005JKJA|5.0|*CONTAINS NO SPOILERS*<br />I can not begin to explain how confused I was when I saw this movie, but after reading the reviews on amazon it is like suddenly everything came back flooding my memory and I cannot believe I didn't get it before.  We meet Betty, an aspiring actress from Ontario on her way to Hollywood to make it big, Rita comes into play after a car accident from which she results in slight amnesia.  Rita takes shelter with Betty and they soon become lovers/friends and set out to find why Rita was going to Mulholland Dr.  Well this movie has more twists than the Mississippi River I will tell you that- I am now aware it was all a dream and Betty's truly happy existence is not what we make it out to be.  While in a diner Rita see's that the waitress's name tag reads DIANE which all of the sudden make her mind click and say DIANE SYLVIN, what we learn later is truly shocking to the identity of Diane.  I am still unclear of what the blue box represented, and also what the two older people had anything to do with the movie (by older people I am referring to the woman and man on the flight from Ontario)...
0767803434|4.0|After making a speech to the world about a no-tolerence policy againgst terrorism, the president's plane is hijacked by terrorists.  This is an amazing film.  The plot is superb, and the action is great.  Harrison Ford is an astounding actor, and plays a president/father with super accuracy.  The stunts in this movie are great, including a scene with a refueling tanker, and a scene where the president must ride a tether to get out of the plane.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This was a great movie!  Russell Crowe made Maximus totally believable and this film gives you an insight into Roman history.  Except for a couple of things, it is true to the historical happenings.  It brings the animalistic side of humanity to the forefront while balancing it with the spiritual side of the main character.  Well written, well acted, and not a trace of sex or 4 letter words, even the battle scenes are done as tastefully as possible.  I was on the edge of my seat during the battle scenes, cringing at the actions of Commodus and cheering for Maximus when he proves what it is to really be a man.
630179513X|3.0|Third time may be a charm, but not with this film series.  While this movie is good, the other two are far better than this.  Anyway, after Doc is sent to the Old West, Marty goes back to rescue him.  Along the way, Doc gets a girlfriend, and Marty gets in trouble with Biff's anscestor, the local ruffian.  The train seen at the end is cool, though.<BR>The acting is still good, but the jokes are worn out by now.  This movie is definitly not terrible, it is good, just not as good as the other two.  If you liked the first two, see this one too.
B0000636UN|1.0|She was a headliner in the beginning of her career, but lately she hasn't been up to the standards that she showcased with her first material.  Over time her work became less and less noticed and her albums began to flop. In an attempt to regain control of her spiraling fame, she began to market her videos and songs to a younger audience, by appearing on MTV &amp; VH1 in exotic areas for music videos and wearing next to nothing at award shows. However that may help her gain a fan basis, but it doesn't make the actual music any better, and like the previous ones before it, Crow's newest material continues to disappoint.<br />The album's first single \\"Soak up the Sun\\" is one of those tracks that you have to be in the mood to listen to. Its an OK track, but it doesn't flow through well. \\"Steve McQueen\\", \\"You're an Original\\", \\"Safe and Sound\\" and the title track are all atrocious and easily Crow's worst material to date. However on a brighter side, the album isn't a complete waste. The more trl-ready songs like \\"Diamond Road\\" &amp; \\"Its So Easy\\" are high points on the album, and through the failure, are the two sure fire picks as favorites and hopefully the next two singles. The album's attempts at ballads, \\"Its Only Love\\" &amp; \\"Abilene\\" aren't the worst thing on here, but they aren't good either. I felt like crying when I listened to \\"Hole in my Pocket\\", because if this is what artists can pass off as music today, then I guess that I will have to keep on some old school material.<br />Overall, Crow put in one of the worst if not the worst albums of her long spanning career. Only loyal fans will purchase the album, and she won't gain any new loyal ones. Basically it comes down to who has the most loyal fans in the long run, because the artists that do make a great deal of money and can get a certified platinum or gold plaque. Crow however continues to lose these fans, and that is why her albums continue to lose sales.
0064409422|5.0|If you liked King Fortis the Brave or the Harry Potter books, you will love The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  Rich in imagination, it details a quest, not unlike the one in King Fortis, to restore order to a magical kingdom that is both different and at the same time reflective of our own.  You will not be able to read this book without picking up the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is an amazing, beautiful album. I don't know why this band isn't very famous, because it's not easy to some up with songs like this. Though On Avery Island is great, this is slower, more melancholy and intersting and far superior. One of the best albums I've ever listened to, honestly. The title track is particularly amazing. Buy it at your local record store, it's indy rock after all!
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch is his own man and he is unafraid to put out films that are untouched reruns of his own wild imagination.  MULHOLLAND DRIVE  drives some people crazy because of their need for absolute resolution of stories.  This little gem of a film is more like a carefully staged stream of consciousness and if you can't jump on the ride then you're missing the joy.  Lynch has captured fine performances from a strong cast, explores terrain rich and strange, and even goes over the edge just enough to test our thinking and conceptual skills.  The ending is up to the viewer.......and what a refreshing turn for a film to take!  Give in to it.  The DVD allows you to see it at home where you don't need to fret that people around you may think you confused.
B000002U9L|5.0|This has to be my favorite movie soundtrack, hands down. I just recently purchased Labyrinth on DVD and I've watched it multiple times already. My favorites are As the World Falls Down, and Within You (which is too short!) AND, congrats to Jennifer Connelly on getting the Best Supporting Actress Award!
B0000636UN|4.0|The first thing that struck me was the \\"style\\" of songs...Sheryl produced this on her own, but had I not known that I could swear that Brian Eno, Danil Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite were behind this....I bought the album yesterday and at first listen, which was on my walkman commuting home, I was not blown away...When I got home and actually listened to it, I fell in love with it. <br />The one thing am not sure about is the multi vocal tracks on many of the songs, their mixed well, but perhaps a little overdone......She also relies heavily on quck tempo changes with vocal samples sandwiched between the chord changes..perhaps this will just take some getting used too.<br />Overall this is a wonderful album that will only get better when am able to digest the complexity of it. Diamond Road, Abilene, and Luck Kid are my favorite tracks.....Don Henley's guest appearance is a godsend.<br />You will hear a jambalya of bluegrass, neil young like guitars, and good ole fashion blues on this record....Its easy to tell that Sheryl is quite proud of her homestate of Missouri....
0316743003|5.0|I just love books like this.  I think it stems from the fact that I always wanted to be a jet pilot.  The book takes a look at the secret domain of the black projects the military has funded in relation to intelligence gathering and stealth aircraft over the past 35 years.  The books focus is on the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works facility and the great aircraft they have developed and put out during the cold war.  The most interesting parts of he book for me were the development of the SR 71, the testing of the aircraft and the uniqueness of the aircraft.  I also enjoyed the descriptions of what the U2 can do.   <br />All in all this is a very informative and well-written account of some of the most exciting aircraft the U.S. has created and used in military operations.   The details flow very well and do not bog the book down with too much technical speak.  If you were interested in aircraft or the U.S. military then I would suggest you buy this book.

JACKDAWS is a must read.

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow did not disappoint in her first new release since The Globe Sessions in 1998.  This record doesn't have the raw sound of the eponymous album, but it's a beautifully crafted album ranging from the pop sounds of Soak Up The Sun to the raw emotion of Weather Channel and the rock sounds of You're An Original.  It is very well-rounded; there isn't too much of any one sound, but it's all tied together very well.  A must for any Crow fan, or simply for anyone who enjoys great music!
B00004U2HK|5.0|Everything about this movie is majestic, the scenery, the music, the voices, the actors. They all fit perfectly together to produce the most beautiful sound on film the world ever heard. Time will never detract from its magic which will always remain enchanting the young and young at heart, charming its way into their souls. In &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Julie Andrews is the quintessential romantic heroine, sweet and vulnerable and completely innocent. Christopher Plummer assumed the role of the handsome captain convincingly and all the women in the world fell in love with him. The children are adorable and their portrayals all realistic, with a freshness that remains pertinent even many years later. What a great Reverend Mother too! I can go on, but you get the picture (get it!) and you'll see what I mean! This is a &quot;10 stars&quot; film, 5 are not enough!
B00005OB0A|4.0|Kylie Minogue has had much success with her latest album FEVER. The first single &quot;Cant Get You Out Of My Head&quot; has been a huge hit worldwide, most significantly in the US where she has not had a hit for quite a wile. FEVER comes after her excellent album LIGHT YEARS. FEVER is a very uptempo dance album, with lots of great loops and hooks, and upbeat dance all around. The album opens with the upbeat &quot;More More More&quot;. Next is one of my favorite tracks on the disc, &quot;Love At First Sight&quot;, which in my opinion is an instant Kylie classic with its electronica beat and catchy lyrics. The title track &quot;Fever&quot; however takes my pick for the best song on the set, with a catchy melody and addictive chorus, with great lyrics to boot. &quot;Give It To Me&quot; is another addictive dance song which will keep you singing along and dancing. Other highlights on the disc include the catchy &quot;Burning Up&quot;, the beautiful &quot;Fragile&quot; and the current single &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. Overall FEVER is definately a piece of pop/dance fluff, its nowhere near as good as her overlooked IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS, but its a fun album to listen to and definately worth having!
B00005OWEG|4.0|Nearly 3 and Half hours! The new scene with the Playboy Bunnies was, well, worth a second look, and there is no doubt that Cupolla erred when he cut the act with the French Plantation owner, it lent so much to the overall understanding of the time, however all in all when the credits roll I don't think you have gained much over the original.  Still, if you are fortunate enough to have never seen the original this is the version to see.  Just plan on a couple of intermissions.
6305013578|5.0|A must have for history of cinema. Very affordable price for my collection. One of the best si-fi of it's time with socialist point of view. An unnti-emperialist capitalist film.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I am dumbfounded to read so many reviews mentioning 'dumb blonde' when describing Elle Woods, Miss Witherspoon's character.  I watched the movie and there's nothing dumb about Elle Woods.  To me, she's brought up with confidence in herself.  Don't know who embedded this strong belief in one's self in Elle Woods.  But it's there, so evidently portrayed by Miss Witherspoon.  She's not a bit self-conscious showing up with her own west coast fashion sense in the east coast Harvard Law campus and she's not a bit ashamed of who she is.  Although her failed relationship had temporarily set her back and the people she encountered in Harvard Law had tried to put her down and belittle her (they almost succeeded), her healthy dose of self-esteem came to her rescue every time.<br />It's a far-fetched comedy by all means but Miss Witherspoon always came prepared for her roles with a great deal of understanding into their psyche, motivation, and character development.  It's her grounded portrayal of Elle Woods that made this movie a fun movie watching experience.<br />This blonde is no dumb blonde.  She knows who she is and is not intimidated by the world full of jealousy and judgment.  All of us should feel this strongly in ourselves because after all we are quite unique and beautiful in our own right.
B000000W5L|5.0|A CD with outstanding original rock. The album includes quality tracks and gives listeners what they pretty much want, not that any fan can always get what he/she wants. Anyway, with no filler cuts but only an honest representation of how The Bad Boys of Rock again turned their recording drive into a session appreciated by all. These megarockers confirmed that popular music isn't necessarily something evidenced by Top40 table-tunes. Tumbling Dice and Happy are great tracks but the other tracks also ultimately gave this album its deserving rank amongst other of their mileStones. Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, Sweet Virginia, Torn And Frayed, Loving Cup and All Down The Line in particular distinctly became rock favorites that when played gave(gives) listeners the relief needed to escape temporarily the hazards of everyday living. The blended southern attributes complimented most of the tracks adding character and dimension to unfixed southern R`nB appeal/influence. Keith Richards well put his words into music with impressive guitar riffs on the final track Soul Survivor. Although drugs were to become a group burden soon after the album's release, Mick Jagger and remaining band members luckily obliged themselves enough to keep their music esteem(s) their long-term priority. Because its date, the mosaic on the front cover also provided a good spoof to the `Rock `N Roll does a great job complimenting this era of innocence and integrity` theme...
B00000JBFW|4.0|I was 17 and still at school at the time when Deep Purple reformed in 1984... After I'd breathlessly listened to the album for the first time I was left with a sense of emptiness... in short, I felt disappointment.<br />But how could this reunion album have been any different? The musical landscape in the mid '80s had evolved unrecognisably since Purple's heyday during the raw, uninhibited early '70s.<br />Where self expression and free improvision had once ruled now the culture was compressed, minimalist and reigned in. In hindsight how on earth Purple managed to release an album such as Perfect Strangers, which somehow managed to merge the two disparate musical cultures together, is a testament to their abilities as songwriters, musicians and performers.<br />Let no-one tell you any different... Deep Purple are true masters and innovators of the hard rock genre.  I wasn't able to appreciate \\"Perfect Strangers\\" fully at the time but hindsight has made me appreciate what an amazing juggling act this band managed to pull off in 1984.<br />Few parellels can be drawn from the band's end in 1976 to the release of this album. It is as if everything in those intervening years had been reinvented. \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is like the beginning of a new band, whose ghosts had been together once before in a previous life... a sentiment echoed perfectly by the lyrics of the title track. Listen and appreciate what an achievement this album was. Zeppelin never had the guts to reform and try it, Purple did... and more power to 'em.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is the true story of a professor who grew suffering from a horrible mental illness known as paranoid-schizophrenia. The movie comes from the professor's perspective in the first person and you see first hand what a paranoid-schizophrenic individual experiences on a daily basis.<br />Having spent more than a decade as a former psychologist specializing in the mental health sector, I have often imagined what it would be like to be inside the mind of one of my many clients who suffered from this horrible mental illness. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" portrays what I envisioned. It's hard for most of us who have never had a psychosis to understand what is wrong with individuals like this. If you want a dose of experience, view this flick! Keep in mind that this professor (portrayed by Crowe) is considered a higher functioning paranoid-schizophrenic because his intelligence is outstanding. What many do not understand is that in most cases, it takes a very creative and intelligent mind to become schizophrenic.<br />Now, the movie does a beautiful job of portraying the life of this professor, but from my understanding, there were various liberties taken in the film. That's too bad, but I'm not judging the movie based upon its authenticity as much as I am with the final outcome of just the movie itself. So, I'll not base my ratings on that aspect.<br />What stops me from giving a full five stars is the acting job Crowe does. Don't get me wrong, he did most everything right that I can think of. However, he plays a southern gentleman (West Virginian if I am correct) and his accent suffers. Since he is Australian, I think he did quite an admirable job at trying to sound southern, but it detracted from the movie a bit too much as if it were forced. I might have gotten a different actor for the part to make it more authentic, but of course, Crowe is big time right now so I understand their decision.<br />Regardless, get the DVD. You'll love it and it'll forever be a popular part of your collection!
014028009X|1.0|As a 'Singleton' who wants to lose weight, I feel Helen Fielding has taken this issue too far - and instead of making Bridget funny, Ms. Feilding made her and her silly friends... Not only didn't I identify with Bridget and the situations she put herself in, but I also didn't find her & those situations funny / educating, etc.<br />This is yet another one of those 'Single British around 30 Single Girl' stories that seem to flood us lately. This seems to be the most popular one, but I personally feel it's the worst of the bunch I've read (it certainly is the most un - original and least funny of them). I reccomend 'Confessions of a Shopaholic' to anyone who's interested in a better book - not only is Rebbeca Bloomwood a more believable character (even though all of these girls are a little over the top), but it certainly much funnier tha... little Bridget can ever hope to be.
6302968100|5.0|What happens when you learn how to be a man from the big screen? Clarence Worley is about to find out since his old man was rarely around. When he needs to think, he goes into the bathroom. Guess who visits him there--- ELVIS! Who else? While not considered Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece, this film is important as we think about boys' initiation into manhood. What are we teaching? What is he learning? The cast is stellar. Patricia Arquette gets one of the gutsiest fight scenes I've ever seen. The dangerously handsome James Gandolfini appears as do a hyped-up Michael Rappaport and a couch potatoed Brad Pitt. Now that I think about it, everyone is in this film (Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Gary Oldman, Balki- can't remember his real name- Bartakamous, Daphne's fiancee from \\"Frasier\\"). A film that is important and didn't get the respect it deserved. (Very violent & Frequent use of the F- word.)
B0000042H4|4.0|These recordings were among the first I ever obtained as a young man, and they had a dramatic effect on my musical tastes and preferences in subsequent years. Unfortunately, they were the vinyl records, and I haven't played them in years. Only days ago, I ordered the complete set, and can't wait to get it. Nilsson's Brunnhilde has NEVER been surpassed, in my opinion. She has become, for me, like Callas for many others....a veritable Goddess!  Beyond her perfect contribution to the recording, there is the very strong cast, even in minor roles that make this set special.  I have heard the criticism of Solti, and the 'sonic' manipulations that were injected into this set.  As far as the former is concerned, I simply don't agree.  Solti, to my way of thinking, provides a near-perfect interpretation, and the Vienna Philharmonic are nothing short of superb!

B00004XQ83|5.0|This album is a wonderful collection by a great variety of artists whose love for their music and tradition is obvious in how well they do it. <br />Now, if you are looking for the perfect accompaniment to this, check out another 5 star CD that I just remastered that takes you to the well that this music sprang from: Will the Circle <BR>Be Unbroken. <br />It is wonderful that Oh, Brother has brought such new attention to acoustic music; especially nice of them to time it with the 30th anniversary of the Circle album! I would stake my career on any buyer of Brother liking Circle. Go checkout the reviews there, and you will see what I mean. <br />If you do not have Brother, you should get one.. then get the Circle... you should have both! Why not? It's all great award winning music.
B000002UAX|3.0|I find it hard to appreciate this album, and I am surprised by the amount of positive reviews it gets. The songs on this set often bypass any discernable melody and are often quite raw and abrasive. There are some good ones though (thankfully!)<BR>Stand out tracks include: Back in the USSR, Blackbird, I Will, Julia, Mother Natures Son, Revolution 1, Helter Skelter,<BR>but some of the material is so banal, it sounds like the pop music of today. I'm thinking of Wild Honey Pie as a case in point
B00004Z459|1.0|I bought this album on a whim. I had some birthday money, so I went out and beefed up my record collection. I sold this to my used CD outlet pretty quick. This is Nu-Metal, that lesser form of rock that is based on teen angst and family troubles. Many of the problems with this album are inherent to the genre, so I won't look too deep into that. Just know that there IS good music out there that doesn't rely on whining about every single person that ever bumped into them in the hallway at school. Rap-rock, the lesser form of nu-metal is hard to make good. The closest incarnation of rap-rock to be truly great is The Deftones \\"Adrenaline\\" but even that is stretching the definition. But enough of that..., we've all heard it a million times, onto what's wrong with Lincoln Park (sic). First of all, they are clearly without talent (but I'm a large proponent of the fact that just cause music is easy to play doesn't mean it's bad). The problem with these guys is that it's laughably bad. For example- \\"In the End\\" the guitar amounts to strum this chord, hold it, strum the next chord hold it... repeat. Also for rap and rock to properly be fused it shouldn't just be a rapper over guitars, the style should change, this doesn't happen here. The singer is nasal to the point of annoyance. The main factor that makes Lincoln Park (sic) so bad? They're boring. I can look past the whining, the poor musicianship, etc, if the music is fun to listen to. Lincoln Park (sic) aren't. I feel sorry for anyone who has ever paid to see them live... nothing like watching a guy stand there, while crying about his girlfriend using him, and being crushed against a swarm of strangers. Don't buy this album. If you want something in this vein get The Deftones, KoRn, or Tool... These bands invented nu metal and every iteration and cliche since has been copying them. Do yourself a favor, avoid this band like the plague, turn off your tv, and check out some bands like At the Drive-In, And You Will Know Us Bythe Trail of Dead, The Strokes, Dismemberment Plan, Death Cab for Cutie, and Built to Spill. I did, and that has made all the difference.

B00005KARK|2.0|this is my least favorite of all the disney movie well maybe tied with &quot;the fox and the hound&quot; and &quot;the black cauldren&quot; this has no substance and i really dont know what all the fuss is about.
B000002JS6|5.0|This is the best HARD ROCK N ROLL(not metal!) album ever made! Heavy, yet melodic at the same time,this album has stood the test-of-time and NEVER sounds dated. I'm sure you know the songs; if you don't YOU SHOULD! I can't think f aore uplifting, energetic record, EVER! ......And it is &quot;tough&quot; too!
B0000636UN|5.0|Have you ever listened to an album where you felt horrible when you skipped over a track to get to another track, feeling as though you have not done that song justice, or sort of cheated on the song?  Well that is the feeling I got listening to Sheryl Crow's latest.  In my opinion, this album is better than her sophomore self-titled album.  don't be surprised if you see this in a lot of people's top ten lists at the end of the year.  It is just a complete album.  You can tell that it took Sheryl 3 years to complete this album like it states in the cd case.  If you are caught in some type of task and want an album playing in the background that won't distract you but could get you going in your work then &quot;C'mon C'Mon&quot; might be a nice buy for you.
0876852630|5.0|I read it in like, two days. And it stays with you, too, it's the kinda book you tend to remember days later and recite bits of it like you telling your friends a joke. Some of the anecdotes here (and for thos emong you that don't like it, it's a tad heavy on the anecdotal tone, mind you) are priceless. Amusing!
0345451325|3.0|Halo: The Fall of Reach is better than you would expect from your average computer game adaptation.  The plot, though nothing special in itself, is at least well thought out.  The writing is not fantastic, but it could be much worse.  Still, an interesting read.  Some of the training of the SPARTANs is somewhat unrealistic at points, and the military discipline they exhibit tends to be overbearing; sometimes it's just plain incorrect.  If you liked the game for its story as well as its graphics and gameplay, give it a shot.  Don't expect a masterpiece.
6305776326|3.0|This is a movie that is funny the first ime you see it after that it gets really really old.
B00000099Y|2.0|Talented musicians playing unhappy music for unhappy people. I like to escape the SICK-WORLD, but TOOL & their fans embrace it. You can't deny these guys can play; I just don't enjoy the rather \\"gross-imagery\\" their fans love. I like a bit more rhythm in music too. This is their best album, and if you like TOOL(or have began to like TOOL) this is them at their peak...
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton at his best was better than anyone, even the Beatles and Sir Paul...and this is definitely one of Elton's best. Every song is great, no filler here...Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" album is mediocre compared to this. Everything meshed on this album...lyrics, band, melodies and Elton's vocals.<br />Jamaica Jerk-Off is a great song...other reviewers under appreciate it because they evidently did not know, or forgot, that the album was written in Jamaica (the album was later re-written and recorded in France where the band hand access to a real recording studio, unlike the single microphone studio they had in Jamaica) in a period of a day and a half(!), and \\"Jerk\\" is the famous Carribean spicy cuisine...Bernie Taupin was having a little play on words with the lyrics...so now you know!<br />6 stars all the way.

B00004LN16|5.0|This album is the closest thing to blues/50's rock I've heard in years.I noticed many  people who \\"trashed-it\\" are fans of bands like Winger, Cinderella, Warrant, Quiet Riot & Poison; WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?!? One \\"expert\\" gives Quiet Riot(QUIET RIOT!) 5-star reviews! AC/DC are THE KINGS OF \\"GROOVE\\"; this album (PLATINUM!) shows some people still like REAL ROCK N ROLL! AC/DC has not been this bluesy since the underrated CLASSIC \\"Powerage!\\" The title-track, \\"Meltdown,\\" \\"Hold Me Back\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"Can't Stand Still\\" are played so relaxed and with \\"raw-feeling.\\" They are the blusiest-tunes, with Angus playing some of his best blues \\"licks\\" ever. Brian Johnson(keep trashing-him, as AC/DC keeps going platinum & selling-out arenas with his \\"horrible\\" voice)   sings with feeling, and the blusiest I've ever heard him on \\"Stiff Upper Lip.\\" If you want an \\"opera-voice\\" or a  rock\\" voice,  don't listen to him! Compare him with the \\"wig-wearing\\" Kevin Dubrow from that STUPID band called.....Quiet Riot, whose albums you can find for [$$$},who WISHES he could sing as well as Johnson! Brian Johnson sings HEAVY-ROCK, and his voice IS hard rock. He gets blusier with age; a \\"Howlin' Wolf\\"(GREAT BLUES LEGEND!) type of \\"growl.\\" Enough defending of Johnson, who seems a target for bandwagon -jumpers; platinum & the title-track being #1 for over 2-months speak more LOUDLY than anything I can write! There are 2 fast-songs on \\"SUL\\": \\"Safe In New York City\\" & \\"Give It Up\\"; both show that AC/DC can still \\"skull-crush\\"... The rest of the tunes are mid-tempo. \\"Satellite Blues\\" has a vintage AC/DC \\"crunch\\" & chorus; \\"Damned\\" is a \\"bluesy-stomp\\" and a jab at political correctness; \\"Come & Get It\\" is a great \\"sleaze\\" tune, with a cool-groove and the \\"Dirty Deeds\\" \\"troll growl\\" by Malcolm Young;\\"All Screwed Up\\" is a pounding-track with a cool-break in the middle; \\"House Of Jazz\\" has a slow & ominous-beat(did I mention AC/DC has a \\"beat?!?\\"); \\"You Can't Stop Rock N Roll\\" is an angry sounding \\"chant\\" with some very WICKED  \\"string-plucking\\" by Angus, who has never abandoned HIS STYLE to appease critics; the guy can play, and if anything \\"under-plays,\\" as his goal is to \\"kick-in-your-guts\\" without \\"finger-exercises\\" up-&-down the guitar-neck! I'M GLAD THE PEOPLE THAT KNOCK THIS ALBUM HAVE THEIR OTHER REVIEWS PRINTED & YOU CAN SEE THE GARBAGE THEY LIKE! Keep listening to Winger! I think Quiet Riot may be the opening-act for some \\"frog-races\\" these days! Also glad to see some high school students into \\"SUL\\"; you guys see through the \\"B.S\\" out there & I salute you! If you like this check-out \\"Powerage\\" which has more heavy-songs & great-lyrics by THE MAN, Bon Scott! It has a bluesy-feel too...For those saying they are \\"slowed-down,\\" the next-album is being written to be heavy; and I'm sure Cinderella won't out-sell it!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok, let's just analyze the past....In 1995, Tool won a Grammy (Best Metal Performance) for perhaps the best song on their previous album (Aenima). In 2002, they won a Grammy (Best Metal Performance) for the WORST song (my opinion) on their latest album (Lateralus). [Don't get me wrong, when I say \\"Tool\\" and \\"worst song on their album\\", I am comparing only Tool songs, which are ALL musically better than anything you will find on Makeover TV.] Knowing this, you should realize that if you like dark, heavy music, you will LOVE this album. <BR>I have had Lateralus in my car since the day it was released last year, and nothing else has been in it to this day. My steering wheel has taken quite a beating!<BR>    My only suggestion (other than to buy this masterpiece) is that if you are a drummer and have not heard this album (or any other Tool album yet), you better make sure you have an extra pair of pants and underwear on hand.

B00005UW7V|5.0|I was really very moved by this movie. <br />We are transfered to an age where robots are really crucial for humans and also so much hated by the last.<BR>A new idea from a mecha(nic) creator of robots promised to give to a robot &quot;feelings&quot;, and especially love, love towards the person who innitiates its program. Love would  be the core so that the robot would communicate with the world and receive a responce as a feedback and build from this feedback a &quot;personality&quot;. Classical neural network ideas of course  way beyond our reach in the near future. So the robot will be transformed from a mecha(nic) creature to an orga(nic) creature, right.<br />The prototype was tested to a couple who had their son in hybernation for 5 years waiting for a cure to his heavy illness.<BR>All went well and the robot was happy and the couple was happy until their son recovered from his illness. Their son did not like his wired opponent and made its life miserable. Finaly the robot child did a mistake, without its fault, that could harm their sons life and the couple decided to get rid of the robotic child. Actually the person who insisted to get rid of David(The name of the robot child) was his &quot;artificial&quot; father. &quot;His&quot; artificial mother, monica who loved David very much was forced to abandon David near the place he was created. She couldn't give him to the company that created him, she knew that they would discard him.<br />After then David tries to find his &quot;Blue Fairy&quot; which will transform him to a &quot;real&quot; boy. But actually what is real. Are we real? Aren't we all creations of someone more intelligent than us?<BR>David believed that if he was human he could return to his mother and live happily with his brother.<BR>Davids wonders are amazing and Spielberg did absolutely his best to give life to Cubricks imagination. A real challenge to any director, you either succeed or fail. And I think that Spielberg succeeded! <br />Thisis one of my fovorite movies, actually it is the only movie  of its kind that realy moved me after blade runner. It is very interesting to observe how people love blade runner more as years pass by. This might be also the case with this movie.<br />I think that the end of the film was the most amazing and moving part of it. <br />I suggest you see this film, it might move you also.

B00004VW35|5.0|Neil Young has had a wildly eclectic career, I think everyone who cares knows that. And in such an experimental career there will be failures and there will be successes, but whether or not a particular recording falls into either category depends upon the listener. For me, Young doesn't get much better than &quot;Old Ways&quot;. This  straight-country genre is one that Neil had long dabbled in, so it made sense to completely immerse his muse in it. There are no rock songs here at all, just pure American country music, albeit filtered through Young's one-of-a- kind vision. So yes, he does get a  little bizarre on this album, but that's Neil, right? Songs such as 'My Boy', 'Once An Angel' and the absolutely stellar 'Where Is The Highway Tonight?' rank among the most emotional, heartfelt songs of a long career full of them. I never tired of this album and still play it often. I'd recommend &quot;Old Ways&quot; highly to pure country (not pop-country) fans as well as to Neil Young fans. It's really a great cd.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This film, though flawed, is for me ultimately a paragon of great filmmaking. It has its weak points: The editing is far too choppy; you get the feeling that you're not seeing nearly enough of Ellen Burstyn's superb performance. But it succeeds in what the real goal of film is, in powerfully communicating a message to the viewer.<br />The film is about addiction, not just to drugs, though that is the most obvious sort here, but to anything - to love and to hope. The characters make plans, they have relationships, they do their best, and they fail. The film is about their decline. It is not a happy film; it's probably the most depressing I've ever seen. But it is for that very reason that it is great. By the end you feel everything that the characters feel. It's terrible, terrible. But that is what filmmaking is about, the same as any other art: Communicating a message to the viewer. At that, the film is wonderful. I recommend it highly.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|SEE THIS MOVIE! Steel yourself first, but watch. You will laugh, cheer and cry all the way through this movie and walk away feeling as if a tornado just whipped through your soul.<br />Darren Aronofsky has done what only a young and breathtakingly original director can do creating this movie. If you have read the book (which I strongly recommend BEFORE seeing this movie) you will understand what I mean, as the book is powerful and emotionally challenging. The movie Requiem for a Dream is both visually stunning and aurally powerful. <br />Camera angels considered risky or unsettling by other mainstream directors are used with gritty confidence. Harsh sounds accompany strobe-like images in drug sequences allowing the viewer to almost FEEL what the characters feel. Aronofsky's cutting edge techniques of split screens with dual sound-tracks, long takes balanced by rapid-cut editing and staccato-like sound effects all propel the viewer on a rapid descent to hellish train wreck devastation. <br />This is not an unsympathetic film, but certainly unapologetic. Unlike other \\"drug films\\" such as Trainspotting, there is no glimmer of glamorization of drugs here. In fact, if you see this movie and ever consider trying Heroin or Speed for that matter, consider yourself beyond hope. <br />Ellen Burnstyn ... shout her name from the mountain tops! The Academy was bold enough to nominate her for an Oscar, but lost courage after that. It makes me wonder if the jury actually viewed the film. Her performance is one of the most riviting in recent memory AND was by far the most difficult role in the movie. Don't let that fool you, however; casting was done impeccably even down to a startling Marlon Wayans who turned out a dramatic role with savvy and eloquent understatement. <br />I can't say enough about Requiem for a Dream, and feel what I have said is inadequate. You won't be able to see this movie without it touching you deeply. It is slick, beautiful, ugly, and devastating. You willcarry this movie with you for a long time.
B00000JZI9|4.0|A western in the classic style with a little modern touches.  Lots of heros, people in need, and mustasche twisting villains.  Also a nice mix of talented awarding actors and some then unknown actors.  Good Hurrah movie
B000002J1F|5.0|As a longtime Yes fan, I know every record they've made to date. And I never did consider &quot;Fragile&quot; to be the best album although many do. I love it, and it is a great disc. But some of the tracks seem oddly disconnected from the  others, making the flow slightly incoherent to me. But so what. A prog snob I am not. Definitely pick this cd up, along with &quot;Relayer&quot; and &quot;Drama&quot; (my two favorites).
B0000046MM|5.0|This CD exceeded my high expectations. Highlights for me are the title track, Monasterio de Sal, Punta Umbria, La Nina de Puerta Oscura (amazing!), and El Vito, but all of the songs are good. I've definitely got to buy some more of his CD's.
B0000636UN|5.0|C'mon C'mon is an amazing compalation of songs that just want to make you get out and have some fun. This album shows Sheryl's incredible talent to play several different styles of music. From the country style &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; to the very rockin &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; Sheryl style can change with each record which keeps her fans interested. Nothing ever sounds the same. She has no fear to explore different things. This a great new album. One that you can listen to from start to finish and never get board. I recomend C'mon C'mon to everyone. It is a fun cd that nobody should be without.
B000001DZM|4.0|My only qualm with this soundtrack, which is one of my all time favorites, is the extra extended mixes of &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot;, &quot;Go West&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Groove Thing&quot;(one of my fave dance hits of all time), and &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.  These are all really fun songs that came out of the 70's, but I don't need to hear them this often! Maybe as a party disc, I can see how these mixes would fit in.  Or maybe if you are working out it would be a great collection of fast songs to get you moving, aside from the few slow ones.  I just feel that there is too much repetition.<br />The disc is outstanding aside from that.  This is such a fun group of songs to just pop in your c.d. player and groove to.  It's always gets me dancing.  It is very entertaining, and I even appreciate the older songs, &quot;I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine&quot;, and &quot;Can't Help Loving That Man&quot;, and &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;.  These are all by great female singers of an earlier generation than the 70's.<br />Being an Australian movie, they just had to throw a little ABBA in, &quot;Mamma Mia&quot;.  There are a few songs from the 90's, &quot;Save the Best for Last&quot; by Vanessa Williams and &quot;Finally&quot; by CeCe Penniston.  Then there are a few obscure 70's songs, &quot;Billy Don't be a Hero&quot;, and &quot;Take a Letter, Maria&quot;.  It is a very ecclectic mix, and the mix of songs all fit perfectly together.  It's a perfect compliment to the film itself.<br />I highly recommend this soundtrack.  This will not disappoint!  Especially for fans of the movie!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Jones still has awhile to go in terms of musical development.  A lot of her songs sound the same. However, her sultry music is relaxing and enjoyable.  I would recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys jazz or female vocalists.
0448060191|5.0|Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.<BR>   Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy.
B00005KHJV|5.0|Well. When I saw Halloween first. It was on TV. I really liked the film. Two year later I bought it on VHS and was thrilled by going to see it. But something was wrong. Some of the scenes seemed to be missing. I was really disapointed. Few months later I found out that these scenes weren't cut out but added in for tv so I understtood. But I had to find this movie but couldn't find it anywhere. I recieved this dvd for a chrismtas present and was really glad. The scenes are here but not only that this is the extended version but in the TV version a lot of cuts were made but this one does not have any cuts and include these scenes. That's why it's so great. If you don't have this buy it.
B0000084J7|4.0|I'm only halfway through this album, but already I can tell that it'll be a long time before we hear the likes of this again.<br />Unlike the busy, hyper-produced albums that pollute the charts in their misguided attempts to try to fill every single space as if silence were something to be avoided at all costs, Mark Hollis' proper solo debut embraces silence and sparseness as virtues, with results both soothing and unsettling.<br />The instrumentation is sparse throughout, often to the point of starkness. The extensive use of space within the arrangements tends to blur the distinction between songs, which seem to flow into one another, not unlike what you'd expect from a live performance.<br />Lyrically, the words to these songs appear to be chosen more for their sounds than for coherent, easily understood meaning. Underscoring this are Hollis' vocals, often fragile, and occasionally trailing off towards the end of a word or phrase.<br />As a whole, the album is suffused with a spirituality sadly lacking from most records made these days, and is often so quiet (David Sylvian is a heavy-metal god compared to this) as to be almost meditative.<br />I would go so far as to say that this album exists in a space all its own. Not a bad place to be.
B00005U122|5.0|Of the 30 or so concert DVDs I've purchased to date, this is by far the best. This DVD has a very good DD 5.1 sound track. In fact, the sound on this DVD is just awesome. The video production of the concert is also excellent with lots of close-ups of the individual players - for example, of Doyle and Snowy when they're playing their solos.  Although I have a lot of respect for David Gilmour, his writing and playing, these two guys do some excellent jamming that fits in perfectly with the particular song they're playing at the time, especially on some of the old favorites like Money, Another Brick ... and Comfortably Numb.  Roger Waters put together a first-class group of musicians for this tour and they do a great job on all the Floyd songs. If you like Pink Floyd music, this is a DVD that you'll want to put on, crank up the volume and watch from beginning to end. Every cut is a winner. The behind-the-scenes selection is a plus and I always enjoy reading the band member bios when they're available, as they are on this DVD. I couldn't find anything bad to say about this DVD. It's definitely 5 stars!
6305327084|5.0|I'm pleasantly surprised to see that this film has such good Amazon reviews. Even though it's a beautifully done, charming film, my friends insist on scoffing at me when I mention it as my favorite of ALL TIME!! My hunch is that it's a film that must be watched for it's subtleties. <br />In print, the plot is average. It's the tale of some average guys (and a couple of beautiful girls) who get together in a small New England town to attend their ten year high school reunion. Of course this would be completely drab if not for the loveable characters and unbelievable chemistry of the cast. In fact, the most intriguing sub-plot (the May-December crush between Willie and Marty) would've been an on screen disaster had not the chemistry between Timothy Hutton and Natalie Portman been so on.<br />And as for subtleties, I've watched this film an estimated 25 times and always pick up something new; a line, joke or other character dynamic that went past me before jumps out and I guess that's why I've watched it so much. <br />The only warning I have is this. This movie is billed as a comedy. In reality, you might be choking back more tears than laughter. Although there are some good comedic moments, as a from-the-gut drama, this movie sparkles!
B0000020C4|4.0|My favorite recording (hearing everything but the Full Symphonic) still stands as the London Cast. The Dream Cast is a /close/ second, and I actually only have /one/ itty-bitty problem with this recording. That is: Lea Salonga. Yes, the woman can sing. Yes, she has a /very/ pretty voice. Is she Eponine? No. Does she have /any/ Eponine feel in her singing? No. In all honesty, she sounds very, /very/ American, and it doesn't fit Eponine at /all/. Of course, this is also me (and a lot of other people, I'm sure) brought up hearing French characters played in English with British accents. Probably because the British speak far better than Americans, and, as put in My Fair Lady, &quot;The French don't care what they /do/ actually, as long as they /pronounce/ it properly.&quot; Lea Salonga sounds very, very American. And not even with a Classical sound to it. She just doesn't have the character (and didn't seem to try much for it) of Eponine naturally, or attempted in her inflection and dynamic.<br />Well, enough of that. ^_^;; The rest of the performances are just amazing. Valjean, Javert, Cosette, Marius, Fantine... All perfect and wonderful.<br />So...if Lea Salonga doesn't bother you like she does me, this is a definite CD to buy.
B00005JKL8|4.0|In this interesting military thriller directed by John Moore, Owen Wilson plays a downed navigator being chased by a bunch of rebel Serbian forces.  Gene Hackman plays his superior trying desperately to intervene and save the pilot's life, but caught up in the politics of the situation.  There are a few subplots that make the story interesting, but they are not worth mentioning.  Anyways, the action sequences were pretty strong and Owen Wilson impressed me as a serious actor.  The only drawback was that I wanted him to make a few more jokes, which probably would have slowed down the movie.  But I have one major problem with the movie:  the highly excessive use of the 360 degree panorama spinning shots.  I'm sure there is some technical name for it but thats basically what it is.  The whole movie is spinning, spinning, spinning.  It really got to me after a while.  Although it works in some of the scenes, after you see it about a thousand of times, you get just plain dizzy.  It really detracted from the enjoyment of the picture.
B000002KY8|5.0|This cd is great! I think he should do more movies thoes were pretty good. Great songs and a nice blend of beats that would keep anyone in the mood.
1558908846|5.0|This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante are comic geniuses. YES!! You say 'no' but I say 'yes'. Hollywood could not have made a motion picture event such as this. It was pure Einstein.
0767802659|2.0|This movie is based...loosely...on the great science fiction novel of the same name written by Robert Heinlein.  The book is an all time sci-fi classic about honor, politics, government, and personal struggle.  The movie is a &quot;90210&quot; type parody of this great work.  The movie is technically fine, with good special effects and plenty of gore.  The story in the movie is silly and soap opera compared to the book.  The movie is a waste of your time if you are looking for the great substance science fiction is capable of.  If you want blood, gore, brief nudity...then have at the movie.
B0000541VS|5.0|Sleepers was one of those movies you can't watch without your dark passions for revenge coming out to haunt you!  While in real life it is not wise to seek such horrendous behaviors in the name of 'getting even,' movies may be an appropriate place for mature audiences to vent their feelings of frustration, rebellion, and vengeance.  And Sleepers is a movie that will definitely make you want to do that!<BR>Four young boys called Lorenzo (see other reviews for actor names), Micheal, John and ...They are sent to a corrections institution in 1967 where they meet their guard Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon in a sinister role). ...Eventually the grown John and Tommy, now turned into real, corrupted criminals, kill Nokes in an act of hot-blooded revenge.  Michael then becomes the prosecutor in a sneaky move to help them get away with murder...These guards were also beating up and humiliating the boys in the name of \\"discipline\\" but were really just insecure and trying to display their authority and power.  <br />On the other side of the coin, many diverse groups felt that the movie promoted real-life revenge.  Perhaps it is better that people can vent their feelings in a movie theater than in real life.  Vengeance is a natural human instinct and trying to suppress it by condemning the feeling is ineffective.  This movie serves as a release valve for the times in our lives when we get enraged and want to get even.<br />The theme of this movie from my opinion is \\"Strike Back Against The Oppressor.\\"  What is the oppressor in real life?  I believe it is big government, big business, and paternalistic criminal laws designed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and persecute victimless crimes.  Therefore, in real life Sleepers may not promote violent revenge, but it may promote REBELLION and ANARCHY.  Which may be good to some extent.
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express is a wonderful christmas children's book!  The little boy in the book is swept away Christmas Eve night to the north pole where santa is by a magical train and he witnesses all of the Christmas wonder.  He sees toys being built by santa's elfs and all the goodies being baked by Mrs. Claus.

Christmas morning he opens a small gift that his parents don't know where it came from and he finds the bell that he lost and a note from Santa.  This book will make a believer out of your child!
B000062Y98|5.0|I didn't think they could top &quot;Imaginations&quot; or &quot;Nightfall&quot;, but here's proof of how wrong I was!<br />Incredibly powerful vocals, harmonies, melody... Superb songwriting, even. If you think all fantasy power metal lyrics are silly and cheesy, this album could change your mind. The metal bards tell stories based on The Iliad, Gallileo, Nietzsche, Dragonlance, and more. All the songs are very well thought-out, emotional and inspired (yes, even the Dragonlance one).<br />If you like Blind Guardian, this is a definite 5+ stars must-have. If you like power or progressive metal in general, it still deserves 5 stars.
B000001FN3|5.0|Thinking back.. early 70's music was clashing about till Alan Parsons, Pink Floyd, and a few other very talented artist opened the doors to our minds with the key of enlightenment music. We were dazed and confused at the light as our ears saw majic. To tell the truth I feel very unique to have been part of the early 70's F.M. to mid 80's. I not only began to think but to look within myself when I listened to Alan Parsons which flowed me into the river of other artist's musical waves. I highly advise all Pink Fans &quot;TO START HERE AND GO UP THE LADDER&quot;....Alan has worked on many projects..no pun intended and though I do not have all his work, the sounds of his music revive my brain when cob webs set in. Just what I need to make me feel better!
B000060OWV|4.0|I love Robben's guitar work and I love the blues.  My first impression though is that the vocals lack feeling, lack punch, lack that raunchy edge that puts the feeling into a blues piece by say BB or Stevie Ray or Elmore or Robert ... Of course, for a guitar enthusiast ... that can be a minor drawback.   Listen to the clips, if you love great guitar work you'll probably buy this one.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I must say that I just love THE LION KING...it is my favorite animated Disney classic. To me, THE LION KING is better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and perhaps even SNOW WHITE. To make it all clear: Disney is planning to release THE LION KING in IMAX theaters sometime in January of 2003, and the Platinum DVD is supposed to come out sometime in 2004 (which I will definitely purchase a copy of). You all know the story of Simba...the young African cub who just can't wait to be king. The music to this movie is absolutely wonderful and magical--Elton John and Tim Rice at their best! The voices for each character are perfect--you couldn't have asked for better actors! And the animation is just superb! I can't wait for the DVD and the release in IMAX theaters. I didn't see BEAUTY AND THE BEAST in the IMAX theaters, but if THE LION KING is released in IMAX theaters, then I will definitely see it. I'll be first in line in the Disney store to purchase my very own copy of the DVD when it hits shelves in 2004!
B0000636UN|5.0|This is a great summer CD.  The first track, Steve McQueen, sets the tone for the album.  It's fun, it's easy going, and it's the kind of album you listen to with the top down on a warm, sunny day.  Sheryl teams up with a lot of A-list talent on this album as well, most noticeably Lenny Kravitz on the catchy track, &quot;You're an Original.&quot;  The title track, &quot;c'mon, c'mon,&quot; is a great song.  Sheryl certainly knows how to put out good music.  I'd definitely recommend this album.
B00000J7JO|1.0|REd Hot is not able to perform decently live. This is just a studio band. Their live performances are something that defies reasonable explanation. Their performance in ROCK IN RIO III, in RIo de Janeiro, Brazil, in January, 2001 was something so bad that people could not believe. THose who were fans got disappointed at extreme; those who were not, never will think of buying anything from the band again. This is a fairy-tale band, no substance at all, and CALIFORNICATION is just another step in this process. Get away from this, man.
B00005Y228|4.0|In the 1980s Kylie, age 17, sang like she was 30. Now, age 30, she sings like she's 17. And gets all the FM radio play she could not buy for love nor money in the 1980s. Still the same Euro-dance, 130-plus BPMs, electronic heartbeats, and space-disco passions that made Kylie a cult goddess --- proving that disco immortality has legs yet! Move over Britney &amp; Christina, here's how a young girl voice should sound: delicate, anxious, vulnerable, dreamy, wanting to TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL... Are you that angel? I know I am .....
B000050FEN|5.0|There's nothing bad to say about this film.  The performances are all excellent and the movie is gripping.  It's original and the ending is completely surprising.  It's in a similar style to \\"Fight Club\\" in that the director took another social issue--the decline of \\"morality\\" in this case--and made us think twice about both the victims and the perpetrators, and twice about right and wrong.
0201633612|1.0|This book is not a good choice for a person that is begining in design patterns. He is confused and the examples do not help to understand it. I have just one advice for people that are trying to learn pattern, this book certainly should not be your first choice.
B000021YQV|1.0|I may not be 14 or hip to what the kids today listen to. But with lyrics like \\"I dont think u trust in my self righteous suicide\\", a video of the lead singer wearing a shirt with a tank on it,a song called jet pilot and another song that starts out with \\"there is toxicity(anthrax) in our city. Even I know its obvious. These guys support terrorsim. If you have your doubts read the back cover of their first album, it discusses how in the 21 st century the world will experience biological and chemical terrorism to combat the opression of those in foreign lands.Oh and not to mention the upside down american flag on the back of the record.Now maybe this is all just a coincidence.Nahh<BR>Dont support terrorism and dont buy this album
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl Crow's latest C'mon C'mon is almost really good, but the middle three tracks drag it down. The best tracks are the lead &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and the closer &quot;Weather Channel&quot;. These tracks represent the differences that exist on this album. One is a upbeat rocker while the other is hauntingly low-key accoustic marvel. Everything seems in perfect order -- the songs are brilliantly written and classic Sheryl, the music is fun rock -- as usual. You are convinced that Sheryl is back better than ever, but by the time you reach her laughable duet &quot;It's So Easy&quot; with Don Henley and the terrible &quot;Over You&quot; you may just start to lose faith. Don't worry, however, after one more mishap &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;, she pulls the record back on track and redeems herself with &quot;It's Only Love&quot; and &quot;Diamond Road&quot; before moving onto the wonderful &quot;Abilene&quot;. I was anxiously awaiting this album, because I believe Sheryl Crow is one of the best singer songwriters around. She has never disappointed. While C'mon C'mon is not exactly what I was expecting, I believe it is definitely worth buying because the good far outwieghs the bad. Perhaps after a few more listens, even I will start to enjoy those pesky middle tracks.
B0000636UN|5.0|The first release from this album is 'Soak Up The Sun' which is the best catchy summer type song I've heard since Alan Jacksons' 'Chattahoochee'. The video is great also. On this album she's joined by the likes of Stevie Nicks and Don Henley (she toured with both), also Keith Richards, Emmylou Harris, Lenny Kravitz and others. She either wrote/co-wrote all the songs, sang and produced. This is truly a labor of love for Sheryl. Check out the haunting 'Weather Report' with Emmylou Harris. Not a dud on this album.
6301640659|4.0|An Undercover Cop (Oscar-Winner:Al Pacino), who Must Investigate the Underground Gay S&M Scene to Trap a Brutal Serial Killer.<br />Written and Directed by Oscar-Winner:William Freidkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection, 12 Angry Men-Remake), Based on the Novel by Gerald Walker. The Film is Often Confusing, Slow-Going, Uncomfortally Explicit at Times and Marred by a Cop-Out Ending. Although Friedkin`s Unapologetic Direction still makes for an Exceptionally Creepy Atmosphere and Numerous Disturbing Murder Sequences. This is a Mixed Bag at Best and The Moody Score by Jack Nitzsche is Good. This is a Very Underrated Film. Grade:B+.
0446608955|5.0|This book titled A Walk to Remember is very touching and sad.  I wanted to read this book ever since I heard about it.  This book is about a boy named Landon Carter who doesn't have true feelings for a girl until he met Jamie Sullivan.  He and his friends used to make fun of her because she used to wear the same old gray sweater and reads the bible everyday.  She was the daughter of a minister.  Landon fell for Jamie because of the play.  Jamie asked Landon a favor in participating for the school play.  He did, but he didn't really enjoy it.  Also, Jamie asked if he could walk her home to her house, and he agreed.  The night of the school play, he had never seen Jamie so..so..beautiful.  She played the part of the angel.  She had her hair down and not in a bun, and she was wearing a beautiful white gown.  That's when he started to like her.  There was one thing that Jamie didn't tell him, however.  Jamie had leukemia.  When Landon heard about this, he was shocked.  The girl that he loved was dying.  So, he spent a lot of time with her.  Jamie's dream was to be married in a church with a lot of people.  So Landon made it come true.  Weeks later, however, Jamie died.<BR>  I liked this story a lot. I felt like I was going to cry at the end because they had gotten married, but Jamie died.  Landon loved this girl so much that he didn't know what to do to keep her alive.  He knew he was missing something, and he finally asked her.  I was heart-broken when Jamie died.  That was nice of Landon to walk her home to her house and finally notice the inside of her.  After Landon got to know her real well, he didn't make fun of her.  He had feelings for her.  He was in love.  He didn't care what his friends thought about him liking a girl like Jamie Sullivan.  All he wanted was to be with her, forever.<BR>  My favorite part of the book was when Landon asked Jamie if she wanted to marry him.  When Landon came to her house, she was in bed.  She couldn't get up because she was to weak.  Then he sat by her side, saying the words, \\"Will you marry me?\\" I was touched by that part.  I had to read it over again and again.  First he asks if she loves him.  Then she says,\\"yes.\\"  I was about to cry, but I had to save my tears until I finish the book.  I think that pther teenage girls will love this story.  I really enjoy this heart warming, romantic book.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Easily Lynch's low point.  An aimless, rambling waste of time and technology.  Surely there are more worthwhile uses of electricity than to power DVD players to run this lousy movie.<br />But what is especially insulting is the very high price on this DVD.  There isn't a single extra feature of any consequence, which is evidently Lynch's decision.  Fine and good.  But this single DVD costs more than most double DVD sets.  Why?  Is it printed on extra-high quality DVD stock?  No, looks about the same to me.  Are the liner notes really special?  No.  Is there anything about this release to justify the jacked up price?<br />No.  Not a single thing.<br />Save your money.  Wait for Eraserhead to come out on DVD, and see what Lynch is capable of when he is working at his best.  Avoid this overheated overhyped load of nonsense.

B00004XQ83|4.0|This soundtrack is great. I also highly recommend the movie! Watching the film on my campus movie channel got me hooked on the most popular track, &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and since I enjoyed the other songs I put this CD on my wishlist. A good friend bought it for me and let me tell you, I'm extremely jazzed! Other great tracks are &quot;Down To The River To Pray&quot; sung by the Alison Krauss. Her vocal work and violin playing are a highlight on this soundtrack. Listening to the CD is almost as good as watching the movie. The CD tells a story with songs and there are several different versions of &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; performed by several artists and with varying sounds to them which really is a treat.<br />I adore the music on this soundtrack. It gets you up and dancing and singing right along! You know it's good music when it gets stuck in your head and you wind up humming it all day. I do with this soundtrack and I bet you will too!
0790729342|4.0|There are a lot of loud, whining engines in THE ROAD WARRIOR.  There are people being killed, maimed and immolated.  Of the characters who survive this tale, very few come through without scars.<br />It's a post-apocalyptic nightmare where hope fights despair.  The irony of Max's character is that even though he's one of the good guys, he's probably the most desperate of the lot.  This is the tale of Max's pain and how he rose above it to become a legend.<br />This is not the same Max we saw in MAD MAX.  This Max has been poisoned by tragedy and loss, and the anger of the past has refined into a tiny hard ball of self-involvement.  It seems fitting that civilization fell so soon after Max suffered his losses--almost as though when Max lost his place in the world, the world changed to find a new place for him.<br />THE ROAD WARRIOR touches on one aspect of the end-of-the-world scenario that has always fascinated me:  if the world ends, how many of the survivors will know how and why it happened?<br />These people don't have time to contemplate that--the once-civilized world has become an enormous hunting ground where the prize is the precious little bit of gasoline that remains.  With the world in shambles, the only things left for most people to do are eat, make love, drive really fast, and die.  In the midst of all these lost souls, one small group has manufactured hope by restarting a refinery and producing enough gasoline to allow them to escape to a better place.<br />THE ROAD WARRIOR is so far removed from the fallen civilized world it replaced that we don't even get a sense that any of these people even remember what the world was like before.  We haven't got a clue what any of them did prior to the fall.  (Yes, we know Max was a policeman, but we know that from MAD MAX--it's never really touched upon, here.)  In THE ROAD WARRIOR, the conflict has been distilled to an abstraction, with the good guys as desperate in their Hope as the bad guys are desperate in their Despair.<br />It catches you up from the beginning, rocking your screen and your sensibilities with high-speed stuff that, for once, isn't mindless.  How long can you survive in a world where people are willing to kill you for whatever gasoline remains in the tank of your car?  You bet you'd run, and run fast and hard.  It's a horribly Darwinistic world where the desire to hold on to some small facet of the past drives people to lives so pointless they don't even bother to ask why they're living this way.  Heaven help you if you actually want to take the tools of the past and use them to build a real future.<br />This is, no question, a 5-star movie in my mind, but it's a 4-star DVD--the print used for the transfer is grainy, and it seems like the illumination was inconsistent.  The whole thing feels a bit washed-out.  Special features?  What's that?  For a legendary film like this, it's criminal not to have given us substantial bonus material.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the only movie that has ever made me so overwhelmingly happy that I cried.  I don't cry very often, and I'm not overly sappy, its just that good.  My favorite movies used to be Fight Club, American Beauty and The Fifth Element, and now things have changed.  Amelie was so nicely made it is hard to immagine not loving it.  The cinemotography is top notch and inventive.  The story is sweet and relatable while remaining charming and funny throughout.  Audrey Tautou is painfully cute.  This DVD seems to be the perfect showcase for the movie, the box looks gorgeous and the features blow me away based on description.  In order for this to not be worth buying it would have to be a terrible DVD transfer that skips or something, which would be criminal.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|There's no doubt about it: Rufus Wainwright is my favorite singer/songwriter.  I even wrote about a song of his (from his first album) for my music history class.  That's how much I love this guy.<br />I was extremely excited when I heard he was releasing a second album.  It did not disappoint.  Poses is every bit as good as the first one, if not better.  The songs tell stories, ooze emotion, and are great to listen to.  The way Rufus sings gives us insight to his soul.<br />My favorite song on this album is One Man Guy (although my selection for favorite changes about every week).
B000005S6B|5.0|I've played this album at countless parties for people who had never heard of the Pogues.  From the first strains of &quot;If I Should Fall From Grace With God&quot;, the place just jumped!  I mean literally...and that's what this album is, a rollicking, drunken, 24-hour party.  You can just smell the inside of a pub listening to this and not stop jumping and stomping your foot.  this is not toe-tapping music....this is foot-stompin' anarchy. What is particularly enthralling about this album is that while it certainly has a strong punk influence, the Pogues committment to traditional roots music is evident. It's amazing what a tight band the Pogues used to be, and this album, along with Rum, Sodomy and The Lash is their enduring legacy.
0792837614|5.0|West Side Story is probably one of the greatest musicals of all time.  And as far as musicals-turned-movies go, this is one of the best examples of it.  The choreography is amazing--and even though the idea of a dancing street gang is normally completely unbelieveable, we believe it in the musical setting.  Bernstein's music and Sondheim's lyrics created a masterpiece in West Side Story.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I fear to say this, as I myself fear this accomplishment, but this movie is a Masterpiece.  It has every emotion that makes humankind live and die; happiness, terror, sadness, lust, love, awkwardness, goodness, guilt and evil.  Plus, the appearance of Angelo, the whole ambiance of the movie, and knowing that the greatest Artist alive today made this film, definitely made it a chest chiller.  The lacing of life is weaved through this movie as if it were done by a being who owned the soul of Carl Jung, Salvador Dali, and Sigmund Freud swirled in to one, I guess that is David...  Life is funny and this movie weaves that in a spectacular knot! ... In short, if you are a Lynch fan and love the plots he weaves, the way he directs and his masterful eye for light, ... then this movie is for you.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Gone in 60 Seconds is one of those flash trash car chase brainless action popcorn muncher films with big bangs but not so much brains. But it's elevated above the staple car chase limitations by Nicholas Cage and Giovanni Ribisi. The female lead however, Angelina Jolie, is wasted in this film, with nothing much to do except look sexy.<br />It's a Jerry Bruckheimer film, so it does have a fair amount of cool car chases and big noisy things exploding. But this, unlike Bruckheimer's other films (The Rock, Con Air, Armaggedeon) is somewhat short of any really good car chases. And director Dominic Sena (Swordfish) wastes most of the time on boring sub-plots instead of what the audience really wants: action.<br />In short, if you're looking for a brainless entertaining flick with \\"that Tomb Raider chick\\" then this is the film for you. But if what you want is a film with cool cars and really great action, check out The Fast and the Furious instead.
B000001FTH|3.0|I am a &quot;rock and guitar&quot; man, but there is something appealing about many of Grace Jones' efforts. Her vocals can be very effective such as in her fine cover of La Vie en Rose. Even the idea of someone like her tacklng a song like that is unusual to put it mildly. But she carries it off very well and the strong accordion work (or accordion-synth) gives a distinctly European feel to many of her songs. Also she just has a first rate band of backing musicians with superb bass and marvellously atmospheric keyboards that can be positively intoxicating. My favorites are &quot;La Vie on Rose&quot;, &quot;I've seen that Face Before&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot;. I challenge you not to be swept along by the great rhythms on these. I want the man who composed those basslines in my band (I'm sure it was not Grace)!
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I can't believe that people I've read their revies and I can't believe that they actually give it a 1 star or 2 stars. I mean COM' ON! This album hits the celling, it rockz. Jennifer Lopez did a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GREAT JOB making this project. Now she has 3 album's out. Which they are, On The 6, J.LO, and J To Tha .Lo (Remixez!). I've got only On The 6, which is VERY GREAT album like I said. My fav songs are &quot;If you had my love&quot; , &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; and &quot;Should've Never!&quot; VERY GREAT work Jen. This album should be in your music collection today, soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo out and get it:-) Don't listen to those poor reviewers who are saying this CD suckz, cos it doesn't. Just PLEASE buy it,today!K?
0446608955|5.0|I've been hooked to any books by Nicholas Sparks after reading this book. It's simply fabulous! All my friends who borrowed this book from me got their eyes swollen. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is really touching but at times can be humorous. Best of all, it doesn't include any sex scenes so this is a very clean read. The movie, on the other hand, is quite disappointing because the way the story is told is very different. But you'll only feel that way if you read the book first. Like me. ;)
0875847706|5.0|Having been brought up in the north of England where stoicism is still more highly prized than emotional candour, I have always been suspicious of &quot;self-help&quot; books. Consequently when a collegue gave me a copy of The Art of Possibility, I approached it with some cynicism, or at least with scepticism.<BR>I need not have worried because this is in no way a self-help book. Readers will find no quick fixes or tricks here, and so it is bound to disappoint those seeking psychological sticking-plasters (as we can see in a review below). Rather the Zanders offer sets of practices - \\"possibilities to live into\\" - which, due to the way society has conditioned us, are extremely demanding to put into practise. Each idea is illustrated with real life accounts from the Zanders to demonstrate the idea in action. Most impressive is the willingness and honesty with which the Zanders discuss their own faults and mistakes. This rather proves the point that the ideas they propose are in no way easy to perfect, in this less than perfect world. Just as in learning a musical instrument, or acquiring a new skill there are no shortcuts. However, as with most worthwhile skills, the effort is more than repaid by the consequences of living into possibility.<BR>The greatest compliment that I can pay the Zanders is that I have read and re-read the book many times, and practice it every day. I can't claim to be successful, but in the attempt have created waves that continue to open up possibilities I would not have considered possible before I read this book.<BR>I highly recommend The Art of Possibility to anybody seriously seeking to release their full potential from the control of our human conditioning.
B00001OH7P|4.0|What makes a classic period album?  Well, it obviously has to encapsulate a period and sound that will no longer exist in the decade next to come or will influence a future genre of music.  The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, released in 1972, does just that, coming as it did in a decade of uncertainty, pollution, and in the following year, the fuel crisis of 1973.  The chorus of \\"Five Years,\\" sung through the title spaceman, states:  \\"We've got five years/etc.\\"  ... And think of the industrialized glut that Britain was in.  A bleak prospect for those living in the UK, and small wonder why all that made Ziggy's brain ache.<br />Two of the songs were previously released in demo versions under the pseudonym Arnold Corns.  Those were \\"Moonage Daydream\\" and \\"Hang On To Yourself.\\"  Both have been given the Ziggy-glam treatment here.<br />The single \\"Starman\\" recaps the message from \\"Five Years\\" and tells us \\"not to blow it/Cause he knows it's all worthwhile/He told me:  Let the children lose it/Let the children use it/Let all the children boogie.\\"  Not a bad message considering the pessimism of the era.  So basically, life and the planet's all worthwhile, let the children go wild,..., and party.  Not a problem, provided they don't compromise the safety of non-involved others.<br />\\"Lady Stardust\\" is a nice slow piano interlude to the piano boogie of \\"Star,\\" where Ziggy lands on Earth and becomes a rock and roll star.  The last four block of songs are familiar ones.  The fast-paced \\"Hang On To Yourself\\" with its punkish guitar and short running time heralds the punk movement five years before the Sex Pistols. That could be another interpretation of the five years.<br />\\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\" are often run back-to-back on radio and small wonder--\\"Ziggy\\" flows into \\"Suffragette City\\" smoothly.  Like \\"Hang On,\\" \\"Suffragette\\"'s intensity presages the punk movement half a decade later.  With the acoustic and string-laden \\"Rock And Roll Suicide,\\" Ziggy's energy and star power has been spent, leaving him a drained fraction of his former glorious self.<br />Mick Ronson's snarling proto-punk guitar is the real star here, establishing the sound that made Ziggy Stardust one of the 1970's most essential albums.  This trend was continued with the succeeding album Aladdin Sane.  Ziggy would make one more appearance in a belated live album release, and that would be it, as Pinups, Diamond Dogs and Young Americans experimented with different musical stylings altogether, but the legend would remain after \\"the kids had killed the man.\\"y and star power has been spent, leaving him a drained fraction of his former glorious self.<br />Mick Ronson's snarling proto-punk guitar is the real star here, establishing the sound that made Ziggy Stardust one of the 1970's most essential albums.

B00005JKED|5.0|You HAVE to see this movie!  It's one of the best movies of the year.  This is actually one of the only movies that I can tolerate Denzel Washington in (the other being The Hurricane).  I was surprised at how great this film is considering all of the so-so to bad reviews that I read about it.  This film is a refreshing break from all the dramas out there and that were in the Oscar race this year like A Beautiful Mind and In The Bedroom (both of them were excellent but Training Day was a sigh of relief).  Denzel's acting as a evil narcotics cop was surpassed me expectations.  He delivered his evilness without a glance, as if he were naturally like that, which is every actor's goal.  He was entirely believable in every aspect throughout the whole movie.  Ethan Hawke was his co-star in the movie (another acting job that surprised people at how good he is and definitely deserved the Oscar nod).  Hawke and Washington sort of acted off each other and did it well since their chemistry is great.  When Washington accepted his Oscar at the awards show last month, I think everybody realized how many times he really should have been up there.  That Oscar went to him for Training Day especially, but also for the awards he didn't win for (just to name a few) The Hurricane, Malcolm X, and others.  If you're still not sure if you should see this movie, see it because you will like it and you will be surprised at how much you love and hate Denzel's character at the same time.  Plus, you can see some cameos from Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is a great album, whether or not you've ever been a Dylan fan. The songwriting and musicianship are top notch; the songs are witty, soulful and tuneful. Po' Boy is my favorite, for its clever, wistful lyrics and catchy tune...it ranks with the best of Dylan's work in this vein.
6301174240|4.0|Michael isn't good at movie plots. But Moonwalker is definitely worth adding to your collection. You can ff past the corny stuff and get right to the music. If you like things from the Claymation studio, you must watch Speed Demon. I am disappointed that a segment was cut out that was considered politically incorrect. That is the Japanese tourists with the cameras. But that's OK. If you didn't see the original, you would never notice it. It would have been nice if BAD and BADDER had been put back to back, but they aren't even on the same videos. <br />One of the things that puzzles me about this series is they included the Pepsi commercial and the song from Ben, but nothing about the WIZ. I loved the WIZ. <br />I suggest buying HIStory volume one and two along with Moonwalker, if you never buy any thing else. Truly in my opinion the greatest music, dance and special effects ever created.
B0000636UN|4.0|love the record, love sheryl, love the direction.  love soak up the sun for a light spirited lift.  really a great record. am loving it more each listen!
1573300659|5.0|Anyone who is even vaguely familiar with The King of POP knows that he likes to make mini movies instead of normal length videos. Some of the videos are cut mercifully short, getting rid of tedious story lines. This is nice. I just want to see the dancing, the music and the special effects. <br />HIStory volume two is just marvelous to watch over and over. One of the complaints I have is that the segment Brace Yourself is used on both volumes one and two...<br />Although volume one has the bare essentials from the early years, volume two has the superior videos. That only makes sense because they are newer. Volume two also has more political, earth and world themes. His anger at the media comes out in these videos. You must check out the Grammy award winning Scream.
B00005R87Q|2.0|The hype finally got to me and I rented &quot;the fast and the furious' to see if it was any good.  I got mixed reviews from all around so I figured seeing it for myself was the only way to go.  And all I can say is: What a waste of a rental.  The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was, of course, the cars.  They were all very nice and I suppose that's where the producers spent all the money for the film because it certainly wasn't on obtaining a good script.  The movie does show some promise but that falls apart when scenes are short and cut together.  The plot came together too quickly and just didn't give you much.  It was like &quot;An under cover cop wastes a lot of money driving cool cars trying to find an armed thief.&quot;  And as always, he gets a little too close to the enemy and he his torn between his job and his emotions and ultimately he finds a way to satisfy both.<BR>It just left you completely empty.  You lost the money for renting (or buying), you wasted your time, and the hype was false.<BR>Two stars for the Racing Scenes and nice cars.  But not really worth the buy or the viewing other than that.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I didn't expect to like this movie.  I heard it was miserable, but I liked Josh Hartnett in Black Hawk Down, so I rented it. I liked it better than I thought I would.  The first part of the movie, the boring romance between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, couldn't keep my interest. The scenes of the Japanese planning the attack were useless. Then Ben Affleck did the best thing he could have done in a film: He died. Hartnett and Beckinsale convinced me much more than Affleck did, and I found myself getting interested.  I don't know about history, so I can't judge on historical accuracies, but it's impossible to tell the whole story of Pearl Harbor. You have to have some angle, but honestly, I would rather have gotten rid of Ben Affleck altogether, seen the story through the eyes of the nurse played by Beckinsale and the pilot played by Hartnett. That might be my personal preference, but those characters were the ones that held my interest. Ben Affleck was as usual, Ben Affleck. He hasn't interested me since Chasing Amy.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best CDs I have ever bought. Mechanical Animals is, I feel, the best Marilyn Manson album ever put out, and one of the best albums I've ever heard, period. The music has the most unique sound, with lyrics that will actually make you think about the state of the world today. While Manson's other albums have their high and low points, this album is great all the way through. The first time I ever heard Manson in my life was from this album, and I new right then I had to have it. If he were ever able to top this album in some way, I think I would run outside and do a cartwheel because this has been one of my favorite pieces of music for three years now.
B000002C2E|1.0|This album is a dirge.  And a mess.  The Academy was out of their minds to award it a Grammy.  If you want to hear the power and brilliance of Dylan, PLEASE forego this one and skip to his 60's and 70's work. This is one of the artists poorer efforts, and the fact that it has garnered such accolades is a testament  to the pitiable state of current day music. Don't waste your time, there are a hundred great Dylan songs, none of which are here.  He has lost it and is over the hill only the reviewers are too dumbed down to notice.
B000003BF1|5.0|The Rolling Stones America tour was the defining moment to end the Swinging Sixties, taking live Rock `n' Roll to a completely new level of Sonic Sophistication (a word that most Americans didn't think Mick Jagger could spell at the time, little knowing that he was a good old ex Dartford Grammar school boy). However, as the carnage that developed at the band's end of tour free concert proved, the rising counter-culture had its dark side.<br />So \\"Let It Bleed\\" suited the times perfectly. At one point it's rough and aggressive, the next mild and reflective. Restless and combative, the album expresses the dawning awareness that came as the sixties drew to a close and the seventies stretched ahead of us.<br />Opening gambit \\"Gimmie Shelter\\", more than most of the songs here, encapsulates the dread that lurks within the excitement. As Mick warns us that the storms are rising, sung over the slowly growling licks from the guitars, you can't help but wonder whether these guys knew a thing or two.<br />Brian Jones only gets one credit on the whole album for percussion on \\"Midnight Rambler\\". To make up for this, a few friends were brought in to fill out the sound, add depth, light, shade and variety. Glyn Johns and Jimmy Miller were retained from the Beggars Banquet Sessions to fill the engineering and production roles respectively, and the wonderful Nicky Hopkins was persuaded to lend his nimble digits to most of the keyboard roles. On several tracks the quest artists nearly steal the show. Ry Cooder's mandolin on \\"Love In Vain\\" must be some of his finest work ever; Mary Clayton out Jagger's Mick on the counter part vocals on \\"Gimmie Shelter\\"; and \\"Country Honk\\" (the two-stepping country alter ego of \\"Honk Tonk Women\\") has some fiddle by Byron Berline that just makes your feet want to tap.<br />But the absolute masterstroke was bringing in the London Bach Choir to add their considerable presence to the climax of final cut \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", closing the album in all it's glorious seven and a half minutes. This song will always remain at the pinnacle of the Stones achievements. But then every track on this album is a gem, so perhaps just one track should not be singled out. It's the entire concept of the whole of \\"Let It Bleed\\" that makes it work.<br />It also saw the final swansong to the Stones recording the blues with their murky version of Robert Johnson's \\"Live With Me\\". Although Bill Wyman plays bass throughout the album, it was actually Keith Richards who plays the amazing bass intro to this track. \\"You Got The Silver\\" is arguably the best lead vocal track that Mr. Richards ever laid down.<br />It was eighteen months before the Stones gave us another single and album (both worldwide number ones in \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\") by which time they had created there own record label and became tax exciles. Of course we did get the live album of this America tour to keep us interested (\\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out\\"), but had not the Stones rallied over these past twelve months, I doubt very much that the legend would of continued.<br />The Stones had many glory years in front of them, and even now you never know. They still might have a trick or two up their sleeves, they can certainly still cut it live, in fact they seem to get better and better. There have been a few casualties, a few ups with the downs. Mick Taylor left as he required something more productive (well, we are still waiting for you to set the world alright, Mick) but that was no sweat as Ronnie Wood fitted in much better anyway. Several sidemen have gone to the great gig in the sky, Ian Stewart, Nicky Hopkins, and Jimmy Miller, whilst Bill Wyman retired to run a restaurant. But they are still out there, the greatest Rock `n' Roll band in the world. Ronnie with that Benson & Hedges hanging from his lips as he reaches for the slide; Charlie Watts stone faced as ever with an even more dapper suit on; Mick Jagger making headlines every time he even looks at a young lady; and Keith Richards...

B000003BEM|5.0|\\"Beggars Banquet\\" was definitely a make or break album for The Stones. Even with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" that summer of 68, this album was released on the run up to Christmas 1968, and failure would of left them still languishing in the pop group file with a habit of bringing out hit singles. But when The Stones needed a classic, the Glimmer Twins (Mick Jagger and Keith Richards) obliged.<br />From the opening percussion of first track \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" you know you are indeed about to embark on a very special journey. After being hounded by the establishment for the last 12 months, here was Mick Jagger pouting and preening at the front of the band giving it his all, throwing down the challenge, and \\"Hey\\", \\"Yeah\\", \\"May be I am Lucifer, what are you going to do about it\\". Then when Keith Richards comes ripping up on his guitar during the solo breaks, Rock `n' Roll has been redefined. It's the devil's music and they are proud of it. Of course it was all very tongue in cheek, but then your Mum and Dad would never know that. \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" is a classic Rock `n' Roll track often imitated but never bettered, and is an absolute must in the present Stones Live set list.<br />Next track up, just to keep you wondering, the Stones drag out an inspiring heartbreaking ballad in \\"No Expectations\\" confessing that even if you are a Rolling Stones, love does not always run true. In fact, over the ten tracks on \\"Beggars Banquet\\" the Stones run the gauntlet of all their many talents from the out and out Rock `n' Roll songs (\\"Street Fighting Man\\" and the heavy \\"Parachute Woman\\"), the only ever autobiographical Stones song in \\"Jig Saw Puzzle\\", where each member is mentioned, their roots in \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", a tribute to the fans for sticking to them through thick and thin \\"Salt Of The Earth\\", to the hysterically funny \\"Dear Doctor\\", which may bring a wry smile to some of Pattaya's residents.<br />All the facets of the Stones at full force are on display, Jagger's singing and sensuous harmonica play, the rock hard rhythm section of Wyman & Watts, the straight men to the flamboyant front duo. Best of all though is Keith Richards's guitar work, which lights up every track whether it being his thunderous rhythm works, his slide guitar or lightning solos, you know you are listening to a master at work.<br />Brian Jones (although making a wonderful cameo in the artwork, where all of the Stones revel in their own decadence) was drifting away from the band. In fact, any guitar work he did lay down was soon wiped clear by the others. But the altered group dynamic appears to have liberated Mick and Keith as writers.<br />Here is where they first display to transcend their influences, past and present to create a sort of beautiful monster, not for just one single, but for a whole album. The Stones had a rough passage through the Flower Power era, but came out the other side harder, flasher - with their eyes re-opened.<br />These songs on \\"Beggars Banquet\\" are the sound of rock mythology being born.<br />The album never actually went number one an either side of the Atlantic (top five though), but stayed on the charts for six months, as the word spread that the Stones were back.<br />The trouble was that they had now been in all but name reduced to a quintet.

B00003CXWV|1.0|It's amazing to me that so many people liked this movie because I just don't get it..., so you know that the story is basically the rise and fall of a drug dealing fool.  I found it hard to sympathize with George Jung's predicament because he's so completely responsible for it.  Am I supposed to feel for a man who sold drugs?  It's not like he was the man stealing bread to feed his family.  Johnny Depp is a great actor, but I wonder how many of these horrible roles he's going to take on.  Even with his charm, I could not bring myself to 1) like George as a character, or 2) like the movie.  The story was pretty standard, something I've seen a dozen times before... only not as good.  All you have to do nowadays is have a thin story, a nice soundtrack with old songs to reminisce by, and to set the time period, and a couple of montages, and your done.  Oh, I hear Cream, then it must be the 60s!  Wait, is that Wham?  Must be the 80's!  I suggest \\"Goodfellas\\" if you want to see a good movie on the criminal lifestyle.  Blow is a retread of better movies... though some might call that an homage.  Yea, right, an homage... that's what Blow wanted to be.  (I'm being sarcastic)  Better just pass this one by, unless your a uber Johnny Depp fan.  And even then, he's made better movies than this... go get those instead.

0780020685|5.0|Let me set anyone who thinks that Seven Samurai is a remake of Magnificent Seven... IT'S NOT!  It's the other way around.  I read someone else's review on there who stated it was the other way around.  Akira Kurosawa's movies were the inspiration for many a western... Seven Samurai - Magnificent Seven, Yojimbo - A Fist Full of Dollars, to name two.  So, to anyone who goes around saying that American films are never inspired by foreign films, your wrong.  Take some time to see a few of these great films for yourself.  As for Seven Samurai, I can't say much other that it's perfect.  Three hours feel short with this epic.  There is not a moment wasted.  Each event has effects on other events in the film.  There is more character development in Samurai than in the Magnificent Seven, so already that's a plus.  Magnificent Seven is a good movie, but I think it pales in comparison to the original.  Back to Samurai...  I love the movie because it has wonderful character development, but also a lot of action.  The last hour of this movie is as action packed as any movie.  Yet, there's a moral to the story.  In short, Seven Samurai is an incredible film that makes you wonder, how is it that more movies don't try for the same excellence.  And, don't pass up other Akira Kurosawa films.  He was a wonderful film maker who made some incredible movies.  \\"Ikiru,\\" in my opinion, is his masterpiece.  But, like all great artists, he had more than one masterpiece.  Don't miss \\"High and Low,\\" \\"Yojimbo,\\" or \\"Rashomon,\\" as well as his other movies.
B00005JKJA|5.0|i've found that something interesting has happened over the course of repeat viewings of this film (4 times since i bought the DVD last week). all of the artifice, the mystery, the amorphous tie-ins of murky sub-plots and confounding imagery that initially clouded my brain has given way to a single raw emotion that i'm left with as the end credits roll: sadness.<br />i wouldn't characterize myself as a particularly emotional person, but the last time i watched \\"mulholland drive\\" in its entirety (just last night, it so happens), i was left in tears.  i really feel that this film is not just some elaborate con game that lynch is playing on his audience, as some of my fellow, rather embittered reviewers have claimed. it's not some smug, showy, empty Display with a capital \\"D\\" in the vein of \\"the usual suspects.\\" <br />for me, at least, the real resonance of this film rests in the character arc of diane selwyn. the australian actress naomi watts is nothing less than startling in her portrayal of one young woman's devastating transformation at the hands of the hollywood \\"dream factory.\\" it's a real testament to naomi's formidable talent that many of the people that i've seen this film with were not quick to recognize her in the latter section of the film. they thought that she had become a different person. and, indeed, she had. <br />the true beauty, the true power of this film, for me, lies in the mental juxtaposition of two images: one is of a disheveled diane selwyn standing in the kitchen of her dim apartment, clad in an old, dirty night gown, holding a brown coffee cup, her body shaking before the hallucinatory image of the lover she thought she had lost forever; the other is one that lynch closes the film with -- diane and camilla together, beaming with happiness, basking in the hollywood glow of moviestardom. this latter image fades away and we are brought back to the club silencio, in which the blue-haired madam of truth, reality, and an almost cruel justice declares that all is again silent.
B00003CWTI|4.0|P.T. Anderson has created one of the most compelling films in the last two decades with his MAGNOLIA. Having been pleasantly surprised by HARD EIGHT (due mostly to John C. Reilly's wonderful characterization), and stunned by BOOGIE NIGHTS, I was amped for the release of MAGNOLIA. Why I didnt' go see it in the theatre is beyond me (too busy I guess, and now I regret not making time for it), but it was one of the first DVDs I rented after I got my player, and now I am happy to say I own it. Of course, there's nothing knew about this type of storytelling, Altman has been doing it for years (most magically in SHORT CUTS), but what is amazing is the depth of the characters and story here. Not that Altman doesn't have deep stories or characters, but Anderson was just a 29-year old &quot;kid&quot; when he made this film. I feel a bit meek pondering this, as I'm a year older than him. Anyway, Anderson fleshes out each character, with the help of some brilliant acting (John C. Reilly is again a stand-out to me), and inspired moments. I'd heard about the frogs before I saw the movie, but was still surprised when they finally arrived. Beyond that, each story line is compelling, and interweaved with a delightful abandon, I love the opening five minutes with its frantic pace. As I said the acting is brilliant, with one exception; why Tom Cruise got all the notice and accolades for his performance is beyond me. Yes, it's a stretch for him, but I don't feel he pulled it off. When I watch the movie I believe in all the other characters, but when Cruise is on the screen I think, &quot;There's Tom Cruise ACTING like a sleazebag.&quot; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Reilly, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, and Jason Robards deserve the credit Cruise received. My hat's off to Anderson for this epic undertaking, and I look forward to his next. Only four stars because of my Cruise embargo.
B0000636UN|5.0|Whatever Sheryl has been doing to stay in tune and grow more creative- it's been working - as displayed in this new collection. This record will satisfy all your rock taste buds, or music buds for that matter, with several rock and roll tracks (Steve McQueen-, You're An Original) which have the unique Sheryl Crow trademark sound yet will fondly remind you of some classic tunes of 70's rock. The kids will definitely enjoy the more pop - Soak up The Sun. In addition the more subdued and tranquil tracks all bring out that great angelic voice. C'mon C'mon gives one a snapshot into the incredible range of Sheryl Crow's artistry which is why so many music legends are willing to perform with her. The more you listen- as with almost all her work, you will grow to appreciate her music more.
6303430570|5.0|one word describes this movie, &quot; CLASSIC&quot; This movie opens up the world of Cult Hits, especially with the Jersey set!! From This one ( Clerks) to Jay and Silent Bob, these movies are the one of a kind to hit the screen. Kevin Smith is the &quot; MAN&quot;. He kept them going on through his movies and I ( we) appericiate it!! I hope he brings them back in a cameo in another movie he does!! Thanks again Kevin!!
B00000JG41|5.0|After yet another three-year break from 1995's bizaare work of art Disco Volante, and the break-up of musical genius Mike Patton's more well-known group Faith No More, fans were pleasantly surprised yet again, as Mr. Bungle's 3rd album California was released in 1999. And everybody was surprised yet again, when it ended up sounding nothing like the previous two!<BR>  Firstly, its only 45 minutes instead of over an hour. And instead of wild demented party music or sheer experimental weirdness, we get....regular songs!!!  But, breathe easy. Patton and the gang's musical diversity is better than ever on this album, and you still get every music style you can think of, and then some! All 10 songs are pure masterpieces, and as a result, California is just as awesome and jaw-dropping as the first two.<BR>  Whether you crave mellow dream-pop (Retrovertigo), heavy metal polka (Ars Morandi), piano-driven gospel (The Holy Filament), Hawaiian surf (Sweet Charity), or trademark Bungle weirdness (Golem II: The Bionic Vapor Boy, Goodbye Sober Day), you're in for the ride of your life. <BR>   If you're anxious but skeptical to dive into Mr. Bungle, this is the perfect place to start. Despite Mike Patton's involvement in about four groups at once now, Mr. Bungle is still alive and in hibernation, and there will no doubt be another album in a year or two. In the meantime, California will rarely leave my CD player.  :-)
0446608955|5.0|A walk to remember is the most beautiful book in the entire universe, seriously.  Jamie and Landon are just a heart-warming couple.  The first part of the book was not very interesting, but as I moved on to the middle, the story and the plot started falling back in and touched my heart. I know I may be young, thirteen years old, but this book to me is the most the most touching, heartbreaking story I've read in my entire life.  Towards the ending, you feel something in your heart about Jamie Sullivan and start, feeling sorry for her, and begin to love the character more and more and more untli BAMMMM, you cry.  This is the only book that broke my heart, shattered it into pieces, and mended it back up in a snap.  I read this book for maybe two or three days.  I wanted to prolong the book so that I won't miss one word.  This is the only book that ever made me cry for hours, practically for days.  Cry Cry Cry and fall in love.  When you've found someone, you don't have to hid it, but do something about it before it's too late.  That's the lesson I've learned from the book, although, it's pretty hard to abide with.  You'll fall in love with this book, I promise.  Every teen, kid, adult, every senior citizen, non-Senior citizens, Philippinos, Chinese, Hispanic, French, Italian, Portuguese, Indian, whatever you are, should own this book.  It makes you laugh, go all tingly, and cry.  In the end, the crying just flooded my bedroom.  It was the best book.  I know I'm saying this gagillions of times, because I urge you to buy this book, and this book should win an award.  I cried and cried and cried through good times and bad.  You will learn valuable lessons from this book and go into the book to really experience what the characters and author are thinking deep inside.  It totally gives you the oppurtunity to dig deep inside of you and learn the lessons deep within.  This book is great, and I promise you'll love it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|...<br />So when Echoes first came I out, I was skeptical.  I mean, some of the songs I had were already there, so why should I get it?  But I eventually figured that I haven't heard ALL of the songs, so might as well try it out.<br />What I have to say is that this is a GREAT compilation.  It gives you a twist of ideas if you're an old Floyd fan, going from Shine on You Crazy Diamond to Time, etc.  I mean, it's like playing clips of a movie in your head, and Floyd albums are just that: music that lays movies in your mind.  And for newer fans like me, it's great that you hear the entire spectrum of Floyd over the years.<br />Some people may be upset by some of the songs.  All I have to say is STOP BASHING!!!  Especially Keep Talking.  It may not be a great song, but it's not terrible or aweful.  It's good, just not excellent.  Also, I doubt Gilmour is trying to remake the old Floyd; he knows that that time has gone, and now Pink Floyd is evolving.  <br />One other thing.  Someone said that they should make an album of out-takes.  In all honesty, I'm not sure how it would really do and if people would really like it, old or new fans.  Pink Floyd albums are supposed to be a story, and if you show how you made that story, the imagination dies away.  You won't enjoy it as much as if you're just hearing the final product.
B00005YW4H|2.0|this is a pleasant cd to listen to over a dinner or maybe on a sunday morning. but it doesn't do a whole lot for me in terms of making me feel something about the music or lyrics. <BR>i kept waiting for norah to stretch it out a bit. maybe kick in that voice a little more to give me something to get excited about. it never happened.<BR>she seems to have the ability/capacity to belt a little but i felt like she was holding back the whole cd.<BR>maybe she will get there. maybe she had bad advice from producers and recording execs. <BR>i also think she sounds like too many other female artists at certain times. there is nothing that sets her apart. <BR>give norah a listen and then follow it up with billie or eva cassidy. there is absolutely no comparison.<BR>it a solid cd, but the hype surrounding it is out of control.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I can not understand why some of these other reviews say this CD stinkz, and that they give it a star 2 or star 3 or star 1 or even 4. I'd give it a A-10, if I could. But that's not allowed here at Amazon :-( Awwe, ohh well! Jen has now 3 albums' they are, On the 6, J.LO, and J to tha .LO (Remixez!)! I've got only On The 6, and it's very good. Some of my fav songz are \\"If you had my love\\" , \\"waiting for tonite\\" , \\"no me ames\\" , and \\"Should've never\\"! I urge you ALL to buy this album today, K?
B0000636UN|2.0|What happened?  This is truly a 2-star (or less) record.  The \\"Rolling Stone\\" review really nails it when they say it sounds like \\"a Sheryl Crow cover band fronted by Bob Seger.\\"  In general, the record boasts a few solid tunes, but many of them (especially the ballads, such as \\"Safe and Sound\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\"--a cringe-inducing duet with cheesy Don Henly) are over-the-top in a way that hasn't really been apparent on her previous records.  To me, the best way to sum up the \\"sound\\" of this record is that she's going for a sort of mid-70's pop radio glammed-out Aerosmith kind of feel--and she succeeds at this.  Whether or not that's a desirable goal is another question.  I just don't \\"get\\" the direction she's taking here.  She still retains the artistic control she gained with her second record:  i.e. she produces again, and more songs are written by Crow alone than on any of her previous albums.  And yet, perplexingly, this is undoubtedly her slickest, most commercial-sounding disc yet (even more than the oft-maligned but actually excellent country/pop \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\").  The production is so glossy and seems aimed straight at adult contemporary radio, especially with the generic techno-lite beats unecessarily cluttering nearly every song on the record.  Crow has used samples and beats much more artfully in past songs like \\"Sweet Rosalyn\\" and \\"Riverwide.\\"  If she was going so hard for this \\"vintage '70's\\" kind of feel, why muddle the overall effect by throwing in these \\"modern\\" sound effects?           There are actually a few good songs on this record.  \\"Weather Channel,\\" featuring great-as-usual harmonies from Emmylou Harris, is a dark, hushed, middle-of-the-night beauty along the same lines as \\"Home\\" and \\"I Shall Believe\\" from her earlier albums.  If only she would make an entire album of these kind of songs!            Also, the title track (\\"C'Mon, C'Mon\\") is alright.  It's one of the few spots on this record where she rocks out without sounding self-conscious.  That's another aspect where the \\"Rolling Stone\\" review is dead-on:  Crow seems to be second-guessing her abilities on this record.  It's not really evident in the lyrics (which are fairly generic), but more in the calculated swagger of the music itself, which in the past was always her strong suit--simply through its pure, unpretentious rock 'n' roll.  On this record, the combined melodies and production almost make it sound as though she was writing looking over her shoulder at her studio bosses--trying to write a \\"hit\\" and beef up sales, etc.  Listening to this record, I'm hard-pressed to come up with another explanation.
B000002LVB|5.0|I find it very interesting that certain reviewers state that &quot;Loaded&quot; isn't good because it doesn't sound like the VU.  I guess these same people would have given &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; two stars because it didn't sound like the Beatles.  Groups grow and evolve.  That's what makes them good.  I read these same types of reviews for Wilco's wonderful CDs &quot;Being There&quot; and &quot;Summer Teeth&quot; (which, by the way, is heavily influenced by VU's &quot;Loaded&quot;).<br />This CD is full of wonderful songs (albeit somewhat over-produced).  From &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; to &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&quot; every song stands on its own as a classic.  Buy it and enjoy it.  In spite of (and because of) the fact that it doesn't sound like the previous VU efforts.
0783114222|5.0|I watched and taped this HBO series when it came out four years ago as I am very interested in the Apollo moon landing program.  I've read almost all of the books written by astronauts, flight directors and outside observers, like the one that was the basis for this series written by Andrew Chaikin.  The series is fantastic, especially in the DVD format, which really brings the sounds and pictures to life.<br />I have several favorite episodes in the twelve-part series.  The story about the catastrophic Apollo 1 fire, which killed three astronauts is extremely touching and well acted.  The Apollo 12 episode explores the friendship that is forged between three men who experience something very few people will ever get to do in their lifetimes.  That episode, which includes a fine performance by ER's Paul &quot;Rocket Romano&quot; McCrane, is extremely fun.  Alan Shepard's Apollo 14 flight episode also was enjoyable as well as the episode that chronicles the historic Apollo 11 moon landing.  This latter episode is great in that it does an excellent job of exhibiting the tension that took place between Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin about who would take the first steps on the moon.<br />There were only two episodes that I found to be less than average, including the story of the Apollo 13 flight.  I certainly understand that they would not want to rehash the events in an episode when there has been a terrific movie made about this ill-fated voyage.  But I thought that focusing the attention on a battle between an old school (the terrific Lane Smith) and a new school journalist (the annoying Jay Mohr) just wasn't interesting to me.  I also actually didn't care for the final episode which focused half on the Apollo 17 mission and half on the making of an old time movie about landing on the moon (with Tom Hanks in the lead role of a French director).  I find myself fast forwarding through these scenes when I watch this episode.<br />Overall, a terrific package that reallybrings the moon landing program to light.  A must!
B000002NZO|5.0|This album is worth buying just for The Knife and White Mountain. These are among Genesis's top five songs for sure. The rest of the songs are also very good but, as is the case with many progressive albums, you tend to like some parts of the song better than others. For example, the second half of Looking for Someone is much better than the first. Dusk is a nice quiet song too. I have read a lot of negative things about the drummer on this album, who preceded Phil Collins. I don't agree. I thought he did a very good job, especially on the Knife. The album, like most 70s prog rock, is heavy on keyboards and that is most definately a plus. Like most Genesis songs from the progressive era, the songs tell different stories. The best, of course, is the Knife, which is a war song, something we don't get very often these days.
0440234743|3.0|Sometimes I got tired of the jungle. I wanted to read more about the miserable lives of the Phelan clan (interesting name...felan...fallen) and about Andys life's turn-around.<br />The book spans a little over two months and in that you spend most of your time on the Paraguay River in a swamp called the Pantal. There's really no &quot;Girsham&quot; courtroom drama which is what I think most people expect from one of his novels. If it weren't for the jungle advanture, during which nothing really happens...well, some things happen but we move on quickly) this would be a pretty boring short-story.<br />Good weekend or vacation read, especially if you like South America.
0385501560|2.0|...<br />I didnt like the book \\"Choke\\" at all.  I thought the few  characters were degraded and I dont know why any normal person would want to go into the mind of a sex-adict.  I thought the characters were undeveloped and vague in my immagination due to the lack of description, as well as primitive in their attitude towards each other as well as sex.  If  you really read into it, Victor (main character) has a one track mind- sex, and ocasinoally his poor dying mother.....this book was just unenjoyable, unless of course, you would want to spend 200 pages of your time reading about a gutter minded 20 some odd year old kid who is going through all of the sexual desires that any normal human goes through, only he gives into them...I really cant belive this book even got published, what a gross reflection of American culture!
B0000542D2|5.0|Ok, ok, ok. I love this movie and I hear the extras will make it worth the wait, but enough is enough. Buena Vista or Martin Lewis need to hurry it up because I hear the grumbling and a riot is about to start.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I went into my room to watch this movie,  I was skeptical, because it was compared to \\"Final Destination\\", which I did not like at all.  Lets just say that I am glad I watched it.  The movie, stars the kid from \\"Bubble Boy\\"  who did an amazing acting job,  and with roles as diverse as \\"Donnie Darko\\" and \\"Bubble Boy\\"  I consider him an artist, and am happy that he hasnt been type cast into \\"stoner\\" comedy roles, because he did an amazing job.  Any way I digress,  the movie was stunning, not only visually, but conceptually.  It had a \\"david lynch\\" type feel to it, but easier to follow.  The imagery used in the movie was great, especially the bunny, and the \\"spears\\" from his chest.  And like any other \\"lynch\\" type movie you walk away thinking about how it all broke down in the end, wondering exactally what happened... Dont let the super-heroish title fool you, the movie is anything but super hero based film.
B00005OM4N|5.0|In her latest offering \\"Britney\\", Britney Spears again succeeds in delivering hard hitting vocal ballads centered on pre-twenties sexual idealism that massage the senses and result in some hardcore booty shakin'.  However, if satisfying the senses is not your thing, \\"Britney\\" offers plenty of metaphysical thrillers that get the intellect on krunk.  For example, on tracks like \\"Lonely\\" and \\"I'm not a girl, I'm not yet a woman\\", Britney Spears waxes philosophical and leaves her listeneres dizzy and frozen in an state of existentialst limbo.  As the album progresses, Britney begins to learn from her deep introspection and gradually begins to comprehed her state of being.  Finally, Britney feels the need to escape her underground world, and on the track \\"Let me be\\", she lashes out against the herd society that surronds her, inspiring listeners to grasp the subjective in the midst of the universal.  The album concludes with the track \\"What its like to be me\\", bringing the experience to a close and solidifying the totality that is Britney.  The first time I heard this song, I cried.  All in all, \\"Britney\\" serves as a fundamental album in any muscial collection.  Five Stars!!!!!!!!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Wow is really all you can say about this album. It is refreshing to hear such a culmination of catchy, danceable beats along with the rock and middle eastern undertones. This Latin \\"rocker chick\\" has definitely insured a place in the American music industry with this album. \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" combined latin rhythms with unique vocals, while maintaining a catchy, up-beat tempo. In addition, the rest of the album is more than listenable. Shakira's vocal talent is evident throughout the album, from the Arabian beats of \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" to the Tango rhythms of \\"Objection\\" to the unique melodies of both her spanish tracks on the album. Definitely a success, Laundry Service has something for every kind of music lover.
B00000DC7J|5.0|If you have to own just one Astor Piazzolla album, make it this one.  From start to finish, it is simply the best in all respects, particulary in how the entire album is so well-integrated.  Every selection fits together with every other seamlessly.<br />Some might argue that &quot;La Camorra&quot; is superior.  I think that album has moments where it exceeds &quot;Tango: Zero Hour&quot; but as a totally-integrated album, &quot;Tango: Zero Hour&quot; has to stand alone.  This album should appeal to anyone who loves well-made music, regardless of your normal musical preferences.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I never thought that this band could improve on its material from Kid A and Amnisiac, but they managed.  There are some truly amazing live renditions here like the title track. Above all, though, the piano version of Like Spinning Plates is truly transcendent. The last track (formely an unrecorded live track) is also amazing, Radiohead at their gut-wrenching best. The only problem with this disc is the fact that there's only one track that's not from one of the two above mentioned discs. As far as I know they don't have any (official) live CD's of previous work. Despite that, this is an essential disc to any Radiohead fan.
B000059QWJ|4.0|SFAM is Dream Theater's epic CD that combines all of their finest talents.  This concert catches just how well they can pull that off, and add some theatrics to a very theatrical work in a live setting.  I was simply AMAZED at how the band performed this very complex 70+ minutes of music, and very pleased at (most, not all) of the camerawork that caught it.  This is a Dream Theater's FAN tape, but to anyone unfamiliar, it definitely will seem strange, cheesy and lots of other bad adjectives.<br />But, that being said, this prog-rock fan who grew up with the bands that DT did (Yes, Genesis, etc) and some of the neo-prog bands of the 80's that creep in to their music now and then, still MUST say that DT's talent, ambition, and ability to write a great song put them in my top 10.  Getting back to the video, I must say that I was getting put off by some of the 'seventies' effects used after awhile (lots of psychedlic graphics, reverse imaging, etc) - I felt like I could have used some LSD or something to enhance the 'experience'.  However, DT's attempt to put the whole video together as a 'story' was great - kind of reminded my of the days when albums did tell a story, and that was OK (even 'cool').<br />This video does a great job of putting SFAM to a video - there are other DT videos out there that capture 'the band' better without the 'effects' used throughout.  ... I was disappointed that one of the best (if the not the best) 'sounding' bands today chose simple technology for the tape (and apparently, the DVD too), thus taking away from the total sound experience this should have been...we can only hope that the next DT video/DVD is different.  In the meantime, this is a video that can be enjoyed by all DT fans - but just don't expect more that what I have already mentioned!
B00005JKBC|1.0|If you buy or rent the Spy Game DVD, you may experience a problem with the captioning for the hearing impaired. Whether or not it happens on all players, or only on certain makes and models, you may not be able to turn off the captioning for this movie. Since the captioning is in a very large font, it is completely distracting and makes the movie nearly unwatchable. I tested this on two copies of the Pan &amp; Scan version, and one copy of the widescreen version on a Toshiba SD-1600. Like some other people, I have contacted Universal Marketing regarding this, and hopefully a re-release will be announced (or some other fix). If you want to own this DVD, I'd suggest renting it first to see if you experience the problem, or wait for a potential solution from the creators.
B00000F169|4.0|\\"Let there be light\\" -- and you will absolutely fall off your couch laughing. And you'll keep laughing till the film ends. It was just as great/funny as when I first saw it 20 years ago. Dark humor, and brilliant. A must-see for sci-fi fans. Plus, it's so short that even people who might get bored, or might not \\"get it,\\" should still find the time spent worth the laughs it will generate. Its [less costly](but amazing for the price) production values are its charm. This film would never work as well if it was a slick [costly] production...
B00005YW4H|5.0|I had the pleasure of witnessing this young lady live in concert at a local club on March 27 (#'s in Houston) and instantly fell in love with her gentle, breezy delivery and smoky, relaxed contralto. To see her live is to truly here these songs come to brilliant life! This debut merely hints at her potential and points the way for other young [people] to follow. This daughter of a legend (her dad is Ravi Shankar)has a truly bright future and the music world has a rich new gift in her presence! Don't miss this!
B0000636UN|5.0|As a huge Sheryl Crow fan, I, of course absolutely loved this cd.  I have always contested that she is the female Tom Petty, and if the rock gods are willing, this should become her \\"Full Moon Fever\\".  Crow hasn't had this much fun since \\"Tuesday Night Music Club.\\"  This is by far her peppiest and brightest cd.  It's probably not her best, but it could become her most commercially succesful.  Channeling the rock gods of the '70's, Crow belts out some good old fashioned rock anthems that may win over the younger generation.  There's a lot of potential radio hits here.  But die-hard Crow fans need not worry, although perkier than usual, Crow still delivers her trademark goods, quirky lyrics, great grooves, and lots of down and out and dark characters seemingly lost in a bizarre world where pop-rock, country, and blues meet.  The title track is especially good and catchy, and has become my personal favorite thus far.  \\"Diamond Road,\\" \\"It's Only Love,\\" \\"Abilene,\\" and \\"Weather Channel,\\" rank among her best and most heartfelt work ever.  The only non-winner on this cd is the duet with Don Henley, a perfect example of the kind of cliched-ridden souless pop-rock Crow always seems to be rallying against.  She collabrates with many others here, from Steve Nicks to Lenny Kravitz, and it all seems to work.  Maybe one day she will collaborate with Tom Petty.  On that day I could die a happy man.  Until then, I doubt \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" will leave my cd rotation.
B00005JKJA|1.0|If you ever want to feel like you're on a bad acid trip just rent this movie. The beginning seemed to have potential but totally fell apart by the end. Lynch couldn't pull off a somewhat satisfactory ending after two and half hours. Hang it up until you can put out something good ol'Davey, please!
B000002B7W|5.0|It's pretty hard to describe this album.  If you loved Randy Rhoads' work on the studio albums, prepare to be even more blown away then you already were.  He adds so much little stuff live, it sounds absolutely fantastic.  His solo in the middle of &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; is one of the best I've ever heard.  <br />When you think about how young he was, and how talented he was, and how succesful he was going to be, you will get sad.  At least I did.  In 2 years, he influenced so many guitar players to come, it's incredible.  Even in relatively simple songs, such as &quot;Paranoid&quot;, he manages to add an unbelievable solo that you never would have expected.  Every song from &quot;Blizzard&quot; is on here, and in my opinion, they all sound better.  &quot;Beleiver&quot; and &quot;Flying High Again&quot; also sound great.  This album doesn't have all the unnecessary bad language that Live &amp; Loud has, and is a better album anyway (although Live &amp; Loud is pretty good).  Randy's guitar work is just amazing, that's all I can say, you really have to hear it for yourself.  R.I.P. Randy, we love you.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Although this disc is not as good as Rage's previos albums it is still an exellent album. The guitars are great and the lyrics are amazing. The album could be improved by going back to their roots and singing songs more like their original album. They should have played songs that sounded more similar to \\" Killing in the Name\\" and \\"Settle for Nothing.\\" Still a good album though.
0792835077|4.0|I watched this as a kid in the 1970's when it was on television and I remember almost peeing in my pants...I was so scared!! Yul Brynner may have delighted tons of kids and adults in the 1950's with his &quot;King and I&quot; musical movie, but he scared the &quot;begeegee&quot; out of us kids of the 1970's, giving us nightmares of a bald robot cowboy chasing us endlessly in our dreams. He was that scary and menacing--I still remember his walk in the movie...and then the rapid almost-running stride as he comes closer to his prey--I look back as an adult and believe he should have gotten some kind of acting award.  Richard Benjamin was actually good in this movie (in spite of what some critics say). Yeah, there is a 70's look to it and some of the special effects are cheesy by today's standards, but sometimes, simple is better. I like this better than the overblown stuff of Terminator 2, etc. Watch it on a lazy afternoon and be prepared for a great suspenseful flick. If you're a kid, relive all the feelings you had as a youngster, but with the wisdom and maturity 25 years later and remember the good ol' days of Westworld, Logan's Run, Jaws, and all those mid-1970's movies.
6305603847|5.0|I am a huge Pink Floyd fan. When you watch The Wall you have to see it in it's psycodelic perspective. Basically you need to trip shrooms when you watch it or you need to be REALLY high. all the hippe stoners out there really know what Pink Floyd songs are about and what the wall was really intended for. The wall wasn't for critics to review it was made for all us stoners and hippies out there to trip on while we watch it. In my personal opion it is one of the worlds greatest trip movies on the earth
0553573403|5.0|I have been reading fantasy for over 10 years and this series is the best I have ever read.  If you are new to fantasy, or you are trying to recommend a book for a friend...this book is it.  Martin has a knack for mystery, the subplots leave you dazzled and wondering and the intensity of the book is relentless.  This is the kind of book you skip class to continue reading.  There is one Danger, it is better than Wheel of Time series, and Goodkinds epic.  Raymond Feists'and Janny Wurts &quot;Servant of the Empire&quot; have the intensity, but not the mystery.  Michelle West's books have the mystery, but no where near the depth (and I love her books) so this book might set your expectations really high.  You have been warned.
B0000560X0|5.0|I'll tell you from the start, this is Nothing But Class. George really delievers and the sound is GREAT. A pleasant surprise from Joe Sample and the music selection is very good.<BR>   HIS MUSIC REACHES YOU, and that's why you would want to get this DVD and have it in your collection. ALL CONCERTS SHOULD BE IN DTS.
B00005JCA9|4.0|Notting Hill is one of my favorite romantic comedies, right up there with Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seatle.  I've read that some people call this film &quot;preposterous&quot; or &quot;completely unbelievable&quot;.  In fact, I thought this movie very believable, centered around one realistic, if highly improbable, &quot;what if?&quot;  What if an ordinary fan courted and married a movie super-star?  <br />Hugh Grant plays an ordinary guy who has a chance meeting with international film star Julia Roberts (there was some other name for Roberts' character, but for all purposes, she is playing herself).  A simple hello and a spilt cup of OJ kick-starts Grants romance with this very mysterious person, sweeping him into the crazy movie-star-life of press junkets and gossip reporters.  The perfect film-image of Roberts is shattered with the reality that she is a very closed, cautious person with a sharp tongue.  And yet, as all perfect romance movies do, the hard shell is gradually peeled back to reveal a very loving person inside.  <br />I found the earthly Grant too be much more charming and interesting than the cold, distant Roberts, and I could associate with his character as he loved a person on a movie screen soo much that his heart broken.  This film is a great &quot;date movie&quot;, as it gives a lot to women without turning of men (there are some great jokes in there, just for the guys).
0380788624|1.0|I read a couple hundred pages of this 1000+ sleeper before putting it down. Why bother wasting more time? The characters are so weak I just didn't give a damn, and I wasn't interested in a crypto primer.<br />It's like the author wanted to show off how clever his math demonstrations were, then used a WW2 setting to trick you into reading, thinking this was all actually going somewhere.<br />I'll pass, thanks.
0812550706|5.0|Hands down, the best work of fiction I've ever read.
B00005JKBC|3.0|This is a good movie for a night when you want to be entertained, but don't want to have to think a lot.  This movie is predictable, but gives interesting insight into the strategies of being a spy.  The format of the movie is a present story-line with Robert Redford's character going back to memories of his meeting and training &quot;Boyscout&quot; (Brad Pitt's character).  Something that adds interest to this film is the fact that it takes place on the last day of work at the CIA for Redford's character.  I could take it or leave it.
0553573403|3.0|This is a well written work of Epic fantasy that I enjoyed very much.  I have yet to move on to the second and third installments, but I plan to.  I know some will complain about this and that, but overall I think its a tribute to the genre.
6303269869|5.0|This movie is very true to life about how a family can be broken apart, but there is hope to survive any addiction.  The main character, Alice, played by Meg Ryan has an addiction to alcohol that is slowly destroying herself and her family.  After a heart-wrenching incident with her oldest daughter she seeks help....but the road to recovery is a long one and her husband, wonderful played by Andy Garcia, must help in a way he does not know how.  They both must learn how to be a family again.  <br />This story is a real.  This is what really happens, with any addiction.  A person on the road to recovery is a different person and all people, including oneself need to understand that and realize that and live with that.  I hope that seeing this movie helps to put that point across, and there is hope.  It is a wonderful story of love and hope.
B000002MTU|5.0|This is arguably my very favorite blues recording and easily my favorite Clapton disc. If you're looking for something like 'Tears In Heaven', get a different Clapton disc. But if you ever wonder why the expression 'Clapton is God' expression ever came about, give this one a listen..
B00005QG9J|5.0|When I first heard of Incubus, it was from &quot;Stellar&quot; on the radio off of their album, Make Yourself. I fell in love. They grew more famous with the pop scene after releasing &quot;Drive&quot;, also off of Make Yourself. When they released the album, &quot;Morning View&quot;, I was first in line to buy it. I am happy to say this is one of Incubus's greatest works. It's definitely lighter sounding and more &quot;mature&quot; as lead singer Brandon Boyd puts it. Every track on this album is beautiful as beautiful as it is powerful. They have a selection of songs that display their new style such as the crisp sounding &quot;mexico&quot; and the melodic, fun &quot;Are You In&quot; and some songs bragging their old, heavier style such as &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase.&quot; This CD is for everyone, not just lovers of metal or rock. Teens who prefer bands such as LFO will enjoy this just as well. Brandon Boyd's beautiful and unique style of singing still doesn't fail to move fans to tears and Mike's genius with the guitar will have you listening to this album time after time. A MUST-HAVE for anyone who loves music!
630471291X|5.0|I love this freaking movie.  Jon Leguizamo does a picture perfect violator, and they picked a great spawn, whoever he is.  everything is just as i imagined and it's one of my favorite movies of all times.  it actually does the movie justice which you can't say about a lot of comic book movies.  say what you will, it kicks the [heck] out of x men, that movie [stunk].
B000002LGQ|4.0|This cd is definately the biggest surprise out of all of Madonna's releases. You really start to think that Madonna has honestly changed, and then you hear Act of Contrition, and all of your new feelings about her fly right out the window. It's very hard to describe the track, but I'll do my best without spoiling it. She starts out quietly praying and then all of a sudden loud guitars start blaring, the chorus of \\"Like A Prayer\\" is played in reverse, and Madonna's prayer is exposed for what it really is. All I can say is that I was laughing out load for a good 10 minutes after I heard it. It's not dirty, just funny. This track absolutely makes me love Like A Prayer. Very cool, Madonna.

B0000636UN|1.0|The aging, airbrushed Sheryl Crow is back with her once-every-two-years piece of product designed for Maximum Cash Flow.  'c'mon, c'mon', her 4th studio project since her days as being a Michael Jackson backup singer, is a 13 song collection of over-produced, bland, blurry, AOR-friendly, vaguely retro music that is designed to be played by that large portion of our population whose tastes never really advanced from the time they graduated college in 1979.<br />On the surface, at least, there is nothing that one could possibly take offense at with this music. Just like Tom Petty, or the Wallflowers, this is gutless roots rock music that has been whitewashed to the point of disco. It's safe, suburban, SUV music.<br />No fewer than 62 individual musicians are credited in the liner notes, but by the sound of things the only one who really needed to be credited was whoever was running Pro Tools and manipulated every sound to within an inch of its life. Despite Sheryl's persona as a good, old-fashioned, analog rocker chick, this is one of the slickest, most glossed productions you're likely to here.  This is music that sounds like it was designed by savvy Businessmen, not musicians.<br />Sheryl and her press corps would have us believe that this is some sun-baked tribute to the heady days of 1976, when the Eagles, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Steve Miller ruled the airwaves.  Yeah...you know just where you're going to stand with the album once you hear Sheryl paraphrase &quot;Freebird&quot; on her first song, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;.<br />What's happened here?  There was a time not long ago when Don Henley was rightly mocked, a black hole of uncool; he was spiritual father of Sting and the sworn enemy of rock and roll. Just when did the tide turn on the Eagles and their brethren?  What's happened to the world?<br />That Sheryl has invited him to duet with her on the unbearably dopey and pointless &quot;It's So Easy&quot; seems reasonable enough then, as long as you approach it with the idea that the world (or at least that part of it that cares about rock and roll) has gone utterly mad. Just as does the indulgent, useless inclusion of Stevie Nicks.  Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, is a little harder to justify.<br />Don't worry, though, just like those 62 musicians, you can't really distinguish anyone from anyone else.  It might as well be Ernest Borgnine backing up Crow for all that you can make out the humanity through the pancake-thick, macrame' production.<br />For a woman who complains that &quot;all our popstars look like porn&quot; Sheryl is showing an awful lot of flesh both in the CD insert and on her VH1 hit, the trite &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot;.  The pre-press on this album would have you believe that the whole album is made up of such breezy, bikini-wearing numbers, but after a few upbeat songs Sheryl gets all reflective and the ham-fisted production kicks into high gear with such lumbering, DOA monstrosities as &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.<br />Like the 1970's themselves, the interminable &quot;c'mon, c'mon&quot; finally ends with a giant bummer that feels like you're going to suffer a hangover from it for the next decade. &quot;Weather Channel&quot; is a morose, leaden, downbeat, hopeless song, that includes one of the creepiest, least-funny lines ever:  &quot;...I got lab coats/who will bring me a panacea&quot;.<br />Yuk. The only panacea for 'c'mon, c'mon' is to throw your stereo out the window in disgust.h it with the idea that the world (or at least that part of it that cares about rock and roll) has gone utterly mad.

B0000636UN|3.0|From Tuesday Night Music Club to Sheryl Crow to The Globe Sessions and now to C'mon C'mon, it's been a treat to watch Sheryl's style progress.  We are all familiar with the songs that first put Sheryl on the map, the carefree (are was it) \\"All I Wanna Do\\", the semi-autobiographical (to her denial) \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\".   TNMC was not nearly as complex or dark as her self-produced follow up, Sheryl Crow.  Sheryl Crow is a wonderful album on which Sheryl's lyrical sensibilities really start to shine.  You can  tell she had something to prove.  The Globe Sessions are simply a culmination of superb songwriting and magnificent musical delivery. It's a true popular music masterpiece.   C'mon C'mon contains tracks that could have been TNMC B-sides.  It seems a bit regressed in style.  All of the tracks, especially  \\"Steve McQueen\\" and \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" have a glossy pop veneer.  It's only after a few spins that a bit more depth comes through.  Some of the ballads sound a bit contrived, a bit too polished.  Some of the lyrics seem to be a bit lazy.  Sheryl has set the bar high for herself, to be sure, and these sometimes lazy lyrics are often better than many artist's best, but they're still lazy.  Overall, a good album when compared to Sheryl's past work and a great album in comparison to most of the music out there today.  It says a lot about an artist when the standard of her work's comparison is her own.
B00003CXC6|5.0|With great action and memorable characters, Akira Kurosawa's \\"RASHOMON\\" is perhaps the first and probably the best film ever to investigate the philosophy of truth and justice and the inherent conflict with our fallibly subjective attempts to be objective.  Is this the first film to fully embrace relativism?<br /><br />Certainly somewhat existential and post modern in its central conceit, this exceptionally absorbing drama still resonates with a timely and provocative tale of the illusive nature of so-called Truth.<br /><br />Through an ingenious use of camera and flashbacks, Kurosawa reveals the seemingly paradoxical complexities of human nature as four people -- all witnesses to one degree or another -- recount different versions of the story of a man's murder and the rape of his wife. Toshiro Mifune gives another commanding performance in this eloquent masterwork that secured his international stardom.<br /><br />With a restored image and sound, this classic revolutionized film language and introduced Japanese cinema to a global audience. Loaded with extras, including a video introduction by Robert Altman and a brilliant commentary by Japanese film historian Donald Richie. Excerpts are also included from \\"The World of Kazuo Miyagawa,\\" a documentary about Rashomon's incredible cinematographer.<br /><br />Even in the pantheon of our greatest filmmakers, Kurosawa stands apart as an intellectual and an artist.  His best films have a shimmering beauty and a visceral impact while also engaging the mind.  A rare feat.  This 1950 masterpiece is an essential element of any serious digital library.
0871137380|5.0|What can I say?  I first read Blackhawk Down when it came out years ago.  Right before I went to see the movie I reread it and was blown away even more than the first tims I read it.  It is a clear, consise story told for and by members of Task Force Ranger so that their story will not be forgotten.  It is told so vividly that it is hard to believe Bowden was not there with these guys, running through buildings, up and down those streets, dodging bullets coming from every direction.  This needs to be a standard in every histroy and military history class in the country.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Life is short and the time wasted watching bad movies leaves an especially dark hole in our time cards.  Here's a title on a contemporary moral theme and heroism under fire that, with extras, might be worth a second consideration.<br />Brad Pitt and Robert Redford, the generationally separated Hollywood pretty boy look-a-likes, star in the great looking, mostly entertaining espionage action adventure \\"SPY GAME\\" directed by Tony Scott, Ridley's talented brother.  The commentary by Scott is especially entertaining as he talks about the two leads' diverse acting styles.  It seems Redford locks in his character early on and Pitt is looser and much more open to improvisation.  This contrast in methods lent itself well and perhaps gave an additional edge to the story of captured agent Bishop's (Pitt) attempted rescue by his boss Muir (Redford) after an unauthorized, very personal and daring, mission goes south.<br />There's an eerie father and son frisson to the two leads that is almost an intentional subtext.  Weird but fascinating.  Beautifully filmed with a humongous cache of extras (over ten hours), this is an old fashioned, slickly made, thrill ride with a ticking clock.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is unbelieveable.  I can understand how some might say they don't like this kind of music, but the fact of the matter is is that Radiohead know exactly what they are doing.  First of all you must realize that these guys are fantastic musicians. They don't make cd's solely for the purpose of selling them and keeping so-called music fans happy.  They are true artists.  People who consider themselves true musicians love this because it is completely real in its' art.  <BR>Radiohead does not try to make verse, verse, chorus, verse, verse, chorus types of songs.  They take the listener on somewhat of a journey, challenging them to notice every minute detail and to hang on until the very end.  Listening very closely to this album leads to finding new, intricate things each and every time.  It improves upon every listen.  Most songs build up and build up to a huge crescendo, which always brings the song together.  In the end it's what brings this entire album together.  For the few of you out there who still appreciate true rock music for it's realness and creativity (not to mention the extreme listening pleasure), you will love this cd.

B00005ARDC|5.0|I would rank B.R.M.C. as one of the top 10 best new bands I've heard in the past decade. For those of you who felt completely disillusioned after the sad end of Morphine (who were my saviors after the end of the Cure and Psychedelic Furs era)  Black Rebel Motorcycle Club is for you. B.R.M.C.'s songs are  melodic, interesting and wonderfully dark: something that's hard to come by these days. This CD has been stuck in my CD player since I bought it and I believe it will stay there for a while.
B00005NNT1|4.0|I personally believe that all children must see this movie.  It's a classic fairy tale where a beautiful daughter (Snow White) has to ward off her jealous evil stepmother.  Eventually, Snow White has to escape through the forest to a little cottage where she meets the 7 Dwarfs, who let her stay with him.  Then, her stepmother finds her and tries to kill her by giving her a poisonous apple.  The only cure is a kiss from the handsome prince.  Will he come in time?  Duh!  This is a Disney movie!  Of course, he will!  And they will all live happily ever after.  Sure, it's predictable, but it's definitely still worth the time and money to see it.
B0000636UN|1.0|Sheryl Crow, in a desperate attempt to recapture her old fan base, hits the gym, dons a halter top, poses for nearly nude photos in a men's magazine, and releases the most flimsy CD of her fun but inconsequential career. Crow can't even perform these songs live--her incredibly lame appearance on \\"Late Night with Carson Daly\\" proved she can't even reach the notes on her own tunes (Crow sings flat live CONSTANTLY). Crow isn't much of an artist anymore, and she's desperately trying to cling on to her celebrity. What a shame...it's like watching your grandfather fall down a flight of stairs--you can't stop it, but you knew in your heart it was inevitable.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Why isn't this on DVD yet? \\"Meet Me In St. Louis\\" is a 1940s look back to a year in the life of the Smith Family of St. Louis, the year preceding the 1904 World's Fair. This movie is visually stunning. The Technicolor photography and the camera setups are amazing (the late-night candle distinguishing is all one shot), a testiment to the talent of Vincente Minnelli and his wonderful cast, particularly his soon-to-be wife Judy Garland, who was at her most beautiful and could transform any song into something magical.<br />Garland gives generously to her costar, Margaret O'Brien, a sort of Shirley Temple for the forties, who is nothing short of brilliant as the morbid youngest daughter Tootie, with the fascination for \\"dead\\" dolls. Her Halloween scene is remarkable and hilarious. The minimalist plot--Will Dad take the job in New York? Will Esther marry the boy next door, John Truitt? Will Rose wind up an old maid, like Katie?--never gets in the way of the lavish staging of the musical numbers. \\"The Trolley Song\\" is like a great music video, and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is still a standard. Great for the Holidays or any day, this movie is always sure to bring a smile. Watch for a very young June Lockhart (\\"Timmy and Lassie\\", \\"Lost in Space\\")as Lucille Ballard, the much-maligned New York socialite.
B000005IRG|5.0|Marquee Moon is one of the great albums of the 70's from the overlooked band Television. Born out of the mid 70's New York rock scene that produced the Ramones, Talking Heads, Blondie and others, the band was led by guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd.  The band's sound was different from the others thanks in part to superb guitar interplay between Mr. Verlaine &amp; Mr. Lloyd, but also they didn't pump out quick 3 minute songs, but had a jazzy edge.  The title cut and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; are both lengthy numbers (close to 10 minutes each) and show off the band's sharp musicianship.  Mr. Verlaine is a sharp lyricist and his songs has a wry sense of humor.  &quot;Venus&quot; is probably the best track on the album and contains a classic line &quot;fell into the arms of Venus DeMilo&quot;.  Television never gained the mass appeal of Blondie or the Heads or icon status of the Ramones, but Marquee Moon is better than any album to come out from that music scene and deserves to be heard by a wider audience.
015626224X|4.0|Orwell's foray into two separate worlds of utter poverty is definitely fascinating. In Paris, he writes clearly of restaurant scutwork and the lives that are wasted in such brutal conditions. The pettiness and sweat that comprise the days are remarkable for their constancy, and Orwell does an excellent job conveying the mind-numbing exhaustion that accompanies 18-hour days. Alternating such long days with periods of job searches, this section provides a still-relevant look at those who live a single paycheck from homelessness.  <BR>London has a different pace, as Orwell spends a month tramping about while waiting for a job to come through. His happiness at being back in England is obvious, and regular comments about the friendliness and pure spirit of the English people get a little repetitive, but he uses those feelings to make an important point. Closing the chapter is a short address that speaks of poverty and English laws that made it extremely difficult to establish any sort of regular life; he brings the still-present plight of the homeless into sharp relief. His points about certain institutions \\"stinking of charity\\" are fantastic food for thought for anyone employed in the social services. <BR>With such insight into poverty, his casual rascism is jolting. Easy and frequent references to Jews, Irish, Russians, and pretty much everyone who isn't a native Englishman are abysmally in key with the times the book was written, and it gets tiresome. Ultimately, it is disappointing that a writer can be so passionate about overthrowing the stereotype of the \\"tramp monster\\", and yet so thoughtlessly perpetuate the idea that all Jews have large noses, wiry black hair, and cheat everyone they have dealings with. These attitudes will lessen the overall value of this work for some readers, but there is still much to gain from giving it a  try.
068485743X|5.0|I bought this book to help me figure out how I can stop getting rejected so often. I wish I would have read it before I started writing.<br />As clear and concise as Strunk &amp; White, this little book is an important addition to any writer's toolbox. It covers all the bases on how to make bad writing good, and good writing great.<br />If I had a complaint, it would be that the examples of what not to do are so horribly written. Then again, they get the point across without a lot of time-consuming study!
B00005YU1O|4.0|Waking Life is the kind of movie that you will see and then spend days afterwards contemplating what you have seen and heard.  Not only is it a visual masterpiece, but the dialogue is incredibly deep and thought provoking.  At first it was all a little too much to take in at once, with the crazy animation and the abundance of philisophical debate, but after about 30 minutes I really started to get into it.  I can't wait to get the DVD so I can listen to the discussions all over again.  This is truly a unique film in the best sense of the word.  I highly recommend it.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Personally I love HORROR movies and I was surprised that I didn't hear about this movie earlier although it was extremely scary! You just can't take a breath for full 1.5 hours. To me the best part was the first half an hour. It was well made. The car scenes, truck scene and the pipe adventure was SUPERB.<br />The weak points I found were:<BR>1.  It is a monster movie which I find difficult to swallow, I prefer serial killers characters!<BR>2. There were few mistakes that the director overlooked such as:<BR>a) Trish (Gina Philips) being able to run after the monster kidnapped her brother at the end of the movie although the Police station doors were electrically locked.<BR>b) The policemen not shooting the monster's wings (before he flys with Trish) at the end of the movie although they had more than enough time to do so.<BR>c) The dead bodies in the Church basement were so obviously fake.<BR>d) Darry (Justin Long) body & face at the end of the movie was so obviously fake.<BR>3. In the DVD bonuses (the making of the movie) I didn't like the comments & big ego of the director (Victor Salva). I found his claim that he can do better than the movies \\"The Sixth Sense\\" & \\"Blair Witch Project\\", very much offending.<br />But in the end, this movie was successful enough to scare me! And I'll look forward for part 2.
B000060P79|1.0|Oh gee, this is so original.  Let's write some songs about loneliness and depression and try to sound important and accessible to ...[TV].

B0000636UN|4.0|Anytime an artist takes an extended break between albums, it either results in their getting distracted by inner turmoil and/or losing touch with reality and taking a nose dive creatively, or an artist honing their craft and coming back with great material. <br />Safe to say the latter is true with this one. True, I was beginning to be skeptical after reading Amazon's comments and Rolling Stones ripping of Sheryl's latest project.<br />NOT TRUE. Rather than going in with a preconceived idea of what one wants it to be - accept the music for the positive changes it brings.<br />This is the freshest, liveliest material since the debut. This one's got a deliberate 70's care free spirited up tempo vibe about it. Outside of the last track, the grim \\"Weather Channel\\" every song is up beat and has a certain groove going. I'm not the biggest Sheryl fan in the world - I really dig her uptempo material, but some of the drier tunes were just not me. <br />The projects opening track \\"Steve McQueen\\" reminds the ear of \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" except taken up a notch. Good up tempo free flowing tune.<BR>\\"Soak Up the Sun\\" is among the best tunes Sheryl's ever done - just a cool groove about it. The last words of the tune... \\"Got my 45 on, so I can rock on...\\" then followed by an opening jam of \\"Your An Original\\" is very cool.<BR>\\"Safe and Sound\\" allows Sheryl to expand the vocal chords in the sweet manner that she pulls off with the best of them.<BR>\\"It's So Easy\\" with Don Henley, admittedly builds high expectations and could have delivered better - but still enjoyable nonetheless.<BR>\\"Lucky Kid\\" and \\"Hole in My Pocket\\" rock out quite nicely.<br />Hats off to any artist whose willing to take some creative risk and not stick with a predictable approach album to album. This one continues to show why she is a multiple grammy winner, not to mention an excellent producer, writer, singer, and performer. To other Sheryl fans - serious or moderate: this one's worth the money.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I predict that \\"Spider man\\" will be this summer's big hits!!! The trailers are mindblowing and will be making bank at the box office!!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This film couldn't decide whether it was high camp or just second rate imitation of a number of good movies.  It was derivative beginning with Cabaret (one of the best movies ever made).  The music was utterly unoriginal and obviously the person who put the score together thought that the film was going to be set in 1999  not 1899. Frankly I couldn't watch it all the way to the ... end, it became far too painful to handle ....
0345448898|4.0|Lord Asriel has passed through to another world, with the intention of finishing a conflict that had been unsuccessfully fought before. This time, the good guys might win because of his passion and determination. But he is without a decisive weapon, which mustn't fall into the hands of the enemy.<br />Lyra has followed Lord Asriel and encounters a boy called Will, who has found a way, by chance, into this new world from a world almost the same as her home-world. She has the Alethiometer, and Will - by virtue of further happenstance - becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife. The Subtle Knife is the decisive weapon that Lord Asriel requires to determine a victory, and it is up to Lyra and Will to deliver it to him.<br />And Lyra is important, too.<br />The Subtle Knife was a more agreeable read than The Golden Compass / Northern lights. This was mostly due to the longer sections that gave the various characters and associated events pages, instead of a couple of lines or a short paragraph to play out, in relation to the unfolding plot. Even so, Philip Pullman's use of mixed viewpoint in multi-character scenes is a distraction that robs the story of useful energy and quality of character association.<br />The endorsements compare Philip Pullman to J R R Tolkien, proclaiming him to be his successor in the pantheon of greatness. In terms of the story this isn't really an issue for debate, but Tolkien's  more skilful writing, with respect to maintenance of viewpoint, means that Philip Pullman has a little way to go. This subtle and decisive weapon should be less difficult to obtain.<br />Next up...  The Amber Spyglass.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This Cd really is amazing(for the most part).  All of the tracks are the kind that you can really get into; however, I am alittle dissapointed in the amount of pop radio aimed content.  This CD is deffinatley on my top ten list but isn't quite number one because of this.  Everyone shold own a copy ,though, but I relly feel like the guys in the band sold out a little.
B0000636UN|5.0|Well, Sheryl Crow has done it again... this is a great CD. I picked it up on Tuesday when it came out and I can't get enough of it. Songs 1-4 are my favorite stretch of the CD, but the whole thing is good. What I admire about Crow is her ability to not only sing the songs, but write such great lyrics and be able to play her own music. To me, that is very impressive. Take for instance this line in her first single Soak Up The Sun: &quot;It's not getting what you want, but wanting what you got.&quot; Brilliant. There is also a lot of guest vocals on the CD. (Stevie Knicks, Natalie Maines, Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair and Gwynneth Paltrow.) All in all, this is a great CD that will surely enhance your collection.
B00005IC2H|2.0|I bought this CD after hearing track 2 and samples of the remaining tracks.  It's beautiful at times, but at others it's downright annoying.  They often use a looped cymbal that is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  The production seems unbalanced, with songs often sounding not properly mixed. Their use of horns tends to distract from their sound, and the vocals seem removed from the music.  I was very dissappointed in this CD and will probably give it away.  Look elsewhere for ethereal music.

B00005JKJA|4.0|Have anyone of you ever dreamed about people in your lives but those people seem to have taken on different roles during your dreams? This, I think, is what happened in Mulholland Drive. The movie makes a lot of sense if you try to connect all the points starting from the end to the beginning which is a dream sequence.<BR>Diane is an actress trying to score big roles in Hollywood. She's in love with Camilla Rhodes who has gotten a lead role in director Adam's movie. Camilla has broken up with Diane to marry Adam. Heartbroken and filled with jeolousy, Diane wants to have Camilla killed and hires a killer to do the job.<BR>This brings us to the beginning of the movie which I interprets as a dream of Diane that is very skewed on reality, but aren't all dreams like that? In the opening sequence, Rita/Camilla is nearly murdered (what Diane wants) but managed to escape with only a head wound that causes amnesia. She wondered into the life of Betty/Diane (bec. even in dreams, Diane wants to be with her). <BR>We also see how the professional life of director Adam is wrecked and is forced to hire Camilla Rhodes as his new lead actress. This, I think, is what Diane wanted Adam's real life to be as punishment for stealing her Camilla. Adam is forced to hire only Camilla Rhodes bec. that is exactly what happened to him in real life -- Camilla Rhodes is Adam's new lead. However, the Camilla Rhodes in Diane's dream resembled Diane bec. Diane has hoped to be the new lead.<BR>Diane also dreamed about the man whom she hires to murder Camilla. In her dream, she dreamed of the man knocking off a few anoymous people in an old building. As for the monster in the alleyway of Winkie's, that is what Diane has become -- a monster after she arranged to kill Camilla. This was in the last scene of the movie when Diane's face and the monster's merged as one.<BR>This is my interpretation of the movie.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This is brutal and deadly.  Converge have created a complete, devestating hardcore masterpiece.  Brutal doesn't do this CD (or the band) justice.  Just take whatever the heaviest music you've ever heard, make the band 10 times better, 10 times louder, and the lead singer one of the best vocalists in hardcore (ever, I think), and you'll have Converge.  That is assuming that the band you were thinking of had thick, chugging riffs and some of the sweetest drumming I've heard in a long while.  The layout and production are top-notch as well.  All together, this is a ground breaking, skull shattering hardcore release.  One of the best of the past five years I think.  Pick this up and experience a truly brutal beat-down.  This will leave you breathless after the first listen if you've never heard Converge before, and if you're a long time fan, you've probably got this all ready.  But if you don't, you need to get it, because this is Converge at their best.
6300275213|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 7 or 8 years old ( I was BORN the year the movie came out! ). I was a big fan of the little mermaid ( as just about every girl that age was )so when looking for videos with my mother one day, she suggested that I pick this one out to see. Well...The rest is history.<br />Splash as all the elements of a great romantic comedy. It's more of a Romance really than comedy though but it does have it's funny moments. It's about a sucessful businessman from NYC who seems to care more about his career than he does his girlfriend; who subsequently dumps him. Despite his disappointment, Allen ( Toma Hanks ) isn't too heartbroken. Afterall, he didn't love her and THAT'S what bothers him because he knows that she was everything he wanted in a woman so he figures that if he couldn't love her then it must be simply impossible for him to ever fall in love. Obviously, we know that isn't going to be the case. So, after getting drunk with his flamboyant older brother, Freddie ( Played by the late, great, John Candy ) he decides to take a cab all the way to Cape Cod because he \\"...feels closer to something there.\\" What happens is that he is dropped off at the wrong part of the island, is brought over by a man who owns a small boat, and ends up starnded on that boat and falls into the water ( AND he can't even swim )and is rescued by a beautiful mermaid, Madison ( Daryl Hannah ) with whom he falls madly in love with, unbeknownst of her true identity since she has legs out of the water.<br />Some critics have said that this movie is a little far-fetched but let me remind you of the obvious...SHE'S A MERMAID!!! This is obviously a fantasy ( Madison learns the entire English language from just watching TV for an afternoon ). Once you have realized that and don't take everything so literally, you will either love or hate this movie. but you'll only hate it if you truly hate romantic movies, I promise you. It's so sweet and tender and all roles are justperfectly portrayed. The story is well done, the acting is great, the actors are great and I cannot praise this movie enough ( except maybe that I wish it were longer or perhaps go on forever ) Another thing that you may be thinking is that since touchstone films is a division of Disney, \\"Is this movie more of a kids movie?\\" I guarentee you it's not. It can be a family movie ( It's rated PG ) but it has a very grown up plot and though it may be labeled as a romantic-comedy, it's not too overly silly that it takes away from the romance aspect of the film which make it come off seeming ridiculous like with similar fantasy related films like \\"Mannequin\\" and \\"Date with an angel\\" ( Okay, okay. I admit it, I love romantic movies that have a fantasy twist to them and those movies I DID like, but they just seemed really really silly and irritating at times ).<br />This would have to be my favorite movie. I love this movie soo much that I can quote almost the entire film word for word, ( If you don't believe me then email me and I'll shock you ) and now, at the age of 18, I still watch this movie at least 4 times a month if not more. I've watched it so much that I have to buy a new tape because the tape is actually quite run down and ragged now. And one more thing...If you're not a big fan of Tom Hanks, ( I really don't like any of his other movies and I HATED Forrest Gump and all the other \\"criticly acclaimed\\" films he's made. )Don't let this derail you from wanting to see this movie because Tom fits the part perfectly and to me, he isn't Tom Hanks. He's Allen Bauer; produce supplier. So if I haven't convinced you yet to watch this movie ( or watch it again! )...then I guess that there is no hope for you and you're missing out on a truly magical, highly romantic movie. I recommend this to everyone who loves romantic comedies
B00005OAIE|5.0|Most only know John Mayer for his radio single &quot;No Such Thing.&quot; The rest of &quot;Room for Squares,&quot; however, proves that John Mayer is one of the best singer-songwriters out there. I've seen him in concert and I have to say that his live shows are even better than the CD. No wonder Rolling Stone Magazine named him as one of the Top 10 artists to watch for 2002. He's awesome!! (and not bad to look at either!!) I definitely recommend this CD to anyone that is looking for some good music! &quot;Room for Squares&quot; has got me hooked onto John Mayer and I can't wait for him to come back to my town so I can see him again!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Probably the best album since No Doubt debuted in 1992, Rock Steady promises a mix of pop, regae, dance, and rock for everyone to enjoy. &quot;Hella Good,&quot; the second single off the album, as well as the second track, is my favorite song on the album. Although No Doubt might've slightly left the ska vibe behind on Tragic Kingdom, and sprinkled magical ska dust on a few songs on Return of Saturn, Rock Steady shows that No Doubt can change their style with each CD and still prove successful. I've read many bad reviews for this CD as well as others, and I highly disagree with all of them. No matter how their style changes, it's always good because they make it good. I can't wait to see what new music No Doubt is ready to show us on their next CD. Buy this! It's great! NO DOUBT ROCKS STEADY!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a wonderful computer animated movie about an ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), who wants to live in his swamp in peace. When the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) captures all of the fairy tale creatures (including the gingerbread man and the seven dwarfs), Shrek demands answers. Faraquaad agrees to get rid of them if he rescues Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in a far away castle for him. So off Shrek goes with his sidekick, a wisecracking, talkative donkey (Eddie Murphy) on his adventures to rescue the princess. <BR> <BR>This movie isn't just a kid's movie, like the PG rating suggests. The plot of this movie is good, the graphics are astonishing, and the humor of the movie is hilarious! I strongly recommend this movie to anybody willing to have a few good laughs.
0446677450|1.0|Where to start? I got this book from the library and returned it after reading about 50 pages. The style never caught on with me. He offers nothing concrete in terms of advice. I have also seen this advertised on late night infomercials. Better books I would recommend are:<br />How To Get Out of Debt,Stay Out of Debt, and Live Prosperously  By Jerrold Mundis<br />Your Money or Your Life By Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin<br />The Unofficial Guide To Beating Debt by Greg Pahl<br />The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J Stanely and William D. Danko<br />These books have more concrete suggestions in them. They are BS free (unlike Rich Dad.....). They will help you. This book will only make someone else rich. Don't buy this. Instead, buy any of the above books--or any other sound financial book out there.<br />P.S. Also can recommend any book by The Motley Fool (aka Tom and Dave Gardner).
B000063UR2|5.0|Okay, I have to set a previous review straight by emphasizing that the Tangerine Dream score wat NOT the original score, but that the Jerry Goldsmith score was the original, and any research on the reviewer's part would have shown this.  Unforutately, the American release of the film cut Jerry Goldsmith's score for Tangerine Dream, along with numerous other cuts to the film to trim it's length.  I think the majority of people who love this movie are excited to see it's re-release on DVD with the original score and director's cut.  If you personaly think that Tangerine Dream had the better score, fine, the disc being released in May will have both versions....but get your facts straight before entering a misleading review.
0783222149|5.0|This is a great movie which has one of my favorite actors in it. Joseph Mazzello plays Roarke, the son of Gail(Meryl Streep) who is a white water river rafting guide. They take a ride down a river with Roarke's father, Tom, played by David Strathairn. They have a fun time at the start of the trip, but when two fellows (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) ask for help riding down the river, things start to become odd.<br />This is an excellent movie with great acting by Joseph Mazzello, Meryl Streep, and Kevin Bacon. I highly recommend it. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you just beg that the family will make it out okay. I give it 5 stars.
B0000509C3|1.0|I recently read a review by hucklecat03 on this movie. I have to say it made me laugh when he says that \\"you'll be more entertained by eating corn that watching Children of the Corn\\". It made me laugh because he is SO RIGHT. This movie is not scary and it's not good. As a fan of Stephen King I have to say I was extremely disappointed at this laughable attempt for a frightfest. I'm just wondering how a bunch of young punks can take over a whole town. I just thought the movie was stupid, plain and simple. don't waste your time, effort or money watching this movie. This movie is actually horror if you put the two words together that make the word horrible. It's HORROR BULL.
B00004W56S|4.0|During the period between 1978 and 1980, Genesis subtly changed their sound.  While Genesis' 1980 release, Duke, maintained some of their progressive rock origins, it opened up a new, more commercial direction for the band.  Mike Rutherford's first solo effort, Smallcreep's Day, along with Tony Bank's first release, A Curious Feeling, bridges the gap between these two Genesis releases.<br />Often overlooked, Smallcreep's Day is an excellent effort.  One piece of information frequently forgotten is that the first half of the album is a wonderfully executed 25-minute long suite.  Other songs on the album are more commercial but Rutherford takes full advantage of the opportunity to showcase his songwriting skills - many forget that Rutherford wrote some of the better Genesis songs.  <br />Rutherford's bass and guitar work are excellent.  Simon Phillips' percussion skills add a very Genesis-like feel to the drum work.  Former Genesis band-mate Anthony Phillips joins on keyboards, adding to the atmospheric feel of the album and vocalist Noel McCalla adds a Paul Carrack-like bluesy feel to the overall picture.<br />The only real downside to the album is the production quality.  Too often the whole thing seems muted.  The percussion work is not crisp and vibrant and the vocals are often muted in the mix.  The keyboard work itself is well done but too often the important parts seem buried.  The bass often sounds flat and the guitars don't have much punch.  <br />Overall, this is an important piece of music for Genesis fans but, perhaps more importantly, it's a good album from a talented songwriter.
0780628551|5.0|This movie was Excellent! A must for any Charlize Theron Fan!  If you're worried about the negative reviews - I suggest buying used, the price is right and you will get an awesome movie!
6305508550|4.0|If you've ever worked in an office setting, you've gotta see this movie.  It follows Peter, a bored software engineer, as he deals with corporate downsizing, self-important management and bonehead corporate consultants.  Although this movie is set at a software company in Texas, it could have easily been set in any state in most any office.<br />I actually saw this movie in the theater when I was still in college.  I thought it was funny, but I couldn't fully appreciate the office humor.  That's what makes this movie so funny.  It's not the great American movie, it's not deep and it's not trying to be anything it's not.  It's just a very funny and smart look at common situations and charactatures of people we all seem to have in our workplaces.  I think everyone's gotten to the point where we just don't want to go back to work the next day, and we just don't care enough to tell the boss that we're not showing up anymore.<br />You definitely won't catch everything the first time you see this movie.  You won't catch all of Milton's (played by the same guy who was the station owner on NBC's News Radio) mumblings about his Swingline stapler and about the squirrels he used to watch outside his window.  One of the corporate consultants is played by the same guy who plays Dr. Cox on NBC's Scrubs, and he has some of my favorite lines as he interviews Peter's friend, Michael Bolton (no need to say more!).  Jennifer Aniston has a minor role, and she simply comes across as a ditzy waitress.<br />The downside to the DVD is it is simpler than the movie.  There's really no extras other than a trailer.  It would have been great to have had some outtakes, because you can really tell that these actors had fun making this movie.

1573222038|5.0|Sarah Waters's third offering, Fingersmith, is one of those books that manages to sustain its pacing and interest throughout, despite any number of Dickensian twists and turns in the truly byzantine plot. The tone is dark and melancholy (although lighter than Affinity's), but there's always a glimmer of hope to keep you reading. Waters's pacing, setting, and characterization are among the most remarkable I've encountered.<br />The one thing that bothers me most about Waters's books is the public's and critics' tendency to lump them in with \\"lesbian fiction.\\" What the heck is that? I'm not a lesbian, and I still find her books thoroughly engaging, interesting, riveting, and, frankly, fantastic. I'll read anything she writes, no matter what the sexuality of the characters....Highly recommended.

068485743X|1.0|This book doesn't offer specifics on the finer distinctions that agents make when considering the rejection pile. It uses examples of horrible writing. As an aspiring writer, I would have rather seen work that was pretty good, but didn't make it because . . .<br />And then the author (agent) could have provided specific constructive suggestions and techniques for writers to use to improve their craft. <br />I didn't get much out of this book.

B000002G87|5.0|What a one-shot group, Derek and the Dominoes!  A sensational double album clearly having no redundancy or filler.  More known for the teaming up of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman on the title cut's fabulous guitar work, Layla also benefits from the worthy contributions of Jim Gordon and Bobby Whitlock on keyboards and elsewhere and Duane's presence on most other songs.<br />The title track is one of rock's classic long, or any, songs.  It is in the vein of passion and beauty rather than R&B--\\"Light My Fire\\" rather than \\"Brown Sugar,\\" but while the former is otherworldly, \\"Layla\\" is the best of this world.  Like The Doors' magnum opus, it has a terrific keyboard solo (Gordon) and great guitar soloing, tho in reverse order; the screeching slide guitar enraptures in advance of Gordon's majestic piano.  Interestingly (and in reverse of the White Album), George Harrison appears on the credits.  He was the husband of Patti Boyd, to whom the song was dedicated and who moved over to Eric's affections.<br />\\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\\" is another highlight, and my second favorite.  Again, Eric's passionate singing and soloing are characteristic of a recording that emphasizes beauty over the hard edges, but this song still is hard-driving and hints at the blues.  Of course, with Eric, you can always expect no dearth of the blues, and this masterwork is no exception.  The best moment is Eric's and Duane's jam on \\"Key To The Highway,\\" whose moderate tempo allows you to absorb the fluid blues licks.  The other best songs are the sweet and sentimental \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" and a terrific rendition of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing.\\"  For good rhythm guitar blasts, check out \\"Anyday.\\"<br />Think about those performers you like whose songs have relatively simple structures but are great--\\"Be My Baby\\" will always be one of my favorites. But then you have a know-it-all friend who says \\"musically, it isn't that good.\\"  Who cares, your favorite is always better than his expansive junk.But then, cite Layla--it will be musically better than his junk or almost anything, and an absolute top notch group of songs to boot.  What an accomplishment by this talented ensemble--oh, yes, Carl Radle (percussion and bass) is the one I did not yet mention.  Moreover, the melodic strength and great structures of this superb collection of tunes have broad appeal, regardless of someone's genre focus.  Actually, anyone who does not like Layla should have his or her head examined.

B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington's chilling portrayal of Alonzo Harris, a corrupt, murderous narcotics Cop, dominates this gripping crime drama. Ethan Hawke stars as Jake Hoyt, a rookie \\"auditioning\\" for a spot with Harris' squad. Before his\\"Training Day\\" is over, Jake will fall into a vortex of corruption, murder, and betrayal, and see his belief in the system turned upside-down.<br />  Washington does his usual great job; You'll spend the entire film hating him, but being drawn in by his charisma at the same time. Hawke delivers an equally solid, if less flashy, performance, and holds his own with Washington. Great casting all around; Supporting players Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Scott Glenn also add a lot to the film. Director Antoine Fuqua keeps the film moving at a breakneck pace, and the ending is phenomenal.<br />  The extras on the DVD include the HBO \\"Making Of\\" Documentary, deleted scenes (All of which would have added a lot to the film), 2 music videos, and an alternate ending, which answered a question I had about the film when I saw it in it's theatrical release.<br />   Overall, an exceptional film.
B0000630BT|4.0|I was very disappointed in this album when it first came out.  Priest had remained one of my favorites, but I suppose I was looking for them to bust out and become a really big name with huge radio hits, which they had attempted and failed with \\"Turbo\\" (considered by many to be their worst album, but one of my favs by far). ... <br />It has since become one of my favorites. If you can completely tune out the cartoonish lyrics and song titles, it is a great slab of metal, an excellent recapturing of the band's past glories, and an appropriate swan song to the Rob Halford era . It is not without its duds, in fact I think the lead-off single \\"Painkiller\\" has a pretty weak chorus after building up with great drums and guitars. \\"Metal Meltdown\\" is only marginally better, don't know why that one was selected for \\"Metal Works '73-'93\\". Everything else sounds great, Halford's voice is pristine as always, and the production by newcomer Chris Tsangarides adds a new dimension after so many years with Tom Allom at the board.<br />Recommended cuts -\\"A Touch of Evil\\" (basically a reworking of \\"Night Comes Down\\" from \\"Defenders\\"), \\"One Shot At Glory\\", \\"Between The Hammer & The Anvil\\", \\"All Guns Blazing\\", and \\"Hell Patrol\\".  As for the bonus tracks, \\"Living Bad Dreams\\" is a typical brooding Priest ballad that's too good a song to have been left lying in a vault all these years.  The live version of \\"Leather Rebel\\" is excellent, and makes you wonder why more live tracks from the \\"Painkiller\\" album weren't released on the remasters instead of darn near every song from \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and \\"Defenders of the Faith\\".
B00004Z1MN|3.0|Enjoy &quot;Frequency&quot; as it is! You may be confused seeing at the frequent hapnnings across time, which were changed by Little Chief, John. He did it for the sake of saving his parents' lives. Wouldn't be fantastic to share time and feeling with loved one? John could do it. As the result, his whole life was completely different from his previous life. So, what does this mean to him? Where has his former life gone? ...Don't worry! This movie is more meaningful than a such reasonable question. &quot;Frequency&quot; is a thrilling, touching, and persuadable family movie. You might want to play baseball with your son.
B000002JS6|5.0|The death of Bon Scott is a terrible tragedy in the history of rock and roll. This album was the debut of new AC/DC singer Brian Johnson. He did a really good job on this album. The guitars, bass, and drums here are also done very well. Though there was no singer like Bon, AC/DC continued to be great after his passing. All of the songs here are filled with talent and emotion. My favorites are \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Back in Black\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", and \\"Shoot to Thrill\\". This masterpiece of a CD should be in the collection of every metal fan. We miss ya Bon!
B0000636UN|5.0|C'mon C'mon is fantastic!  If your a longtime Sheryl fan, or you just like Soak Up The Sun, you'll love this CD.  Steve McQueen and Hole in My Pocket are great fun rockers. Over You and Abeliene are more guitar laden and a little less forceful.  Lucky Kid is just terrific.  And Weather Channel is haunting in it's beauty.  I'm not exactly thrilled by It's so easy, but If you like Don Henley, it's the song for you.  And It's Only Love is a great new take on a wonderful song.  This is a must buy record, hands down.
B000005HLV|5.0|I bought this CD and listened to the whole thing in its entirity as soon as i got home. The whole CD is an amazing piece of metal work, way ahead of its time when it was released. Euronymous was an excellent guitarist, one of the best in black metal. After listening to this, im sorry hes gone. The guitar playing is very fluent but also has a hard edge to it. Hellhammer's drumming is very fast and never misses a beat. Atilla's vocal ability is amazing, its like he can sing and growl at the same time. My favorite songs on this one are &quot;Life Eternal&quot; and &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;. Give it a listen, you just might be surprised at how great it is. Now i want to get &quot;Live in Leipzig&quot; so i can hear what Dead sounded like.

B00005UQD5|4.0|I worked at Danvers State Hospital.  Although this gothic old building was once beautiful, the dark corners, subterranean tunnels, and lost souls were legendary.<br />This film effectively &quot;unearthed&quot; all my disturbing memories and creepy feelings.  Well done!
B00003CXRM|5.0|You definitely must get the DVD. Here's why:<br />In addition to the movie (which will never lose its luster in DVD format), it has several \\"side\\" presentations, most notably (and wonderfully) a piece about one of the movie's most important characters: its color.  They take you step-by-step through the artistic colorization process that gave each scene its unique flavor.  Even if I owned the video, I would still get the DVD just for that. Wow!
B00005AWMF|5.0|This CD is one of the best I have in my collection. It combines all of Sade's great tracks all in one. I can put this on no matter what mood I'm in and cool out. A must have for any Sade fan!
B000065U1N|5.0|Blackhawk Down is an extraordinary film about the chaos, violence, incredible fear, unexpected bravery, and the bonds between men forged in combat.  It brings modern combat to us in ways we have never seen, heard and felt before.  It tells its tale pretty honestly and  with fidelity to the facts (within a dramatic presentation).<br />I read the book, and I frankly thought it would be unfilmable, or a botched job at best.  While there were heroics there was no one hero, while there was courage, there were screwups and failures of will and the whole battle was a chaotic mess.<br />Well Ridley Scott & company have managed to convey all that while managing the incredible task of keeping the film comprehensible.  Although the battle is shown in all its fear & confusion-inducing chaos, the viewer can follow the action and not get lost in it.  A major accomplishment.  No fan of Gladiator, I thought Ridley deserved the Oscar for this incredible piece of work.<br />An ensemble piece, befitting the book's view of the combatants as parts of the group, sometimes isolated and fighting alone, but part of a whole team, we note that although personality must be submerged to the group they are still individuals, with often contradictory mixtures of fear & courage.<br />We also see the extraordinary Delta Force guys that we know so little about.  These men and their disdain for the routine military rites, ranks & disciplines are discussed at length in the book, and they are something else!<br />I won't address anyone's complaints about the treatment of the Somalis.  Read the book.  The film, by necessity, does many things in thumbnail sketches...but it does them extremely well.  We see the marketplace at the outset of the film, stalls of hanging clothing beside belts of automatic weapons ammo, and it tells us what a dangerous place Mogadishu was in an instant.  <br />That our boys were cocky and arrogant and absolutely uninstructed in who and what they were dealing with before they literally got \\"dropped into it\\" is made abundantly clear.  It's how they handled themselves and how they fought their way out of it after that this story is about.  And it is told damn well in book & movieP>What the movie is about is what the Delta guy says at the end.  It isn't about the excitement of warfare, it's about the guy next to you.  It's about the sacrifice and courage and bond of men under extreme fear and stress, fighting for their lives against overwhelming odds. And, its a true story.  Worked for me.
0201626632|5.0|I bought this book while as a master's student considering the PhD and research track, and it really opened my eyes to the work ahead.  The book is interesting, well written, and full of useful advice for making yourself a valued property in today's competitive PhD market.  I credit this book with helping me to follow a track that has me now happily employed in academia.  So of course I heatily recommend the book to anyone considering a position in research of academia.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Let me give Mulholland Drive a whirl...A compassionate director (Lynch) hates that his hands are often tied by associate producers when it comes to making films. One of the aspects he hates most is when talented, beautiful, and young would-be starlets are overlooked in the casting process. It happens often. One day a particularly appropriate actress has to be ignored by Lynch, despite the fact she's perfect. When he goes home, his conscience rips him apart and even spills over into his dreams. He can't help but wonder is she still ok? Did she take it hard? Did she eventually make it or go over the deep end? Fortunately, that artist--David Lynch--has a medium through which he can vent his frustrations and fears. The result: Mulholland Drive--Lynch's frustrations, fears, nightmares, hopes, and ultimately a tribute to the starlets that never were. There used to be three, now there's four: Fellini's &quot;8 1/2&quot;, Allen's &quot;Manhatten&quot;, Fosse's &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and now Lynch's &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.  (Quentin, the master has spoken and it's time to go back to taking notes.)
B000007NZ5|5.0|This is buy far the best Black Sabbath album.Its very dark.Every song paints a picture from the eerie opening \\"Gates of Hell\\" to the last track \\"Nightwing\\" which has a very cool acustic feel.However Im not excactly sure what the intity is their singing about in that song...an owl mayby??Brian May from Queen also did a solo on the track \\"When death calls\\" which is one of the best songs on the album.Anyway great album from begining to end.

1892065290|5.0|This is the beginning of a wonderful totally thought out series of adventures.  I fell in love with House Stark and have suffered painfully along with the various members of the family.  I also look forward for the further happenings to Daenerys.<br />I really care for some of the series going down right now. For this particular Song of Fire and Ice...I hope it does not end soon.
B00000K19E|5.0|Unfortunately, no one can be told how good this movie is, one must see it for themselves.  Keanu Reeves is Tom Anderson, a programmer by day, and a hacker by night.  He joins a group of other hackers who tell him a frightening fact: we are living in a dream world generated by a computer called the Matrix.  This band of rebels have broken out of the dream and are trying to destroy the Matrix.<BR>I was blown away by this film!  The effects are astounding, especially bullet-time, and the ripple on the building.  This movie is a little disturbing, but that doesn't hamper it's greatness.  This is the first in a trilogy, and I plan to see them all.
6300216039|5.0|Other reviews having been gazed upon, wilt I wax sort of eloquent, methinks, upon gaping slack-jawed anew at yon flickering screen...<br />I saw this film when it first appeared and I was a pre-teen, and it somewhat affected my childish boy's mind even then, but it slept in dim memory until I channel-surfed smack dab into it on AMC last month.  Durn-burn it, what's a mid-40s full-grown family man doing gushing about a length of cheap plastic tape infused with rust particles?  Simple.  One is dead inside if this film does not one affect.  Rather than echoing the many, many positive reviewer comments found here that I agree with, wilt I some other thoughts add.<br />From the commentary in the above link, it should be noted that the puns, double meanings, and poetry of Shakespeare is truly a work of art  --  you will double and otherwise completely enjoy this film once you The Bard himself hear spaketh through it.  (Mind you, this appreciation comes from a full-blown mechanical engineer, an applied physics type, not some liberal arts major.)  Some of this is captured in the film, such as Capulet welcoming his guests to his \\"poor\\" house, but you have to have done your background reading and understand the older language nuances before you can appreciate all of it.  To those reviewers who found the language difficult to understand or even boring, this is probably the reason why.  There is such power and irony in Shakespeare's words that, if you like this movie, it is worth buying a complete book with expert commentary so that you can anticipate and then fully appreciate what Zeffirelli, Whiting, Hussey, and so forth did.  I doubt this combination can ever be beaten.<br />The film plot is so exquisitely balanced and timed, reflecting Shakespeare so well, as to compel its audience into the headlong rush toward the highest of emotional highs followed immediately by the depths.  All of Romeo and Juliet's moves and lines complement each other as demonstrated by Romeo separately saying \\"O dear account!  My life is my foe's debt.\\" and by Juliet also separately saying \\"My only love sprung from my only hate.\\" at Capulet's party.  If you read a commented book, you'll find that there are many, many hints of deep foreboding at strategic locations.  Look for them to be brought to life in the film.<br />But also, notice the timeless appeal of absolute commitment to each other.  On the balcony with Romeo:  O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?  Juliet:  What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?  Romeo:  Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.  Juliet:  I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.  Romeo:  Wouldst thou withdraw it?  For what purpose, love?  Juliet:  But to be frank and give it again.  And yet I wish for the one thing I have.  My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.  The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite.<br />It seems to me that this is the essence of what makes the rest of the story so compelling.  Wert this a one-nighter of mere lust, nobody would pay attention to such true boredom.  Yet, they go through thick and thin to fulfill these, their vows.  This makes the marriage scene, short as it is, one of the most beautiful in the film.  Their vows before God are one of most powerful and satisfying outward affirmations of deep affection.  Would that such fathoms of expressive emotion could come upon more people.  Their vows and marriage are the reason that their physical celebration of it is so innocent, loving, and powerful, marking the true accuracy of this film in portraying Shakespeare's intent and Zeffirelli's homage to purity.<br />Finally, I read a lot of commentary about the youthfulness, charm, and beauty of both Leonard Whiting as Romeo and Olivia Hussey as Juliet, which added greatly to the film's emotional power.  You can also read that Shakespeare adapted this story from a tale originating in the year 1303.  He actually shaved the ages of Romeo and Juliet just a bit.  Thus, Zeffirelli made Whiting and Hussey more true to the original story!  Shakespeare did this apparently to fit into the social context of the times in which the play was written.  This is useful to know wherefore some of the plot develops as it does.<br />In short, grab a box of tissues and see the film!  And thank you very much cast and crew, even though it is 30+ years late.  'Tis an honor to thee thank.
B000066C6Z|4.0|This is the madcap Zucker Bros. at their best ( or worst as you may see it). The film is \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" from start to finish. A bit dated (as the plot calls for a plan to reunite Germany), but the sight gags and puns are non-stop, not to mention Val Kilmer's rendition of Elvis/James Brown onstage antics and music and a hilarious version of \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\" View it seven times and you will discover you missed things each time that you were laughing and skipped overbefore. It isn't for the \\"normal\\" viewer,...your sense of humor must be skewed to the off-beat satirical side. However, if you liked Police Squad and Hot Shots this non-stop insanity will light you up...!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Even though I love my other three Diana Krall albums, I was a bit hesitant to get this one because of some of the reviews. Don't be! It's softer, and less jazzy, but her vocal are sublime and the support of her quartet and the London Symphony Orchestra are a perfect match for her smooth style. S'Wonderful, Cry Me A River, I Remember You, and Dancing in the Dark are standouts in this seamless album of sensuous music. This one won't be leaving my CD player for awhile now!
0767830520|5.0|This film is a tour de force.  Scorsese is not my favorite director, but he did everything right with thtis one.  The growing apathy, frustration, and isolation of the main character (played, of course, brilliantly, by De Niro) is wonderfully displayed by well filmed scenes and priceless voice-overs that make NYC llok like a real gutter.  De Niro's character enters a campaign headquarters to woo Cybill Sheperd, and it is one of the best film scenes in history  ...The film is brutal, but honest in its own way, and tells a brilliant yet disturbing sotry as well as I can imagine...
6305499365|5.0|If there is one movie that perfectly describes the banal, soul crushing world of corporate cubicle life, this is it.  Of course it is exaggerated, but this movie still rings true to anyone who has had the misfortune of having to endure the corporate setting...  This movie gets better every time.  The more you hate your job, the more you will love it.  Buy this video and stick it to the man! (Actually I'm pretty sure if you do buy it the profits will go to some huge corporation...)  Oh well, you get the point.  Great movie.
B000002MU3|3.0|Wow.  Who thought that a single record could be a sell-out, monotonous, a masterpiece, both the band's worst and best record, and blasphemous?  But those are your exact words...  Since we all seem to have an opinion about the actual music (some of us have too much of an opinion, believing it as fact), why don't we discuss the record completely objectively?<br />Point #1.  The album is unique for REM.  They may have flirted with the idea of stoner rock, glam rock, grunge rock, or whatever else you wanna call this record, but they had never released a full album of it.  <br />Point #2.  The album is risky.  After salvaging their career by having good &quot;pop&quot; songs on &quot;Document,&quot; REM find themselves in an identical situation; trying to keep old fans while they try something new.<br />Point #3.  The album heralded (at least) 5 singles and had millions of buyers, many of whom had not listened to the band previously.  (So goes the &quot;No Hits&quot; theory so many reviewers have referred to.  REM obviously thinks differently.)<br />Point #4.  REM picked up a few new fresh-faced fans, while losing a considerable amount of hard-cores.  People have a very hard time stretching themselves, experiencing new things, facing the unknown.  Many vintage fans would be happy if REM kept producing and selling the same album over and over (referring to the similar song structure and sounds on the first four albums.)  As soon as a new element is introduced to a familiar equation, the subject ceases to be comfortable, and the listener feels &quot;cheated.&quot;<br />Opinion:  I find this to be neither REM's best nor their worst album.  But I find it to be the band's most important record, because they stray so far off from their patented sound.  They explore.  They test.  And it angers many old fans, while it could be helping them to learn to broaden their horizons, so to speak.  It happened in 1987 when REM tried to release something that was different from their firstfour albums.  It has happened to Radiohead, Metallica, Tori Amos, and several other rock-icon bands.  People hate change.  I find it invigorating and essential to our minds.  I believe in the philosophy that we should &quot;never stop moving.&quot;  Always be looking for a new way to see things.  Besides, &quot;Kenneth,&quot; &quot;Crush With Eyeliner,&quot; and &quot;I Took Your Name&quot; are in my opinion some of their best work.  Anyhow, how effective or bad the album is should be stated as a matter of opinion.  But I love REM, and I suggest that any new fan (granted they have not heard &quot;Monster&quot;) listen to the album with open ears.  Overall:  6 out of 10.
6303433766|5.0|I consider this one of the best films ever made and unarguably one of the most unforgettable; the opening scene is proof of that. This is based on the true life story of a New Zealand murder/matricide that shocked the world and it is directed by the genius Peter Jackson, who obviously insists on leaving a haunting impact on the viewer. The story follows two highly imaginative girls who're outcasts but when they meet they form an obsessive--though beautiful-- bond, creating an imaginary world only they can share, completely shutting out everyone and everything else around them. When their parents discover the intensity of their relationship, they threaten to tear them apart, causing the girls to plot the unthinkable. Both Winslet and Lynskey are mesmerizing as the beyond creative and imaginative duo who simultaneously manage to delight and frighten us with utmost perfection. They are able to move us with their dedicated affection for one another while also provoking a bit of uneasiness in us, afraid of what they're going to do next. The story is beautiful, haunting, suspenseful, thrilling, and nothing short of awe-inspiring and I highly reccommend it to anyone with a touch of creativity in them!!
B000002U8G|4.0|Floyd plays on the progressive element they had added to their musical cauldron a couple years earlier with &quot;Atom Heart Mother,&quot; a beautifully produced progressive classic.  But &quot;Meddle&quot; wins out on the former thanks to deepening musicianship, conceptual lyrics, and a style that set Floyd on a path that would eventually concieve some of the most successful albums ever.  <br />The line &quot;one of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces&quot; thickened the mystery behind the band that has never been unmasked.  Interviews seem further puzzle fans, who looked to successive albums for answers, but found only new mysteries.  &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot; show off the band's grasp on beautiful songwriting and David Gilmoure's singing.  &quot;Echoes&quot; (how could any review on this album be complete without echoes?) is of course one fo Floyd's best recorded songs; if not THE best.  Not a perfect album for sure...  It had problems to boot, concerning length and the inclusion of filler (&quot;San Tropez&quot; and especially &quot;Seamus.&quot;)  It was however a pivitol album for one of history's greatest bands, and that's something you can't meddle with.  (Horrid attempt at humor)  Overall:  7 of 10.
B00003CXXO|1.0|I have been a pretty big fan of Speilberg all my life so the fact that this...thing was directed by him was nothing more than a let down in the worst of ways! First of all, the movie lacks feeling. The characters failed at making me feel anything for them and were so predictable it was torturing!!! Haley Joel Osmont tried to come across as pitiful, wanting us to feel sorry for him, but I tell you if there has ever been a character who tried TOO hard, it would be him. There is such thing as subtlety you know and by him overdramatizing as much as he did, made this film impossible for me. I couldn't care less what happened to the little robotic boy! Secondly, there were too many plotholes and prolonged scenes that made this a complete nuisance to watch at all much less at over two hours long! And that ending...well, I won't even go there; I do have some restraint. I can't help but wonder had Kubrick directed, maybe at least the bleakness would've been felt. Speilberg, WHAT were you thinking!?!
6301661737|4.0|Kurosawa's best, shame about the vid quality/length. check out Ran and Throne of Blood, also pretty good. if you like japan in the middle ages - harder to find but just as good, kanet Shindo's 'Onibaba'.
B0000636UN|4.0|I used to hate Sheryl Crow. When the overplayed &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; got stuck in my head for weeks on end all I could think about was how much I hated Sheryl Crow.<BR> Then I grew up, heard &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; in its entirety, and realized that not only was Sheryl one of the most talented singer/songwriters of our time, but a damn good musician as well. <BR> From that moment, I was hooked. I've eagerly purchased all of Sheryl's albums, shelled out the big bucks to see her at Lilith and in concert and have not yet been disappointed. So you can understand why I was tentative and nervous about her new album, the first in almost four years.<BR> C'mon, C'mon does not disappoint. The beginning track of &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; sets the entire tone for the album, sure to be a favorite of mine this summer. &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; and &quot;You're an original&quot; follow nicely, giving the album variety yet still maintaining the &quot;feel good&quot; theme.<BR> Sheryl intelligently follows with &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; her most haunting single since &quot;Home.&quot; &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; gives the album a note of sobriety, grounding the listener. <BR> Track numbers 5-8 go by with a blur, each song seemingly to flow into the other. It is here that I feel the album has its' only weakness, the songs not exactly jelling with the rest of the album. <BR> Sheryl redeems herself with tracks 9 and 10, a cheery but emotion-filled &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and the powerful &quot;It's only love.&quot; This song, written by Sheryl, was featured on Stevie Nick's new album and arranged completely differently. Sheryl magically makes the song her own here, and it's difficult to believe that it's even the same song that Stevie recorded so beautifully. <BR> While this album is strong as a whole, it is track 13 that impacts the listener the most. &quot;Weather Channel&quot; is possibly the most daring and eerie song Sheryl has ever written. It is here thatwe are able to view the Sheryl we only hear about, the woman who is a real human being and has problems, especially dealing with depression. &quot;Weather Channel&quot; not only perfectly describes the situation of anyone who has ever thought they were crazy, but helps the listener understand her even better. <BR>C'mon, C'mon and buy this album, it is her finest work since &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;.<BR> You won't regret it.
0446310786|5.0|How can one begin a review about \\"To Kill A Mockingbird?\\" <br /> The book is so full of Passion and Tenderness...that my heart is still overflowing from the words.<br />\\"Mockingbird\\" is told from a child's point of view, Scout.  This is what makes the book so brilliant and magical.  Scout's honesty and playfulness bring such an effective narrative that the story stays with the reader long after they have finished the book.  <br />A black man wrongly accused of raping a white girl...<BR>The story is familiar. <BR> Scount's father Atticus is the attorney. <BR>I was thinking about how I would describe Atticus and the first word that came to my mind was \\"holy\\"<BR>  standing out from the rest of the town as a true man of<BR> integrity. He is the attorney for the black man.  He is the attorney who was told not to take the case. He says:  The law may change, but nothing will change unless the heart does.\\"<br />Scout asks him this question in the book:<BR>  \\"I don't get it Atticus, Mrs. Gates hates Hitler.\\"<BR>  \\" Well she should.\\"  Atticus says.<BR>  \\"But I heard her say that the next thing the blacks <BR>   will be doing is marrying our kind.  How can she hate Hitler <BR>   and say that about the blacks too?\\"<br />Scout is her father's daughter!<br /> And see what I mean about a child's point of view?  Lee  absolutely knew that children saw situations more clearly than adults.  We can learn plenty from them!<br />I wonder if Lee added Boo as a charactor as kind of a metaphor for racism...he was hidden away like some animal, people were afraid of him. Until he finally came out...Face to Face.<br />\\"Atticus, when I finally saw him, why he was real nice.\\"  Scout said.<BR>\\"Most people are, Scout, when you finally SEE them.\\"<br />A Mockingbird doesn't dig up your garden or hurt anything...he just sings and sings beautiful songs...that's why we don't kill um. That's why hurting most anything is like killin a mockingbird.
B00004Z459|1.0|a couple years ago I actually like this cd.  Now I am so ... sick and tired of it, I can not stand their ... boring music.

B00005QIPH|3.0|This is a fantastic album that has managed to live up to its hype very well.  I, and music lovers in general, should be grateful for the general vitality which the Strokes have brought back to rock.<br />It is a common pet-peeve of mine, but when the vocal track is virtually inaudible I find it extremely difficult to give credit where credit is due to Julan Casablancas.<br />\\"This is it\\" is one of the best releases in the US during the last year.  However, I beg you to please listen to The Shins.  If \\"Oh, Inverted World\\" had received half the hype as \\"This is it\\" The Shins would be the biggest rock band to come out of the States in years.
0684869713|5.0|This is absolutely a journey that consumes a tremendous amount of energy and a high level of thinking.<br />Other critics are very correct that the Fountainhead does have an ideology that may not be suitable for everybody. The key to reading any book is to read between the lines and filter the author's own ideology, and then learn the important lessons that can be learned from the book.<br />This book covers many areas in life that I was previously sub-par without understanding what caused it. Extracting one of the things said in the book:<BR>¡§Most people go to very great length in order to convince themselves of their self-respect.¡¨<BR>¡§Yes.¡¨<BR>¡§And, of course, a quest for self-respect is proof of its lack.¡¨<br />In my opinion, this book is for those who have reached a certain level of maturity in mind to think deeply for himself (or herself). The lessons from this book would be significantly less worthy otherwise. For those in the 'other' category, it is likely preferable to learn from other sources and coming back a little later.
B00005JKJA|5.0|First of all, if you're not a David Lynch fan, stop reading this review; don't watch the movie.  Lynch is one of those filmmakers where you either like him or you don't.  There's no middle ground.  Period.  If you are not the type of person who enjoys to really think about movies, then don't go any further.  Mulholland Drive is a movie that makes you ask questions---a lot of them.  If, however, you are the person who enjoys convoluted movies that remain in your head for a lengthy period of time, proceed.  Laura Harring plays a woman with amnesia who stumbles into Naomi Watts' apartment.  Naomi Watts (in a fabulous performance) tried desperately to help the strange girl find out who she is.  You won't know what's going on until after the credits have rolled, and even then, I'm not sure about closure.  I don't want to be too specific, that would ruin the surprise.  Watch Mulholland Drive, and then watch it again.  You'll need to.  Is every character really who they say they are?  You'll have to find out.  So, take a drive....on Mulholland Drive.

1587990717|5.0|I first heard Nassim speak at a TradingMarkets event and was totally floored.  I immediately picked up his book and became completely immersed in what he had to say.  Coming from a background in technical analysis, I really had issues with what he had to say but slowly I began to consider his more interesting ideas.  I'm not saying that I agree with everything he believes but I am now more than willing to consider his ideas about how and why things happen.  The hard part is figuring out how that integrates into the best trading strategy for me.  If anyone figures that out, let me know.
630518299X|4.0|My dad said that I might not like this movie because Jim Carrey was serious in it. I loved it. It was clever and sad. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank who thinks his life needs more travel. He's about to find out that there is no way out of a filming show. Whatever he tries, bus to Chicago, plane to Figi, he can't get out. His whole life is one big show and this film is an exiting picture down to the last talk with the creator. If you want a movie that is serious with Jim Carrey, buy this one! It's fun.
B000002UC5|5.0|Great expectations killed this album.  I was a teenager when this album was first released in 1970 and can tell you that people wanted a major Beatle-type production from him at that time.  Obviously, there was no way he could have lived up to the publics' expectation.  However, 'McCartney' is a great album and was not appreciated like it should have been at the time.  I like every song on the album, and after recently listening to it again a few times, I find Paul is still very much a &quot;Beatle&quot; on both 'McCartney' AND 'Ram'.  While the tracks sound a bit raw and have Linda on background vocals, both 'McCartney&quot; AND 'Ram' have a Beatle feel to them.  Very different than his Wings' sound. I find both Albums interesting for their Beatle-istic sound alone.  Basically, if you like the Beatles, you'll like 'McCartney' and 'Ram'.  They both sound great!  P.S.  I'm not a McCartney fanatic.  I believe he began his downslide with his 'Wings at the Speed of Sound' album.  With the exceptions of of a few tracks on that album, he really hasn't been the same since.
B000001IPL|4.0|The Offspring are a fantastic band who write great songs with great lyrics! Unlike the [bad] bands such as Blink 182, you can't say that the Offspring's songs are all the same. In fact, all 6 albums are very different and very good. Smash has quite a few slow tunes and quite a few fast tunes. Songs like Bad Habits, Nitro, Something to Believe in and Come out and Play are certainly worth paying money for. Alternatively get Ignition, Offspring or Ixnay on the Hombre because they are probably the best Offspring albums.
B00005BL2A|5.0|This Album may be one of DM's finest albums. You can hear the clarity &amp; sincerity in front man, Dave Gahan's voice again - He's totally recharged with life &amp; every track gives you the opportunity to hear it - Songs like Goodnight Lovers &amp; Freelove sound so surreal that you could shed a tear by how beautiful &amp; passionate Dave's voice is, which of course, wouldn't exist if not for Martin L. Gore, who again, has created an album full of musicical &amp; lyrical genius. This album is not &quot;melancholic&quot;, but rather full of seductiveness &amp; desire.
B000000Y59|3.0|The performances here are great, but I'm deducting two stars for the \\"bonus tracks\\". If a record company feels guilty that a CD will hold more music, it should reduce the price of the CD; the record itself, at least this record, is ONE work of ART. Adding \\"bonus tracks\\" to it is like adding \\"bonus paint\\" to a Van Gogh. Particularly irksome are alternate take \\"bonus tracks\\", especially alternate take \\"bonus tracks\\" placed immediately after or before the takes the artist actually wanted us to hear.<br />In the case of this version of \\"Portrait in Jazz\\", however, the liner notes at least attempt to explain what the alternate takes are doing here. In my opinion, though, its arguments are invalid: <br />1) The extra \\"Blue in Green\\" is included, allegedly, because the producer didn't understand why Bill Evans failed to choose it. As far as I'm concerned, all that matters is that he didn't; Bill Evans is the artist; this is Bill Evans's choice to make. <br />2) The extra \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is included, allegedly, because the preferred take (which is the one incongruously listed as a \\"bonus track\\" here, oddly enough) was recorded in mono. Guess what? Stereo recording is not NECESSARILY an improvement over mono recording, not any more so than oil painting is necessarily an improvement over watercolor. Stereo and mono are merely different media: If a piece is intentionally and artfully recorded in mono, then it is worth hearing in mono.<br />If you feel nevertheless absolutely compelled to give us \\"bonus tracks\\", please put them all at the beginning of the CD. That way I can just punch on my remote the first track number after them and not have to fuss.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Sometimes film can change you. A film can alter how you feel about any well depicted profession. It can mother the notions of what love must feel like. It can drag you through the darkest and most dire circle of hell. It can exploit a pessimist's worst apocalyptic vision into an immensely valuable anti drug statement. It can shock you scene after scene with its honesty and its unflinchingly brutal depiction of the desperation of the inner city, and at what price peace can there be achieved. One of the top five films produced in the past 20 years, and in the name of freedom of speech, priceless.
B00005QIPH|3.0|You know how when you are at a sporting event and a player on the opposing team is hyped by fans and the media as the next best thing and the crowd is chanting \\"Over-rated\\" clap clap clap-clap-clap! \\"Over-rated\\" Well that is exactly what I wanted to do when I heard this CD.  It is not bad, but it is definitly nothing groundbreaking and there are several bands doing this stripped down rock and roll thing a lot better than these guys.  If I ever start a band, I would like to hire their PR guy because the hype surrounding this band was (and still is) incredible
B00000IBVC|4.0|I wanted to find out more about this opera ever since I heard Sarah Brightman perform &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;live in Houston and in Las Vegas as the last song before the intermission for her &quot;La Luna&quot; tour, it is such an awesome aria that I had to know more about it origins. THis was an awesome performance, I wonder if those who got to see this production realized the massive undertaking it took to produce it. Now I hope that they had HD cameras in 1998 so that we can get a 1080i HD-DVD of this in the future.

The album became a huge sucess for radio head among with fans and critics. Namend one of the best albums of all time and best album s of the 90s and the best album of 1997. This album is probably and will be indeed rememberd for the songs on it. This album containes one of the best music you will ever find. It is different from The Bends but has a great musical force on it. <BR>All songs here are great and the album gets better and better with each song. Buy it.

B000005RT8|4.0|Over the years the myth has grown that of the Lennon-McCartney partnership that it was John who was the boldest and most  experimental of the two. Well, in The Beatles context, I'd give John the edge, but not by the wide  margin that many would. It was  actually pretty close. But as solo artists, it's Paul, by a long shot. Despite John's  bizarre and horrific avant-garde excursions with Yoko in the late '60's, his solo music wasn't all that experimental.  Now \\"McCartney 2\\" is a definite experiment, and it pays off. Recorded mainly by himself, just  as his first solo album a decade prior-- but not at all similar. Here, Paul uses synths and all sorts of electronic gadgetry as well as the bass, guitars and drums. What resulted may not be  all that striking today, but it  was an enormously bold move for McCartney back in 1980. It's true that some of the songs  are underdeveloped and that others are just curiousities that amount to filler. That has to be expected. But everything works together. I especially like 'Temporary Secretary' (almost flat out New Wave), 'Coming Up', 'Bogey Music' (his weirdest lp track to  date), 'Waterfalls', 'Summers Day Song' and 'One Of These Days'. Any one of the last three that I mentioned would, in a different style, have fit perfectly on the \\"White Album\\". They're that good. Overall \\"McCartney 2\\" is an odd entry in the artists canon but a very worthy one. And not his weakest. Still, not the place for the curious to start with Paul's prolific and remarkable solo career, this despite the great variety of music present.
0783226128|5.0|The best movie of all time.  Scarface is the favorite among every Rap artist and is the best Gangster movie in existence.  The Godfather pt. 1 and 2 come in second but this one tops the charts.  Al Pacinos best roll in his career.  If you love gangster movies buy this one, do not rent it.....BUY IT.... you will not regret it.

B00005JKJA|5.0|The film clearly states its theme during the opening credits: the psychological inflations of youth with its passions: joy, lust, love, exhilaration and also betrayal, pain and destructiveness.  In the opening credits, Diane/Betty is shown with parental or grandparental figures, in the psychologically inflated `albedo' state - the `pure white' state (in alchemy) - of innocence, in which everything appears to be positive and possible.  It is a state of exhilaration and sexual openness, indicated by the teenagers dancing - yet it casts a huge shadow (in the Jungian sense) also seen by the shadows cast by the dancers.  The theme is immediately continued with the `immortal' teenagers joyriding in the opening frames of Diane's `dream'.  <br />The older couple who have accompanied her on the plane to LA, are equally intoxicated with Betty's youth, beauty and promise - as many parents and grandparents are - and they are the witnesses of her hopes, ambitions and ideals and in effect, egg her on towards greater inflation.  It is no wonder that they reappear as her final psychic tormentors at the end of the film, loading her with guilt and opprobrium, reminding her of how far she has fallen from her own `dreams'.<br />Coco, on the other hand, represents an older person, who has `survived' what Diane/Betty is going through -this is why she can offer Diane the hand of comfort at the dinner party.  Her status as survivor is made clear at her first appearance, when she greets Betty with a mock starlet's pose, saying `Here I am, in all my glory!'  She has gotten over it.<br />The alchemical nigredo stage - in which the all-positive illusions of the albedo/innocent stage are demolished, `burnt' to blackness, is symbolized by the personification of death who lives behind the diner.  All our fondest hopes and wishes, our joys and activities and relationships are just the fodder of dreams from his perspective.  They play as tiny figures around his `pandora's box.'<br />The whole firsthalf of the film is Diane's dream after she has put out the hit on Camilla.  Her `first-falling-in-love' identity issues are explored there, along with all sorts of other bric-a-brac from Diane's conscious and subconscious mind.  Other reviewers have described these well.  We really only know Diane from her dreams, but we grow to care about her - at least I did - I did fall for that sweet corn-fed Midwestern innocent - and therefore the film is ultimately profoundly sad.  <br />In alchemy, there is a third stage: the rubedo, when we have successfully negotiated the break-down and disappointment of the nigredo, we emerge in a transformed state, where real joy, love and ecstasy are at last possible.  This stage is very different from the `white' albedo stage.  But Diane/Betty does not reach this stage.  She is a `failed alchemist.'  But David Lynch is anything but a failed artist.
B0000027I6|4.0|It all makes perfect sence!  <br />Had Roger stayed on in Pink Floyd, this would have likely been the wonderful, wonderful album it deserves to be.  As it is, it could improve.  Roger's vocals are at a whisper for nearly the whole album and the musical aspect (other than Jeff Beck's guitar) is not up to par with the lyrical message.  However, being ...[up] for lyrical content, I forgave \\"God\\" for this album.  <br />I reccomend the purchase of this album as well as Rog's live set, In The Flesh.  One will find much clearer vocals and, in the case of \\"The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range\\" and \\"Perfect Sence,\\" a much more powerful musical experience.
B00005N9CV|5.0|One of the most beautiful CD's I own.  Diana Krall's voice is beyond description, her diction articulate.  I dare anyone to listen to &quot;Love Letters&quot; and not get chills from her beautiful, moving rendition of this classic.  &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; is also wonderful.
B00000331V|5.0|The J. Geils Band is a cross between the sound of The Blues Brothers and George Thorogood & The Destroyers. There's J. Geils's guitars, Danny Klein's bass, Seth Justman's keyboards, Stephen Jo Bladd's percussion, Magic Dick's harps, and Peter Wolf's vocals. Speaking of Peter Wolf, he was a former DJ of the manic variety whos late-night raps found their way into his stage routine. Peter Wolf was a classic rapper, between songs, long before rap went mainstream. Woofuh Goofuh with the green teeth and all you Whammer Jammers out there. A J. Geils Band live show gave new meaning to Don't Stop Until You Drop!<br />Track 1, Southside Shuffle, is an intimate little number with a Wilson Pickett & Eddie Floyd hometown record feel to it.<br />Track 2, Back To Get Ya, is an R&B groove influenced by the sound of The Ohio Players. It's funky!<br />Track 3, Shoot Your Shot, was originally recorded by Jr. Walker & The All Stars in 1967.<br />Track 4, Musta Got Lost, was originally from Geils 1974 album Nightmares. It is preceded by a classic Peter Wolf Woofuh Goofuh rap.<br />Track 5, Where Did Our Love Go, is the classic Supremes (Diana Ross) #1 hit single from 1964.<br />Track 6, Truck Drivin' Man, has been recorded by dozens of country music artists. Peter Wolf was, besides a big blues and R&B fan, a big country music fan.<br />Track 7, Loveitis, is a straight-ahead rocker. Tonsillitis, bursitis, loveitis. Makes sense to me.<br />Tracks 8 & 9, Looking For Love was a Bobby Womack Top 10 R&B hit for The Valentinos that starts off as a slow intro before Geils blasts into (Ain't Nothin' But A) Houseparty.<br />Track 10, So Sharp, was a 1967 song from Dyke & The Blazers. When you need some juice to get loose, you listen to Dyke & Blazers, recommends Peter Wolf.<br />Track 11, Detroit Breakdown, is the classic J. Geils party song.<br />Track 12, Chimes, is sort of a mood song allowing some instrumental stretching for the guys.<br />Track 13, Sno-Cone, is a blues great Albert Collins jungle rhythm instrumental that Geils used to open their shows with back in the early days. It set the tone and let the audience know what was coming.<br />Track 14, Wait, is a lyrically silly little song influenced by Mose Allsion the jazz pianist.<br />Track 15, Raise Your Hand, is an Eddie Knock On Wood Floyd song that represents sort of a roots thing for the band.<br />Track 16, Start All Over, was originally written after this lady, that Peter was very close to, died in a tragic auto accident while the band was on the road. The lyrics changed as time went on, but the chorus was about trying to deal with the end of something and the beginning of something new.<br />Track 17, Give It To Me, was a reggae style song influenced by Bob Marley. It was a big hit until it got banned from the radio. They said the lyrics were too suggestive. That's hard to believe, because a few weeks later, Chuck Berry's \\"My Ding-A-Ling\\" came out and didn't get banned. In fact, it went to #1. It might have had something to do with the fact that, at the time, The J. Geils Band were the underdogs who were kicking and scratching and crawling their way to the top.<br />The J. Geils Band - BLOW YOUR FACE OUT . . .<br />. . . MADE LOUD TO PLAY LOUD!
6301963717|5.0|No doubt that Miller's Crossing is a wonderful film, but I have always been disappointed that the Coen Bros didn't see fit to give Dashiell Hammett some sort of on-screen credit.  The film is without a doubt an adaptation of THE GLASS KEY with a little RED HARVEST thrown in.  Read these wonderful novels and you'll see what I mean.  Every single bit of the memorable dialogue from the movie is taken, practically word for word, from these great books.  From the moment you read &quot;What's the rumpus&quot; in the first chapter of RED HARVEST, or realize that Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig from THE GLASS KEY are EXACTLY the same characters as Tom and Leo in the movie ('cept Ned does borrow money from Paul to pay off his bookie), you get an uneasy feeling that somebody is owed some credit.  All credit in the world to the Coens for creating a wonderful script, and to Barry Sonnenfeld for shooting a gorgeous movie (he shoulda stuck to being a DP), but the DVD version will hopefully contain some tribute to Hammett, who is the real genius behind Miller's Crossing.
B000002A3T|3.0|Many of the other reviews here attack the perception that THE DIVISION BELL is not truly a Pink Floyd album. The trouble is, neither side is correct. None of the post-Roger Waters Floyd albums measure up to the classic albums of the 70s, and none of the Roger Waters solo efforts do either (including THE FINAL CUT, which was for all practical purposes a Waters solo effort and was originally intended to be released as such).<br />Pink Floyd wasn't just about one man's vision or another man's virtuoso playing. It really was a band. What you hear on THE DIVISION BELL is some of the component elements of Pink Floyd... Gilmour's smooth voice and languid guitar; Richard Wright's psychedelic musicality. But it lacks the edge that Waters brought with his sharp lyrics and vocal rasp. Despite all the talent imported to help with the lyrics, they are unimpressively mediocre, not much better than high-school poetry. Conversely, Waters' solo efforts lack the memorable musicality that the other members brought. They're biting but forgettable.<br />Compared to A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON, the first and only other post-Waters studio album, THE DIVISION BELL is a more sophisticated and unified effort, and a bit lighter in sound. It lacks, however, the musical hooks that made the former album a success. Not that this record did poorly, of course. Anything with the Floyd name is going to go top ten automatically, even if it's a CD case full of dog poo.

The only reason I point this out is because all these other customer reviews laud the Coens as if they invented this genre of crime story, and as if they invented the dialogue, plot, and themes out of whole cloth.  Do yourself a favor, and read Hammett's five novels and the Continental Op stories, and suddenly you'll realize where the Coens derived their inspiration.  Perhaps the DVD version (if there ever is one) could highlight this ...  Otherwise, a truly amazing movie that takes the concept of \\"hard boiled\\" to a whole new level.
0451196716|5.0|That's all I can -- WOW.  I've read everything by Stephen King, and this is one of only two stories that has ever given me nightmares.  It's awesome -- just sit there and think for a minute about being in those boys' shoes.  Can you even imagine?  This is such an original tale, the perfect example of why I started to read the Master of Horror to begin with -- alas, I wish he still wrote stories like this.
0515127485|5.0|I found Archangel by Robert Harris to be mesmeizing in its unflinching blending of fact and fiction. Realistic, imperfect  characters trying to deal with the horror and terror of the past while obessively running head long into it in the present. Harris is a master at developing characters and an complex storey line that holds you in a death grip till the final climax. Bravo Robert Harris you have just made this readers top ten list. If you like intrigue, unapologetic grit, and your fiction, intelligent, hardnosed and unrelenting then you must read this book. His interweaving of fact and fiction paint a picture of true evil, its power and its ramifications. Magnificent!!!

What could have been for Rubin was spoiled by some awful, awful people.  I hope you can still smile Rubin !
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby can be more downbeat an introspective than most other techo artists (Fatboy Slim, say) and that is a compliment.  There are no bad songs on this album and many have now seeped into popular consciousness; like Porceline and Southside.  One word of warning: this version of Southside doesn't feature Gwen from No Doubt.
B00005NWM3|4.0|In the not so distant past, in an interview, lead singer, Chad Kroeger, made a comment about Nickelback's search for a particular sound they wanted to achieve. The band seemed to be floundering, lost in an all too familiure rock-bar-circuit-jam. It was when this Canadian foursome finally attended a Metallica concert, experiencing the magic and force behind the legend that the penny dropped. At that point, Kroeger, had an idea about the direction the band needed to follow, then, their second album ~Silver Side Up~ presented on the scene, and the band hasn't looked back.<br />For most Rock pundits, Nickelback's music has been difficult to categorise: the general opinion is a blend of 90's grunge with popular themes, however, the band denies they're a Metal band, and prefer to call the music \\"Groove Rock\\".<br />When their hit single 'How You Remind Me\\" hit the Australian airwaves, one couldn't turn on the radio without hearing it. A month later, their song 'Too Bad' burst into earshot, and Aussie audiences just can't seem to get enough.<br />Certain sources report that this CD has sold well over one million in America, and could well achieve at least half that in Australia. Considering Australia's population,(19 million) this is no small task. But for my money, I believe they'll exceed this number, as ~Silver Side Up~ is a Rock gem.<br />All the tunes on this CD rings consistently of that almost forgotten Rock energy of the mid 80's and early 90's...Chad's brother, Mark, adept bass manoeuvring, backing Ryan Peak's excellent guitar, coupled with Kroeger's feeling-growling voice and you have such fist-pounding tunes like 'Money Bought' and 'Where Do I Hide'. The whole CD is pure Rock listening pleasure.<br />~Silver Side Up~ deserves to belong in any Rock pundits collection.
0140177396|5.0|Because it is more &quot;socially relevant&quot;, The Grapes of Wrath is the Steinbeck novel most often pushed on students - who promptly get turned-off by him.  Don't let that happen to you.  Of Mice and Men is his second best novel (the first being East of Eden) and it has everything that makes Steinbeck great.  It is a short, fast read so you might as well give it a chance.  The story itself is so archetypical as to be almost mythic - there is Lenny, the good-hearted, strong simpleton; George, his protector; Curly, the short, cruel, bully and his dangerous wife.  <br />Also, if you've ever seen a Looney Toon wherein a big, dumb character says something like, &quot;Tell me about the rabbits, George&quot; that is from this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I will strongly recommend to all people to watch this fantastic musical. I love it not because of the cast or the director but the songs and the way she was expressed. the first 30 to 45 mins were energetic, almost noisy, but it didn't detory the original melodies.<BR>I have a friend said that the photography is worse in Tango, he wanted to watch the whole figure of the dancers but not their heads. Hullo! The film is from a &quot;VISIONARY&quot; director, you shoud know that it must not filmed regulary, as a musical on the stage. If you didn't like it, don't watch it then. <BR>All of all it is the most marvelous musical I have ever watch! Get it !
B000059MEK|5.0|You can listen to this one over and over, without skipping any tracks. It's great to just pop in the CD player and chill to. Think about it: how many albums are there where you can honestly say that you enjoy every song? The style is original enough to appeal to a wide variety of musical tastes.
0792156684|5.0|There's two kinds of people in this world: Those who love Titanic because it's an absolutely amazing movie that should jerk the tears right out of you and make you want to learn more than you already know about the unsinkable ship, and those who say they hated Titanic because they want the attention of being one of the few that hates such an obviously great movie.<br />Then again, it takes a lot of people to make the world go round. If you're normal...that is, if you know how to go grocery shopping, if you buy popcorn or hot tamales at the theater, if you eat cereal for breakfast, if you enjoy picnics with your family, and if sports aren't a barbaric waste of your precious time, then you'll enjoy this movie.<br />Just watch the movie and don't try to be superior to the movie. Nobody will like you.<br />When you allow yourself to enjoy the movie (instead of watching it for the sole purpose of picking it apart to impress your acquaintances who really don't like you if you're a person who would do such a thing), you'll be convinced the characters are on the ship. You'll be symphathetic to Rose's problems, which are particularly interesting considering she's so gorgeous and so loaded. Peasants from my tax bracket long to be in the shoes of someone so wealthy, but apparently it ain't so easy. No chance of me finding out, anyway.<br />Jack is our hero, because he's carefree without being a flake. He's also friendly, generous, and open, which makes it easy to admire the guy.<br />3.5 hours for this movie to begin and finish, and there shouldn't be a single moment's worth of boredom to you, with the possible exception of the beginning of the movie, which shows modern day Bill Paxton looking for sunken Titanic treasure (I bet he was the first to ever think of that idea! Hey Bill, while you're down there, see if you can find Atlantis for us. I hear that place had lots of gold). The characters, as I said, are very likable, except for the villains, which are dislikable...and very convincing.<br />The action is excellent, and the unbelievable stuff (Rose cutting through cuffs with an axe while her eyes are closed) doesn't leave you shaking your head. Your adreneline is pumping too much. Rising water makes nobody comfy.<br />The last hour or so was very touching, as the passengers and crew realize that the boat is sinking, and some are about to die.

0780624890|5.0|This is the pivotal Wesley Snipes movie to own. First off he's biggest he's ever been muscle wise in this movie, he is ridiculously nasty in every fight scene in the movie and believe me there are a whole lot, plus on top of it Wesley choreographed all of the fights in the movie which not many people know. Stephen Dorff also gives a great performance as Deacon Frost which one him an MTV award for best villain. The only problem if any is that this movie is way more action than horror which may be somewhat disappointing for those expecting a scary movie. However, the action is so unbelievable it just makes this movie worth owning.
0792156684|5.0|There's two kinds of people in this world: Those who love Titanic because it's an absolutely amazing movie that should jerk the tears right out of you and make you want to learn more than you already know about the unsinkable ship, and those who say they hated Titanic because they want the attention of being one of the few that hates such an obviously great movie.<br />Then again, it takes a lot of people to make the world go round. If you're normal...that is, if you know how to go grocery shopping, if you buy popcorn or hot tamales at the theater, if you eat cereal for breakfast, if you enjoy picnics with your family, and if sports aren't a barbaric waste of your precious time, then you'll enjoy this movie.<BR>Just watch the movie and don't try to be superior to the movie. Nobody will like you.<BR>When you allow yourself to enjoy the movie (instead of watching it for the sole purpose of picking it apart to impress your acquaintances who really don't like you if you're a person who would do such a thing), you'll be convinced the characters are on the ship. You'll be symphathetic to Rose's problems, which are particularly interesting considering she's so gorgeous and so loaded. Peasants from my tax bracket long to be in the shoes of someone so wealthy, but apparently it ain't so easy. No chance of me finding out, anyway.<BR>Jack is our hero, because he's carefree without being a flake. He's also friendly, generous, and open, which makes it easy to admire the guy.<BR>3.5 hours for this movie to begin and finish, and there shouldn't be a single moment's worth of boredom to you, with the possible exception of the beginning of the movie, which shows modern day Bill Paxton looking for sunken Titanic treasure (I bet he was the first to ever think of that idea! Hey Bill, while you're down there, see if you can find Atlantis for us. I hear that place had lots of gold). The characters, as I said, are very likable, except for the villains, which are dislikable...and very convincing. <br />The action is excellent, and the unbelievable stuff (Rose cutting through cuffs with an axe while her eyes are closed) doesn't leave you shaking your head. Your adreneline is pumping too much. Rising water makes nobody comfy.<br />The last hour or so was very touching, as the passengers and crew realize that the boat is sinking, and some are about to die.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|Not since 'Phantom of the Opera' has a film or a 'Musical soundtrack' to boot captivated audiences with its pioneering storyline modified to appeal to the masses and the millennium with such applaudable success.<br />I loved this soundtrack, I loved hearing 2 of the hottest actors of our generation earn their magebucks and show us such fantastic melifluous voices and deliver the lyrics so evokingly accurate to the core story of the film.<br />Not since Evita has their been a soundtrack like this, just listen to Ewan Macgregor ( the force IS with him ) sing 'Come what may' it like many others on this album are a tour de force of emotion and originality and renews your faith in Hollywood.<br />... , whether your taste in music is diversified or not this a cool , moving , retro , hip album and your a phillistine without it.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|It was the record company's fault.  I know Baz Lurhmann would never have agreed to release a &quot;soundtrack&quot; to his beloved MOULIN ROUGE that consisted of so few songs actually heard (in these renditions) in the film.<br />Sure, listening to this compilation of songs featured in MOULIN ROUGE is fun--but you'll be disappointed if you think you're getting the film version.  The songs sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are here in their original state (except for a remixed version of &quot;Come What May,&quot; which makes the song work better as a song than as the dramatic moment it is in the film), as is a nice tune by Rufus Wainwright.<br />But missing are some of the film's true highlights: &quot;The Pitch (Spectacular! Spectacular!),&quot; &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; and the actual medley comprising &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;  Instead, we get TWO versions of &quot;Nature Boy&quot; (only one of which sounds like the film version), a horrible tune by Beck (featured because of a reference to &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; in the screenplay), and a lackluster version of &quot;Children of the Revolution.&quot;<br />You'll enjoy it for what it is--but be warned, you WILL have to purchase VOLUME 2.  And even then, you will be left wanting--waiting--and hoping--for a VOLUME 3.

B00000J8EK|3.0|Well, it was definitly a let-down compared to the previous Grammy-Award Winning 'Dig Your Own Hole' but with songs such as Music: Respone (which undoubtedly sound similar to that of Hendrix's Foxy Lady)and ultimate classics that no-one ever forgets like Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Let Forever Be are definitly the cream of The Chems. I don't know if i'll surrender to them, but i'll definitly come with them.<br />Signing Off Now,<BR>Brad Cummins
B00003CXDG|5.0|If you liked the original Mission Impossible movie with Tom Cruise you will love this one.  It has everything: love, motorcycles, mountain climbing, free-fall off of tall buildings, plots twists and disguises.  A great action movie with wonderful special effects.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan is a genius.  After reading Attonement, I started his novel Enduring Love and found that to be equally fantastic.  Attonement is my favorite but I want to read all his novels. The start is a little slow but once the crime has occurred I dare you to put it down!

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV is perhaps one of the finest rock records ever produced.     There have been few albums ever recorded that can match this for its sheer emotional power and artistic and musical depth. The only ones in my opinion that equal it are \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Nevermind\\". \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Who's Next\\" come close but they don't quite claw their way on to the same level as Zeppelin IV.    I know the critics savaged Zeppelin back in their heyday but now, with the benefit of hindsight you can see that this record was decades ahead of its time.     Every major hard rock/heavy metal act that has existed since 1971 owes something to Led Zeppelin and the influence of this record. No popular music collection is complete without it.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind was a pretty good movie.  I'm undecided as to whether or not I think it was worth winning Best Picture at the Oscars, though mainly because I didn't think any of them really deserved it.  I liked it but I didn't love it.  And I certainly didn't think that Russell Crowe deserved to win Best Actor.  And in a way, Jennifer Connelly deserved to win Best Supporting Actress last year for her role in Requiem For A Dream.  I'm not saying that the buzz surrounding this movie is false, but just that maybe it didn't deserve all that it got.  I think a lot of hype from this movie came from Russell Crowe, the controversial man of the year, and people heard that he might get a 3rd nomination for this movie so they just assumed it was going to be great.  Anyway, my feeling of not loving this movie does not have anything to do with all the reports about it not being entirely accurate or leaving stuff out.  I personally don't care what they left out or not.  All I cared about was what was already in the movie, which is good.  So don't get me wrong--I don't think this was a bad movie at all.  Ron Howard certainly proved his worth in directing.  But I AM saying that it's not the best film of the year.  But you should still go see if because it's a darn good movie.
B000000993|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Tool, mainly because most would consider me ignorant, because I don't really understand the music.  I do listen to them a lot though and I'll admit it is very very good.  Undertow, I'd say, and apparently others would too, that this is Tool's best album.  I like the songs on this c.d. much better than the others, and overall, I think they are better musically.  Any music fan should buy this album.
B00003CXMG|2.0|Maybe I'll never understand why this movie was as popular as it was.  I saw a couple of days ago for the first time and after the first hour and a half, I couldn't wait until it was done.  Now, maybe I don't think that it's one of the worst movies of the year but I definitely think that it was one of the dumbest.  And talk about bad acting--I can't figure out why they would hire an actor to play the main role when he can't even act (or at least act convincingly) himself.  The acting of Patrick Fugit brings to mind the HORRIBLE acting (or lack-there-of) of Tobey Maguire, Elijah Wood, and other teen actors who need to find something else to do with their lives other than ruin potentially good movies.  And then there's Kate Hudson.  How in the world did she get an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award for this role??  That's more confusing than trying to see a point to this whole movie.  The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars instead of one is for Frances McDormand.  She is the only actor in this whole movie to actually be acting.  She saves this movie (barely) from becoming a train wreck.  She is a good actress (better than I knew) and she is the only reason why I actually finished this movie.  It's not worth your time because there's really no point to this movie AT ALL.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am left speechless.  I literally just finished watching Donnie Darko and it has left me without words (and that's an extreme rarity for me).  And now I know I want to buy the movie.  Yes, it is very original, but also it's very thought-provoking.  I think a few more viewings (and by few, I mean a lot) will be necessary.  Especially, I after I buy it.  Donnie Darko is the story of a teen coming face-to-face with his dark reality.  A strange bunny man visits him during his delusions with talks of time travel and mischievous acts.  Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze have minor roles in comparison to Jake Gyllenhaal's part, but all the characters have important roles.  I wish I could write a better review and maybe I will once I can regain my thoughts back.  But for now, this is my first reaction and it's a great one.  A fantastic movie.
6303347657|4.0|I wish this video would've been widescreen.  I do so hate the pan-and-scan, but for this movie it works well. Jim Carrey, you gotta love him for all the effortless feats he performs in this film.  As shy banker Stanley Ipkis he is a gem, and even more remarkable when he acquires The Mask.  I am a recent fan of his, and have been seeing his movies that I missed.  This one is the definitive funny man and the story isn't half bad either.  I loved Cuban Pete.  Even the neurotic Stanley who visits a popshrink of a book about masks people wear reminded me so much of a typical Carrey action.  A must see for all Carrey fans!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Now, Guy Pearce is great.  Joe Pantoliano is great.  Carrie-Anne Moss is great.<br />But the star of this movie is the storytelling device.  Told in 5-8 minute scenes shown in reverse order, this is a ripping good murder mystery yarn.  But if it was told in order, showing the wonderful twist ending first, there really wouldn't be much here.  This movie is a joy to experience, but I'm left with a sense of \\"wait a minute\\" when I reflect on the story and how it fit together--there's one unfortunate coincidence that a large part of the story turns on, and it makes the whole thing feel more contrived than clever.<br />Pearce plays Leonard, a man who can't store any new long-term memories:  if it didn't happen in the last 5-8 minutes,  it didn't happen.  Notes to himself are his only record of events, and the reliability of these notes--even the permanent ones--is constantly tested.  He's riding the knife edge between this moment and the distant past--these are the only worlds he knows, and he lives his life as a victim to the cavernous gap between them.<br />Now, this character has enormous potential that largely goes unrealized so that the film can concentrate on the plot, which focuses on Leonard's hunt for the man who murdered his wife.<br />Carrie-Anne Moss is a waitress/love-interest(?) who is involved in a sub-plot that is never fully realized.  Her impact on the main story and the main character is what's important.<br />The difficult thing is that because of his curious mental problem, no one in the movie can actually have impact on Leonard beyond messing with his head, which everyone in the movie takes an opportunity to do.  (Please note that I said \\"everyone.\\")<br />All in all, it's an enjoyable tale with a unique storytelling style populated with excellent performances from actors portraying characters whose development was sacrificed to the gods of plot and storytelling.<br />Yes, this is one that Hitchcock would have wanted to make, but I daresay he wouldn'thave done a better job--I think this one's as sharp and tasty as the script allows.  Cheers to Christoper Nolan the director, but jeers to Christopher Nolan the screenwriter, who needs a few lessons developing characters.

B00005U18E|5.0|American Renee Zellweger did it.  She made a convincing Brit.  She also looked fabulous, even though she had to gain weight for the role.  I loved this movie.  The script was a well-done adaptation and it is very fun to watch.<br />I was very surprised by the performance of Hugh Grant.  He typically gets cast in the romantic lead role, playing some sort of charming, bumbling idiot that you can't help but fall in love with.  This movie, he actually tries something different.  He still plays an idiot, but this time he's the sort of idiot you love to hate.  It's a nice change.  And, if there are any of you out there who hate Hugh Grant, this is the movie for you--there is a particular scene that you'll love (but I don't want to ruin it for you).<br />Colin Firth also does a marvelous job.  His character is probably one of the most interesting in the movie (aside from Bridget herself).  He progresses in a way that you don't really expect from the beginning, and it's rather nice.  I love Colin Firth.<br />If you're in a bad mood, this is a great movie to see.  It fits the romantic comedy mold, but it's good to watch even if you're not a fan of that genre.  It's great fun.
B00005QW4K|4.0|I first saw this film as the second part of a double feature at a drive in back in 1993. I liked it at times, but I could not believe how stupid it was at other times. I had seen the first film before and was surprised at what kind of AOD was. That fall I saw Brisco County Jr. on FOX and began to realize the brilliance of Bruce Campbell. A lesser actor could not have pulled this one off. I began to see AOD on tv a lot during the mid-90's and I really began to appreciate just how funny thei film. Most horror comedies tend to fall flat because they feel the need to be all comedy in partsd and all horror in other parts, but this film integrates the two well.<BR>   The bootleg has the original negative ending (which I prefer) as well as commentary and four deleted scenes. Another review mentioned the bad quality of this film at times and that may be true, but I remember this film looking dark and grainy when I saw it at the drive in and on cable. I think the grainy look during the battle only adds to the charm because it reminds me of the way the old Harryhausen films look.
B000006IUQ|4.0|Lee Tamahori (Once were Warriors, Along Came a Spider)'s underrated thriller starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin is an exciting adventure that is not only an all- star film (including Elle Macpherson) but also has great action and one huge grizzly bear!<br />Why this film wasn't really successful is unclear, some critics moaned about the ending but I think it wraps the film up while being devoid of sentiment and has some good statements about friendship and survival.<br />Anthony Hopkins is excellent in this, and Baldwin has his best role since The Hunt For Red October (1990). Some scenes in this are truly terrifying and exciting, and it makes for a really exhilarating roller coaster of a film. First-rate entertainment.
B0000248L1|5.0|This cd was a revelation to me when it was released I had never heard a guitarist that good yet!  He was an amazing lead player & his rhythms/riffs were the absolute best!... When I listen to this now I wish there was more low end and so on but it just cannot be beat especially when considering all the money I spent after buying Annihilator import cds never as good as this release!  I still think Never, Neverland rules too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0767803434|4.0|Air Force One is one of my favourite action films, as it is for many people, and it's easy to see why. Wolfgang Petersen's action thriller starring Harrison Ford as the president of America is a taut, exciting action flick (And sure to never be in-flight entertainment).<br />Gary Oldman is the movie's main villain, a terrorist with some scores to settle. Both he and Ford are great, and with the added start power of William H.Macy and Glenn Close make this big-name action-fest great fun.<br />Performances, action scenes, special effects and music (Jerry Goldsmith) are all top-notch, as well as some great patriotic stuff from Harrison. The only thing I don't like is some scenes are predictable and jingoism takes over sometimes. Regardless, it's great fun, and an equally great DVD. Cool stuff.
0688156819|5.0|You may be familiar with Tim Burton's directorial work, and you may be familiar with Edward Gorey, but you aren't familiar with this. I came across this book in a little goth store..., and, as a huge Burton fan, snatched it up immediately.<br />If you like Edward Gorey, you'll like this. Especially if you've read all of his stuff and are looking for more of the same. Burton's book is a tiny bit more twisted and oddball than Gorey (if possible), but the illustrations are delightful and extremely talented.<br />This is a very unique book to add to your library.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is a great film.  I had to rate the DVD with stars , when it isn't even available???????<br />  A lot of my friends were upset when we heard the theatrical  re-release will include \\"computer\\" generated scenes of E.T....etc.....We would want the original  film released on dvd!!!!<br />The whole beauty of the ORIGINAL E.T. film, was just that........it was a great Spielberg movie, made with what he had available to him at that time....why should it be changed? What makes us think a great movie maker like Spielberg would want to change his original great work....does Spielberg need the work?  I doubt with his talent that  this is really the case......or is it a financial decision  , maybe from the studio?   If enough people rally for the original, maybe we will get it on DVD , in the pure first rendition.......and then, when the altered version comes out...the people who want that one...... can buy it!!!!  Let us who love the original E.T. character puppet have our DVD!!!!!<br />AND if it is changed, I hope the DVD release is FIRST from the original filming, with any added trailers, scenes, and of course......widescreen!!!!!  I have it on VHS but want the original on DVD...PLEASE!!!!!
0451526384|5.0|This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.<br />It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Musgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Musgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her. <br />Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Musgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book.
0385505833|5.0|what a fabulous book.  would certainly become a great movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from the very first page to the last.<br />The book highlights the materialism of american christmas,  and truly hightlights the amount of money that is spent on christmas because of the hype created by people all around you,.<br />The Kranks a really funny couple decides to skip christmas and get away from the madness of it all.  It truly shows the resistance that they have to all the fancies around them.  But something more than their own enjoyment pops up in the last minute and they decide to do christmas on christmas day.  This shows the greatest sacrifice our parents always end up making for us children.<br />Very touching book and very funny.  Guys if ur feeling down buy this book.  Lots to learn in there

0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith's remarkable first novel, White Teeth, deserves all the praise and attention it's gotten since its publication two years ago. This big, rich multicultural cacophony of a novel is a brilliant comic narrative that captures the mixture and conflict of races, ethnicities, cultures, and beliefs in London at the millenium. Moreover, unlike other British writers who sometimes seem condescending and unabashedly full of themselves (Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie immediately come to mind), Zadie Smith's writing is full of good humor and prescient insight into the value of even the most disparate life experiences. <br />Smith anchors her story around the unlikely friendship of an easy-going, seemingly unflappable working-class Englishman, Archibald Jones, and a deep-thinking, serious Bengali Muslim waiter, Samad Iqbal. The two first meet inside a tank in the waning days of World War II. They then reunite thirty years later in North London, two unsuccessful middle aged men living out their lives in O'Connell's Poolroom, \\"an Irish poolroom run by Arabs with no pool tables.\\" But while the stories of Archie and Samad anchor the narrative, their relationship is only a small part of this hilarious and deeply insightful novel. <br />Zadie Smith, in reviewing her own novel in the British publication Butterfly, described White Teeth as \\"the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing ten-year-old.\\" The amazing thing is that her description is accurate, for we get not merely the story of the unlikely pair of Archie and Samad, but also many other amusing and intersecting stories, all of them driven by the clash of culture, belief, race, traditon, lineage, and science which forms the turmoil which marks London, and all of the Western world's major cities, at the millenium. We get the story of Archie's young Jamaican wife, Clara, and of Clara's mother, Hortense, a devout and rapturous Jehovah's Witness. We get the story of Samad's turbulent relationship withhis wife, Alsana, as well as Samad's struggle to raise his two twin sons, Millat and Magid, in the face of a materialist culture that pervades and undermines traditionalism of all kinds. We get the story of Marcus and Joyce Chalfen, one a geneticist and the other a pop horticulturist, and their son, Josh. The Chalfens are unstintingly secular, scientific and self-centered celebrants of their own ideology of \\"Chalfenism\\". Finally, we get the story of Irie, the awkward daughter of Archie and Clara, who winds through the novel, its characters and situations, searching for an identity in the tangled history of her Jamaican past and the crowded cultural stew of her North London present. <br />In Smith's words, capturing the essence of her novel in a couple of sentences: \\"It is only this late in the day that you can walk into a playground and find Isaac Leung by the fish pond, Danny Rahman in the football cage, Quang O'Rourke bouncing a basketball and Irie Jones humming a tune. Children with first and last names on a direct collision course.\\" <br />While Smith's narrative energy dissipates somewhat during that latter part of the novel, \\"White Teeth\\" is still the best first novel to be published in a long time.  Read it, enjoy it and look forward to many more novels from this brilliantly funny young author.
B0000029DD|5.0|This a great album. I bought it a few weeks ago. but I'd heard it before. The first song I've ever heard from Jeff was Hallelujah. I liked it so I borrowed the album from a friend. And I was a little dissapointed. but after a few listenings it grew on to me. And it still gets better each time I'm listening to it. I don't know where it's gonna end. Another great thing about this album is that it got sold by Jeff's hard work, because of his constatly touring. This man lived for his music and still is a great inspiration to new alternative bands such as starsailor, arid and lemon.
0140430350|5.0|William Makepeace Thackeray subtitled &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, his masterful comic novel, &quot;A Novel Without a Hero&quot;. But while this big, baggy eight-hundred page monstrosity of comic characters and situations may lack a hero, it has two of the most memorable characters in English literature: Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp. The contrapuntal, shifting fortunes of these two women drive the narrative of this big book, painting, along the way, a brilliant satirical portrait of English and European society at the time of the Napoleonic wars. <br />We first meet Amelia and Becky in the opening pages of the novel, leaving Miss Pinkerton's School for the wider world of fortune, love and marriage. Amelia Sedley, the naive, sheltered daughter of a rich London merchant whose fortunes will dramatically change over the course of her life, &quot;was a dear little creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which (the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort, that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a person.&quot; In contrast, Becky Sharp, the impoverished orphan of an artist and a French opera singer of dubious repute, was a calculating, amoral social climber. &quot;Miss Rebecca was not, then, in the least kind or placable . . . but she had the dismal precocity of poverty.&quot; <br />From the opening pages, Thackeray captures the reader's interest in these two characters and carries the reader through marriages, births, deaths, poverty, misfortune, social climbing . . . even the Battle of Waterloo! While Amelia and Becky wind like a long, contrasting thread from the beginning to the end of this story, there are also plots and subplots, intrigues and authorial asides, and one character after another, all of this literary invention keeping the reader incessantly preoccupied and enthralled. Reading &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is the furthest thing from &quot;killing time&quot; (as the dusty, misguided literary critic F. R. Leavis once said); it is, rather, the epitome of the nineteenth century English comic novel, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
B000002IQW|5.0|Far heavier and better than the 1st album. This isnt pop-metal. This is just metal. Great songs with balls. If you like this one check out Sword - Metalized, Spread Eagle, Armored Saint and Nightmare - The Darkside. All heavy and angry with good hooks.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Despite the fact that this DVD fails to deliver in the way of \\"extras\\" or even a chapter select option, I can't bring myself to give it anything other than five stars.  It earns my highest possible recommendation solely on the strength of the film itself.    David Lynch has outdone himself.  He continues to enthrall and mesmerize.  I've finally figured out why I love his movies so much:  they're not predictable, an unheard-of feat in today's dismal industry of overhyped, manufactured commercialism and tired formula filmmaking.    Mulholland Drive is a tale of the classic Hollywood Dream gone horribly awry.  It drips with mystery, style, and eroticism.  Its dizzying complexity and unorthodox structure have led many to dismiss it as pretentious arthouse fluff.  However, once the layers of cryptic, sophisticated storytelling are recognized and unravelled, the story is remarkably solid and explains itself completely.    The stunning and divine Laura Harring seamlessly pulls off the split role of Rita/Camilla.  But the real wonder is watching Naomi Watts convince us at the beginning that she's a lousy actress... and then proving us dead wrong.    For those who have yet to experience Mulholland Drive, I will simply say to watch and prepare to be amazed...
0920668372|5.0|A friend of mine gave this book to me while I was my mother's caregiver shortly before she passed away. It became, in a sense, my biography. I was a six-year-old boy tucking his mommy into bed.<br />A delightful read for anyone, not just the recommended 4 to 8 age group, this book has many layers to it that will appeal to all age groups. Although one reviewer here wrote that the book promotes codependency, I disagree. It merely illustrates the connection between mother and son. Certainly the boy tries his mother's patience, as all children surely do, but she loves him despite his impertinence, and the book's simple statement is that a mother's love for her child never stops. That the boy, now grown, returns to his mother on her deathbed, holds her and sings to her the song she sang to him as a youth is a tribute to her parenting. What greater comfort than for a mother to hear \\"love you forever\\".<br />Heraclitus wrote, \\"All things flow, nothing abides.\\" But life is a circle, and I now bear she who once bore me. So long as I live, so will my mother. This book remains on my bookshelf, and I pull it out every so often to read it, and it still brings tears to my eyes.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  The heroes are heroes and the villians are villians.  And good triumphs over evil.   That may sound trite to the modern liberal, but feh to them!   None of the filth and foul language, none of the political commentaries, none of the stench of today's movies.   Others have tried to protray Robin Hood, but there is only one real Robin Hood.... and that's Errol Flynn.   I first saw this film as little boy in 1948, and made my aunt bring me back three more times that summer; I still watch it at least twice a year.   Each time I see it I love it more than the time before.
B00005RY7X|1.0|I get wet when your dying? What the hell does that mean. This is they worst thing in rock music right now. Not to mention it has some wierd twist of hip hop culture. I heard the British press thought this was a good album, but they also thought Coldplay was the next radiohead. So lets not get a party started.
0345440757|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book and author.  Parents don't need to spend [money] on what to do - just listen to your inner voice and to your child.  It's sad that we, as parents and women, have such little faith in ourselves that we have to turn to these so called experts.  <br />What are Ms. Hogg's credentials - there are not listed anywhere in the book.  Her information regarding breastfeeding is just wrong and she calls babies who feed \\"on demand\\" demanding - simply wrong again.  The term should be \\"feed on cue\\" and this is way of baby feeding is endorse by many national and international pediatric organizations.  Wrong again, Ms. Hogg.<br />If you feel the need to buy a book on this topic, buy anything by Dr. Sears, especially his \\"Nighttime Parenting\\" - wonderful!  His credentials including being a pediatrician and a father to 8!

B0000636UN|4.0|It's been four extremely long years since Sheryl Crow's last studio album, the phenomenal \\"The Globe Sessions\\". She's back with \\"C'mon, C'mon\\", an ode to classic rock and summer fun. More polished and produced than TGS, and a tad less melancholy, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" is packed with tunes that urge you to crank up the volume and hit the road to the beach. <br />The opening track, Steve McQueen, takes a fun poke at current music trends (\\"all our pop stars look like porn\\") and kicks the CD into high gear. Next up is Soak Up the Sun, an infectious pop tune that tells you Crow still wants to have some fun. You're An Original, a thinly gauzed look at rock stardom egos is good fun, especially with guest Lenny Kravitz. Rock goddess - and frequent Sheryl collaborator - Stevie Nicks shows up for C'mon, C'mon, an intense rocker that makes great use of the two greatest female voices in music. The intense Safe and Sound, (which appeared in live form on the \\"America: A Tribute to Heroes CD\\") is one of Sheryl's most haunting songs to date. Don Henley contributes to It's So Easy, a slow burn look at love. Over You, which just might turn into a sleeper hit, struck a chord with me instantly. Lucky Kid is fun, fun, fun and promises to bring the house down in live performances. Stevie shows up again for Diamond Road, probably the most optimistic song on the album. Sheryl took a chance and recorded It's Only Love, a song that appeared on Stevie's incredible \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" last year. It has been re-crafted into a harder edged, but still vulnerable, rock song. Abilene picks up the pace, with guest Natalie Maines. Hole In My Pocket is an effective rock tune, though probably my least favorite on the CD. The disc ends with the crown jewel of the disc, the  incredibly moody Weather Channel. Nobody does sad songs like Sheryl Crow, and this one, like so many before, comes from a place deep in her soul that shows us how brave she is to share. Guest Emmylou Harris is a perfect companion to Sheryl.<br />As a Sheryl Crow fan, I found \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" an incredible gift. It's a true celebration of music, with some of the legends of music joining in on the party. So C'mon, C'mon! Get the latest from Sheryl. You won't be disappointed!
0140177396|4.0|I had to read &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; for a lit. project in school, and I really was not looking forward to it.  But as I read more and more into the book, it got better and better.  I haven't read very many books in my life, but this has been the best so far.  I loved everything about this book, the characters, the plot, the setting, and some of the themes.  It had all Five elements to make a great story.  From beginning to end, it seemed to keep getting better and better.  I would suggest this book to everyone, you will love it!
B000002KKS|5.0|I make no apologies for giving this five stars. If I could I'd give it a whole galaxy of stars. To the blinkered, the tunnel-visioned and the anally retentive zealots who are even now spluttering `Five stars to a Sabbath post-Ozzy? Heresy. Blasphemy. Anathema. Insanity.\\" I say `Bollocks'. Take your prejudices and your narrow-minded bigotries away from me, I have my own and I don't need the added load of yours. The last time someone presumed to dictate to me what I should and should not like it was my father (come to think of it Black Sabbath started that row too) and at fifteen I needed a place to live so I caved. Admit it. Deep down don't you secretly like Ronnie's voice better than Ozzy's? Isn't `Heaven and Hell' a little easier to get your teeth into than `Volume 4'? Don't get me wrong I give way to no one in my devotion to Ozzy - the man's a legend, an icon - but just as he went on to grow and thrive away from the shadowy burden that the band had become for him they discovered a new vitality and hunger in themselves as this proves. The songs from the epic `Neon Knights' the mythic storytelling of `Children Of The Sea' and right through to `Lonely Is The Word' are powerful and well-crafted and show the band had lost none of its creative drive or edge. Martin Birch's production on this is like a breath of fresh air too. The cobwebs had been blown away and there is an energy and vibrancy here that we hadn't had from Sabbath since `Sabotage'. They had nothing to prove to us they owed us nothing, their first six albums had more than fulfilled their debt to us but this was a bonus and an affirmation that while things change and people move on there's no reason why that can't be a positive step.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is really a remarkable CD. It runs a little long, but the songs are simply stunning. Madonna is the first artist to really melt techno and pop music together successfuly, and the album has spoken for itself thru the grammys et. al. The standouts are &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;The Power of Good-bye,&quot; &quot;Sky Fits Heaven,&quot; &quot;Drowned World,&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; Pick it up---a good listen
B000002KFJ|5.0|I suppose if I were to be pushed I'd admit to a leaning in the direction of the `Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' faction as to which is the best of the classic six Black Sabbath albums. However there is a certain need, a certain urge deep down that only one album can satisfy and it is this one. This is the album I reach for again and again when I want `heavy' - and when I say heavy I mean a solid lead cosh of sound around the head. The sheer variety and versatility of it takes my breath away. It has it all, classic Sabbath hard and heavy riffs in `Hole in the Sky'  and `Symptom Of The Universe' but also that innovative edge, that fearless tendency to explore the outer limits and push the boundaries just a little further in the outrageous and audacious `Supertzar'. They could unashamedly pull a commercial hit out of the bag too - `Am I Going Crazy (Radio)' yet in no way compromising their hardcore image, no mean feat in itself. In retrospect there's a sort of bittersweet irony that this should also mark the beginning of the end for Ozzy and the band -nothing they produced after this in the seventies could even approach it for quality and content.
B000002MUW|5.0|Out of all Madonna's albums, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is probably her most cohesive set. Though all of Madonna's releases are excellent, some of her albums ran a bit too long (&quot;Ray of Light,&quot; &quot;Erotica&quot;) or were a little patchy (&quot;Music&quot;). &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; doesn't have either of those problems. It is a sweet, seductive listen all the way through. Every song has a place, and each stand out on their own while contributing to a beautiful, lush sound.<br />&quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; are featured here, two of the biggest and most memorable hits of her career. But besides the blockbusters, the LP contains some amazing tunes. &quot;Survival&quot; is ferociously catchy, &quot;Inside Of Me&quot; is haunting and heartbreaking, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; and &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot; are exquisite ballads, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; prove that she had her eye on techno way before Orbit entered the picture, and &quot;Human Nature&quot; is the bitchiest song anyone's ever done. This is really an incredible CD. No Madonna collection is ccomplete without it, and even casual fans will find it irresistible.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Being a Gloria Estefan-atic, I had heard of Shakira some time ago but refrained from investigation (there can only be one Latin-Queen in my book, I used to say). I was pleased when I heard Shakira was releasing a record which contained Gloria & Emilio Estefan collaborations, & regarded listening to Shakira not so much as a betrayal but as showing support to the Estefans.  How sad!!! I'm glad I did, 'cos this album delivers not quite what you expect from a blonde bombshell with a great body & belly-area.  Shakira's voice & creative input into her MUSCIAL persona leave a lot to be admired - these two elements are what distinguish her most from Britney / Mandy / Jessica / Christina comparisons.  Laundry Service is not a pop-sounding album, but rather combines the most essential essences of Columbian rhythms (best demonstrated by the uber-smash Whenever Wherever & the merengue of the album's opener Objection (Tango) & original rock instrumentation.  Both these trax enable Shakira's guttural voice to cover some textured styling.  V. nice.  Add to that the new Celine-type smash Underneath Your Clothes, which caresses you with its powerful lyrics & voice.  My fave track is Ready For The Good Times, which is by far the most accessible (pop) track on the disc.  There are quite a few slower type songs, which allow Shakira to confidently display her vocal prowess.  Add to that all all songs have Shakira's pen & that the album was entirely produced by her, do you appreciate that this young lady, despite her deceptively beautiful appearance, is brains ahead of the crowd in determining her status & longevity.  A mighty forray into Anglo-recording which shall catapult Shakira's star.
B000021YQV|4.0|There are a few CD's out there that are able to be played when you want loud, loud, I mean frikkin loud music.  You know the kind to take out some agression, or just to get pumped.  Rage Against the Machine was the original LOUD CD, but I think Toxicity might be its equivalent.  This CD is excellent.
B00005NW02|4.0|I bought this album after seeing the &quot;Toxcicity&quot; video on MTV2.  I had known a few of System of a Down's songs, but after I heard this song, I really liked it.  I must admit, I'm a little dissapointed in the album overall, but nonetheless, I enjoy listening to it.  I love the songs Chop Suey, Atwa, and Toxicity. Those songs made the album well worth buying.  The other songs, however, all sound alike, but are okay to listen to.  Despite this, I do not regret buying this album.  Be your own judge.
0780622650|4.0|As someone who watched the original series as a kid I thought this was a very credible updated version.<br />And it certainly had beter characterization of all the women.<br />Matt Le Blanc was excellent as the new Don West and his scene with Mark Goddard, the original West, was really amusing for fans of the original show.<br />People complain too much about movies these days and this film was no exception to that unfortunatly.<br />It was so far and a way better written, acted and looking than the original partialy because of all the media advances over the last 30 years but also because it is just a great cast.<br />Gary Oldman was more true to how Dr. Smith was in the originals pilot than how he became as the series progressed.<br />SPOILER follows:<br />I loved this film and the only major problem I had was that it ends in a cliff hanger with them still Lost In Space! Arghhhh I know they probably hoped for a sequal or two but ooh how iratating, now both family Robinsons have yet to get home!!!!<br />:-D
0446525537|5.0|The narrator of this story, 57 year old Landon Carter, begins this story by stating \\"When I was 17 years old, my life was changed forever\\". It's hard to appreciate the full impact of that statement until Landon tells us, through the eyes of his youth, the details surrounding that year of his life. Landon promises us that \\"you'll laugh, then you'll cry\\", and he's absoloutely right about that.<br />This is the story of a young man who grows from an immature adolescent into an adult during that year of his life, mainly due to the influence of a young lady. This young lady (Jamie Sullivan) is not popular with the teenagers in her town, and for that matter, she doesn't care what others think about her. She's a minister's daughter who lives her life according to the teachings of the Bible, and she has a strength of character and maturity that is scorned by her peers. As Landon gets to know Jamie after they are thrown together as actors in a play, he experiences living in a way that changes him right down to his core.<br />The best thing about this book is how Nicholas Sparks tells the story through the eyes of a 17-year-old. The thoughts and feelings of Landon Carter are about what you'd expect from an immature teenager. But as the story goes on, you can see a change in the narration as Landon himself goes through a change. I've always loved the book \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", because Harper Lee convincingly tells an adult story through the eyes of a child. This book accomplishes a similar goal, even though this book is not of the same caliber as Mockingbird.<br />This book will grab your attention within the first 20 pages and hold tight right through to the end. The ending will knock you over, so be prepared.<br />This book shows the importance of following what you believe is right, regardless of the cost. Jamie Sullivan is a person of the highest character and integrity, and should serve as a role model to any teenager (or adult) who reads this book. I highly recommend it to all except the most cynical people who think there is no value in teaching that there can be true goodness in this world.it to all except the most cynical people who think there is no value in teaching that there can be true goodness in this world.
B000063UR2|5.0|I am looking forward to seeing this directors cut. I have correction to make from a couple of prior reviewers.<BR>1. The Goldsmith score was the original score. Tangerine Dream was an addition after the fact. Personally I prefer it to the Goldsmith which doesn't have the same dark or magical feel to it that the TD score does.<BR>2.The chopped up edit job was actually Ridley Scott's own fault. he was totaly parnoid about how this film would be recieved and went way too far in chopping it up.<br />Like I said I cannot wait to see the new version, I just wish they could done a compilation of the best of both soundtracks instead just the Goldsmith score.
B000063TNH|3.0|I thought Traffic was a teriffic movie with a great director. I went out and bought the dvd righht away. But it pisses me off by how so many studios make a normal dvd and then months later come out with a special edition dvd. If you don't have it already buyt the movie, it's great. But big guys in hollywood, stop making multiple dvds!
B00005RYP7|2.0|Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and her 11 year old brother and sent to to live with The Glass family after their parents die in a car accident. Things get creepy right away, as Mr. and Mrs. Glass's veneer of friendliness begins to fade away and their true colors appear. Mr. Glass seems to have more than fatherly intentions towards Ruby and Mrs. Glass is a drug addict (although she says she is a diabetic...uh-huh, sure..) They are far from the compassionate caretakers they pretend to be and their motive is greed- pure and simple. The children have inherited a fortune and the Glasses need money. Badly.<br /> Unfortunately, the promising setup falls flat. Leelee Sobieski, a capable actress in other movies, is sorely miscast in this one. Her continually sullen dimeanor makes it hard to warm up to her. In fact, no one in this movie is particularly watchable or likeable.<br />  Evem worse the plot has more holes than a sieve and isn't scarey as much as it is just plain silly. If you're into architecture, however, you will love the Glass's house. It appears to be made entirely of glass (the Glasses live in a glass house, get it?) and it is truly breathtaking. I would have enjoyed a 2 hour video tour of the house instead of the time wasted watching the movie.
B000066C6Z|5.0|There is only one word that can describe this movie: UNBELIEVABLE!! Best comedy ever written...The more you watch it, the more you find things that you hadn't mention before. A must-have for a serious DVD collection.
B000000WJZ|5.0|There's just something about the way &quot;Today&quot; explodes in your ears! Starting with James Iha's simple, quiet, melodic plucking and then the song just comes blasting into the great wide open, it's like going from black &amp; white to brilliant technicolor in a few brief seconds! This is just one of many heartstopping, exhilarating moments on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and the past 9 years have been especially kind to the wonderful music Billy Corgan &amp; Co. recorded back then. At the height of grunge when everyone else only knew 2 modes in music; angry and brooding, The Smashing Pumpkins actually recorded HAPPY sounding music, with actual melodies, hooks and full-length guitar solos! The rare thing about &quot;Siamese....&quot; is how it balances the bone-crunching riffs of heavy metal, the sprawling, psyhedelic sensibilities of 60's rock and the glorious guitar slendor of 70's art rock, all without sounding pretentious. This is a wondrous album to listen to in one long sitting. Give it some time and serious attention.<br />A Masterpiece by a groundbreaking band.
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow's new album,&quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;--which took her 4 years to produce--is a really good CD. All the time she spent making it definitely paid off. I was thinking about giving it 4 stars,because there are a few songs that should have been tweaked or left out alltogether--but the number of good tracks,such as &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;You're an Original&quot;(w/ Lenny Kravitz),surely outweighs the number of not-so-good tracks...so it scores a 5. Despite some of the negative reviews i have read about this album,it really shows that Sheryl Crow can still create good music with a good voice. Anybody who has liked her past work,will definitely enjoy her new stuff. Hope her next album doesn't take another 4 years to come out though! Check it out-
B0000636UN|4.0|Imagine taking a 1972 Camaro, putting a Corvette Z06 enigine in it, and having everyone from Richard Petty to Mario Adretti to help you tweak it.<br />Well?  That's what Sheryl Crow has done on C'mon C'mon.  She lifted a few classic rock hooks from the Allman Brothers to Steve Miller and built her own definitely Sheryl Crow tunes around them enlisting the help of everyone from Don Henley to Lenny Kravitz to pull it all off.  <br />Songs that for all there backward looking hooks still have that quintisential Sheryl Crow songwiting stamp of Sheryl at her most introspective and chord striking like, for example, her song off the Globe Sessions, &quot;The Difficult Kind&quot;.  <br />Put all those things togeether and you get an album (&quot;album&quot; is the work not the format, the format is LP{vinyl}, CD, or cassette)that even though is a little on the lighter and fluffier side than we might be used to from Sheryl Crow, still has that New Car Smell.
B00000HZH7|5.0|The title said it all. No words can actually justify this release. One of the many pioneering Heavy bands of the 80's along with Death, Pentagram(Chile), Slaughter(Canada), Sarcofago (Brazil), and Dark Angel, just to name a few. Bands that paved the road for modern day Death, Thrash, and Black Metal Bands. Especially Possessed, they totally invented the whole Death Metal genre with their debut \\"Seven Churches\\" and even contributed to the now modern day Black Metal genre. Every Extreme Metal band OR fan will automatically tell you that \\"Seven Churches\\" is one of their many favorites. I know it's definately one of mine! Just go ahead and fork over the 16 bucks for this classic Metal album. Possessed are classic!!!
B000065U1N|5.0|Other reviewers have correctly praised this movie for various reasons and I certainly do not wish to be redundant so let me now suggest why I admire this movie so much: It is among the very few war movies which enable those who see it to be &quot;there&quot; with the troops while they are directly engaged in mortal (sometimes fatal) contact with their enemy while enabling the viewer, at the same time, to have a perspective on the carnage which the troops themselves do not have. Sometimes we seem to be in one of the helicopters, suspended above the action; other times, we feel as if we are tagging along from street to street, never knowing if or when....<br />The production values are outstanding. The faces as well as the thoughts and feelings of those involved are almost always concealed. The plot does not so much develop as it evolves. The lucky ones escape and we accompany them, relieved and weary. The film ends, the credits roll, and then the house lights come up. We have &quot;been there&quot; but remain uncertain where the &quot;there&quot; is. This is a unique and compelling human experience. As with other war films such as Castle Keep, I am still struggling to understand what it all means to me. Was it all merely a dream or something more?
B000001DYY|5.0|I admit that I was quite biased against TFF when this LP was first released, I wanted them to be the same tuneful yet brooding hitmakers they'd been in the 80's. How silly of me! For along time I thought Roland Orzabal and his cohorts couldn't possibly produce anything nearly as brilliant as &quot;The Seeds Of Love&quot;, but the joke is on me. This terrific collection of songs is one of their strongest releases ever and a permanent part of my collection. The only real hit here is also the best song, the walloping, epic sweep of &quot;Break It Down Again&quot;. This towering track is reason alone to buy this album, for it will lead to the melodic splendor of &quot;Cold&quot;, the gorgeous, ambient title track and the lyrical whimsy and lighthearted touch of &quot;Brian Wilson Said&quot; (nice semi-tribute). A very rewarding album that grows on you with repeated listening.
B00005JKED|4.0|My opinion of this film was much higher immediately after seeing it than it was several days later. I share others' praise of Washington,  &quot;out of character&quot; given the roles in his most recent films but consistent with the rage and cynicism he portrayed in Glory; and of Hawke whose growth and depth of talent continue to reveal themselves. I thought his was (by far) the more difficult of the two lead roles in this film. However, upon subsequent reflection, so many of the specific situations throughout the day into evening seem to me implausible and some of them gratuitous. For various reasons, other films such as The Friends of Eddie Coyle, The Professional, and Thief are even more impressive now than they were when first released. I doubt if that will be true of Training Day. I am glad that I saw it, I am happy for Washington who received a second Academy Award for his performance, but will probably not make an effort to see this film again.
B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory is my absolute favorite band, always have been, next to a few others quality bands, Fear Factory always stands out with the most quality, talent, and determination to make some of the most agressive but intelligent music around...Whenever I first listened to Demanufacture, I was going through a very dark time in my life, not going to go into details, but whenever I first heard 'Demanufacture\\" it struck a nerve. The rush of infinite space and down to a Blade Runner-like future of Earth, with a sense of A.Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" atmosphere, \\"Demanufacture\\" is just by far one of the best albums about humanity's bleak future. The songs themselves are filled with a perfect mix of agression and melody. The first thing that stuck me most about this band was Burton C. Bell's voice. Never had I heard so much passion in a singer's voice since say....Mike Patton of Faith No More. I could trace all kinds of influences ranging from early agressive Godflesh and Napalm Death mixed with the more melodic parts of Loop and Head Of David. In fact the song \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\" is a Head Of David cover which is just as good as the original as the original from their \\"Dustbowl\\" album. Another thing that struck me was Raymond Herrera's drumming skills. This guy is very talented in fact one of the best Metal drummers around. He can go from a slow Police-like drum beats to insane double bass that can be match up with Pete Sandoval of Morbid Angel. Other than the two I just mentioned, Dino Cazeres and Christian Olde Wolbers are very talented musicians. Not to mention very good song-writers. The producer Rhys Fulber is a genius. The samples, techno effects, loops, not to forget the keyboardist Reynor Diego, are very well balanced giving it a perfect cyberistic feeling to it. The best songs here, IMO, are \\"Zero Signal\\", \\"Pisschrist\\", \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\", \\"New Breed\\", and the epic title track \\"Demanufactured\\". No Metalhead's or Music fan's CD collection should be complete without this album. Just go ahead and lay your [money] down for an amazing album!
B00005KHL0|5.0|I first saw Halloween when I was a wee girl and can remember so clearly being beyond terrified and running to jump under the covers with my dad. The next day I popped it into the VCR and sat smack down in front of it, absolutely entranced by the eerie music and the jack-o-lantern glowing with evil. I am a huge horror fan and not a single one I've seen can even compare to this masterpiece! This movie is perfect with everything: the scenery mostly with the creepy neighborhood and autumn atmosphere; then there's that white mask Michael Myers wears with the hollow, unfeeling eyes and no expression; next are the characters which are all perfection, I think. Dr. Loomis is so serious and obsessed with finding Michael that he drives such fear in us. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as the plain, responsible babysitter who won't believe Tommy when he tries to convince her that the bogeyman is coming after him that night; lastly there is that music. The heart-stopping, eerie, terrifying music. What else can one ask for in a horror film? Yes, there have been numerous slasher/stalker horrors made after this but \\"Halloween\\" was the one who began it all so it should get its much deserved recognition. The sequels to this movie are okay but somehow don't manage to set off the same spooky mood.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love this album.  It shows a growing maturity in Britney.  From the beat to \\"NOT A GIRL NOT YET A WOMAN\\"  to the sexy rythm of \\"I'M A SLAVE FOR YOU\\".  It doesnt matter whats going on with her and Justin as long as she stays the same [behind] kickin girl weve come to know and love!
B000060P79|5.0|This cd is full of explosive sound. Want to have a good time while listening to great music? Check out Simple Plan. They are the Simplan Plan to great pop-punk music today. Buy their CD... you WILL NOT regret it!
B00005JKEC|1.0|I rented this movie excited to see Denzel and his academy winning performance.  Instead of being entertained, I was bored to tears.  My husband only sat through half of the movie and he can tolerate anything!!!  I forced myself to watch it to the end and though it was a complete waste of time.  Yet, my sister watched the movie and loved it.  Everybody has their own opinions, ...
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Unlike movies which can have a love it or hate it review, this Baz Luhrmann's postmodernistic musical  <BR>soundtrack appeals to all who appreciates exotic European-style music with a twist. Stylish and expressive, it transcends me back to many dramatic scenes in the movie that is as memorable as spectacular. Nicole Kidman proved her vocal talents in tracks like \\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" and \\"One day I'll Fly Away\\". Composer/producer Craig Armstrong had given Parisian music new life which so complements both the soundtrack and the movie. \\"Come What May\\" is a great romantic number by both Ewan Mcgregor and Kidman, but of course the signature track is the remake of Bob Crewe's  \\"Lady Marmalade\\" appropriately  performed by 4 sexy mega pop artists  This musical in a packet will be one of the most listened - to  CD among  the rest and that's a promise.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I give this movie a 5 - what a bountiful sensory 2.5 hours! The surreal cinematography and the musical score took you on a ride that was like a tidal wave.  I wanted to give a personal thank you to the two leading actresses, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring, for their performances.  Together, they brought to the fabric of the movie a soft silk - which held up well to the sometimes harsh imagery in the movie. Bravo also to Naomi Watts for giving us the sweet character &quot;Betty&quot; who reverts to the &quot;Diane&quot; in reality. What a mind blower!  I've seen almost all of Mr. Lynch's movies - and liked them all.  But this one is more memorable - and definitely more womanly than his other films.   The actors believably navigate the depth of human emotion that Mr. Lynch intended.  I enjoyed the puzzles, clues and flashbacks -- its not intended to be doled out in nice, digestible pieces.  Mr. Lynch, please make more movies.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I plopped the CD into my changer and started to enjoy My Secret Life. Simply wonderful. I was listening to the other tracks, minding my own business, when the seventh track engaged. Alexandra Leaving was simply a breathtaking musical experience. Sitting in my car, listening to the track for the first time, I was instantly transported to the world of Durrell and to the poetry of Cavafy. I almost drove into a ditch. This is an amazing record. Buy it. Borrow it. Steal it. But listen to it when your attention isn't diverted by anything else. I hope you will soar. I certainly did.<br />In the larger scheme of things, waves of reasonableness can sometimes filter out from some intelligent person and give a little uplift here and there to an otherwise unbiased whole. For me, this CD was a tsunami of reasonableness...
B00005JKJA|5.0|I have read many reviews that have said Mulholland Falls is 3 different stories.  I beg to differ.  Mullholland Falls is infact one long movie and it all connects together.  I havd to watch it 3 times to understand it all but it is their.  For fanes of David Lynch it a entangling, engrossing story that follows you like a old soul.  <br />The first time I watched this movie I was dumbfounded.  I was confused... and did not understand.  But it held my interest and haunted me even after the final words were spoken.  So I watched it the second time and something clicked, so on and so forth.  So if you want a movie that makes you think and you love David Lynch, then buy this DVD and hold on cause you'll have the ride of your life!
B00004SCX6|5.0|But her best songs are here. The greatest Oops, Can't Make U Love Me, Lucky. I adore Britney's music, her wonderful voice. Well - it's just a part of life. <br />And I don't care what other people say (especially that one who hate this wonderful girl) about her. I still love her 'cause she's so beautiful, talented and... sometimes almost perfect. <br />Britney is one of the best pop-singers in present days. Maybe there's only one girl who is better than her - Vanessa Paradis. Sorry, Brit...
B000005ILF|5.0|As an educated musician and a music lover, I cannot understand some of the bad reviews given to this album. It certainly is a great recording. Sting's songwriting, is as always, excellent, and the song structures breathe maturity. The odd time phrasing of &quot;I Hung My Head&quot; is certainly a highlight. Some of Sting's most heartfelt and sad lyrics can be found on &quot;I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying,&quot; and some of his most earnest vocals on &quot;You Still Touch Me.&quot; As a drummer, I certainly am amazed by Vinnie Coliouta's expressive groove. This is amazing music, as is most of Sting's repetoire.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This album is very good because Shakira is talented with such a unique and strong voice. I do think her spanish albums are better.  If people know her just for the english album and like it, there's so much  more to her than that.  I would recommend picking up her older stuff then getting this one after.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album changed my life. It has everything, from the head banger of \\"Smells like teen spirit\\", to the catchy \\"Polly\\". But it's not just a great mixture of songs that makes this album great, all the songs are great. You'll find yourself singing lines from this album for days, and if that isn't enough, it's impossible to get bored of it.<br />I find that a song on this album can fit any mood that I'm in, and indeed lift me out of it. Kurt's immense songwriting ability is backed up by some superb bass runs from Krist, and Dave's drumming seems unbelievable at times.<br />I am, and always will be grateful to Kurt for his music, and it makes me sad when I think what the band could have achieved, and when I see the [stuff] that's in the top 40 today. Nirvana brought proper music to the 90's, and gave pop a kick in the face. RIP Kurt Cobain
B00005JLD2|5.0|This is a true story set in 1931 Western Australia, where white people stole half-aboriginal children away from their families and placed them into orphanages, hoping to force them into white society. Three young girls escape the orphanage and follow the rabbit-proof fence across the country, knowing that home is somewhere along it. The whole time they are being tracked.<br />This is an incredibly touching story that I think everyone needs to see. It is such a shame that this movie will not get the recognition it deserves outside of Australia, especially since America does not have a dissimilar past regarding Native Americans. <br />The three main characters in the film were girls from aboriginal tribes who had no previous acting experience, and they did a better job than most popular adult actors. I can not praise this film enough; I loved it so much, and knowing that it actually happened had an incredible impact on me. I don't think I'll come across a better film for a long time.
B00005JXZE|5.0|Another great Guy Richie flick, one of the best and funniest movies ive ever seen with a great cast.  If theres anything I did'nt like about it, it has to be Clark Collis' editorial review... i think anyone who enjoyed this movie would not hesitate to see another run like this and lock stock and two smoking barrels from Guy Richie... if you wanna benefit yourself and know you'll like it... it seems if that guy Clark gives it a wimpy review or denotes Guy Richie in any way, then you have to see it 'cause that person has no idea what he's talking about.
B00003CXI0|5.0|this movie is so cool! If you haven't seen this movie or read the books you should. It is based on the first of the Harry Potter books about a young boy born to wizard parents who were killed when Harry was just a baby and is forced to live with his evil cousins. Then he gets invited to Hogwarts where he faces many challenges and dangers as the evil Lord Voldemort attempts to kill him several times. Harry is willing to risk his life to have fun with his friends and be a normal kid. The acting is this movie is amazing. Daniel Radcliffe sure did an awesome job playing Harry. The movie is over 2 hours and 30 minutes, but easily could have been over 10 hours long if everything in the book was included.. Go out and buy this movie if you are a Harry Potter fan!
0451523938|4.0|The book begins with two men, Mr. Utterson and his cousin Mr. Richard Enfield, on a walk in London. Although the two men are initially silent, after passing a mysterious cellar door in a basement, Mr. Enfield launches into a strange occurrence that centered around the door. Late one night, while he was on his way home, he chanced upon a deformed, short man who trampled a girl in the street who was on her way to get a doctor. The girl's family and Mr. Enfield catch the mysterious man and instead of getting the police, they decide to blackmail him and force him to give the girl's family money. Agreeable, the mysterious man disappears into the same cellar door and comes out with a check bearing not his own name, but that of the respectable Dr. Jekyll. Surprisingly, the check was not a forgery. <BR>After hearing the story, Utterson returns to his home where he removes Dr. Jekyll's mysterious will, which he recently filed with Mr. Utterson. Jekyll's will stated that in case of his death, his substantial estate will pass to Mr. Hyde, but even stranger, in case of his disappearance for more than three months, Hyde will assume Jekyll's life without delay. He also realizes that the mysterious door is connected, in an L shape way, to Jekyll's home. Utterson decides that Jekyll is being blackmailed by Hyde and seeks to search to see his face in order to understand why. After tracking him down, he is initially civil but turns angry when Utterson proceeds in the conversation. <BR>One year later, Hyde murders Sir Danvers Carew with a cane. With help from Utterson, the police find Hyde's apartment ransacked. After leaving, Utterson proceeds to Jekyll's and confronts him for harboring a murder. Jekyll claims that he is done with Hyde and promises that he has nothing left to do with him. He does, however, have a farewell note from Hyde. Utterson examines the note and his clerk, Mr. Guest, later discovers that the handwriting from the note matches a dinner invitation written by Dr. Jekyll. Angrily, Utterson assumes that Jekyll has forged a letter for a murderer. <BR>More time passes, and we learn that although Hyde has not been located, Dr. Jekyll becomes more and more social until one day Utterson attended a dinner party at Jekyll's where Lanyon was present. Shortly there after, Jekyll secluded himself and Dr. Lanyon fell ill and died. After his death, Dr. Lanyon left Jekyll a letter than instructed him not to read it for ten years. After these mysterious events, Enfield and Utterson again walk by the mysterious door. Through one of the windows, they witness Jekyll having a frightening seizure through the windows of the cellar. <BR>About a week later, Poole, Jekyll's butler, approaches Utterson, who is afraid because Jekyll has locked himself in the basement and the only things that hear is strange sounds, including crying. The only communication that has come is letters desperately asking for a specific type of salt. Utterson follows Poole to Jekyll's house and breaks down a red cabinet where the body of Hyde is found. In the laboratory, the two discover a large envelope addressed to Mr. Utterson. Inside, Jekyll urges Utterson to read the package from Lanyon and if he wished to know more, read the further description that Jekyll provided within the envelope. <BR>Lanyon's narrative begins by describing a strange letter he received from Henry Jekyll, the night after a dinner party at Jekyll's residence. The letter urges Lanyon to go to Jekyll's house and get the contents of a drawer in the laboratory. Afterwards, a strange caller will come to Lanyon's house in Jekyll's name and recover these same items, powder, a phial, and a paper book. Lanyon does as much, thinking that Jekyll is crazy, and Mr. Hyde appears at the subscribed time. He gives Hyde the ingredients; Hyde mixes them into a potion, and after drinking it transforms into Dr. Jekyll. This shock, the pure evilness of the situation, was what brought about Lanyon's subsequent death. <br />After reading the account of Dr. Lanyon, Utterson then reads Jekyll's own account of his failed experiment. Jekyll believed that the soul is made up of two separate distinctions: evil and the good. These two separate beings live in continuous and inherent conflict with each other. Slowly, Jekyll begins an experiment where he makes two potions and transforms himself into Edward Hyde. Shortly after becoming Hyde, he drinks a second potion and once again becomes Henry Jekyll. This experiment begins Jekyll's exploration of his other self, a side that he freely explores and feels no remorse for the negative and evil actions of Mr. Hyde. <BR>For some months, this behavior continued until one moment, \\"I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde.\\" Alerted that the character of Hyde might irrevocably stay, Jekyll chose to give up the freedom of Hyde and for two months his decision held weight. Unfortunately, he was tortured with Hyde's longing and he once again took the potion and brutally murdered Carew. Because of the manhunt for Hyde, he swore this character off forever and set out to try to remedy the evil...it is an intriguing combination of fantasy and thriller and moral allegory, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde depicts the gripping struggle of two opposite personalities one essential good, the other evil - for the soul of one man. Its tingling suspense and intelligent and sensitive portrayal of man's dual nature reveal Stevenson as a writer of great skill and originality, whose power to terrify and move us remains, over a century later undimihnished
B00003CXXI|5.0|The movie Shrek is about a lonely ogre named Shrek who lives in a swampy village all alone. Shrek goes on a quest to save Princess Fiona (voiced by Camron Diaz). Accompanied by Shrek is a donkey voiced by the extremely funny Eddie Murphy. Shrek has to go to Lord Farquaad (voiced by the talented John Lithgow) to save the princess, but runs into many difficulties and obstacles along the way including a fight with a knight-in-shining-armor. When he gets to the castle he has to avoid a huge dragon and burning floors to get up to the top floor to save Princess Fiona. This is a great movie for any age that will be watched over and over and provide a lot of laughs.
B000002LEM|4.0|Well, it happens to the best of artists, and it too happened to Van Halen (or Van Hagar, depending on who you like better, Dave or Sammy).  On this, their second album as the &quot;new&quot; Van Halen, they admitted this time they wanted to spend more time in the studio laying down more overdubs, more &quot;layers&quot;, more, more, more.  What made 5150 so good is that it is pretty much what you hear, straight ahead asskicking with little thought.  This time around they really wanted to craft everything, from the lyrics on and I am not so sure it works.  There are still a couple of songs on hear I find myself wanting to hear, but not nearly as many as 5150.  Of all the Hagar albums, this is my second favorite I think.  Actually, they start with 5150 and go down from there (I am not sure I actually listened to Balance more than one time through).<br />The sophmore jinx is a terrible thing.......
B00004ZBVG|4.0|Perhaps, like me, you've come here after watching \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" featuring Owen Wilson and, of course, Gene Hackman, who happens to star in this underrated film.  Okay, the plot is almost the same as that action filck made with the technology of the year 2001, but, let me tell you, \\"BAT*21\\" gives its stress on a different matter than \\"Behind,\\" and that is the characters played by the two leads.<br />As the film claims in the opening, the story about Lieutenant Colonel Iceal Hambleton whose airplane is shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam is based on truth.  Now becoming \\"BAT*21,\\" his code name, he has to rely on a radio by which he maintains a contact with a pilot Captain Bartholomew Clerk (Danny Glover), who instructs and encourages him to overcome all the barriers waiting for him on the ground.  But Lieutenant Colonel has no previous combat experience in his career, and the time for massive air raid that is certain to kill him is coming closer.<br />Frankly, some of the scenes are too incredible (especially when Captain tries to fly the helicopter, which he has not done for a long time).  And you cannot expect the high-octaine action sequences, because the film's real focus is set in other places; that is, the bond between the two leading characters, which develops gradually through the unreliable radio contact.  Precisely this human part is the greatest asset of \\"BAT*21\\" of which quality is raised by the extremely superb acting by Gene  Hackman.  He is, as usual with any first-rate actor you name, the real energy with his depiction of toughness and frailty, and his powerhouse performance lifts this sometimes clithed film to the above-average level among many other ones about this war.
0790729725|1.0|The 2 reasons I buy my favorite movies on DVD are that they don't wear out and that long movies don't need to be interupted by putting in the other video tape.  Well, on Goodfellas one half the movie is on each side!  What a waste of DVD technology!  They need to correct this and rerelease.  That I would of course rate 5/5.

0451204530|3.0|Perhaps, his best work is Pillars of the Earth. It is unfair to compare this novel to that masterpiece. However, it would be nice if he returned to the level that he first accomplished in Eye of the Needle and Key to Rebecca. <br />This has become what I expect from Follett - an interesting story lacking compelling characters that I could ever care about. This books follows the same unfulfilling road traveled by previous works such as the The Third Twin and the Hammer of Eden.<br />The story centers around launch of Explorer I and the possibility of Soviet sabotage. I suppose I would have been more interested if Explorer were something more than an oversized weather baloon, but the Republic would have continued had the launch failed. The story moves along through subterfuge and deceit (some of it improbable).<br />His novels have become predictable in terms of character and format and pace. If that's what you want this is a tolerable read.

B00005Y7NK|4.0|This album is great - it's one of my favorites from Sabbath.Tony Iommi and Tony Martin hit their peak with this release, and the songs are heavy, dark, melodic - and brilliant!

B00005RY7X|5.0|There are two songs on this CD with the word party in the title and I think this is symbolic of why Andrew WK is so good. He stands for nothing but having fun and his music totally reflects this. I saw him live a little bit ago and his live show is the same way. It was possibly one of the highest energy shows I have ever been to. Start with the CD then go catch him live.
0156907399|2.0|To The Lighthouse was an ambitious, brave experiment in literature, a bold venture into stream-of-consciousness techniques and profound themes relating to the fundamental differences between the sexes.  It deserves to be recognized as an important contribution to 20th century fiction.  Alas, that does not mean that it deserves to be read.  It was far too tedious, and relied to a great extent on style and literary technique to drive it forward.  And while I rarely go searching for \\"an easy read,\\" nor do I seek out plot-driven novels, this book was simply too far towards the opposite extremes to be enjoyable.<br />The most highly regarded of Virginia Woolf's many books, To The Lighthouse focuses on the Ramseys, a British family in the 1910s and their interactions with family friends at their vacation home in Scotland.  I wish I could say more about the plot, but frankly, not much happens.  Oh, sorry, they keep talking about sailing out to the Lighthouse (and eventually they do, even).  But this book is not about plot.  It is about the emotional and philosophical ruminations of Woolf's characters, none of whom is particularly sympathetic or engrossing.  Woolf juxtaposes the rational, abrasive Mr. Ramsay with the pleasant, introspective Mrs. Ramsay in an attempt to make profound statements about the differences between men and women.  Woven into this central issue are the themes of love and art.  Perhaps this book was revolutionary when it was first written, but can it appropriately be considered timeless?  Given its limited appeal to even the most avid, intelligent readers of today, I think the answer is 'no.'

0783244320|3.0|Briefly, because the previous reviews cover it quite well, it's a good comedy. If you're looking for a good comedy to add to your collection, this would be it. It will span a number of years in your collection before someone asks....&quot;Galaxy Quest...what's that?&quot;<br />All the characters come to life in Galaxy Quest in a genre that often leaves one thinking...that character isn't real. Everyone will have a favorite, but Guy's interaction with the regular crew of Galaxy Quest is worth the price of the DVD alone, not mentioning the performances turned in by the rest of the cast.
0822216310|4.0|I picked up this book at the library after recognizing the title of &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot; from posters I had seen in downtown Pittsburgh at Christmastime. Figuring it would be a quick read, I borrowed it and started paging through it.<br />I don't think I ever stopped laughing.<br />&quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot; is a hilarious one-man play about the author's experiences working as an elf in Santaland at Macy's department store in New York City. Chronicling everything from his dismay at having to choose an 'elf name' to be referred to as, to his questionable co-workers (including profiles of all the Santas and the woman who desperately wanted to wear her costume home everyday), the quality of visitors, and his final relief at the end of the season, Sedaris has put together a brilliant piece of work.<br />I only regret that I missed the chance to see this performed at Christmastime, and hope that I have a chance to see a future show. It's worth a read, at the very least, and you may find yourself quoting it as I have (&quot;It breaks my heart to see a grown man dressed as a taco&quot; is one of my favorite lines, and I find ways to use it in conversation entirely too often). Great for a quick pick-me-up.

B00004SVID|4.0|Every true pink floyd fan should know about the greatest concert anyone could imagine for a century, the wall concert during which, a wall was built in front of the band while they played. the music is fantastic but the best about it, are the booklets included who contain several pictures from the concert and commentary by the band and the road crew. Issue the movie from the concert, another great moment in the history of rock'n roll, the album, the concert, the movie from the album, the live album, what's next, the movie from the concert... hurry up!
B000003TAR|4.0|It appears that this album was partially designed to re-introduce Nirvana to the \\"underground\\". Had they continued in the direction that In Utero suggests, they would have cult- statused themselves right off the radio. Though there are a few singles, they don't really fit with the rest of the album, which is a mood, and that is antagonistic. Signing on Steve Albini to record added to the non-commercial appeal, and you can see their admiration for the Jesus Lizard(whom Albini prduced frequently) bleeding all over this record. The result is interesting, a good document of a band who belonged to neither world that claimed them. The lyrics are horrible and inscrutable, and make little sense even when you do find out what he's saying, but so what. It is a music record, replete with the storm of passion and confusion that must have been part of Cobain's self imposed prison. I don't care that he's dead, and Nirvana and grunge will be little more than a blurb in rock history( although, if I think back, they did make rock cool again), nevertheless, I was intrigued by this record because of how unsettled it is.
0060955775|4.0|I have read only 2 of Paulo Coelho's books and I always feel inspired by the hidden content. I recommend this book and the Alchemist as well; I enjoy the simplicity of his writings and the underlying lessons that are revealed. These Messages linger well after you have completed the book.

B00004XPP0|4.0|These are the Star Wars films we cheered and hissed at the theaters when we were younger. Sometimes having the original is the best gift of all.
0385503954|4.0|The first half of the book was the best literature I've read in some time. Ian McEwan gives great descriptions of the personalities of major characters and their motivations. The second half of the book was good, just not as fabulous as the first half. Ending was a little weak. Left a few loose ends. I was enthralled all the way through and highly recommend the book. Ian McEwan is sensational.
B00000INEX|2.0|My son (6 months old)has loved watching Baby Mozart since he was about 2 months old. I decided to purchase Bach hoping for the same results. He doesn't seem as interested in Bach as he is with Mozart. There is too much of the creator's children in the video. Mozart is our favorite by far!
B00005S8FC|4.0|Since I bought this CD, I almost exclusively listen to it while I cook. Why, you ask?  Well, I am no music expert, so I don't have the highly critical perspective of some others who reviewed Gotan on this site.  I do know that I enjoy both french folk and techno, as well as south american dub.  Gotan marries these influences seamlessly. An accordion fleshes out the sound, taking what would have typically been purely electronic music and infusing it with three dimensional life. Most of the dubbed voices are in Spanish, providing that essential &quot;world&quot; flavor.  <br />It's a great disc to play when cooking because its so easy to get into its groove.  Pop it in, get to work, wait for friends to stop by, sit back with a glass of vino and just enjoy the company.  Gotan won't rouse your deepest musical senses, but it plays well just about anywhere.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter has spent his entire life with his relatives, the Dursleys, who try to make Harry feel as miserable as possible. But things change on his 11th birthday, when he finds out that he is actually a wizard, and is invited to go to Hogwarts, an enormous castle that is a school for wizards. At Hogwarts, Harry is surprised to know that he is a legend, and that everybody knows who his is. It turns out that Harry was able to [pull] out all of the powers of the evil Lord Voldemort when he tried to kill him after killing his parents, who were also wizards, when he was just a baby.  <BR>In Hogwarts, Harry makes friends in Ron and Hermione, and goes on in adventures around the castle with them, often getting into trouble in the mean time. Harry makes it on the Quidditch team, and becomes a Quidditch legend in no time. (Quidditch is a game that wizards play on their broomstick.)  <BR>Eventually, after all the fun, Harry and his friends encounter a deadly secret, which they will have to deal before its too late.  <BR> <BR>The movie is really good, the cast really know how to bring the Harry Potter story to life. The one downside I found to the movie is that it doesn't include everything from the book, which sort of makes sense, because if the movie went exactly the way the book did, the movie would last all day.  <BR>Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a good movie for people of all ages. All this talk going on about the movie being satanist is out of control. Any mature person over the age of 10 would know better than to base their beliefs on a fictional story.
0743216458|5.0|From the moment you pick up &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, you will not want to put it down.  The stories told by Ambrose of the men from E Company are awesome.  From being dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day, to being surrounded by Germans at Bastogne, to the end of the war, the book never stops.  If you want to learn about the most storied group of men during WWII, read &quot;Band of Brothers.&quot;
B00005RFAI|5.0|Far from your typical pop / R'n'B commercial mix , Pink's latest is an impressive effort, being one of those few albums you can listen to without skipping one single track : each one has its place, its own identity.<br />Upbeat highlights include Numb, a tight rock song, 18 Wheeler, your classic pop/rock anthem, Respect, whose lyrics are simply great, clever, fun and catchy, and of course the much overplayed but still rocking Get The Party Started.<br />Meanwhile, Pink also confides her personal experience, her thoughts, her feelings : Don't Let Me Get Me, Dear Diary, Family Portrait or My Vietnam are introspective cuts, filled with sincerity and served by Pink's powerful voice, never shouting, never falling into emotionalism.<br />Surrounded by Dallas Austin and Linda Perry, Pink ( who wrote most of the lyrics ) offers an almost perfect album : both fun and deep, original but not disturbing, always infectious and never boring .
B000003AEB|5.0|This is the the best album Snoop has ever made- hands down. When I first heard this album, I heard the intro when Rage was flowing<BR>I knew this album would be a classic. We all know that the singles like \\"Doggy Dogg World\\", \\"What's My Name?\\", and \\"Murder was the Case\\" were tight but the other songs like \\"The Shiznit\\" and \\"G's and Hustlas\\" definitely held their ground. This is one the reasons that this album is a classic. Another reason, is the perfection production of Dr. Dre. Although listening to it now, there is a lot of sampling from George Clinton. Another reason this album is a classic, are the guess appearences by Kurupt, Daz, Rage, Lil' Hershey, and more. In conlusion, if you looking for excellent lyrics, tight production, and a few but funny skits, check out, forget it, buy this album.
B00005NW02|5.0|The music speaks for itself.  It is awesome.  Each song is uniquely different and enticing, and anyone who says that it all sounds the same just doesn't get music at all...
B000059T00|4.0|This one-shot supergroup may not have lasted long, but they produced a solid recording here.  There are only six songs, which is as expected--with Eric Clapton and Stevie Winwood in the same group and the opportunity to showcase Ginger Baker's remarkable talents as a drummer, jams are certainly in order and Ginger does well in \\"Do What You Like,\\" the concluder.  The songwriting is dominated by Winwood, but Clapton contributes  his classic \\"Presence of the Lord,\\" which begins with a soulful verseline and then bursts into a potent guitar solo.  Winwood's \\"Sea of Joy,\\" \\"Had to Cry Today,\\" and \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" are all excellent, with pretty verselines accentuated by his high-pitched vocals and neat instrumental riffs.  <br />In fact, the only thing that stops me from giving this five stars (just barely) is that there are only six songs.  The jams show solid musicianship and worksmanship but don't blow you away.  However, do not let the uneven reception this album received deter you.  It is eminently listenable, and actually very relaxing, something just to put on and soak up when you feel laid back.  The songs are not mellow as in slow, but in texture Blind Faith is smooth-flowing solid rock.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N Roses shabanged into the music scene at the perfect time. Pop-metal and hair-metal bands of the 80's were taking total control. Poison, Whitesnake, and Motley Crue had taken the forefront. Then, this album snaked its way onto the charts and reared its ugly head, taking the rock n roll world by storm. See, Appetite For Destruction fullfilled a desire in the minds of people in 1988-89(when the album caught on). The album's topics weren't so nice and pretty, dealing with drug abuse, city life, and so on. That's what makes this album a classic for its time. Axl Rose's voice is in top form on this record, and his lyrics did go introspective and sensitive for \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" which, along with the anthemic \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" and epic \\"Paradise City\\" catapulted these rockers to superstardom. Although you can probably associate yourself with the three hits, all the other tracks on this album are worth a visit or two, or three, or...now you see my point. It's unfortunate that GNR were unable to top this album in future releases, because this album helped incite the grunge revolution of 1991-93 and changed hard rock/metal's future as we know it.
B00000I8BX|5.0|I love this CD. it is a showcase of excellent vocal and instrumental ability. The singer can sing, but he can also scream and growl. Musically it is very heavy, and the members of this band are also very talented. Fear Factory rocks when they are fast, and they rock when they are slow too. They are one of the best metal bands out there. They  also have an industrial element that complements their music very well. You must own this CD if you are a fan on metal!
B00005UK1F|5.0|Okay, first, fans of In the Woods will love this album considering it contains a few members from their brilliance. Second, if you thought EOS's Crimson was a long song, it isn't anything compared to the 60 minute masterpiece assembled here. There is never a dull moment in this album, which takes use of many different instumentations. There is also a cool prog feeling in certain points where an organ is utilized, kind of reminds one of old-school Amorphis. If you don't buy this album, I truly hope you don't call yourself a fan of metal or talented musicians altogether.
6305718903|4.0|This innovative horror has Patricia Arquette as Frankie, a hairdresser who suddenly starts experiencing the stigmata.  Eventually the Vatican gets to hear of it and send miracle detective Father Kiernan (Byrne) to find out if it's a true miracle.  Upon arrival it soon becomes apparent that this is no ordinary case: Frankie is experiencing more of the five wounds of Christ than any stigmatic ever has before and, anyway, she doesn't believe in God.<br />Obviously there's a lot of comparisons to be made to 'The Exorcist', but this is actually an entirely different movie.  For one thing, it's about as modern as any movie could hope to be, with techno music and electric photography.  Secondly there's a lot here to suggest that this isn't your usual horror.  Interestingly, rather than focusing squarely on Frankie's personal hell it also takes into accounts the Church as Father Kiernan discovers an elaborate conspiracy in the Vatican.  It turns out that Frankie is more than just a stigmatic but is trying to uncover the secret of an entirely new gospel, that of Jesus' own words.<br />This plot is not only controversial but incredibly interesting in a day when most modern horror movies merely ape their predecessors.  Here the hope doesn't lie in religion, in fact it's the exact opposite, with the Church being portrayed as a powerful and anything but benevolent force.  Doubtless this will offend many, although the concept is nothing short of original.<br />The acting is very good indeed as well, especially Arquette and Byrne as the two leads.  Plus, despite not being especially frightening, the violent scenes have been directed with great care, looking a lot more at Frankie than at the act itself.  It's not often that you can call a horror movie visually arresting.  Not only that, but it's good too.
B00005T30L|4.0|If you ever felt like giving the finger to the Pep Rally crowd, you should be able to relate to Enid &amp; Rebecca, two misfit teenagers armed with intelligence, caustic wit, and reverse snobbery to shield their real sensitivity and vulnerability.<br />A world unto themselves, they are aloof, cool &amp; cynical, floating detached through the Ghost World of inanity &amp; conformity they percieve around them, with youthful world-weary shrugs, rolling eyes, biting comments and sometimes cruel jokes.<br />When Enid (Thora Birch), the more cynical (and ultimately more vulnerable), of the two, decides to play a cruel joke on the writer of a Personals Ad selected at random, she eventually meets and gets to know Seymour (Steve Buscemi), and learns that there is more to him than her first superficial assessment allowed.  Their growing relationship and the resultant distancing of her friend Rebecca (Scarlet Johannsen) leads Enid to discover something about herself and other people, and the ultimately shallow satisfactions of unrelenting cynicism.<br />Rebecca will adapt and conform much easier than Enid ever will.  Enid is a true maverick and outsider, an artist in the making, she will find she will have to take the &quot;road less travelled&quot; and that it will make all the difference. Nicely done by the actors and director Zwigoff (on the heels of his excellent documentary, Crumb).
B00004X0ER|5.0|I was sure introduced in time. If you put all these new hyped bands together (Strokes, BRMC, etc), The Hives are probably the best, along with the White Stripes. Why? Because they sound fresh. So they may not be &quot;new&quot;, and they sound like the Stooges crossed with the Monkees, but who cares? It's still great. I love the mood of the whole record and I'm not sure if there's a favorite song; they're all GREAT. My new favorite band? Definitely worth the title, since they are w-a-a-a-y better than most punk bands out there. 'Veni Vidi VICIOUS' indeed.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Okay, you should know this isn't going to be Hamlet;  or Chinatown or Citizen Kane or whatever.  This is going to be simple adrenal kickay action about hot cars &amp;  hot chicks and that's about it!  On that level, this does not disappoint.<br />So, you get a BS story with some lightly sketched characters in a  hyper-kinetic flick (do they make any other kind anymore?); directed &amp; edited with the expected high energy and razzle dazzle techniques; some excellent stunt work done with some super hot cars driven by young hunks and babes.<br />As he proved in Pitch Black, Vin Diesel is a real screen presence; and hot cars, illegal drag races, and young studs &amp; their honeys are as American as Apple Pie and Rebel Without a Cause.  Fast, simple, and dumb...it's about the jolt, man!  Taken at that, s'okay.
B000003BEV|4.0|Ok, this is far from \\"Sticky Fingers\\" or \\"Exile on Main St.\\", but after all, it's the Rolling Stones and they're one of the best rock bands ever. Their psychedelic majesties request is classic and a great satire to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper. Most of their fans, however, didn't get it quite like that: they think it's a weak imitation of the fab-four classic record. May it be or not, the music is loud and trippy. The anthemic \\"Sing This All Together\\" starts off the album with a great chorus. Then we have Keef's guitar screaming in \\"Citadel\\", one of my favourite here. Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land\\" is not a TSMR highlight, but it's as acid as it can get.<br />But not until \\"2,000 Man\\" we know that this is remarkable rock and roll. The song is very up and Mick's singing is beautiful. Another masterpiece comes with \\"She's A Rainbow\\", one live favourite and probably the best song they did in this - together with, of course, \\"2,000 Light Years From Home\\", my personal preference, with great lyrics and a catchy chorus (\\"It's so very lonely, you're 2000 light years from home\\").<br />Despite \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\", which is experimental..., I love this album. A real RS fan's gotta listen this sooner or later - and perhaps non-fans will enjoy it too. It's just a question of open mind.
B00005O3VC|5.0|this movie is a must-see! It is so hilarious and it will keep you laughing through the wholeee movie! i love it so much that i watch it over and over again. still with the same laughs. the people who created this must be really intelligent to know really how to make someone laugh!
B00005LMBK|2.0|Gorillaz must be the latest proof that just about anything can sell nowadays: they are kinda cute cartoon characters, make silly childish songs and pretend to be changing experimental pop music. Good Ol' Fella Damon Albarn has done better efforts before - and I do consider myself a non-Blur fan -, so did Dan 'The Automator' (can you believe the same man produced and helped creating the Lovage project?), so that's worth the 2 stars they're getting.<br />Listening to the whole CD's just got me annoyed and thinking where Blur's frontman had his mind when decided to put this up: probably trying to irritate his pal Liam. By this time, our public enemy Gallagher #2 was doing some real rock music and punching photographers. How can somebody not go for that? Way to go, man!<br />So, unless you're a 3-year-old boy looking for some dumb music, buy yourself something else, like Smashing Pumpkins' &quot;Rotten Apples&quot; or Oasis' &quot;Hindu Times single&quot;.
B00005RY7X|4.0|First off, to all the people that complain about how this CD is simplistic and stupid both musically and lyrically, just don't listen to it. If you want musical talent, go listen to Yngwie Malmsteen or Iron Maiden (2 amazing artists, don't get me wrong). If you want lyrical comlexity, go pick up a Tool or Crass CD. While all those aforementioned artists are damn good IMHO, Andrew W.K. is different in his own way. I think the best way to describe it is to refer to a quote once made about the Ramones, &quot;You had to be smart to realize they weren't stoopid, but if you took them to seriously, you'd be missing the point.&quot; When you look at it in this context, the pieces of the puzzle start fitting together. I just hope that music historians look back and see this as the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; of 2002, a huge meteor, making extict all the nu-metal acts that try to sound smart and self-loathing while you know they're just spoiled ex-suburban rich kids still angsting out from the time their daddy didn't buy them that new car. Lets hope it also kills off all the meritless pop acts as well. We all know that probably won't happen, but what this album proves is that good acts stll do exist, and that's a relief. While this may not be thought-provoking or full of talented musicians, it's endearing in it's stupidity. There are no pretenses, no real aspirations, but goddamn, you have to recognise that the popular music world has been on life support since Kurt Cobain died. Lets hope this pulls the plug on it and lets it be reborn into what popular music used to be about, having fun.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I am a sixteen year old girl and in my opinion, the movie was good but it was not fully true to the book.  I went to see the movie two days after it appeared in the theater with some fellow fans and we saw everything that was not there and that was changed.  We noticed that there were some characters that were missing from the movie.  also, neville longbottom was supposed to be in detention with Harry potter, fang, Hagrid, hermione and malFoy.  <BR>      For the most part, the movie held true to the book but for the minor mistakes, I think j.K Rowling could have done something to help.  after all, she is very talented and I admire her for what she writes and the fact that she struggled before she became famous.  Keep writing Rowling and if possible, will there be another book after all seven just to explain what harry does after his years at hogwarts?  I hope so because I enjoy her writing.
1577311523|2.0|First of all I do think the present is very important and is where living takes place. I'm sure the authors are well-intentioned in writing this book. I always enjoy taking 'break time' when reading and during this time I've discovered some concerns I have with 'The Power of Now', please read below.....<br />1. While it may be true that living in the 'now' is the truest path to happiness, the 'now' is only meaningful in the context of the past and the future. Without true meaning, purpose, and hope, a meaningful 'now' is illusory.<br />2. Do some people live solely in the past or future and thereby ignore the present? Certainly.  But that does not mean that a proper time-context for the present should be abandoned? For instance a great amount of satisfaction can and should be taken for past accomplishments and past relationships. Additionally, looking forward to future goals and activities can provide a huge amount of satisfaction.<br />3. Our true identity is not merely our moment-to-moment experience, but is substantially shaped by our past and our future hopes. To ignore this or to pretend this is not the case is to invite delusion. Past memories and experiences do shape a person's worldview, and future hopes do affect current decisions. Living as if there is no future is not only hopeless, but it fosters madness.<br />4. If the future has no place in a healthy and peaceful existence, then the person who has just won the lottery should be just as content as the person who is sitting on death-row. The now is the now, and the now is not affected by past of future? That smacks in the face of common sense.<br />5. If being totally aware of ourselves at each moment means that we need to stop our thoughts, then the pursuit of truth should be abandoned. Why be concerned about discovering the truth in the future if all a person must do is convince oneself that the now is all there is?<br />6. It does seem possible to live a pain free existence by living fully in the present. However, is it worth it? Is it worth abandoning one's past, and ignoring one's future? These both are far to valuable to exchange for a pain-free life.<br />7. Some people may exclaim with great joy that 'all there is, is now', but is that true? Can it be liberating? Yes. Is it illusory? Yes. Is it worth it? No.<br />8. The author claims the humans are being trapped in a constant cycle of emotional illusions. This is exactly what Tolle is doing by promoting the illusion of a monistic view of the present.<br />9. While it may be true that some thoughts and emotions get in our way of living in genuine peace, that does not mean that all thoughts and emotions are negative. In fact, many thoughts and emotions contribute significantly to a fulfilling life. Unfortunately the author swipes too broadly and pushes all aside, instead of carefully and intentionally distinguishing the good from the bad.<br />10. The author is basically right in the conclusions of this book, provided there is no ultimate purpose in life, and that there is no future in which we can place our hope. However, if these premises are not valid, the conclusions are baseless.<br />In conclusion, a worldview that provides a true and good hope in the future, based on the reality of the past is much more effective at securing a true peace in the present. May that hope not be in vain.present. However, is it worth it? Is it worth abandoning one's past, and ignoring one's future? These both are far to valuable to exchange for a pain-free life. <br />7.

B00005RHGK|3.0|The first half of this movie is excellent with suspense and a even a scene where they make fun of old horror movies.  The introduction of the truck and the evil \\"thing\\" driving it was right on target.<BR>The problem is the 2nd half where we see what the evil character really is and the history behind it.  It just gets a little fake toward the end and seems to stretch and contort an otherwise good movie.  I recommend you see this movie as it does have some aspects of what a good horror movie should be.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Track 7, Alexandra Leaving, is - I think - the best single track Leonard has ever done. Musically exquisite, brilliant poetic lyrics, magnificent production. In the car I leave it on repeat -I never tire of it. Secret Life is another wonderful gem. Let's hope he backs up next year - it's been too long Leonard.
B00005BCPC|4.0|If you've read Jane Austen and seen the six part Pride and Predjudice from A&amp;E, and seen the BBC's faithful rendering of Mansfield Park from the mid-eighties, then you are probably not going to like this movie- at least initially. I thought it was terrible the first time I saw it. However, while this movie is NOT faithful to Austen, I think it does have at least one substantially redeeming feature that is consistent with Jane Austen stories: a satirical and intelligent sense of humor. So I think of it as not being Jane's voice, but perhaps being her laughter...
6305428425|4.0|Let's face it....if you like Lisa Kudrow, you'll love this movie...if you don't...then forget it.  Rent it, first, if you are worried about liking it...but, I guarantee you'll want to see it more than once.  Listening to Lisa Kudrow's (Michele) rendition of the lyrics to \\"Footloose\\" is nearly worth it alone.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a delightful book about a teenage boy who unexpectedly finds the love of his life.  This is a romantic story of a boy named Landon who grew up in Beaufort, North Carolina with the reverend Sullivan's daughter, Jamie.  The two grew up together; however, did not become friends until they had to do a school play together.  While rehearsing together, Landon discovers that there is more to Jamie than just being the reverends daughter.  With an unexpected ending, this book will leave the tender hearted with a tear in their eye a smile on their face.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but particularly teenage girls looking for a little bit of romance.
B000062Y98|2.0|I haven't been a totally dedicated Blind Guardian fan, but this band did spark my attention when I heard \\"Lord of The Rings,\\" the symphonic version as will as \\"The Wizard.\\" I was intrigued to see more of what this band was all about, however their roots appear to be speed/death mental, which is too bad. Nightfall in Middle-Earth is a testament to the path this group has taken, but I had not given up hope that this band might change their tone to something more mature, so I waited for this latest release, and what a disappointment. <br />I'm sure this group will/has satisfied some else's taste in music, but I think this is the end of the line for me. The CD has some good music points, but when the meat of the song starts, it sounds like the same `ol heavy drums, raspy vocals and guitars, basically no direction, just a snooze session at that point.<br />I suppose it took two years just for them to refine the loud obnoxious tone on this CD, I really don't see any other reason. Unfortunately I can't even point out a good song, my final warning is simply stay away.
B000002HPV|5.0|--- There is no other album like Homogenic.  Its certainly a product of the late 1990's.  All the typical elements of that time's avant-pop are there: jungle and trip hop influenced beats, esoteric instrumentation, a consciously post-modern splicing of musical genres, diva vocals, etc.  Yet even as this type of music has reached the point of tiresome cliche', Homogenic remains a fully rewarding listen half a decade after its release.  <BR>--- The synergy between Mark Bell's (of LFO) production, and Bjork's singing is nothing less than perfect. Imagine having an out of body experience in a mythical city of ice ,the eerie glow of the Northern Lights above, and you may have an idea of Homogenic's atmosphere.  Unlike Bjork's most recent album 'Vespertine,' the instrumentation here is never too precious or maudlin.  Icy string sections create an aura of austerity.  The beats are organic rather than clubby, functioning as heartbeats and evidence of life.  Yet it is an ethereal form of life that straddles the edge of human familiarity, and the glassy, chrystalline synthesized tones affirm this.  Bjork is at her best here.  Her songwriting is intimate, but also provacatively open ended.  The unifying theme is love in its many manifestations: romantic, possesive, life giving, hypocritical, and the mystical revelatory (or on E) love of the ecstacic 'All is Full of Love.'  Its true that if you've been raised on top 40 pop, Bjork's unique singing style may take some getting used to.  If you enjoy good music though, her otherworldly, heartfelt, and somewhat quirky delivery will eventually win you over.  <BR>--- The word 'dark' seems to be prolific amongst the reviews here.  To clarify, Homogenic is not dark in the mopy nihilistic vein of P.J. Harvey and Radiohead, as one reviewer maintained.  The darkness here is the kind that shadows someone who recognizes its existence but is seeking something greater.  Songs like 'Unravel', and 'All Neon Like', have a rare urgent beauty thatis  simply overwhelming, almost healing.  I can't reccommend this album enough.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|It is a shame, but this was so bad it makes you want to cringe.  I even think that the heroine might have some talent, but one does like plot, and to be quite honest mid-way through this drivel, I did not care what was going to happen next.<br />The good news for the producers is that the sequel cannot be worse.
B00005N919|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ROLES SHARON STONE EVER HAD I LOVED THIS MOVIE!WHEN I SAW THIS FOR SALE ON DVD I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT IT I TOUGHT THE ICE PICK THAT IT CAME WITH WAS A GREAT MARKETING TOOL.I WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO BUY IT.I HAD THE RATED VERSION ON VHS SO I DECIDED TO BUY THE UNRATED VERSION ON DVD TO SEE WHAT I DIDN'T GET TO SEE.THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOUR MINUTES IT WAS WORTH IT.EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS NOW IT IS AN AMAZING EROTIC THRILLER.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the the best Hamlet screen version ever made- there is no question- other films capture nuances and moments, but never has anyone else had the courage ( until the very good 2001 film version) to attempt to visualize the complexity, claustrophobia AND the scariness of the scope of the outside world of politics and human plight on the grande scale that is the very REASON for Hamlet's (as Olivier put it) \\"Indscisiveness\\".  This is the Hamlet for the ages, it is the whole Hamlet (despite a few flaws, like distracting cameos and an over-eager climax), and IT SHOULD BE ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!   WHERE IS THIS DVD?????!!!!!!
0871137380|5.0|Wow, this book will be the standard for combat reporting for maybe the next 20 years.  If the author gets royalties from each book that has on its dust jacket \\"just like Black Hawk Down\\", he will make a good living just from that.  If you are reading this review you probably have either heard about or seen the movie and now want to buy the book.  I have done both and the movie is very good, but it pails in comparison to this book.  The author has just done the most complete, detailed, tension filled true-life combat book there has been.   I can not say enough good things about this book nor do I have the skill to truly convey to you how excellent this book is.  Do yourself two favors - first buy the book, next lock yourself in a room and clear your calendar because you will not want to put the book down.
B000002A3T|5.0|I don't really understand all these negative reviews on this album.No, roger watters was of an abstance on this one as of previous albums beofore this one, but that alone should not deman this to be a bad album by any means. Of course when roger watters was present with the band for 20 or more some odd years pink floyd made some truely musical master peices, with out a doubt. This is my first pink floyd album, and has a speacial place in my heart. Also it has had a high roatation in my cd player coming up on 7 years already. One cannot deny that most of these songs are just beautifull and masterpeices on there own. So many thoughts to share with this album, so little time. As for the album, lets start shall we? of course. You get into songs like cluster one,what do you want from me,poles apart,marooned(an exceptional instrumental peice) with plenty of  emotion and one just by those songs get to once again see how remarkable of a guitar player david guilmour is. And what a really good voice he has, just as good if not even a little better than roger. Then you get into the second half of the album with songs like A great day for freedom,wearing the inside out,take it back, and coming back to life with it's astouding guitar solo. If your new to pink floyd, please do yourself a favor and pick up this album.
B00005JKED|3.0|I avoided seeing &quot;Training Day&quot; in it's theatrical release, because the trailers did not impress me enough to spend the money to see it at the theater.  I recently rented the DVD, and I was glad I waited.  The quality of the DVD was very good in picture and sound.  The movie itself was better than I expected, but not as good as it could have been.  I was more impressed with the special features, especially the background on the making of the movie.  This documentary was far more impressive in what the movie was all about than the movie itself.<br />Denzel certainly had his &quot;Day&quot; when he won the Oscar for his performance.  But it was really not deserved compared to some of his previous performances.  Ethan Hawke was the one who got snubbed.  His performance was far better.  Denzel's Oscar was more of a consolation prize due to the snubbing of Russell Crowe by his peers who really do not appreciate him as a person or may be very well jealous of his acting abilities.  So naturally, Denzel's win was the second best choice.  Don't worry Denzel, your &quot;Day&quot; will come when you actually will win because you out-performed everyone else!  I, personally look forward to that day, because you are one of the greatest.<BR>Unfortunately, &quot;Training Day&quot; was not one of your greatest.
0440211727|5.0|Will the black Vietnam Veteran, Carl Lee, who fought so that others might have democracy, freedom and justice, be able to acquire it himself or will he die in a hangmans noose?  John Grishams book, A Time To Kill, masterfully chronicles Carl Lees quest for justice when his eight year old daughter is raped, beaten, and left for dead by two members of the KKK.  Billy Ray Cobb and Peter Willard deserve to die for their horrific crime, but in the small town of Clayton, Mississippi, the heart of racism, the changes appear slim, at least they do to Carl Lee.  So, taking an M-16 in his own hands, he dispenses the justice that he knows will find these two men in no other way.  Now Carls fate lies in the hands of a brand new attorney, a disbarred lush, and a graduate student.  Will Carl Lee face his own brand of justice or can this bunch of misfits convince the jury that there isA Time To Kill?!
B00005KFUM|5.0|I really love this album, it makes you feel every emotion possible. It is so beautiful than I can not descripe it, you'll you have to hear it! My favourite song is &quot;citizen ereased&quot;, it almost makes me leave my body in a trance, it's truly wonderful. For my and Gods sake, don't hesitate, buy it, and fly away with the lovely tunes of Muse. It's not a dream, it's real!
B00005QZWJ|5.0|The movie should have won, too, but I digress...<br />The CD music goes so perfectly with the movie in terms of feel, emotion, action etc.  It is also an extraodinary piece of music in it's own right.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I hesitated to buy this dvd for quite sometime.  I wasnt sure whether she could have pulled something off half way decent with such a mediocre dance director WadeJo.  I almost felt ashamed to had put this concert down without seeing it in person or television after watching it in its entirety for the first time.  She is definitely one of our generation's most entertaining spectacles.  Although she lyp-synched through her best hits to date, she captured the screen with such presence not even her best lookin dancers could manage.  Highlights include, \\"ops..\\", \\"overprotected\\", \\"boys\\", \\"I love rock and roll\\", \\"lonely\\", \\"Slave\\", and no doubt \\"...baby one more time.\\"  Probably 3 of the highlights are worth watching over and over.  The energy of \\"i love rock and roll\\" is incredible.  The album cut is mediocre at best but the live version is just pure fun and class.  The funk fused \\"boys\\" should be heavily considered for single release after \\"overprotected.\\"  BUt the last, encore performance of \\"...baby one more time\\"..i dont have words to describe it.  It was erotic, teasing, artistic..etc.  If u thought her vma performance of \\"ops..i did it again\\" was incredibl, u'd no doubt love this.  this is far from perfect for example the cheesy production behind \\"anticipating\\" and her two best (but mediocre) ballads from her last two albums: \\"dont let me be the last to know\\" and \\"not a girl, not yet a woman.\\"  \\"Lonely\\" in addition didnt sound as sharp as the album cut.  But the sound quality of the dvd is top notch.  This only restored my confidence in her longevity after many doubts of her artisitic visual talent
B00005M91K|4.0|I expected this to be more in the genre of &quot;Koyaaniskatsi&quot;, but it wasn't quite that deep or symbolic.  The best part of this DVD is the imagary.  The filming is crisp, clean and the colors are vibrant.  Most of the scenes are very pleasing and/or interesting.  Some of the soundtrack weaves beautifully with the images but some of the music was so harsh or odd that I found it to be more of a distraction to the film than a complement.  Overall I think this was a tremendous amount of work for the filmakers and it's well worth watching.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Jeepers creepers where ya get those peepers..MAN THAT&quot;S IRRITATING!...the song in this movie. The movie is good,plot kinda murky..the demon wakes up every 29th day of every 29th spring?..um ok. Well Trish and Darry are right on the mark with that date, dirty laundry,dead cell phone and sticky clutch included. They're driving on this lonely road(lovely scenery)<BR>when they drive by this run down church and see this..guy..pulling out bloody sheets with bodies in them.<BR>This is where the fun starts.<BR>This creepy demon or whatever it is jumps in his decrepit looking<BR>truck and gives chase,,however it's souped up<BR>The movie is kind of unclear as it goes along, the town they land in is completely unbeknownst of any demon<BR>Well later the kids tell the cops and they finally confront the demon as it lands on top of the cop cars roof. One Gory Scene<BR>coming right up( A Twitch of humour too when the demons done with it's snack)<BR>All in all not a bad movie..the corniest scene though (my favorite) is when Trish is trying to run the demon down and he jumps up and does the&quot;running over the car&quot; routine.Well you'll see.<BR>Thumbs up
B000001FS3|5.0|This CD was the first I ever bought in 1988 (a year after the official release), and I still love it.  It also marked my first exposure to U2, after all the hype that surrounded it around the time I bought   <br />The &quot;1st side&quot; of the album is full of U2 classics (Where The Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, With Or Without You, Bullet The Blue Sky, etc.).  <br />The second side is strong as well (One Tree Hill, In God's Country, Exit).  <br />One of their best!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest I've ever seen! If you like senseless comedy or/and Ben Stiller movies, this is a must! It is one of my favorite comedies! Get it!
B00005YU1O|5.0|I am so relieved that the best movie of last year was an indie flick. I do my best to be a snobby arthouse lover, but most years the indie world lets me down, and I'm forced to concede that Hollywood made the best titles yet again. Not so in 2001. Waking Life was by a long shot the very best picture that came out last year. Its beauty, its subtlety, and its overwhelming brilliance placed it far above even the good big-budgets like LOTR. This was the film for the thinking man in 2001, and actually, come to think about it, for the last several years. My faith in independent movies has been revived.
B00005RY7X|5.0|with andrew w.k his cd is the best new music and he can be the saviour of rock and i hope he will because people will start liking him try to be like him like everyone does hes just bringing back the way rock should be
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is U2's masterpiece.  Carefully crafted with sound and lyrical imagry. This is U2 at their absolute best with all the elements in place.<br />Every song is a gem on this one.  It would probably be one of my &quot;desert island&quot; albums.
0201633612|5.0|Design Patterns book is one of the must haves for any software developer.  I consider it the bible for software development. It is a very hard to read book but once you understand the concepts and put them into practice, it is unmeasureable the time savings and ideas that it gives you. <br />I have implemented many of the patterns in applications I have written.<br />The Book is still very relevant today as the day it was written. I find myself constantly re-reading the book and everytime I discover new concepts and ideas of points that I missed first time round.  I have personally read this book cover to cover 30 times.<br />On conclusion, I beleive every software developer should own a copy.
0385501560|3.0|I liked this book enough to finish it, but two things become abundantly clear during the reading: 1) this guy has a problem with women, and 2) this guy has a particular problem with his mother.  Those are not, in themselves, bad, it's just that the point is driven home so often that it becomes tiresome.  That the mother in the story is referred to as &quot;the mommy&quot; served only to annoy me after about the second time.  Palahniuk is a funny, talented writer (I love his stories of the twelve step programs), but he relies too heavily on repetition to enlighten his readers.  Chuck, get some therapy, and get over yourself!
0060977493|5.0|I decided to read this book on a recommendation of a friend who raved about the author's writing style.  <BR>The book was amazing.  It took me about a week to get through it, and I couldn't wait for the ending.  You're given the ending in the beginning, but the way she suspends the events and gives you a taste here, a taste there of what really happened, just leaves you in absolute suspense.. and when you finally get to the conclusion of what happened you're completely wound up from wandering through the whole book and all those intertwining stories.  The prose is also amazing, you just want to eat the words off of the page, and her writing has the true mark of India.  By that I mean the colors just spring from the page, the way everything is described.. it's great.
B000001F3C|5.0|This is the &quot;classic&quot; U2 in all it's glory!  Sunday Bloody Sunday! New Year's Day!  Two Hearts Beat As One!<br />Great songs and more!  What really impressed me about this album was the way it was recorded. I love the sound on it, with the drums out in front enforcing the force of some of the songs (Great job Larry!).<br />It was with this album, I had gotten a better appreciation of the U2 as a &quot;band&quot;.<br />The best of the 'early' stuff.
B00004WIBW|5.0|i've seen dozens of movies that have badmouthed witchcraft, and i'm glad there's finally a movie that supports the wiccan belief (which i'm assuming katrina is. that or pagan. not sure. but still.) ^_^ i was really happy when i saw the entry in the book for the pentacle katrina had been drawing. other than that, great movie and it's inspired me to buy the book (though i hear it isn't like the movie). but this is an incredible movie and i'm actually watching it on tv now (while flipping back and forth between that and 'congo'.) i highly recccomend this movie!

B000001E18|5.0|Whereas Achtung Baby was U2's Pet Sounds, Zooropa is U2's Smile.<br />Experimental, wild, relaxing, smooth.  I really like this album.  Although there are other albums that are better this one is in my top 5 slot for favorite U2 albums.<br />Give it time.  Either you love it or hate it.
B00005QEO2|5.0|This CD is a great one to have in your Aerosmith Collection, It has the best of their music from the 80s and 90s. It's a must have
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is a good U2 &quot;starter&quot; CD.  It is a decent overview of their &quot;80's&quot; material including the trio tracks from The Joshua Tree, Pride (In The Name of Love), New Year's Day (albeit in edited form), Sunday Bloody Sunday and a slew of songs from Rattle and Hum.<br />Two complaints.<br />a) no Gloria and Two Hearts That Beat As One<br />b) too much material from Rattle and Hum (I would only settle with Desire and Angel of Harlem)<br />I really don't mind the &quot;edited&quot; versions of songs as long as it doesn't detract from my listening experience (others may disagree).<br />For beginners, get this CD along with Achtung Baby and hopefully you'll get some of the picture.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|ok, I give this movie 5 stars only because I know alot about him.  The guy is my all time hero.  But the thing is there will be some people, peobably most people who dont know a single solitary thing about Ali, so when and if they see this movie, their going to be confused so much about Ali.  The movie doesn't portray his life very well at all.  The movie would have been up to 3 hours long if they portrayed his life a little better.  But personally, I loved the movie, because it was about my hero.  It's my favorite movie, thats why I give it 5 stars.  But I give it 3 stars for the viewer who knows little about Muhammad Ali
B000001EAQ|4.0|Like others, when I first listened to POP I thought, what tha? But after a few more listens I got it and really dig it.<br />U2 further expands on their &quot;electronic/synthesizer&quot; phase with a less experimental album than Zooropa.  With a more &quot;techno/grunge/dance&quot; feel to a lot of the songs, U2 also incorporated sweet guitar riffs and thunderous rhythm to just about every song on here.<br />The weirdest tunes on the album are on the second half of this CD including &quot;Miami&quot;.  There are dark tunes like the haunting &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;, funky tunes &quot;Mofo&quot; and &quot;Discoteque&quot;, and loud rock and roll tunes &quot;The Last Night On Earth&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;<br />The whole album is worth a listen (more like a few listens actually) to get the gist of what U2 was doing.  <br />Best tracks IMO, &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot; and &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, but as stated before, the whole album rocks.<br />Yes, U2 purists (whatever that is), probably will not like the &quot;new&quot; sound, but give it a few listens and it will hopefully grow on you.<br />Not their best effort, but an interesting listen.
1573225517|5.0|'High fidelity' is one of those books that kept me reading untill 3 am, because I just couldn't stop.  For this, I can see lots of reasons:<BR>First of all, the book is written in an easy and fluent style. It needed zero concentration, let's say it practically read itself.<BR>Secondly, it bursts with wit.  From the first page on, Hornby swept me off my feet with his smart observations and his funny way of putting things.<BR>Thirdly, Rob (main character) is a perfect prototype of the 30 year old single person in modern society.  Some parts were so recognisable me and my friends had some good laughs reading them out loud to each other.<BR>In the last place, the book is written in the first form, which makes it -if such a thing is possible- even more accesable.<BR>In short: hurray hurray hurray for Hornby !
B000001FA4|4.0|The Unforgettable Fire is a fair album but not U2's best. Highlights for me are the first 4 songs and Bad.<br />The rest is just OK. For a beginner, I'd go for either the 1980-1990 CD, The Joshua Tree, or Achtung Baby.
B000051VWW|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend and I, really never having been a Sade fan before, found it quite nice to listen to this.  Older Sade was \\"ok\\", but somehow I have the impression that it was a bit syrupy for me.  I didnt find this to be the case with Lover's Rock. ...
B00004SCBF|5.0|This sounds great remastered!  The standout track here is &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot;, an ode to groupies.  Excellent lyrics, great leering horns.  Oh, and I love Boz's vocals.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I have always been more interested in Bob Dylan and his songs than in his actual execution of the music.  When I hear something new by him I truly want to like it, and am often disappointed.  Love and Theft is one of the happy exceptions, and marks a return to a rootsy blues style not heard in such full flower since the all-time Dylan classic Blonde on Blonde.  The soon-to-be 61-year-old Dylan can still crank it out with a vigor and conviction that is reminiscent of his manic mid-sixties albums and astounding, considering his near brush with death a few years ago.  <br />The only thing holding me back from a 5-star rating is Dylan's voice.  At once horrid and fascinating, he growls and rasps, yet manages to caress his lyrics with subtlety and occasional tenderness.  His voice has gone through several incarnations in his 40-year career, each one as contrived as the others.  One wonders - does he even HAVE a perfectly natural singing voice?  At any rate, some of these affectations simply sound better than others.  Give me the rich baritone of Nashville Skyline any day.  The new ugly Dylan voice fits this music in some fashion, but it's not something that is easy to enjoy.  I will promise you this, though: your repulsion to the voice will decrease with each listen, as the artistry of the songs and his astoundingly tight backup band reveal this to be one of the greatest Dylan albums of any style, and of all time.  His lyrics and his phrasing, as always, are vital to the overall impact of the songs.  Typically for him, there is no lyric sheet provided so you have to listen carefully.  They come at you fast and are difficult to hold in memory until you hear them again.  About half the songs are pure blues-rock, a form that lends itself to some of Dylan's more humorous twists.<br />The album seems to be organized in pairs.  Each odd-numbered track is roadhouse blues, and each even-numbered track something a little more contemplative and melodic.  They juxtapose nicely, andmy favorite tracks are about evenly divided between them.  The ones that sound best to me at this stage of my digestion of Love and Theft are \\"Mississippi\\" (#2), \\"High Water\\" (#7), \\"Honest With Me (#9), \\"Po Boy\\" (#10) and \\"Cry a While\\" (#11), but the quality is pretty consistent throughout.  And let me say it loud and clear: the backup back - backup is a misnomer - is superlatively strong.<br />If you are a Dylan fan, then you must own this collection and probably already do.  The big news here is that if, like me, you often don't like his music, listen to this anyway.  You will find yourself saying \\"Wow\\" a lot and smiling with pleasure and amusement.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|ben, you were pretty funny in 'mary', ok in 'meet the parents', but this one just doesnt do anything. sorry man, youre a comedian, not a director, or is it the other way around? cuz, ben you werent funny at all in this flick. this was just plain bad. the funniest part was.....wait a minute, i dont even think there was a funny part.....
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam was definitely the best rock band to come from the 90's.  I like bands like Nirvana and the Stone Temple Pilots, I mean they're O.K., but I don't think they're nearly as good as Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam stays true to their classic rock influence, and adds some grungy, darker songwriting, which I really like.  The album starts off a little slowly, and you might get impatient with the beginning of &quot;Once&quot;, but once the music kicks in, it starts to rock.  &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; were the big hits, and they are all great(especially &quot;Alive&quot; - great guitar solo!) but I disagree that they are the only good songs on the album.  &quot;Black&quot; is a slower and beautiful song.  &quot;Why Go?&quot; is another hard rocking, darker song, with another great guitar solo.  Mike McCready is an extremely talented guitarist, and he shines on this album.  You can really hear his classic rock influence.  Another thing that is great about this album is the lyrics.  Eddie Vedder can tell stories better than anyone, and if you've seen the video for &quot;Jeremy&quot; you'll know what I mean.  Well, I can't say much more about this album.  I think even if you are a fan of only classic rock, you will still enjoy it.  If you're a fan of hard rock in general, you'll love it!

B000002L7Y|2.0|A-HA was a one-hit wonder, at least in the USA, where only &quot;TAKE ON ME&quot; received an absurd amount of MTV and radio display, to the point of becoming unbearable to ever listen again!!<br />In Europe, mainly int he U.K, thing were a little different, A-Ha being able to resist for more than five studio albums. BUt that was never a band to be taken seriusly. Other than the very good vocals, the ultra-pop-synth music is lifeless, industrial and toally electronic. That's why they succumbed.

B000002A3T|4.0|I have many Floyd CDs, and like or not, this one makes it to the player most often. Of course the older ones are classics, but I know them a little too well and like old college friends I invite them over only occasionally. <br />This album feels newer and fresher and sounds like a band that has finally come out of mourning. I agree with an earlier reviewer's comment that any other band putting out this CD would have 5 stars instantly, but this is floyd.
B000063DIR|2.0|Whoa...what the hell is this!?  OK, let me start by saying I have been an avid Ozzy fan since No More Tears. Despite my disapproval, I was intrigued when I heard that he was rerecording some of his albums. <br />What I got was a piece of [junk].  This is not the masterpiece I have loved since I was a kid.  The mixing is waaay off throughout the entire album.  The new recordings just don't mesh with the original vocals and guitarwork, and we're left with this mess.  The bass is too boomy. Randy's guitar tone has been altered (drastically), to where all you can hear is treble, which actually crackles and blares half the time.  I'm not kidding.<br />They've managed to turn Ozzy's vocals up too loud also, to the point where it almost sounds more like karaoke.  It just doesn't mix.  Oh, and then there's the flagrant amount of reverb they've added to the lead guitar.  Add that and the fact that they turned up the rhythm guitars too loud, and you end up barely hearing Randy's solos.<br />The big picture is that when you turn up the volume, all you hear is a jumble of treble that blares your speakers, and some boomy bass. Yippee.<br />If it sounds like I'm being a little harsh, oh well.  I love the Ozzman as much as the next guy, but there is no excuse to deface a classic album, and then sell it as if it were the original.<br />Okay, enough ranting, you get the picture.<BR>I give it two stars instead of zero, because, it is Diary of a Madman. (I guess)
B000002NHN|5.0|My little bird died in my hands while the final song on this album was playing ('Dante's Prayer')- the song ended and he was finally still after suffering for several days.<br />This is a great CD with lovely music and the best vocals. I just wish I could play all of it without becoming a soggy mess...it has such heart that I cannot forget that one time.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Everyone has been saying the \\"Princess of Pop\\" is seriously overrated. Um, actually, it seems more like she's been underrated lately, by a lot of people. \\"BOMT was a good song, I liked her when that came out, but then she changed...\\" BOMT was bubblegum pop. Yes, it was a good song. But Brit couldn't carry on doing bubblegum pop forever. Her voice is maturing and beginning to carry more of her own style. The type of music she does is also expanding, but at the same time it suits her. Anyway, you decide.<br />I'm a Slave 4 U - Gave me a jolt when I first heard it, but it sounds better with each listen. Makes you wanna get up and move to the music. Brit really puts herself into this song, and there's a unique beat running thru the whole thing. 7.7/10<br />Overprotected - One of my fave songs on the CD, it preserves Britney's more \\"bubblegum\\" roots, going back to a more \\"Oops! I Did it Again\\" feel. It's a good song. 7.6/10<br />Lonely - Again, more of an \\"Oops!\\" feel, less of the new electrofunk feel Brit's been playing with. A nice beat and good vocals with a strong feel. 7.7/10<br />I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman - A slow-ish ballad, one of the main featured songs. Nice on the ear with some meaningful lyrics, more of an inspirational song than any other Brit's done before. But if you were looking for an all-out powerful ballad, you'll be disappointed, this isn't one. 7.6/10<br />Boys - my fave song on the album!! Again, a bit strange [ for Brit ] on the first listen, but it only gets better. A sexy song full of rhythm, life, and a come-hither thing. Great rhythm and a catchy feel, just wanna make you get up and dance, even if it's just shakin' to the beat. Great song, even if the style's something new for Brit. 8/10<br />Anticipating - Whoa, very poppy. Not bad, just not my kinda thing. 7/10<br />I Love Rock'n'Roll - Originally done by Joan Jett, Britney's done a 'remake' thing. Not as good as \\"Satisfaction\\", but still good. C'mon, don't ya love rock? 7.4/10<br />Cinderella - A similar type of song to 'Lonely', but I prefer this song. It's got a unique theme, ( Cinderella *^_^* ), with an old Brit feel. Also a sort of get-up-and-move song, but it's nice to listen to in your room as well. Good song. 7.8/10<br />Let Me Be - Again, back to the pop princess' roots, with a more strengthy feel. Gaining on the whole album's \\"indepence\\" thing. Worth listening. 7.5/10<br />Bombastic Love - Interesting title, a \\"fun\\" song. Pretty good, on the poppish side. Strong beat. 7.5/10<br />That's Where You Take Me - A light, \\"crystallish\\" song. I didn't like it too much, something of an \\"Anticipating\\" flair again. The lyrics weren't too meaningful, either. Felt like a filler song or something. Kinda sweet, tho. 7.2/10<br />What It's Like To Be Me - I personally like this song quite a lot. Mixed in a pretty fun way, with Justins' background vocals popping out here and there; a pretty catchy, moveable song, plus a strong beat. 7.7/10<br />Overall, a good third album *^_^*.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is great stuff. It's different than your typical jazz quartet/quintet though. In true Mingus style, this disc sounds just a bit different than anything I have heard before. The group is larger and at times seems to be a bit *free-form*, but that is a good thing. Mingus keep 1 and 1/2 feet planted squarely in jazz tradition and ventures out a bit into large group experimentation. Don't get me wrong-this is not free jazz by any means. These songs are classics and they've never sounded better than they do here. This larger group swings great and the horn section is just outstanding.  The gospel-ish 'shout-outs' punctuate tunes with a very present 'earthiness' while on other tunes the group shows amazing restraint and plays with beautiful simplicity. <br />Highly recommended.
0064409422|5.0|The book, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fiction/fantasy book, similar to one of Tolkien's books.  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is the second book of seven to the Chronicles of Narnia.  Although being the second book, I would recommend it to be the first book of the series to be read.  It it easier and more clear to follow than first book, and the rest as well. Intended on being a older child's to a young teenager's book, this book would be suitable to be read by even adults. Being a fun and exciting book, it also has a somewhat rich vocabulary for being a book intended for children 9-12. It could be easily compared to the books of Harry Potter.  So if you like to read fantasy books, this is a book that must be read.  I give it a five star rating.<br />The book deals with four main characters Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are to stay at a professor's house during the air-raids of Great Britain. Having a boring time, the youngest child Lucy, wanders into a wardrobe. However this was no ordinary wardrobe because it led her into a whole different world. When she returned from this realm, none of her siblings believed her. Later they all end up venturing into this new world. This leads them to an adventure they would never forget. <br />In this land of Narnia, it is winter. Snow is everywhere, and this being very queer. For at home it is summer. The kids soon find out that humans do not exist here. Only animals that are both mythological and real, and sorcerers and witches dwell here. The children are called sons of Adam and daughters of Eve by everyone there. The children find out it is a large deal that they are there, and realize they are part of a prophecy.<br />They encounter the wicked White Witch, that has a curse over the land of Narnia. This curse is what makes it winter all year round. They find that they are the key to saving the cursed land of Narnia from the White Witch. All children see her as being the evil person she is, except for Edmund who befriends her. She plans to stop the prophecy with having him by her side.<br />The rest of them set out to meet the great lion Aslan, who will save the land of Narnia from the wicked White Witch. First, seeming terrifying, but then comforting, Aslan tells the children that they are the ones that will stop the White Witch. The story goes on from there.<br />That is the main point of the book. It is filled with many more enchantments and adventure then I could have put down. The book is a must read book that people of all ages should pick up and read.
1559409010|5.0|the best thing about this movie is that after you've watched it 12 or 13 times...you can go to work and chime in with other python fanatics.  you can't help but memorize the dialogue and reciting your favorite lines is hilarious.  &quot;i wanna have a baby&quot;  &quot;i wanna be a woman&quot; &quot;don't you oppress me!&quot;  &quot;alms for an ex-leper?&quot; &quot;you're weird!&quot;  and on and on.  Every time you watch this movie you will laugh at things you never noticed in prior viewings.  i don't care if you are religious...Life of Brian may be just the cure.
B00005UQ9F|3.0|While it has some weaknesses, \\"Session 9\\" manages to deliver some devilishly creepy chills and thrills. The sprawling old Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts, with its grim Victorian facade and general state of disrepair, makes a great setting <br />One of my favorite character actors, the Scottish Peter Mullan, plays the owner of a small HAZMAT cleanup company. He lands a desperately needed contract to clean up the old hospital and offers his crew a bonus of $10,000 each if they can get the job done in a week's time. The job starts out okay, but soon we see that mental stability is in short supply among these guys. The place may or may not be haunted, but that's almost beside the point. The horror stories they have heard about it, plus its ominous feel, are enough to cause the men to slowly unravel. Soon, horror, either real or imagined, waits around every dark corner.<br />The movie does a nice job of building tension, although some people will find the pacing too slow for them. For quite awhile, nothing specific happens, but the mood tells us that something dreadful is going to happen. And it does.<br />The screenplay's main weakness is in its character development. The actors' characters are sketchily written, which makes it hard to get that involved with them. The ending may surprise some. I saw it coming, but this did not ruin it for me, since it seemed like the only logical conclusion.<br />One element that makes \\"Session 9\\" a bit different is that it isn't a Doomed Teenager movie. With one exception, it's a Doomed Adult movie. In any case, I think this is one of the better psychological horror thrillers of recent years.
B00005JKBC|1.0|Obtuse story telling by a director who is in love with short scenes, and tight close-ups of mostly meaningless detail.  It's hard work for the viewer to decode the dense plot.  I couldn't have cared less about any of the shallow characters in this &quot;oh-so-with-it movie.&quot;
B000060P79|4.0|I love this CD! I just started out liking &quot;I'm Just a Kid,&quot; but then I got around to listening to more of the songs on the CD and I TOTALLY love it! &quot;One Day&quot; is a great great great song! ROCK ON! **Lauren**
6300213714|5.0|The movie Warriors is simply the best movie there is. It depicts the &quot;Warriors&quot; from Coney Island, in which they have to bop their way back to the CI. Along the way they must confront the different gangs that are after them because they are wrongly accused of killing Cyrus.Of course they make it because they're the best and the rest is ours.It is truly a great but simple movie which is worth watching over and over. My only disappointment with the DVD version is that it leaves out the daytime gathering of the Warriors at the very beginning.
B00005JLBX|5.0|If you love Mozart's music, you will love this movie.  This is a beautiful and rich story of WA Mozart's life although some of the story is based on what many believe to be a fictitious rivalry. Regardless, just the music is enough to make this a tremendously enjoyable movie to watch.
0553296981|4.0|I am making this review to inform you about the book/play &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot;<br />  I think this play,the characters in the play and the thing they have to live with is amazing. If I were in the situation that they were in, I would have been caught the second day.<br />  Not only do these people have to live with each other until the war is over, they have to live with the problem they have with each other as well.<br />  For this play, I give it four and a half stars because I think it was too short.

0140441166|5.0|This is one of the most cynical works on love and sex ever written.  Actually, love and sex don't have anything to do with each other in this book.  I don't think that the characters in this book even believe that love exists.  So what does that mean?  That the characters are all lighthearted libertines who enjoy free love with abandon?  No, Valmont et al use sex like a weapon.  What they really get off on is their own aggrandizement through the degradation of other people.  It is shocking in its honesty and its unromantacized view of human sexuality.  Highly recommended!

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Okay, this is not an analysis of the \\"Tiny Dancer\\" bus scene; if you want to read about the music of the film, read my review of the soundtrack.  Moving on...<br />What can be said about Almost Famous that hasn't already been said?  First, this was the first truly great film of the new milennium (I hate Gladiator with a passion, but that's another story).  Second, Caneron Crowe LOVES rock music (hell, he's married to Nancy Wilson).  <br />Third, this is what magic feels like.  It's sun flares in the camera lens as Stillwater and etc. are leaving a truck stop.  It's Kate Hudson dancing in concert trash after the Cleveland show.  It's the Band Aids' scarves dancing in the eyes of Patrick Fugit.  It's Jason Lee's popularity speech.<br />What this special Untitled Bootleg DVD does is make Almost Famous a universe.  There are two versions of the film: the theatrical version (what you show to people who have not seen the movie) and the \\"Untitled\\" version, which clocks in at almost three hours. Among the special features are the script (no notes, however. ...), Cameron's fave albums of '73, with commentary, a behind the scenes music video with Nancy Wilson singing.  There is the complete Cleveland show, more songs, the infamous \\"Stairway\\" scene (supply your own Zeppelin), and three hidden features.  One of them is pure brilliance, Cameron's homage to Truffaut.  If it were included in the theatrical release, Kate Hudson would have won the Oscar. Also included is a wonderful full-length commentary on the Untitled version.  This is, by far, the best commentary I have ever heard. It is like watching the film with Cameron,his mom, and the Vinyl Films production company.  There are insights into his life, how the film was made.  In short, it's a lovely kiss blown to the kiss blown to rock n' roll.  One of the best additions in this package is the bonus third disk with all six of Stillwater's great songs (in acutality, Fever Dog is my least favorite!).  If you didn't know better,you would have thought that they were authentically vinatge.<br />But what about the movie itself? In my opinion, the best films make you want to do something.  Almost Famous makes some want to go out on the road and either sleep with or write about almost rock stars.  That is too specific.  This film, like Cameron's others (Say Anything, Singles, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky), makes you want to do something great and scary.  William Miller, at fifteen, goes out on the road with a rock band to write a story for Rolling Stone.  Penny Lane goes out on the road with Stillwater because she truly loves the guitarist, although she preaches against falling in love with rock stars.  She wants to encourage him to be great; she wants to help William become great. <br />While greatness is an ongoing theme in Crowe films, the heart of Almost Famous is (cheesy, but true) a string of love stories.  It is a love story between all of the characters and rock music (clarified by the Untitled cut.  Watch for Russell's cut \\"woo\\" speech at the San Diego show).  It is a love story between Russell and Penny, complicated by rock politics and the cool factor.  It is a confused love story between William and Penny, one not knowing how to feel about the other.  And it is a family love story; William's mother is embarassing, yet he is never embarassed nor apologetic about her. <br />This film is a prime example of brilliance in making the specific universal.  We are each a fan of something.  Cameron Crowe is a fan of rock music, but he used that fandom as a flavoring in this beautiful coming of age story.  By the end of the film, each character has grown up.  William is no longer a boy, Mom respects her son's ambition, Russell is more selfless, and Penny... well, she was the most adult person in the film anyway.  She brought the others to her level... she did her job.
B00005JKL8|1.0|I'd like to think I have a strong toleance for bad movies, but this one tested me the whole way.  We see Owen Wilson in peril then in the next scene he is inexplicably in the clear.  This pattern repeats itself throughout the film.<br />The story also ignores the general struggle to survive.  How did he eat or get water? ...
0736041850|5.0|I am a school teacher who teaches weight training and this book is outstanding for teaching students what muscles are involved in every lift.

B00000K29E|5.0|This CD exhibits the raw talents of a San Francisco based band-Big Brother and the Holding Company, including Janis Joplin of course. Though in studio, you can sense the many talents of the musicians being exhibited here. <BR>       Though much more \\"toned down\\" than in proceeding recordings, you can still sense that a blues powerhouse and an acid-rock motif is about to happen. Consider \\"Bye,Bye Baby\\" and \\"Down on Me.\\" Here, Janis sang in a very harsh voice and yet kept her bluesy-saloonstyle persona:notice the strong Texas accent.<BR>        A very common misconception is: Big Brother and the Holding Company was just a \\"backup band\\"for Janis. Well, any competant music fan would dissagree-strongly.Consider guitarist/bassist Peter Albin.Albin was one of the main songwtiters of many of the songs here:Light is Faster than Sound,\\",\\"Coo Coo\\",\\"Catipillar\\"and\\"Blindman.\\" In fact, Albin based Catipillar on an idea he came up with when he wrote children songs.\\"Coo Coo\\"(misreferenced as Jack of Diamonds)\\" is actually the song that would be re-versed as \\"Oh Sweet Mary\\" on the next album. You just have to admire Albin's intuition here.<br />        Guitarist Sam Andrew was responsible for the beautifully meticulus guitar leads played throughout this album. Note that he was actually singing a duet with Janis during the track:Call on Me(not the outake).<br />     Now guitarist James Gurley, on the other hand, is a totally different character here. Originally a folkie-fingerstyle picker, Gurley ushered his talents into the \\"acid rock\\" genre that BB&HC became famous for. Notice in \\"Blindman,\\" the twangystyle of electric fingerstyle guitar playing was no other than the works of James Gurley.Unfortunately, this CD does not have the classic instrumental \\"Hall Of the Mountain King\\".Nonetheless the guitarwork and moaning of \\"All is Loneliness\\"was begun by Gurley himself. <BR>       The drumer Dave Getz, who used the bass and snare trum almost simultaneously while playing the majority ofthe songs-contributed quite well.<BR>      <BR>      Notice:during the outakes and the endings of the songs performed on this CD, you could hear laughter and some dialogue.Most of the worldwide emerging musicians of the mid 1960s, (disregarding the Dead,the Airplane,etc,)tended to worry more about financial gains or musical survival(career ego).However, Big Brother just-played!Plain and simple;not only as one singer/backup band, but an ENSEMBLE.After listening to this CD, you will definitely know what I mean!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002BBY|3.0|The only people who make me laugh more than these musical weaklings who think they come even close to being the Beatles, are the lamers who think this is a work of genious.<br />I gotta hand it to them, this has a few seriously catchy tunes on it, although few and far-between. After all, i decided to listen to this in the first place because i like Wonderwall.<br />amazing:  Wonderwall, Champagne Supernove<BR>good:  Morning Glory, Don't Look Back in Anger<BR>ok:  Roll With It<BR>ridiculous:  the rest of this album<br />So yeah, Noel Galagher gets it right sometimes, but that can probably be attributed to luck more than anything. Because the rest of it is uninspired pop that anyone could have pulled out of their a$$.<br />Actually, maybe that's an unfair statement, because I haven't heard their other stuff, but if this is their best album, then no thanks.
0790729377|5.0|I cannot express how happy I was when I discovered this cinematic slice of tenessee flavoured pie. Streetcar is my bestest play and I was like a pig in muck when I found that Elia Kazan had directed it, then like a pig in a sewage works when I found that Brando and Leigh were portraying my most loved characters and then when I finally watched it and loved it the pig had died and left behind precious bacon for all.<BR>Never has so much inspired and inspiring acting been placed together, expert casting creates streetcars characters closer to the text than i ever could have hoped. Brando is pure masculinity, but manages to show that persicuted little bunny hiding below as only he knows how. Our Viv manages to make Blanche as mad as trimmed pig while still creating the utmost sympathy from the audience, the rest of the cast are also jolly fine and not pig like at all.<BR>The set is just magic, it looks just like a house occupied by our local witch, dingy, dirty and foul beyond belief but with that hint of something that makes you think someone has tried to make the best of a bad job, just how it should look. Kazan makes the New Orleans setting perfectly dank whilst retaining that exciting naughiness, the sounds that resonate continually throughout are expertly placed and really give great atmosphere and are like a symbiot to the poetic dialogue. And oh mother that dialogue, poetry thy name is Tennessee Williams, never have I left a film spouting so many of the lines, i assure you i was 'hey stella'ring for days after, and await the day i am given the oppertunity to express ' i have always depended on the kindness of strangers ', that day will come if i have to succumb to madness to achieve it.<BR>Do you get the feeling i like this film, my only problem is with the DVD thingy, its not a superb picture considering other Kazan and Brando classics have had good restorations, and the sound isnt put to effect ( I could think of several places where a good remix could have added tp the experience, blanches funny turns to name a few ) extras could fill a baby pigs stomach. But we have to remember this is from Warner bros and they arent renound for quality DVDs ( although they did a stonking job on rebel without a cause, so why not this)<BR>bye stella
B000059PPN|3.0|THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY is trademark Lucio Fulci. Filled with scenes of gratuitous violence, blood, murder, & of course, gore, this film ranks as a favorite for many gore hounds. <br />Unfortunately, the narrative of the movie is very thin. For the most part, the \\"plot\\" is incomprehensible. I give this film 3 stars very reluctantly due to the fact that the movie permeates a sense of creepiness, evil, & doom that suits a lot of great horror films. Fulci has a flair of style, undoubtedly. His horror films have a menacing aura (THE BEYOND & ZOMBIE are good examples). But other than that, his films lack the substance that makes great horror films, & that is a cohesive narrative.<br />Still, I enjoyed the mood & creepiness of the film. Interesting note is that former sexpot Dagmar Lassander is in this movie, albeit briefly, & gets quicly dispatched in a horribly sadistic fashion after her introduction. <br />THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETARY could have been better.
038533348X|4.0|If you're interested in learning about the stupidity of man and why religion is useful as an art form, this book is for you. Vonnegut entertains us with an apocalyptic tale about three kids with a dangerous new form of ice invented by their father who helped build the atomic bomb. Through their shortsightedness, the world is frozen and almost everything dies. Of course, no apocalyptic tale can exist without some commentary on religion and Vonnegut doesn't disappoint. He introduces us to a new religion built on top of \\"foma\\" a.k.a. lies. Which makes humans just actors in a play about the struggle of good and evil; how entertaining!

044022165X|5.0|In reading most of the reviews for this book I see that most of the other readers have a habit of comparing John Grisham books. I think that's a little unfair to each of the books individually. I've only read two other Grisham books and I will not do that here.<br />The Rainmaker is a very good book. I have only recently begun to read fiction and this book kept me involved. If you know me personally, you know that most books I start I don't finish. I usually read about 10 to 20 per cent of the book and then shelve it. (Why I do this, I don't know. Short attention span, maybe?) This one I finished. And within about three weeks. I'll admit it seemed a little slow in the beginning. Rudy, the main charactor had a lot of different stuff going on. I wasn't sure where it was all leading. The pace really picked up though. I read the last half of the book in about 4 days.<br />If you just want an entertaining book that deals with the law, I definitely recommend the Rainmaker.
B000005IU2|5.0|I'm a major classic rock fan and this CD was my first introduction to Iggy and The Stooges.  I'm open to all kinds of rock music (metal, glam, psychedelic, progressive, punk, etc.) and this CD just blew me away.  Iggy is like Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison (combined) on steroids!! (LOL)  This music was like a breath of fresh air-the type I'd crank up if I'm in a depressed mood!  It really \\"woke me up\\" (pardon my cliches-I just have no other words to describe this electrifying piece of work.)  It has that live in-your-garage sound and a lot of the chords are almost the same, but it's great rousing rock 'n roll nonetheless.  So, if you're looking for something a little bit different to pull you out of the dumps, this is it!  Trust me, you won't be disappointed!!
B000002KHF|5.0|I love this album but I rarely play it due to the number of times I hear the title track on the local classic rock radio stations.<br />This must be the most well known and thus general favourite of all of the Van Morrison albums. Coming early as it does in his solo career and with some great songs with catchy lines and recognisable lyrics this album encapsulates in a sense all of Van's career.<br />Along with Astral Weeks this album carves out it's own territory. It is hard to remember how different those vocals sounded to people back in 1970. Sung in what was essentially a revolutionary way with very different phrasing Van Morrison's singing style was a counterpoint to the soft San Francisco vocals and a step removed from the blues style vocals which characterised Britain's blues scene.<br />The quality of the songs is exceptionally high both lyrically and instrumentally. Van conveys his emotions very clearly and the result is an album which seems light and summery but which transmits themes of spirituality and romance with the celtic mysticism which was to become a more important part of the maestro's work in later years.<br />The sun was shining yesterday and it was a glorious day to revisit the album. Strangely enough when the album was over I turned on the radio only to hear the first bars of Moondance behind the DJs mindless chatter. I was glad when he shut up and I could hear it's magnetic refrain once again.<br />Enjoy.

If you haven't seen this one and already saw A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or THE FIRST U.S VISIT, you may be dissapointed after you'll see this one. However, I reccomend you to take this one. You may regret, but not for long.

He accidently gets rescued by the &quot;folksy-peasant type&quot;, Pacha, who is a good hearted family man and the unwitting participant in the whole episode.

My nine year old has the entire movie memorized.
B00000JR2A|5.0|This has been well reviewed by the others and without me digressing it deserves 5*.<br />The most beautiful and moving track on here is 'Woman In Chains' its a lyrical masterpiece and like so many talented artists (chris Isaac, Sarah Maclachlan etc...) is very underated. If you knew a precious diamond was within your grasp you'd grab it.... well as music goes here it is go get it , its a great album for driving, relaxing, and is inspirational, an 80s band years ahead of their time and one i doubt will be out of your c.d drive for a while.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I'm always on the lookout and hoping for a young representive for the classic standards. After hearing pretty Ms. Jones I have to admit I was very disappointed.  The voice is mature I'll warrant you.  It's old beyond it's years!! It appears to be wrecked!  She presents a song (esp. Nearness of You) with a breathiness that she must think passes for style.  Hopefully, she'll stick to the pop stuff and leave the standards alone.  She really doesn't know what she's singing about.
B000001FS3|1.0|yup...although most people attribute this being their best work, it is probably the most boring...the lyrics are as bad as Tori Amos and the sound quality is worse Dokken.<br />Steer clear from this rusty, over-hyped album.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|bazzy has crafted yet another ideal film for the MTV, ADD generation. just five minutes into this movie, i found myself reaching for the excedrin bottle and tossing 'em back like tic tacs. i wouldn't inflict such raucous sensory abuse on my worst enemy. this is montage editing at its absolute harrowing worst. it is really quite startling how little substance there is beneath the layers and layers of exasperating visual flourishes. am i supposed to be moved by the shallow, surface-level lust that the two lead characters are entwined in and moronically mistaking for love throughout the entirety of this drivel? am i supposed to be charmed by the nonsensical, excruciatingly irritating verbal diarrhea spewing forth from the mouths of the supporting characters, each of whom seem to have been transposed directly from a Mad Max film?<br />after stopping the DVD through the middle of this torture, i pulled it out of the tray and took a moment to examine the lovely colors of the disc. i glanced at it from various angles in admiration of the artistry and technical craftsmanship. and, suddenly, i came to an abrupt but utterly uplifting revelation: this DVD wanted to fly. and so i shoved aside the venetian blinds, swung open the window to the cool, smoggy Los Angeles air, and gleefully thrust my arm forward and watched baz luhrman's \\"masterpiece\\" cut through the brilliant evening skyline. and as i sat on the windowsill, my long hair fluttering in my eyes, my arms wrapped around my body for warmth, a wide smile stretched across my face...
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This CD is awesome. Thats all there is to it. It has everything. It has the cool rap sound, the headbanging guitar, and the lyrics(I cant understand these half the time, but they sound cool, and Zac actually seems to mean them). This is rock-rap at its best. They even beat Bizkit, because they don't feature rappers or swear every other word. The lyrics, when I can understand them, are actually saying something, and all the tracks are good. It doesnt have any dumb intros or weird interludes. My only complaint is that often the guitar solos get strange. But beyond that, this CD is what music should be. If you like rock-rap, intelligent lyrics(One member went to Harvard), and you're sick of bands like Bizkit getting weird, Rage wont let you down. BUY IT.
0064409422|5.0|As a child, I used to rent the cartoon movie version almost every week, having no idea it was a book. My second grade teacher read the book to the class, so happy that I was hearing the story, knowing everything that was going to happen and loving every minute of it. Now that I have graduated high school, this story not only entertains me but has sentamental value as well. It reminds me of my childhood. I collect different copies of the book and was so glad that they made a full color edition. The illustrations are wonderful. I must have read this story hundreds of times and it never gets boring. I reccomend this book to everybody.
B00005V9QJ|1.0|Sade has done some nice stuff, and I saw her play live 10 years ago, the band really cooked. This live album is a real let down. The recording is dire quality, and the crowd noise at the start of each song is impossibly irritating and loud. The playlist is very down beat, with only a few lively tracks. All in all, possibly the worst live CD I have ever heard. For someone who only releases new recordings infrequently this should have been a lot more special. 'Must try harder' Sade.
B000065U1N|3.0|This film is based on a real life event so that it is difficult to review. One can find that the events portrayed and the way that they are portrayed can become more important than the actual impact of the film as an entertainment.<br />The reality of the operation portrayed by the film was that the United States sent some peace keeping troops to Somalia, a country which had broken down to endemic civil war and had virtually ceased to function. The United States forces formed the view that this problem would be solved if some of the more major war lords were taken out of the equation. This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord in Somalia General Adid. The plan of the operation was to drop some highly trained troops by helicopter around a building. They were to arrest the war lord and then a convoy of vehicles was to remove him to the United States base. The operation went horribly wrong with two helicopters being shot down and the road convey getting lost. As a result a number of American soliders were killed and their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets by the Somalis. Other troops held out and were rescued by a force of Malaysians the next morning. The operation like any real life situation contained confused elements. On one hand there was the bravery of the soldiers on the ground, both the United States soldiers who went through hell and also that of the Somalis. Whilst the individual soldiers and pilots acted generally in a way that was beyond what could reasonably be expected of them the planning of the operation and the concept behind it was deeply flawed. <br />The film caters mainly to an American audience and for that reason it works to show the bravery of the American's involved. There can be no argument with this as they surely were. However the film tends to oversimplify the conflict by demonising the Somalis and by not looking at the sheer stupidity of what those soldiers had to go through. The reality is that thevarious deaths were for nothing as the United States forces were quickly pulled out. There are some minor reconstructions of history to downplay the role of the Malaysians and to suggest that the Americans had a greater role in the rescue than they in fact had. <br />If we leave aside these minor historical quibbles the film is surprisingly effective. It conveys a complex series of battles in a way that is clear and lets the viewer understand what is happening. The portrayal of the actual fighting is also reasonably accurate. (Apart from what is said above some scences featuring Eric Banna are also made up)<br />The film is also quite long, yet it passes quickly and one does not really have a sense of the time one is viewing it. One of Ridley Scott's better outings in a while.
B000003TA4|5.0|I believe \\"Nevermind\\" to be one of those rare records that transcends the era in which it was released. You can count on one hand the number of albums that fit into that category. \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Who's Next\\" are among the few rock albums that deserve to be called artistic statements.<br />\\"Nevermind\\" is an absolute fist in the face to everything that bankrupt American culture then represented. Pop music had absolutely nothing left to say to anybody by 1990. It had been stripped of everything meaningful by the vomit inducing, MTV inspired antics of Madonna, Prince and the entire \\"hair band\\" metal movement.<br />With one blow Cobain & Co. destroyed everything those vapid, money grubbing, posers stood for. Kurt Cobain as a person is not someone I would say I admire but his artistic vision is both vast and undeniable. His screaming \\"a denial\\" at the end of \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" is an absolutely sublime capturing of the rage, alienation and suffering of an entire generation.
0440219078|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is a novel which takes place in a community of the future. This community has strict rules. The people have no memories about their history and they don't see any colours. Only one man has the memories how life was in th epast. This man is the receiver of memories. His name is Jonas and he is 12 years old. He is trained by the Giver who was thr receiver before. They make a plan to change the community. They want to give the memories back to the people so that the get back their individuality. Will this plan work? Read the book and u will see it!<br />I think the book is great. It has a very good story. However, there are some logical mistakes in the plot and the end isn't the best I've ever read. But if you are not irritated by the mistakes and like future novels you have to buy and read this book<br />Have Fun!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I love tool.  They are my favorite band.  Was it worth the wait of 4½ years for Lateralus?  Why yes it was!  Although, Ænima was better, Lateralus comes at a close 2nd.  From the great beginning with 'The Grudge' to the end with 'Triad' (I'm not counting the last track, it's pretty annoying) Lateralus keeps your ears and mind entertained.<br />Lateralus sees tool leaning towards more of a progressional rock sound.  It isn't as experimental as Ænima, but that's okay, it's more refined.  It has more structure to it than any other tool album.  The lyrics are fantastic as well.  Maynard never seems to disappoint.  He has a lot of vocal range on this album, like usual, he even tries some different methods like on the songs &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot;.  Adam Jones's guitar work is absolutely superb.  He even has a few solos in this album, which you didn't hear too much of in Ænima.  Justin and Danny never seem to disappoint in the rhythm section.  The drums are amazing.<br />It's hard to not compare this album to their previous efforts, especially Ænima but it happens.  By itself, Lateralus stands and stands high.  In my opinion, it was the best record of 2001.  My favorite songs include &quot;Schism&quot; &quot;Reflection&quot; &amp; and &quot;Lateralus&quot;.  If you don't already have it, or haven't heard it I suggest that you pick it up as soon as possible.  It will not disappoint.
0385484518|5.0|A book to be cherished, a book that is making me a better person. I am conciously delaying it to enjoy it for as long as possible..! Morrie is a true mentor and this is the kind of book I would have like to have written myself, it speaks a human language, it is my feeling and approach to life written down in words that make sense.  It's written like it is to be loved, like life is to be lived, to its full intensity. I plan to give this book to everyone I know and respect.
B000002GZ1|5.0|From November 1964 until September 1966, I had the good luck to work at Big John's, the legendary Chicago blues club in the city's Old Town area a couple of miles north of the Loop. The Paul Butterield Blues Band really took off during its many engagements at Big John's. <br />This is the band's first album. The cover art shows Mike Bloomfield (left), Paul Butterfield, Sammy Lay, Elvin Bishop, and Jerome Arnold. The photo was taken on Chicago's Maxwell Street.<br />This is the band that opened the doors at Big John's to all of the great black blues bands on the South and West Sides: Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and others. This is the band that inspired other young white blues musicians who appeared at Big John's: Corky Siegel and Jim Schwall, Barry Goldberg and Steve Miller. This is the band that turned heads at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival when it backed Bob Dylan. This is the band that paved the way for the blues revolution in the 1960s and beyond. <br />Some of the songs on this album are blues classics, while others were written by South Side native Nick \\"The Greek\\" Gravenites and have since become blues classics. Nick is a blues legend himself and was a close friend of Butterfield and Bloomfield.<br />All of us at Big John's were excited by this album when Elektra released it. We felt we were riding the crest of a wave. Hearing this album always evokes warm memories of a wonderful time in my life, when I couldn't wait to go to work each night to hear more of this great music. And I was able to so for almost two years, until Big John's was closed by the powers that be in Chicago. The club was gone forever. But not the music.<br />You may read more of my memories of those great days on my jazz and big band web site...
B00005O3VC|5.0|For a British modern comedy troupe from the 1970s, thier films stand the test of time quite well:<br />A spoof on the Kinghts of the Round Table and Camelot (and every other King Arthur story), THG begins to tickle you right off with the whole 'coconuts instead of horses' issue. This running gag is only a small bit of the film, but you remember it. The same goes for every off-center bit, from the powerful wizard named Tim to the logic by which one determines if a witch is made of wood. Thinking man's humour, this is.<br />But before I scare off you simpler types, let me add that I've watched this with my 12 year-old nephew and he thought it was hilarious. That's another thing; this film does not warrant an 'R' rating. Doesn't now and certainly didn't back then, which makes me wonder what sort of gits were sitting on the panel of the MPAA at the time (as opposed to the silly twits sitting on it now).<br />Ah, bugger them all with the Holy Handgrenade of Antioch...
B00003CXDV|5.0|Even if you're not a Star Trek fan, you'll love this hilarious film starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman as washed up actors from the long-cancelled sci fi TV show \\"Galaxy Quest\\".<br />The premise provides for some really amusing gags as the film pokes fun at sci fi clich&eacute;'s and trekkie obsession. And Tim Allen, whose character is reminiscent of Buzz Lightyear, is great with a good script to work with after being in countless rubbish movies (Does anyone remember The Santa Clause?). And Sigourney Weaver is suitably feisty as the ...female on board.<br />But the really great standout performance is Enrico Colantoni, as one of the clueless aliens who thinks the team's TV show is real documentary footage of the group's adventures in space. The all of them get zapped up into outer space and uproarious mayhem ensues.<br />It's just such fun, and with a great ensemble cast, Galaxy Quest is an outstanding comedy that stands to repeat viewings in order to uncover all the subtle gags and jokes. Effects maestro Stan Winston's alien creations are fantastic and David Newman's score adds a heroic feel to the film. The DVD is great too, with excellent sound, picture and good extras. Top-notch entertainment.
B000001ELB|5.0|If you're a die hard KISS fan, you'll love this CD. It has studio versions of their hottest music to 1978, plus a 1978 version of \\"Strutter\\", which really doesn't sound that different from the other versions til the end of the song. Lots of good METAL on this CD except of course for the tear jerking \\"Beth\\" and the rough, but, slow, \\"Hard Luck Woman\\". ... I suppose one of the pluses of this album is the fact that you get to hear all the guys sing. Ace Gene Paul and Peter. Now, if you really want to hear these guys \\"Get Off\\", Please let me suggest, Alive I , Alive II, Alive III, and Alive IV. The cover is really cool and is a work of art in itself. ...
B00005U8EM|5.0|Harold Ramis's excellent film remains one of the best comedies of the 90s. Bill Murray is at his best as Phil Conners, a man stuck in Groundhog Day, taking his comedic routines to new heights and making the film rib-ticklingly funny. Both Murray and Ramis haven't found something as good as this since, especially Murray, whos'e wide comedic abilities are wasted in films like Charlie's Angels. But this one allows Murray to go crazy. Great film.
B000001FDK|5.0|Seen the movie, loved it, own the LP, love it too. Are you a Frankie Valli fan? Or one of John Travolta or Olivia Newton-John? Then you'll love this CD packed with fun pop/rock songs as well as some romantic music. Just to give you an idea of how popular this music is, the song (sang by John Travolta and Olivia Newton John) &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot; went number ONE and several other tunes, namely &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; sang By Olivia, &quot;Summer Nights&quot; sang by Olivia and John, &quot;Greased Lightnin&quot; sang by John, &quot;Grease&quot; sang by Frankie Valli, all did great on the charts. You also get performances by Sha Na Na and Stockard Channing, plus songs by other cool artists. There are 3 songs performed by Olivia and John together, two by John himself, and two by Olivia by herself. You get funky music, romantic tunes, and pop rock. This is great music to sing along too. Great for 70's parties, and music without cursing like you hear in much of the stuff today. You know it's really interesting, of all the music and movies ever put out, the ones that made the most money were ones without alot of profanity. This is a CD the whole family can listen to and enjoy. The music has a 50's slant to it, though it was released in the 70's. My Shibani also loves this CD as well as the movie.
B000002O4S|5.0|Back to the Future is one of my all-time favourite movie soundtracks, with an excellent blend of Alan Silverstri's memorable score and Huey Lewis and the News's equally outstanding songs. Highlights include &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;Back in Time&quot;, &quot;Earth Angel&quot; and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. This is exceptional music in a great album. A must have for any film soundtrack enthusiast.
B000001ELD|3.0|OK, first of all, I'm a KISS fan so you know that when I give this one only 3 stars something's not up to par. Don't get me wrong, Gene sings the songs he does on this work very  professionally, only this is not a total CD of hard driving Rock n Roll. In fact, there is one song on here that you can hear at Disneyland &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot;. But I have to admit, Gene sings it as good as anyone I've ever heard. You're going to get about 3 other songs that have a slow to moderate beat, and the rest are Rock. The one thing this CD does do is show Gene's enormous musical talents. As any KISS fan already knows, Gene can sing in the deepest bass voice, but, on &quot;Always Near You/Nowhere To Hide&quot;, Gene hits high notes like an opera singer, and he does it very well. If you're wanting to hear a CD with nothing but metal, you've come to the wrong place, because this CD is not it. If you want to hear some good rock and some great slow to moderate rock with a touch of a lullaby, you'll love it.
6304143184|5.0|I saw this film when I was 11 and I just saw the re-release.  Looking through a 21st century lens, it's more magical now than it was twenty years ago.  It has what current films lack:  innocence, originality, selfless endearing characters, and a story that captures the heart.  This film actually tells a story.  Despite the groundbreaking special effects employed in this film, it was no vehicle for the special effects crew to show off--F/X was used to further the story rather than the story being used to further the F/X, which doesn't exist in modern-day films.  Steven Spielberg aims for the gut and succeeds.  It's his most personal film to date and the best work of an artist comes from within.  <br />There are too many memorable scenes to list.  Among them are the first encounter between Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and ET, ET chasing after her with his arms raised as she is forced into the closet by her brother Michael (Robert McNaughton), ET following a trail of Reeses Pieces left by Elliott, ET dressed as a woman by Gertie, and of course, Elliott and ET flying on a bicycle silhouetted against a full moon.  The re-release contains 4 additional minutes of footage left out in the 1982 release.  The scene of Elliott and ET taking a bath is humorous but that of the mother, Mary (Dee Wallace), looking for her children on Halloween night is superfluous.  Somewhat objectionable is the PCness of the new version.  The Feds' guns are replaced with walkie-talkies and Michael's Halloween costume is referred to as that of a \\"hippie\\" rather than \\"terrorist\\".  Such changes are subtle and won't be apparent to the viewer unless one was looking for them.  The DVD will include both versions so purists shouldn't fret.  <br />The performances are impressive.  The main characters--the three children, their mother and ET--are developed throughout the film.  The children don't pander to the audience with the affected cutesy routine coached to present-day child actors.  A pre-substance abuse Drew Barrymore is adorable as Gertie and Henry Thomas is a natural as the lonely and melancholy Elliott.  Robert McNaughton, now out of the acting business, is undeservedly ignored by the entertainment industry--they should give him a worthy role for a comeback.  The best performance, however, comes from the alien creature.  He is smart, mischievous, sensitive and sweet.  One forgets he's a wrinkly rubber puppet and perceives him as the cutest/cuddliest creature in film history.  <br />As indelible as ET is in our hearts and minds, it did not win the major academy awards.  Spielberg mistakenly overmarketed this film through selling all sorts of ET products, i.e. cereal, toys, clothes, stickers, which created a backlash.  ET was thus aced by Gandhi for the Best Picture and Director Oscars.  In hindsight, Gandhi is a by-the-book biopic and ET is an endearing original film every generation will see and love.  The phrase \\"ET phone home\\" will be in the lexicon of the English language for quite some time.  As ET says in his farewell to Elliott, \\"I'll be right here\\".<br />PS:  Watch this film with a box of tissues.  Grown people in the theatre who saw this film as children still cried their eyes out (myself included).  I sometimes wish Elliott left with ET for a happy (happier?) ending.
B00005OAIE|5.0|... John Mayer has the smoothest, sexiest voice. His lyrics are extremely meaningful, and the melodies are absolutely contagious! This is FEEL GOOD music at it's best. The smile playing on my lips when listening to John is proof enough. I wish that I had discovered this wonderful talent sooner! Now I need to see him LIVE! That has to be an awesome experience. I'm 25 by the way, and married. No teenie bopper here...LOL! Room For Squares is a great album, but you must experience ALL of John Mayer. Check out all the web sites devoted to him and download some of his other songs. There are some real treasures to be discovered. Especially take a listen to Comfortable and Man On The Side. These are some wonderful gems! I can't wait to hear what else John has to offer. ;)
B000002J0B|4.0|I love this album, it took me a while to get into it, but I love it.<BR>\\"The rain song\\" is one of my all time favorite Led Zep tracks. Other standout tracks include \\"Over the hills and far away\\", \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" and, of course \\"No Quarter\\".<BR>The only song on this album I don't like is \\"The crunge\\", for some reason everybody loves this song, but I find the lyrics to be tart, and the vocal effect on Robert Plant's voice doesn't seem to fit in with music.<BR>All in all this is a excellent album, and I would suggest it to anyone who's into classic rock, or a Led Zeppelin fan.
1878424319|2.0|I must start off by saying that I am not a self-help person. I read it and remained unconvinced. The stuff in this book is the same that floats across the air every day. Framed in &quot;ancient&quot; teachings, it might appear wise, but wisdom does not have to be a function of age or another (foreign, exotic) culture.  I'm not trying to be mean, but  this felt equally artificial as Anthony Robbins' plastic face.
B000002UB6|3.0|I feel that even with all the good songs on this album, that it's still a little weak and uneven. <BR>The orignial idea of the 'Get back' project, (which later turned into 'Let it be') was to write, reherse and perform new material in front of a live audience. That idea fell through when George Harrison temporairly quit. When he did return, he brought Billy Preston with him to 'ease' tensions in the band.<BR>Since there was no real performance, the Beatles wound using the tapes of them basically jamming together to make the album.<BR>This gives the record a loose fell to it, since they didn't want to do any studio 'sweetening' to the songs. Now the oxymoron is that after they finished the sessions, John Lennon gave the tapes to one Phil Spector, who is known to sweeten anything he touches with orchistras, horns, strings and such. <BR>So on one hand you have the Beatles, (sometimes with Billy Preston) performing live and raw, as nature intended, and on the other hand, you have Spector's strings and such that give the record a 'produced' feel to it, leaving it sounding very lop-sided.<BR>There are good songs though, &quot;Two of us&quot; has song great Lennon/McCartney harmonies in it, and both &quot;Dig a pony&quot; and &quot;I me mine&quot; have great hooks to them.<BR>Of course the title track steals the show, &quot;Let it be&quot; is a remarkable song, and is very heart warming.
630460288X|2.0|...  To Sly's credit this movie wasn't that bad but the only thing it's got going for it is Snipes one liner's, fighting and Bullock's good looks.  Not much to work with folks!
0375500901|5.0|This gripping novel revolves around Gabriel Allon, presently one of the world's most accomplished art restorers.  Allon had previously used art restoration as a cover for his exploits as the top notch secret agent for the Office, a Mossad-like organization of Israeli intelligence.  He has retired from this service a consequence of the killing of his son and the maiming of his wife in a car bombing.<br />Ari Shamron, head of Israeli intelligence, coaxes Allon out of retirement with an assignment to kill super Palestinian terrorist Tariq al-Hourani, the man responsible for destruction of his family.  Tariq has planned to disrupt the ongoing peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.  Along the way Tariq kills the Israeli ambassador to France and other prominent Israeli citizens living in Europe.  Allon using other agents, including gorgeous French model Jacqueline Delacroix, who has fallen in love with Allon on a previous assignment, plans a trap for Tariq.  Little does Allon know but the cunning Tariq is dying from a brain tumor and wants to go out in a blaze of glory.<br />Silva does a terrific job in moving the story along and psychologically profiling both the reluctant hero Allon and the devious villain Tariq.  I'm anxiously looking forward to my next Silva book
B00005K3O4|4.0|After the first viewing you will say wow! that film was interesting but could have been so much more.  This really doesn't matter.  After the second viewing you will understand what the filmmakers were going for and how they succeded on every level.  It could be remade, but it would probably lose much of its low budget charm and freshness.  The cast is only marginally good but it's not a variable.  The film plays like a nightmare and is a perfect addition to MGM's Midnite Movie collection because it is best viewed in the later kult hours.  You might just walk away unsure about clowns and their motives.  What a fresh concept.  Thank you Chiodo Brothers!
B00005ASOC|3.0|The first thing that came to mind as this story unraveled was that it's a cross between Good Will Hunting and Dead Poet's Society--brilliant, undiscovered mind, fancy prep. school, gentle nurturing teacher. The obvious difference, of course, is that the wunderkind in this film is black. <br />Perhaps that would have been enough of a twist to save this film but, alas, all the familiar stereotypes were used--black kid is a menace who will steal a BMW; black kid will excel only on the basketball court; black kid who achieves great things in a classroom must be cheating or plagiorizing. This angle of the story was unfortunately predictable and dull. <br />I wanted to like the movie but it had too much of the same flavor as GWH (I was surprised to learn both were directed by van Sant because one would think he'd stay away from twin films like this) and seemed wholly unoriginal. Rob Brown, first-time actor, put forth a brilliant performance. Connery, however, was his same Scottish self.

0345448898|5.0|Following in the literary tradition of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, Philip Pullman creates an alternate reality in the His Dark Materials trilogy composed of The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. Pullman reveals this world through the eyes of Lyra, a young child with a very serious role to play in the battle between good and evil that threatens to destroy her world and others. In Lyra's  world Calvin became Pope, other universes exist on the other side of the Northern Lights, and the search for the cause of original sin leads her on a life and world-changing journey. Pullman's crisp, evocative writing style, precise attention to detail, and regard for the great philosophical mysteries of our world combine to give this \\"children's\\" trilogy universal appeal. <br />     In The Golden Compass, Lyra's life changes forever when she eavesdrops on a conversation between Oxford scholars and her uncle, Lord Asriel. She embarks on a series of adventures that not only reveals the true identity of her parents, but take her to lands she never dreamed existed. The second book, The Subtle Knife, introduces us to Will who will become Lyra's friend and companion for the rest of the series. Will's search for his long-missing father leads both children closer to understanding their part in the battle between Good and Evil. The third book in the series, the Amber Spyglass, not only lived on the UK bestseller's list for months, but nabbed the coveted Whitbread Book of the Year in 2001, the only children's book ever to receive such accolade. The action carefully set up in the first two books plays out in this, the finest book of the three.<br />     If you're tired of waiting for Book Five of Harry Potter, want to consider the intricacies of Original Sin and the human condition, or are just looking for a beautifully-written and action-packed saga, read Pullman's His Dark Materials. You won't be disappointed.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Those who watched &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; are divided into two camps: Love it or hate it.  This reviewer considers it a complete waste of time, an overwrought and silly exercise, operatic without the redeeming quality of opera music,  lurid and phantasmagoric without the redeeming lightness of camp.  In a word, perfectly horrid. The hackneyed story is filled with cliched dialogue; freshness is completely lacking.  The concept for this movie took a wrong turn somewhere early on in development, like an early prototype for an airplane that ended in disaster for all concerned.
B000065U1N|5.0|I'm an 18-year-old, red-blooded American female, so it should come as no surprise that I went to see Black Hawk Down mainly because Josh Hartnett is in it (and, okay, he was gorgeous, and gave a brilliant performance) I'd read the book, and wasn't sure if the movie would do it justice, but I wasn't disappointed. As anyone who's read the book knows, plenty was changed, but the main story, the theme, and the message remained the same. The collective performances by the entire ensemble, the direction, everything about it was striking. <br />Plenty of people complained about the lack of background, and how difficult it was to tell many of the charatcers apart, but to me, that just made the movie that much more realistic. I know people in the armed forces, and I've been told that THAT IS HOW IT IS. You go in, you follow orders, and sometimes you can't even tell who's on your side, let alone who an individual soldier is. As for character development? The whole point is that the soldiers, as a whole, ARE basically like on charcter. Lack of plot development? The battle IS the plot.<br />Ridley Scott didn't spare the audience any of the horrific details, and didn't sugarcoat the truth, and deserves to be applauded for having the guts to lay the facts bare for the audience to draw their own conclusions. Should be required viewing for anyone even considering enlisting in the armed forces.

B000063DIR|1.0|What a colossal disappointment.  The mixing is hideous, key instruments and passages are totally buried, it's waaay too compressed, on and on.  I could have done better with a 4-track.  DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|the best metal album of 2001<BR>get it NOW<br />P.S. poeple who listen to tool AND staind make me sick
B000002KB8|5.0|No? Well, don't come crying to me when you find it's too late to reclaim your soul. Some benign and rocking deity must have been watching over them when they produced this in three days for 600. This is a masterpiece, an absolute gem of an album and if you can afford only one Black Sabbath album make sure it's this one - of course then you won't rest until you've got the others but I did warn you.<BR>For sheer raw energy and the brutal promise of more to come none of the others can top it. Unexpectedly it has a polish and assured confidence you might expect from much more experienced and seasoned recording artists. Yes, there is a certain rough naivety too but all in all this is an astonishing achievement for a debut album. The intro to the opening `Black Sabbath' delivers all the melancholy, dreariness of a wet English October day like the aural equivalent of a picture. Ozzy - who was surely born to sing saetas on a Sevillian  street corner during Holy Week - has an authentic sob in his voice, the man sounds as if he is genuinely suffering. The harmonica at the beginning of `The Wizard' says it all, where it all came from and then the hard riffing cuts in to tell you where it's all going despite the irony laden up and hippy-happy lyrics. Now you're in and there's no escape. It's unremitting you've let them into your consciousness. There is no hiding place `Behind The Wall Of Sleep' will find you out that deep ominous bass, the menacing riffs will bring you down. N.I.B., an authentic piece of rock perfection, needs no praise from me if you haven't already pledged your soul to Black Sabbath at this stage, by the end of this track you will have as it drags you deeper in, the progression is remorseless. Deceptively short and simple you don't realise what the mesmerising `Sleeping Village' has done to you until you find yourself mindlessly rerunning it in your head hours afterwards. My own favourite track `The Warning' and `Wicked World' are the ones for guitar solo freaks. It feels like you've crashed a private jamming session and you hold your breath, trying to remain inconspicuous in case someone notices you're there uninvited and asks you to leave.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was when I was in Junior High School.  I loved the movie then and I love the movie now.  It was a beautiful and sad movie.  Everyone should see this movie.
0425180638|5.0|This book is for anyone who has followed the Kay Scarpetta saga from the start.  Its highly introspective and dark approach may be too boring or tedious for the casual reader.  But for the diehard fans, it is a fascinating read that ties up a lot of loose ends and gives greater insight into Scarpetta's mind.<br />I can't wait to see where the Doc goes from here.  New York?  I loved the Jaime Berger character.  I hope she shows up again.<br />P.S.  Definitely read &quot;Point of Origin&quot; and &quot;Black Notice&quot; first since this story is really the finale of these two stories.
B00005JKCF|5.0|My friend brought the DVD in New York in Manhattan for 20 dollars. First, of all my expectations for this movie was very high like it was for XMEN. X-Men disappointed me and just about all the REAL comic book fans. The CGI effects are amazing particularly when Spiderman swings from building to building. The people who play Peter and Mary Jane do a great job, but the Green Goblin actor takes the cake. The story is accurate to the comic which pleased me greatly.  I just hope that Venom and Carnage are in the sequel. Go support this movie!!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I won't bother to summarize the story of Snow White.  It is the classic fairy tale with a beautiful maiden, gallant prince, and evil queen.<br />This 2-disc set contains a depth of additional information that I found fascinating.  First, the restoration of the movie is incredible.  Disc 2 has a feature called the \\"Restoration,\\" and it details how new technology enabled Disney to clean up and refresh Snow White from the original film.  The piece contains a side-by-side comparison of the cleaned up version versus the original.  Absolutely stunning!<br />Other interesting supplemental materials from the 2nd Disc include \\"Abandoned Concepts,\\" \\"Disney Through the Decades,\\" \\"Storyboard to Film Comparisons,\\" and other well-done pieces of information.<br />This DVD truly is the total package.  The movie itself is timeless, and the supplemental material teaches you everything you've ever wanted to know about Disney animation and the creation of, and restoration of Snow White.  What truly struck me as something that sets it apart from other good \\"special editions\\" is the DVD's documentation.  The DVD's guide details each feature on both discs.  This saves time trying to navigate via the DVD.  Just find out what you want to watch, and cut to it via your DVD player.  Terrific!<br />This \\"total package\\" is a wonderful way to begin a Disney DVD collection.
B000003TA4|5.0|I dont care if you grew up in the 90s or grew up in the 50s there is no way you can hate this album. from the moment you put it in the cd player it is like you are on a drug. you will always listen to it, the more you listen the more you will love it.i buy new albums alot but none of them even come close to this album. Every song is great. no matter how old or young you are you will love this album, My mom even loves it now and she grew up liking the temptations. thats how great this band is. i think this is probably the best music anyone has ever sung throught history... and it will still be the best in years to come...THE GOOD DIE YOUNG...
B00005V9HH|5.0|I am glad that I waited for the \\"Special Edition.\\"  In all honesty, I'm not really into the \\"extras\\" that some DVDs contain.  I've purchased or rented several DVDs in the past year, and I can count on one hand the number of times I actually bothered to check out the extra material.  Only Disney's \\"Snow White\\" had anything that was truly interesting.<br />THIS \\"Special Edition\\" had extras that were unique (the profanity-laced Gag Reel), and truly interesting (the featurettes that included interviews with actors, producers, screenwriters, etc.)  My wife and I especially enjoyed the interviews, because they explained how the actors came together to create the chemistry that was needed to drive the plot and keep viewers guessing until the very end.<br />To summarize, 5 con artists are thrown together in a police line-up, and after getting out, they decide to teach the NYPD a lesson for giving them a hard time.  Their act of revenge (more like a thumbing of the nose, or a flipping of the bird) eventually leads them to more criminal acts.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the mysterious Keyser Soze is pulling the strings and making the quintet dance to his own tune.  Just who is Keyser Soze?  That's the question that keeps viewers glued to the screen, as the plot goes through several twists while leading up to an awesome surprise ending!<br />Of course, I am truly biased, because this is my FAVORITE movie of all time.  I would have a difficult time understanding how anyone could not appreciate the good acting, fine screenplay, and surprise ending.  Kevin Spacey became a household name with his portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint, and Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri were perfect for their roles (a con man trying to go straight and a customs agent, respectively).  Benicio Del Toro's small part as \\"Fenster\\" was hilarious - a portrayal he dubs as his \\"Mumbles\\" (as in the bad guy played by Dustin Hoffman in the \\"Dick Tracy\\" movie).<br />If you buy ONE DVD for great acting and a cool story (as opposed to \\"Whoa!  That sounds great on my home theater!\\"), this should be that DVD.and a cool story (as opposed to \\"Whoa!  That sounds great on my home theater!\\"), this should be that DVD.
B00005TT77|1.0|The problem with doing Beatles covers is that you can't really improve on the origional versions. The best idea is to try and do something different. Unfortunately none of the artist on this album have really done that, most of them chosing to do carbon copies of the origionals. Only Chocolate Genius, Howie Day and Grandaddy have tried to interperate their songs in a different way and, unfortunately, none of them were very successful.<BR>What is the point in covering a song if you're just going to copy the origional version? Maybe that's what the film-makers wanted but it makes for a really dull album.<BR>And by the way, how can songs written in the 1960's have been 'inspired' by a film made in the 21st century?
630450053X|5.0|Its the best movie I ever saw. Brandon Lee is exelent.Its a movie of justice and action. It was Brandon Lee's best and last film. Its a must see.
B000002NG7|5.0|Possibly their best effort - but with Faith No More it's hard to tell. After great deeds such as 'King For A Day' and the classic 'Angel Dust', this is their most complex and last record. A mix of alternative-hard-metal, it's weird - yet very listenable. \\"Collision\\" opens with heavy guitars and a familiar Patton-esque chorus. \\"Stripsearch\\" is a highlight, and it's quite easy to see why; it's alt-pop at it's best - not to be confused with Gorillaz [junk]. The third song, \\"Last Cup Of Sorrow\\", is probably the best - the words are so strong and the music is beautiful, despite being bold as FNM can get.<br />Every song is unique in its own way. \\"Mouth To Mouth\\" and \\"Naked In Front Of The Computer\\" sound freshier than \\"new metal bands\\" (there's no way to compare, though) sound today, and even \\"She Loves Me Not\\" is a good demonstration of their musical diversity - the last one sounding like Patton covering Elvis Costello.<br />If you're not a fan, you might as well want to listen to this album to take a peep at the most underrated band of the 90's at their peak; if you're a fan, you should get this album, enjoy the fine music and wish they get back together someday.
B000060P79|4.0|I'm always on the hunt for new punk bands to listen to, and along my way I stumbled upon this little gem. Pop-punk has never sounded so fresh! There are plenty of bands out there in this genre, sure, but Simple Plan bring a little extra to the table in this release. It's poppy, yet just punk enough to keep my interests. Get out there and get this CD if you like your punk melodic!
6304467575|5.0|This movie was unforgettable. The saga version is the most memorable for me because it combined the entire story the way the director would have done if he could have predicted its success. Too bad it is no longer available for future generations to enjoy...
0345448898|2.0|How could this be a book for fifth graders? I have worked with fifth graders and after reading this book, I would have to say that it is NOT for fifth graders. For instance, the book seems to attack authority and especially religion. It also suggests some homosexuality in the book and that it is fine, like a normal way of life, especailly between the two angels, Balthamos and Baurch. In the Bible, homosexuality is not welcomed and is considered a sin. Besides, would you want your child to be homosexual? Then, it suggests that Will and Lyra are more than friends and had a sexual relationship. But Will and Lyra are just children! Would you like your child to have a sexual relationship with another child? I know if I had a child, I would not. I think overall, that it is ok for a child to read this book as far as the fantasy is concerned, but with the issues I mentioned above, if I had a child, I would not let them read this book and I would find it a disgrace if they did.

B00005MM67|4.0|This movie is about two friends who are dedicated (not to say compulsive) mountain climbers.  It is based loosely on Lou Reichart and Jim Whitacker who were among the first four Americans to climb K2-probably the world's most difficult mountain.  The story is woven around the contrast and conflict between the two friends, one apparently being primarily self-oriented and the other believing in the importance of interpersonal responsibility.  The climbing is a useful vehicle because it makes plausible that a close relationship between two such dissimilar people could exist.  The mentality and mechanics of big mountain climbing are well depicted as the film moves to a resolution of its central issue.  The acting is competent and the depiction of the mountain climbing is excellent.  This movie is better than the obscurity into which it has sunken.  I suspect that it is because most people are simply unable to empathize with the motivation that would drive climbers to deliberately put themselves in a situation in which they have a 30% chance of dying.
B00005QZWI|4.0|This soundtrack strongly deserved its Oscar.  <br />Enya's two pieces are wonderful, though only \\"May It Be\\" stands alone.  Her other piece is part of track ten, \\"The Council of Elrond.\\"  This doesn't detract from it one bit.<br />Listening to individual tracks, one cannot help to identify with the portion of the movie it represents.  The happy shire music brings to mind Bilboa's birthday party; the tense \\"mine\\" music vividly leads to visualizations of the trek under the mountain with its constant danger of nothing less than a grisly death.  In those pieces, the hard sound of axe on rock is especially effective.  <br />Being able to identify with individual portions of the movie is not necessarily a good thing, though, if you're looking for a grandly sweeping soundtrack to which to relax during the drive home.  More likely you'll be clenching the steering wheel with both hands while the axe clangs on stone in the background of your vehicle, as stressed out as you were when you first watched the movie.  (For me, the movie was much more suspenseful than I had imagined it could be, even after being warned by the previews.)<br />All in all, an excellent soundtrack.
0684833395|5.0|When I first started to read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" I expected to get the typical war story.  I didn't think that it would offer me anything new because I have seen and read several war stories.  But as I progressed further into the book, I realized that this novel is unique and is unlike anything else I have ever read.<br />The novel is based around a bomb squadron stationed on a small island near Italy.  The main focus is on one of the members of the squadron named Yossarian, who is going insane because he is caught in the middle of World War II and people that he doesn't even know are trying to kill him.  Yossarian tries desperately throughout the novel to get out of the war, and along the way he meets up with many interesting characters.  And that is what makes this novel unique: the characters.  <br />Heller does an amazing job of developing every single person in the novel, giving them all a personality type of their own.  Every personality in the novel adds a little something to the story.  From Orr's obnoxious traits to Doc Daneeka's pessimistic outlook on life, all of the characters come together to show the horrifying truth of the madness of war.  If one of the characters was missing, the novel just wouldn't have the same impact.<br />The characters also do something besides helping to develop the story; they provide insight on many aspects of life.  The discussions between characters in this book made me realize many important things.  This book shows people that they shouldn't take things for granted or take advantage of people.  Heller does this by showing the effect that it had on the characters that did those things.  This novel is a real eye-opener.<br />Heller also achieves a feat that many other authors haven't: a perfect blend of horror and humor.  Although the novel is full of disgusting depictions of war, I often found myself chuckling.  And at some points, I laughed out loud, which is something I do only if I find something truly hilarious.For example, about halfway through the novel, Yossarian has to constantly look over his shoulder because he is being stalked by a prostitute who is trying to kill him for something that he didn't even do.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding novel.  Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" is a masterpiece that should be read by anyone and everyone.  It is a perfect blend of the horror and hilarity that is full of insight.  It's definitely one of the best novels that I have ever read.

Heller was a kind of writer who would produce something that his readers could enjoy from the bottom of their hearts.<BR>Many reviewers here and elsewhere tried so hard and too hard to make a serious solid stuff out of this book (i.e. trying to make it a masterpiece of twist philosophy..bla..bla...bla) which is actually just fine as long as they can still enjoy it.<BR>This is a lovely book. Please love it. You can criticize it anyway you like but please do not despise it.<br />And for those people who gave and will give this book less than 4 stars just because it couldn't satisfy their philosophical-twisted minds. All I can say is that they remind me of &quot;Clevinger&quot; who knew everything about literature exept how to enjoy it.
0399146369|5.0|The best of the Point of Origin, Black Notice, The Last Precinct trilogy, this book just cries out for another.

These people have become so dear to me since I have become an invalid  I would love to see and  know more about Kenneth Sparks.  Please, Patricia, complete this story or at least advance it so we can anticipate another.
0446608955|5.0|I read a walk to remember in two days. The book is one of the best I have ever read. When the movie came out I wanted to see it but first I wanted to read the book. The way Landon falls in love with Jamie is so touching. The book gets very sad at the end but when they get married that is the happiest part in it. I think if anyone wants to read a great book, to read this one, it's sad and will make you cry but it's also a glance at true love.

6305910103|5.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath of the Khan is considered to be one of the best Star Trek films.  First of all it gives rebirth to a classic TOS episode called &quot;The Space Seed&quot; in which a genetically engineer &quot;super-human&quot; is found in a tranport ship called the Botany Bay.  In Star Trek II, the remains of Botany Bay are found on a desolate planet, Ceti Alpha V, along with its contents....Khan and his fellow comrades.  Khan takes control of a Miranda-class cruiser called the USS Reliant.  He uses this cruiser to exact revenge upon Admiral Kirk who had left the Botany Bay abandoned on Ceti Alpha V.  He pursues the Enterprise to a Science Station called Regula One of which them a battle ensues.  Later the battle carries into a nebula, the Mutaris Nebula, in which sensors and weapons locks are useless.<br />However, coming later this summer, Paramount is working to put out a Director's Edition of this film, similar to The Motion Picture Director's Edition that came out last November.  Expect to see additional footage that was shown during an ABC TV showing and possibly some new enhanced visual effects.<br />Star Trek III will also be getting a Director's Edition later as  well.  Eventually all Trek films will be getting a Special treatment.
B00005JKBC|1.0|I think I could have enjoyed this movie if the captioning would stay turned off. After turning captioning off through the menu, it only stays off for a couple of minutes. Thought the first DVD was defective and returned it. The second one is doing the same thing. I decided to research this and found that it is a known problem--mostly with Toshiba players (which I have). I own other DVDs with captioning that do not turn on automatically.

B00005JKBB|2.0|&quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001)<br />I really hate to break it to you, but Spy Game is frankly a big disappointment. I was expecting a lot of this movie because it has the two of my favourite actors, Brad Pitt and Robert Redford. The trailer for this movie also looked excellent, and I was intrigued by the pairing of these 2 actors, who look so much alike and perform in the same style. This movie could've and should've worked given the talent working on the film. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, Spy Game is an exercise in boredom.<br />Fortunately, there are some good points, but I'll start with why I didn't like this movie. The main reason is because in some aspects the filmmakers have taken their audiences for dummies. I mean, come on, you could at least put a little makeup on Robert Redford. He looks exactly the same in the current part of the film as he did, what, like 30 years back? Brad Pitt also looks identical. The movie also moves along at a very slow pace, and the last half-hour was very boring and I didn't really care about the outcome of the film. The flashback sequences are the only really entertaining parts of the movie, the meetings and continuous talk in Washington started to really get to me, because a) I wasn't sure if Redford's colleagues were on his side, and b) there was just way too much blabber and not enough action.<br />I was also disappointed with the \\"spy\\" aspect of the film. This movie mostly just makes out a spy as a person who goes to different countries, sees different things and takes a heck of a lot of photos. I mean, the movie demonstrated the aspects of spying and going behind people's back better than Harriet the Spy, but I would've liked a deeper insight.<br />All that said, I loved the style of the movie. The zoom-all-around-the-place shots were very well done and I enjoyed how the movie did put in a mysterious atmosphere, whether it just used steam or smoke, or just a whole bunch of cool, different sort of shots. That's basically what this movie is - cool. Not in sense of story at all, but just in the way it looks. And that's what kept me in my seat. <br />Apart from of course the superb chemistry between Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, which manages to be a saving grace. I especially enjoyed the scenes were Redford was training Pitt's character to be a spy. Unfortunately that all ends too son. Anyway, Redford is not bad at all, and I don't usually like his acting. He proves to us he is not getting old fast, and he can still play a good action man. He isn't topped by the excellent Pitt, who comes across as charming, strong and interesting. I also enjoyed a little cameo by Charlotte Rampling.<br />There are good aspects of this movie, but they are overrun by the pace and timing of the movie. I wasn't really interested in the movie as a whole and it was a disappointment. Even worse, they had to throw in a horrid love story cliché. I can confirm overall that this isn't a game I'll want to be playing again anytime soon.<br />MY GRADE: C
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is one of the best Cd's that I have bought thus far.  There are only few Cd's that I can listen to every single track and like it.  This is one of those Cd's.   This CD is a must buy.  It is very soulful but unfortunately it did not get a lot of publicity.  DOn't get this CD burned, go out and buy it, support INDIA.ARIE.  PEACE
B0000636UN|4.0|This is an excellent album. A rarity in the fact that it has real guitars, guest stars,real singing, real production and it sounds like everyone was in the same room. Crow takes chances and crosses styles and for the most part it works.It may be a little long in the middle, but overall, this is a well crafted, well played, and well sung (very well) effort.Too many mid tempo songs make it drag a little (maybe the Henley duet is one ballad too many).For all the guest stars getting attention, the real secret weapon here is Doyle Bramhall who adds guitar  (a little too low in the mix) and vocals to a number of songs.Steve McQueen, Soak Up The Sun,Abilene, and Weather Channel are all top notch and the \\"weaker\\" songs are better than those on her previous albums.This one may be her best.
1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now, jumped at me from the bookshelf at the store. Something just made me buy this book. This book sets high expectations - \\"Spiritual Enlightment\\". Is it possible for mere words to guide us towards this goal? This book comes closer than anything else that I've read in long time.<br />Tolle seems to have that unmistakable stamp of the enlightened, expressing the deepest spiritual truths in the simplest way. Living in the \\"Now\\" is presented as the foundation for spiritual progress. The author offers practical advice on how we can expand our \\"presence\\" in the present moment. He discusses different gateways (what he calls \\"portals\\") which can get us in touch with our \\"Being\\" like, silence, dreamless sleep, connecting with the inner body, etc. We also get an insight into how relationships can be used as stepping stones on the spiritual path.<br />The author uses Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and other world religions to make his point, without affiliating himself with any of them. <br />The book is based on a simple question-and-answer format. The Power of Now is one of those books that can have a life-changing impact. A must buy.
B0000640VN|5.0|Wow!  I went into the theater expecting just another typical comedy-romance, but this tops the genre!  Leopold is the suave, kind and chivalrous man lost in time that every girl dreams of!  He is a dream brought to life, an ideal romance.  Okay, so Meg Ryan as Kate becomes a bit annoying after a while with her excessive perky/cute self, but is an easily ignored price for the rest of the movie.  Buy this movie!
0375703764|5.0|There are books you read and immediately forget. And there are books you read and know you'll always carry with you--&quot;On the Road&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, and now, &quot;House of Leaves.&quot;<br />Danielewski's genius is his deft mix of great storytelling, insightful emotional reckoning, and playful word games. He's obviously a great lover of words, and of the &quot;form = content&quot; critical literary stance. By arranging his book the way he did, he literally forces the reader through a parallel journey with the book's characters.<br />The comparison of this book to &quot;Blair Witch&quot; is understandable, but, utlimately, it's a comparison that doesn't do justice to &quot;House&quot;. &quot;Blair&quot; was a fun gimmick. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is a sincerely creepy journey through the unkown and unknowable, and, to the sensitive reader, will allow for a lifetime of exploration of exactly what the book forces you to explore--space; the space around you, and the space within you. You can't read the book without examining your own interior spaces, and this seems to be a major part of Danielewski's plan.<br />Read this book. Tell your friends.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The original soundtrack for LOTR is amazing!! Howard Shore has captured the essence of Tolkien in song. The music is not gaudy and overdone, but simple and elegant, flowing nicely with the movie and conveying many emotions. One of my favorite tracks is Track 2, Concerning Hobbits. This track is a delightful and fun tune that truly captures the playful spirit of hobbits! The music for Lothlorien truly captures the beauty and mystery of the elves. I commend Howard Shore for his beautiful work and am looking forward to the soundtracks for the next two movies.
B00004TJLD|1.0|Waste of money.  If you already have the audio CD don't bother with this one.  If you want an Alan Parsons Project album to listen to, go buy the group's DTS \\"On Air\\" album.  I am sure all you audiophiles out there will agree that the DTS version of \\"On Air\\" is money well spent.
B00005N9CV|3.0|If you're a Diana Krall fan, you'll buy this CD.  However, there's nothing in it that will surprise you. ...<br />There's really nothing new here.  If you were to slip this CD in with a few other of her prior CD's and randomize the playlist, you'd hardly notice these songs when they come up.  Being buried under mounds of strings, her voice doesn't rise above the languid setting. Which is a shame, really, because she is such an incredible talent.  I was anticipating the CD to contain a handful of highly polished gems, which can always be reliably found on each of her earlier recordings, but which are missing here.<br />I don't suggest passing on this CD, but if you've been spending a lot of time with her earlier work, you won't see her showing  any new sides on this one.<br />Give it a spin - great sound, tremendous voice, nothing new.<br />Big fan, but a bit bummed with this one.
0471603864|5.0|This textbook makes the somewhat esotoeric subject of particle physics totally accessible to an undergraduate. Griffiths style of writing naturally and using personal pronouns should be adopted by more physics text book authors. This book takes you from having only a vague understanding of the subject to getting into some really hairy calculations that are fundamental to the standard model.

B000001GK0|5.0|I compared almost 30 interpretations of the Schumann piano concerto and ended up with 3 : Abbado/Pires, Karajan/Zimerman and a surprising one : &quot;Robert Schumann: Meisterwerke Zum Kennenlernen&quot; with the czech pianist Marian Lapsansky. 1) Pires plays with so much delicacy and introspection, the flow of keytrokes is seamless : very refreshing and compelling esp. for the 1st &amp; 2nd movement. 2) Zimerman displays great virtuosity without playing too fast,  esp. in the 3rd movement which is arresting.  3) the czech interpretation lays in-between. I was surprised an unknown interpretation could be that good.
B00005QZWI|5.0|As I said, the soundtrack is amazing.  Howard Shore can rest assured that he's created a great work of art with this.  I love Enya and she ties it all in with her incredibly soothing voice.  I can't help it, i just have to say, i love it.  I listen to it every night it's that good
0452282152|3.0|I did enjoy Girl with a Pearl Earing.  I thought the characters were well written and true to life.  However, if you were looking for a story of scandal (a painter having an affair with his young maid) you won't find it.  This is that classic tale of first love, one-way-street love, and love that can never be.  It's a story about settling for second best, being trapped by your class, and the grass-is-always-greener feeling.  Though the Girl in question has a strong backbone, she too suffers from the imobilization that love, lust, and infatuation give us.  <BR>I did enjoy reading the book, but the hype and descriptions written about it mislead my expectations.
B00005QK3W|5.0|The album that he has been trying to record in years...DRIVING RAIN is a fine example of those great McCartney tunes...I feel it is ranked up there with BAND ON THE RUN, personally, and the songs are strong, and well performed...he had to get through some choppy terrain in the eighties to finally make a triumphant return to form...FLOWERS IN THE DIRT is a great album...but CHOBA B CCCP: THE RUSSIAN ALBUM,FLAMING PIE and RUN DEVIL RUN, all paved the way for DRIVING RAIN. This album is about as anything as raw on THE BEATLES ABBEY ROAD album...and his band is perhaps one of the best line-ups, since WINGS circa 1976. Now, that Paul has triumphed over some personal trials, he always makes his best music out of tragedy, and this past year shows that Paul is still here there and everywhere...and always was.
B000003BF4|5.0|This album has stood the test of time.  Always has been, always will be not only the best Stones album, but one of the best live rock albums on the planet.  Mick Taylor made it that way.  Stones and Taylor in their prime.  Worth ten times whatever you pay for it.
B00000JMQC|5.0|My older sister and I always liked this movie. It was nothing like the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\", but it was still very, very good. Fairuza Balk portrays a Dorothy Gale who clearly looks much younger than the Dorothy that Judy Garland carried out in the original. Basically, the sequel picks up the story several months after the \\"tornado\\" that propelled Dorothy to Oz for the first time in the original. Little Dorothy is having trouble sleeping, and her Aunt Em is worried about her because she can't seem to stop talking about a fanciful place called Oz. Determined to restore Dorothy to her old self and make her forget about Oz, Aunt Em takes Dorothy to a therapist who plans to snap the child back into reality with some wacky machine. Left alone with the therapist and his witch-like assistant, Dorothy is suddenly grabbed and pulled to safety in Oz by a mysterious young girl. Now that she is back in Oz, Dorothy is looking forward to revisiting the beautiful land and all of her friends--the Scarecrow, Tinman, and Cowardly Lion. However, Oz is not the same as it was when she left it--her beloved friends have been turned to stone, and she is confronted with an array of new enemies--the evil Princess Mombi, a team of \\"Wheelers,\\" and some sort of \\"stone\\" character who is Dorothy's only hope in rescuing the Tinman, Lion, and Scarecrow. Luckily, Dorothy also has a group of new friends to help her along the way, including a kindly robot named \\"Tick-Tock,\\" a talking pet chicken named Bellina, and a troubled \\"Jack Pumpkinhead,\\" whose features can most likely be guessed =)All in all, this is an enjoyable movie with many good points, but I can understand how it can be a little frightening for young children. There is a scene where Princess Mombi leads the dumbfounded Dorothy into a long room with a variety of different heads individually placed in glass cases. Apparently, Mombi has stolen these heads from real women and is able to pull her own head off and wear any other head she wants, obviously to deceive others and cater to her various moods. This film does not have the same magic that you might expect after seeing the original \\"Wizard Of Oz\\"--for instance, the Scarecrow is the only one of Dorothy's 3 original friends who talks, and the talking chicken can get a bit annoying at times. But, it is still a good movie. I recommend it for kids 9 and older.
0451169514|5.0|IT is not a scary book, but then, Steven King does not write scary books. He does however, write entertaining books, and this one is a page-turner. King really is a master storyteller, and can make a story that seems silly or uninteresting into something quite intriguing. I was not exactly engaged at the idea of a killer clown, but picked the book up because there is really very little good horror out there and because of the strengths of King's other works. The book has a Lovecraftian feel, both because of the pervasive nature of the madness that afflicts the town and it's obvious origin `somewhere else'. I am also no fan of `cute kids' in movies or books, but King draws them so faithfully and gives enough dimension to make them both admirable and believable. King switches back and forth between the kid story (in the fifties) and the story of the grown ups (in the eighties). The device is very useful because each time he switches you are dying to know what is about to happen and wishing that he wouldn't switch each time he does it. This makes the book quite addictive. The story is also very surprising. My favorite bits were the tales of yesteryear that Mike discovers when researching the history of IT, the long history of terror and discovery of it by a main character are part and parcel of the Lovecraftian style. All in all, highly recommended.
0375507507|5.0|I can't believe some of the criticisms of this wonderful book.  As a white woman who grew up in Zim - even though I was a few years older and lived in town - it captured exactly what it was (is) like.  The matter of fact descriptions are powerful on their own - would you expect a 13 year old girl to be making a studied analysis of the political forces at work?  The point is that Fuller manages to describe vividly events which fit into that world and give you a richer understanding of it.  There are good novels and historic/political books from other perspectives, but that does not mean that her perspective is invalid. Try reading some of the dry as dust ones like Cathy Buckle's account of the current experiences of white farmers (written from a very liberal, politically correct standpoint) and see which gives you a better insight.    <br />By the way, for the reviewer her questioned her teapot metaphor - has he/she ever looked at a map of Zimbabwe?
B000001EUN|1.0|The Scorpions exemplified all the excesses and imperfections of 70s metal. The misogynist cover says it all. Scream on boys.
0783229321|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time!  It shows an exaggerated version of America as it should be ... not this repressed, over-litigated Hell in which we live today.
B00005QEO1|2.0|`Janie's Got A Gun' is really the only reason to buy this album, the other hit `Love In An Elevator' is a dubious asset at best. The rest of the album is loud unexceptional metal typical of the band at the time. At the time this was considered a great come back album from a band that was a master of the art, however, in retrospect, it seems mere pandering to the sound and the politics of the time. Stick to the seventies stuff, as for `Janie' you can probably get it on a comp
B000002J03|5.0|Albums do not get much more classic than Led Zeppelin II. Released over 30 years ago, it still sounds as energetic and thunderous as it did upon first release. How could you not like the impeccible lineup of tracks, all of which are certified radio classics? Led Zeppelin II not only revolutioned rock music, but inspired countless rip-offs that tried but failed to catch up to Zeppelin's ahead-of-its-time style and sound. From the immortal opening riffs of the timeless Whole Lotta Love to the screeching finale of Bring It On Home, this album is flawless. VH1's joke of a greatest album list rated this in the 40s, but real rock fans know better. There are few collections that are without this masterpiece, and none should be.
B00005J9LY|3.0|The Boys were kings of synth pop back in the eighties, and their music has aged a little better than average for the genre, but that doesn't make it worth listening to. The album is best remembered as the source of monster hits `West End Girls' `Opportunities (Let's Make Lots Of Money)' and `Suburbia'. Even fans of the band would be better served by a comp.
B000003CMB|5.0|Believe all the praise you've heard about this live set, because it's truly one of the best live albums ever. The Allman Brothers jam to perfection on blistering numbers that rival and surpass their studio counterparts. The highlights are Statesboro Blues, Hot'Lanta, and of course, the 20 minute plus rendition of Whipping Post. Blues rock has never sounded better live. Afficianados of live albums should find this gem worth every penny.
B000002572|3.0|If you listen to classic rock stations, you probably think you own this album already. Every song on it has been overplayed since the seventies, when Boston's brand of corporate arena rock sounded exciting. The album plays like a greatest hits, but it's not a greatest hits I ever want to hear. If you don't know what the band sounds like, you're probably living on the moon. If you like them, this is probably all of their music you'll ever need, all their other albums are blander, duller and less interesting, as unbelievable as that seems, let us all thank gOd that the seventies are over.
B00001XT76|5.0|I really loved the music in this film.  I also thought the acting was very good.
B000001Y79|5.0|&quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; is my favorite No Doubt CD. I love all of the songs. Of course, &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; &quot;Return of Saturn,&quot; &quot;No Doubt,&quot; and &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; were excellent as well, but this is my favorite. Here's my review for each song:<br />1. &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; - The first single from the album, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; is a good song. All of the lyrics on each track are wonderful, and this one is no exception. The music is superb too.<br />2. &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; - A fast, upbeat song with a cool piano solo.<br />3. &quot;Just A Girl&quot; - The second single from the album, &quot;Just A Girl&quot; was probably the most popular No Doubt song, with the possible exception of &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; and it truly deserves it. It's a great song about being young and just a girl, but not being happy with the fact.<br />4. &quot;Happy Now?&quot; - A wonderful song in which Gwen sings the question of &quot;Are you happy now?&quot; after he broke up with her.<br />5. &quot;Different People&quot; - One of my favorite songs on the albumb, even though they're all awesome, this song is about all of the different people in the world.<br />6. &quot;Hey You&quot; - A unique sound that includes a citar, a strange instrument, &quot;Hey You&quot; is great, with good lyrics and good music.<br />7. &quot;The Climb&quot; - Superb lyrics and appropriate music, this song is about perserverance and life, I'm assuming. Great.<br />8. &quot;Sixteen&quot; - As No Doubt gets a little more metalish, Gwen sings pitifully for someone who's finally turned sixteen but is still treated with no respect.<br />9. &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; - The fourth and last single on the album, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; is excellent with the music and the lyrics. A great song.<br />10. &quot;Don't Speak&quot; - A slow, but majestic song, &quot;Don't Speak&quot; was the third single off the album, and one of the most popular No Doubt songs. Wonderful.<br />11. &quot;You Can Do It&quot; - A seventies-ish and encouraging song, the title basically explains the message behind the song. It's a really good song, one of my favorites.<br />12. &quot;World Go 'Round&quot; - A ska-ish song about how &quot;we got to find another way to make the world go 'round.&quot;<br />13. &quot;End It On This&quot; - With obvious piano in the music, the lyrics to this song are great in portraying the message of wanting to end a relationship.<br />14. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; - A highly-instrumental song, and the title track for the album, this song is a parody of the &quot;Magic Kingdom,&quot; also known as DisneyLand in Anaheim, California, the hometown of the fabulous No Doubt. It views the Magic Kingdom tragically, as the title hints, and it's a good song. The ending concludes the song with a gradually faster continuation of the chorus until finally all of the instruments crash into one big, loud sound and are &quot;broken.&quot;

B000002G7G|5.0|This is the most underrated of all the velvet underground's albums and it just might be the best. Yes, its probably impossible to truely decide which one is the best because they are all fantastic, but this is a damn good one. Every song on the album is great. What Goes On is the most covered alternative song ever. Every alternative band that doesnt stink has covered it. Okay thats not true, but a lot of people cover it. Pale Blue Eyes is a mega classic, beginning to see the light rocks, its all good. This is one of the greatest albums of all time...blah blah. I was tired when I was writing this.

B00001QEBQ|4.0|Just to help anyone who cares to know, there are no &quot;Huns&quot; in this movie. The Huns were a Germanic tribe who ransacked and raided in Europe - the Han are a Chinese ethnic group whose ancestors set out to conquer the nation during this movie's time period. I blame Disney for not giving a little intro at the beginning of the flick to explain this - I'm also upset that the Han were only shown as a pack of yellow-eyed barbarians, because the Han dynasty of China was a period of definate advancement in culture and the arts. So there.
B00003CXE6|5.0|I agree with everyone's review on this movie, it's enthawing! This is the movie everyone should view as I've seen it more then several times, and right now HBO is showing it again and I do not tire of Russell Crowe's excellent performance as he and he alone makes the character General Maximus believable at epic proportions and it's no wonder he won an award for his performance here. Hollywood take notice - Don't let Crowe's talent get away from you or us, here. And the tabloids are just that - gossip. If Russel Crowe reads this, remember that it's when they &quot;stop&quot; talking about you that you're in trouble! Besides, everyone &quot;should&quot; know that above average intelligent people are always a bit more.... &quot;interesting&quot;. - 5 Star Rating from me and can anyone  tell...??!!?? Yes, Crowe is my idol now, bar none! Sure would like to meet him... hint hint!
B00005LQ04|1.0|The idea of a ballet school hiding a coven of witches sounds like rich fodder for an atmospheric horror film (I imagined it as a cross between Rosemary's Baby and Don't Look Now), but Suspiria is a terrible movie.  I admit that some of the imagery is moderately unsettling, and the first twenty minutes had me alarmed, but Dario Argento wastes all his energy on gaudy, day-glow sets (not at all frightening, just tacky) and loopy, labored death sequences that are never effective.  The excessive, fake-ish gore is neither harrowing nor gleefully exuberant, it's just tedious and stupid.  The plot is incoherent, and not in a good way--I have no problem with movies that follow dream logic or sacrifice common sense for cinematic effect, but this one is just a cluttered, sloppy mess that stumbles forward in fits and starts.  The terrible dubbing was irritating; I don't know whether there were multiple dialogue tracks recorded for this film but the one presented on this DVD is awful.  I like Jessica Harper very much, but she's wasted (except for the googly eyes, which are put to good effect).  Lots of potential in the premise, but terribly executed; all of Argento's over-the-top-and-off-the-cliff pyrotechnics are just distracting, not scary.  The final sequence is hysterically funny, an orgy of cheap gross-out horror effects that doesn't make any sense or build upon the \\"story\\" up to that point.  And then that's it--it just ends.  Avoid.

I can see deeper than most of my friends, and I feel things that they cannot relate to. The giver was an excellent source for me to experience life from someone elses view, to show it's not just me- or you, that feel... different
B000003S16|4.0|...BR><br />...and still not get his number. This is King Crimson's leader the way you'd expect him to sound in a solo effort. He throws you a few curves like the punkish \\"You Burn Me Up, I'm a Cigarette\\" or the micro-play \\"NY3\\" involving a dysfunctional family screaming at each other over a hardcore soundtrack, he comes across pedantic and pompous in liner notes he writes for himself--but then he goes and completely turns a whole track of this album over to another artist. The two-part \\"Water Music\\" is a \\"frippertronics\\" composition, but the song it brackets, \\"Here Comes the Flood\\", is all Peter Gabriel on voice and solo piano, which doesn't appear in that form on any of Gabriel's own albums until the \\"Shaking the Tree\\" anthology. So \\"arrogant\\" obviously isn't really the right word for Robert Fripp. Go figure.
B000056N8X|1.0|Normally I'm not a purist when it comes to film, meaning I'm not normally one of those people who constantly decries sequels as lacking everything that made the original great.  I loved The Phantom Menace; I loved Hannibal; I thought the Prophecy sequels were great (ok, so 2 was mediocre, but 3 was brilliant!); and I'm often quick to defend such films against (what I perceive as) knee-jerk negativity from people who had unrealistic expectations.  <br />That all said, when it comes to Highlander, I am a total purist. The first film was a masterpiece, and none of the sequels has come anywhere close to matching it for beauty, simplicity and brilliance.  Highlander 2 was a terrible sequel, completely rewriting the whole mythology!  Highlander 3 was made, in my opinion, to apologise for Highlander 2, and so just tried to copy the original film in order to try and recapture some of the magic.  It succeeded in this marginally better than the second film.<br />The tv series was ok, although I never did gel with the alternate timeline of \\"Connor Macleod DIDN'T actually win the prize when he killed the Kurgan\\".  And taking this new \\"timeline\\" into the movies with Endgame completely ruined it for me.  Continuing to drastically change the premise of a movie with each successive sequel is a sign of desperation, and a sign not to expect too much from these sequels in my opinion.  This is a movie of the series, with an awkward cameo by Christopher Lambert, and it has no place being that connected (as it is by Lambert's presence) to the original film.  For those who just watch the movies, and either didn't watch or didn't stay with the series, this film is a baffling ordeal to watch.  Well, it was for me anyway.<br />And the blatant JVC product placement while Connor and Duncan were fighting was laughable.  <br />Sorry, this film was just a huge disappointment for me.
B00005RY7X|1.0|I just saw him on Saturday Night Live and the guy is like a caricature of Dee Snider a generation later, no bull. Convulsing around onstage, his hair flopping like a housewife shaking out her dustmop, and you probably need this disc's liner notes to know what he's singing--in the case of both songs on SNL, the vocals were totally unintelligible. The keyboardist's use of an upright acoustic piano in one song provides one point of interest--during the days of Twisted Sister, use of keyboards at all was considered to be prima facie evidence of a band's effeteness. I heard somewhere that Andrew is a classically-trained pianist--maybe that's why the ivories. That same number opens with an odd \\"robot voice\\" that might be notable, were it not for the fact that Jon Bon Jovi already did it, ELO did it before him, Kool & the Gang did it before them, Peter Frampton did it before them, and Kraftwerk based a whole album on it before him. Been there, done that, in an exponential sense of the phrase. But the basic sound back in Twisted Sister's day was called \\"thrash\\"--a fusion of metal and punk. Ten years later, the same thing was called \\"grunge\\". Do they have a current term these days? Hell if I know. My own term for the sound remains the same over two decades: \\"nana music\\". You know--ya gotcha bassist, ya gotcha drummer, and up front are two guitarists, only one of whom is necessary because they're both playing the same thing. Sometimes one is the lead singer, which you can maybe understand, because maybe he's one of those dudes without good moves, self-conscious about it, so he needs a prop. So the other axman taught him some chords. In this case, though, Andrew is the singer and he just has a mike and no problem with his moves. But the whole arrangement sounds something like this: \\"NANA-NANA-NANA-NANA-NANA!!!\\" That's how it was 20 years ago, and it's like that old Nostradamus saying; \\"The more things change, the more they remain the same.\\"

But in all honesty this is one of the best Collections of songs I've ever seen on a CD. sure there are a lot of song that are not on there but the songs that are will just blow you AWAY!This CD will appeal to folks from all over. Punk/hardcore to goth to metal. This is the CD you want to listen to on your way home from a really really bad day at work!
B00005YW4H|5.0|One word for this CD : refreshing. Not to sell Norah short, but it reminds me of the feel good mood music that is played in the coffee shops while we sip our hot mocha coffees. You know that feeling you get when you sit in a comfy chair having a great coversation about life and there is some great music in the background? This is the music that is being played. This CD is a great way to start you mornings after a good night of sleep and a fantastic way to wind down into the night time. It reminds me of a spring day or a warm night under the stars. Her voice and music reminds me of a cross between Alanna Davis and Billie Holiday. Anyone that wants to escape a stressful days need to get a copy of this.
B00005MP58|5.0|The whole genre of chick lit has been around for awhile, but the grand dames of chick lit is non-other than Jane Austen herself.<br />For anyone how has read &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; and their counterparts, rent this dvd on the story that started it all -- such as Helen Fielding readily admits how she got the idea for BJD in the first place was from this particular book.<br />The miniseries was, simply incredible. The settings, the costumes everything seemed complete down to the littlest detail. The series stayed fairly true to the book, and the ending was enhanced more so than the book which made the story seem even more wonderful.<br />Anyone who has seen BJD, will note that the Mr. Darcy in BJD is the same gentlemen (Colin Firth) who plays Mr. Darcy in 'Pride &amp; Prejudice'.  This was, by no means, a coincidence as interviews with Fielding stated that Firth was choosen for the BJD role because  he was Mr. Darcy in PP.<br />At any rate, anyone who has read/seen BJD or any related books will adore this movie.
0553210246|4.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge has so many plot twists and turns that it would not be an exaggeration to label this book as a \\"plot spiral.\\"  With practically every new section, Hardy invents a new way to reveal some surprising (and sometimes not so surprising) twist to the plot line.  Hardy creates a complex story about love, lust, relationships, economical hardship, family, shifts in power, and more in a beautiful and picturesque way.  He concentrates so much on detail that it seems as if you are watching the events first hand.  His style presents information as if you were reading it in the form of a play.  He nearly always sets up the scene before beginning the action, which makes it so much easier to delve deeply into the action of the characters.<br />Hardy also creates enormously dynamic characters that are subject to so many changes throughout the novel that they become like real people.  The author's grip on human emotions makes his characters believable and easily loved and then hated.  The fluctuating emotions of the main character, Michael Henchard, as he falls subject to disappointment in every avenue of his life is a true example of Hardy's gift for characterization.<br />The contrast of the out-dated and underdeveloped town of Casterbridge vs. the complexity of the relationships that develop within it is brilliant and makes the reactions of the common townspeople to these relationships even more significant to the development of the setting and also the relationships themselves.  Though not portrayed obviously in the book, the town of Casterbridge itself plays a very large role in the story.  As Hardy thrusts outsiders from other cultures into this archaic town, things suddenly become very complicated and even more so when the newcomers begin to meet and mix together.  The Scotchman, Farfrae, and Lucetta, the Jersey girl, as well as some others, react in such a way to the old ways of this society as to disrupt the harmony of this simple community, making this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the characters point of origin.<br />Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death.  I must say that I enjoyed this novel for its substance and complexity, as well as the timelessness of the general plot outline.ng this novel an avenue for Hardy to demonstrate his gift for rich dialogue and language, as created in direct relation to the characters point of origin.  <br />Hardy has created a book about rises and downfalls of a small group of people and presents a very fitting theme about the events of ones life and how they affect everyone around them in death.

B000059H99|5.0|Rocky is one of the best motion pictures made.Sylvestor Stallone's acting was excellent.

The producers even went as high as three hundred thousand dollars but his philosophy was that he had managed poverty like a science so to continue living the way he was living didn't matter, but playing Rocky did. On the disc I bought there is a Sylvestor Stallone video commentary and on it he states that originally the producers wanted either Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal or Robert Redford to play Rocky. I think if one of those actors did play Rocky and Sly didn't, I feel that they would've only played him once for some reason and the next time around the producers would have had to find alternate actors for the sequels and that would have reduced the impact of the films. <BR>The characters in Rocky are great too.

B00003CXTF|2.0|What's this world coming to?? How can you not see how blatantly horrible this movie is?? Me giving this movie 2 stars is being VERY kind.<br />There's so much wrong with this movie I don't know where to start!<br />Maybe I'll start with the cliched love triangle. Or how predictible this movie is?<br />This movie could have been so much better if, put a bit more focus on the Japanese, and the planning of the attack. It could have been better if the love story didn't take up half the movie. It could have been better if the focus of the movie was actually the attack on Pearl Harbor, as opposed to the stupid love story. It could have been better if the people in the movie actually acted at their full potential.<br />The worst part about this movie was how they made the Americans look godly. I read another review someone wrote here, it involved the part where the British guy said \\"if the rest of them back home are as good as you...then I welcome them to the war\\" and he said he could detect a bit of patriotism. What I detected was Americans making themselves look like they were the only making an impact against the Nazis, which is simply not true.<br />This movie could have been over, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor...<br />But no...<br />They can't stand going out on a losing note so they go into the whole Dolittle operation. In this scene, we find Alec Baldwin giving one of the cheesiest, most poorly acted speeches I have ever seen, my sister was in hysterics while he was giving his speech.<br />So much more wrong with this movie...but I only have a thousand words :)

B00005B1W5|4.0|Already owning the CD and the video, I was glad I could buy the DVD version of Tribute. Deliverance is without a doubt the best track on this DVD, combining great rhythms, string orchestra, chants by the female vocalists and marvellous melodies and native instruments into a beautiful composition. This track alone is more than worth the price of the DVD.<br />Adagio In G Minor is a very soundtrack-like piece with piano and string orchestra. Renegade is sort of a soprano saxophone/violin duet.<br />Dance With A Stranger is a piece where various instruments  play a short solo. A very relaxed and laid-back piece. Tribute is another highlight with  vocals in the intro, followed by some beautiful violin playing accompanied by a choir. Very classical oriented.<br />Prelude a short piece with native instruments. After a couple of minutes this piece goes into Love is All, which is one of the two only tracks with lyrics on the album. Accompanied by Spanish guitar this is a rather radio-friendly tune with great soulful vocals and the full choir.Southern Exposure starts another laid back tune with female backing vocals, saxophone and violin. Later on in the song things get more rhythmic and swinging with nice interplay between the violins and female vocalists. Next in line is Waltz In 7/8 then. Great piece of work with flutes, latin influences and a keyboard solo. Nightingale is probably one of the quietest songs on the DVD.It features some bird like flute-playing with a slight Japanese feeling. Of course the big string orchestra is present as well.<br />Niki Nana (We're One) starts with the native sounds of a didgeridoo. After about half a minute the electric band picks up, a flute plays and the vocalists start. Marvellous song. In addition to the CD version the DVD and video version end with the track Santorini, from the Live at the Acropolis album, which equals the track Deliverance for me in giving me goose bumps all over my body. The DVD as well as the video contains also \\"the making of\\" and this part is really well worth watching because it shows more of the ecstatic reactions of the audience itself and gives you insight in Yannis life. The whole show itself is a pleasure to watch. The fun the members of the band have in performing their music is great to see and gets you in a good mood as well.The only thing I see as a disappointment is the  fact that the DVD was not released in the Dolby 5.1 surround mode.

B00003CXC6|1.0|There may have been a bad bunch run off by Criterion.<br />I bought the Special Edition... on April 13.<BR>That copy had the picture breaking up very badly in the middle of Chapter 10. <BR>I returned the disc on April 19 and was given another. <br />The second copy also breaks up at the same place<BR>(Chapter 10 - 1 hr, 10 min, 29 or 30 seconds into the movie).<br />Twice in a row sounds like a fault in the pressing. Be warned.<br />(The rating only refers to the problem in the disk. I cannot praise the movie enough. This was one I was looking forward to on DVD and I hope they find and fix the problem soon so I can buy a better copy.)<br />Follow-up, 23 Apr 2002...  <BR>Criterion has been unable to duplicate this problem, <BR>and so far no one else has mentioned anything like this.  <br />I cannot rule out a problem with the player, but have reasons to consider it highly unlikely. That player (Panasonic RV-31) has been quite reliable and handles disks that would not even play on an earlier Sony machine.  <br />However, Criterion DID get back to me and said that they had tried, on in-house machines.<br />I will try again, with a copy from another store in case <BR>this is a real problem confined to a very few disks.<br />So, I stand by my warning, but suggest you try the disk, anyway.  <br />The rest of the disk is truly excellent, and if you get <BR>through chapter 10 without any problems, mine may have <BR>been a freak occurance.
B00005JKEC|5.0|There's non-stop action and non-stop violence in this remarkable police story as the big bad narcotics cop, played by Denzel Washington, trains a rookie, played by Ethan Hawke, as to the ways of the street.  Set it Los Angeles, the audience visits the hoods of the gangs as these two cops experience more activity in this one day than most cops experience in a lifetime.  Young Ethan Hawke is shocked over and over again as Denzel not only doesn't play by the book, but turns from simply being streetwise into an exaggerated symbol of the baddest of the bad.  And, even after the film goes to such extremes that reality is completely lost, I was still riveted to my seat as I experienced the wildest, most violent police drama I've ever seen.<br />The plot twists and turns and gradually unveils Denzel as a person to hate, even though there are moments when he can be admired.  I can well understand why he won an academy award for best actor for his thrilling performance. It's a shame that the plot gets a bit hazy during the last 15 minutes of the film, because, until then I had no trouble with it.  But, by that time it doesn't matter.  I was on the roller coaster ride already and there was nothing to do but hold on tight and go along for the ride.  For those who don't mind a huge dose of violence with a story that goes to extremes, this is for you.  It is pure entertainment and will make you forget all your own problems.  I loved it!
1565847032|5.0|The ten chapters of this book compile question and response material taken from talks Chomsky delivered throughout the 1990s.  The chapters are conveniently marked where the topic shifts, so that if you want to look up Chomsky's views on a particular issue, you easily can.  Everything in this book is still extremely relavent.  Even if you think you've heard it all before and have read a lot of other Chomsky books, it is still inspiring to read Chomsky and this book is perfect to have around as a refresher.  It is also the perfect introduction for those who are beginning to have an interest in progressive politics.  All of the classic wit, wisdom, logic, (incredible memory skills) and integrity of Noam Chomsky come shining through in this collection.  (For those who have only heard the name of Chomsky slandered and ridiculed, I encourage you to read through some of this book and ask yourself, why is it that nobody ever really addresses Chomsky's arguments, but will profusely attack him with ad hominem denunciations?)  Of all the Chomsky books I have read, this one is the most definitive.
0307120007|5.0|Some things become life experiences not only for one's child, but for oneself. \\"Pat the Bunny\\" is such a book. It is so dear, so simple, and so very, very perfect that it is deceptive. It really can teach a very young baby about textures and colors and the fact that the world is a varied and wonderful place.<br />When my first child (now almost 18) was less than 6 months old, I would take her tiny hand and place her chubby fingers on each different texture...the bunny, the cloth, and of course my favorite...Daddy's scratchy beard! (a piece of sandpaper). I don't know how much of the simple and sweet words my daughter absorbed, but she was cuddled in my arms, being rocked (our favorite place to read) and she definitely liked to touch the textures. Now the interesting thing is that the book remained special, and when she should have outgrown it, she did not. It remained in the collection. I think that's because it is just so peaceful and simple, remnants of a former time.<br />If you are expecting, if one of your friends has a new baby, if you are a grandparent or a loving aunt or uncle, you cannot give a better book for a new baby. It will be that baby's cherished book in short order. Guaranteed. One word of warning, though. Make sure that you are buying the original, with all the textures. I saw one oversized board book version the other day, and its only texture was the cotton of the bunny, which carried through to each page. No no!! We need everything right for this book of a lifetime.
6301763041|5.0|CryBaby is a clever satire with everything that a movie should have. Let's face it, every girl wants to be fought over by two hot guys (especially if one is Johnny Depp). The script is witty, the songs are amazing, and the acting is outstanding. I could watch this movie every day for the rest of my life without getting sick of it. I find myself singing the catchy songs around the house. CryBaby takes an ordinary storyline of the good girl falling for the bad boy, and spices it up with music, dancing, and interesting sub-plots. The contrast between the &quot;squares&quot; and the &quot;drapes&quot; (the good girls and boys and the rebels) is hysterical; everything in the movie is hysterical. CryBaby is destined to become a classic.
B00005LMBK|3.0|I bought this after seeing the three animated music videos for 19/2000, Tomorrow Comes Today, and Clint Eastwood. The singles were unbelievably good, and I'd venture to say that there was at least one other great song on the album. Unfortunately, the majority of the songs on the cd did not live up to my expectations. The Gorillaz is really an experimental type of band, and a lot of the music shows it. While I applaud the daring and effort the album took, it really did not stand up as well as the singles did on their own.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Filmed in Australia, but set in Paris in 1899, this 2001 musical stars Nicole Kidman as Satine, a beautiful courtesan who is in love with a penniless writer played by Ewan McGreggor. However, a jealous duke wants Satine for his own.  Complications follow in this extremely stylized musical extravaganza that combines original music with familiar songs from the seventies in an outlandish fantasy of color and sound.  It reminded me a bit of The Rocky Horror Picture show and Can Can and La Boheme, all rolled into one.  Parts of it play like a music video with extra quick cuts and the characters all larger than life and caricatures of themselves.  At first I hated it.  The story seemed silly, the acting overdone, and the special effects distracting.  It all seemed discordant, the sets too full of glitz and glitter and the makeup too outrageous. At this point, I nearly shut off the video and went back to reading a book.<br />However, as the film rolled on, I got into it.  The acting was excellent and Nicole Kidman somehow emerged beyond her stereotype.  I found myself rooting for the good guys and felt sympathy for the ill-fated lovers.  I hummed the familiar tunes such as \\"The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music,\\" \\"Nature Boy,\\" \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,\\" \\"Material Girl\\", \\"All You Need is Love,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" and \\"Like a Virgin.\\"  And I enjoyed their staging in their new and fresh presentations.  I sat there fascinated and just simply let myself enjoy.  Then I realized that, as a whole, Moulin Rouge works.  It's not real, and it's not supposed to be.  It's just a big fun musical romp.<br />I know I would have enjoyed it more on a big screen or even on a DVD however.  Video just doesn't do it justice.  But do see it if you can.  It's pure entertainment.  So just sit back and enjoy!
0393317552|1.0|This book is highly informative and interesting. Nevertheless, Diamond reiterates the secular position on religion. To the so-called secular intellectuals, religion is a secondary, strange, difficult-to-understand phenomenon. Religion evolved to unify the masses and justify the invasion of others. This point of view is extremely reductionist as religion is very fundamental to humans. Despite the secular anticipation that religion will decline steadily, the World nowadays is as religious as in the past if not more. There are several reasons for this:<BR>1. Secularism undermines the always taken-for-granted certainties. Darwinism (one of the scientific wings of secularism) is said to have shattered human vanity by revealing that we humans are just the unintentional byproduct of the alleged evolutionary processes. In this sense, our existence, our free will and our consiousness all evolved my chance!!! The majority of people detest being in a state of uncertainty. <BR>2. On the other hand religion presents answers to the fundamental questions of our existence. Some religions look very irrational but some of them appeal to the intellect and provide a self-consistent framework for our existence. These religions spread enormously in the World today.<BR>3. Secular arrogance tries to present religious people as ignorant, gullible, and marginalized. On the contrary, many religious people are highly educated professionals who pondered hard over the deepest philosophical questions and reached belief through a long process of rationalization.<BR>In short, the book depends on evolution theory too much to study history, belittles religion, and turns history into a mere deterministic process.

Ben Stiller is one clever guy.
B00005JKJA|4.0|...<BR>The real, actual story does not begin until right after Rita/Camilla gets [pulled] into the blue box (possibly meant to symbolize a screen/movie/TV) and The Cowboy tells the corpse on the bed to wake up (as Diane, who \\"Betty\\" has been all along).  In simplest form: Betty/Diane was a so-so actress and star-wannabe who lost out on a part to Rita/Camilla and was jealous of her.  The two of them did become friends (from Rita/Camilla's perspective) and did mess with a lesbian relationship (which Betty/Diane took very seriously and which Rita/Camilla did not take so seriously).  Betty/Diane became increasingly dejected at her botched sexual relationship as well as her jealousy for the way Hollywood works for people like Rita/Camilla.  Betty/Diane was briefly thrilled (I think) to hold Rita/Camilla's hand as they walked through the brush up to the party, but she was immediately horrified to realize Rita/Camilla was to marry Adam, the director.  In fact, Betty/Diane was so hurt that she decided<BR>to hire the assassin to kill Rita/Diane so that she could get on with her own life.  The hitman said Betty/Diane would receive the blue key once the hit had taken place.  She receives the key, but then it's discovered that the hit hasn't gone as planned and \\"the girl is missing\\" (which is what takes place at the technical beginning of the movie)--we know that Betty/Diane has been called about this because of the red lampshade next to<BR>the phone at the beginning--the very red lampshade and phone we later learn are in Betty/Diane's apartment.  Betty/Diane has spent her last dime to have Rita/Camilla killed, and it didn't work.  Betty/Diane loses her marbles and kills herself (the elderly couple, I think, represent the American Viewing Audience).  Right after the opening credits we get the weird scene, from the camera's viewpoint, of someone flopping onto a red pillow and some unidentified heavy breathing.<BR>It is Betty/Diane falling (dead or else just stoned) onto her ownbed.  A friend of mine thinks, and I tend to agree, that at her moment of death, Betty/Diane's spirit goes to get the amnesiac Rita/Camilla and take her to her own dead body (which is why, in the first half of the film, Rita is the only one who screams at the sight of the body--she's really just discovered her former lover/friend dead: the realest show, the realest version of the Spanish singer falling dead away after her own taped singing: the ultimate act of being overcome).  And death is the one act you really get one chance to do right/convinciningly.  Or something.<BR>It's very annoying the DVD has no chapter selection.
B000002B35|5.0|This is a gift from the band for true Floyd lovers and those who are into psychedelic rock.  Its true that LIVE versions of this premiere band is rare and its a real bargain for us that Floyd came out with PULSE. The albums completes all the smash hits from the past and its a heaven to listen to them.  They have matured the music from decade to decade and with this maturity we have explored the new world of true psychedelic rock.  This albums features all the songs that can make an unforgettable memory.  To all the fans its just a review but get this album and feel the real floyd.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Before you mindlessly complain here that this DVD does not contain a widescreen version of the film, enlighten yourselves by reading the package for once.  Right there under Technical Specifications on the back of the package it says &quot;Original Theatrical Aspect Ratio.&quot;  That's right.  Like most of the early Disney movies, &quot;Snow White&quot; was produced in 1:33:1 full frame.  I believe the first widescreen animated film ever produced by the stuido was &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; in 1955, and even after that many were still created in fullscreen.  The recent animated features are all in widescreen, but most of the earliest were not.  So don't worry; what was seen in theaters in 1937 and in subsequent theatrical reissues of this movie just happens to fill your screen now.  This is not a reformatted &quot;pan and scan&quot; presentation, it is the film as it originally appeared.  So stop complaining, sit back, and just enjoy the magic that is &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot;
B00005JKJA|4.0|True to form, David Lynch has directed another controversial masterpiece that is will stun and shock some, absorb and mesmerize others, and infuriate and frustrate the rest.  It is a film that will elicit strong and binary reactions: few will rate this movie as \\"average\\" or simply \\"OK\\".  Like the rare novel that lurks in the fringes of your subconscious, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" will not easily go away.  And like great poetry, \\"MH\\" succeeds not in telling a story, but in leaving sufficient doubt to allow the viewer provoke and stimulate, forcing the viewer to draw their own conclusions.<br />The plot?  Suffice to say it is a story of love gone bad, of murder, deceit, and humanity at the depraved pinnacle of Hollywood sleaze.  Complicated, nonlinear, convoluted, and garish, it is definitely not your average big screen tale of good guys and bad guys with simple, happy (or even conclusive) ending.  It includes the patented Lynch surrealism that seems to bounce from dream to reality.  The acting is versatile and deep. While initially the actors seem to be playing their roles like some bizarre \\"Father Knows Best\\"-on-acid 1950's camp, by the end, it all (well, most all), begins to make sense, and the bizarre behavior falls nicely into the ultimate story line.<br />If you're looking for a simple, linear, mind numbing piece of eye-candy, don't come here.  There are plenty of one-star reviews to read that capture the frustration and absence of coherency many will feel.  But if you want to give your brain a workout in 21st century noir, and enjoy watching a film a second (or third) time to pick up the pieces missed the first time around, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is your ride.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Okay, let me say first that the goal of this film, other than providing a good story, is just to make you laugh!  No complicated jokes, no articulate quotes, no subplots, no songs that slow down the pacing, and the fewest details in the look of the characters I've witnessed in any Disney film since Snow White!  <br />I think, by seeing that there have been 170 other reviews, that I don't have to go into detail here.  Those people who gave it a 5 are correct!  One thing that never fails to crack me up again and again is Yzma's attempts at trying to kill Kuzco, all ending up as disasters, getting worse and worse!  It's as if she's breaking the fourth wall, because near the end of the film, she acts as if she knows she's under the mercy of REALLY bad screenwriters who have complete control of her fate!  \\"WHY do I even HAVE that lever?!\\"  :D<br />And Kronk will be an instant hit with kids!<br />The somewhat disappointing music video \\"Walk the Llama Llama\\" is the only bad thing I can find here- I'll bet even the kids will think it's lame.  I have not brought the Special 2-Disc Edition of this film, but it doesn't really matter.  The bonus features provided here are just enough to satisfy your quest for extra information.
B0000017CA|5.0|Through the tortured poetry of Daxx Riggs, one can only wonder what is going through this man's head when he wrote the lyrics for Acid Bath's first album: When the kite string pops. \\"It reminds me of you, the sickness of the sun, bleeding into the blue\\", taken from the first track offer only a tiny hole for one to gaze into and realize that for some, there is no sunrise. Acid Bath are a dark band, but it would be most unfare to call them death metal. They are heavy heavy yet heavy metal is not the right word when trying to describe the music. Acid Bath's music is simply put: raw human emotion.  This Louisiana based quintet conceived an album so dark, light cannot penetrate it.<br />Daxx Riggs, the singer, has an incredible range. He goes from straigh ahead death metal vocals on Dr. Seuss is dead, to soft spoken sadness on Scream of the butterfly. When listening to the songs on this album you really can't come down on which songs are good and which are bad. The heavier songs will appeal to you when you are in a certain type of mood or stain of mind, while the softer, yet just as dark ones, will appeal to you at other times.  This type of rae energy can be heard throughout the recording, you know these guys are for real.<br />The cover art is done by J.W Gacy, which is quite creepy ... The raw production only adds to the albums overall theme of darkness in today's world. This album tells the stories of people who have fallen so low, hope and faith are simply words without meaning. If you think you've been down, listen to the twisted tales of When the kite string pops, hopefully it will make you feel better about your own life and situation.
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow is back with her latest offering C'MON C'MON. The album proves to be one of her best (although I challenge anyone to find a bad album in her catalog, they are all wonderful). The album opens with the rocker &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, great start to this album. The first single &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; is the perfect summer song to sing along to. There were a few songs which just blew me out of the water, such as &quot;Safe and Sound&quot;, the acoustic and beautiful &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, and &quot;Abilene&quot; (which was intended for The Globe Sessions). The songwriting as usual is nothing short of amazing here. I do believe Sheryl is one of the more talented artists and songwriters out there. The album features a lot of guest artists, Stevie Nicks, Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines (from the Dixie Chicks), Emmylou Harris, Don Henley and more. Some other highlights include the title track which is a great summer song, &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot; and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;. Every time you listen to it, it gets better and better. Overall this is a very consistently good album, and well worth a listen.
1558908420|4.0|Sylvester Stallone starts with one of the most solid casts he has ever shared a film with as a sheriff and NYPD wanna be who has to make the choice between his cushey job as head law officer in a town populated mainly by NYPD, and what's left of his self respect.<br />A supporting cast full of A list starts and A list supporting characters deliver A list performances particularly Ray Liotta as an officer with his own past.<br />The various sub plots as executed well and the finalie is a grand one.<br />Stallone gets a lot of grief, some of it deserved for some of the campy roles he has played.  Likewise he deserves a lot of credit for the great performance in this one.<br />Well worth your money
0140177396|4.0|Book Review<br /> In the book, Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, there was plenty of action for the avid reader.  While reading the book, sometimes it was hard to follow what the character was trying to say.  Because, the book was set in the early 1900's, they talked with a myriad amount of slang and was difficult to read.  There was also some foul and offensive language.<BR> I liked the book because it was very descriptive with its actions.  When the author was describing a situation I could picture it down to the last detail.  When you can picture what you are reading it makes things more enjoyable.  Each character had their own distinct personality that stuck with them throughout the entire book.  One thing that I didn't like about the book was the ending.  After the biggest event in the book it suddenly came to an end.  I wish the author would have went a little further before bringing the book to a halt.<BR> This story is full of emotions. There are happy times and it also has its tragedies.  The book was truly enjoyable to me.  I would most certainly recommend Of Mice and Men to all mature audiences.
B000002LRX|5.0|So I pick this album up having heard Midlife crisis and Land of sunshine and realize: 'Man what have I been missing?!'. Mike Patton is without a doubt a lunatic, but an extremely unpredictable talented lunatic. Angel Dust is right on the money, not completly off the Wall like Mr. Bungle (Patton's side project) nor as commercialy appealing as The real thing (Faith no more's previous album), this record falls somewhere in the middle of both. <BR>Mike Patton's lyrics on Jizzlobber (I'm pretty sure the song is about self gratification) are insane: \\"I am what I do\\". This guy talks openly about giving head in Be Agressive (gotta love the catchy cheer leader chorus). His brutal honesty are some of the key elements which hold this album together. So many different styles, no songs sound like one another. The keyboards blend in well, heck even the back cover showing a cow's head and skinned chickens seem to fit in perfectly in some insane way. It's an album where everything, every note, every groove, every beat seems to fit in and even the insaness of the lyrics catch on after awhile.<br />My personal favorites would have to be Kindergarden, which deals with outgrowing old habits I believe.  For example when Patton sings: \\"Folklore: nobody's supposed to believe in the next grade, write it a hundred times.\\"  I usually hate when singer's rap, but Patton sounds so good I just give in.  <br />Small victory with it's oriental sounding keyboards are just great as are the crazy lyrics in everything's ruined (soon our boy became a million?).<br />This album is completly worth your time and money. It will grow on you after the first listen, not because the songs are catchy they are just written in such a way that they are very memorable, credit to the band for writting such good songs.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I originally bought this cd for the hit song Hero.  I love the entire CD.  Escape and Hero are also on the CD in Spanish , as is, Don't Turn Off the Lights.  I didn't know Spanish, but I can sing along all 3 songs in Spanish.<br />I like the mix up upbeat and love songs.........<br />It is one of my favorite CD's...
0792839129|5.0|Kids no longer get the fascination of movies like CCBB! My memory drifts back to yester ole days of my childhood when I was thrilled to see CCBB in the school Hall watching in awe the unique Car that can float n fly! The songs esp. 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang..' is a great number to sing along. Dick Van Dyke proves a marvellous inventor and Sally is cool. Ian Flemming's novel is out of an imaginative world with scripts co-written by Raold Dahl, the kids fav'. In comes the twist n turn when Dick n the kids sweep off to the forbidden kingdom and encounters the 'child catcher' like an evil bad man and its thrill to watch in awe as he's sent to prison. The movie is a sure pick for kids but the only drawback is it's a bit long. However, CCBB is a family freak to watch with enthusiasm. Enjoy!
B00000K2SC|5.0|A must see movie. Incredible is how I describe this move, the special effects are definitely dazzling and totally eye-candy. I have watched it several times and have never grown bored of it. The actors choice is very good, and the movie is awe-inspiring and a brilliant piece of work.
B000060P79|5.0|I just saw Sugar Ray in concert, and Simple Plan opened for them. They are a fun group of guys and are very talented musicians. Their new Album &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; is an incredible album!! Definitely a must buy!
B00004TRD8|5.0|The much talked about Easter egg code: &quot;82997&quot; simply doesn't work, I'm using Power DVD 3.0 to watch this movie on my PC, and every single time that I typed the code (&quot;82997&quot;) and hit the enter key the DVD starts playing the Special Edition version ONLY. Which could only mean one thing....and that is, people are exaggerating about some supposed &quot;Ultimate Extended&quot; version on this DVD. So having gotten that out of the way; I did in fact enjoy the REAL features on this DVD, but I'm also a Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, so I've enjoyed most of his films except Red Sonja which wasn't really his movie. This DVD would make an excellent addition to anyone's movie collection.
B00005T30L|2.0|Being an architect/artist I expected this movie to be different from the hollywood mainstream.  Well it was different, but it was STILL A CHICK FLICK! No I didn't expect this movie to be an action adventure, but I thought it might some nice camera angles thrown in along with some strange characters.  The characters were [silly] and I found them to be very uninteresting.  The plot was very slow paced and nothing really happens that is different than everyday normal life.  I mean, come on!  Does Hollywood think that we are such ... that we would be interested in watching a movie about an outcast's very boring life?!?<br />The reason I think this movie is a chick flick is that there is nothing appealing for the typical male.  No action, nothing visual really to look at, no sex, no adventure, no witty lines, there wasn't really any positive male role models (all the guys were complete wimps, outcasts, and mental cases).  It was almost as if this movie was male bashing throughout.<br />It's advertised as the struggles of two females after high school graduation.  Well one character is someone normal and the other is supposed to be strange and interesting.  The movie focuses on the strange character, only she's not that strange and is uninteresting for the most part. You can go to the typical high school and find more interesting characters there.  About a 1/4 way into the movie the normal character seems to disappear for the rest of the movie.  Needless to say that she was the cute one and the only one that would appeal to the typical male.   <br />The main reason I bought this movie was because Steve Buscemi was in it.  He usually plays the quirky fringe character that is amusing.  Even his role in this was disappointing. I figured if Steve B. was in it then it would have some quirky characters.  Not even. <br />So as it is I give it (2) stars and that is just because it wasn't awful every single minute.  I rate a movie (1) star if they are awful the whole way through with not one scene worthy of watching.<br />As a Chick Flick it might be a (3) star movie.  It did focus totally on human interaction and relationships, the problem is that it's just not interesting enough.  Maybe it will appeal to someone who doesn't live in a city and they will think these characters are different and interesting.      ...  <br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all.  If you are a guy and your girlfriend/wife/relative wants to watch this movie then be sure to have a book or magazine to read otherwise you will get in a fight because you will be complaining so much.
B000003TAW|5.0|this is great weezer.....a bunch of poppy punk hits all rolled into one unstoppable package...what more is there to say
0061007137|3.0|First I do think that author is very talented and I have really enjoyed of that I have read by him. This book, I enjoyed as well, though, I don't feel I can give the book a 5 as I of do judge of the authors books. I have to give this book a 3, nearly a 4. Why? Well, and I think I could be wrong, but I felt the main character was able to befriend people way to easily. In fact, way too convenient. The girl helping him, the family helping him, and a person who works for the Foreign Office using phones that may or may not secure. <br />Okay, so this is my thought. People became this mans friend too easy. They trusted him. I thought this was off. I didn't think it was feasible. Though I must admit, he was in the a different county, where that may be more feasible. I live in the US and that just may not work. So I could be wrong. However, I also think about James Bond and in those flicks, he was able to get help of others. Things just happened for him.<br />My other point, when our main character spoke on the phone with his best friend who was living the double live. He just demanded to have a question answered. There was no rationale for it.<br />Other than that, I thought the book was good. In some ways it makes me think of Honor Among Thieves, though  that book was written many years latter.<br />Well, that is a enough, I don't want to bad mouth the guy. But I do think if you are like me, pretentious about things you will find a book has some big feasibility holes.<BR>
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've decided that this is my favorite Lynch film, but it is an aquired taste nonetheless. I saw this film several times when it was in theaters and a couple more since it was released on DVD. I really don't care about the whole thing about the blurring of Laura Herring's private area (David Lynch even admitted he did that on purpose to prevent perverts from exploiting it) or the whole one chapter DVD thing. Mr. Lynch is demanding you to watch the film in its entirety. What's so bad about that? I was actually ANGRY when Lynch got Oscar nominated. Only then would an ununderstanding mainstream actually watch this film, only to gripe about they didn't \\"get it.\\" I would insist that the serious film-watcher not listen to anything those people have to say. I was also very disappointed when I heard that this wasn't going to be a television show since I had loved \\"Twin Peaks\\" so much, but Lynch is a cinema person. Network television just doesn't deserve his talents. I still hoped he would release the pilot in some fashion. Then I heard he won Best Director at Cannes. I wondered what the lovely was going on. As it turned out, the project turned out to be a surrealist gem! I think most of it makes sense. I've tried explaining what I think the \\"meaning\\" is, but not many people will listen b/c I guess more people want to pay attention to b.s. like \\"Zoolander\\" or \\"Panic Room.\\" I've heard every theory from the film is just a ... meditation on how modern Hollywood is the destruction of Zen to the whole thing is actually taking place in the 1950's and is the realization of the film that the director is casting. Whatever the \\"real\\" meaning, I think the whole thing is perfect! The music and cinematography is GORGEOUS and deserves EVERY AWARD in the the book! It is definitely Lynch's sexiest with beautiful locations, occasional Spanish language and lovely female physiques on display everywhere. It certainly surpasses the boredom that \\"Lost Highway,\\" \\"Eraserhead,\\" and \\"Dune\\" conveyed and the love theme is stronger than the ones in \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Wild At Heart.\\" I'm not quite sure if this is better than \\"Elephant Man,\\" and \\"Straight Story,\\" but they don't count since those were TRUE stories. \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" seems to be total surrealism with realistic moral messages involving obsession, unrealistic dreams and mortality. There is a lingering grim sadness floating throughout the narrative, particularly in the second part (probably b/c of how ABC treated Lynch after he delivered the pilot). I'm really not quite sure what to make of that stupid blue key or whatever it is supposed to \\"open up,\\" and the ending IS just a tad too hokey with the loss-of-innocence and embracing-of-the-abyss metaphors for my tastes. But what the film did for me was open up the possibilities of cinema (independent or mainstream) and suggested that imagination does actually exist and is necessary for survival even in this day and age. Naomi and Laura were really great too, especially in bed (tee hee)! You go Lynch!
B000002J1U|5.0|Sure, only part of this album qualifies as heavy metal.  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; brings Icelandic thunder to stoners around the world, though the triumph belongs mostly to the rhythm section  ( the guitar sounds like it's coming out of a telephone ).  &quot;Celebration Day&quot; swaggers around with absolute mastery while &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; remains the prototype for all the NWOBHM bands that appeared ten years later.  Oh, yeah, &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; does have that tightly coiled fuzz guitar at the end. <br />However, the claustrophobic orchestra on &quot;Friends&quot; forecasts the Arabic snarl that would power &quot;Kashmir&quot;, and &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is hot and leadfooted enough to tick the needles on the Heavy-O-Meter©.  That's three-fifths of the record, and the beauty of the rest just throws the heaviness into sharper relief.
B000063K5W|5.0|Yes, it's nothing at all like the Rocky Horror picture show. I watched this right after Velvet Goldmine & they were different yet so complimentive! If you like androgynie, are a yaoi or shounenai fan, miss the 80s, like Jrock, or loved Velvet Goldmine your going to love this movie^.^

B000005RFL|5.0|It takes a while to grow on you, but this is really the best Sabbath studio LP of all.  Though there is no such thing as a perfect Sabbath album, this album has a spot of genius in every song: the choruses of \\"Looking For Today\\" (you buried the lead, guys) and \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\", the brief descending guitar breaks in \\"Spiral Architect\\". And the grooves are the deepest Ozzy & Co. ever cooked up.  The title track is just death itself; some enterprising rapper oughta hook up with \\"A National Acrobat\\" tout suite; and despite the cliché-squared lyrics, \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" cooks harder than the Meters, even.  The instrumental is pretty and dealable, and \\"Who Are You\\"'s melody ultimately overcomes the lack of Iommi-skronk.  Overall, one killer record.<br />Incidentally, the remastered version is worth purchasing - brighter, and with much more bottom end.
9997512332|5.0|I'm reading all the Bond books in order and I'm on Thunderball now but Doctor No is the best so far. The characters are great with Quarrel and Honey Rider. M thinks hes giving Bond a break with an easy case but its probably the toughest adventure ever for Bond. The book is unputdownable from the very start when Bond's friend Strangways is kidnapped. When Bond is on &quot;Crab Key&quot; the book is great with all the obstacles Bond has to go through. The dragon, Dr. No's obstacle course and the animal at the end of it and the final showdown with Doctor No and the way he dies is pretty funny. Great book my favorite so far.
B000001TVD|5.0|If Zeppelin IV was on the \\"heads\\" side of a coin, this LP would be \\"tails.\\"  Some similiarities: Both albums came out in 1971, the year that the utopian dream of the Sixties really ran out of steam for good.  Both albums open with a momentary snatch of sound before the singer addresses you a cappella.  Both end with a vision of personal and societal disaster.  And both sound like they were recorded under the influence of about 3000 hits of sunshine blotter.  <br />But Maggot Brain is a much darker affair than Zep IV ( pun not intended, but not entirely inappropriate either).  The British lemon squeezers leaven their mix with sunshowers like \\"Going to California\\", and even the heaviest rockers are mostly about getting your dolphin waxed and bustling in hedgerows with hobbits.  Even the cops in \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" are friendly.  The universe of Maggot Brain is infinitely more malign; Rodney King would recognize the cops here.  <br />An echoing chatter like a speedfreak's teeth races between your speakers, then George Clinton offers the album's Inspirational Quote, an affirmation of personal responsibility in the face of Earth's demise.   Eddie Hazel spends the next ten minutes grieving for Mutha Earth through a wall of Marshall amps.  The burning guitar spew of \\"Maggot Brain\\" is infinitely more crude in execution than anything Hendrix ever recorded (even on the brown acid ),  but somehow manages to convey a range of human emotion so vast that it stands as one of the GREAT GUITAR MOMENTS IN HUMAN HISTORY, right up there with Sonny Sharrock's \\"My Song\\" and Zappa's \\"Watermelon in Easter Hay\\" in terms of transcending ... to split the very atom.  <br />\\"Can You Get To That\\" lightens things up somewhat; the gospel choir makes you pass the collection plate, but the sermon's pretty heavy, even though you heard it already at the end of Abbey Road.  Then, three increasingly dense blasts of snarky wah/metal, culminating in \\"Super Stupid\\"'s cautionary tale of drug deals gone sour.  Tony Iommi, meet Ziggy Modeliste.  <BR>\\"Back in Our Minds\\" provides brief respite from the storm, an opportunity to rest before the next peak of lysergic activity.  Uh-oh, here it comes, and it's a doozy: \\"Wars of Armageddon\\" is a nine-minute Santana-esque jam of crude force and acceleration, culminating in nuclear annihilation, the heartbeat of the Star Child from 2001...and then some more jamming.  It's conceptually similar to the piano chord that ends \\"A Day In The Life\\", but much much longer.<br />A particular Buddhist tenet says that the lotus flower grows in deep mud; the deeper the mud, the more beautiful the flower.  Maggot Brain rises from the cynicism and despair of urban America in the Nixon era and the bloom is still as amazing now as it was 23 years ago.
B00004BZ16|4.0|I purchased Sandinista! in 1999 at the age of 14; since then I've listened to it enough to get an adequate impression. In all honesty, it was sort of a disservice to the Clash's fans (at least in my opinion). Had this been released as a single or double album, it would have dropped some of the weaker tracks (Rebel Waltz, Let's Go Crazy, Kingston Advice, etc.) and provided for more focus on the wealth of EXCELLENT material present. In it's uncut form this album becomes incredibly tedious. I think that a good deal of the songs would have been better suited on a collection such as \\"the Clash on Broadway,\\" or some other all-encompassing set.<br />However, the bright spots on this album are phenomenal. \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" is a dead-on version of the early hip-hop scene of 1980 NYC. In having watched \\"Westway to the World\\" I can see how much of an impact hip-hop was having, even so early on. \\"Lightning Strikes\\" is a kind of oddly American freak-funk, while \\"The Call Up\\" and \\"Washington Bullets\\" mix politics with reggae and latin influences, respectively. My favorites would have to be \\"Somebody Got Murdered,\\" a song distinctly English and yet cathartic enough to have come from any urban center, and \\"Police on my Back,\\" an Eddy Grant cover (Electric Avenue) that substitutes guitars for sirens.<br />According to interviews with the Clash (once again, I recommend \\"Westway to the World\\" to anyone interested in the Clash's story), this album was laid down in three weeks. Granted, it could have been clipped and packaged into a more coherent collection, but even in its lengthy state it's still an important milestone for the band. <br />While I can enjoy it and appreciate it, it's still no \\"London Calling.\\"

B000059XVS|4.0|Excellent casting in this tale of war in the middle east during world war 1. Delves into the arab psyche as well as delivering the tale of a man who dared to differ from his own race and class,  and find a temporary home among the arabs. Strangely prophetic in ways, as the arabs seek a homeland amidst british duplicity. A great movie for a dark cold night.
B0000636UN|4.0|After nine years, three studio albums, and countless soundtrack and tribute album contributions, Sheryl Crow's body of work has been so consistent that faithful followers know just what to expect of her: solid songwriting that glimpses the 60's and 70's without sounding retro, production that sounds rough around the edges but not unpolished, and straightforward vocals sung with exceptional pitch (and then layered).  For the most part, Sheryl's fourth studio project, &quot;C'mon, C'mon,&quot; gives them exactly those elements.  What's different this time around is a considerable mellowing, a rounding of those aforementioned rough edges.  In one lyric she sings, &quot;I'm gonna tell everyone to lighten up,&quot; and apparently she started with herself.<br />Mind you, the set gets off to a running start with one of her strongest and most catchy rockers to date, &quot;Steve McQueen.&quot;  &quot;Like Steve McQueen, all I need's a fast machine,&quot; Crow belts over a funky, sample-enchanced rhythm and chicka-chicka guitars.  The momentum continues with the album's first single, the irresistible &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; one of those California rock songs tailor made for convertibles and the beach.  Low in beats-per-minute but still worthy of head-bobs is &quot;You're an Original,&quot; a solid jam that sounds so much like classic rock that it makes perfect sense to have Lenny Kravitz crooning in the background.<br />But surprisingly, ballads make up most of the album, and some are more successful than others.  Stevie Nicks lends her chops to a pair of winners, the SoCal country rocker of a title track and the lovely &quot;Diamond Road,&quot; which boasts a charming, Beatlesque time change in the chorus.  The touching &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; originally performed on the telethon for September 11 victims in a much milder arrangement, is cranked up considerably here; the haunting piano used in the telethon version is unfortunately toned way down, but it's a gorgeouscomposition either way, and Crow infuses the final section with such fire it's a small miracle she has any vocal cords left.  The self-help ballad &quot;Abilene&quot; and &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; a duet with Don Henley written by Sheryl and her sister Kathryn, are both agreeable without being spectacular, but two tracks probably could have been left out altogether: &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; originally written and produced by Crow for Stevie Nicks' &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; album, is a solid composition, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow makes an interesting choice for a backup vocalist.  But it suffers the same fate as another ballad, &quot;Over You&quot;: the tempo, rhythms, and arrangements are so similar to other songs on the album that these two, lacking killer hooks, simply get lost in the shuffle.<br />Then there are moments, as on the bouncy &quot;Hole in My Pocket&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Over You,&quot; where the new lightness in Crow's touch is almost too much of a jolt.  Both tracks could easily have been done by Amy Grant - while that's certainly no insult (one listen to Amy's &quot;Behind the Eyes&quot; album will prove the gap between Grant and Crow isn't as wide as you'd expect), the end results are still a good deal fluffier than we've come to expect from Sheryl, and you almost find yourself longing for the girl who used to like a good beer buzz early in the morning.  But her previous incarnations are not fully lost, even though they too are tweaked with: the striking &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; harks back to the wild child stylings of her self-titled sophomore release, but the gritty production doesn't hinder the solid pop songwriting at hand...the end result sounds like something Carly Simon might have come up with after a hit of acid.  Then on the stunner of a finale, &quot;Weather Channel,&quot; Crow adopts the pensive persona that made up much of the moody and often-dark &quot;Globe Sessions&quot; album, but this time instead of merelygiving us a page from her diary, she goes all out and bravely exposes the nerve.  Crow's bouts with depression have always been hinted at, but lines like &quot;I've got friends/they're waiting for me to comb out my hair and join the human race/but I don't feel too human&quot; are downright vulnerable.  Luckily anxiety doesn't make her lose her sense of humor; anti-depression medication is given the clever metaphor &quot;I know it may not fix the hinges/but at least the door has stopped its creaking.&quot;  Backed only by guitar, strings, and Emmylou Harris' backing vocals, this is Crow's most effective and touching ballad to date.<br />Yes, finding more pop than rock on a Sheryl Crow record is a bit of a surprise, as is the cleaner production.  And those soundalike ballads are problems (which ones are expendable are in the eye of the beholder).  And while it doesn't match her sophomore effort's realm of inspired masterpiece, &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is still an immensely enjoyable aspect of one of our most gifted singer-songwriters.  The surprise isn't the quality of material, but the fact that we wouldn't have expected Sheryl Crow to give us such a mellow, polished, summer record.  Expectations be damned; we still ought to be grateful.
B000002GK1|5.0|To put it quite simply this is the biggest album I have ever heard. I grant it was a slow decline after this album for the band<br />This album has some of the most ripping and evil guitar licks ever heard, the riff to rusty cage is nuts.<br />cornells voice is amazing on this album, I am sure he could have been an opera singer in a former life with a range like his. His voice is amazing in the way that he can scream to the point of distorting the microphone through an entire octave slide, without his voice breaking up at all. I dream of having a voice like his.<br />The lyrics on this album are very well written is Cornell's usual form. I personaly think that his best lyrics to date were on \\"Temple of the dog\\".<br />So this is an album is about as close to perfect as say \\"OK Computer\\" was to the late 90's, there is absolutely no filler on this album, they are back to back gems. If you only buy one album of their's this is it, it is big, it is loud and it pulls no punches.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Granted, every song sounds like a variation of the one before it...<br />Granted, there is absolutely no musical or lyrical sophistication to be heard anywhere on it...<br />BUT...<br /><br />This disc is guitar-heavy, raucous, and a heck of a lot of fun to play LOUD!!  Great disc to play in your car as you are driving with the top down!  The songs are kind of simplistic, but there are some interesting bass lines running through them.  And just because the songs are short and simple doesn't mean they aren't great to listen to, especially if you have cranky neighbors you want to irritate.<br />  And I haven't heard this much piano on a rock record since Meat Loaf.<br />This CD sells for almost half what most new CDs sell for, and it is worth every penny!<br />Very unsophisticated, but still fun to listen to if you like your party anthems LOUD!  Way to go, Andrew W.K.!
B000002GJH|5.0|Every once in a while there is an album that you stumble accross and then you spend the next 10 years trying work out why everyone doesn't have a copy.<br />Basicaly it is half the members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam together. I was dubious at the time when I heard about it, but the story goes that they got together to write one tribute song and it turned into a whole album.<br />The songs are incredibly well written, but the thing that stands out is Cornell's lyrics, &quot;Wooden Jesus&quot; has some of the most poignent lyrics I have ever heard. <br />The album is not anywhere near as heavy as say &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; it is fairly light in that respect but it is a must own album from the grunge era.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time over a month ago and I still can't get over how amazing it is.  It's, in my opinion, the best movie of the year, decade, and maybe more.  Right now, I'm having trouble finding words to express how this movie has changed my life.  Though I have never known anybody who is or was a drug addict, I imagine this could be an exact replica of what some of them went through.  And if not, the director did such a good job convincing the viewers that it was.  And where do I start with Ellen Burstyn, a woman who has won an Oscar for Best Actress already a long time ago (for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore).  I'm still convinced that Julia Roberts only won last year for Erin Brockovich over Burstyn just because people felt that Roberts deserved one just because she's Julia Roberts, and not because of her role.  Burstyn's role in this movie forced her to go through hell every day on the set to look like hell (bad or no make-up at all, fat suits, bad wigs) and had to portray true fear in scenes like when the fridge comes to life in a hallucination and gobbles her up, or when she is in the hospital getting ESP because she became addicted to diet pills under no fault of her own and eventually became crazy.  And by that scene at the end and the last couple scenes after that, I know that I felt a little pity towards her.  After going on enough about Burstyn, there's also the stellar supporting cast including Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and the lovely Jennifer Connelly.  Connelly deserved the Oscar for this movie rather than A Beautiful Mind.  She got down and dirtier more than Burstyn when, in order to get drug money, she prostituted herself and did anything and everything to get what she wanted.  That also was hard to watch, especially with the scene at the end (I won't go into details since I don't want to ruin it for others and because I probably can't say what she did).  I, along with the rest of the viewers, was surprised and impressed by MarlonWayans acting.  Sure is a heck of a better actor than Damon Wayans.  And Jared Leto played Burstyn's son, an addict who doesn't want his mother to get addicted since he loves her very much.  I really felt the chemistry between Burstyn and Leto and it worked well together.  Anyway, this is definitely the best drug movie ever made, it's accurate, depressing, and exhilirating to watch.  But it's not for the weak.  It's in-your-face, especially if you see the unedited version.  But you will be amazed.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This just simply a great album to sing along to, it is quiet with just vocals and a backing guitar type of feel. It's great late night study music when you need a pick me up but without being loud. There are very few band that I can bare listening to when I have been awake for 3 days straight through fear of my head splitting open at the hint of a power chord. But this is a band who are great listening to anytime, some of there lyrical undertones are fantastic and you wouldn't expect to find such dark ideas in such bright songs.<br />I have bought all of their albums to date and they are all fantastic but this one and the boy with the arab strap are probably my favorite.<br />If you like &quot;The Violent Femmes&quot; &quot;Cracker&quot; &quot;Donovan&quot; this should appeal to you.
B00005R2BG|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a treat for Bohemians everywhere. Everything was so artistic: the music, the costumes, the set design. There was even quite a bit of comedy. <BR>&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the story of a young writer named Christian who goes to France to seek his fortune. One day, he stumbles upon a group of Bohemians who believe in &quot;Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and, above all things Love&quot;. They take him to the Moulin Rouge (French for &quot;Red Windmill&quot;) where he meets Satine, the star of the show. He falls in love with her instantly. But, unfortunately, so does &quot;The Duke&quot;. Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge, signs a contract binding Satine to the Duke only. Thus begins a very beautiful and tragic love story. The only bad part is that you have to stomach the really stupid first fifteen minutes to experience this colorful and entrancing film. Bohemians like me will love this movie instantly.
B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed is one of the godfathers of modern music without doubt, but he had a very hit and miss solo career after The Velvet Underground, he reminds me of Lennon McCartney in the way that they were just average without each other. The Velvet Underground were incredible together, but appart they were at best, good and usualy average. Lou Reed has produced some rubbish in his solo career but occasionaly \\"New York\\" \\"blue mask\\" \\"transformer\\" he gets the nail on the head and produces something great.<br />New York has some ripping tracks on it, some of them have the same urgency and encompasing get up and go that the VU years had like \\"busload of faith\\".<br />Straw Man is a huge track with so much pent up agression, Dirty Boulavard is in my oppinion one of the best social commentary tracks around.<br />If you loved The Velvet Underground you will like this, if you love this you must must must buy the Velvet Underground albums.
0345448898|4.0|I have read a great deal of bad, and extremely bad sci-fi, and fantasy books. I'm unsure why it is that those two genras of fiction are so often bent on pornography and unreasonable amounts of blood-shed. What I like about this trilogy, having just finished the last book a couple nights back, is the stark lack of either of these characteristics that generally typtify the scope of sci-fi/fantasy. It echos the emotions and ideas/interests of other great(er) stories --The Little Prince or the Narnia Series for philosophy and theology, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for description of worlds, like our own, yet so terribly beautiful and different, and The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings for the increadibly important and epic battle between good (right) and evil (wrong). <br />The hero and heroine are sympathetic characters, they are 'human' (neither perfectly good nor increadibly bad). They are forced by circumstance (a.k.a. the author's slightly heavy-handed manipulation of his characters) to make adult choices and through that process grow up themselves, feel love, and change the world(s) around them. <br />In short (though it's already too late for that), it's good, honest writing, that deserves more than one reading by anyone old enough (or young enough in spirit) to be considered a \\"young adult.\\"
B00004Z4SD|5.0|First, let me disclose my bias that I am a HUGE David Lynch fan.  That being said, let me also say that in no way does that sway my opinion of this movie.  Yeah, right.  No, seriously, it doesn't.  Why?  Well...<br />To begin, this is the most un-Lynchian movie D.L. has ever created.  I say that with somewhat of a \\"grain of salt,\\" but I think most stalwart Lynch fans will understand my meaning.  This is simply unlike ANYTHING he has ever done.  Period.  There is definitely a linear, less-is-more, mentality in this film.  It is immediately touching and kindles the very most basic humane spirit that (I would like to believe) dwells within us all.<br />Perhaps the subject matter is the major reason why that is the case.  But simply put, this movie is wholly and completely beautiful.  Every facet of the movie just drips with beauty.  Whether it's the gorgeous sunrises or sunsets over the plains, or whether it's simply LISTENING to Richard Farnsworth (aka \\"Alvin Straight\\") talk as the viewer stares into a campfire...watching the flames dance around the logs thrown on top of each other.  Whether its seeing the huge amount of road that lay before Alvin Straight, or whether its listening to him haggle over prices of tractor repairs or a \\"grabber.\\"  Every where the viewer is taken, is beautiful.<br />What else? My God, Harry Dean Stanton.  Can I just digress for a moment and ask:  \\"WHEN IS PARIS, TEXAS GOING TO BE RELEASED ON DVD?\\"  The agony of going with out it (save for an extremely well-worn VHS copy) is torture.  At any rate, enough of that.  My point is this, Harry Dean Stanton (in the words of David Lynch) \\"rocks.\\"  He is an amazing actor. Pure brilliance.  Even his (roughly) two minute appearance in this movie makes it that much more complete.  As an aside once more, Harry Dean Stanton always reminds me of (the old, not young) Chet Baker (of trumpet-playing fame).  Anyone else?<br />Which brings me to my next amazing person:  Sissy Spacek.  As always, she delivers and impeccable performance as the mildly-brain damaged daughter of Alvin Straight.  Once again Ms. Spacek, kudos.<br />Of course, the man of the show is the late Richard Farnsworth.  Many may remember him as the sheriff in Stephen King's \\"Misery.\\"  His performance here is just heart-stopping. He was an amazing man, who was perfectly suited for the role of Alivn Straight.<br />Musically, as with any Lynch film, it is beautiful.  Angleo (\\"The Bad Angel\\") is here again, delivering a more restrained, yet equally capturing, score.  There are very brief moments, that, just for a moment, you can hear remnants of Twin Peaks' material showing their presence (particularly in the very beginning of the film).<br />There are so many images that come to mind during the course of watching this film.  You are drawn to a variety of mediums from Lynch's imagery.  For instance, the descriptions of the plains that Willa Cather used in her book \\"My Antonia\\" came to my mind.  Then, for some reason, Steve Earle's song \\"The Road Goes On Forever\\" came to mind.  The ability of a director to instill (or rather, recall) memories within the viewer's mind is something that is not achieved frequently.  Here, Lynch does it perfectly.<br />Lastly, despite the fact that this is a G rated movie, and despite the fact that Disney is behind it, it is not a children's movie.  That is, it is not for kids.  Older kids will appreciate the message this movie delivers.  However, younger kids who just finished watching Barney or Rugrats will probably not even understand what is going on within the film.<br />To make a long (winded) review longer, get this film as soon as you can.  The DVD (technically speaking) is beautiful and I applaud Lynch for not inserting chapter breaks.  But more importantly, the film itself is beautiful and moving and will touch you permanently.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I believe that andrew w.k  is the new rock god cause all the rock [stinks] now it was good back in 96 and 97 then it just started getting bad then i went to rap after that then i realized rap is worse and went to classic rock bands such as acdc metallica bob dylan beatles byrds pink floyd and so on then i started listing to the a radio station i normally dont get it and i started getting into newer rock sorta and then my buddie at school is like man andrew wk is so hardcore man so i thought why not download his cd  to see if its any good and to my surprise a new rocker that sounded good  so i went out and bought his cd i feel andrew is gonnna change the sound of rock and i hope he does cause new rock is the worst ever now expect for the odd band that has soemthing to say other than love and hopefully backstreet boys will no longer exsit

I was a bit worried about spending cash on it at first  but when a mate told me that it was a great peice of fotage,They certanly were not lying and I will never regret buying it. The best thing about it is how it proves to the world that Jimmy Page is the greatest guitarist that ever lived and theres some cool acted out pieces fitted into the songs also. from one zep fan to another, you and a group of mates get this DVD sit in a nice room with a wide screen TV, some goodies and sit in awe as the greatest band ever blow your mind out.

0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is the story of the events in Somalia on October 3rd, 1993. <BR>The books details a raid that the stationed U.S. Army Rangers staged against Mohamed Farah Aidid, a warlord who declared himself president of Somalia, and was hampering U.N. efforts to feed the starving country. <BR>During the midafternoon, about 180 elite Amry Rangers and Delta Force troops dropped into Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, where they were to capture two lieutenants of the warlord. <BR>Right as the mission began, things went wrong. One Ranger fell eighty feet from the Black Hawk that he was in to the ground. The Somalis, who were excited due to the raid, and due to the drugs that are common among the population began to attack the soldiers who also opened fire. Before too long, a fierce fire-fight began. After the prisoners were loaded onto the convoy of humvees and flatbeds, the convoy began to move out. <BR>Then disaster struck. Using RPGs, (Rocket Propelled Granades) a Somali managed to hit on of the Black Hawk helicopters that was flying over head, causing it to crash to the ground, killing the crew. The soldier's mission changed from a raid to a rescue mission, and they had to fight their way to the crash site. The convoy was turned around, and proceeded to the crash site, but the trucks got lost, resulting in the deaths of a couple soldiers riding back. <BR>Soon, another helicopter was also hit, and crashed, killing several of the crew, and this time, there was no rescue for the survivors. <BR>By the end of the mission, which was supposed to last for an hour, but dragged on into the night, 18 soldiers, of the Rangers and Delta Force were killed, and 73 were seriously wounded. Three more Black Hawks were shot up and forced down, but they returned to the base where they were stationed. <br />This story is among the most horrifying and realistic that I have read. Bowden pulled this story off spectacularly, and I felt that I was in the action while reading it. It flows quickly, making the book about a 1-3 day read. The book divides cleanly into thirds. Right off the bat, he drags us in with the troops going into battle, then backs up and described the base life, and the mission backrounds. Then he moves onto the attack, and then onto the aftermath and rescue of the only surviving pilot, Mike Durant. <BR>Bowden's description of the battle is as realistic as can be. As the soldiers landed, he describes their reactions and thoughts, and accuratly shows the tensions between the Delta Force and Rangers. As the fight escalated, he also describes the Ranger's need to get to the crash sites, with problems between them and the air and the Somalis fighting them. <BR>This is a true war classic.
B00005A46T|1.0|It's amazing how terrible music can be. Now I didn't listen to IOWA, but I heard the first piece of [junk], then decided to look at reviews for this album to see if people's musical tastes had matured at all, but I see that the IQ's remain in the 2-digit region. Now...<BR>In order for music to be heavy, it can NOT have a paper thin feel. If these guys had 6 double-bass drummers, 10 electric guitars playing power chords, and the bass turned up all the way, they would still have a paper-thin feel. THEY WILL NEVER BE HEAVY. EVER. I can't say these guys have horrible lyrics.......THEY DON'T HAVE LYRICS! Just a bunch of mindless, meaningless, morbid, mentally-deficient attempts at being \\"sic\\". The fake anger and alienation has somehow convinced all these little nu-metal [guys] that they really do have a bad life when they really have nothing to complain about (so they decide to live AS IF their lives are so horrible, and in the process, they make life [stink] for themselves). Here's a tip Corey: You're not \\"sick\\" or \\"insane\\" because you SAY you are. In fact, if you even have a mind to judge anything AS \\"sane\\" or \\"insane\\", you already have too much rational thought to be insane (thus disproving your gimmicky rants which you try to pass off as lyrics).  Insane people don't wear masks because they are being THEMSELVES, not playing a character. \\"THIS IS A WAR!\\" A war against what? Corey doesn't know, and neither do the \\"maggots\\" who are most probably gonna come in and make up an actual motivation for this so-called \\"war\\". \\"[Forget] everything you stand for!\\" Another tip Corey-Punk is dead, and when it was alive, it's motivations were nothing like your juvenile tantrums. <BR>TIP #3: Give Slayer, GWAR, and KoRn their styles back. <BR>The drummer is fast, but lacks style.<br />You want heaviness done right- bands like Cannibal Corpse, Slayer, Deicide, Sepultura, and Morbid Angel have already been mentioned. <BR>You want REAL creative, EFFECTIVE mixing of styles and blending ofsounds (with the added bonus of ACTUAL musicianship and REAL heaviness)? Listen to Candiria.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I got this tattoo from my friend, Sammy Jankis.  He tattooed it on my left arm.  It says memento.  It helps me remember.  I get distracted.  I have this memory loss problem and I cant remember things that just happened.  ....I have this tattoo.  It says memento.  It helps me remember.  Memento is a great movie that I saw after someone killed something I loved.  That took away my memory......Memento is a great movie I saw.  I saw it with my friend Teddy.  But I don't trust Teddy.  and I can't really remember what I was telling you.....But I have this friend, Sammy Jankis......................Ok, you get the picture, and again this is one of my classic reviews which is probably more the for people who have seen Memento than the people who haven't.  I had many friends who saw it and had different opinions about what happens at the end.  This left me a little unsure of whether I wanted two hours of rare free time watching something ambiguos.  Did I need more untied threads in my life?  The answer is yes.  This is a miraculous film.  Of course in the context of what I like to watch these days, this stands tall.  It is unique.  It is clever.  It is structurally complex.  It is challenging.  If you don't want to be challenged., I can recommend alot of Elvis Movies you can check out.  But this is a great film.  One that lets you do some of the discovery.  You stand with the protagonist and need to make the same discoveries he does.  But don't be put off by the concept that you may not figure it out.  This is a roller coaster ride and one that you wont forget.  Unless you're me.  But my friend Sammy Jankis tattoed the name of the movie on my arm.  It's called Memento
B00004Z4SD|5.0|you might as well be dead. This is a beautiful movie. I'll admit that it is really American, though. One of the most American movies ever made. If you want to try to understand our people, you can start here. I will guarantee that it's less stressful than trying to understand Arabs.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is that kind of book that you just can't put down. I even cried at times. At the same time I wanted to know all that happened, but I didn't want the book to finish. It not only tells the well-known story from the women's point of view but also from the pagan's point of view. The religious discussions can be a little repetitive sometimes, but never tedious nor boring. <BR>One thing that I found very interesting was that even though Morgaine is the narrator in most chapters, Igraine,  Viviane and Gwenevere also narrate the story in some chapters, exposing their views and helping you understand the complexity of things. The characters aren't \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\", they're human. <BR>So, even if you don't care about the Arthurian Legens (this was my first and only book on the subject), this is a book I strongly recommend.
0195145925|1.0|I have a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, have been a student of Philosophy, and am currently working in computer programming field.  I was deeply disappointed in this book since the author, in my opinion, has failed to relate his a-Temporal vision of the Universe with our common experience.  To wit: he has failed to provide a methodology for recovering the temporal every day experince from an a-temporal Universe. Life & consciousness are never explained (even plausibly) within his ideas.  He has failed, in my opinion, on two fronts:  the construction of a metaphysical system that would explain the Universe in richer terms than the current (admittedly simplisitic and at times confused) metaphyiscs of contemporary mainstram Physics.  The author, philosophically speaking, has not given us any thing beside the dead-end & poverty-stricken Monadology of Leibniz.  Moreover, he has also failed in demonstrating how the current temporal physics can be tranformed into an a-temporal physics and the gain from such a radical change in outlook.  Perhaps such a change in view would help the theory of quantum gravity but I seriously doubt that it will be useful in rheology, stellar structures, quantum electronics etc.  Overall, an ambitious claims with no results.  One would be better off reading \\"Combinatorial Physics\\" or \\"Information Mechanics\\".  Lastly, I find the cosmogonic ideas of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Budhism infinitely superior to the author's musings on the relationship between Platonia and our human existence, indeed of Man's purpose & place in existence.  He has not explaied either Birth or Death.
068815333X|3.0|Dennis Lehane's \\"Prayers for Rain\\" is in many ways a work of fantasy. It's like a good Chuck Norris action film, Clint Eastwood western, or James Bond flick, light on motivation and complexity but strong on style, street smarts, machismo, and the thrills of violence. You don't watch \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" to see the Man with No Name discover inner peace and turn in his guns. You don't want Charles Bronson to forgive the sociopaths who raped his wife and daughter and grow all sensitive and needy.  No, you watch these screen characters -- the way you read about Lehane's Patrick Kenzie, Angie Gennarro, and Bubba Rogowski -- because an adolescent, nihilistic chamber of your mind responds to them.  Improbable action and dialog? OK, some. Holes here and there in the plot? Maybe a few. Pop psychology masquerading as dark insight? Perhaps. Just keep in mind that, from a literary standpoint, this book is hamburger, not filet mignon. It's beef stew, not beef Stroganoff. But if you can enjoy it for what it is -- a hip thriller, an entertaining read, a testosterone high -- then you'll have as much fun with it as I did.
B00005JKYI|5.0|This is that movie you just have to watch to remind yourself that freedom is alive in the world.<br />Kevin Bacon plays the part of Ren, and he does a goooood job at it.  Ren is a liberal, upbeat, pop-infested teen from Chicago who moves out to the bible belt with a step-family.  In the town, dancing is illegal due to influence from the Religious Right.  But Kev--I mean Ren, is determined to win the youth back their freedom.  He teaches them what the wonder of dancing is all about.<br />This is the movie for those of you who can't find a place to dance, especially in the modern America where all nightlife is closed off to teenagers and young adults.  It will make you reminisce of a more permissive time when teenagers were treated with freedom and expected to pay back with responsibility.  It also shows the pickle a community can get in when it passes too many laws \\"for your own good.\\"  We are more and more living in a society where the youth are losing their civil liberties, and I truly believe repression is at least partly to blame for all the acts of violence and angst in today's teen populace.  <br />Watch this movie and I hope you will be convinced of the need to keep teens free from too many lifestyle restrictions.  Besides, Kevin looks really good in this film, just like many of the Eighties teenage boys did.... :)
6302752337|4.0|There really isn't any big mystery as to why EASY RIDER was such a massive hit when it was released in 1969.  On a budget of no more than half a million dollars, the director/producer team of Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda somehow captured the alienation that a lot of young people felt about America during that turbulent time.<br />Hopper and Fonda are, respectively, Billy and Wyatt, two Harley Davidson-riding hippie bikers who, after making a big drug score with a big-time dope dealer (played by record mogul Phil Spector), embark on a journey across America, ostensibly to enjoy a good time in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  Along the way, they encounter, initially, the more idealistic side of America in a New Mexico hippie commune and a farm in Arizona.  But when they get into Texas, their joining a parade illegally gets them tossed into a redneck jail.  Not long after, though, they are bailed out by a very inebriated lawyer by the name of George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a household word in Hollywood).<br />Nicholson cheerfully agrees to go along with them on their Harley sojourn.  Along the way, Hopper complains to him about how he and Fonda are constantly harrassed by the law and unable to get even a \\"second rate motel\\" to sleep in.  Nicholson gingerly explains to the pair that it's not just the length of the hair that bothers people; it's what they represent--individual freedom: \\"They'll talk to you and talk to you about freedom, but when they see someone with real freedom, it's gonna scare them.\\"  One night, Louisiana rednecks savagely beat and kill Nicholson.  It is at this point that EASY RIDER starts getting bleaker in tone.<br />Fonda and Hopper arrive in New Orleans at the height of Mardi Gras, and cavort around an Orleans cemetary with two hookers (Toni Basil, Karen Black) during an acid trip.  But dismayed by what they've seen, they beat a hasty retreat and continue east.  Fonda realizes the futility of their journey now.  He tells Hopper, \\"We blew it.\\"  Their journey comes to an end on a Florida highway when Hopper flicks off two rednecks in a truck, who then proceed to blow both him and Fonda off the road.<br />Unquestionably dated to a large extent, particularly in the strange editing of certain sequences and the acid trip, which looks less avant garde and more amateurish, EASY RIDER nevertheless has its merits.  The soundtrack is one of those merits, with 1960s classics like Steppenwolf's \\"Born To Be Wild\\" and the Band's \\"The Weight\\", and countryish tracks like \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\" (the Byrds) and \\"Don't Bogart Me\\" (Fraternity of Man).  The other is, of course, Nicholson's star-making performance as George Hanson.  Before this, Nicholson was just a B-grade actor.  But his often-uproarious and, later, thoughtful performance here cemented his reputation as a top-notch movie star forever.<br />Featuring very fine cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs, who later went on to do portions of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, EASY RIDER is a flawed film by today's standards, but in its day was a groundbreaking film that helped change Hollywood forever.  If one can get by its being highly dated, it still works as a period piece.

B00004U8H4|4.0|If American Psycho took itself seriously as a social commentary on the morally bankrupt capitalist culture of the late 80s, it would [disappoint]. Billions of movies have done that theme to death, often with better results (notably Wall Street). Where American Psycho succeeds is in its ability to recognize that it is, ultimately, a cult/camp film. I think you realize this most during the classic \\"business card\\" scene in which Patrick Bateman and his carbon copy clones exchange new cards which all looked pretty much the same to me. Not so for Patrick, who feels dizzy (a whoosh is heard on the soundtrack - glee!) everytime somebody pulls out a more delicate sans serif font or a higher quality textured vellum card. And I mean, there's a scene where Christian Bale is running naked with a chainsaw and blood around his mouth. Obviously serious satire is not intended. Bale knows this and camps it up classic style - he's pretty easy on the eyes, too, and we get to see him both naked AND in a business suit - be still, my heart - Chloe Sevigny at first looks like she walked into the wrong movie but redeems herself later as Bale's \\"conscience\\" without being too much of a drag on the story. Reese Witherspoon is here but really has nothing to do as Patrick's girlfriend.<br />Definitely enjoyable for the over-the-top goofiness of it all.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Comedy CDs have always struck me as dumb. I figured if you want comedy - go to a movie (maybe a Jack Black movie) or a stand-up or something. Tenacious D has single-handedly changed my mind about comedy CDs with their debut self-titled album.<br />Cleverly mixing music and skit humor, Black and guitarist/friend/patsy Kyle Gass tackle issues that most people above fourty or under twelve would find offensive. Black's voice almost has a way of conveying feeling on you when you hear it, in that you can sense a certain seriousness or anger to it. This makes his comedy all the more effective, and is on display on this album. If you like Black in the movies (Shallow Hal, Orange County most recently) then you'll most likely enjoy him here as well.<br />Perhaps the best reason this CD can be labeled a success is the length of the tracks. Many comedy artists (see:Adam Sandler) sometimes make tracks so long that it is hard to stay focused on them, or it takes too long to get to the punchline. Never fear here, however, for Tenacious D has kept most of there tracks to a comfortable 2-2:30 length and also mixed in a good deal of music to spice it up.<br />Here's the real kicker. All that I've been preaching about is the comedy, but this group is actually passable as an excellent music group. Guitar-work at times is fantastic, and Black is a more talented singer than some other artists I can think of who don't have his humor to back it up.<br />Simply put, this is an album like no other, and must be experienced to be understood. If you are offended by profanity, or references to the male anatomy, however, you might want to steer clear of this album. The rest of you, give this a spin - you probably won't regret it.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1992 and enjoyed it immensely. In 2001 I was bowled over by \\"Moulin Rouge\\", but when I saw it, though I knew both movies were directed by Baz Luhrmann, much of \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" had faded from memory. Recently, I saw it again, and realized how very much it foreshadows its big, bold cousin. It stands on its own merits, but now it also looks strikingly like the genesis of \\"Moulin Rouge\\". There is also an irony. The main character is denounced and ridiculed by some of the movie's characters for the excesses and the flamboyance he uses in his work. Nine years later, Luhrmann endured the same criticisms for his directing style in \\"Moulin Rouge\\". <br />This is a comedy about a young man [Paul Mercurio] who grows up in the bizarre, insular world of Australian ballroom dance competitions. He's a marvelous dancer with a tendency to introduce his own steps. He wants to break the strict rules that have grown up in the competitions over the years. Thought a twist of fate, he finds a partner [Tara Morice] who also has a spirited and rebellious nature. Their battle to free up their little dancing world makes for a sweet, eccentric and charming movie. <br />Don't expect to find the razzle dazzle of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" here, simply because this is a little movie. I imagine its budget was fifty times less. But that's fine. It has plenty style, finesse and quirky glamour. There's also plenty of great music and dancing. Though comparisons to \\"Moulin Rouge\\" are inevitable, \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is perhaps more similar to two of my other favorite Aussie films - \\"Muriel's Wedding\\" and \\"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\\", both released in 1994.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the most bizarre yet extremely enjoyable CD's I've ever had. The album is definitely a deep shift from what the previous albums. Only on a couple of tracks will you hear the guitars and drums, but the rest are churned out by mechanic appliances, keyboards and synthesizers. In other words, if you thought Kid A was a big change you'll be even more surprised by this.<br />Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box- The tune of this song sounds like something from an old arcade machine or game boy as some sort of drumming dies in and out of the track.<br />Pyramid Song- Slow, emotional and reverant, Thom's sad vocals are accompanied with violins and an overall watery feel. It sings of heading to the afterlife.<br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors- Incessant, pounding beats repeat all throughout the song with a highly distorted Thom Yorke eerily describing the types of doors. Obviously carrying a deeper meaning, it sounds \\"evil\\" at the very least.<br />You And Whose Army?- Thom sounds very drunk in this one. It starts off slow and steady for most of the track and then finishes with a triumphant burst of sounds, symphony and energy.<br />I Might Be Wrong- A track that has sort of an electronic feel, yet it doesn't. I really don't know how to describe it, except it sounds very clean cut. Perhaps the most \\"modern\\" of the tracks.<br />Knives Out: One of the best tracks on the album. Sweeping melodies cover up disturbing and awkward lyrics. Always carries a strong steady tempo.<br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac- Fans of the original \\"Morning Bell\\" on the Kid A album will be in for a shock. While the lyrics and melody remain the same, it has a more orchestrated sound to it.<br />Dollars & Cents- This track sounds somewhat jazzy in a sense. It starts off fine and then becomes harsher and harsher while beating it's message into our minds. Clearly, the song is about how money has corrupted us.<br />Hunting Bears- No vocals. Just the sound of a warped guitar and the ocean droning on and off. Calm and restful at the very least.<br />Like Spinning Plates- My favorite. The sound is haunting with an eerie melody and Thom spouting the lyrics \\"While you make pretty speeches, I'm being cut to shreds\\". My best guess is that the song is about a world crashing and falling to pieces.<br />Life In A Glass House- Trumpets and horns blair from beginning to end with instruments carrying a dreary and exhausted sound. Whenever I hear it, I think of a drunken sailor.
0971855110|4.0|Of course I love Fly Lady's website ... With her methods of using routines, decluttering a little each day, and feeling good about yourself are for everyone.  Her system has been the only long-lasting, easy to do thing that has worked for me.  It has helped the whole family.  It seems impossible to spend less time cleaning and having a spotless house, but that's exactly what you get!  I wouldn't trade Flylady for all the money in the world!...

0812550706|3.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a regular story that was packaged with a science fiction backdrop to make it more appealing.  Ender's game does reflect problems in society by outlining the pressure that we put on the young to be number one. Ender's Game fails with grabbing the attention of an adult.  The relationship between Ender and his sibling, Peter and Valentine, along with Enders internal stuggle to be the best or do what is right are the most important relationships and conflicts in the novel.   Ender's game is a book for youth aged 10-16.  My imaginiation wouldn't allow me the opportunity to enjoy this novel.  I love science fiction but I think that Ender's Game fails at entertaining adult readers.
B00005Q45W|3.0|Now, I do hate to be a naysayer.  In a perfect world, nobody would ever have to complain about a Leonard Cohen album.  However, in a perfect world I don't think this would be called a Leonard Cohen album.<br />Granted, the lyrics are distinctly Cohen--their grim loveliness elevates them to a level far above your standard fare.  \\"Alexandra Leaving\\" and \\"Love Itself\\" give me chills when I read the words.  Unfortunately, when I listen to the song, I have to contend with the jarring conflict between Cohen's gritty voice and the sweetly mellow synth-pop of the Sade-like arrangements.  <br />Now, I don't know Sharon Robinson, and if she was responsible for helping to bring a Cohen album to the table, then I'm grateful to her.  She seems to be a competant backup singer, and have some ability with basic chord structure.  When she sings alone, her voice blends very nicely with her arrangements.  However, Cohen himself seems completely out of place--as though he were added at the last minute, as an afterthought.<br />Now, maybe this is intentional.  Maybe this disparity is supposed to represent an ironic commentary on the displacement of the poet in a fast food culture.  If so, it only emphasized fast food's ability to stick with you long into the night. Robinson's arrangments would be quite suitable for certain top ten lyrics (for example, the first song, \\"In My Secret Life,\\" works quite well with \\"Every Breath You Take\\"), and despite certain similarities in style to the arrangements on Cohen's album \\"I'm Your Man,\\" they never quite reach that level.  The contrivance of making the main vocal track considerably louder than the accompanying tracks only emphasizes the discontinuity between words and music, again making it seem that Cohen is only a guest on the album, and an unwelcome one at that.  <br />Clearly, I'm in the minority on this one, but if you are looking for great MUSIC, go back to \\"Famous Blue Raincoat,\\" by Jennifer Warnes.  If you're new to Cohen and want to appreciate him, try one of the best of albums, or \\"I'm Your Man.\\"  If you're a die-hard fan, and need to see what he's been doing for the past few years, buy the album, and you won't be disappointed by what he brings to the party.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be the host.  He's just the devil, standing over there in the corner with a microphone in his hand. Who knew he was a karaoke hog?

0767903862|5.0|I've just moved to Canberra, Australia from Texas and have fallen in love with this book!  While Mr Bryson was a bit hard on this beautiful city (OK, he eased up at the end of the chapter), generally speaking his observations of the people, the land and the culture could not be more right on.  I laughed out loud many times when I first read this book.  I still go back as a reference when I visit some of the same places that he wrote about.... and I laugh again.  He really captures the essence of this place so well with a sense of wit and insight that you will not find in any other travel book.  For anyone contemplating a visit down under this book is a must read.  That said, I recommend it to anyone who loves a well written, amusing book which goes a step beyond in insight and in historical context.  Highly recommended!!
0688170528|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book when I saw it in a used book store, but I changed my mind and decided to try it since I had never read anything by this author. I found it to be a little slow in the beginning and almost didn't finish it, but I had heard many good things about it so I continued reading. I was so intrigued by the plot and the characters! You get so attached to them as the story unfolds. I have never felt such a mix of emotions from the ending of a book before; sad and happy at once. I would definately recommend this book to everyone!
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is why I love Stevie Nicks.  This CD is like a journey through not only Stevie's life but through my own as well.  That is the beauty of her music.  Every song is like a story that you can read something deeper into.  She lays it all out there for everyone to see and hear.  As someone who is 24 she has brought another generation into her web and continues to mystify her life long fans.  Killer Album.  A must have!!
B000002VCW|5.0|If you are interested in getting into Al Stewart, this this is were to start. It is Al's most commercial album, although the lyrics are sometimes a little difficult to understand. Most of his music is pretty accessible, but this one probably has his finest collection of songs on a one studio album. Its also got On the Border in it, which is one of his most easily recognisable songs. All the songs on this album are excellent. Even the title track, my least favourite, is an excellent song. Broadway Hotel has got one of the most haunting violin solos I have ever heard on a rock album.<BR>Year of the Cat captures Al at his peak. By this time, he has left behind his early Dylaneque roots and refined his style into something uniquely his own. Unfortanately, from here on there is very little development as far as Al Stewart's sound is concerned. His subsequent albums are very similar in style to this period in his career, although, of course, the themes have been very wide-ranging.
0060934913|5.0|About 30 years ago, I worked in a restaurant kitchen for all of five days.  So I am no expert in the business.  But I value good food.<br />What sets Tony Bourdain apart from the stock _Food Channel_ crew of performers is his candor and hard-won understanding of food both as a passion and as a business.<br />This is not really the horror story some described when the book first appeared, and it will not put you off from eating in restaurants.  Maybe you will be a wiser consumer, and more apt to push your own limits and to try new fare.  That's all to the good.<br />But on a much more elemental level, what I really value about Bourdain is how he tackles, head-on, the really serious subject of our relationship with food.  This absolutely essential part of our lives gets the respect it deserves from Bourdain.<br />Bourdain has an easy and familiar writing style.  He is also clearly no peasant, but a thoughtful, sometimes disarmingly introspective man-- a persona that belies the &quot;tough guy in the kitchen&quot; image he must maintain to run a business.<br />Excellent and insightful.
B00004T6V4|5.0|I saw this movie about 2 years ago and thought it was fantastic, not just the story but the soundtrack as well (even gave me a tear in my eye, bloody wimp.) I bought the movie and searched high and low for the soundtrack, I finally found and purchased it from Amazon.com. The night I received my CD I played it 5 times, (listening to it now actually) I am wrapped, unlike other soundtracks the actors actually sing on this CD. \\"The flame still burns\\" and \\"All over the world\\" and brilliant. Not to mention \\"What might have been\\" and \\"Live for today\\" also great stuff. The whole disc is full of excellent music. The guitar works of Steve Donnelly are mesmorizing. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes original alternative music.
0452282152|3.0|A good book, not a great one.  Chevalier has created a fictional life for the girl with a pearl earring in Vermeer's luminous painting.  This artifice is effective, and there is ample detail about 17th century Holland to support the plot.  Yet the book is a light read.  An account of the girl's budding love life and the gossipy goings-on in Vermeer's household.  This will certainly appeal to those who prefer linear pop novels to deeper explorations of human or historical topics.  It's a book to be read in a weekend.
B00003CXTG|4.0|If you love romance movie than you'll love this, although I feel as if there was not enough story on &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; itself. It was all about romance. But it seemed as if something was missing. Anyway, overall this movie was great, if i had to describe this movie in as few words as possible it would be a &quot;Pop-up excitement,&quot; you'll never know what they'll hit you with.
0812550706|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. It's about this military genius that calls himself Ender (short for Andrew) who is put in \\"Battle School\\" to defend the human race against buggers, bug-like organisms with one mind in the bunch of thousands. However, all people know that he will be the commander of the fleet to stop them. So, they put Ender (his real name is Andrew Wiggins)into isolation. In battle school, this causes him problems, but he still has a group of friends.<br />When they promote him to Command School, he is six years too young, and, this time, he isn't around people his own age for any of the time. If he's not with teachers, he's with one teenager at a time, and he never sees one of them more than once. Finally, he only has one teacher: Mazer Rackham, the commander that defeated the buggers in the second invasion. Together, they have to find the rest of Ender's genius and get it to it's full potential before the next attack begins in five years.<br />Ender tires out, and, before long, he is relying heavily on his commanders, all of the students that were his friends and fellow commanders at Battle School. I wish I could say more, but then you wouldn't need to read the book, so this review would be a waste of time.
6305265488|5.0|This  was such a beutiful movie. It wasn't just another stupid fake fairytale remake, the movie was keepin' it real. I loved it because it wasn't so much of love at first site thing, and they fall in love. They get to know each other. There is not only love in there, for those who hate mushy stuff, there is also some sword fighting, intrigue, hate, betrayal etc. I could go on forever..
6305137293|4.0|Even if John Carpenter did not direct it, this still remains one of my all time favorite horror movies. Of course, it is very rare for a sequel to outshine its predecessor (only \\"Aliens\\" did manage to do that in horror cinematic history); especially if the original film is considered to be a classic by critics.<br />However, \\"Halloween 2\\" still manages to be a very enjoyable horror movie. It picks up exactly after the incidents of the original. Laurie Strode is taken to hospital, Michael Myers is still alive and once again innocent people will inevitably fall victims to his prey. Many previous reviewers have signalled the excessive amount of blood and gore present in this movie. And it's true. Just think of a nurse having all her blood drained out, or a person with a needle pinched in the middle of his eye.<br />This type of grotesque drama is surely a matter of taste, but anyone not minding a little blood-sheding here and there should definetely check out this sequel. Those who say that this movie lacks suspense are however quite wrong in my opinion. \\"Halloween 2\\" is full of heart-throbbing moments. The movie does not simply show Myers killing his victims in matter of  seconds, as witnessed for example by the famous bath-tub scene. The person playing Myers also did a fantastic job. \\"The Shape\\" has a very sort of mechanical movement this time round, which makes him less human and more frightengly threatening.<br />I only hope that Rick Rosenthal does another good job on the forthcoming \\"Halloween 8\\", even if personally I do not have high hopes for it. Donald Pleasence, we miss you. We truly do.
B0000640VN|3.0|Time travel is such a far-fetched theme in hard-scientific terms, that I guess it's understandable that movies that employ it have a tendency to become less science-fiction oriented and more simply ad hoc in how time travel is achieved. Such is especially true when travel into the past is involved. According to science fast-froward time travel is theoretically as simple as just travelling very fast in space, but back-in-time travel is far more conjectural, proposed to be possibly achievable by things so extreme and esoteric as falling into rotating black holes. No scientific theory makes falling off the Brooklyn Bridge at the right moment a means of time travel. So, no surprise that time travel movies become less science fiction and more ad hoc fantasy-drama, from PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED to FREQUENCY. So we should scarcely object to this movie as scientifically implausible; it's in a genre scarcely attempting to significantly resemble hard science fiction. But what makes it really kind of flaky is that its feel-good human drama is sometimes almost as implausible as its time-travel method. In this generally rather likeable story, Kate is very much what some might call a \\"Today's Woman\\". She functions in twenty-first century culture with contemporary values and aspirations. Yet she learns that it is somehow her blessed destiny to travel back over a century to live instead in a time when women couldn't even vote, not to mention all the other inevitable culture-shock awaiting her there. Okay, nostalgia for the past is valid to a point; we could learn some positive things from the past. But completely trying to have it both ways is a bit too much. All the changes in gender roles we've been told were vital to justice over the past few decades cannot be both liberating of women from past bondage AND at the same time be part of a modern world that one can only flee from to the old days of all the \\"degradations\\" that modern demands would \\"liberate\\" women from. So nostalgia here gets stretched into outright fantasy, not even counting the fantasy of the method of time travel. A woman like Kate (or virtually any other American woman more mainstream than the Amish) would surely find 1870s life more hellish than blessed if suddenly transported back there. If you can suspend disbelief on all levels, this movie can be a low-key feel-good diversion...
