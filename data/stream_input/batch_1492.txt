B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series but was a little disappointed with the last book.  It held my interest til about 2/3 of the way through and then it was like the authur ran out of new ideas and hurried the ending.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|AWESOME! This video has been well worth the wait. It's not hard to see why they call her \\"The Boss.\\" Diana has truly been a pioneer for many.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is challenging and lots of fun. I am addicted to it. the best thing about it is that it is progressively more difficult,  so it never gets boring.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I am total in love with this game. I mean its just plain awesome. gravity guy is difficult at some points but still rocks. all you people who gave it a bad review have issues. just kidding. Buy this game.  buy it
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather for kindle fire is a great app to have if you have access to wifi. It really is accurate. And it's not easy to predict weather patterns where I live. I think it is one of my favorite apps.
B0086700CM|5.0|I saw that my aunt got it on her ipod in February and I looked for it on my kindle but couldn't find it. When I saw that they have it now I got it immediately. I love it!!!
B00004STPT|1.0|I hit the search button after having entered \\"movie gladiator\\". The very 1st item presented said \\"Gladiator\\".....but did NOT say it was the musical score instead of the film. Read carefully!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|A bad sync wiped out all of my notes, setting me back at least two weeks. I think the free version was better... I can't trust this app anymore.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|May be the best weather app for national or intl weather data.  Service provided is also fast and professional. Always updates and improvements, too!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting! I found out about it on an iPhone 4s at the verizon store and was playing it for over 3 hours!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Dance of Death sounds like the band are having really good times working together, with outstanding input from all six members.  The lyrics are varied, but positive mood ultimately trumps.  The music is taking on seriously new directions for Maiden, with plenty of fresh ideas.  We are not in the 80's anymore, which will undoubtedly put off some of the old fan base - wonderful.  The individual tracks seem to fit in together well, and the end result is more coherent than Brave New World.  This is a real pleasure, this.<br /><br />PS I do like BNW, but I feel this album is a leap forward in comparison.  Again, love the three guitars and the variety they bring in the mix.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book truly does not deserve all the bad reviws it's been getting. Every book in the series has been phenomenal, although even though it doesn't really make sense to say it's the worst book in the series, one could still say it's the least good. Nonetheless, the book is a much better read for any fantasy fan than half the stuff people read now anyways.
1250000971|3.0|I love Jeffrey Archer and will read anything he writes however I was a little disappointed with this effort. I knew it was a middle book but was surprised at how short it was. The characters who were so beautifully developed in the first book fell so flat here. It seemed as if Archer was in a hurry to get this done and the story-telling suffered greatly in the process. It was definately not up to his usual standard. Could it be it was actually ghost-written by someone else?
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Ok so I admit I didn't want to go see it in theaters because in the previews it didn't look that great, and I only got it on here because I had nothing better to do. I'm really glad I got it. It was actually pretty good it has action, romance, and suspence. It wasn't a tired old story one where you knew everything that was going to happen before it happend. I wound recomend ot to those of you who are sceptical. I was very supprised and kinda wish I had went and seen it sooner.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is such a simple game but it is extremely addictive. I do not recommend unless you have a lot of time on your hand or have great will power! :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is hard to get more money and acorns but I'm at level 18 that's just cool. Everyone shold get this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly enjoy using this Bible app. I especially like all the different plans that are available to help you grow. in faith and gain a greater knowledge of the Word. I have this app on my blackberry Torch, iPod touch, &amp; now on my kindle fire. I LOVE carrying the Word with me wherever I go!
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|you should get this game because it is easy because you just have to tape it and he floated to the side.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I don't know what most people were smoking but I just loved this movie!!  While I didn't watch this movie in the theaters I did get the extra special copy of the four disc copy with the cool cover!!  :D  I asked my most trustworthy movie critic-friends and they loved this movie.  When I first saw a trailer for this film it reminded me of Frank Frazetta's work entitled Princess of Mars.  When I heard of the John Carter's extra abilities when he first gets there it reminded me of my astronomy professor who said that you would be able to do the same stuff as John Carter if you were able to go to Mars.  Due to the difference in gravity and atmosphere you could launch a baseball that far.  Since these books were written 100 YEARS AGO I loved the way the movie felt and how the idea of the day for the fantasy aspect of science fiction is related in the flick.  Maybe this is the reason some people cannot like this movie, for the pure idea of how people believed other worlds might be like so long ago?  Perhaps John Carter is another Bourn Identity where rental and dvd sales do better than when it was in theaters?  Let's hope so.  Oh, and I want a Woola!!  XD
B005723JSQ|5.0|I was hooked after the very first page and the pace of the story moved fast not, a dull moment!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best app ever<br />too good to be true I hope it gets better over time I want to see a new version with more games
1583334386|5.0|I first found this book in my public library... it looked interesting. I had to renew it after a few weeks because I did not want to part with it. Then, I brought it back 2 weeks late after the due date because I still could not part with it. I only read the first four chapters, and it was and has been so helpful so far in my life. It just makes so much sense. I also like the authors's small step approach to building willpower. It is also engraved in my mind now the habits I have formed or am forming. Are they beneficial to me after one year or negative... what about two or three years? My lifetime? I also like the way the author has you monitor yourself before your old habits take over... or how you feel mentally after you do something beneficial for yourself. I am certainly not any good at science or understanding the nitty gritty of how the human brain works, but I do understand what the author is conveying. This is a great book to have sitting out, and to encourage anyone with time to pick it up and start reading. The greatest thing is... I like the way you read a chapter, and then the author encourages you to practice what you have learned. Then come pick the book back up when you are confident to move on. At the end of the day... we are all looking for ways for self improvement, and this book puts it in very simple terms. By the way, I am someone who already thought I had a lot of willpower. I run 20 miles a week, workout regularly, watch what I eat, work 60+ hours a week, hands on mother etc. etc. Guess what? WE ALL HAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT!
B0086700CM|5.0|love it! so fun and for no cost!! download this game, you wont regret it. download it now! do it!
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|My favorite is the first movie, but this one might be the best of all. I look forward to watching it again at home. The special effects are really great.
1594745692|5.0|Giggle.  Snort. Roll on the floor laughing. Guaranteed you will do one or all of these if you get this deck!  What a complete package!  I gotta say, I just  got these cards today, and I can't stop looking at them.  I have been thru this deck three times, the third time literally with a magnifying glass...the authors have made the words \\"attention to detail\\" their mission statement.  Campy, hilarious, sick in a good way, and slightly disturbing- I haven't tried reading with them yet, I have been having too much fun looking at the cards, reading the not so little and not so white book included in the sturdy cardboard box, reading the BOX, reading the fine print on the cards...Wow, I can't put these guys down!  My favorite card is the...no, wait, it's the..., no I can't decide!  I love em all.  The very first card you see when you open the box is the Fool...boy, is that appropriate!  All I can say is if you love campy humour, zombies, and BOB's and survivalist stuff, oh, and Tarot, then get these cards!  They come in a 3x4x6 very sturdy cardboard box with a lift off top, great for storage-the box has litho type designs all over it, when lifting the top off, it looks as if you are lifting the lid on a box of hollow point ammo.  First up is the LWB, not so little, and not white! It's called The Mystical Prediction Oracle Instruction Booklet, complete with the mystical Zombie Swami head.  The book is written in a hilarious style, double entendres abound, and oh, actual layouts and card meanings included.  Be sure to read to the very last page, where you will find old fashioned ads for self defence lessons and Zom-B-Gone.  The cards are quite thick and stiff with a cardboard feel, measuring 2.75\\" x 4.75\\". The whole stack of 78 cards is 1&5/8ths thick, a handful to shuffle if you have small hands. The artwork is done in a campy, 50's bomb shelter vs Mad Men vs B grade horror flicks style . All the standard cards are there, from the Fool to the World, and Minor Arcana are the (un)usual Cups (braaaaiiiinnnsss), Wands (leg bones disconnected to the...), Swords (and axes, Uzis, shotguns,meat cleavers...) and (bio)Hazards (everyone needs their very own Pet Zombie, huh?) I must say, if I have to be really picky, the one thing that would have been the absolute icing on the birthday cake (see the 4 of Wands)would have been a scraggly, black, Zombie kittie on the Queen of Wands card.  sigh.e (un)usual Cups (braaaaiiiinnnsss), Wands (leg bones disconnected to the...), Swords (and axes, Uzis, shotguns,meat cleavers...) and (bio)Hazards (everyone needs their very own Pet Zombie, huh?)

B0086700CM|5.0|got to be the best running game ever! its sooooooo cool! i recomend this game to anyone! if you get enough little gold dimonds you can buy items and unlock new people.so take this advice. PRESS BUY!!!
B0087URXZU|5.0|Fantastic album from Joe Walsh.  Not a clunker to be found.  Favorites include \\"Analog Man\\" \\"Lucky That Way\\" \\"One Day At A Time\\" and the great instrumental that closes the album \\"India\\".
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Ms Harkness and based on this one, it won't be the last.  I could not put it down.  The writing was crisp and clear.  The characters  were interesting, and the plot was great.  I loved the twists and turns of the story line. Also for a change there were very few grammatical errors.  This ebook was edited well and proof-read.  It was a pleasure to read. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read the series and keep re-reading.  It's a complex relationship, but a good love story.  My only complaint is that it is written by a British author about an American couple in their 20's, and they use British slang, or terms an American couple in their 20's would never use.  But that's nitpicking.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I bought this album a few weeks ago and so far I have listened to it quite a bit. It's very addictive and it just gets better and better with each listen. It is great to hear original singer David Lee Roth back in the fold again, and Eddie Van Halen does some truly amazing guitar playing here, he really does. It's just an all around excellent album and I can't say enough good things about it. If Van Halen never releases another album again and goes out with this being their very last release, then they are going out in style. Personally, I hope they keep rocking forever.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: It's all good!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's pretty much Sim City Ice Age style so yeah if you have a moment to build a lil town it can be a little bit addictive plus its free so you cant really go too wrong.
B00785P2QC|5.0|What I love about this game is that you don't have to sit and watch it for hours. Although it does take time to earn money I absolutely love this game!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I explored different processeors, and im an INTEL guru, Intel is my brand of choice, but in this occasion where cost was an important aspect, this AMD showcased an alternative and after testing its living up to being a good processor for the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wonder what I have been doing with my life to not have read this book sooner. Read this one and the other 2 in 3 days. The invitation into this unfamiliar world, as the Twilight and Harry Potter series is what intrigues me first. The relationships and inner motivations are what made me not able to put the book down.<br /><br />I don't think this book is appropriate for youth or even young teen. Not only is there killing and loss, but suggestions of torture and mutilation is also present in the book. These scenes are pretty graphic and disturbing.<br /><br />All in all, a great read. Sad that I finished it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works well with simple mathematics but if needing a science calculator for more complex problems for calculus or algebra 2 I would buy a different calculator but overall it works quickly and adds what you need owns step ahead and efficiently.
B0073U2F12|1.0|3d was blurry, dark and barely 3d. Rent or get the non 3d copy. Its a decent movie with a good idea but lacks in the actual story. I didn't care about the charecters which can ruin a movie quickly.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Beatle fans will love this. Beautiful video and audio restoration. its like seeing for the first time as i did in 1968.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|The app works well enough. But after a month or so you automatically get logged out. If you dont log back in immediately you will get a notification about every 15 minutes until you log back in. Very very annoying when this happens at night trying to sleep. I dont use the app much so I just uninstalled it. Poor design flaw.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This film is one of the best films I have viewed this year. Due to the recent wave of amazing horror films from foreign countries it does'nt surprise me. I have to say the film is one of the most brutal films I have seen. The first half of the film is pretty brutal and when you think its going to end it continues on to another half that is much worse. A definite must have for fans of horror and shock cinema.
0345803485|1.0|There's no need to read the 'novel'dscribed anymore. From the comments it is already clear that what is beingsold by some 'publisher'is nothing but the kind of stuff that would easily sell to a readers'public who do not even deserve the name of 'readers'<br />I found this title while perusing some Spanish review. yes it has even found its way into the langusge of Cervantes.<br />My question : How does a product of 'literature'of this quality come under the heading of \\"vintage'?
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game its sooooooooo fun. i can play it all day. its good to play in ur spare time when u have nothing else to do. buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I HAVE A GOOD TIME PLAYING IT It is a lot of fun building family's. and catching scrat getting acorns is hard
B0086700CM|5.0|whoop whoop. Happy happy. Joy joy. Well worth the wait on the Kindle Fire. I need 5 more words. UGH!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I got the title from the high school library during a book sale. I read this book along with \\"Matched\\" within 3 days. I was so engrossed and could not put them down. I was disappointed that the third book of the trilogy is not available until November, 2012. If you love romantic books, this is a \\"must read\\"
B00846REIS|1.0|I bought it because of the hype. I wish I could un-read it. I'm not one to leave harsh reviews but honestly, I forced myself to finish.<br /><br />Pros: The sex was well written. Gideon kept me reading.<br /><br />Cons: I hated every sentence that came out of Eva's mouth. She was such a whiny character, i couldn't take it. Why Gideon wanted her was beyond me. Her issues were glossed over, and his weren't even addressed in any firm capacity. Vague references here and there didn't do anything but aggravate me that if I want to know, I'll have to wait for the second book. It just dragged. I was counting the pages until it was finished just so I could stop.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nothing overly complex.  simple games to occupy a few moments of dead time. those who have given poor reviews probably need to review what the purpose of a game is.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was the perfect fix for my boredom. It starts out fast and picks up the pace the longer you play. With dangers at almost every turn, it's a bit of challenge and frustration at first and definitely requires concentration. Perfect for those moments when there's nothing to do.
B007X16GFC|4.0|This movie has action. Bad guy is good actor bad roll. Twist are not unexpected. I like movie how things work out is good but hard to believe.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I feel like everyone else.  If it allows you to pay MORE money once you buy the game then I'm not interested no matter how good the game might be.
B007Z9R69M|3.0|Columbia, was better. Movie starts slow. Action is good. Seems very British (ie slow dry). Idea is dated so must be really good to be noticed. It is not really good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read all the books in the trilogy and to be honest I never expected this ending for Katniss Everdeen. It shocked me how she was not like her usual strong and brave self in this book but somehow I was still moved by her struggles to the point that I ended up liking her even more. If the trilogy will all be made into a movie like Twilight, I can't wait for the finale.
B0086700CM|5.0|its really great . I loved it. you can go on and on on different levels. and you can do so many different things
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|This album brings together so much of what made Pink Floyd such an influence in my life. I started listening to them during my college days in the 90s. The brooding, mellow vibe of this album along with Roger Waters' vocals put me into a relaxed, introspective place. The melodies and riffs are beautiful and unique. An excellent album I continue to listen to after all these years.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is fun but hard i would buy this if u want a challenge that is full of twists and turns
B0034G4P80|4.0|This movie was really enjoyable. It's not superb, therefore not quite a 5 star film, but I found it entertaining nonetheless. With so many other bad action movies, this one returns to one of Marvel's most powerful heroes. It was well-casted, well-acted and had plenty of good special effects that didn't take away from the feel of the movie. As a teaser to the Avengers, it was spot-on. Worth watching!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It's cool because I can access my compute and get important stuff and when my brother is on the computer... he thinks its haunted. AWESOME!
B000UR9T8C|2.0|The trailers for this movies had me excited to see the 'darker' side of Spider-Man. I was sorely disappointed. What could have been a good film was made mediocre by the choppiness and the fact that they crammed two villains into the script. They should've spent more time fleshing out one or the other but instead did a wretched job at painting the story. It was too long and too boring to work. Too bad they hacked up the franchise with this dud.
0876391277|5.0|Cette methode est tres bien faite avec beaucoup d effets interessant.<br /><br />C est parfait pour decouvrir des techniques particuliere au saxophone.<br /><br />Berklee College of musique a toujours de tres bon ouvrage et ce livre m a appris beaucoup sur des techinques de respirassion et de souffle.<br /><br />Le CD qui vient avec a de tres bon examples qui conviendont aux debutants comme aux experts.
B007IE4DSG|4.0|Not the quiet Beatle, but clearly the most thoughtful one, George Harrison shines in this ten track collection of demos.  I think it's a pity that George never did a tour of little clubs without a band, to show off his folky side, because the intimacy afforded by \\"Early Takes\\" shows how well it would have worked.<br /><br />George clearly was more comfortable in the folk tradition than either Lennon or McCartney, and he wasn't intimidated by Dylan like they were.  George also covers Dylan brilliantly, and could have done a really nice album of covers dedicated to his friend.  I wish they had included George's take of \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" from the 1992 Dylan tribute.<br /><br />In addition to some of his most affecting songs from \\"All Things Must Pass\\", this cd includes a lovely version of the Everly Brothers \\"Let it Be Me\\", and a stripped down version of \\"Woman Don't You Cry For Me\\".  Freed from the thumping disco bass of the \\"33 and 1/3\\" version, the song finally makes complete sense.  I only wish that the cd had credited the side musicians.  I assume that is Clapton on the electric guitar on \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\".  But I was curious about whether George ever handled the drums and bass by himself.
0439023513|2.0|I thought that parts of this book were great and had the same feel as the first two books.  However, about half way through the novel Katniss just becomes helpless.  She is no longer a survivor but someone who is totally reliant on everyone else.  The end is just rushed, plain and simple.  So many questions left unanswered and the few that are answered are done so poorly.  Not in the sense that I do not agree with what happened, but it just kind of happens with zero explanation.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|So good, different than Some Nights, not better or worse, just different. I like it more, depending on my mood.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow was awesome kept me entertained ufghf jgjgjgjg hy g g g h h hvgjgjf vhchfhfh I rote this so I could cimit it
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has gotten a lot of hype an has changes the sex lives for many married couples. I have to say given all of the excitement I am thoroughly disappointed. This book is very poorly written and is not about two people in love that like kinky sex. The story takes pIt's basically the beginning of a real life abusive relationship. I have a very difficult time understanding the women that find Christan Grey an attractive character. He is controlling. I am a woman who likes having an opinion and likes to actually order for herself at dinner. He treats Anastasia like a slave. I also dislike Anastasia. First of all, no virgin woman has multiple orgasms the first time she has sex. Secondly I have a hard time respecting a person who clearly doesn't respect herself. She lets her best friend push her around and then Christian. I have zero intention of reading the other two books.
B007NESBK2|2.0|I had high expectations for this BluRay but it let me down. The concert itself is pretty boring and the audio/video quality is average. Cameras are switching very fast to the point where it gets really annoying. Audio was a big disappointment (tried DTS-ES HD and Stereo PCM) when compared to most of the new concerts on BluRay. As much as I like Sade, I can't recommend this concert on BluRay.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing this awesome game.  I'm 62 years old and have never been hooked on anything....until<br /> now!  Get this app...you won't regret it. Peace

B001O1O71C|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was recommended to me by a friend and it was absolutely wonderful, but sad.  I recommend it to anyone.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It works really well &amp; I love playing on it. :) The reason for only 4 stars is there are ads that pop up before the game. :(
B0086700CM|2.0|The Game Gliches Too Much ! &amp; It's Way To Senstive &gt;_&lt; I love This Game &amp; Was So Excitied To See It As A App For The Kindle But It Needs To Be Fixed
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was phenomenal on the big screen in 3D and plays just as well on 2D at home.  I love the movie and enjoyed the director's commentary.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|I have been an avid Mission Impossible fan. I have seen all the movies and really don't mind catching a rerun on tv, but this movie just felt like it was lacking. I believe it was the combination of the characters and the writing, it just was not up to par with the past films in this franchise. It was actually difficult to stay focused on the movie and I found myself drifting into and out of full attention. I will say the action was great, the gadgets of course were fantastic, I just wish the story itself and the characters had better chemistry. Tom Cruise is not always my favorite person but he does nothing better than his role as Ethan Hunt.
B007YYY4WK|5.0|To be able to veiw a missed episode of a TV show that is sometimes is missed is a an excellent service.  I would highly recommend this service to anyone who asked.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles that are different.  so I like this app very much but I wish some of the puzzles were free.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|You do realize the lawsuit against them was dropped by the plaintiffs due to the fact that they had no evidence and the lawsuit was based on a hypothetical situation that never happened? But that's beside the point for most. It's much cooler to follow the blind mob.
B0086700CM|5.0|so much fun. I love it. My son and his friends play all the time so I downloaded it and haven't stopped playing.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Being adopted myself (given up by a young one) I got to thinking about my own juno out there and in a movie I was initially appose to seeing found a story I now find very special.<br />Its a story about a bright but goofy teenage girl and her very white bread(not in a racial way, I'm white lol), suburban crush with a craving for tic tacs Bleaker and an \\"experiment\\" gone terribly wrong.  After having sex for the first time in a chair juno finds herself pregnant and being an assertive little thing get in her mind she's gonna do right by the baby and not only put the baby up for adoption but find parents she sees fit.  She looks in the Penny Saver and this is the story that goes on from that.  Its not a sugar coated story of teen pregnancy but its not a depressing one either.  It simply approaches a sensitive topic with humor and along with a great soundtrack and a great cast including Jennifer Garner and Ellen Page.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Ok we waited 20years for new Joe, it was worth it!  Now maybe we could convience him for more, only sooner.  It's unbelievable the creativity of this man, who I saw at the University of Colorado in 1971, jammin' outside the Student Union.  His music is as great now as it was then.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for a long time they finally have it yea :)) I cant stop playing THIS GAME  thats how much I love it. &lt;3

B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Okay, i'll admit, this is not a 5 star film, I would give it around a 3.8 but since it's had such an unfair bad wrap by many i'll attempt to boost it a little.<br />First thing, Watch the ENTIRE movie people. Before you judge the \\"ending\\". ...The film, okay it's not quite Oscar stuff sure, and yes for the 1000th time \\"Wolves don't act like that\\" It's a Mooooovie people... BUT I found it to still be a pretty engaging film, there is a bigger story than some would have you believe. And yes, there are a few Hairy moments (no pun intended) and enough action to keep most watching. BTWay nor does this film disrespect Wolves or animals as some may profess. I think many have missed the point of the deeper meaning here. If you haven't seen it yet, please give it a try.
0767812387|5.0|I've always loved this movie. It just makes you believe that true love still exists. A great buy at a great price. 2 Thumbs up.
B0086700CM|4.0|it was fun and I have been waiting for it to come on kindle for a long time on I can play on the time

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I just finished reading this book (on my Kindle) and I enjoyed it. I read a fair number of the other reviews here before purchasing it, many negative, leading to some trepidation, but in the end I was not disappointed. Whether this is because my expectations had already been lowered, or because I am a less critical reader than others, or because the book is actually not as bad as its critics have claimed, is open to debate.<br />I want to address the most common complaints of those other reviews, namely that the book is just filler material, nothing happens, no plot points are resolved, etc.<br />The author states quite clearly in the preface to the previous book and this one, that the events of the two books (the 4th and 5th in the series) take place in parallel. He had too much material for one book, and instead of splitting that material chronologically, making two books each covering a shorter time period, he chose to instead split the characters into two groups, concentrating on one group in the fourth book and another group in this book. I don't think that was a good idea, and the result speaks for itself (irritated fans), but what's done is done. If you read the fourth book right after it was published and then had to wait a long time for the fifth book to come out, the effect of that decision is more pronounced. But now that both books are out, if you read this book while the previous one is still fresh in your mind, it is not as jarring.<br />The book is long, and some parts seem long-winded. Perhaps an editor should have taken a knife to it and trimmed a few sections. I mean, I an not really interested in every course that was served at a feast, the coat-of-arms of every man in a force, or the fate of every boat in a storm-tossed fleet. But the long-winded sections are not rampant. You are confronted with one occasionally. Considering the size of the book, if it had been trimmed by 20%, it would still have been plenty long enough in number of pages. If theauthor were being paid by the word (which I doubt), he'd still have made plenty of money. I don't find the idea credible that the author was deliberately padding out the novel. I suspect it is more a case of the publishers just trying to get the thing out the door. It's a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't situation. Another round of editing might have improved the book, but the fans might have had to wait another year to see it.<br />Since the events of the fourth and fifth books transpire within the same time frame, then in the chronology of the book's universe, you cannot say that something happened in the fourth book, but nothing in the fifth book -- everything that happened in one, happened in the other (notwithstanding that the fifth book's time-frame extends beyond that of the fourth book). Even taken on its own, this book does advance the plot, and it does resolve some plot points. Bran's long journey to find the three-eyed raven has a resolution. As in all the previous books, not all the (remaining) major characters survive.<br />Unless you were hoping for this to be the last book of the series, it obviously cannot resolve all the plot points. If it were the last book of the series, then some people would be moaning about that, trying to get their fixes by contributing their own (lame) fan fiction. If you're tiring of the series, and you just want the story to end so that you can close out your investment in it, then I guess you have a complaint. But if you like the series, and you want more, well, then you got what you wanted.<br />The pace of the story slowed down starting with the fourth book, and the slower pace continues in this one, but you can still feel it building toward a conclusion. If one of the things you most loved about the series was its pace in books one through three, and you didn't like the slowdown in book four, then this book is just going to exasperate you the same way the previous one did. Although I did prefer the faster paceof the first three books as well, I still find the story compelling even when if it is now more drug out.<br />You don't have to be a genius to predict that the result of Winter and the others coming down from the north, and a princess with dragons coming up from the south, is going to result in some cataclysmic battle, where the reintroduction of dragons into the world actually saves it, in spite of all the destruction they cause. I'm looking forward to it, just not as impatiently as some others.<br />GRRM is going to have to get his a-- moving on the next book (or books) though. If the TV series, just finishing up the second season, goes through more or less a book per season, and the production for a given season needs to start about a year in advance of its broadcast, and the next book therefore has to be available to serve as a guide for the development scripts, then we've got about two years until the scriptwriters needs book six.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Having enjoyed the first three books, mainly for the thought that went into imagining this fantastic world, this book is a huge let down. Certain quirks in his writing style that were only mildly annoying at first are magnified in the absence of any substance that they would otherwise have hidden behind. I find reading details of every layer of clothing of certain characters irrelevant and distracting from the storyline. The description of every insignificant sigil was just plain irritating. To dwell on physical traits of every single minor character seems like an attempt to only fill pages. To me that is what the book was full of. As though believing that there was not enough trivial information packed into the pages, the author also expatiates on the irrelevant gastronomical details wherever possible. this would be forgiven if at the end we were rewarded with at least a pretense of a story. It's almost as if GRRM is hoping he dies before he is expected to finally wrap up the series.<br />Overall, to me, this was a complete waste of time. It feels like the author has written this book while performing his morning rituals. I'm most definitely not spending any more money for the next book. Hopefully HBO can salvage Westeros.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't like dystopian fiction, which is what The Hunger Games is, but I was curious as to why everyone enjoyed it so much so I decided (After some convincing from a couple friends) to pick it up and read it. And just like that, I was hooked. I highly recommend this book series to kids 12 and up, as some parts can get a little gruesome. They are a quick read and I definitely recommend reading them.

0345803485|1.0|I only bought this book because a book club I'm in decided we should read it. Bad decision. I could not finish it, it's bad romance novel quality tripe. I find it hard to believe that women around the world are getting worked up over some very vanilla sex. I had to pretend to be sick the day the book club met rather than have to tell them I hated this book. Oh well... some people are loving it so I guess that's all that matters.
B004YR8AJI|4.0|I have used a Sonnet card reader before but wanted something faster that relied on the PciE interface instead of USB. When I saw this unit was released I jumped on it. A bit of background, I shoot a lot of pics in RAW on a pro DSLR and wanted something quick.<br /><br />After placing my order I was a little skeptical on how well this would work. Once it arrived I placed it in the expresscard slot on my MBP and nothing happened :( After about 5-10 mins of troubleshooting and browsing I found there was a driver required (Expresscard controller driver from JMicron). I installed it, rebooted and was ready to roll.<br /><br />I then inserted a 16GB UHS-1 SDHC card and started to transfer the images. I was amazed at the speed. I didn't even need to benchmark it as it was so much quicker.<br /><br />If you use SD/SDHC cards along with an expresscard slot and want something fast then run don't walk and buy this adapter it really is that good. I see Amazon is out of it currently and hope they bring it back in as I highly recommend this.

1416972250|5.0|This book was a really great ending to the Mortal Instruments trilogy. Everything was wrapped up so well. I am really not sure how I feel about there being a book 4 and 5 (and I assume 6). It ended so well; why go on? Why not just write a whole knew story? I don't know why every author these days thinks they need to write a 7-book story. It's so frustrating waiting a year between them and there are so many books on my list I never catch up!<br /><br />Anyway, I hear this is slated to be the next big movie series, now that Harry Potter and Twilight are over. I am excited. I liked this much better than Twilight, though not Harry Potter (and I don't need to mention the obvious similarities she seemed to pull from Harry Potter). I read a lot of young adult science-fiction in this category they are now calling paranormal teen romance, and there was one thing that immediately appealed to me: they did not treat the adults like clueless idiots. I suppose that is because the adults were Shadowhunters themselves. But in most YA books, the parents have no clue that their little darlings are having near-death experiences on a daily basis. The kids come home late, and get in trouble when they come up with the most ridiculous lies ever. In these books, everyone was honest with each other, for the most part. In fact, when Clary found out the truth about her heritage in Book 1, she decided she had to tell her best friend Simon immediately. She wasn't going to live a lie around him forever. And then, of course, the adults can actually help when things get tough. Most of the action was still focused on the teens, but at least the adults weren't imbeciles!<br /><br />I thought it was ambitious that the author did the brother-sister relationship between Clary and Jace. That was pretty unusual for a YA book. BUT... once they found out they were related, you'd think they'd be horrified, not mope like they'd lost the most wonderful thing in the world! They'd known each other what, a week?? Here, I really started to feel for Simon. He was Clary's best friend and they got along great. It was just like Edward, Bella and Jacob in Twilight. Bella always insisted Jacob was her best friend and she had lots of fun with him. But she was hopelessly in love with Edward, who was so moody she never smiled once when they were together. Jace was the same way: totally moody. He and Clary always argued. So you find out someone you always argue with is your brother and you've only known him a week, just forget about it and give your best friend a chance!<br /><br />So between books 1 and 3, poor Simon is turned into a vampire (a plot twist I really didn't care for), and Clary and Jace find out they are not brother and sister. Then they find out they are brother and sister. Then they find out they are not brother and sister. So they are all happy. I think it went something like that. But how happy can you be when the guy you are desperately in love with is so freaking moody all the time? This teenage stuff annoys me sometimes. Well, all the time. You cannot know you are meant to be with someone forever when you are 17 and have known someone for a month! Especially when your relationship has been so volatile so far.<br /><br />Well anyway, it was mostly a pretty good book and an excellent trilogy. I hope book 4 doesn't ruin it! I've read a couple scathing reviews but it mostly seems to be liked.? Here, I really started to feel for Simon. He was Clary's best friend and they got along great.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|First, I originally viewed this movie when it came out.  Several months ago this movie was on the Disney channel and I recorded it for my boys to watch, they are 5 and 2.  They both loved it.  Unfortunately, I recorded it in my room and everyday they would want to watch this movie so I decided to purchase it.  I was frustrated that Disney hadn't released a Blu-ray format for Lilo & Stitch but I knew it could be played on their blu-ray player and it could still be viewed in the car.  I think this is a great movie for little kids.  It has a good plot about people's ability to change.  The soundtrack is nice and the animation is very nice and colorful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I LOVED this twisted story! Now that I have discovered Gillian Flynn, I plan to read her other works of fiction as soon as possible.  This is a story that grabs the reader by the collar and refuses to let go.  BUY it now without delay!
1594203334|5.0|In Bringing up B&eacute;b&eacute;, by Pamela Druckerman, my own experiences as a bilingual, Franco-American child brought up in France and in the USA is spoken about poignantly.  Pamela's writing style is pleasant, with a mix of statistics, and storytelling.  I come from an American mother and a French father, and Pamela researches, observes, and puts in writing, experiences I have only had at an intuitive level.  I teach French, and wonder which style I tend to use more in my classroom. So many of her observations are so true. In particular, I was touched by her note on bilingually raised kids' experience of being American when going to France, and French when living in America.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. Thank You for a job well done! I was immediately sharing the tidbits with the 9 students I am accompanying to France this summer, as well as with my sister in law who is expecting her first child.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The title and the author intreged me into purchasing the book for my kindle.  After the secod chapter I kept my kindle where the grandkids wouldn't find it.  Definately soft porn.  I would not have purchased it if I had read a synopsis beforehand.  Not for anyone but adults!
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Vibrant visuals are the focus of this movie and like a lot of blockbuster films the story takes a back seat because who cares about plotting if you can bedazzle your audience? The cliff side settlements are something to behold and for those who want a feast for the eyes this is justifiably worth your money and time. Additionally, the costumes are noticeably impressive.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke does an admirable job as a brutal yet sometimes poetic villain (Hyperion). Several of the supporting cast are barely mediocre. Other actors I recognized were Stephen Dorff (the sarcastic rogue), Freida Pinto (as the oracle), Henry Cavill (Theseus), Isabel Lucas (Athena), and, of course, John Hurt (the old mentor to Theseus).<br /><br />When the Gods and Titans went at it I expected huge special effects which would make a 60th level World of Warcraft player feel jealous. Instead, I got a fight that was pretty basic which made me wonder if they just ran out of money. The Titans were wussbags and nothing like in the legends. Part of the reason they were entrapped was because it was impossible to kill them (well, most of the time) or they were kin and it was very bad to kill your family. In the movie they were just barbaric savages that were easily tossed aside (until the latter part of the fight when the movie creators figured they should make it challenging) and I wondered why the Greek Gods bothered entrapping them in the first place. Why not just kill them?<br /><br />The fight between Theseus and the Minotaur started with promise and then it ended in a manner which made me feel the big bad Minotaur of legends was a total wussbag.<br /><br />** SPOILERS BEGIN ***<br /><br />GREEK MYTHOLOGY ERRORS/OR JUST OFF:<br /><br />(1) There were actually 12 Titans, not 20, if we're talking about the first generation. If you include the second generation then it's okay, I suppose.; (2) There was no such thing as the Epirus Bow in Greek Mythology. Strange that they didn't just tap into themythology and use the Bow of Hercules. Then again, I believe Theseus never was known for using a bow so much as a special blade; (3) Theseus and Hyperion never fought it out. Hyperion is hardly mentioned in the mythologies; (4) Theseus never fought any army unless you include the Amazons; (5) Theseus' mother was the daughter of a  king so she was never a peasant so all the ridicule would have never happened. I think the creators wanted to create this common man so that audiences would supposedly relate to him more but you have to remember that a lot of the Greek heroes were in the nobility.; (6) Athena never died in Greek Mythology from Titan blows; (7) The Titans never escaped after the first godly battle in great mass though some were released at times and a minority of them didn't participate in the Titanomachy.; (8) The Greek Gods had no problem showing themselves to mortals in their full form. I suppose they put this in to explain why mortals didn't always believe in them and to relate it to the growing atheist crowds in America perhaps?; and (9) Zeus never killed Ares but he probably thought about doing it once or twice in the legends.<br /><br />GREEK MYTHOLOGY (PARTS THEY GOT RIGHT): (1) the Greek Gods and Titans fought in a ten year war called the Titanomachy; (2) Phaedra was the second wife of Theseus (though not an Oracle and I get they did that to try and make her cooler); (3) the fighting skills of Theseus were legendary. Probably more legendary than in this movie so the creators couldn't have mucked up that one; and (4) Theseus fought and prevailed against the Minotaur.<br /><br />** SPOILERS END ***<br /><br />The budget for this picture was estimated at $75M to $120M and it made over $226M at the Box Office. Like I said, sometimes the special effects and a decent to somewhat good story are enough to make it a blockbuster. But, let me say once again, the Minotaur and Titans were wussbags. Really.<br /><br />GREEK MYTHOLOGY ACCURACY: C to C plus; ACTION SCENES/CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: B; LANDSCAPE/COSTUMES/SCENERY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus (higher if you don't care about mythological accuracy).
B007F7XXKA|4.0|The author is a bit off on the Thai consumer. Consider Thai consumer stocks here have all more then doubled and trippled in price, in just the past 2-3 years!<br /><br />In the book he also misses the point a bit on mega- Bangkok which has largely grown outwards to the north and east to very large outskirts, and so is far more then just one big central city. Yet the point is largely correct in that Thailand is too dominated by its capital. On the other hand, if you read recent major works like \\"Triumph of the City\\" the convincing argument there is made how large cities contribute enormously to a country's productivity.  Minimum wages are increased now in Thailand to 300 Baht a day (10 US$) which will help alleviate the economic divide.
0307949486|2.0|Sorry, I found this quite painful to read. I would like to blame the Swedish to English translation, but the writing and editing bordered on terrible. Sure, an interesting story lurks within this arduous read, but I had to push myself near the edge of torture to plow through the sloppy writing to find out how it would end. I guess it is true that books no longer need to be well written or superbly edited to climb into the best-selling ranks. Sigh...
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I must say that the songs are pretty good in general,I found the suite (the last 3 songs) to be heartwrenchingly beautiful,my main problem is the production,it sounds very \\"college radio friendly\\" to me,real slick but not alot of \\"wall of sound\\" or strange chord changes like most of the other beach boys albums of the past,and it has alot of autotuning to it pretty all over the place,it has a very modern production but,like most of their albums,there really isn't much \\"production\\" to it,it sounds very manufactured with many songwriters on each song,it's like they took unfinisshed Brian Wilson stuff,got a bunch of songwriters,got a producer,Joe Thomas,then finished the songs then giving  producer created to Brian,kind of fake sounding,but I must say the songs are pretty good  and it's great to hear Brian writing songs with them again,My least favorite song is \\"beaches in mind\\",to me it sounds unfinished and forced,also I can't help but to think of \\"Bitches in mind\\" everytime i hear it..lol.. whether that was their intent I don't know but it's funny that I think that.all in all a good cd,which it had a couple more songs and maybe more of the suite that is missing from the cd,\\"Daybreak over the ocean\\" is basically a Mike Love solo song with some new beach boys dubbs on it..hope they do a second new cd soon..

0316023744|5.0|The sheer immensity of the Second World War is even now, after more ink has been spilt on it than on almost any other event in history, almost impossible to grasp. The war affected countless people in every conceivable small and big way, it changed the fate of innumerable nations and set the tone for issues with which we are still grappling, and it showcased the very best and very worst in human nature. Very few historians are capable of capturing this epic panorama of tragedy and triumph on paper. Happily for us, Antony Beevor is one of those chosen few who can. In the past few decades he has established himself as a war historian of the first rank. This volume can be seen as the culmination of a stellar career during which he has introduced us to the very nature of war and its human elements. Beevor's sweeping, magisterial account of this great conflict excels in three ways that are characteristic of his past scholarship on D-Day, Stalingrad and Berlin.<br /><br />Firstly, Beevor delivers the raw strategic and historical facts with a relentless, crisp pace, covering all major events, participants and theaters of war. The history is informed by a treasure trove of material cited in the notes, including personal sources such as the invaluable diary of Soviet correspondent Vasily Grossman. There are 50 chapters and the title of each chapter reflects the one or two key events narrated in it. The brevity of the chapters makes the book accessible and great for bedtime reading. A particular skill of Beevor's is in condensing the most important information in relatively brief paragraphs. Rather than provide separate extended quotes from the prime participants, he excerpts these quotes within the paragraphs. Even a book that is 800 pages long cannot possibly spend too much time on every single event; Beevor understands this and is remarkably facile at saying much in a minimum number of words. It's also worth comparing this volume with the acclaimed recent book by Max Hastings. Hastings's is more of an on-the-ground perspective detailing the travails and triumphs of ordinary people. Beevor's is a higher-level account that nonetheless includes enough personal details to bring out the brutality of the war. Both are outstanding.<br /><br />Unlike many other works, Beevor begins his story not with the traditional German invasion of Poland in 1939 but with the Soviet defeat of the Japanese in Manchuria one month earlier. In fact one of the major strengths of the book that sets it apart from many other volumes is its constant focus on the conflict in the Far East between Japan, China and the Soviet Union whose origins preceded European events. This theme surfaces regularly in the book as it should since the Japanese invasion of China, as exemplified by the horrific Rape of Nanking, was as momentous for the future of the war as anything else. Along the same lines, while Beevor does cover major battles in Europe and the Pacific like the Battle of Britain, France, El Alamein, Stalingrad, Pearl Harbor, Normandy, Italy, Midway and the U-Boat conflict with verve and clarity, he also has separate detailed chapters on (relatively) minor but still key war zones like Egypt, Greece and Burma. An especially rousing story is of the small Finnish army virtually demolishing the overwhelmingly large Soviet forces at the start of the war through guerrilla warfare. Large, clear maps displaying movements and sites of major battles accompany every account. Descriptions of weapons systems, code-breaking and terrain-specific equipment all benefit from Beevor's concise style. In chapters on the Holocaust and Soviet purges, he chillingly documents the incalculably horrific crimes of the twentieth century's two genocidal tyrants, Hitler and Stalin, even as he does not fail to detail their shrewd genius in manipulating human beings and events. Stalin especially clearly comes across as an egomaniacal but calculating strategist who ensured his share of the postwar spoils during meetings with Roosevelt and Churchill at Yalta, Tehran and Potsdam.<br /><br />Secondly, just as he did in past works, Beevor is remarkable at documenting the human element in the war in all its terrifying cruelty and redeeming glory. All the horrors of the war are on full display here; the NKVD murdering its own people by the hundreds of thousands, the Japanese mutilating Chinese women with bayonets, the cold killing soldiers so swiftly that they resembled grotesque ice sculptures, the citizens of Leningrad eating their own children in the face of desperate starvation and madness, Russian soldiers raping every female between eight and eighty after \\"liberating\\" Berlin, and of course, the systematic, industrialized mass murder of Jews during the Holocaust. One of Beevor's more gruesome new revelations is the rather widespread practice of cannibalism among the Japanese, with both the local population and POWs being consumed to various extents throughout the Pacific occupation. Another particularly disturbing and startling fact which I was not aware of concerns horrible experiments with biological agents performed on American POWs by Japanese doctors, often with fatal results. The disturbing thing is that Douglas MacArthur granted immunity from prosecution to these doctors in the hope that they would provide detailed records to the Allies. This story only drives home the fact that the war which Beevor writes of was unimaginably horrific and blurred moral boundaries, and particularly because it is unimaginably so, the passage of time should never blind us to it. While many deeds in the war were undoubtedly immoral, ambiguous morality was also a constant theme, whether it concerned MacArthur's behavior or the strategic bombing of German cities. We are still debating these issues.<br /><br />But there are also acts of incredible altruism described in here; ordinary Germans sacrificing themselves to protect Jews, hopelessly outnumbered Jews rising against monstrous despots (as in the Warsaw uprising), and people transcending religion, class and political sentiments to save the lives of total strangers. These accounts are accompanied by characteristically vivid - and at times amusing - character sketches which concisely showcase the essential qualities of major participants; for instance, Chamberlain is out of depth with his \\"winged collar, Edwardian mustache and rolled umbrella\\". All major human alliances, including the famously successful relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt, are chronicled with wit, compassion and insight. Another of Beevor's talents is in conveying the sheer absurdity and surreal nature of war; for example there's Hermann Goering complaining about the price of shattered glass panes during Kristallnacht, and the French gingerly broadcasting a song named \\"I will wait\\" even as German forces amassed across the border in plain sight in 1940. Most emblematic of how downright bizarre war can be is the story of a Korean private named Yang Kyoungjong who was captured and conscripted successively by the Japanese, the Soviets and the Germans.<br /><br />Finally, Beevor does a stunning job at giving us an idea of the sheer irrationality and utterly brutalizing nature of war and how it changes everyone and everything. Fifty or sixty years after the fact, the Second World War appears like a series of rationally realized if tragic incidents culminating in the victory of good over evil. It's accounts like this that dispel that illusion and tell us that so many events were just based on good or bad luck. But in concluding this magisterial narrative, Beevor leaves us with the caveat that in the irrationality of war lies hope, the possibility that things could have been different had people acted just a little differently. In case of the Second World War that would have translated to France, Britain and the United States recognizing Hitler's ominous and growing power in the 30s and banding together to stop him. Ofcourse it is convenient to conclude this in hindsight, but it still makes a case for always being alert in recognizing the wrong turns that human nature can take. Indeed, Beevor reminds us in the end that \\"moral choice is the fundamental element in human drama, because it lies at the very heart of humanity itself\\". This is a lesson we should remember until the end of time.

030758836X|3.0|Okay, here is the thing.  I like dark and twisted stories.  The twisted plotlines and authentically scarred characters  pull me and I am hooked.  Gillian Flynn wrote such a story line very well in Sharp Objects.  That is story is messed up but beautiful all the same.  Donna Tartt and Tana French are other authors that know how to write about those dark places in the human soul.  But it isn't just darkness in these stories that I love, there is also intensely developed characters and character driven plot lines but the presence of a very smart and impressive plot as well. Gone Girl was on my list of books to by for close to a year before it was released.  There are very few authors who can do this genre well.<br /><br />Gone Girl in the end is a decent read.  It is completely unpredictable, it is dark and the characters are twisted.  The story is told from the alternating point of view of a wife and husband.  The story pulls you in and you think that you know what is happening, you think you know the characters and then BAM.  Seriously BAM.  I don't want to write more about the surprises and plot twists because it will rob readers of the experience.  I thought the twists were amazing and well done.  Though admittedly, I was mad at the first major plot surprise.  I had to put the book (okay my kindle) down and walk away from the story for a short period of time.  But in the end I realized that Flynn was brilliant.  She made me buy in completely to a certain idea of what the couple and the story was about.<br /><br />Issues of gender and economics are themes that Flynn touched on in Sharp Objects and she does that in Gone Girl as well.  The main characters are without jobs, frustrated by the economy and have moved to a small dying midwest town.  Concepts of what make a woman appealing and what is expected from a woman are consistently but subtly danced around in both Sharp Objects and Gone Girl.  Family ties and relationships are unwound and what remains is not all that pretty.<br /><br />In the end, though, the characters were too far down the unlikable path for my taste.  They were not redeemable.  I like my characters flawed and hurting, thank you very much.  But to have nobody in the story be someone I can attach to?  To have only the side characters be the sympathetic ones?  That is a challenge for me.  There are certain scenes and phrases that one of the characters will say when he/she is mad (trying to be vague here ....) to describe other characters.  I felt it was just too shocking, that Flynn's goal may have been to push the boundaries and make readers uncomfortable just because rather than contributing to the storyline.  Now vulgar doesn't usually bother me and it really didn't bother me here, I just thought it was too much.<br /><br />So if you like dark, you like twisted and you enjoyed Flynn's other books then I suggest you read this.  Flynn's works tend to be shorter than Tana French's and Donna Tartt's.  They are definitely less involved and the characters, while rich in description, are not as complexly written.<br /><br />I'll leave you with an excerpt that will not spoil the story for you, but demonstrate that while this may not be Flynn's best work it is still good and she has an amazing ability to make brilliant observations about human beings in our modern world:<br /><br />\\"Being the cool girl means I am a hot, briliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and ******, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2 ... hot and understanding.  Cool Girls never get angry ....\\"
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Beautiful harmonies, cheezy but authentic BB music. Shades of classics from \\"Bluebirds Over The Mountain\\" to \\"Kokomo\\" to \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"Darlin'\\" (The melody of \\"Shelter From The Storm\\" (not Dylan's) borrows massively from the latter.)<br />\\"Bill & Sue\\" is absolutely hillarious, and Brian's seldom been known for his humor.<br />Bifurcated nicely into LP-like \\"sides\\"--the first side is FUN FUN FUN, the second contains the more reflective subject matter, a bit world weary, like most of us, but still full of life. Thank God they eschewed modern overproduction and trendiness. I also note the wonderful guitar work by David Marks, who departed the group in 1963, in favor of schooling.<br />In totality, a wonderful return of the (remaining) original Boys, though not all that original. Real feel of Sun and Sea.

Everyone has been telling me about this movie and since i am really into the hollacost i desided to get it. and it was just wounderful. the emotions threw this movie really get to you and makes you feel like you are really there. watching this happened. I think they need to show this movie in history class.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|I like horror movies, but it seems like most horror movies these days are really slasher films.  The more blood and guts, the better.  The Woman in Black doesn't follow this formula and it is most appreciated.<br /><br />Mr. Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young attorney sent to a small rural town with only one objective: close out the account of a recently deceased widow.  When he arrives in town, people treat him coldly and you are left wondering why.  Only one man (the most wonderfully talented Ciaran Hinds) offers to help him while he attempts to gather documentation at the widow's house.<br /><br />Soon after he arrives, children in the local town start dying.  Not only are they dying, they are committing suicide in the most horrible ways.  Does it have some connection with a woman in black seen at the old house?  Of course!<br /><br />The story is a little slower than most thrillers but it all comes together in the end and there are plenty opportunities to jump out of your skin.  The director goes for psychological scares instead of gruesome kills and it's totally worth it.  Excellent story, excellent cast.

B007X15GRQ|3.0|Mark Wahlberg is the go-to guy for action films.  He's a killer, a super star.  And he's in his usual role as guy who has to save someone.  This time he has to save his brother, who's gotten into trouble because he blew a smuggling job.  Now Wahlberg has to take on a larger smuggling job, which he swore he would never do again, to save his brother.<br /><br />Wait, does that sound familiar?  It's pretty much the story of Gone in 60 Seconds, but with a better lead actor and part of the story is set in South America.  (It even has Giovanni Ribisi!!)<br /><br />The reason I don't rate this movie higher is that the plot is lacking a little bit and there is an extraordinary amount of gruesome violence.  Don't get me wrong, I love action movies but there are a few times that I had to look away!  Overall though, it was a fun movie, you can't look away, and the ending is great.

B00009TB5G|5.0|If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, you must order the extended versions.  I ordered all three movies at once and spent the weekend watching.  Extended scenes add so much to the theatrical version that it almost feels as though it is a new movie all together.  Of course you will never be able to capture the whole magical expierence of the books on film, but the extended versions adds alot of details that you always felt were missing from the theatrical version.  Extended scenes flow with the original with the same quality and attention to detail.  Order all three extended versions for an enjoyable movie weekend.

I belive one reason I liked this a little better than [[ASIN:0345522648 Star Wars: Knight Errant (Star Wars (Del Rey))]]was because it had a lot of familar characters from the movies and you could relate to them.  This book is set further back in the past than the movies.  Very easy read, great page turner.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Pulled the trigger on this when Amazon had the one-day special of $29.99. That's basically the regular price of just the two first films alone! While I'm not at all a fan of the latter two films, for the money you can't beat this fully immersive set. I sat with it last night just flipping through the special features and I STILL haven't even scratched the surface. Is there anything Alien-related that ISN'T here???<br /><br />Even at the regular $52 Amazon price, if you're a fan of Alien, this is an incredible set. The hardbound book packaging is well done and I can't begin to express how satisfied I am with this set.

B003BWERF8|4.0|I got this to use my 6th generation Nano with GO bluetooth head phones.  At first I thought it would not sync with the headphones, then I discovered the problem was that I did not follow instructions for the new headphones. Then both worked flawlessly up to about 25 feet through outside walls.<br /><br />The limitation is that it will pair with only one bluetooth device.  This limitation is apparently necessary in order to have the capacity to control the ipod remotely (assuming that your remote device has control functions-- my GO headphones do not).  This remote control function might be very desirable for some users.  For others, it is useless or worse.  In my case, I would like to broadcast to bluetooth subwoofers as well as my headset.  So I will have to buy another, different dongle.<br /><br />Nonetheless, all in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|The style and concept of this game is very cool. Runs great on galaxy prevail, although it was a little laggy at first.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is so much packed into this book.  Yes, it's compelling plot plus compelling characters.  It unravels like the ascent of a spiral staircase, your perspective of the Wooliverse radically changing the further you climb.  But at the same time, there is so much to gain from concepts of humanity living in willful blindness (if under duress), complacency versus action, the senselessness of rules unquestioned.  This book could be studied and perhaps will be by future literature classes.  So many different ways to slice and analyze the messages and themes, all while a supreme story consumes your attention.<br /><br />Although nominally science fiction, I hope it breaks out of that pigeon hole.  It's too good not to.  It is also instantly cinematic, and will undoubtedly make for a successful film franchise, as long as Ridley Scott doesn't mess it up.  :)  Keep 'em coming, Hugh Howey!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh is a beautiful book about broken hearts and minds.  I have to say that this book is not what I would have picked for myself. In fact, one of my fellow BBB club members selected it and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Ms. Diffenbaugh takes you on an unforgettable journey of Victoria Jones, a broken young woman trying to find her place in the world.  Throughout the book you jump back and forth between Victoria as a child and then as an eighteen year old.<br /><br />Victoria was born and raised in a foster system where she was rarely nurtured or even held. As a child, she was placed in a foster home in hopes of being adopted.  However, due to tragic events, she was returned to a group home, never to be adopted.  Those events had a devastating effect on Victoria's life.  At eighteen years old, Victoria was emancipated from foster care and sent out into the world with little to no skills to connect with other people.<br /><br />However, the one thing Victoria could connect with was flowers. When she was a child, Elizabeth, her last foster mother, taught her the language of flowers that was used in the Victorian period. Flowers gave Victoria the ability to connect and help people. She could use flowers to communicate her feelings and project those feelings on others. Flowers became her entire world.  After reading this book, I wanted to create my own flower bouquet that reflected my feelings for others.  Of course, I couldn't.  But the itch was there.<br /><br />There are so many reasons why I loved this book. The way Ms. Diffenbaugh uses the past and present; you are able to understand the depth of Victoria's suffering. Most of the characters in this book have painful pasts. They seem to be drawn together based on the fact that they recognize that pain in each other. I love the level of acceptance that each character has for each other and the way that acceptance affects Victoria. The acceptance and forgiveness is overwhelming.<br /><br />I thought the ending was so fitting for Victoria.  It wasn't necessarily a happy ending but there is the hope of a happy ending.  If Ms. Diffenbaugh included a sticky sweet happily ever after, it would have left the readers with a horrible taste in their mouths.  Instead, she created an ending for Victoria that is very believable.  It gives you hope that healing can happen.lming.<br /><br />I thought the ending was so fitting for Victoria.

0439023491|4.0|If you have not read these books yet, you MUST!  \\"Catching Fire\\" picks up right where \\"Hunger Games\\" left off. Katniss, again the narrator, returns home to find herself more the center of attention than ever. The sinister President Snow surprises her with a visit, and Katniss's fear when Snow meets with her alone is sinister.  \\"Catching Fire\\" is roughly divided into three parts: Katniss and Peeta's mandatory Victory Tour through the districts, preparations for the 75th Annual Hunger Games, and a truncated version of the Games themselves. As rebellion grows, the President sets up his revenge; as the rebellion grows, Katniss evolves unknowingly as the rebels' symbolic leader. Since we know many of the characters, other areas can be developed more deeply. In the romance department, we all are interested in knowing  who does Katniss choose? Peeta, the loveable baker who has demonstrated his devotion to Katniss repeatedly during the games, or Gale, her childhood best friend with whom she hunted and shared secrets?<br /><br />Common disagreement is over whether \\"Catching Fire\\" was as good as the original book \\"Hunger Games\\" or not. I certainly struggled over giving it a 4 or a 5.  It is certainly  slower paced at times than its predecessor.  Also, there is a bit of rehashing of plot (with some twists), yet some redundancy is there. Unquestionably, \\"Mocking\\" will pick up right where \\"Catching Fire\\" left off.  Perhaps the major weaknesses of \\"Catching Fire\\" lies in how is ended, or how it does not really end. Since \\"Catching Fire\\" does not come to a logical conclusion (the action just stops to wait for the next book),  \\"Mocking\\" will begin at that point in the middle of the action that was \\"unresolved\\" from the previous book.  This is the reason I could not give \\"Catching Fire\\" a \\"5\\".  I loved the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy by Stage Larsson  which began with \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  This series did almost the same thing in that Book 3  (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) was really a continuation of Book 2 (The Girl Who Played With Fire), except it (Book 2) had a somewhat logical ending - not just a stop in the action as \\"Catching Fire\\" ended.  Regardless of the \\"cliffhanger\\" lack of an ending, \\"Catching Fire\\" remains enthralling and keeps the reader on edge waiting for the next thing to happen.  The pace does pick up as it moves toward the end. The reader is filled with angst, as the book is filled with intense emotions: traps, action, threats, betrayal, gestures, frustration, questionable alliances, compassion, cruelty to name a few. Despite the few weaknesses, it is still an amazing read!Nest) was really a continuation of Book 2 (The Girl Who Played With Fire), except it (Book 2) had a somewhat logical ending - not just a stop in the action as \\"Catching Fire\\" ended.

B007MJSQSK|5.0|I finally had the chance to watch The Adventures of TinTin with my son. It looked like a good movie when I first saw the preview and when I knew Steven Spielberg directed it, I expected a good film.<br /><br />Man was I blown away by this movie!<br /><br />The plot wastes no time getting into the action. Within a couple minutes we learned of the Unicorn: an old pirate ship with quite a history. TinTin purchases a model of the ship to which he immediately is approached by one man about it and then another. This ship certainly has a story behind it! The story goes 100 mph from there. From that point, there's not a moment to take a breath until the credits.<br /><br />The two main characters, TinTin and Captain Haddock, are great. TinTin's intent on a story and doesn't let fear stand in his wait of getting it. Haddock is a humorous drunk. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of interaction between the two.<br /><br />The animation in this movie is fantastic. Coupled with some awesome action scenes (in particular the flashback to the battle on the Unicorn and the chase through town near the end) the movie is nothing but fun. Spielberg has done a fantastic job of using animation to his advantage to get impossible angles, camera pans, and close-ups on the action.<br /><br />I highly recommend you see this movie. Have fun with it and don't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />NOTE: I suggest 8 and up can watch this film. There are a number of gunfights, murder, and alcohol usage throughout the film. If you prefer your youngster not be exposed to this, you might want to avoid this movie.

B007YA5NRO|5.0|I have used Nikon DSLRs for over thirty years and had been looking for a really good backup camera that would give me many of the same functions and programs available on a DSLR.  The Fuji X10 is an excellent camera.  But like most cameras these days, the owner's manual leaves much to be desired.  The book by White came out at the perfect time for me as it is providing easily readable and complete discussions of all of the cameras many functions.  I highly recommend for all owners of the X10, even those with lots of camera experience.
B001SMC91M|5.0|This is a very short album, barely passing the 30-minute mark, but is absolutely packed with fiery, uptempo, combustible funky and bluesy soul tunes, all powered by a blistering barrage of horns, piano, and guitar. Man, listening to the frenetic pace of this album almost takes my breath away. It's that good. Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears remind me of several other artists: Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, along with the J. Geils Band, and even the Black Crowes. Throw in the Gun Club for that Jeffrey Lee Pierce type of wild abandon while we're at it. I hear it. Really, the music on this CD has got the feel and soul and vibe of all those artists. Please, please, please, don't let any producers try and \\"smooth out\\" this band's rough and tumble style. I like it like this.
6304698798|4.0|The Good, The Bad And The Ugly features one of the best film scores ever, by Ennio Morricone at his creative greatest, and it soars in the way it's applied to enhance even the most routine scenes; dazzling cinematography, by Tonino Delli Colli, including some of the best and most realistic battle scenes ever filmed; and well written and well acted characters, by the Good- Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and the Bad- Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), this film is dominated by the Ugly, Tuco Ramirez, the Mexican bandito played by Eli Wallach. The character is sort of an even more stylized riff on the bandito, Calvero, he essayed in The Magnificent Seven, which saw that character absorb some of the lunacy of the samurai played by Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai; but that's what makes it even better. It's simply one of the greatest comedic performances in film history. He owns the picture, much in the same way as the Lee Van Cleef character owned For A Few Dollars More, and like Van Cleef's character, in that film, Tuco often outsmarts the Eastwood character, One simply cannot turn away, lest miss a sight gag or joke or wince of frustration that sets the screen alive. Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.<br /><br />The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually `feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film. This trend would reach its apex in Once Upon A Time In The West, but it started here, in this trilogy.

1439102813|5.0|This was a phenomenal book...about 100x better than Left Neglected. Lisa Genova took Alzheimer's, and she brought it to life in a character that was so likeable (not because she was kind, but because you somehow know her), and did it in a way we all can relate to-she didn't exaggerate it and she didn't minimize it. I LOVED that we saw life unfold through Alice's eyes. As the illness progressed I really felt like I had a glimpse of what living with Alzheimer's is like. I loved how we saw the different relationships, from each of the kids to her husband, and the evolution of each as Alice declined. Lisa had an opportunity to make a loser out of John and she didn't. It is so refreshing to see a marriage portrayed with ups and downs, but ultimately one that withstands life's struggles....it's just something we don't see a whole lot of. This is one book I can say when I was finished I immediately wanted to read again, and I hate that it had to end- I could have easily read another 300 pages about her.

B000059TEQ|2.0|When I was a boy, the film that dominated my earliest memories of pop culture was 1970's Love Story. From the music to the saying, `Love means never having to say you're sorry,' to Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal being everywhere, it was the biggest movie of its day; sort of what Titanic was to folks a decade ago. And, yes, like Titanic, it's a schlocky film. It has a few saving graces which place it above the doomed ocean liner picture, though. One, there's no Leonardo DiCaprio in the film. Yes, Ali MacGraw was a terribly wooden actress. Her wooden performance here is mind-numbing. But, it's still not as earnestly bad as DiCaprio's. Second, despite the title being meant to refer to the film's two leads, Oliver and Jenny, played by O'Neal and MacGraw, the far more interesting love story is that played out between father and son. O'Neal plays Oliver Barrett IV, while Ray Milland plays his father, Oliver Barrett III. And, it is this relationship, between WASP scion and patriarch, that is so good that it carries the otherwise predictable soap opera of a film over the threshold to passability as a film. Is it a great film? No way, but Ray Milland does give a great performance as the emotionally impotent father.<br /><br />  The film was directed by Arthur Hiller, a serviceable Hollywood journeyman, and adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name, by Erich Segal. I used to get Segal and the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard Bach, mixed up all the time, because of the Segal/Seagull and Erich/Bach `ch' connections. Also, both films come from the dippy-doo era of American literature. Anyone who is in their mid-forties or older will know the tale, but for the young'uns, a brief recap. Young Oliver meets Jenny Cavellari on campus, at Harvard. She goes to Radcliffe. They have a series of very fast paced scenes that are ill-wrought dialogue-wise. Nonetheless, much happens in the first twenty to thirty minutes, and, in this way, Love Story was a precursor to the MTV-like editing style that has gripped film for the last twenty or so years. But, technically, the film is quite good. Its use of montage, superimposition, scoring (although, at two or three times the theme song intrudes too loudly), editing, and giving snippets of a scene and letting the viewer fill in the rest, works, and credit should go to Hiller for giving his cinematographer, Dick Kratina, room to experiment. In modern films, this utilitarian concision does not happen. A film is cut quickly, but the viewer has no way of filling in the action, so you get a sort of narrative strobing, whereas in this film, the cuts work because the setups so strongly reinforce what will happen, which is confirmed no less than a scene or two later.<br /><br /> A final point, though. For a tearjerker, I was left dry. Love Story is schlock, pure and simple, but well made schlock. Cum-see, cum-sa.TV-like editing style that has gripped film for the last twenty or so years.

0307949508|3.0|Let me start saying that I enjoyed the book. I finished it without almost ever putting it down over one weekend. Enjoyment, however, does necessarily mean I consider this a good book. I do not. Given the context of a lazy weekend of bad weather, the book was worth the time spent. At the same time, I was disappointment many times at how the events turned out to be.<br /><br />Some detailed points:<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br /> - Although some heavy editing would improve it considerably, I liked the first third of the book, up to the point before Blomkvist finds out the murdered couple. Until that point in the story, you get most of Salander's character development and almost none of her new out-of-this-planet skills.<br /><br /> - After the murder, the story gets weak with all this side undeveloped characters and Deus ex machina plots. The worst was the boxer apparition who obviously was placed there just to fight the giant. The \\"lottery trick\\" was very unconvincing as well.<br /><br /> - All characters have strong moralities. That's not bad per se but these moral values are strongly marked as if the characters were robots. Most of them were always all good or all bad without almost any development. The most notably exception is Salander herself but as the book develops it is revealed that she is almost flawless despite all her past history. The way more flawed (and interesting) girl from the first book fades away here as the book progresses.<br /><br /> - The non-ending final chapter was very disappointing. This is not one book at all, but the first part of a bigger installment. The only way to make it worse would be to add a \\"to be continued...\\" after the last sentence.

0792163710|5.0|Mythic realism. That's the perfect term to describe director George Stevens' 1953 classic color Western Shane, one of the most unlikely great films I've ever seen. That's because much of the 117 minute long film plays out as if it's cheesy, with its lone, virtuous gunman who stands apart and above all others (a precursor to Clint Eastwood's characters in Sergio Leone's revolutionary Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti westerns), as a western version of the fathers of perfect nuclear families of the Eisenhower era sitcoms. Yet, below is a roiling realism that only serves to heighten the mythos, by contrast. This is the tension that is so unusual, yet remarkably powerful. I may have, when a boy, seen this film, in black and white, on television, for some scenes resonated as if I'd seen them long ago. Then again, such a seeming familiarity is part of the province of myth, and why this film achieves its greatness. It's a greatness that is wholly distinct from the more modern sort of Western that Leone pioneered in the following decade. Leone's films' greatness (especially his westerns) was based upon a knowledge of film, as a medium and art, whereas Shane reaches far back into the eons, to portray its lead character as something akin to a god, in a way as primal as the Gilgamesh epic. In this sense, what many of the film's detractors view as corniness, is archetypal characters and behaviors. But Stevens leavens this with well written characters and situations, and, to his credit, with believable villains who have real motivations, ones which actually gain a good deal of sympathy in the viewer.<br /><br />Shane has so many elements that modern cineastes tend to look down on- a defense of basic human virtues, a hero that is not tortured nor clay-footed, and a triumph of real honor, yet it is a better, and, yes, greater, film than just about any other western directed by anyone not named Leone, and is certainly greater than any of the westerns that starred John Wayne in them; which, by comparison, almost always reek of artifice, on some level. In many ways, it is a filmic myth that shares many elements with the myth delivered in Herman Hesse's novella, Siddhartha; which features a similar hero encountering his own rather diurnal opposition, but in a manner that elevates him, and his tale, to something more. But it also features a child-like perspective that wipes away any possible excesses of these pre-Modern `sins,' and in this regard the film joins two other worthy and underlooked films as classics of filmic child portrayals: Toho Studios' 1969 Godzilla's Revenge and 1944's The Curse Of The Cat People, directed by Robert Wise and produced by Val Lewton. Its mythic realism is so endemic to Shane that, strange as it sounds, the first and greatest film that comes to mind in matching it, in that regard, is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet, one can also see direct influences from it: note the scene where the family goes to sleep, and Joey and his parents say goodnight, along with each other's names, and Joey ends the scene by shouting out to Shane, who sleeps in the barn, `Goodnight, Shane!,' and one can see where the 1970s television drama, The Waltons, got its episode ending sequence of family members shouting goodnight to each other.<br /><br />  Shane is a film that spans the range of the human and cinematic experience, and it does so in a way that is classic, in the best sense of the word; from a scene where Shane and Starrett remove a tree stump and bond to the final image of Shane's lonesome ride back to the mountain skies, and is a pure fable.

B00005JKGZ|3.0|Overall, while Meet Me In St. Louis is a typical example of what Hollywood was churning out in that era (although with a much bigger budget, and in Technicolor), that simply does not say much, and certainly does not make the film something worth recommending, in and of itself. Dull, listless, and hopelessly stilted, about the only real arguments one could have about such a film is whether or not the characters were so unenjoyable due to the way they were written, the lifeless acting (save for Garland, who, naturally, dominates the screen), or both. It's also a good example of reputation trumping reality, as well as being a very long film- an hour and 53 minutes- of its genre, especially due to its generally listless soundtrack. The film also makes the annoying error of, in the opening sequence, set in the mid-summer of 1903, stating that there are only seven months to go until the fair, even though, it is in spring of 1904. But, again, this is a minor flaw. One can live with those if all the rest that is wrong with this film worked. Alack, it does not. But, at least there is still Judy Garland- those eyes, that voice, that emotion.<br /><br />  It is not in the great works of cinema that one discovers what it means to witness a superstar, for, often, in those films, even an average talent can shine. No, it's in mediocre films like Meet Me In St. Louis where the greatest talents take a film over, and make it memorable. If so, then one can only attribute the glowing critical success of this filmic mediocrity to the supernova that was Judy Garland. Yes, her star may have died in this world, but onscreen, it always is. Lucky Vincente Minelli. Luckier you.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Jason Statham, who is generally good in his action films, is very good playing a professional hit man who is bothered that he had to kill a man he liked. He decides to make it up to this man by training the man's son to be a professional killer. Of course, he should not have done so because the boy's father had told Statham that the boy was disturbed and unable to act properly and because the boy, who doesn't know who killed his father, is looking for the murderer to kill him. The action in the film is riveting.

B001AH6ZWY|4.0|This movie is an excellent resource for teaching about the tension between science and faith.  In the end it proposes an integrated approach of science and faith. It is also a great discussion starter for the origins of the universe and creation.  Is creation finite or does it continue to manifest itself?  Contact also critically looks at the role of government in natural resources and intellectual property.  Is space study and travel another manifest destiny scenario or will we be smarter than that?

B0007PALZ2|3.0|12 Monkeys is not a great film, due to previously mentioned flaws, and some other minor continuity issues, as well as the sometimes heavyhanded ties of James Cole to Jesus Christ (both JC's). Also, a caveat to anyone who has seen Marker's film, for this film will, unfortunately, seem far less adventurous artistically than it really is. But it works both as a time travel fable and the depiction of an insane mind because event though, in the film's diegetic reality, Cole seems to be a genuine time traveler, he is almost assuredly a madman, as well. As is Dr. Railly, who violates one of the cardinal rules of her profession, becoming emotionally and sexually involved with her patient. It is also one of the rare films that benefited from later historical events; in this case, obviously 9/11, for both Cole and Peters provide excellent depictions of the differing halves of the criminal/terrorist mindsets of believing in their own realities and the rectitude of their actions, despite the violence incurred. Thus, while 12 Monkeys is not a film in a league with other sci fi films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, nor is it as daring as Gilliam's own earlier Brazil, it is a film of quality. And the fact that it was spawned in Hollywood shows that randomness can be a very, very good thing, in or out of the time travel scenario.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|Stephen Hunter's Swagger books, about the country folk father and the son, both unusual marksmen, are superb. I recommend them. They are, of course, better than the movie, but this is usually the case when books are made into films. Nevertheless, the film is excellent. There is no let up in the action. The plot is superb, with its twists and turns, and the ever honest idealistic Bobby Lee Swagger does what he feels he has to do and he does so humbly, without swagger, but with gusto.

In the past I have started micro-businesses with minimum start up fund, less than $100, and though my businesses did not continue to this day, I did made profits from the operations.<br /><br />There are two points made in this book that I thought were really true: 1. Give customers what they want, NOT what you think they would want, and 2. Sell your product/service's benefits, not it's features. Purchases are mostly emotional, you want to invoke emotions, not a boring list of features.<br /><br />Since people will be able to interpret/relate to this book based on their own experiences and aspirations, I'll leave the rest for you to figure out.<br /><br />Get this book and good luck!
0765316994|4.0|In short: This novel is emotionally deep but at the cost of complexity in this universe.<br />I am a huge fan of Scalzi's other works, and read this novel expecting sarcastic characters in an odd story set in an intriguing universe. This novel certainly satisfied the 'odd story' bit, but the universe's complexity was sacrificed to further the emotional development of the characters, and the characters themselves weren't as sarcastic as protagonists from Scalzi's other works. Furthermore, this story was much more intricate than any of the other science fiction Scalzi has written. I tend to appreciate stories which have a neat universe to ponder after the story has ended, which is one of the reasons I really love Scalzi's other books; this one is not as good of a universe, but is a much deeper and more emotional novel than any others I have read of his. It is still a great novel which still leaves the reader thinking about the implications of the story long after reading it, but in a fundamentally different way than Scalzi's other works. One last note: read the codas, they are not necessary for the primary storyline, but are where the emotional complexity of the novel is truly fleshed out.

B007V80WUC|5.0|I've been a huge CM fan since 2008, right after Isolate was released in 2007. Isolate has since become, in my opinion, one of my all time favorite albums, setting a benchmark for other bands to compete with. They have a very distinct, solid, high quality sound, with every musician in the band dominating their instrument. So, after waiting patiently for 4 years, I had really high expectations for this new release. My initial reaction was a bit uncertain. I felt that the material is definitely different, and the first thing that really stood out to me was the incredibly high quality, up front guitar-work.<br /><br />After listening to the album multiple times so far.. in my car, through speakers, through headphones, etc.. I can say this album is truly a FANTASTIC piece of work. Try to be open minded, and really listen to the music. Approach it as a separate album than Isolate. These guys are beyond a talented band. They are truly moving the genre through to the next level. The overall production is absolutely phenomenal, and despite a more low-key performance by Michael Eriksen (vocals), everything blends very well, and the vocals are superb. Like I mentioned before, the guitar-work is something that really stands out, with a very clean, up front, spot-on sound. A lot of heavy riffs, keyboard/guitar solos, and yet a bit scaled back compared to Isolate. \\"The One\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this release, and I suggest to those considering making the purchase.. DO SO! You will not regret it. It looks like some are disappointed so far, listening to it with certain expectations (like I did at first). Give it time. Keep listening to it, and absorb everything it has to offer. This is an AMAZING album, and I absolutely cannot wait to hear what else they have to offer. Great job CM!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As a fan of the original Barsoom (Mars) series by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, I was very excited to see this movie when it came out. Director Andrew Stanton did not disappoint, but I didn't really think he would with the previous great hits he produced of Wall-E and Finding Nemo. Taylor Kitsch was great as the hero John Carter, and though I had my doubts about her initially, Lynn Collins was fabulous as the Martian Princess Dejah Thoris. The scene where John Carter leaps into the sky (Mars has lower gravity) to save her made me almost giggle with glee. I've since had fantasies of being able to leap like that . . . something that rarely happens after seeing a movie these days.<br /><br />Now that I have my Blu-Ray set, I'm glad to own this great movie. From the opening titles describing the dying Mars to the final scene where John is able to return to the planet he now considers his home (and to the woman he loves!) the movie will suck you into it. In the realm of classic Science Fiction, this one can go toe to toe with some of the greats. Having influenced everything from Flash Gordon to Avatar, the Mars stories by Burroughs are the granddaddy of adventure science fiction, and this movie was a great translation to the big screen.<br /><br />\\"A Princess of Mars\\" came out in 1912. In 2012, John Carter made his leap to the big screen. This original science fiction hero has never looked better.

B005FISC52|4.0|This season was so jam-packed with chaos that my love for the characters only grew as they struggled with their new found problems. Some of them seemed a bit outrageous and only stuck in the script because it was the last season, i.e. Nathan being kid-napped, Mouth gaining weight, Clay's blocked memory and new found son?? Seriously these were a bit much for me. The return of Chris Keller was probably the high point of the season in my opinion. He brought back the comedy for such a dark season. I give the season 4 stars because it's one of my favorite series and it wasn't half bad. The ridiculousness did leave me wanting more. I just wish Lucas and Peyton could have had a full blown return.
B005LAIGPU|3.0|This movie was Ok,i mean it start's off with this kid,who is using his camera to film his life.At first he is filming his door,then his dad begins banging on the door,because he is drunk.And that's how the story begin's he start's filming everything.to sum it up short,its about this kid who's mother is dieing,and he has a dead beat dad,and he has a bit of a messed up life.So him and his friend's find a hole in the ground,they decide to go into the hole,to see what they can find.then him,and his two friend's gain super power's.and like anyone else they try to learn there super powers,and when they find out there power's they try to make there power's more Stronger,well i won't say anymore because i really don't wanna mess up the ending for people who have not watch this,and who wanna watch this.But i will say i do like the fact,that they try to make it more realistic,seeing through the camera of the kid,from the beginning to the end.but all i can say,is that this movie is good to rent,but for me i would not buy,and i don't plan on buying this.
0345803507|5.0|A very great read!! It kept you wanting to read more.  Would love another 5 books in this series!! Not for the faint of heart!
0060245867|3.0|This is an \\"OK\\" book. Was good enough for couple readings. Unlike some other books, this one is not so popular with my little one - he never asks to read it again.
B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of free fun.  You can unlock gameplay items just by playing...no purchase required.  I highly recommend it.  It's awesome.

0385535139|1.0|I actually listened to The Litigators on a sound recording.  It had to be the worst John Grisham book I have ever listened to.  It was boring, predictable and downright, to be crass \\"stupid.\\"  I hated it.  I work in a library and love books.  I did not love this one.
0553328255|4.0|This is I would say one of the best deals. The 2 books include all the 4 novels and 56 short stories. They are in very good condition and just for $7 plus shipping. I guess its good to have this in collection if you are a sherlock fan
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Like the title says,  this game is extremely addicting. The challenge of unlocking all of the games keeps you locked in.

1612130283|5.0|This is the first book I have read in probably 10 years outside of college textbooks, and I completed it in less than 3 days. I was utterly enthralled by the books, and simply cannot wait for more from EL James.
1781161313|4.0|The book is wonderfully fun for fans of the franchise and takes its subject matter seriously which makes it a great little read, but why is Ron Cobb not credited or even acknowledged anywhere in it as the artist responsible for about 50% of the sketches and designs on its pages? Even David Fincher gets a credit, but not Cobb. Come on, guys...
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|Not a fast moving game, requires some thought, and concentration. The little fuzzies blink at you while thinking about your next move.

0061766089|4.0|Many appear to think that great ideas in life just spring unsummoned to the minds of lucky people.  Not so, says Tim Brown and he's in a position to know as the CEO and President of IDEO, one of the more highly ranked innovative companies in the world.<br /><br />Brown coins the concept of \\"Design Thinking\\" to explains the process which is human-centered rather than just process oriented.  To make the revelation more complete, while certainly sharing some successes using this method, failures are shared as well.<br /><br />This is not a particularly easy reading book, but it's definitely worth the effort to read and understand for those with some business experience.<br /><br />bart breen  4 stars  Recommended
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm soo satistified with this game very very very addicting I reccomend this to anyone who likes adventures and cool graphics
B000O174CM|4.0|Another musical masterpiece in so-called \\"urban\\" cinema. A film-e-clef, the movie captured, in essence, the blueprint on how most of the musical acts we know got famous and the aftermath of that fame. I've read that certain people loosely or vaguely portrayed in the film may have not been pleased, but this wasn't a biography, it was a film (and based on a play at that). Murphy rightly won high acclaim for his role; when his conscious single isn't picked up, his non-verbal disdain cut me pretty deep. Beyonce was perfect for the role, and it was because of what her character was told by Foxx's toward the end of the film about why she was chosen to be the lead. If we don't watch out, Beyonce' will be the next Cher (is it already happening?). Foxx's character was somewhat disappointing. I really could've used more depth. He was just vicious just because according to the script, so they should have should've taken greater risks with him. Although Murphy was my favorite thing about this movie, Hudson stole the show. She had no weak points in the movie, and though she's...well, Effie....you end up rooting for her by the end. Glover played a very underappreciated role in the film, and reminded me of older gentlemen that I know in real life. Rose had a surprisingly enjoyable role that purposely stayed in the background, though she shot life into the limited screen time she had. Need more films like this, please and thank you.
B00000251N|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Extremely pleased with seller and Amazon. NOTE:<br />  I have wanted this music since I bought it on 8 track in 1978 when I was stationed at Elmendorf AFB, Anchorage, Alaska where I was stationed with the 21st Security Police Squadron. I listened to it all night long. I remember the click-clack as it changed tracks that would wake me up in the middle of the Alaska night, and I always found myself comforted by Neil Diamonds easy going and soothing voice and the wonderful music in Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Being thousands of miles away from my home and family in Minnesota, I needed something to relax me and bring me some peace, and this music was just perfect. I am grateful to God to have this great soundtrack to listen to again! K L Rogers
B000I8HIR2|2.0|I am a guy who loves horror movies, the more scary or disturbing the better. I thought this looked pretty good and scary but it really was not ... more of a thriller than a horror.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased this book reluctantly, as my book club was interested in reading 50 Shades of Grey and as I was interested in seeing what all the fuss was about.  This book is poorly written, the characters are underdeveloped, the language used is terrible, and the story line is flat.  The only well-written parts of this book are the incredibly descriptive sex scenes.  I'm not sure why it's called a book actually.  It should just be called the pornographic writings of a bored housewife.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it it is so cool with all the games but some are hard and somme are really easy love it for the most part
0060920432|5.0|I would just like to address the people who give this book bad reviews because they say he doesn't explain how to reach this flow state. I think that's absurd because throughout the whole book he gives examples of ways that people treat their everyday chores/work with attention so that they can improve and make a game out of whatever it is they're doing. I think it's a perspective you can use for anything you do. It's super interesting to read and also can change your perspective on how you go about life.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is anfun and addicting game. I would defiently reccomend it to people who like to try to beat theirs/others high scores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy that it has finally been made for the kindle. I haven't stop playing since I downloaded it.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|Restaurant Story is a fun mindless game I can sit and play and relax.  The app works fine.  For the people complaining about how they want you to buy stuff.... How do you think they make their money?  You don't have to spend any money if you don't want to. I have never spent a cent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son likes to play Kung Fu Scrat. I enjoy  decorating the village. I don't buy anything extra &amp; the game is still fun.
B004ZN9OTG|2.0|There are those on this thread who find this album musically compelling, but this long-time Floydian isn't one of them. No disrespect intended. That being said, the 2011 remaster provides a richer and fuller sound that is well worth the purchase price... IF you liked this album in the first place. However, if you are unfamiliar with the material on this album, I highly recommend you spend a little time on the web, listen to each track all the way thru and know what you're buying before you plunk down your hard-earned cash. IMHO, this is the single weakest entry in the Floyd catalog. Two stars because Fat Old Sun is a cool tune.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Those people arguing about in app purchases are idiots. If you don't like in app purchases, don't buy them! You can enjoy the game without them, and when you complete story, you can test your skills in endless, or play with your friends. I have never seen a game with such amazing multiplayer mechanics. Don't Listen to that angry mob of idiots giving 1 star to your amazing game, miniclip. I think you are doing great!
B00005JNQS|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. When it first came out on dvd I was working at a day care. My boss bought the dvd for the kids. That was the first time I watched this movie. We enjoyed it so much. After I bought Robots and I am so happy with the perches.
B003EYVXT6|1.0|I almost always agree with Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone magazine. Well maybe he was partly right when he wrote \\"Provocative\\" . It provoked me to throw the movie out.

B004J4X73K|4.0|Because of the nature of the Nightrunner series, I feel that a little background of my taste in these books is in order. Many people prefer certain books in the series over others, and I believe that knowing which books I preferred will give a better frame of reference.<br /><br />I adored the first two books, particularly the contrast between the lighthearted protagonists' parties and burglaries (and the budding romance, which was surprising well-paced) and the grisly details of necromancy, torture, and death. The third book kept me interested by developing the relationship between the characters and giving some much-desired detail about Seregil's past, family, and homeland. However, I preferred the fourth book, which many others didn't seem to care for. It brought back many of the more grisly elements and separated the protagonists, keeping their relationship from going stale for the readers. It was very character-driven, something I always enjoy. The fifth book dealt mostly with the repercussions of the fourth book, which was absolutely necessary, and brought resolution to its loose ends.<br /><br />In Casket of Souls, the sixth book, we find the protagonists once again balancing life between their noble facade and the Stag and Otter (which replaced The Cockerel, from the first two books, as their hideout). Unlike the first two books, though, the Stag and Otter isn't their main residence. They're spending a lot more time with the nobility, going to salons and shows instead of burgling, and it really slows the pace of the novel. One third of the way into the book, I still wasn't sure what the main plot thread was. And then, finally, the gloves came off and the killing started.<br /><br />One thing I've always admired about Flewelling is her willingness to kill off characters - not just the bad guys, but characters you really care about - and the way she goes about it. Sympathetic characters aren't just killed off to add drama to the books, or for a moment's angst;they're killed off because it furthers the plot. That is equally true in this novel, and something I've really missed since the first two novels.<br /><br />Another thing I've always admired is the way she allows characters to make mistakes. They don't immediately understand all of the details about a situation; they make some bad assumptions, or hold off on making any assumptions at all because they know things are serious and assumptions could get them killed. They dismiss important details because, at the time, they don't think they're important. There are no \\"for some reason he couldn't explain, he picked up the seemingly unimportant scrap of paper\\" moments. There are, however, several \\"he read over the contents of the letters, but they were nothing important\\" only to realize - later, while reflecting after the threat of being caught had passed - that there's no reason to hide letters THAT harmless in a locked compartment of a hidden drawer behind a false panel in the wall.<br /><br />Pacing aside, the main characters' relationship lost a lot of luster in this one. The first two books, while not letting the romance get in the way of the actual plot, developed the relationship to the point where both characters could admit their mutual feelings for one another. The third book developed the relationship itself, with all of the normal trust issues that most relationships suffer in the first year or two: dealing with the past, rivals, etc. The fourth and fifth book tested their relationship in new ways - separation, children, and a difference of opinion about their future. In this book, though, they've arrived at a comfortable point in their relationship, and it's great. However, if there weren't occasional references to the fact that they are, in fact, lovers, the relationship would have gone completely unnoticed.<br /><br />And, while I admire the realism she frequently employs (see \\"killing characters\\" and \\"letting them make mistakes), I really expected the previous novels to have more of an effect on this one. I was really glad that we didn't get the \\"then we went to the Stag and Otter, which replaced the Cockerel after it burnt down when...\\" that most sequels are bogged down with. However, I still expected certain things to remind characters of previous events - especially the traumatic events that tend to haunt real people for years. Flewelling did a great job of this in earlier novels, with certain deaths haunting Seregil for quite a while. This time around, despite numerous times where I was reminded of earlier events/losses, the characters mostly didn't notice. For me, this made the book seem rather disconnected from the previous books.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book. However, I think that was due more to my attachment to the characters than the merits of the book on its own.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|hate this amazon 20 word requirement. this is nice, simple calculator with nice graphics for kindle fire. sometimes simplicity is the best draw for an app.
0439023513|2.0|Very slow and boring. Nothing like the first book. Katniss is depressed and incredibly annoying. You couldn't pay me to read this again.  Read Divergent instead. Good book
B001NERPHS|2.0|I was expecting some sort of magic here instead it sounds like an amateur band rehearsing in an old barn.  Songs and playing are just not very good.  You can skip this one.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Not worth the effort it takes to download. In application purchasing is irritating and the game play isn't very fun.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|No Doubt has that soft smooth melody D i enjoy listening to this album i have never heard such beautiful music in my life that i can understand. There like mix with reggae and rock what a good i deal maybe i would start smoking weed again.
0345803485|5.0|I really loved this book!  I could not put it down, and had to keep reading every moment I could, so that I could finish.  Then I was sad that it was over, and I am very glad that I have book 2.  Anastasia Steele is a sweet, innocent virgin when she first meets Christian Grey, a rich, domineering, handsome man.  He is dark and controlling, and very sexy.  Anastasia, who has never had a boyfriend falls madly in love with Christian, and he with her.  She finds out about his need to control and dominate her in and out of the bedroom.  It makes her go through some very complex emotions, as she has no one to compare their relationship with, and can not talk about the more salacious aspects with her best friends due to Christian's NDA.  She ends up torn between her feelings of love for him, and her fear of his punishments, and fear that he can not love her in the same way.  This is definitely one of my favorite books.  This book is addicting and entertaining.  Ana has these two characters inside her, her subconscious (that is very snarky) and her inner goddess (that does back flips for Christian).  I LOVE THIS! It is so interesting to read about her thoughts this way.  The music is so great, you can literally play a soundtrack to follow the story.  I like that Christian and Ana have better communication via email, because I am the same way.  I might not be able to say something in person, but I can definitely put it in writing.  The sex scenes are some of the steamiest I have read, and they are beautifully written. It does not come off as trashy at all, which is semi-shocking, because it really could have gone this way.<br /><br />VERDICT<br /><br /> If you are over 18, get it, read it, love it! I don't think anyone could start this book, and voluntarily stop reading it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  See more of my reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com
B005LAIH2W|1.0|I can't believe I blew $20.00 on this dvd.  The only good thing about the film is the blob with 6 legs that acts like a dog.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The plot has some interesting turns. I found I enjoyed it more by writing down the characters as I went along because there are so many characters introduced early that play a significant part later. With the Danish names it was a little more difficult to remember them.  SInce reading this book , Ive read others by the same author which were good also.
B004OC07GM|5.0|Very good book, excellent for that entrepreneur that you has inside. The dilemma of the do or not to do
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I thought it would be a light hearted treatment of a serious issue, particularly in light of the humour evident from the first page onwards. I didn't expect the  sucker punch it delivered however.  It affected me much more than I expected and stayed with me for days afterwards. The last book that affected me this way was The Lonely Bones. My first book by this author and someone I'll now seek out for her other books. I would highly recommend this book.

B005LAIHKY|4.0|Poor old Tim Burton had to deal with two of the most difficult problems a movie-maker faces when putting together a film.<br /><br />First, he was making a movie loosely based on an old TV series. Predictably, the reviews of many people focus on the fact that the movie is not like the TV series. People do love their memories and to see the characters and atmosphere changed from what they remember causes them anguish and leads to endless comments in which the words 'in the tv series', 'in the original Dark Shadows' or even 'in the real Dark Shadows' feature prominently.<br /><br />Second, he was making a comedy for the big screen. In order to get people to come to see it in theaters, it's necessary to show trailers and the trailers for a comedy have to be funny. The movie-maker is therefore forced to choose between screening some of the best jokes in the trailers in order to attract an audience and having the jokes fall flat in the film because people have already seen them or not showing the best stuff in the trailers and risking a flop because no-one thinks the film is funny enough to want to come and see it.<br /><br />Personally, I never saw Dark Shadows when it was a soap opera, so I had no preconceptions of what the movie 'should' contain. In that sense, I'm the ideal audience for Burton, but unfortunately for him, many people did come and see the movie hoping for a continuation of the program they recalled. However, I did see the trailers and sure enough, seeing the same jokes in the film wasn't nearly as funny as it would have been had I never seen them before. Perhaps one day an adventurous movie-maker will produce a trailer which has a completely different set of jokes in it and sell it on the basis that the film is even funnier- but then people would probably be disappointed that a joke in the trailer wasn't in the movie!<br /><br />I thought this was an entertaining film, based on Johnny Depp's wonderful ability to convey thoughts and emotions through subtle (yes, even in this film) changes of facial expression and tone of voice. The supporting cast was excellent, there was lots of action and the sets and special effects were, as always in Tim Burton movies, outstanding. It's not a film I'd watch over and over, but it certainly wasn't a disappointment. Try and watch it without comparing it with the TV series and you might find you enjoy it on its own terms.
0345803485|1.0|It's no secret that this novel was originally a (very poorly written) Twilight Fanfiction, and it definitely shows. The sex scenes are laughable and embarrassing mainly in how they're written; nothing about them is arousing or even clever, and it sounds as if it's by a 14 year old picking up a pen for the first time. The sparse writing between orgasms is juvenile at best, and if I had a quarter for every ellipse, well, I'd be making as much money as this pitiful series. I read a few choice pages online just to see what everyone was raving about and snorted. Someone should tell James that \\"less is more\\".
B00013RC8O|5.0|After hearing about the 'White Dodge Challenger' from a friend with regard to this movie, I just had to own it.  Not only do I have this original version of the movie, I learned that there was a remake using current events of the time of the remake starring Viggio Mortenson, so I pre-ordered that DVD prior to release date and I am looking forward to receiving that movie!  Great Customer Service, Great Condition of Product!  Thank you!
B0071XO8RA|2.0|after reading the negative reviews of this book, I am scared of the backlash of the 5 star reviewers out there, but one's review is merely an opinion<br />so I will give this book an average rating, of 2.5 stars.<br />*this is just my opinion and shouldn't reflect the millions of 5 stars it has received but judge for yourself and read it*<br /><br />My mom loved this book and she usually never fails me, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />I read it in about a 24 hour period.  Normally, a book this size takes me about 5-6 hours to read,<br />but I felt myself staring at the same page for several minutes more that I usually do... which is a bad sign in my case.<br />One sentence, in the first couple pages, was a complete (detailed) paragraph, and I think I read it a few times before I realized I was re-reading the same sentence.<br /><br />The story kept losing me and I don't know why...<br /><br />It started to pick up pace once the author introduced Jules (towards the end of book two). I really liked her, a strong older heroine, but he didn't go into her enough and I found myself wanting more details about her.  I wanted to know who she was and what made her 'tick', but it just wasn't there.. and that was disappointing.  It was almost like I found myself not really caring what happened to her, and maybe it's because she was weak as a sherif and I felt she gave up when she was arrested.<br /><br />Books 1-3 were the slowest for me, too detailed in the most unimportant things and I felt myself getting frustrated because I really wanted to love this book and I kept asking myself, why is the author telling us this??? it's not necessary.. but it picked up pace after book 3 and I found myself done with books 4 and 5 in just a short while. (there were some loose ends in that frustrated me as well, but perhaps he will fix this as the story progresses)..<br /><br />Overall, I think he is a talented author and I think he is going to go far based on the number of people who loved this book.  And if it became a movie, I probably would go watch it.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is awsome. so much fun. hope there r more games like this amazing one. could make the prices on the game lower
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use it for simple things like balancing my checkbook.  Easy to use, a must have for those of us who don't do math in our heads.
B000002VMD|5.0|Your fast turnaround in getting it to the destination made all the difference as the song, \\"I Will Always Love You\\" was played at my Grandfather's funeral dedicated to him from myself - who lives 3,000 miles away - and my Cousin - who lives 10 minutes away and was able to be certain that the song was played last at the end of his services as we had a very special bond with our Grandfather.  Thank you so much for making that possible by shipping it so fast.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I've not read any other reviews, so this one is based on my experience alone. Overall it is pretty easy to use. My only complaint is the last piece of the puzzle usually locks up and you have to work pretty hard to get it to move. Kindle fire

B007OWG3LM|5.0|Wow I am loving this! Personally, I was NOT a fan of the last Sigur Ros, I didn't think they made a particularly good 'pop' group. This is a stunning return to form, and i'm delighted that they have gone back to the sound that makes them one of the most unique bands in the world. What I love most about this band is that it's almost impossible to review, it's just so stunning and gorgeous that all one can really say is: listen!<br /><br />Thank you Sigur Ros for another masterpiece...
0767020308|3.0|Am I the only one who found the garden scene a bit icky? Yes, we all know that Emma is 16 years Mr. Knightley's junior, and he has known her since she was a child. However, when revealing his love for Emma, Mr. Knightley says he held her in his arms when she was a baby and Emma replies, \\"I hope you like me better now\\" my reaction was EWWW!!!<br /><br />Meanwhile back at the review... I recently had something of an Emma marathon. This version of Emma tries to be fairly faithful to Jane Austen's novel, but then they tried to fit it all into a movie that's not quite 2 hours. You either need to cut some of the subplots, like the Gwyneth Paltrow adaptation, or you need to allot more time, like the 1972 or 2009 BBC adaptations. This movie felt very rushed to me, and the two scenes that suffered the most are the two that make or break an adaptation of Emma for me.<br /><br />The first scene is the ball. In this version everything felt rushed, the dance, Mr. Knightley's rescue of Harriet from embarrassment, and Emma's thank you to Mr. Knightley all seemed to take place at break-neck speed. The second is the aforementioned garden scene. Besides having the previously mentioned cringe-inducing exchange, the whole thing takes place so quickly. Mr. Knightley rushes, practically runs, out of the house to see Emma and says his lines so fast I was starting to wonder if the scene was being directed with a stopwatch (OK, take 3 let's see if we can shave another 15 seconds off the scene this time...).<br /><br />It really is a shame that things had to be so rushed, because there was a very good cast and the production values were top notch. The biggest problem here is that Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley just didn't work. He seemed to play the character more like Mr. Darcy, than Mr. Knightley. Also, there just wasn't any chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong, and I think it ended up hurting my perception of Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Emma.<br /><br />The costumes, the props, the locations and sets were all fantastic, and I enjoyed a number of the performances. I think that Samantha Morton is possibly my favorite Harriet Smith. However, in this type of movie everything hangs on the chemistry of the leads, and it just isn't there.<br /><br />So unfortunately, I can't highly recommend this movie. If it's your first time to see this story, I would recommend either the superb 2009 BBC mini series starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller, or the charming theatrical release starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam instead of this adaptation. If you've already seen those two versions, you might find it interesting to watch this for comparison.

B005EVVPUE|5.0|What can I say? This DVD spoils you! Forget the 2003 edition. This is the one you want! It includes both concerts Friday/Saturday plus some neat special features. The picture is also clear and crisp unlike the videos you see floating around on Youtube. Do yourself a favor and buy it or as Fred always liked to say \\"Get on with it!\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been playing this game on my son's IPod for months now just waiting for Kindle Fire to get it. Finally got it and it was well worth the wait! Much nicer on the bigger screen too!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the iOS version, and this port has satisfied my longing for this amazing game. The graphics aren't blurry or fuzzy just because its a big screen, Its perfect! Love it. I rate it 5 demon monkeys, out of 5.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun I love it. I can never put my kendle fire down. the best part is that its free. this game is so good you will stay up all night trying to beat your bight score!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I've been listening to an Uk version of this Album since Feb.Finally released in the US. An excellent album that should be a big hit.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Don't be turned off by the generic title.  Despite knowing that the hero is headed nowhere pleasant (which is usually a deal-killer for me when I want to escape into a fantasy novel), I was absolutely obsessed with this book while reading it.<br /><br />Really well-written, and exceptionally well plotted.  It's so well-done that the more-than-perfect hero somehow rises above his perfection and is compelling, engaging and very sympathetic.  Captures your interest from the get-go, and doesn't let up.  Somehow the author incorporates lots of exposition seamlessly into a lot of action.  (Because the narrative starts during the hero's childhood, the reader learns about the \\"world\\" alongside the hero--nicely done...)<br /><br />I can't wait for the next installation!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best ever......i cant stop playing it...it is soooooooooooo additcting....... if u dont get this uor crazy :) @----'----,------
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a great book.  It was hard to put the book down.  All I wanted to do was get to the end so I could start the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. Ive been waiting for it to come out on the kindle fire. Its so much fun.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The Box Office Ticket sales don't reflect the superb quality of this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope that DISNEY does some other Edgar Rice Burroughs NOVELS. They hit a home run this time. It probably will take a while for DVD sales to make up for the poor BOX OFFICE performance!<br /><br />UPDATE 08-23-2012<br />I just finished watching \\"PRINCESS OF MARS\\" produced in 2009 starring TRACI LORDS. Many of the reviews of Edgar Rice Burroughs's \\"JOHN CARTER\\" were actually based on this mediocre 2009 version!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a awesome game you should try it so if you like ice age you will so love this game
0446572993|5.0|I have had the opportunity to have read many of Mr. Baldacci's books, most of them I liked, a few I didn't.  I have always enjoyed his characters and his plot construction.  However, in my opinion THE INNOCENT is perhaps his best book and most enjoyable.  His character, the young girl, adds greatly to the book.  Further his plotting is excellent and makes it difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />Fred Brogger
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun I enjoy dis game very much... ADDICTIED! ! recommend to people definitely its challenging but very simple and makes you want to play more
B00646YRW6|5.0|This is my favorite series. Each new season is an improvement over the last! The special effects seem to improve with each episode as do the character changes.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game. Challenging with lot of puzzles to keep you busy for a while. All different levels of difficulty. 5 stars.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this puzzle!  I play it every day.  I've played it before on paper but I love it on my Kindle more.  If I make a mistake, I just reset and start over.  No messy erasing.  I agree with some reviewers about the small squares and sometimes my fat fingers hit the wrong one, but the undo works nicely.  All in all, a great little puzzle game.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I like this Twitter app, but would it be possible if you could make instagram for Kindle fire or maybe more good photo editing apps:]? That would be really nice.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so my favorite game. Basically, you run away from &quot;evil demon&quot; monkeys and try to gather coins as you go. The game gives you the option of getting more coins using real money, but it doesn't pester you to do so. You can use the coins to buy power ups, characters, or wallpaper for your phone. I like it and so will tweens like me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic read, can't recommend enough!! Read the complete trilogy in less than two weeks, could not put down!! Just brill

0553826166|4.0|There must be heaps of reviews on this.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who like good story telling and can handle some spectacular violence..<br /><br />The front pages of the book lists Jack Reacher's vital statistics and general cv, which I liked. This book was originally published in 1997 and some of the technical details feel dated now, but are just fine considered in their time frame.<br /><br />I very nearly used the book to put a dint in my wall when a coincidence turned up, early on, that hit new levels of improbability but something kept me reading.<br /><br />I honestly don't know if I want to meet Jack Reacher.<br /><br />His world is violent and unsettling and he defies all attempts to claim his time and identity. He tries to walk away from everything but stumbles into messes, saves all manner of stricken folks and then he leaves. No one knows him except for the grateful, a baffled police force and their clean up crews. He's like Jessica Fletcher from \\"Murder She Wrote.\\" Folks around him are going to die heinously: the difference is she sleuths her way through things baking muffins and enjoying her tight small town relationships, Jack Reacher mows his way through his immediate problems mostly alone and then leaves alone.<br /><br />His years as an army military cop have taught him to think very sneakily. He's baffled by normal things, good at difficult things and he has no idea how to belong beyond the intimacy possible when just passing through.<br /><br />This is the writer's biggest hook for me. I've known military brats and the constant moving pushes most of them into giving up on people. They don't make friends easily and don't trust things when they do. Moving away when the going gets tough is second nature and they can leave a chain of pain behind them that would surprise and confuse them if they found out about it. Just like Jack.<br /><br />Like I said, not a good person to know.<br /><br />A great person to read about though.<br /><br />Lee's writing stays out of my way and lets the story unfold oh so easily.<br /><br />I cringed at the carnage, marvelled at the fiendishness of the villain's grand master plan and couldn't put it down until the last page.<br /><br />And I had fun after I got my heart restarted in a couple of places, when all is said and done.<br /><br />4.5 stars with half a star being removed for that annoying coincidence and because Jack is the poster boy of how far some blokes will go to avoid washing their own clothes. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />PS. I bought this book from a local book shop and will be rereading it.r />Lee's writing stays out of my way and lets the story unfold oh so easily.<br /><br />I cringed at the carnage, marvelled at the fiendishness of the villain's grand master plan and couldn't put it down until the last page.<br /><br />And I had fun after I got my heart restarted in a couple of places, when all is said and done.<br /><br />4.5 stars with half a star being removed for that annoying coincidence and because Jack is the poster boy of how far some blokes will go to avoid washing their own clothes.

B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoyed this game. Its fun and thrilling to play with s dash of suspense. Its one of my new fav games and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome trust me u will love it. it will blow your mind. if you like running jumping or touching your screen like me u will love this game.
1576754227|5.0|Eat that Frog, very clear to the point. A well written look at how to stop procrastinating and get priorities in order. Author claims to have researched and practiced methodology of book, and dose not disappoint reader with insightful information. Highly recommended.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Other reviews say its good but not worth a folklore and honestly,  I wouldn't pay that much, but as the free app of the day you cant go wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game to play in your free time.You can level up your character while buying power ups.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this ap.  Well made and easy to use and play. Definite download a must.  Great way to relax while waiting for whatever needs waiting for in life.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|Always a fan of Virginia Woolf, I loved the way Michael Cunningham interwove the historical Woolf and the book she was writing, Mrs. Dalloway, with a modern-day Mrs. Dalloway character, and an unhappy housewife in the 1950's who is reading Mrs. Dalloway. They are all meeting suicide head on in the book, although from different vantage points. I won't give away their connection, which is resolved so beautifully and passionately at the end of the book. I leave it for you, the reader, to be astounded by, moved by, fascinated by.<br />Becca Chopra, author of The Chakra Diaries
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once I got done with the 2nd book in the trilogy I couln't wait to pick up the last one. I loved it! This was another one I couldn't put down! When I got done reading the book it left me wondering if there was going to be another book. Or if the author was going to write 3 books on Christians point of view like at the end of the 3rd. That would be awesome!!! I would definately read those. I am curious what was always going on with Christian every time he got up every time he worried about ana. Every time he played the piano in the middle of the night. The book definately left me wanting more!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|ever since I started this game I could. to put it down.  its a lot of fun to try to reach the objectives best game on kindle fire so far.
B002L4QP0M|1.0|Did not care for the book.  I like the concept of all the different people/background/nations looking for the same item and much of the chase was interesting (not very realistic, but interesting), but the book never \\"all came together\\" at the end.  You were left with unanswered questions and it left you frustrated after trying so hard to keep it all straight throughout the book.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Life is too short to read rubbish like this,don't waste your time! It has to be one of the most badly written pieces ever. The constant repetition of phrases was mind numbing. The author should invest in a thesaurus.Do not buy this if you fancy a good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had my reserves about this book but so many people I know were reading it and I herd such great things about it, that I had to give it a shot. I admit I was shocked about parts of the novel and about some of the sex scenes but I couldn't put the book down. I loved every bit of it. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, to Ana, to Christian, to their romance. The book made me blush, laugh, cry, and smile the whole time I read it. There were a couple lines in the book that after I read them I put the book down because I couldnt believe it was said. LOL.. But it still made me smile. This book though I know how it originated, and wasnt at all interested in Twilight, was one of the best books I had read in a long time. Definately well put together!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is one of the better weather apps I've used...... I would like a better radar screen... but would recommend this to a friend
B0086700CM|5.0|I ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT! It is so cool to finally have temple run on the Kindle Fire! It is one of my favorite gamed on my IPhone... so now I can play it on my kindle!!,
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is pretty much the best out there. tried on my kindle and it give very smooth and reliable connection
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Left me wanting more! It took me less then a day to read this book beause it was a can't put down novel!
B0086700CM|5.0|best time waster on the app store. good controls and graphics.  a little repetitious but better than all the pay to play apps out there.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Game is OK but nothing special, the in game purchases though are a joke. There are much better games out there so I would not recommend this game to others.
B006RUJST6|2.0|This book does not deserve all these 5 star reviews. I almost stopped reading at the point when she ordered chocolate milk on the rocks at the slam club but I decided to continue because of all the great reviews. Now, with a quarter of the book left to read I find myself again wanting to stop. I'm at a scene where she (Lake) turns into a total insensitive, immature idiot while Will, her teacher, has to go into painful detail about how his parents died just to prove to her and her annoying friend that if anyone finds out Lake slept in his bed it could ruin his life. I'd like to think when I was her age that I wouldn't have to spoken to like a child just to understand the gravity of a situation. It's just frustrating to read and even more frustrating reading all these AMAZING reviews about a book that really isn't that good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was breathtaking for me! I couln't put it down! It left me wondering what was going to happen next!
B007H9B8FS|3.0|This album represents two of my pet peeves with album releases these days.<br /><br />1. It's too long: In the Vinyl days we typically got 40-45 minutes, which meant the best stuff got on the album and the lesser stuff was B-sides. Nowadays too many bands go hog wild filling up the CD. At 65 minutes or so this is about 20 minutes too long, too much filler. Being more selective means more quality, less quantity. With many bands releasing CDs for around 9.99 a 40-45 minute version of this (much of which is by-the-numbers Garbage) would have easily been a 4-star album and a much better value buy.<br /><br />2. Too loud. Borderline loudness war victim. Pandering to the cloth-eared mp3 listener who doesn't have a decent stereo system and can't be bothered using the volume knob.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game!  It's never the same twice. The whole family can play at the same time, 45 to 6: young adults, teens and preteens in between.  Easy to play.  The official web site has an initial play tutorial video that was very helpful, although the written directions are very clear.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|Imho this was an awesome movie and scared me half to death lol I'm ordering this movie right now. It's a must see
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am torn with this novel. I love the book but am so torn about the ending and the last few chapters leading up to it. I wasnt expecting a fairytail ending but I wasnt expecting Katniss to end up like she did. I could see Coin being another bad president for the capital if she was given the chance, although,<br />I wasn't to sure who Katniss should trust and who she shouldnt when she went into the capital.<br /><br />When District 13 was described it made me think of the capital and how much they had in common. Was it really a rebellion that wanted freedom, or was it a rebellion that wanted the capital their way? Am I the only one that thought this?<br /><br />The author brought out a lot in these books that is interesting. I have reccomended this book to several people and hope to read more from this author.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I read all of the Burroughs books as a kid.  They took me away from the miserable day to day world of elementary school of the 50s to better and more interesting worlds.  They inspired me to read about science on my own since what school provided was so light weight.  As an adult the books are dated.  However, I am now an avid sci fi  reader and still a science nerd.  I think this film will do for younger viewers what the books did for me; provide an entertaining and inspiring interlude.  Loved the settings, the costumes, and the story line.  I do not understand why this movie was poorly reviewed by the critics.  For me it was much better than the under scripted Conan and the dull Thor.  Give the film a change.  At least on streaming it is a bargain.
B005LAIGSC|3.0|I love a good CIA movie.  This was really trying to be a Jason Bourne movie, just did not make it.  Danzel gives a good performance, no surprise there.  To much cat and mouse running around.  Then inside murders start happening ?  This was a rental at best, glad that is what we did.  Not a terrible movie, but not a great one either.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Absence, the style is completely different than her first two albums and that's good.  Her first two albums had a bluesy, smoke-filled night club feel that everyone loves.  They feature the type of music you could listen to late at night but they were very \\"mainstream\\" jazz.  Every one loves her previous albums and so do I.  But there is more to jazz then sad songs of unrequited love.  Absence, explores a \\"happier\\" jazz (if you will).  The songs are lighter and more upbeat with latin and Brazilian jazz overtones.  It is not the same old thing.  I am sure Melody could have recorded more mainstream material and we would all go out and buy it and it would be fine - but it might also become tiresome.  This is new.  This is different. If you look back at all the truly successful musicians and singers you will find that they were unafraid to experiment.  Experimentation is a journey that allows performers to grow and mature; Melody is taking us along on that journey.  As of today this CD only costs $10, you can't go wrong.  Pop this in your CD player and take a drive during the day - a sunny day.  Listen to the CD a few times; it will grow on you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could't wait to see what happens next! Couldnt put it down!! Couldn't wait to read the next book!!! Definately loved it.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|any dev who makes a for pay app that requires additional payment inside the app gets no purchase and a one star vote for their app. Mainly because their extra money typically goes to paying for bogus good reviews as you see on this app.
B007MDB71O|2.0|We really did nit dig this movie to much.  The story just never got off the ground.  I felt like I was watching a Star Wars spin off with Conan tossed it.  The special effects were good, that was the only plus to this movie.  Very long a drawn out.  Rent it only, save your money.
B0064SHI9I|4.0|If you have a rooted device, this will do everything you need and then some. You can choose to backup only what you want, or everything, and schedule it. They also give you a small amount of on-line space to store your encrypted backup. Local backups go to a location you choose, which you can then transfer to your computer. Until I need to do a restore it's hard to say more, but as far as I've gone everything has been as expected.<br />The toolbox allows you to manage start-up programs (I still miss WinPatrol, but this will do in the meantime), freeze unnecessary things (like the dialer if you have a pad) and can clean the caches of programs you select.<br />I've been quite happy with it. I've used both this and Titanium, and I prefer this. All those extra tools save you having to install extra apps. I do wish the online storage was a bit more generous, as there isn't much room for data as-is. Of course, more is available for an additional charge.<br />They even have a manual! When's the last time an android app had one of those available?
B00008LDPU|4.0|If you are a Matrix fan, this 9 short films are for you.<br /><br />Four of the nine episodes were written by Larry and Andy Wachowski, and all of the episodes are grounded in the world of the The Matrix.<br /><br />Genres: action, drama, psychological, science fiction, supernatural<br />Themes: cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, robots, war
1469984202|5.0|These books are great! I could not put my kindle  down for 2 days straight. This is the first time I felt compelled to leave a review-they were that good.  And a bargain! You can't go wrong.  They were brilliant! I kept worrying about the characters when I wasn't reading. Save some Money & buy the first 5 at once, you will for sure be getting the series!
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I love the basic point of this game, and the graphics are mind-blowing. However I do not like a few things about the game.<br /><br />A. Slow-mo cancels music, but the music is one of the awesome parts of the game.<br /><br />B. You only get ten Slow-mo power-ups when you download the game - after using them all you need to either buy more (real $) or manually clear game data in system settings (settings &gt; more &gt; applications &gt; gravity guy &gt; clear data).<br /><br />Although the slow-mo could use some work, I find this game very entertaining and fun. 4/5 (9/10 if it let us do scale of 10.)<br /><br />Pros - very fun and exciting fast-paced scrolling game with a twist and great graphics<br /><br />Cons - slow-mo could use some work
B0071MV540|4.0|I remembered seeing the previews for this movie on TV & thinking that it was nothing special, nothing \\"new\\"!  So, when my teenage son picked it for family night I wasn't very excited.  However, I am quite pleased to say that I was wrong.  Though not the funniest movie I have seen it was still a very \\"fun\\" all around movie.  Though most of this movie is obviously an attempt at humor as you would expect just by looking at the cast, there are a fair share of dramatic moments.  The dramatic parts of this movie set up the comedic parts.  All in all I feel this film does a great job of walking us through many different emotions.  We get to be happy, sad, excited and, in the end, we can feel content that the \\"BAD GUY\\" gets what he deserves!  Great movie, great fun!  I do have one word of caution, the movie is rated PG-13 and that shouldn't be ignored.  While there is no nudity or sex there is a great deal of, \\"situational\\" language you should be aware of, otherwise, relax and enjoy!
B0000A36J5|5.0|Excellent for collectors and enthusiasts.<br /><br />Beatifull package.<br /><br />A lot of great scenes, what you never seen in the theatrical version.<br /><br />The Collectible polystone sculpture of Gollum in The Forbidden Pool is very good, very detailed and durable. And the companion piece showing how Gollum evolved from pencil sketch to digital character, is a nice piece for digital artists.
B007V80WUC|5.0|Like another reviewers has said\\" It takes a few listens\\" to absorb all of this album, I really enjoyed the 1st 2 albums from this band, and was really excited about the 3rd one coming out this year, yes this album has a a little more Refined feel to it, but it's still Circus Maximus, First of all the Guitar riffing is pretty heavy ( Meaning tuning is lowered on the guitar ). but all the great melodies are still there and Michael's vocals are superb as usual, my only complaint I feel in some spots on the album Mikes vocals seem a little lower than others. now on with the album review:<br />It opens with \\"Forging: A spacey sounding Instrumental intro<br />then it kicks right into\\" Architect Of Fortune\\" a ten minute journey of Progressive Bliss! One of my faves!<br />Then we come to \\"Namaste\\" a very cool and heavy song, some great guitar riffing on this one.<br />\\"Game of Life\\" is to me a little bit more on the melodic Metal side, but still a very good song.<br />\\"Reach Within\\" is the single from this album , not a bad song, just my least favorite on the album.<br />\\"I Am\\" has a uplifting feel to it  some nice Keyboard work on this one, and soaring melodies. I also love the Guitar/Key soloing toward the end of the song<br />\\"USED: is my personal favorite..Kicks right into high gear from the start, excellent guitars and drums on this song..a \\"driving\\" song so dont speed!!<br />\\"The One\\" is another song that could be on a melodic rock/Metal album, but having progressive elements to it, great work by Michael on the vocals again.<br />\\"Burn After Reading\\" is another 10 minute journey of prog bliss starting of with nice acoustic guitar and Mikes awesome voice,,then kicks into the Heavy riffing, slows down then kicks again into \\"Thrashy\\" riffing..excellent!<br /><br />\\"The Last Goodbye\\"<br />Well it starts off with some keys and acoustic guitar and then the electric guitar riffs, real happy uptempo at first, then it just slams you and slows down to a halt!<br />with some beautiful Synth keys and Mike singing soulfully. it's another 10 minute journey of ups and downs \\"Classic Maximus\\"<br /><br />Some people maybe looking towards another \\"Isolate or Glory\\", but this album stands on it's own. It has a  combo of Rock/Metal/Prog/Pop etc very eclectic.<br />One of the best of the year so far!!utiful Synth keys and Mike singing soulfully. it's another 10 minute journey of ups and downs \\"Classic Maximus\\"<br /><br />Some people maybe looking towards another \\"Isolate or Glory\\", but this album stands on it's own.

B0086700CM|1.0|I bout this game and makes me buy things that I don't want.Don't get it! If you do you will regret it!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|its a great game for kids but not a game that a three year old would get to play and understand the concept of the game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An amazing series that has a story line far beyond the one discussed in the media of a dominant sexual relationship. The writing style is excellent with a smooth flow and just the right amount of detail. For those who have not read the series due the controversy in the media, try it!
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought this was a fun game getts hard around 300,000 bit over all fun sometimes didn't responed to finger movement
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Don't let the ratings fool u. The devs put in fake 5 star reviews. It should be around 2 stars.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|nice and entwining reminding me very much of super Mario game back in the days.my kid loves it and doesn't stop playing.
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|Has anyone else noticed a trend in the app developing world where all the devs are including in app purchases? What kind of shzz is this where you pay for an app and then have to pay even more money for all the features? Like one reviewer said, when you buy a paid app, you are paying for the full package.<br />There are times when in app purchases are ok. The most prominent example is Temple Run. Imangi studios creates a great game and then they offer it for free! Their in app purchases don't interfere with game play at all. Everything in the game can be unlocked without paying money, albiet a little slower.<br />As consumers, it is our job to to check game developers. Instead of letting them shove their stuff down our throats, we can reject their games or give their games low ratings.<br />The game itself is not that bad. The graphics are fluid and gameplay is fun. It has been a while since I have played a flip running game. This game deserves 5 stars but the dev killed it with poor implementation :-(
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this app and my friends alleys beg me to let them play it. Its really fun with no problems like loading or quality. Completely recommend this app!!!!
B0087DFIOU|5.0|Now THIS is how you make a proper action-thriller! \\"Get the Gringo\\" is one hell of a film; a stripped-down, gritty actioner reminiscent of the kind of dark, no-nonsense thrillers we saw back in the '70s and '80s. With so many glossy, CGI-laden blockbusters hitting screens these days, it's invigorating to see Mel Gibson - who grows more badass with each passing year - doing what he does best in his first true action-thriller since 1998's \\"Payback\\". Gibson may be controversial, but those who are open-minded enough to watch \\"Get the Gringo\\" will be rewarded with a visceral, lively motion picture featuring Gibson back at the top of his game.
B003LPNGWA|5.0|Bancroft and Hopkins are superb in this most entertaining movie. One to be watched over and over again. The fact that it is based on real characters makes it all the better.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I have a Samsung Dart and the \\"Compatible\\" sign showed up for this game. Unfortunately, after having bought, downloaded, and installed it, I could never get past the home \\"loading\\" screen. Clearly, I've been misled. The product is either incompatible or a dud. Very disappointed. I heard this is a great game. Can't say anything now...

0385474547|5.0|I have seen this book many times in airport bookstores and I realized it must be very popular. After reading it, I realized it is a masterpiece. Achebe writes the tale of a tribe and carries the reader through their many ceremonies and celebrations. He explains the values of the people through their negotiation for a bride price or the killing of a captive from a competing tribe. We see how the tribe establishes social relationships and how those relationships contribute to survival. Achebe tells the story of Okonkwo, a man of impulse and personal strength, a brave man who fears not acting as a man. This Nigerian Ibo everyman is all too human, making mistakes with his children, with his three wives, with his in-laws, with his relatives, and eventually with the colonial powers that invade the land. Achebe is able to show the religious and spiritual beliefs of the people that are fully integrated into their lives and actions. Their spiritual beliefs are linked to taboo objects, actions, and places. This may seem superstitious but we see how this constantly reminds and reinforces the spiritual beliefs of the people.  The book is full of humor but also personal tragedy. The writing style of Achebe is straightforward, understated and yet subtle. His direct writing style is clear and yet he is able to shade meaning and intention.  I must admit that it is one of the best books I have read this year and I strongly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so great. mad I don't know why yours did that but I have update my 3 times and my points and my games did not start over
B005LY4B0A|3.0|I love the game... It gets passed around on my fire like crazy in my house. Enjoyable and entertaining! It has been the source of good natured ribbing and flat out frustration. Great concept for a puzzle game. However,  there are quite a few bugs in the software... Nothing that hinders gameplay so far but they are noticeable.... As someone mentioned earlier the hints are hard-ish to follow (you tube is better) and a back/undo button would be heavenly.@
B000Y0OCEQ|5.0|Gotta say that this was one of the best episodes that I've seen thus far.<br />My only gripe was the special effects that were to be the rendering of<br />two 1,000 Megaton A-Bombs. The largest detonated on earth was<br />around 50 megatons. Technology or not, it looked like earth shot a<br />ciggerette butt at em.
0743243153|1.0|This book missleading in the title and from the beggining. This book has destroyed my marriage by being a tool of decieption. I recommend that if your a Christain and you beleive in God do not buy this book. This book is about convincing you that there is no God. This is not about spiritually growing as you would think. My wife bought into the beleifs in this book and had an affair because of it. Now she feels guilty and is suicidal. she is afraid that she may have contacted an STD. Now I am picking up the peices by showing my wife what real love is by forgiving her and leting God's love heal her. This book has some good but, just enough to decieve you. Run from this book!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed very much reading the first two books of this trilogy. I can't wait to read the third book. Now my husband is enjoying reading the first book!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Another game where you keep paying to play the game you already paid for.  As usual, it is designed to be not quite winable without forking up more funds.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it every day who doesn't like this game but why do monkey's have to chase the guy
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I went through about 5 different rss readers and finally came back to this one.  It is better than any others I tried, hands down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I looked forward to seeing the victors come back home and receive their prizes, but it did not end up like I had imagined!  I  just bought the third book to see how it all plays out!
B004XQO90O|5.0|BEWARE:  CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br />While I did enjoy this movie, there were a few plot holes that sort of got to me.<br /><br />First, the train bomb looked to weigh 200 pounds or more.  Question:  how was the terrorist able to not only haul it onto the train, but to hoist it up and place it above the ceiling tiles in the washroom, without the entire ceiling collapsing?<br /><br />Second, who was the terrorist?  Oh, yes, the proto-typical, politically correct, loser white guy.  And the motive?  Well, he just didn't like society, so he wanted to destroy the world.  (Give him credit, though, he was able to construct a dirty bomb in his proto-typical, politically correct, loser van.)<br /><br />Third, time travel.  So the Source Code's side effect is that it acts like a time machine, and re-winds the entire Universe back to the moment when . . . uh . . . when--well, whatever.<br /><br />Finally, instead of going for the obligatory happy ending, it might have been better if the hero goes back for the last time and kisses the girl as the train is destroyed for the final time.  Instead, what happens?  When the hero goes back for the final time, he basically steals the body, life, and girlfirend of the train passenger who, remember, is no longer dead.  What happened to the train passenger's consciousness?  Perhaps they will make a sequel dealing with his predicament!
B003MC5N28|5.0|(Rant)I recall the first time I read this book. The year was 2001 and it was my sixth grade reading assignment. I remember reading the books description and just knowing I would hate it. The reason I can remember this book so clearly is because this was the year I learned about life. Through the events of September 11th and this book .This was the year I learned the world wasn't perfect, that bad things do happen. (Rant finished)<br /><br />\\"The giver\\" offers the reader a lot to consider, and digest. What seems like a perfect community slowly morphs into a nightmare. It is a unique and fascinating read that leaves you questioning all aspects of society today, and life. I think the book has an underlying message about history and how not to forget the past, and to learn from mistakes.<br /> I don't know if they still read this in schools, but I would highly recommend it. It would be a great novel to have discussions about.<br /><br />I'm now 22, a senior in college, and I still read this book every couple of years. It never gets old, if anything I understand something new everytime.<br />Over the years I have read hundreds of books, yet I still think this was the book that changed my mid about reading.<br /><br />Characters: 5/5<br />Writing/error: 5/5<br />Plot: 5/5<br />Ending: 5/5
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I love this game, offers a quick and fun distraction throughout the day.  Well worth the money! It's like Bejewelled brought to a whole new level.  I love it!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|very addictive good game for the entire family not hard to play my five year old loves it my children fight over who gets to play first
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The audio and video quality is outstanding. Even if you have seen the show on TV, buy this set because if you really like the show then you will appreciate the special features. The extras explained the history of westeros which was very helpful to me since I didn't read the books.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I love this show!  The whole cast is amazing and have such great chemistry.  Season 1 is just the beginning!  It starts to delve into the family dynamic and gets into a lot of funny situations and touching family drama and always keeps you laughing.  If you love to laugh, check out this show.  It's a good one!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Another OK game bites the dust because of excessive In-app Purchases and no option to turn OpenFeint off. I agree it is free today, But come tomorrow when people needs to pay 99c for this game will have to live with Openfeint and expensive in-app purchases.<br /><br />Miniclip does make good entertaining games. It does provide you with hours of fun and graphics is really smooth on Kindle fire. I had purchased [[ASIN:B007TLOYZU Fragger]] and enjoyed the game just like this Gravity Guy game offering from developer namely miniclip. But, honestly I hate the fact that the games have OpenFeint enabled in them.<br /><br />I can understand if the game is free and has tons of ads and dreaded OpenFeint enabled for data mining in the pretext of having global high scores and leader-board blah blah. But why do you really need to impose this on paid users? It does not seem justified.<br /><br />If the developer gives option to disable 'openfeint' during install I will rate this game at 3 stars [It is okay] at best otherwise as it stands it gets 1 star (I hate it) rating.
0439023491|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy closely follows the events of the first book with Katniss and Peeta back in District 12, now living in relative comfort. Katniss is uneasy and a visit from President prior to their victory tour adds to the discomfort. Revolt is brewing in the districts, and in order to protect those she loves, Katniss must do her best to convince the public of her undying love for Peeta while she still has deep feelings for Gale. Things do not go as planned and become even worse on the tour and are followed with the announcement for the special 75th Games that draws them back into the horror of the Games. While I was swept up in the increasing drama and fear that their situation has put them in, the teenage love angst did get a bit tedious from time to time. The intrigue of District 13 and the horrors of the system to those that Katniss cares for definitely drive the story forward to its cliffhanger ending. Overall it was an excellent sequel and I cannot imagine what surprises await in the third book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different games... you should be able to find something you like.  good for passing a little time while waiting somewhere.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Several hours of entertainment. This has replaced my previous favorite game to play. I'm very glad that I downloaded it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't want to get this game because everyone was obsessed and I didn't want to be, but to tell you the truth....I LOVE IT :D<br />You should definitely get it its very addicting and fun.<br />:)))))))))
0307949508|5.0|The second book in the Millenium series picks up with Lisbeth traveling to exotic locales. When she returns home, she decides to find a new apartment, and convinces her old friend and lover to take her old place. In the meantime, Mikael and the Millenium magazine have agreed to take on a major expose and book regarding the sex trade. When the two main authors are murdered and Lisbeth is implicated, Mikael must dig into her past and hope to exonerate her while she is on the run. We learn more about her horrific past which intrudes upon her present. This sequel plums much more into her emotional depths and helps fully develop her personna. I think I liked this one even more than the first, and the third book promises to conclude some of the loose ends.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This is terrific and is growing on me as great CDs do. I've been a fan since first seeing Bonnie, at the Whole Coffee House at the Univ. of Minnesota before her first album was recorded in Dave Ray's studio. This CD is among her best, in very select company.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am so glad I got the trilogy because when I finished one book I couldn't wait to start the next one!! Whew!!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I love this game and you can act like it is CSI and I just love it and this is for you fan.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Superb film about TRUE BLUE AMERICAN HEROES. Of course, the pond scum Liberal Elite in Hollywood will give it a pass, that is, UNLESS they can make money off these men's backs!
B000B8QG22|5.0|His preformance in this movie will make anyone laugh so hard they will hurt a rib or cry tears of laughter.  I enjoy this movie start to finish and there is no slow moments at all.  This is such a good movie you can't help but laugh and think you have to have this movie in your comedy collection.  It also has a few drama parts but overall a comedy start to finish.  What made me mainly buy the dvd was for the many one liners Williams does on the morning show he does for Vietnam.  As a side bar one of my favorite things Robin Williams does he his talent for doing mutiple voices and change his voice to do it.  So if your fan of the actor or looking for a good comedy movie to sit back and watch on a night have nothing else to do then pick this movie up and sit back and savor laugh after laugh.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|No.<br /><br />Just.<br /><br />No.<br /><br />I've read better porn online and much more realistic. This honestly reads like a smuttier, though no better written, version of what Twilight would be like without the sparkly faeries and werewolves. Unrealistic, boring, and straight out of a fourteen year olds mind. How did this get published? How is it a best seller?<br /><br />Just... NO.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is one of the funnest games. me and family play and try to beat each others high scores.
B001DJLCRC|1.0|The only reason I gave one star for this product is due to the advertised \\"closed captioning.\\"<br /><br />I enjoy this show immensely but didn't start watching it until season 4.  So I started with catchup by renting the DVDs on netflix, only to find out that there are no English subtitles for SDH.<br /><br />The DVDs are advertised as \\"closed-captioned\\"  but that has never worked with any DVD player I ever owned - I even tried it at a friend's house - he is a super geek and couldn't determine how these alleged closed captions were supposed to work.<br /><br />I finally broke down and paid the extra on Netflix for streaming the show on my PC, which thank God, does offer the subtitles in English.  But my computer's not the greatest, so either way, I'll be forking out additional $$$ for either a Blu-Ray or a new computer.
1595828753|4.0|The biggest surprise that I found about The Promise part 1 was how well it captured the spirit of the show so perfectly that it felt like a natural and seamless continuation of the series, which can also be said of Part II. However, even though I found it enjoyable and to be another well crafted story I do have some minor complaints about this one. The story is split between three different sections (Aang and Katara, Sokka and Toph, Ozai and Zuko). Each sections are well done and have moments I found quite enjoyable, but my biggest problem with this 2nd act int he series is that it felt to be somewhat like filler. As I have said these stories are interesting, well done, and expand upon the Avatar universe and background positively, but I felt that most of the Aang/Katara and Toph/Sokka sections didn't really have much to do with the major arc of this series, which is quite short to begin with. I wouldn't find that to be a problem if this was a longer series but there is only one volume left. I would have liked if more time was spent dealing or making progress with this major arc. I loved the stories but maybe they should have been saved for a \\"The Lost Adventures\\" type of comic or maybe a future series that has more time to build the universe and the characters. Having said that, I thought the author did a great job telling stories that were interesting and thoughtful. He captures the characters so perfectly and there was never a moment where I questioned whether or not a character would have said or done something different based upon what we know of them from the original series. Even though some of the jokes I found became somewhat repetitive I still chuckled multiple times and was grinning for most of the time I was reading this.  As a stand alone Avatar graphic novel I really enjoyed it.  I am eagerly awaiting Part III which has the potential to be quite epic. I definitely recommend reading this of course.
B0086700CM|5.0|The only problems with this is : 1) loss of sleep and 2) its a little laggy on kindle fire ( doesn't run as well as on ipods or ios.
B0086700CM|5.0|The best game ever!!!! it's difficult, it get's faster and faster. but I've got over 2 million points so far:):) I play it everyday. they need to make more games like it but with a different theme!! &quot; TEMPLE RUN ROCK'S.&quot;
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Excellent made game.  Good brain exercise.  Create pictures based on number of spaces allowed per line.  Very entertaining to discover what picture developes.  I was lucky enough to get this as the faotd a few days ago but worth the asking price.  Highly recommended for those who likes a little thought processing in their games.
1608193381|4.0|I was looking for an articulate depiction of the deep flaws of capitalism --- one that would convince some people that we need balance in our world system.  What I found was a very articulate work showing the imperfections of capitalism.  Perhaps there are no deep flaws in relation to alternative economic systems, but only in relation to competing religious and moral systems.<br />This book will appeal to people with above average intelligence and above average capacity for sympathy.  That describes most progressives (the few other progressives being selfish opportunists).<br />The author is very sharp and very honest.  This is a good read but will not change the world.
0345803485|1.0|I read the marketing blurbs as \\"exotic\\" instead of the actual \\"Erotic\\", so expected exotic romance, but instead it was about degradation, domination and pain.  Surely we women have come a long way away from enduring that stupidity.  Hopefully, I did continue on through Books 2 and Three.  No Thanks for this kind of a relationship.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and I know u will too!!!! I never get tired of this game!!! u have to buy it!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is such a phenomenal book series. \\"Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.\\" You have to read all three to understand it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|THOR is a visually stunning movie well worth seeing.  The lead actors--Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin--all perform admirably, though I do wish that the story had hewed rather more closely to the original vision of Jack Kirby, Thor's primary co-creator in the Marvel comics.<br /><br />Now I think most readers of this review will be surprised and confused to hear that Jack Kirby was the primary co-creator of Marvel's Thor, and not Stan Lee.  Indeed I love the dialogue and captioning that Mr. Lee wrote, but Stan's own words show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator not only of Thor but also of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including the THOR film and THE AVENGERS.<br /><br />Here's what Stan Lee said when asked to talk about Jack Kirby:<br /><br />\\"BOB [Brodsky, interviewer]: Jack Kirby?<br /><br />\\"STAN: When you talk about Kirby you really run out of superlatives. Jack was a writer as well as an artist (as many of the legends were). He was incredibly imaginative and he did his most important writing with his drawing. When I say that I mean if I gave Jack a very brief idea of what I wanted for a story, he would run with it.<br /><br />\\"I could say 'Jack in this next story, I think I'd like to have Dr. Doom kidnap Sue Storm and bring her to Liberia [obviously Stan meant Latveria], then the Fantastic Four have to go after her and in the end Dr. Doom may promise that he won't hurt Sue if they do something, and Reed says OK I agree, and the Thing would say how can you trust him, and Reed would say despite all of his faults Doom is a man of honor, he would never lie.'<br /><br />\\"I would discuss the idea with Jack like that and that was all I had to do. And then Jack would go home and he would draw the story and he would add a million elements that I hadn't told him about, so he was really writing in pictures and dreaming up ideas along the way.<br /><br />\\"And then when I did write the copy (the words, the dialogue and the captions) it was such a joy because all I had to do was look at the illustration that Jack had done and each picture gave me a thousand new ideas. Jack never did a dull panel. Every drawing of his contained an expression [in] the characters' face that almost told me what kind of dialogue to write. Jack could get more drama into a few lines than any artist I knew. His imagination and the things he came up with were wonderful . . . and on top of that, he was fast!<br /><br />\\"I don't know how anybody could have been that good and that fast . . . when Jack drew, you had the feeling that Jack had the entire drawing in his mind and when he put the pencil on the paper he was just 'tracing' what he already had in his mind. Most artists would draw a circle for the head and a circle for the body and then they'd start filling it in, but Jack would just start with the head and he would draw it and every line was there right from the start. He didn't make little rough drawings first . . . it was the most eerie feeling watching him draw--you felt he was tracing what was already in his head. Jack Kirby . . . he was the most dependable artist in the world, he never missed a deadline. He never did a bad job . . . all his jobs were great.<br /><br />\\"It's hard to talk about Jack without sounding as if you're exaggerating because that's how good he was.\\"<br /><br />--Comic Book Marketplace magazine, # 61, July 1998, pages 48-49.<br /><br />What Stan says above fits perfectly with this item from the Marvel Bullpen Bulletin for March 1966, which I presume was written by Stan, and at any rate was published by Marvel, of course:<br /><br />\\"It isn't generally known, but many of our merry Marvel artists are also talented story men in their own right! For example, all Stan has to dowith the pro's like JACK 'KING' KIRBY, dazzlin' DON HECK, and darlin' DICK AYERS is give them the germ of an idea, and they make up all the details as they go along, drawing and plotting out the story. Then, our leader simply takes the finished drawings and adds all the dialogue and captions! Sounds complicated? Maybe it is, but it's another reason why no one else can bring you that old Marvel magic!\\"<br /><br />This is the most thoroughgoing Marvel-published admission of Jack's towering primacy as to the creation of the Kirby/Lee stories that I have ever seen.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Larry Lieber, Stan's brother, wrote the outstanding and thrilling dialogue for the very first story with Marvel's Thor (the origin story, and also a few issues after that), but did so only after Jack had created most or all of the story by drawing it.<br /><br />Again, I love the wonderful dialogue and captioning that Stan wrote, but Stan's own words, quoted above, show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including THOR and THE AVENGERS.<br /><br />Stan was indispensable of course, but so, of course, was Jack Kirby, and now is the time to heap just and due honors upon this great, great storyteller for his stunning, splendid, visionary achievement.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|Having seen The Tuskegee Airmen and being a huge Cuba Gooding fan, I was disappointed in this film.  Cuba Gooding does not have a significant role in this movie, which was a letdown for me.  The action scenes are good; the flight sequences and dogfight scenes are well choreographed and produced.  The movie seems a remake of Tuskegee Airmen and definitely not an improvement.  The plot is loose; there's not much of a build to any sort of climax and at the two-hour mark (approximately), the movie ends.  The only wrap-up is a series of written FYIs exactly like Tuskegee Airmen.<br /><br />I might have enjoyed this movie more had I not seen Tuskegee Airmen before.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game!!!! temple run is the best! its addictive but thats okay i still enjoy it very much well haha boy
B007J4T2G8|3.0|She is a very poor writer writing a series that is in need of a great writer. Could have been great!
014312093X|5.0|If you like literary mysteries, this spy novel is a classic.  I had never read Le Carre but saw he is hailed as the best out there.  Our library mystery group selected this to read for this month and I was glad they did.  Right away I fell in love with Le Carre's writing style.  He's a painterly writer--you can picture scenes and settings and characters.  The dialogue is amazing.  The plot for me was jumpy and complex, rather like real life, and I had to write the characters' names on paper to remind myself of their background when they came on the scene.  But I always felt I was in the hands of a master.<br /><br />Of our group of about 8 who finished the book, 4 of us enjoyed this novel enough to want to read another of the author's.  A few couldn't/didn't finish it because they couldn't follow it.  For me, it helped to see the movie afterwards to mentally put it all together.  I think the book enhances the movie and vice versa.<br /><br />I was curious as to which writers influenced Le Carre and the librarian told us Graham Greene.  Sounds about right.  If you like Graham Greene, literate writing and/or complex spy novels set during the Cold War, you should sample this novel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Don't get married, don't get married, don't get married. Also, don't get married.<br /><br />Gone Girl: A Novel is a dark story about a couple who love and hate each other with fascinating obsession.<br /><br />Flynn writes extremely unlikeable characters but still somehow makes the reader care what happens to them. Care in a `stay up late and yawn incessantly at work the next day because you couldn't stop reading' kinda way. A study of what can result when an extremely intelligent person is also extremely crazy, the combination of the two allowing them to psychologically manipulate someone into total destruction<br /><br />Plenty of plot twists. Even if the reader guesses the twists before they happen, it doesn't detract from watching it unfold. And there are enough of them (twists) that almost everyone will have some surprises.<br /><br />Scary realism about gender roles, sexism, manufactured personalities and psychopathy. Flynn's outlook is bleak, offering no hope for society in general. But her ability to keep the reader hooked on the story of a miserable world filled with miserable people is amazing.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a must have for everyone. It seemed like I waited forever for this game to become available for the kindle fire and I'm glad that the wait is over. So much fun to play and recommend that everyone should download it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book opens up the imagination for sure when it comes to sex, love and trust. It is an erotic story that evolves into a love story. There are many moments in the book that leave the reader captivated and ready for more. I thoroughly recommend this book.

B002GLWMK2|2.0|really a downer. depressing. bad blues. After viewing this, I feel dark and gloomy.<br /><br />If it had been in a theater, I would have walked out of the darkness as soon as possible.<br /><br />Life is so much brighter than this stuff.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think every man in the world needs to read this trilogy!! This is what most women want in a relationship:)))
B0068C9W44|1.0|I do not like this album. The only songs I can stomach are \\"Talk that Talk\\" and \\"We All Want Love. This album is too mainstream. There are too many electro beats and I find no theme. The sounds clash and there's no storyline to follow. \\"We Found Love\\", although it had the potential to be a nice song lacked lyrics and sounded like listening to one big contiunous loop. I do not expect an artist to hit the nail on the head with everyone album but at the same time I do not expect lackluster or \\"filler\\" music. It seems as though someone created filler songs just to call it an album. The best album Rihanna came out with was Good Girl Gone Bad. She was soft, sweet and devilishly edgy. As of now she seems like a media puppet (no fault of her own). I do not recommend anyone purchase this album.
0345803485|5.0|This is the best book ive ever read! I fell in LOVE with Christian Grey and I dont think any man will meet my expectations again. Hope everyone else enjoyed the book as much as I did.

B005LAIGNC|2.0|Very poor acting, very disappointed as I love airplanes, retired from the  US Air Force. I will probably try to resell it on ebay.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|If you like British, you'll love this Exotic Motel flick. A large handful of giants in the UK acting world. All seem to play a character written just for them. That happens sometimes for one actor, but this time it's for many in one film. Perhaps it just seems that way because they are legendary contemporary actors, always at top performance, and make their characters seem so real. Either way, it's British Comedy/Drama perfection.<br /><br />Begin with Dame Judi Dench (Cranford, Love in a Cold Climate, As Time Goes By) and Dame Maggie Smith (Downton Abbey, Harry Potter). Those 2 in one film almost guarantees 5 stars. Then add some more favorites like Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean), Ronald Pickup (Fortunes of War, Jennie), Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey, South Riding), and Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Titanic, Calendar Girls). To top off the cast, they are given a great dialogue script. It's fast-pace but keeping up with this set of old-timers is pure joy.<br />Deborah Moggach wrote the adapted novel, \\"These Foolish Things.\\" She also wrote: Love in a Cold Climate, Diary of Anne Frank, To Have and To Hold, Pride & Prejudice, and more for TV &/or film.<br /><br />Youth will give this a pass, but older adults will LOVE it. It's so right on for anyone old enough to look forward to retirement. But truth shows in the story, it's not always what is expected. Body or spirit or relationships. Some bonny dialogue lines are, \\"We must celebrate the changes.\\" And \\"It will be all right in the end and if it's not all right, it is not the end.\\"<br /><br />Being 64 myself, I can say to younger viewers that this show demonstrates much of life's reality in mature years. And to critics of this film, there IS depth; every main character displays senior life to perfection. The mastery of these actors is only fully appreciated by those of the ages represented.

B007SZ0E1K|4.0|The CPU works great fro my asus motherboard fast and rather easy to put in with steady hands. The only problem i had was the heatsink fan and thermal paste. First the fan didnt work and it didnt have enough paste either. But That didnt matter to me cause i bought an after market cooler master heatsink fan.
0553386794|5.0|an absolute blast to read, keeps be hooked, and intriguing. Much better than the typical fantasy novel, i don't wanna read any other series after this! It's like a soap opera but BETTER and much cooler! Buy it and get hooked into the series and HBO show!

0345525558|5.0|It has been some time since i read a book that did not let me sleep at night, that I just would wake up at 2-3am because I just wanted to see what happen next, this was a beautiful told story, very heartfelt and real, i came across it by chance, i had spend some time unable to find what to read next and wondering thru the aisles i found this treasure, that i just felt in love with, and that i have recommended to all of my friends and everyone who reads this review. I highly recommend this. This story deserves to be seen on the big screen after you have read it of course
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I bought my BUSHNELL TOUR V2 rangefinder a few weeks ago as a gift for my father.<br />It works really well, although the distance measurement is very accurate in the flag mode, in the normal mode not so much.<br />I would recomend it for golf.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved it. If Christian was not beautiful, If he was not a billionaire, would as many people be reading this book. IT's FICTION PEOPLE!!<br />Get real!!  If you do not absolutely fall in love with the description of this romantic lead something is wrong with you.  The writing is fluid, easy,<br />fast to read.  If you have just come off of a double shift at the hospital DON'T START THIS BOOK. You will read (as another reviewer put it) until 4am<br />in the morning.  I've never had so many people at work ask me if I was not feeling well.  Finished the first book and immediately purchased the second book.<br />It was like turning the page.  You can't NOT purchase the second and third books.  You have to know what happens to CHristian and Ana.  Loved it and enjoyed<br />it.  It is truely not about total domination..  YOu can see the point at which Christian starts falling in love and doesn't seem concerned about causing<br />any more pain.  Read this book!!!!  You will enjoy!!

B004QOB8SO|5.0|The HUGE disappointment with SHERLOCK Season 2 is that there are ONLY 3 90-minute episodes. Fans are left wanting more and knowing they have to wait for more episodes.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely amazing as the modern Sherlock Holmes with a twist. This Sherlock is ego-centric and rude yet he possesses amazing detective skills. No one can solve a crime like Sherlock and soon his fame could be his downfall. It looks like the writers, director and stars have taken the international success and tweaked the story of this family literary hero even further. Season 2 is more intense and more dark in its stories. Sherlock is more wrapped in his mind that ever which leads him to be more unstable and unpredictable. Season 2's Sherlock is darker and more self-absorbed than before. His rudeness and impatience with people is stronger. No one can match his superior intellect so they just waste his time.<br /><br />It's amazing how off-putting yet likeable Sherlock is. He offends everyone yet he solves the mystery every time. His exact extent of relationship with John Watson is questioned even deeper. Is there more than just a deep respect for Sherlock that keeps Watson at his side. It's interesting how the writers play with the story and how the success of last season has made them more self-confident and more daring in the risks they take in their storyline. It's a remarkably compelling and unique show.<br /><br />It can get tedious following Sherlock's train of thought as he quickly sizes up a person or situation. One look at a person and he can tell their life story. A bit over the top and obsessive, maybe, but fun.<br /><br />Season 2 ends with a shocking cliffhanger but we soon get our answer which leads to an even bigger question..What just happened? The writers are spot on with the ending. We HAVE to see Season 3 to see how the impossible was possible.<br /><br />SHERLOCK probably isn't for everyone but it certainly is fresh and exciting. A popular classichero is remodeled and revisited in the modern era. The writers have done an amazing job and Benedict Cumberbatch has a definitely exciting career ahead of him.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have been a devout fan of this show from the very beginning and it never fails to surprise me. This series they are stripped from the connections that they would usually be delendant on, which means this series has a whole different dynamic to it, the emotions are deeper more interesting. Jensen and Jared once again show amazing acting skills and present their character to the T. The bad guy leviathan \\"DIck Roman\\" has a perfect face for the part as a smirky, cocky character and plays it well. There are a few un-expected surprises during the show. But when you get the last episode you just want to watch the 8th series out in October! One thing for sure is that this series does resemble season 6 in the way of cinematography and visual effects due to the wonderfull Sera Gamble. BUY IT!!!
0385737955|3.0|I just finished The Maze Runner and I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm really glad I didn't have any huge expectations, because although it was a good story it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />James Dashner shared with us a story about a teenage boy named Thomas who enters the Glade. When Thomas shows up he doesn't remember anything about himself and he doesn't know where of why he is in the Glade.  The only thing he remembers is his name and that's how we start off the story.<br /><br />I think what made the book so slow for me was that Dashner took forever to tell us the background information and finally get into the story. The first few chapters of the book are just Thomas going around trying to find out where he is and why. like the books that tell us the background quickly in the prologue so we can get right into the story and I think if Dashner was to take a little time to write a prologue that told us what the Glade was and things like that it would have been a lot better, For me anyways.<br /><br />I liked the few friendships Thomas had while he was in the Maze. Truthfully he really made about three friends including Chuck, Newt, and Minho. Out of those three Chuck was my favorite because he was with Thomas from the beginning and he was just plain old goofy I loved him! My next favorite was Newt because he was just an all around good guy. He hated the bad guys and he was a great leader! Lastly there was Minho who I liked because he basically took Thomas under is wing.<br /><br />I give this book 3 out of 5 stars because of points I talked about in the beginning, but I'm going to give this trilogy another chance and go ahead and read the second book. Not right away but I'm going to give it a try!
B001HN6918|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example).  Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies.  However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills.  Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.<br /><br />  At the beginning of KFP2, it appears that the panda, Po (voice of Jack Black), has that full and healthy life.  He is now the accomplished dragon warrior and leader of kung fu wizards the Furious Five, and has the respect and admiration of his sensei Master Shifu (voice of Dustin Hoffman), and the loving supervision of his restauranteur father Ping (voice of James Hong).  But in the Furious Five's latest mission to prevent a horde of wolves from looting metal from a local village, Po's confrontation with the Boss Wolf (voice of Danny McBride) triggers a disturbing memory that knocks him off his stride and lets the wolves get away.  As the usually cheerful Po solemnly ponders these memories which seem to show a wolf attack on a village and two parent pandas leaving their baby behind, those memories intertwine with the machinations of the latest garden-variety megalomaniac, Lord Shen (voice of Gary Oldman).  Shen is a colorless peacock who, partly fueled by resentment against parents he sees as stifling, wishes to conquer China and perhaps the world.  Although adept at kung fu, Shen plans to use weapons and artillery to attack, hence the minion wolves' metal raid.  Thus, if we are careful, we see both the main protagonist and antagonist (Po and Shen) as \\"unbalanced\\" individuals seeking to stabilize themselves.  The genius of KFP2 is its demonstration that, in a way, each needs the other for balance.<br /><br />  Nagging at the back of Po's mind is the realization that Ping cannot be his true father.  But as his dreams gradually show, HE was that baby panda abandoned by his parents in the radish box as the wolves attacked.  That box gradually made its way to Ping's shop.  Since Po's parents did not arrive to claim the child, Ping raised Po as his own, with the usual frustrations and complications.  Po is grateful to Ping, but he is out of balance because he can't understand why his parents would leave him.  A calm, unperturbed, ram seer (voice of Michelle Yeoh) eventually shows Po that Shen instigated the attack on his parents' village and that they had to abandon him for his own safety.  But instead of easing his mind, this knowledge awakens feelings of vengeance against Shen and unbalances Po further.<br /><br />  Furthermore, the ram seer nominally works for Shen and constantly reminds him that a force of black and white (i.e. panda Po) will be his undoing and that he should refrain from his conquest.  Shen petulantly and arrogantly refuses to listen. Who - Po or Shen - will embrace balance and, by association, inner peace as exemplified by Master Shifu?  The ram seer advises Po not to obsess on the past but to improve on and develop the present and future.  You know, let it go, and go on.  Does Po listen?  You will see when you witness the climactic confrontration between Po and the Furious Five, and Shen's armed armada sailing down the river to the sea.<br /><br />  KFP2 is an astoundinglytowering tour-de-force.  It takes the standard worn-out martial arts trope, and balances it with respect of ancient Chinese geography, architecture, and philosophy.  It shows ALL its anthropomorphic characters with multifaceted, sometimes opposite, characteristics (serious and playful) striving to keep them working together.  Finally, KFP2 shows us that balanced inner peace is one of humanity's greatest gifts, symbolized by the familiar black and white yin and yang symbol. Po is of course black and white.  Does he eventually symbolize that peaceful yin and yang?  Again, watch the climactic battle, and you will definitely find out.<br /><br />  With this consoling philosophy, KFP2 is a considerable, Pixar-level production, and promises to continue to do so with its sequel-hinting final shot, which promises more conflict but also more consolation for Po.towering tour-de-force.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album is everything I was hoping it would be!  The Beach Boys have always been my favorite...they have a special talent to \\"take you there!\\"  If Ever a Gift was Delivered by God Himself, it was the Gift of Heart, Heavenly Melodies, Pure Love and Perfect Pitch that IS Brian Wilson!  He once said when he was very young that \\"One day people will Pray to God listening to the music I create\\"...He was certainly right as I have done this many times.  May God continue to Bless All our Beach Boys!
B000SZH8LQ|5.0|I love 95% of the songs on this album. It was truly a good buy! The music gave a very soulful R&B vibe.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This album gets 5 stars from me simply because I like more than 3/4 of the tracks on it and all the songs do not sound the same.  So many albums these day have 2 or 3 good songs and the rest stink. This is the first album deserving of my purchase in 3 years.  Shirley's voice is as smooth and sexy as ever. She soothes in \\"Beloved Freak\\" and \\"Felt\\", gets stuck in your head in \\"Blood for Poppies\\", and goes a little nuts in \\"Man on a Wire.\\"  She really mixes it up in \\"The One.\\"  This is my favorite track because it is a fast paced techno jam that will wake you up in the morning! They will be playing it in the clubs soon if they are not already. If I have to say something negative about it, it is the songwriting.  Some of the lyrics just do not make any sense.  For example, in \\"Man on a Wire\\", Shirley describes herself as \\"a big black beast\\" and then \\"like a man on a wire\\" she \\"sets herself on fire.\\"  Can somebody explain to me what this song means?  But I still like listening to it.
0385344228|4.0|So often I'm disappointed by a thriller that promises not to disappoint that I've given up on most reviewer comments over the years.  In this case, the reviews that noted how a reader \\"would be held in suspense until the final pages\\" were spot on.  The work sustained its mystery throughout in a way that felt fresh.  I enjoyed the author's ability to create character and a believable plot.<br /><br />This isn't to say the book is perfect.  Parts of it -- including the scenes between the narrator and his father -- felt forced.  Also, at times, Jacob is a bit too uncommunicative and his parents are too unwilling to probe.  Despite these flaws, the work reads quickly and will not disappoint those looking for a good (haunting) beach read.
B007R1SRTQ|5.0|This album is awesome.  But if you don't pay $4 more for the \\"deluxe\\" version, you will miss out on some great tracks like \\"The One.\\"
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I enjoyed the book overall, and would recommend it as a summer beach read. I also recommend it to expats looking for something to read over coffee.  There are some parts of expat lives that the author nails. It'll bring a smile to your face when you \\"remember when\\". That said - it starts out kind of slow... and then seems like the author needed to cram all the action in all of a sudden at the end. I also thought the CIA thing was unnecessary. It would have been just as good of a story or maybe better for her to quit her job as a bank teller and figure out her new life and husbands secrets. FYI - I think the author had a movie in mind... I think it would make an entertaining movie.<br /><br />My biggest complaint was about the digital formatting. The author flips back and forth in time, and I learned in the book its written in different text so you could tell when you were in one time period. In the digital version there weren't any cues. So you had to read a bit before you could figure out when and where you were. It wasn't impossible by any means, but it would have been nice if they'd have put the 'past' in italics.
B0086700CM|5.0|Superstar REALLY LOVES THIS GAME!!!!!!<br />It is the very very very very very very fun!<br />It is very very addictive
B007H9B8FS|2.0|Garbage was a defining band, that always exceeded expectations.  Alas, now there are really only 2 decent tracks on this album-- the rest are stale and mediocre.  All the right elements are there, yet they somehow feel disconnected, and lack the punch of previous works.  All in all, I was left uninspired.

B005HT400A|5.0|The greatest \\"WTF\\" movie of all time. Extremely bizarre, but very watchable. It's weirdness has stood the test of time.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Of this Martin series, though the first book is fantastic, the following books sequentially bog down into the mire of futility, the hopeless rut of destructive repetition.<br /><br />Martin should take care that Chinese pirating merchants don't produce/sell a reproduction with meaningful plot given a better job reaching climaxes substituting \\"copies\\" from Book Two onward for reader satisfaction. Cut to the chase, Martin. Rewrite your series into a simple trilogy. There are solid structural reasons for the classical success of trilogies that Martin has chosen to ignore in his overgrown vine of a story, peddling pages without end. tsk, squandering talent.
0345525558|5.0|It is a beautiful story that touches our own insecurities.  Don't we all feel unlovable from time to time.  Victoria's solution to feeling unlovable is to push everyone away so that she doesn't have to feel the pain of being turned away.  She has to gradually learn hear own self-worth.
B0067R0APK|3.0|radar works great but as far as the other info goes.....it can be as much as 30 minutes behind and in Texas where the weather changes quickly this is a big negative. so I depend more on weatherbug on my iphone even though the radar isn't as good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought the book to see what all the grumblings were about.  I have sat down and read all three within a week.  Very graphic but the story line is dark and makes you route for the man with 50 shades.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very good game I just don't like that u have to wait to get ur energy up all the time takes a long time that's the only down fall about this game other then that grate.
1423140591|5.0|The first book of the Heroes of Olympus series, the Lost Hero, left me hanging in a way that I didnt feel in the regular Percy Jackson series. However, the Son of Neptune was a great book, bringing Percy back after a swap of him and Jason from the Roman and Greek camps. The plot was great, as was the new characters, Hazel and Frank, bringing in unique characteristics and \\"powers.\\" I can't wait for the Mark of Athena, as the whole crew is back together, along with a clash OR a unity of the Greeks and Romans.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book definitely started off extremely slow.  The first 4 chapters took me a while to get through.  But then comes chapter 5... and it was all uphill from there!  Yes, the book was pure fantasy.  That's why I enjoyed it!  Christian Grey could NEVER be a \\"real\\" person.  He was a character in an erotic book.  I have now started the 2nd book.  Can't wait to see what happens next!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is pathetic, offensive to women, and not worth the time it takes to read it. Although I have not read (and do not intend to read) the subsequent books in the trilogy, I can make an educated guess of the plot and action. The author relied on shock to titillate the reader. One can only hope that the subject matter is a warped fantasy in the author's mind and not reflective of any real events or experiences.
B0086700CM|3.0|u run u jump u slide and that is about it! so I mean it os fun for a while but after about 30 times it makes u bored.
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer is the perfect example of why artists should maintain relative anonymity.  This is a beautiful album and he's a tremendous talent.  It's hard to forget what he has said in interviews and reconcile that with the way he makes music.  If he simply allows his writing to speak for him, he'll be much better off.  Fortunately for him, he didn't ruin his career, just his reputation.
0307477479|4.0|I loved this book. And I admire the author for challenging herself and her readers to a different kind of writing. This is not a conventional novel, but it passed my personal criteria for readability -- I wanted to read it through and finish it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />Yes, it was fragmented, yes it was sometimes difficult to keep up with the characters, but as in all good art,  it communicated ideas and emotion: fear, frustration, tragedy, success, doubt, jealousy, affirmation, love and more than anything, a strong sense of loss.  Yes, these characters all suffered loss in one way or another, loss of youth, of ideals, of dreams unfulfilled, loss of friendship.  This was especially well communicated in the chapters about Rob and Lou.  And, Fiction - as well as Art in general -- is about communication.<br /><br />Each chapter in this book can stand alone as an independent story with a beginning, end and sense of time and place, told from a unique and sometimes disembodied perspective. I loved the Power Point chapter and how it conveyed the essence of the whole book: the precisely placed and enigmatic pause or . . .  space, essential to thought, literature and in this case, music. And more, this chapter answered previously unanswered questions about many of the characters appearing earlier in the novel.<br /><br />Well done, Jennifer Egan.  I look forward to your next endeavor.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed this book as well as the two before it.  Too bad the author is no longer around to write more.  Would have loved to see where this would have gone.
0374203032|5.0|Michael Sandel has written a powerful, concise, compelling and lucid book about the dangers of allowing market values to apply in every area of society. The supposed power of the market to solve all human problems has worked its way insidiously into our thoughts and plans ('markets are the most efficient means of distributing resources'; 'interfering with markets is not only inefficient but dangerous') in many areas where, with hindsight (and thanks to thinkers like Sandel) we may now feel that we should have taken a moral judgement about what might be gained, and what lost, by allowing market forces to interfere with what are, at heart, social and community issues.<br /><br />And how quaint that phrase suddenly sounds. 'A moral judgement.' We have come to be concerned about the appropriateness of making moral judgements in the public arena, whereas the market seems to release us from this responsibility, as in: 'We might not feel entirely comfortable with this outcome, but it is what the market dictates.' And I should stress, at this point, that I am a huge supporter of market forces. Markets are a natural part of human life and a force for good; I subscribe to the view that trade may well be the driving force of civilisation.<br /><br />Sandel's basic premise is set out early in the book and is crystal clear. 'Economists often assume that markets are inert, that they do not affect the goods they exchange. But this is untrue. Markets leave their mark. Sometimes, market values crowd out nonmarket values worth caring about.'<br /><br />What does Sandel mean by this 'crowding out' of values? He gives a number of easily recognisable examples. Queues have a familiar and generally accepted ethic of fairness: first come, first served. But markets are increasingly subverting this simple morality. If you don't want to stand in line to get tickets for free outdoor Shakespeare performances in New York's central park, pay someone to stand in line for you and then give you the ticket. Any ticket that is made available at a fixed price, or even for free, will find its way onto the market - Sandel's most amusing example being tickets to Pope Benedict XVI's stadium masses in New York City and Washington DC. Pay $200 to see the pope conduct mass? How else am I supposed to get a ticket? Airlines increasingly offer a queue-jumping alternative for a higher price. VIP's magically appear at the end of queues in amusement parks and get a ride without waiting. Does this matter?<br /><br />From these gentle shallows of concern, Sandel quickly leads us on into murkier and deeper waters. Paying women drug addicts to be sterilised (to avoid the bad outcome of children with ineffective parents); paying people to take their medicines of to stop smoking. `Do these incentives work?' asks the market enthusiast. `Are they objectionable?' asks Sandel. What does it mean (in the former case) when addicted women's poverty gives them an incentive to take the money? Have they chosen freely or been coerced by their poverty? What does it mean (in the latter case) when high numbers of people paid to stop smoking relapse over time?  Has the 'successful' incentive actually failed to take the place of the effort of will that would create the most genuinely successful outcome?<br /><br />The issue of incentives is, in any case, a famously dodgy psychological area. Fines are meant to be a punishment, a mark of a failure to behave in a socially acceptable manner. But fines can become seen as 'fees'. Wealthier people come to disregard parking or speeding fines, for example. They happily pay what for them is an affordable amount in order to behave in an anti-social way. In one, now famous example, an Israeli nursery started to issue fines if parents arrived late to collect their children. The previous (familiar) sanction had been that of having to face a very cross and disappointed member of the nursery staff whose evening one was now ruining. When a fine was introduced, people began to turn up later to collect their children, not earlier. What was previously a social obligation had been replaced by a commercial transaction. An hour late to pick up the kids? Ah well, better get the cheque book out; can't be helped, and anyway it's worth it. Late arrivals at the nursery continued even after the fines were done away with: parents had acquired a different moral view of lateness.<br /><br />In another, exactly parallel example, a narrow majority of a village community in Switzerland told officials that they would accept a nuclear waste facility near their village, despite the hazards. They were not keen, but their sense of civic duty told them that these things had to be placed somewhere, and they understood the arguments in favour of this particular site. Officials then suggested various monetary incentives that might encourage more residents to support the scheme. Support went down, not up. When the deal was financial, not social, even significant amounts of money were not enough to persuade people to accept the waste site. Suddenly, it wasn't 'worth it' for any amount of money. Their sense of civic duty had been, as Sandel would say. 'crowded out' by the financial offer.<br /><br />These examples, for me, are at the heart (or are at least the most transparently understandable examples) of Sandel's thesis. He takes us on through tradable pollution permits; paying money to hunt endangered species; companies that take out insurance on their employee's lives; the selling of life-insurance policies by old or sick people to third parties to raise immediate cash. You may or may not agree that these are good or bad things in themselves; what is refreshing is to see these issues debated as moral issues.<br /><br />Sandel ends the book with a chapter on the commercialisation of public spaces: the apparently inevitable creep of corporate advertising into the public space that results in sporting stadia and public spaces being renamed after some transient corporation. What once belonged to everyone, and may have had great emotional resonance in many people lives, is now changed. The Chicago White Sox's 'Cominskey Park' (named after an early team owner) is now called U.S. Cellular Field. Cominskey got his name on the park because he bought the team. Now a phone company has trumped Cominskey. Does that matter? I care less about these sporting examples because I am not a sports fan. Maybe sports fans are happy to trade what might be called nostalgia for the hard cash from sponsors that might enable their team to win more trophies. I don't know. But I know how much I would care if familiar and treasured public landmarks were renamed in an exactly similar way.<br /><br />More importantly, I care a great deal about Sandel's central thesis. Free markets are a means by which which the wishes of society can be be most successfully implemented. Markets, in a very meaningful way, 'are' society. But allowing market forces into every area of human society may demean and diminish our sense of civic and social involvement. If everything has its price, then there are no moral judgements to be made. Sandel reminds us, refreshingly and importantly, that in our social lives there are always moral decisions to be made, and that it is potentially dangerous to try to 'incentivise' the right kind of human behaviour and potentially degrading to allow buying power to subvert moral decisions about fairness and decency, or to force its way into public spaces without debate. When what should be communal and social transactions become market transactions, they do change.le began to turn up later to collect their children, not earlier.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! I was so happy when I found out it came out on kindle fire. Its addicting!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|lots of fun! my husband cant keep up with my scores! addictive! cant wait to play more. Lol lots of fun
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that temple run is the best game ive ever heard in my life because it has some things you can upgrade!!!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app provides just enough to allow you to write with the compatibility of MS Office Word and transfer to or from MS Word. If you need more then simply use something else. I like it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard a lot about the book before reading, I don't feel that the news and media give the book a fair shot. I personally love all three books and am looking forward to see what E.L. James writes next!!
B000V1Z0GW|5.0|I'm hardly an expert on Wagner or any opera for that matter but i do know what I like.  I think this 5 hours of highlights (about 72 minutes on each of the operas) is just the perfect overview of the entire ring cycle.  Perfect for listening during your commute or at home as background while reading.  To listen to the Ring in its entirety would take about 16 hours depending on the recording.  Who has time for that?  But with this, you can listen to one opera each day while commuting.  The music is outstanding especially in those stirring passages such as the ride of the Valkeries, Siegfrieds forging of the sword and the immolation scene in Gotterdamerung.  I'm also not an expert on vocalists but I think Wotan, Siegfried, the Rhinemaidens and Hagen are standouts on these discs.  Marton as Brunhilde is fine.  I know some reviews have critized her as being somewhat over the hill at the time of this recording but she's acceptable to me.  Again, I'm no connosseur, just a common sewer as my dad would say, so as a previous reviewer stated if Brunhilde is the make it or break it factor for you then you at least want to hear her somehow before buying.  The fifth disc is larely irrelevent unless you are very knowledgeable in French and want to listen to a seminar on the Ring in that language.  You can find these discs for considerably less than Amazon is asking if you shop around.  There is another set of highlights offered on Amazon, I forget the label but this one is much better. I should know, I own both.  You get more music (70+ minutes per opera vs. about 47 minutes on the other set) and both the orchestra and vocals are far superior on this set.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I thought it was a great movie with an awesome story. Don't understand why it was labeled as being so bad.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|The unfilmable novel produces a truly amazing spectacle.  Smell is translated into vision, in what could surely have been a brilliant silent film.  Despite the major action being scent-based, the sublime use of iconic images produces instantly relatable images that use the classic technique of montage in the original sense (that of two unrelated shots to create an impression of context) to establish the power of the scents experienced by the anti-hero protagonist.  Technically, a superb film that much like Tikwer's other works presents a unified aesthetic essential to the plot and characterization.

B001I45UFC|5.0|This book has been sparking the imaginations of children for decades. A great read for anyone with a mind for a story of valor, redemption, and love.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this show & I have seen each episode at least 7 times. I just want to address some issues that I see raised in the 1-star reviews. I would hate for people to pass on watching the 2nd series because of some unwarranted negative posts (to each his own, I guess). The 2nd season has the same Sherlock writers & they are very exacting about details. This 2nd series is well written & does not stray from Conan-Doyle's vision. There is no disparity between seasons. Many of us would say that the last episode of the 2nd season is the best of all.  There is an amazing twist and powerful cliffhanger. I see a complaint that newer methods of testing evidence are not used - and then there is a complaint that computers are used too much (?).  Sherlock is often in the lab at a morgue/hospital where he tests all types of evidence, i.e. poison, chemical traces, etc. There is no evidence that needs to be tested with fingerprints, DNA, ballistics, etc.  Watch the episodes. Most times those kinds of clues aren't at a true crime scene.<br />  If you like the 1st series then you will no doubt enjoy the 2nd one. I can't say enough wonderful stuff about all 6 episodes. I only regret that we have to wait until late 2013 or early 2014 before the new shows will probably air (in the U.S.).<br /><br />  AFTER BUYING THIS I DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 1/2 HOURS OF EXTRAS !!!!!!!!! \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" and \\"the Hounds of Baskerville\\" are completely reshown with overlapping commentary by the actors and writers. (Yes. Mr. Cumberbatch speaks on the commentary for \\"Scandal\\")  :)  There is also a short (1/2hr? at least) called Sherlock Uncovered in which everyone involved discusses Season 2. This is important to know when considering whether to purchase the DVD. I think it is a tremendous bargain.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read. A lot. This book made me laugh, cry, cry from laughing, and moved me. I have recommended this book to all my friends. It's a great read.
B0001VV1GK|3.0|We bought this for our car obsessed son when he was 2.  He is now turning 4 and still plays with it all of the time, mostly with his matchbox cars but with other die cast cars that a bit bigger too.  But our elevator broke after only having it for a few months.  We were very disappointed as that is half the fun of this parking garage.  It is a good size though - doesn't take up too much space and is not as tacky as the giant plastic garages.
0345803485|3.0|I will say that I am only a little more than half way through the first book, so my opinion may be a little premature...So far, this book kind of makes me sick.  Who's fantasy is it to be flogged, or told they cant touch the person they're having sex with, or have to refer to someone as \\"sir\\" or they're punished?? The whole allure of being a \\"submissive\\" is infuriating, if you ask me! How is this sexy?? I know with all the rules CG sets out, where I am in the book, they havent gotten to all of it yet.  But just hearing the things he says to her and how she crumbles and obeys is kind of disturbing.  I cant look at this as a \\"romance\\" when he talks about owning her and how she can \\"not think, just do\\" when she is his. He's turning her in to a doormat and as many times as the author puts in her thoughts that say things like, \\"Why would he say that?\\" or \\"What a control freak!\\", she is still the wet rag he wants her to be willingly.<br /><br />I really hope I start to like these books better, I had very high hopes.  Maybe that's the problem...
0061906220|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old son and I were able to experience Pete the Cat at a \\"mommy and me\\" class. It was love at first site and sound!  I definitely recommend looking online for the tune of the song which is so catchy and memorable.  Pete the Cat is a cool cat who doesn't cry over silly things. Sometimes, when my son is whining over something like spilled juice, I ask him, \\"Would Pete cry?\\"  He responds as the book does, saying \\"Goodness no!\\" and  stops crying. We are do happy to have met Pete and look forward to more of his stories!

0143116177|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It wasn't full of hard to understand concepts.  Ferguson does a good job of laying out the impact of money on different world events.  Definately would recommend this to everyone.
1594488878|3.0|Read this immediately following a fat, very literary, prize-winning \\"a universe between its covers\\" novel, after which Nick Hornby, a favorite writer, seemed pretty thin beer. But Nick cannot be other than entertaining and, in his own contemporary popular-cultural domain, knowledgeable and insightful. Anyone who's ever been or known an obsessive fan - and most particularly, a \\"completist,\\" who MUST own, and thus gather, compulsively, every shred of information (or media - print, recorded music, film, videotape, etc.) on an artist - should find something to laugh at here. Hornby knows how the human heart operates as well, and makes good sense of the meandering and imprecise logic of infatuation and love. If not wholly implausible, JULIET, NAKED takes a lovely and believable premise and stretches it into a Dickensian pretzel to make all the ends meet in a not wholly convincing way. But it's a brisk and bracing ride, filled with quirkily entertaining English-art-house-movie (and why hasn't this immensely photogenic novel already been filmed?) characters. Moreover, as a near manic music lover and sometime music obsessive, I was happy I took this one out for a spin.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool ranks among the best science fiction I have read and its author, Hugh Howey, seems destined to join the pantheon of sci-fi greats like Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Niven, Gibson, etc. It is made all the more extraordinary by having been published by the author himself rather than through the homogenizing filter of major commercial publishing houses. Wool is engaging, thoughtful science fiction brought to you directly by the author.

B00008OE4W|5.0|So many reviewers have raved about this film, and I cannot add to what they've said.  Note that most of the negatives refer to the quality of the disc, not the movie.  But look at that cast!  Ackroyd, Redford, Poitier, Strathairn, McDonnell> Busfield and Kingsley as the bad guys. George Hearn in a walk-on!  Just think about the rehearsals!  Oh to be a fly on the wall during the shoot.  I just watched it for the fourth or fifth time, and it still works.  Totally entertaining, which is what a movie is supposed to be.
B0086700CM|5.0|ihave been waiting so long for this game it is my favorite game currently if you haven't downloaded it yet I suggest u do it now!

B003VANOFY|5.0|Bottom line is that this headset is great! I was upgrading from a Razer Charcharias which I'd been using for 2 years. While it was still in great condition after 2 years, one wire runover finally took its toll. So i decided, I'll try to get a wireless headset to completely avoid that problem.<br /><br />I am very impressed with what Logitech delivered in this item. The wireless is awesome. They advertise 40 ft range, which is about right. Battery time is also great. The dongle hub that comes with it gives you more than enough wire length incase you forgot to charge the headset and need to game wired.<br /><br />The mic sounds crisp and clear, as well as adjustable. The headphone design is very comfortable and very noise cancelling. The G keys come in handy for Spotify, as well as for the voice morphing functions that come with the CD installation. Speaking of installation, setup was a breeze. And I haven't had any problems with the headphones making any buzzing sound. If you adjust your settings right you shouldn't have any. The stereo sound from this headset is great, but the 7.1 surround sound, man what a difference. The ONLY complaint that I have is that because the earcups swivel, they do make a slight crack sound when they swivel. But do not fear, these headphones feel sturdy, crackling or not. A little crackling for superb comfortability. Once they're on your head, you won't hear a thing.<br /><br />Sound (both stereo and 7.1 surround):10/10<br />Ergonomics (build quality, G keys, volume roller, comfortability):9.8/10 (crackling)<br />Mic Quality:10/10<br />Setup:10/10<br />Wireless:11/10 - you may not think it's that big a deal. But once you have it, you won't want to risk running over your wire ever again.<br />Battery:10/10<br /><br />Overall, if this headset is in your price range, or in your view for a future purchase, you'll have made a great choice if you buy it! An awesome gaming headset that delivers!!

B005LAIGSC|2.0|Sorry my wife purchased this movie.  Denzel is a great actor, but while watching the movie I had to check to see if we were having an earthquake or if I've had too much coffee.  I almost got seasick watching this. The camera work is terrible, always shaking and moving all around.  Maybe the camera people had too much coffee ? What were they hiding ?  A poorly developed screen-play I guess.<br /><br />Characters are poorly developed. Even Denzel couldn't save this flick.  Don't waste your time.
B0086T71MM|5.0|I came of age in LA during the very late 60's and began working in large LA corporations in the early 1970's.  I recognize this environment veerrry well.  I am bemused by the reviewers in the blogs I have read concerning this show.  They express dismay that \\"strong\\" Joan has sold herself out.  First of all, I think Pete's handling of the proposition was masterful.  Both the acting and the writing were top notch.  Joan, whether or not her many fans (I am certainly one) wish to admit it, has been selling herself for decades.  She has picked and chosen men who would give her what she wanted.  By and large she has dated men (certainly like married Roger) who \\"treat her right.\\"  Buy her presents, lavish opulent surroundings on her, etc.  She has perhaps deceived herself and not gotten the property (in her own name--job skill one for a courtesan) or reaped the long-term financial security a more focused woman doing what Joan does, would have achieved.  Joan has saddled a man she should never have married (but she did marry him for security, a \\"Mrs.\\" and the status of marrying a doctor) with an expensive and fraudulent lie, while piously turning down Roger's checks (which, judiciously handled, could provide her with security).  Instead, she makes a pragmatic decision and, I feel, earns respect and not its obverse, from the men she works with--men who know her quite well.  I feel such immense fondness for Lane, in this situation, who, facing ruin, and with no ass to peddle, gives Joan wise counsel.  I feel for Joan, totally understand what she did, and, in the context of her own checkered life, feel she made the right decision.  The getting of wisdom and its real price--that's how I see this episode.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|My official rating for this movie is a 3 stars out of 5. My review is full of spoilers so don't read if you haven't seen it. Prometheus is one of those movies that is hyped beyond expectation, literally. The hype for this movie was too high, and unfortunately left many disappointed. I didn't have any real expectation or idea of what the movie was going to be like, but I was pleasantly surprised of how good this movie is. The acting is superb from all actors. The main character, Shaw, really gave this movie that needed thrill and horror factor. Shaw goes through absolutely hell before she gets off that damn planet. She survived an attack against a 8ft tall humanoid, and had to surgically remove an alien feeding off of her womb while conscious. While she tries to survive with a stapled stomach. Noomi really gave us that amazing acting to give us anxiety and make us cringe of the horrors she was going through. All characters had their own personality. Charlize was pure evil, but her evil is more of a survival instinct. The \\"space jockey\\" is really creepy and demonic looking, which makes \\"him\\" look really intimidating and scary, which is the point. The visuals are amazing and huge in scale. I paid attention to certain details of the characters. For example, Shaw was a believer in God, and it was very interesting how battling against an alien made her faith in God even stronger. I am excited of how the home world of the \\"space jockey\\"/aliens will look like, and what the next explorers or Shaw will discover. My favorite elements of the movie are the small things in the characters, like Shaw's faith, and how the captain of prometheus was really dedicated to not transport death to earth, and how charlize's character is somewhat mean and cold because her father treated her that same way. Very good movie, and may not be for everyone. A solid 3 stars.
B000PUXCQY|3.0|Songs from Tsongas is my only YES concert DVD in my collection presently.<br /><br />And yes, I do count myself a YES fan...maybe not the biggest or the most knowledgeable, but a fan nonetheless.<br /><br />I watched this video again last night, probably the third or fourth time since buying it late last year. My initial impression of the concert footage was, Wow. This (YES) is a body of work that represents the best music that ever was birthed by prog rock in my opinion. I sat and watched this concert in amazement, impressed that despite the years that have passed (nearly 30 years) since Yes' first album, these guys still got it. At least, 3/4 of the way through the concert, they still got it.<br /><br />There are a host of reviews here that can give you a song-by-song review; this is not one of them. Rather than re-hash what others have likely written before me, I wanted to focus more on the production quality, artistry & musicianship, and the like.<br /><br />The production quality of the disc is generally very good. Camera angles capture all the right moments, zooming in on soloists or panning the crowd's reaction to high points in the music being performed. Audio quality is decent, but not great; I tried the different Audio options (Dolby Stereo, Dolby 5.1, and DTS) and decided Dolby 5.1 sounded best on my system. Compared to another concert DVD in my collection, the audio quality is not as crisp as the Toto: Falling in Between Live disc on Blu-ray. Minor point, but take half a star off the 5 you start with...now, this might improve if the concert is re-released on Blu-ray, perhaps, but that still might not tweak it enough for my ears.<br /><br />Musically speaking, the performances by the musicians were top-notch. Steve Howe could give a clinic on how to play the guitar (and other stringed instruments - electric, 6-string acoustic, lap steel, dobro, 12-string acoustic, dual-neck 6- & 12-string electric, Portuquese guitar) from this DVD alone. Rick Wakeman...man, this guy's got all kinds of keyboards surrounding him; knowing how layered the Yes sound is, it's hard to believe how he makes it look so easy to reach from his Mini-Moog to his Korg Triton, changing tones, bending notes, all the while keeping time, like a wizard plays his fingers over spellbooks. Especially fabulous to me is how all the musicians blend and flow with each solo played.<br /><br />Yes fans probably know their discography well enough to know the songs simply by hearing the first notes or chords struck, but the DVD also features the song title as the band begins to play each song. Nice touch, but like I said, likely unnecessary for Yes fans. Quite helpful, however, for those new to Yes who may not be able to determine where one song ends and the next begins. Concert is divided into two DVDs, but the intermission comes before the first DVD's content capacity ends. This leads to an odd feeling when going from the full stage set -> acoustic set -> Steve Howe solo (\\"Second Initial\\") -> end of the acoustic set, because you never get that \\"pause\\" where you can get up and head for some snacks before playing the next DVD. I love the two basses that Squire plays throughout...the green demon and that classic Ricky...and for an old guy, Alan White's rhythms never miss a beat, and that says a lot for a musician who has to keep time for an entire band that creates polyrhythmic compositions. With that being said, I must deduct another half a star from the 5-point total because of the disjointed intermission/DVD split.<br /><br />This leads me to my last star deduction: most bands, and Yes is no exception, throw in an acoustic set to change things up (plus, it gives some of the guys in the band a much-needed breather). Most of the times, an acoustic set is welcomed by fans because it gives a new wrinkle to an old tune now and then. Most of the songs in the acoustic set in this DVD were rather well done, especially giving Roundabout a more boogie-woogie feel to therhythm section. I liked just about every song they did in this set, up until they began playing, first, \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\", which I thought was poorly done - the studio version, with the amount of layering that had to be done to capture all the background vocals, instrumentals, etc. is far superior - and this live version doesn't even come close. When I heard the first notes \\"Rhythm of Love\\" begin, I could just feel it in my soul that this was NOT going to appeal to me. I had an even harder time just staying with the song long enough to get through it to watch the rest of the DVD. This is one of the YES songs that I absolutely love, and love to turn up the volume to as high as my ears can stand it. If I didn't like the rendition of \\"Owner\\", I absolutely HATED this version of \\"Rhythm\\".<br /><br />Sadly, those are the only two songs I didn't enjoy from the acoustic set that I really was looking forward to on this DVD. To my delight, however, the other songs in the acoustic set were, in the only way I can describe it, delicious.

Keyboards sound cheesy (synth brass doesn't quite cut it), bass line is lazy, and the drums - well, Alan White does his best to keep the pace going but he's fighting a losing battle. Howe's guitars on this song don't sound as meaty and crunchy as the studio version. A big sigh.

B0083GCK5G|5.0|6/7/12  On 6/5/12, The Beach Boys released their new album, their 29th, \\"That's Why God Made the Radio,\\" to help mark and celebrate the band's 50th anniversary. I immediately downloaded it and listened to it all the way through three straight times yesterday. In my very humble opinion there are not enough or sufficient superlatives to describe it. Simply, WOW!!! At $4.99 on Amazon, it is the bargain of the century. Frankly, it is a bargain at any price. If you like harmony like I do, you'll love this album!!!Buy it! You won't be disappointed. And, no, I'm not on commission.

B0086700CM|3.0|It is a fun game, but it needs an objective to reach. the end of the maze. you don't have one here. If there was one, I would give it 5 stars
B007X16GFC|5.0|It isn't often anymore that you come across a good flick, but this one surprised me.  Of course Mark Wahlberg does not disappoint, he was great and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I would watch this again.

0307730697|5.0|Few novels truly capture the sentimentality and raw friendship that develop in a lifetime, but 'Fearless' by Eric Blehm manages to radiate the honesty of Adam Brown's life in this startling biography. No American doubts the physical and mental strength of a SEAL, but the spiritual, Christian love Brown exuded through his whole life proved to be almost more impenetrable than his war-torn body. I recommend this to anyone who is searching for direction or meaning in their life: if approached with an open heart, there is no way you could walk away without discovering strength in  yourself that you never could have seen without this heart-warming role model.
B003LR5BD0|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's movies.  If you are as well, but haven't seen this film, then it's a must.  Personally, I feel that Insomnia is the weakest of Nolan's movies, but it is a strong film nonetheless and one of Pacino and William's darkest combined roles.<br />Compared to Memento, Inception, The Prestige, Batman Begins & The Dark Knight, I feel this movie is not as great but still has a lot of suspense, great acting, but a few bad writing/transition spots.<br /><br />Pacino's lack of sleep and how it's portrayed is amazing and you feel like you're experiencing the side effects of a sleep-deprived person alongside Pacino's Dormer character.

B002ZB26AO|4.0|This is a very interesting and seemingly accurate book. I have enjoyed reading it so far. My only complain is that it's a little repetitive. I am enjoying it though. It's insight into North Korea is amazing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Wow, what to say.  I am an avid reader and chose this trilogy after finishing the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy.  I finished \\"The Hunger Games\\" (all 3 books) in less than a week.  This one took me at least 3 weeks and that was a struggle.  My first thought was that you could obviously pay to have your book on the best seller list.  I felt the story line was extremely weak, and couldn't quite get into the sexual side of it.  I'm no prude, being a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon, Larissa Ione etc., but this was a little too weird for me.  Also, the \\"oh my's\\" and other phrases the main character uses, is just a little corny.  I actually caught myself \\"rolling my eyes\\" quite a few times.  I guess that deserves a good spanking!  I have a lot of respect for authors, but I'm sorry about this one...just can't say good things about these books.  When I finished, I felt like I had totally wasted all the time I forced myself to finish reading them.
0553801473|5.0|I am glad I did not become thoroughly convinced this book was a stinker by all the negative and so-so reviews here. As it was, I put off reading it for awhile, because I somehow knew I would not like it. But surprisingly, I really liked it. Much better than the usual clap-trap that is produced as fantastic fiction these days. DWD was well written, thought provoking, and intense at times. The only problem I usually have with these books is the orgy of cruelty and brutality lavished upon the reader. Martin could use to stand back a bit from the excruciating detail involving this, but that is a minor flaw to me. As for waiting another six years to find out what happens to the characters, no big deal. There are plenty of other great books to read while waiting.
030758836X|5.0|This book was a roller coaster ride that I won't soon forget. What appears to be something grabbed from today's headlines turns out to be much more dark and sinister. Nick and Amy Dunne have hit a rough patch in their marriage when Amy suddenly disappears on their fifth anniversary. As the investigation deepens Nick becomes the prime suspect.<br /><br />During the first part of this book it seemed just like one of those all to familiar mysterious disappearances of a loving, devoted wife. I found myself being sucked into the story and cast in the roll of the disgusted public calling for the husband's head. It seemed obvious that Nick was behind the disappearance, and I felt horrible for Amy.<br /><br />I was not prepared for the jaw-dropping revelation in the second part. The twists in this book boggled my mind. The tangled web of this story became more intricate until the climax of the third part. This book will leave readers still thinking about it long after they finish it. An absolutely thrilling book that will mess with your mind.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was really helpful. It was well written and didn't confuse me at all. I was able to follow the guidelines presented and I published my first ebook with ease. Thanks a lot.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad to see that android finally picked up Temple Run! Awesome game! Plus it really helps enhance your reflexes and your hand/eye coordination the more you play it.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|First thing I noticed was Miniclip included Openfeint (again). Lose 1 star. Overall this game is simple to play but enjoyable. Gravity Guy runs and you control when he flips (or change gravity as the game says). You have to outrun a robot chasing you while avoiding walls, gaps in the &quot;floor&quot; and &quot;ceiling,&quot;  other obstacles. Also, there are speed boosts that GG can run over which adds to the challenge. If you get caught or fall, you have to start from the last checkpoint. Last, once you use all your slow motions you have to $buy$ more. Lose 1 star. The sound and graphics are good and the controls are easy to use (simply tapping the screen) as well. I did not see ads while playing for about 20 minutes. HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.
B0086700CM|5.0|just get it; that's all I can say. you will become addicted the moment toy start to play. that is guarenteed!
0679805273|5.0|This is a great gift for a student. I purchased this for my kindergartener and had the teacher write a note in it and I plan to keep it up each year then my children will have a keepsake to remember all teachers with a note of encouragement.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game! It doesn't always have the best response time (or even a response at all and then I fall off...), but it is still a lot of fun to play! One of my friends in orchestra would steal other people's phones to play this game, and now I know why! lol!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I would like to take a moment to recommend this product and, more importantly, to mention the exceptional tech support and customer service I received when the product didn't work out of the box.  The problem was not with the device itself, but with the connector cable.  I sent an email to dbtech@camarketing.com and got a response within 10 minutes offering to replace the product free of charge if I just provided my Amazon order number.  Sam, the tech support rep, also left his phone number so I called immediately.  He walked me through the installation, determined that it was not the device but the cable and immediately shipped me two new (longer) cables.  Thank you, Sam, for your exceptional customer service.

B0060MYM3S|4.0|I LOVE this show.  Yes, I'm a hugeee book fan and don't appreciate all of the changes in the show, but overall I am a huge fan.<br /><br />Rating guide:<br />Non-readers: 4-5 stars<br />General book readers: 3.5-4.5 stars<br />Book purists/fanatical: 0-2 stars<br /><br />This is a great show, but in my eyes it's just not as good as season 1.  It is definitely better compared to most of what is on television and the acting is superb and extremely well cast.  However, my problems with this season revolve around two main issues:<br /><br />#1) the severe deviations from the books that the D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have taken.  In the first season deviations existed, but mostly to the point to help with time/budget constraints.  The writers still generally stayed true to the characters.<br /><br />Season 2 is a whole different story.  GRRM has spoken many times of the Butterfly Effect.  The more the writers change things, the more the story is going to change in the long run.  With the huge amount of characters in the series, seemingly little changes can have huge implications.  While season 1 generally stayed true to the novel (which I gave five stars to), season 2 took a life of its own.  Many story lines were completely invented or so heavily modified that they barely were anything like the books.<br /><br />I know that television/movies adaptations MUST be different from the books.  However, I think it's crucial that the writers still accurately capture the essence of the characters.  When the writers started to play with the characters and get cute, I decided that they weren't doing it due to budget/time constraints, but because they thought they were *better.*  And they're not.<br /><br />#2) It isn't as nearly as good overall this season compared to last, REGARDLESS book deviations.  Storylines drag, some dialogue is so bad that it seems like it was taken out of a cheesy soap opera (cliches abound), there are really disjointed and awkward scenes, and they can't seem to do much else except have two people in a room talking to each other.  The pacing to me was just off this season.<br /><br />More in-depth look at my problems with season 2:<br /><br />*Important scenes and character arcs are modified beyond recognition.  While some changes must be made for the sake of adaptation, that's not true for everything.  There was no reason to completely change The House of the Undying scene, which was one of the most interesting scenes in the entire series to something that was so irrelevant and had nothing to do with a \\"song of ice and fire.\\"  it wouldn't have hurt to use a little more caution with Jon's character as well, because his famous \\"kill\\" was confusing and its intentions unclear to many viewers.  Arya's storyline was not a bad one in the show, but looked like a Disney version of what was in the books.  I was looking forward to seeing the gritty brutality of it, and instead it just fell flat.  Robb Stark....I don't even want to go there.  It may be his storyline that infuriates me the most out of them all.  In the books he was a fool that I could sympathize with; in the show he's not only a fool, but a jerk (to put it mildly). I won't go into details due to spoilers and you may not understand if you haven't read the books, but his character is butchered beyond redemption.<br /><br />*Women are dramatically different in the show than the books.  The writers feel the need to make the majority of the female cast \\"badass,\\" ruthless, and/or bratty.  An example is Tyrion's whore, Shae.  In the books she is very obedient to Tyrion and very much acts like a prostitute (which she is).  She shows signs of cleverness, but most of their interactions are based on sex and lust.  In the show, Shae has a huge potty mouth, acts like a big \\"tough girl,\\" and doesn't treat Tyrion like someone of high noble birth in the slightest.  The writers think they are making a more complex and dynamic character by making Shae witty and rebellious, because that seems like Tyrion's type of gal.  However, nothing's ever so simple.  One of Tyrion's biggest weaknesses is his naivety in love and even though he *knows* Shae is at the root, just a whore in it for money, he can't stay away from her.  It's a richly layered story that doesn't need assistance from the writers.  They also changed Robb's love interest to someone completely different, and once again she was more of a \\"bratty rebel.\\"  Dany is another character that is also much more cruel in the show.  The writers have no imagination when it comes to writing/modifying the women in the book.  And Sansa, one of the main characters in the books, is hugely neglected for most of the season.  I guess she just isn't \\"cool enough.\\"<br /><br />Not to mention, Dany's entire storyline in Qarth was different.  Hardly any of it was from the books.  I understood and expected that, considering she was rather inactive for most of book two and her chapters were admittedly pretty boring, but instead of changing it for the better, they somehow managed to turn it into a ridiculous soap opera that made little to no sense.<br /><br />*Cheesiness.  One of the things I love about GRRM is that he is never a cheesy romance writer.  I DO enjoy scenes that show true emotion and express things I can empathize with, such as love for others.  I DON'T enjoy super contrived, cheesy romance stories that are so cliche and boring that not even my most \\"hopeless romantic\\" friends can enjoy it.  And there was just too much of that in this show, especially between Robb and a certain love interest.  The dialogue was just atrocious.  But David Benioff DID write Troy, so that explains quite a bit.<br /><br />*Two characters talking to each other in a room.  It seems like practically every scene is two people in a room talking to each other.  The writers don't seem to excel particularly well at writing group scenes, and like the one-on-one talks.  This is alright to an extent, but I think sometimes it makes it come off as a cheesy medieval soap opera.  Not good.<br /><br />An example of this is Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister in Harrenhal.  Charles Dance and Maisie Williams have amazing on-screen chemistry together and are a joy to watch, but they had their little back-and-forth banter for what....4 episodes?  It got a little old.  Arya is supposed to be going through a living HELL while at Harrenhal, not hanging out with Daddy Warbucks all the time.<br /><br />*All of the little mistakes.  A few mistakes is normal and expected - a ton is not and a sign of lazy writing.  These writers claim to making a somewhat faithful adaptation of ASOIAF, yet they continue to mess up religions, locations, and simple Westerosi facts the entire show.  And these weren't things that had anything to do with budget constraints.  Having northern men referencing to praying to the Seven for instance, is completely unfaithful to the books, and the only reason I can come up with them changing it is simple - lazy writing.  The Old Gods were already mentioned several times in season 1, so there is no reason to have men of the North praying to gods of the South.  A bunch of little things like that add up over time and seem like a disservice to book readers.  Most of us highly appreciate the little things in the books being acknowledged and done correctly.  Not to mention, these errors could be seen by even a non-reader, considering religions have already been established and explored to a degree in the first season.<br /><br />If you are a book reader and can completely separate the books from the show in your head, you can still enjoy this.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and brutal.  It moves at a rather uncomfortably slow pace, but gains some momentum toward the end.  Also, the show is mostly very good at staying true to Theon's arc, which is one of the most interesting in the series.  The Battle at Blackwater Bay Episode (8) was also phenomenal, and written by GRRM himself.  It is possibly the greatest battle scene in television HISTORY.  If only he could be a writer in every episode!<br /><br />I would also like to add that GRRM does NOT have any sort of veto power or control over the script and final decision making.  He can loosely be called a \\"consultant\\" and has one episode a season to write, but that's it.  He has said himself that D&D can do whatever they want (turn the characters to zombies or getting abducted by aliens is all within their right - HIS WORDS) and he can't stop it.  The show is D&D's baby, not his.  He doesn't \\"approve\\" or \\"sign off\\" on anything.  I know that D&D probably for the most part kind of want to stay true to the books, but they DO NOT HAVE TO.  Proof is in my second comment - and that's in reference to the very faithful first season, not season 2.<br /><br />Great things about this season?<br />-Amazing CGI and battle scenes, including the direwolves.  Grey Wind is fierce and Ghost is just beautiful.<br />-Superb casting.  Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, Conleth Hill as Varys, Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, and the list goes on and on.  We also have the addition of Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth and many other new characters, and Christie as Brienne is just perfection.  She IS Brienne.<br />-With a few exceptions, Theon Greyjoy's storyline was an excellent book to television translation. It's a shame how quickly the seasons have to move, because it's one of the most intriguing storylines in the entire series.  Alfie Allen also gave a stellar performance as Theon.<br />-Brienne/Jaime scenes were classic and they have great on-screen chemistry.<br />-The behind the scenes look at the Loras/Renly/Margaery triangle was very well done.<br /><br />And that's just a few.  It's great in MANY ways and is beautifully done on so many levels.<br />I would also make a list of things that book purists wouldn't like, but that would be about 20 pages (not kidding).<br /><br />So, do I recommend this?  Definitely not to a severe book purist, but yes in general and definitely to a non-reader.  I personally don't enjoy the major deviations and wish they would stay truer to the novel, but it all depends on the viewer.  I'm not trying to say that this a terrible show, because it's not.  It's beautiful and I'm thrilled to see some of my favorite characters ever come to life.  It's simply just becoming more and more different from the books, and for some people like me, that's not appreciated.  Just remember, this isn't A Song of Ice & Fire this season, but a loose adaptation of it set in an ASOIAF world.  And not to mention, in my opinion this is a downgrade from the first season, book reader or not.<br /><br />I have faith though that things will become better in the future, however, because A Storm of Swords will be broken up into two seasons.  That will give the writers some more leeway and time to develop things (hopefully).  Also, we have some great new cast members for next season, such as Iwan Rheon (probably as Ramsay Bolton), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds (as Mance Rayder and played Caesar in HBO's Rome), Tobias Menzies (as Edmure Tully and was in HBO's Rome as Brutus [funny, huh?]), Clive Russell as Brynden \\"The Blackfish\\" Tully, Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, and a host of other new cast members.  Lots to look forward to!akes it come off as a cheesy medieval soap opera.  Not good.<br /><br />An example of this is Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister in Harrenhal.

Also, we have some great new cast members for next season, such as Iwan Rheon (probably as Ramsay Bolton), Ciarán Hinds (as Mance Rayder and played Caesar in HBO's Rome), Tobias Menzies (as Edmure Tully and was in HBO's Rome as Brutus [funny, huh?]), Clive Russell as Brynden \\"The Blackfish\\" Tully, Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell, and a host of other new cast members.  Lots to look forward to!
0307237699|1.0|When you've read to the end, come back and read this first paragraph again.<br /><br />A Coil of Rage!<br /><br />The character of any man is defined by how he treats his mother as the years pass...<br />need I say more about this person below other than there is no character, no integrity<br />but there is a ton of attitude and arrogance that defines his shallow past and hollow future...<br />I rest my case.<br /><br />I bought and read Obama's book,Audacity of Hope. It was difficult to read considering his<br />attitude toward us and everything American. Let me add a phrase he used to describe his<br />attitude toward whites. He harbors a \\"COIL OF RAGE\\". His words not mine.<br /><br />THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT -- HE'S RUNNING AGAIN, YOU KNOW! Is anyone out there awake?<br /><br />Everyone of voting age should read these two books by him: Don't buy them, just get them from the library.<br /><br />From Dreams From My Father:<br /><br />\\"I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.\\"<br /><br />From Dreams From My Father:<br /><br />\\"I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.\\"<br /><br />From Dreams From My Father:<br /><br />\\"There was something about her that made me wary, a little too sure of herself, maybe and white.\\"<br /><br />From Dreams From My Father:<br /><br />\\"It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.\\"<br /><br />From Dreams From My Father:<br /><br />\\"I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa , that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself: the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.\\"<br /><br />And FINALLY...........and most scary:<br /><br />From Audacity of Hope:<br /><br />\\"I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.\\"<br /><br />If you have never forwarded an e-mail, now is the time to do so!!! We have someone with this mentality running our GREAT nation! Keep your eye on him and don't blink.<br /><br />I don't care whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, a Conservative or a liberal, be aware of the attitude and character of this sitting President.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'm enjoying this series immensely. The characters are given ample time to develop and tell their side of the story. I really like how the story allows the characters to be fleshed out versus having their every motive explained by the author. The characters don't talk to themselves to explain things. We watch and figure it out along the way. But just when you think you have something figured out, an event changes everything. I've learned to not get too attached to a character or storyline. Overall, the books are long, but when I finish one, I move right on to the next because I don't want the story to end.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to use and everything you need! I LOVE IT!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is all done online and doesn't download your stuff onto your kindle. I can't read it on the airplane. :-(

0345803493|3.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />This book is successful as 'light porn' for the ladies but not successful in the BDSM arena.  Christian is not dominant and Ana is certainly not submissive.  For those reasons, I was disappointed and felt a bit defrauded.  I know, buyer beware.<br /><br />A dominant does not whine and pout everytime the submissive says 'no,' and a submissive does what she is told without constant, every 5 minutes questions. It's not like he didn't tell her every step of the way what to expect, and the bogus contract... he backed down on every item.<br /><br />Just not my cup of English tea.

B007549YM4|4.0|This movie shocked me in some ways. It surely will stir your emotions and stay with you long after it's over. Talk about slow descent into madness... The ending is especially well-done in my opinion. If for nothing else, the score is worth listening to. Recommended if you are into apocalyptic films. Blu-ray only has a commentary and trailer of the film.

0060873027|4.0|As a fan of Michael Crichton I was excited to hear that his final, incomplete project would be finished and published though I had my worries as to who was up to the task.  When I discovered that Richard Preston had been chosen to take the manuscript to the finish line I breathed a sigh of relief.  I had read The Hot Zone several years ago and really enjoyed that thrilling tale of terror in which Preston handled the science, medical and biological, aspects of the story well and I could see him doing the same in a Crichtonian way.  Micro has the typical Crichton setup, scientists of various disciplines are gathered together by a person who is using a new technology that has both great promise and great danger.  The main action of the book occurs on the island of Oah'u Hawai'i, where I recently was conducting research and completing graduate school so I immediately felt some familiarity with the characters.  The authors include many little details of life in Hawaii, simple customs, places, foods and such, that added a nice realistic backdrop to the story.  This realism is especially extended into the insect/arachnid scale world of Hawaii in which the micro-miniaturized heros find themselves.  I felt the beginning of the book was a little slow but picked up my pace and interest as I progressed.  The appearances of the creatures in this micro world are accurate, from the wasps and terrible Hawaiian ant problem to the dreaded vemonous centipede.  The contrast between the extremely benign macroscopic Hawaii and the savage micro world is very stark.<br /><br />I often felt like I was reading Jurassic Park again, but in reverse.  Instead of giant lizards eating people the people are now micro being attacked by bugs.  However, I give credit to the authors that some unexpected events take place which I feel were rather gutsy from a storytelling standpoint which differentiates it a bit from Jurassic Park.  There is a good deal of action and details of the micro world's biologythat keep things interesting.  Micro is not great literature or a deep thinker, but the adventure is fun and Preston has done a good job of completing Crichton's final novel for the fans.  Read Micro for fun, not solemn seriousness.

0307266303|5.0|I''ve just recently gotten into running- mainly leisure runs and more recently a 12K race. Up until about 6 months ago I never imagined myself a runner because I spent the previous 10 years competing in bodybuilding shows. Bodybuilders do not run. We eat, perform steady state cardio and lift weights. We aim to conserve energy to avoid catabolism (loss of muscle), so running was never on my radar.<br /><br />I've been semi-retired from bodybuilding since 2009 and have been impatiently waiting for a new physical endeavor to fire me up the way Bodybuilding always had... it's taken a few years, but running has become my new passion. I never imagined it in my wildest dreams because even as a kid, I never enjoyed it.<br /><br />This book has ignited a fire under my ass! I read it cover to cover in about 4 days, googled all of the people mentioned in the book out of sheer fascination, and have run every day since. I have a new appreciation for my Vibram 5 fingers, which I've hiked in- but never ran long distances in. I usually only wear them in the gym for lifting and plyometrics movements.<br /><br />Since getting involved with running in Dec. 2011, I've suffered horrible shin splints- probably due to crappy form and foot strike. I've also dealt with knee pain due to a tight IT Band. The shin splints were growing into stress fractures I'm sure, but I rested and iced, etc. until they felt better. Up until 4 days ago, I was still under the impression that running was one of the worst things you could possible do to your body. I figured the shin and knee pain were hopeless signals telling me to STOP- that I'd never be a runner. After reading 'Born to Run,' I'm convinced that it's not only me who needs to educate myself about running, but our society as a whole. We're under the impression that more is better, when it's actually debilitating. The first thing I did when I had shin splints was buy new, thick soled running shoes. The thought of running in minimal footwear just made me cringe. The shoes were actually great after a few runs, but they didn't eliminate the pain.<br /><br />When people see me wearing my Vibram 5 fingers, sometimes I'll get; \\"You don't run in those do you?!\\" I used to reply \\"no way!\\" But now, with pride, I will say that I do. I ran 5.5 miles on pavement in them the other day and I didn't have one problem, in fact I was able to put more focus on correct foot strike. I'm not saying they don't take some getting used to, they do. But I will never look at barefoot running the same after reading this book, it's definitely changed my life.<br /><br />Beyond all of that, I really enjoyed the story and the writing style. It was a breath of fresh air. I aim to read 1 book every two weeks depending on my work schedule and time constraints, so I read a lot. This book will stay on my mind for months. I couldn't put it down.
B000JIHP88|5.0|many toys state that they are good for 0-xx months however i have found that very few of them are good for 0-2 months - that is not the case with this one!  in the beginning, my daughter loved the music - very soothing and put her right to sleep.  now she is seven weeks old and out of all of the toys we have, this is the only one that she 'plays' with.  she is captivated by the animals going around.  she swats at them, kicks her legs, shakes her arms, squeals, and smiles.  it's really fun to watch!  and, fortunately, the music still puts her to sleep.  it's perfect for over a changing table or a crib.
0345803507|2.0|I'm not sure why I invested the time to read Book 3...the only thing I can think of is that I just wanted some closure.  Well, I could have guessed how this would end.  With the same trite, fantasy ending that has been the dominant force in these books.  The entire story is so predictable, probably because there is so little plot to begin with.  If I had to compare, I would say this book is better than the first, but not as good as the second, although there is not much good to report in any of them.  There is still ridiculous, constant sex, although the S & M has almost diminished (even that was not erotic, but silly).  I thought after the second book that Ana was growing a spine and maybe there would be a little bit of a plot in this last one; but alas....no way.  The writing in Book Three is just as inane and repetitive as the first two (i.e., chewing the lip, instant orgasms, etc.).<br />My daughter told me they are already working on the movies for these books.  If they stick to the books, please tell me how they could possibly make movies of constant sex and e-mails.  That is all there is to the plot....no action whatsoever.  I do have to say that I enjoyed the banter in the e-mails in the first two books, but even they start to get boring in the third.  If they do make a movie, I think they will have to use alot of flashbacks and include more about Christian's childhood to let you inside his head.  The book would have been much more interesting if it has focused there to help us understand his reactions.<br />My biggest complaint about this book (and the other two) is that there is no depth of characters or plot whatsoever.  Everytime they try to include any type of action, it is wrapped up in a matter of minutes with some perfect resolution.  Even the interactions and conflicts (such as they are) between the secondary characters always end with a perfect ending where everybody is happy and cheerful as they ride off into the sunset.<br />I am dismayed by thenumber of people that describe this as good writing.  I realize people have different tastes, but I would never have made it out of ninth grade English class with something like this.  Don't waste your time.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I just got through listening to this remarkable Cd! Rebecca, through her prolific writing and amazing chops, leaves me with little doubt about her life experiences!! Each and every song tugs at your every emotion!! While listening to the melody and the lyrics to \\"Shoulder To Shoulder\\", my eyes weld up as it truely took me to the memories of past loves and nuances of my current love!!! \\"Shoulder To Shoulder\\" will be a single that will hit big world wide. She will be showered with award accolades next year!!
0345803485|3.0|This book was mediocre story-telling drowning in graphic sex. The characters are likeable enough but they cannot be in a room with each other for more than two minutes without having sex. Really? I felt like the constant sex took away from the story and eventually found myself skipping over the graphic descriptions to try and find a plot. The descriptions of S & M did not bother me, I was just looking for a story. If all you want is to read graphic descriptions of sex, this is the book for you! Not my cup of tea.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. The dry sarcasm adds a different element to a steamy novel. This book isn't for those who are embarrassed by sex. Yes, it's erotic and goes into Dominant/Submissive, but it is well done and a very good fiction to take a person away from their every day life. I couldn't put the book down. I can't wait to read the next two books in the trilogy.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Though this probably doesn't mean anything to anyone, I named one of my favorite dogs Seamus after hearing the song on this album.  I also had a dog many years ago (not Seamus but rather Sam) who howled to music, especially guitars.  He especially loved Wishbone Ash's \\"So Many Things to Say (on Wishbone Four) and Led Zeppelin's \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\".  On the Zep song he was so in tune that you could not tell the difference from his yowl to Page's guitar.<br /><br />PS - I also loved all the albums mentioned.

0061692042|3.0|In the novel Canada, the youth Dell grasps at his \\"last best chance\\" but wonders ever after if he's dodged some punishment due.<br /><br />Upon releasing his 10th book of fiction, the American Richard Ford still cuts a fine figure.  By which I refer to the 60,000 sales claimed for his previous novel The Lay of the Land.  Even in the American market, many literary novelists would settle for a fraction of that.<br /><br />As women dominate fiction buying and reading, it must be that women are reading Ford.  And why not?  Sure, he impressed early on with the brisk drugs-and-crime novel The Ultimate Good Luck.  But later came Women With Men.  And his Pulitzer Prize winner Independence Day is a more suburban affair, with shades of John Cheever.<br /><br />Canada I found to have a sharper edge than Independence Day or The Lay of the Land. To some degree, it is a darker and longer reprise of Ford's Wildlife novel.  Each employs the setting of Great Falls, Montana.  In each, a thoughtful teenage observer is disarrayed by a sudden and major family disturbance.<br /><br />The author has retained his urge to tip things off their axis to see what will happen.  No chance for spoiler alerts, not with these first two sentences: \\"First I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\"<br /><br />That's the first of several signals, which serve to silhouette certain misfortunes lurking some pages ahead for the principal players.  This ploy has the reader juggling the narrative tensions of both (to borrow Donald Rumsfeld's slippery remark) known unknowns and unknown unknowns.<br /><br />More so than himself as a younger writer, Ford will get to wherever he's going in his own good time.  Along the way, we should get to know the people, how they look, what they wear, their scents and their personal effects.  The weather and the seasons are to be experienced, the townscapes and the landscapes.<br /><br />For example, Dell as the narrator is soon to concede that the heist was something his father Bev had always itched for.  That his mother Neeva had always owned the weakness that would let her go along with it.<br /><br />But \\"none of this is worth hearing\\" without first displaying the family's normal side.  They are to be seen in their fine summer moments, when \\"the '55 Chevrolet is at the curb in the stalky elm shade under the soft Montana sky\\".<br /><br />Bev pictures himself as a modern man.  He's smart enough to use fancy words like \\"hierarchy\\" and \\"hauteur\\".  He's reckless enough to imagine Dell, not Neeva, as his first-choice accomplice.  This Dell discovers only years afterwards.  But the reader finds out soon after the heist.  Turns out it's another signal, one that is strongly related to events and themes that will only emerge late in the piece.<br /><br />After the robbery, Dell endures a difficult Canadian sojourn.  The key settings there, a real and a derelict township, are rendered just as faithfully as Great Falls.  By way of consolation, the deserted buildings give Dell some sense of starting over.<br /><br />In this part, biblically, men come to trouble as the sparks fly upward.  \\"To say something's founded on a lie,\\" one such man remarks, \\"isn't really alleging that much\\".  Dell's forced to realise that we're all born to deception.<br /><br />\\"Impersonation and deception,\\" so the mature Dell instructs, \\"are the great themes of American literature.\\"  Ford can almost be imagined giving similar counsel at Ole Miss (the University of Mississippi) where recently he took up a chair in English and creative writing.<br /><br />Dell's lesson in literature, nevertheless, looks quite different to his lessons of life.  Life is passed along to us empty, is his conclusion, with hidden meaning all but absent.  He believes in \\"what you see being most of what there is\\".  Which is not so far away from the aphoristic acronym of computing, WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get.<br /><br />(CanberraTimes, June 2012)

1594744769|4.0|Jacob loves his grandfather and is devastated when he dies.  He was brought up on his grandfather's strange stories of the time when he was a resident in Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children off the Welsh coast.  Jacob loved the odd photographs his grandfather used to show him even though he was convinced they had been tampered with and that the stories that went with them were just fairy tales.  When he sees a monster at the scene of his grandfather's death and keeps having nightmares he is taken to see a psychiatrist.<br /><br /> Jacob wants to make a trip from his home in America to the Welsh island to see if he can find Miss Peregrine as she apparently wrote to his grandfather fifteen years ago.  Jacob manages to convince his parents that the trip would be good for him and his father decides to combine it with some bird-watching. When they arrive on the island Jacob starts to wonder where the truth ends and fantasy begins.<br /><br />This is a strange book.  Is it fact?  Is it fiction?  The photographs - created years before computers - are genuine and very strange.  There is nothing horrific about them - no one is dead, there is no violence but they still leave some very disturbing images in the mind of the reader.<br /><br />Even without the photographs this would be a strange story - a blend of the present day and the recent past.  With the photographs - the girl levitating, the man holding a boulder over his head in one hand, the head with a face painted on the back among others - that extra dimension is added to the book which lifts it out of the ordinary.  Is it a book for adults or children?  Some children will love it - others may be disturbed and have nightmares as Jacob did.<br /><br />The book is well written and it is an interesting story prompting thoughts in the reader about the fine line between reality and fantasy.  I found it disturbing and fascinating reading.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|I actually bought the Muppets on DVD this week. I haven't been a Muppet film in probably twenty years. I recall watching a few of the movies and The Muppet Babies cartoon series, but I have lost touch with these cute characters. I remember seeing this movie advertise at the theater last year and I thought it would be horrible due to the fact that Jason Segel is in it. Surprisingly, I wasn't annoyed with his character, even though it is unbelievable that Amy Adams' character actually liked him. All the Muppet characters are back, but some of them could have had more screen time, like Fozzie Bear - who didn't have much to do. The movie is cute for kids with enough humor for adults to enjoy it as well.
B007SGM084|5.0|Entertaining and an easy read. . . All my girlfriends love this book.  It's the talk of the town.  Great summer read.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Last night I watched The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. I haven't read the books, even though I do have them on Kindle, and I haven't seen the Swedish films either. I was shockingly surprised at the brutal violence in the film, and this is coming for someone who is fan of Spartacus on Starz. The movie is well-acted, beautifully filmed, and the dark mystery keeps you watching till the very end.

B004RE29PO|4.0|Suspenseful and terrifying like the original, but in completely different ways. Where Ridley Scott's first film was loaded up with atmosphere, exploration and an overwhelming sense of terrified wonder at the habits of an unfamiliar life form, James Cameron's sequel is faced with the task of expanding upon a theme that's already been fairly thoroughly prodded. Dropping the intellectual angles and dramatic pauses in favor of unbridled, run-and-gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress. While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on-screen world building. The power of the aliens themselves seems very diminished - they're little more than waves of cannon fodder by the second act - but Cameron compensates with a bold determination to examine them as a versatile breed of fauna. Although its dalliances into action tripes can be distracting, and a few lines of dialog are eyeball-spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success. How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate.
B007Q476KU|4.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  I felt the plot was a bit predictable and I anticipated the ending yet it was a feel good movie and I couldn't stop watching.  I didn't expect the relationship between the horses, this was a surprise. I laughed a bit and shed a few tears.  I think it was because it is a story about unconditional love.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Beach Boys have come up with a real gem of an album! Great songs, harmonies and production values are all here. I wish Dennis and Carl Wilson were alive to celebrate, but I know they're smiling somewhere. Really, this album should be called the Beach Boys Renaissance album because its a revival of the distinct sound that turned millions around the globe into Beach Boys fans. This is real music folks....great melodies,layers of vocals and top notch musicianship which are all too rare in an age where synthesized glop and(c)rap pass for music. Don't compare this new albumto any of their previous work and listen without prejudice. You'll be swept up by the listening experience. Also, take a good look at the reviews on Amazon. The general consensus is that T.W.G.M.T.R. is a great album!<br /><br />As a fan who grew up with their music I want to thank the guys for putting the acrimony aside long enough to craft another pop masterpiece.I never thought I'd hear great NEW Beach Boys material. If you love the Beach Boys, please buy (pay)for this album. This cd gives you the full bang for the buck and so much more. It's definitely the soundtrack for my summer of 2012. Surf's up guys, you did it again!

B00007AJF8|5.0|Though I have not watched this gem in some years, still I remember the magitude of the storyline, and now just how appropriate this movie is. Because in this economy, to be an artist, to have any dreams come true at all is truly a miracle. I love the nuances of all the characters, the subtle nonacting, that make each scene a realistic interpretation. And there is just enough whimsicality thrown into the mix that being john malkovich levitates over the ordinary and not just one half floor either.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read everything this author has written. This is by far one of his best works. I hope to find its sequel sometime in the not too distant future. Awesome character development, story line, and plot. Too many reviews on Amazon come across as book reports and reveal parts of the book the readers wish to discover themselves. Save the narrative for your book clubs and discussion boards. In the meantime, from an avid Baldacci reader and also a spy thriller/courtroom drama/who done it junkie--this book is a must read.

006056251X|5.0|I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Lisa Kleypas work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|What starts as a gripping tale degenerates gradually into a somewhat unbelievable story, taking ever more fantastical twists.... not a single sympathetic character to be found... I've loved some of Harris's other works, but I felt a bit cheated by this one.... I've given it 3 stars, as I did want to get to the end to see what happened, although I wasn't really bothered either way....
0380820846|5.0|I recommended to anyone who hasn't read julia quinn work. She is a great author and you won't be disappointed.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I was heartbroken when 24 went off the air. I knew it had to happen sometime, but it didn't make it any easier. This season was definitely great - I don't know why others didn't like it as much as I did, but I have watched the entire series again since 2010 and I was not disappointed. The very last few minutes makes me cry every time!<br /><br />Jack Bauer at his best, all the time. Loved it!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Love this product. It was crazy easy to install, didn't have to look at any instructions. It's sturdy and works perfect for my Dell (PC) laptop. It also has that \\"Mac\\" look to it so from a design perspective it's great. Totally worth the money.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I loved the series \\"Lost\\" and definitely had to buy it because I knew I would end up watching it again (and maybe once again, someday). I was disappointed in the middle of the series that things started seemingly coming from nowhere, and all the way to the ending - I think it could have answered some more of the questions we had for years, but some of the biggest things were never really explained.<br /><br />The first few seasons ramp up to be the most epic show on television, but the final season made me realize I was hoping for too much. I will always love the show, but in my mind the final few minutes could have taken a different turn...
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|With style and voicals similar to Amy Winehouse, Lana Del Ray has a sweet velvety jazz quality.  The album is a seductive anthem, I have yet to find a song I didn't care for, its been a long time since I purchased an entire album.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|It's great!! I listened to Rock n Roll is the Answer at least a trillion times the first day I got it, maybe there's a 12 step program for this addiction??
0061992860|5.0|The book has a lot of useful information. I've noticed a lot of it talks about stuff for certain areas of the world so it's not useful to us in America. If everything for other areas was taken out the book could be a lot shorter than it is. It's just the right size to put in a ziplock sandwich bag to keep it from getting wet in my survival bag.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing from many of my fellow mommy friends how fabulous this book was and that they couldn't put it down I decided to read it.  All I can say is there is much better erotica than this, occasionaly even among the free downloads.  The plot (and I use the term loosely) revolves around an extremely far fetched \\"relationship\\" and this too good to be true man that sounds like a 13 year old girl's vision of Prince Charming, but with a dark side.  The tortured soul, Mr.Grey, is amazingly handsome, wealthy and perfect at everything he does.  Miss Steele is a virgin who decides she is suddenly interested in a Dom/sub relationship and bites her lip ALL the time, which he finds irresistible.  She also has an orgasam at his every touch, which is so frequent I found myself amazed Mr. Grey was in his late 20's and not 16 the way he could perform.  Oops, I just gave the whole book away... I also had serious issues with her subconscious and it's frequent appearance, 77 mentions according to the search count on my Kindle.  Her pom pom waving inner goddess intruded 57 times.  Very poorly written. Don't waste your time or money.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I like to get the faotd or $1-games for my kids. I do NOT like to explain to them why we have to keep paying more to play. Besides, the &quot;reviews&quot; reek of forgery; all use the same phrases and refer to some other game that presumably is more popular...
B0088TG252|5.0|Acting: A+<br /><br />Action: A+<br /><br />Plot: A+<br /><br />Ending: A<br /><br />Very good movie recommend watching with a good surround system.<br />Everything I hoped it would be.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|This is one of my daughter's all time favorite movies.  She likes the story and the characters.  we watched it together and I thought it was a pretty good movie and good for discussion afterwards.  Not a very realistic portrayal of a mental health unit or mental health issues but compassionate.  The main character deals with depression and ends up accepting himself and others as who they are.  A bit of rough language at times and some references to sex but overall a good movie.  The end results of understanding and acceptance of mental health issues and compassion and kindness are good reasons to watch the movie.
030758836X|4.0|Nitpick, nitpick, nitpick....BUT how hard is it for authors to use Google map directions if they are unfamiliar with a region's geography???  I had doubts that Ms. Flynn has ever stepped foot in the state of Missouri, but now have read her bio to see that she is from Kansas City, so what I think now is that she went to Hannibal on a field trip or something as a kid and remembered a little bit about it, maybe knew someone from Ladue so threw that it in. My main complaint is that she places this little fictional town \\"about 40 minutes out of St. Louis\\" and about \\"10-20 minutes\\" for Hannibal and just under 5 hours from Memphis.  Not physically possible.  Hannibal (a real town) is over 100 miles from St. Louis and about 7 hours by car to Memphis, and while I could make allowances for maybe N. Carthage was somewhere in the middle, later in the story, she writes that N. Carthage is north of Hannibal.  Poor details of fact (that are easily searchable and fixable) distract me.  Other geographic details are off too, but would be spoilers, so I'll quit.<br /><br />Having said that, though, could not wait for this to come out based on reviews.  Ran to the bookstore.  Took kids to the pool so I could lounge and read.  Made husband (certainly not a dancing monkey) do dishes and put kids to bed so I could read.  Ignored fact I had to be up at 7 to stay up until 2 to finish this book.  So good.  Laughed out loud.  Loved the angle.  (Was setting up like a Scott Peterson scenario but I knew couldn't be that predictable.)  Unbelievably engaging.  I guessed the outcome but not the motives...whew...what a ride.  Read it in one sitting and DO NOT look at spoilers.<br /><br />Loved the Blue Book gang detail, too.  I teach college classes and am always looking for Blue Books! Way to weave that in.<br /><br />I am new to Gillian Flynn but am heading to the beach next week and think I will pick up the first two books.  I am a hard reviewer and hard to please.  I don't have a lot of time toread, so I get pretty irritated if books don't live up to the hype.  This one does.  Think I will pass it on my husband and keep him guessing. :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Get's interesting quick! Not sure this is any raunchier than Anita Blake vampire series books by Laurel K Hamilton. Bought book two within days!
B0086700CM|5.0|its sucuh a fun game I always play it on the ipad and I have been waiting solo long for it to be on the kindle.it looks weird unbutton its super easy and fun expesally when ur bored out of ur mind!
0393327345|5.0|How can I even put into words how much I love this book?<br /><br />The movie is incredible, and like many others, it led me to the book. I had high expectations going in and was definitely not disappointed. Love everything about Fight Club. I also started reading some of Palahniuk's other books and he's an awesome author in general!
B001MEJY8W|4.0|This movie will makes your worst nightmare seem like a Saturday morning cartoon. The intense suffering of the hapless victims does serve a purpose, but you won't know what it is until the end. You'll need a strong stomach to get even halfway there.  I'd like to put my ex-wife through this.<br /><br />Note:  If you like this one, check out the Human Centipede movies.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is full of heart and compassion, love and caring.  It is a fairy tale--even as a prodigy, what August accomplishes requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but it's a beautiful story wrapped around a wonderful synthesis of musical styles.  It's a story of how music can affect us if we let it, how music can bring us together if we allow it to do so.  August's journey back to his parents is a lovely parable of the importance of passion in our lives, and the willingness to continue a journey even when things look their bleakest.  The acting is top-notch, the script works extremely well, and the characters are finely drawn and work all the way around.  A lovely experience.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is a great pass time game. its so dang addicting!(:  I love it. I'm glad they made this for the kindle. but it is actually easier to handle on ipods.
B0086700CM|4.0|I am so excited it is here.it is basically the same as any other version. it works great except for a very small and rare lag. it is great and love it.
B004LWZW6U|2.0|2010's Piranha 3D was a shockingly entertaining remake that was enjoyable trash on every single level.  With the wonderfully Piranha 3DD, we've got a somewhat entertaining, yet pretty awful sequel.  This time around, a year after the events of the first film, an Arizona water park (run by a delightfully depraved David Koechner) gets overrun with the titular fish beasts.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell, luckily the crew of actors involved (including Danielle Panabaker, Katrina Bowden, Matt Bush, and the returning Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd) throw themselves into the proceedings with reckless abandon.  David Hasselhoff provides some hilarious moments as himself, which in itself becomes a joke that just goes on for way too long, all of which is captured by director John Gulager (Feast) who comes off with some solid moments that are sadly overshadowed by too many cheap scare tactics and some truly awful CGI and green screen effects.  All in all, Piranha 3DD isn't the worst piece of trash you'll come across, but it isn't nearly as enjoyable as the first film.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|Bad storyline, bad character development, shouldn't have been surprised. Collins writes extensively on scenes of little importance to the main storyline, then breezes over the death of key characters in no more than two lines.<br /><br />After a promising book one, the series slowly died a painful death.
0446573019|2.0|I can't believe this book got such great reviews. I'm two-thirds through the thing and I have to force myself to continue just because I spent the money on it! The main character is so obnoxious/dry. The case seems to e going off of assumptions and feels dead with no great leads. I hate when authors try to insert humor and they're terrible at it, none of the characters are the least bit interesting to me, and everyone is just sooo stupid compared to Puller. Cole and her team can't seem to do anything properly, in order to put the self-righteous Puller in the lime-light. Barf. And what was the point of the old lady he saved who ended up dying? Unless someone murdered her, why put her in it. And if she was murdered, why wouldn't Puller already suspect foul play... I'm praying this book becomes great and exciting in the end because right now nothing exiting has happened and the characters are all stupid and annoying. Including Randy, the pouty, bitter younger brother with the headaches. Boohoo. This book is boring.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is really fun I play it a lot and it os addictive so be aware but I love it soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much if you have a lot of spare tome I would recomend it for you
B0086700CM|5.0|awsome no problems at all but the stuff in the shop is alot of money and the things chasing the person might scare younger kids
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a fun game. if u want to exit out of it when you are playing just press the &quot;stuff&quot; button. it is very addicting and fun. :)
B007XH6BPG|5.0|I was so excited to learn that these two giants had \\"teamed\\", I was beside  myself! The songs especially in Hackett's formation in doing albums are always very well done. But with Squire behind him on this recording it was pure heaven. No complaints about any songs! I really wanted to hear more of that \\"Rick\\" sound from Squire,but the energy and the expertise went well beyond any one expectations of a top notch recording. I have heard other \\"masters\\" get  together, but these two created some type of wonderful musical sparks .Just wonderful. Please buy it and listen to it again and again. The import versions have some DVD footage of the making of the great CD! Go to Hackett's site and you can find out more in the special imports. Nice job guys!
0525425764|5.0|As always Grisham has written another page turner.  I would recommend this book for all ages.<br />It is a very good book.
B005LAIHQ8|2.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:<br /><br />I really enjoyed the original Men in Black movie, because it was fresh at the time. We got to discover the Men in Black organization along with the future Agent J.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this sequel really doesn't have anything new to offer. The memory eraser is used over and over again. The aliens among us are still oddball bizarre looking creatures. The only part that was funny was the Andy Warhol character, which only older adults will understand as humorous.<br /><br />Josh Brolin as the young Agent K was somewhat interesting, but if you've seen the first two, you may find this sequel boring.
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever just wach  out for the demon monkeys! :temple run is awesome! you should get it right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:<br /><br />The story is interesting although it's been done before. (It's like \\"Running Man\\" with kids instead of adults.) Also, the way the citizens of the Capitol viewed the Hunger Games as entertainment is similar to the ancient Romans watching gladiators.<br /><br />The things that took away from the movie:<br /><br />1. Shaky camera. It was used to make up for the lack of gore that would normally be seen in a massacre movie. The audience couldn't tell what was really going on in the fight scenes, which is exactly what the producers wanted so a PG-13 rating could be put on the movie as the target audience is that age group.<br /><br />2. Lacked character development. As the characters get killed, no empathy emerges, because the audience hasn't been given much background on anyone except Katniss.<br /><br />3. It does have some implausible moments such as computer generated beasts being able to attack and kill.
1602835004|5.0|Rebecca is my favorite book and movie of all time, so I had high hopes when I purchased the audio book.  I'm so glad it was unabridged since I relished every word from narrator Anna Massey.  Her interpretation and reading were flawless.  I limited myself to one disc a day to stretch it out as long as I could.  If you are a lover of the 20s-30s time period and English authors, you will love this story.  Daphne duMaurier's descriptions and plot build-up are unmatched.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very sexy and moving. How to deflower a female in the most gentle way and to also make it pleasureable.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is soooo FUN!I was surprised how cool it was and impressed on how it helps you learn. I hope many people will play this game!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. it is very entertaining and easy to earn points to buy different items for your game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never written a review before, but I felt I had to write something about this book.  It was nice to read something with a new plot and new twists.  The book had me hooked from chapter 1 all the way to the end.  I'm getting ready to read part 6.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I Was intrigued enough to purchase 3 volumes for my iPad, however I have never been spellbound & truly skimmed over the explicit and \\"adventuristic\\" pleasure & punishment sections. I have enjoyed  when  the characters show growth, both in terms of maturation & healing but have a personal aversion to control freaks.  Over-all, not my best series choice.
B005OK722U|4.0|Why is everyone hating on this movie?!?! These films are the next bext thing to the Saw films. This installment is just as great as the first two films. I like the whole less excluded factor of this film and how it was turned into a casino game was really awesome! This movie has one expected twist and an ending you won't see coming. I hope they will do another film, because this film had me begging for more!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game it gives you a sense of responsibality. I play pet shop story, city story and resturant story. THESE GAMES ARE AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B005LAIH3G|1.0|When I heard that John Carter of Mar was a flop, I thought how could this be? Here is a group of eleven books that a large group of fans read once, twice, three or more times. Then I saw the movie. The director/ writer tried to cover all the books in one movie. As I watched it, I would say this is not in the books. Then a part would stray back into the story and I would hope it would stay there. E. G. B. was a great writer and as one person stated, we will never see a second try at doing this movie. In trying to update the story line, the story line was destroyed. Disney just allowed a cash cow bigger than Pirates of the Caribbean to slip through their hands and in the process deprive the fans of John Carter the joy of seeing the images that formed in their minds while they read John Carter of Mars, which was the last, to  be transformed to big screen.
B0072QPV6I|1.0|I've stopped watching it after 15 min. and there are no words to express disappointing. Picture is a matter of taste  but sound...  is just disgusting, flat and bassless. Seems like this BD was created from some fan's handy phone record dowloaded from YouTube. Wasted money.
B0086700CM|5.0|hi how are you doing this app sucks balls cuz its so amazing you  should play it cuz its awww mazing
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|Az of the game it self I would rate it 4 stars but when you buy an app their shouldnt be any inapp purchses at all or make it free with inapp purch. As of the game their should be difficulty levels like easy, mediam, hard, expert, and legendary.
B0002VFXFE|1.0|If you are buying a processor it will come with thermal grease. That is good enough.<br />Don't get ripped off...this will not make your processor run any cooler at all. Invest your<br />money in a good heat sync. That will help 1000% better then high priced thermal grease.
0345803485|5.0|SCORCHING HOT! Bravo EL James. You are giving us exactly what we want!!!! More please, and hurry! Shame on all the literary geniuses who appeared overnight just because of a little sex. Let the ladies have what we want...more!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like how there are several images per theme, and many free themes.  It can go from beginner to master and you get the option to have the pieces rotate or not. Nice for passing the time.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome love it. definitely download.<br />I mean it lags a little bit but not really unless you trip or something.
B0086700CM|3.0|Well I've played this on a friends ipod before and wouldn't give it back it was so addicting!!! I looked it up on the kindle store and they didn't have it. But now they do!! I was so happy, but it lags alot, but it's still fun, I guess!!
B0026P3G12|1.0|I played it once and it was awful Her voice was strained and she seemed nervous. Her vocals were off and I think maybe she is a one hit wonder with I Dreamed a Dream. Sorry.
B002RSDWF8|5.0|Moby successfully joins ambient and gospel music to create a sound that is both spiritual and profound. As always, the tracks ebb and flow into one another. Disc 1 contains the fantastic originals, and disc 2 is comprised of ambient versions of disc 1. Disc 3 holds some excellent live performances on DVD. Well worth the purchase!
B005HSL626|4.0|I don't see what's so bad about it and there's not that many adds.<br />The only thing that gets on my nerve's is that my finger<br />starts to hurt after awhile. :D
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my all time favorite game!!!!! I love it. Its super addicting! The most ive gotten on it is two million something
1848566980|4.0|Amongst the 580 pieces displayed, 342 are sized ¼ of a page or smaller. It's a shame really, because at least a half of those are 4 or 5 star pieces worthy of a full page.<br /><br />In order for the rating not to be biased I opted not to include those 342 images in the rating.<br /><br />SPECIFICS:<br />Page Count: 240<br />Number of images: 580<br />Small images: 342<br />Half page images: 162<br />Full page images: 64<br />2-page spreads: 12<br />BW images: 3<br /><br />TEXT:<br />Introduction: 8 pages<br />Foreword by Moebius - 1 page<br />Foreword by Alejandro Jodorowsky - 1 page<br />Title and year for each piece<br /><br />ART:<br />48 images: 5 stars<br />116 images: 4 stars<br />74 images: 3 stars<br />0 images: 2 stars<br />0 images: 1 star<br /><br />Overall:  3,5 Stars
B005EI86JU|4.0|Concise, well organized and easy to navigate. It has some comprehensive chapters like the ones pertaining to functions or focusing. The video section could use a more in depth explanation. The chapter on focusing is useful and thorough. There is the need for more graphic and or video content to support various points. The author recommendations are a solid starting point. Overall, this book is easy to read and comprehensive
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game....i love how you can cook different foods... i love this game. i think they should have more types of foods.. better than bakery story.
B0086700CM|5.0|This title is fun for the whole family. I have never played a game that makes you jump more that Mario bros.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|it was awesome I was at wave 32 but it erased my profile and now I have to start at the begining
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I wish there were more books out there like this one. It has truly been years since I found a book I enjoyed enough to read and then re-read in less than 3 days. The last book I fell in love with as much as I now love this one was Double Standards by Judith McNaught which came out years ago. Heart warming, heart-breaking, and throughly enjoyable. Long after I read the book I still think about Travis and Abby.  I can't wait to see what the author comes up with next!
B00846TRHY|5.0|I had hoped to see this in theaters in my area but it never was released here.  Not for kids, this movie keeps it real when it comes to the life of a biker and drug addict who came to Christ for help.  .
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great app, not to mention that is is free on the Amazon App Store!<br /><br />Highly addicting as I'm always trying to beat my previous or even unlock the difficult achievements they have.<br /><br />Graphics on this application look great for a tablet game, would recommend.
0307716546|5.0|I love a good murder mystery and I certainly got that and a whole lot more in the novel Afterwards by Rosamund Lupton. I had read Lupton's first novel, Sister, and thoroughly enjoyed it for the unique plotting, page turning prose and a terrific gut punching twist at the end. But I digress.<br /><br />Afterwards is Lupton's second book and I found it just as uniquely crafted as Sister but in a whole different way. Told by the disembodied spirits of a mother and daughter, victims of an arsonist, this book could go campy right away, but in the capable hands of Lupton the reader somehow manages to accept the storytellers and just get on with trying to solve the mystery.<br /><br />Grace and Jenny, the mom and teenage daughter, are both in comas due to the traumatic injuries they've suffered in a fire at the school where Jenny is working and where Grace's other child Adam is still a student. The reader must suspend belief when Grace and Jenny leave their bodies and find each other in the hallways of the hospital. It is through Grace's watchful spirit that the story unfolds and we the readers get to observe as the identity of the arsonist and the motive are revealed.<br /><br />I can see how some readers may feel the novel is gimmicky, but I think Lupton is such a readable author with such a fluid narrative style that I would emphatically disagree. There are so many books that I pick up that feel like drudgery to complete, but not so with Rosamund Lupton. Even though she only has two books under her belt, she is one of my favorite authors.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|While this release has generated some sound and fury from Neil Young die-hards, great artists will continue to play and explore, and I'm grateful for that. Negatives don't interest me.<br /><br />While I wouldn't have chosen half-the items on the set-list, such as \\"Oh Susannah,\\" \\"Clementine\\" and \\"God Save the Queen,\\" Young and his band have so transformed these (for the better) that lyrics are the best clue we have to the source material.  Other renditions of songs such as \\"Get a Job,\\" High Flyin' Bird\\" and \\"Wayfarin' Stranger,\\" are more recognizable; but the electricity Crazy Horse lends this material transforms it again in a thoughtful way.<br /><br />I've listened to the album three times, and the only bomb is \\"God Save the Queen.\\" I don't know why it's here. As for the rest, it's interpreted and performed by Young and the Band we know in the way we expect.  The enclosed mini-booklet is beautifully produced, and in an era in which cheap paper sleeves have prevailed, Warner has exercised superb quality control.<br /><br />Thew sonics are big, bold and satisfying.  Not a wall of sound -- which is a good thing.  I prefer to hear the individual pieces in the band, and indeed I do.<br /><br />As one who eschews the total junk big corporations have distributed to the public these days -- the public's problem more than anyone's, I'd be the first to complain if I thought Young had pandered to me, but I don't think he has.<br /><br />The lions of Americana are aging, and the songs they discovered and encoded are what they've behind. They continue to grow and change. I view this album as a tribute to that process. I add my praise to all this recording has received, and my regrets to those who expect our best artists to remain static and unchanging.<br /><br />A safe bet for fans of the Neil Young/Crazy Horse Band -- but also for lovers of roots music and Americana.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book out of curiosity, having heard that it was not great but had become wildly popular. I've come away from the experience confused.<br /><br />It's terrible. Really terrible. The plot is pure wish fulfillment for the simple-minded. The writing is bland, repetitive and inelegant and I wouldn't want to have coffee with a single one of the characters, much less copulate with one.<br /><br />Seriously, folks.  This book is not worth the time or money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome! I haven't had and lagging issues or anything thus far. it id s great time passer, if I could change anything it would be that when you unlock a new character, they should have different abilities. i.e. longer jumps, faster speeds... things like that.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Mass market paperback bundle is $20.50; Kindle edition is $29.99.  I would love to read these books, but I don't want a paper version, and I'm not going to pay an extra ten dollars for the privilege of reading electrons.  Not gonna happen.  Publisher:  extract your head from where you presently have it ensconced.  You'll find the world a brighter place.
B007KAJG3K|3.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS isn't a necessary film.  Okay?  The first SHERLOCK HOLMES was more than enough: a fun film that got decidedly less appealing the more you watched it (don't ask me how or why, but I saw it three times in theaters alone, so I know of what I speak).  But of course, the first film made enough money, and had built-in franchise appeal, so you knew a sequel was coming.<br /><br />And here it is.  Holmes and Watson are taking up their ultimate arch-enemy, the thoroughly evil Professor Moriarty.  He's Holmes's equal in all capacities, both physical and mental.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Moriarty was a shadowy entity; the one here is, by necessity, more transparent, though actor Jared Harris gives it his all (the script is at fault here, not the actor).  Back in the lead roles, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law keep their chemistry intact; if nothing else, watch this film for the camaraderie between the two, it remains a highlight.  In supporting roles, Noomie Rapace, Amy Adams, and especially Stephen Fry give it their all, creating likable characters that we can relate to, if not entirely believe.<br /><br />Overall, the film seems kind of lazy.  It takes a few chances early on (nothing too shocking, but stuff that you wouldn't necessarily expect a blockbuster film to do), and the climactic moment is a nice ode to the stories (and, just breaking it down, a good scene), but we're still left with the feeling: so what?  SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is a fun time, definitely, but it's not something you'll want to watch as often as the first film.  Maybe because Guy Ritchie and company are merely repeating themselves?  Maybe Downey, Jr. and Law could go off and do another film together.  They are easily the best things here--two great actors enjoying themselves and their time together.

1607882302|3.0|Tony Hsieh is a very smart and very rich man.  As an occasional customer of Zappos, I decided to read his book.  His focus on quality and building a corporate culture made sense, but in the end I was left with three puzzles:<br /><br />* His writing is extremely opaque.  Any people he mentions are like cardboard figures - father, mother, partner - he never tells anything personal about any person.  Once in the book he mentions \\"my significant other\\" but nothing who that person might be and what they are like.  Seems friendly but tells you nothing<br />* In describing the sale of Zappos to Amazon he says that announcing a 40% bonus to employees let to a mass celebration by people who would now be able to take their kids to Disneyland or afford a medical procedure.  Hello, Mr Benefactor of Humanity and the carrier of happiness - what about health insurance and pay levels?  People who work for you have to wait for a once-in-a-decade bonus to afford medical care?<br />* The bonus chapter in the audiobook contained a long interview.  While advertised as spontaneous, major chunks of it were word-for-word repeats of the book, creating an impression that the author has a script that he keeps repeating as he crafts his public image.<br /><br />Something in that whole story did not fit.  While I do not regret having read this book, I'm left puzzled...
B0086700CM|5.0|oh how i love this app. it runs great and keeps u busy for hours. it can be challenging at some points and u can buy power ups and everything!  i luvvvvvs it!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|JJ really went all out with this CD and I am more than impressed. I've been a big fan of his since In Between Dreams came out and this album is my favorite of his by far.<br /><br />He incorporates electric guitar into quite a few songs, which really spices things up for him, and his lyrics (as always) are catchy & heartfelt.<br /><br />I have never skipped a song on this album and I never will. I have listened to it straight through more than a few times a week for the past 9 months.<br /><br />Well done, Jack.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run and I have been waiting for it on the kindle fire! I have played it on my friends iphone 4!! I love it!! :)
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This is the best app I've gotten from the amazon appstore it is so fun. it is also extremely difficult. ( not good for people who rage quit:-) ) so worth the .99 cents it cost. I love this app I got it today and haven't put it down I've been playing for hours, amd a great way to pass time if you're waiting or on a road trip
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an awesome app with hours of challenging puzzles and fun with cards. Enjoyable for all ages, but some are challenging.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|current update shuts down the game. don't like the fact the game is not totally free. -however I love this game.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|If you like Neil Young & Crazy Horse's sloppy jams, then pick up this album.  The band is rocking, loose, and free.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Nice story. This book has the power to hold the reader as to want to read more and more.<br /><br />When I started to read it, I could not even imagine what was going to happen and I loved the way the author is describing all the things regarding The Hunger Games.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is a awesome game and I think that all kids and adults would love this game so play this game and see if you like it and just saying but you will.
B006ZCWTXS|4.0|British X-Factor finalist Rebecca Ferguson's debut effort [[ASIN:B006ZCWTXS Heaven (US Bonus Track Version)]] materializes in the United States in 2012; it first appeared in the U.K. In 2011.  The album is a neo-soul affair, with pop sensibility, that well suits the gritty, soulful Ferguson.  Ferguson possesses a strong, captivating presence throughout the eleven tracks of Heaven, always remaining in `good' voice, even when some material is less alluring than other material.  Overall, Heaven proves to be an interesting and compelling debut.<br /><br />\\"Nothing's Real But Love,\\" produced/co-written by Eg White, opens Heaven soulfully with a roots-driven, neo-soul sound, owed to the use of organ, drums, and acoustic guitar.  Ferguson possesses an incredibly gritty voice with more than enough charisma to sell the opener.  The songwriting is notable, particularly on the refrain in which Ferguson sings: \\"And nothing's real but love/nothing's real but love/no money, no house, no car, can be love...\\" \\"Glitter and Gold\\" again highlights the smoky nature of Ferguson's voice.  The cut sounds indigenous to the 1970s, but not so much so that it is an anachronism in 2012. Supporting background vocals accentuate Ferguson's stunning lead, further making the chanteuse shine.<br /><br />\\"Shoulder to Shoulder\\" is characterized by big thudding drums demarcating beats one and three (the strong beats).  Ferguson's voice continues to draw the listener in, particularly as she performs the refrain: \\"And we fight and we cry/and we tell the same lies about love/and we cling to each other's shoulder to shoulder against the world...\\" \\"Fairytale (Let Me Live My Life This Way)\\" continues the vintage soul scheme through-and-through, yielding some of the strongest production of the alum.  Ferguson is on autopilot here, delivering perhaps her most commanding vocals of the entirety of the effort.  Production-wise, the big drums and groove are a selling point.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Bright Eyes,\\" produced by Xenomania is as vintage as things go. Characterized by the rhythmic guitar chords on beats two and four and loud live drums, \\"Mr. Bright Eyes\\" would have been a perfect choice for the late, great Amy Winehouse or Etta James.  The loudness of the vocals recalls 1950s R&B and rock-n-roll where `shouty' vocals where characteristic of the style.  \\"Fighting Suspicions,\\" another Eg White co-write/production,  proves to be a bit `all-over-the-place.' The cut takes an unsurprising change of pace early on, around the :50 mark.  There are some nice musical moments, but the cut does not feel as well conceived as previous ones.  Vocally, Ferguson concedes no momentum, continuing to sing her heart out.<br /><br />\\"Teach Me How to Be Loved\\" is a better cut, continuing to allow Ferguson's voice to shimmer in grace.  The sole quibble of \\"Teach Me How To Be Loved\\" might be that the cut could use more `direction' and accompaniment to make it more interesting and suspending to the listener.  \\"Run Free\\" marks an `upswing' for Heaven, delivering a sound cut with driven groove, clear vocals, and a well penned refrain.  The production here is less steeped in `soulful' vocal production, which gives this cut a slightly `cleaner' sound.<br /><br />\\"Diamond to Stone\\" continues the overall allure of Heaven yielding a soulful, relatively catchy cut.  Penultimate cut \\"Too Good To Lose\\" is a winner, providing Ferguson with a more modern flare.  There is still a soul about the cut, but the more contemporary sound appeals to a younger demographic.  Bonus cut \\"Backtrack\\" is solid, with a driving, soulful production.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B006ZCWTXS Heaven (US Bonus Track Version)]] is a solid debut from the X-Factor contestant.  There are no overt misses and Ferguson's vocals always remain solid and soulful.  Highly recommended debut effort overall.y Xenomania is as vintage as things go.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a addicting game and I say that almost everybody would love this game so try it out and see how you would like it my whole family loves this game so just try it out.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|eh... I said it all in my title. there is nothing else I would say that would make this game cooler.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|yo its good real real good like and all yo wish pet sake Saki well that's it really hoe down h
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app with many translations. the app is my Bible at church and I use it on my phone and tablet.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|a bit hard to get glu credits but otherwise I'm surprised its free great game you should definately add it
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|Sheesh! Real problems with this one!<br />Strike One!<br />~ Open Feint surreptitiously installed. Not cool.<br /><br />Strike Two!!<br />~ Asking (telling) me to pay for additional game content. Apparently a tactic to disguise poor game design.<br /><br />Strike Three!!!<br />~ Padding the ratings with false reviews. It's not as if this doesn't happen (just as strike 1 and strike 2 also happen with regularity), but it seems particularly egregious given that it is a) so obvious, and b) readily combined with strike 1 and strike 2, all in the same app!<br />Wow. Too bad the least I can give is one star. You'd do well to avoid this app (and this developer).<br />You Are Out!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game ever in the entire world i would give up the rest of my games foe this game
B007ARJF6G|1.0|Let me start by saying I DO NOT LIKE MADONNA but I find it surprising that she can't sell CD's when her tours are selling out. That's crazy to me. I think it because the quality of music don't fit her age; its a turn off to younger people that a 53 year old is singling teenage songs and a BIG turn off to the older fans who is now her age or a bit younger. Yes Madonna successfully transformed her image but failed to transform her music:) Try again Marge!
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game can play it for hours. like how its not the same course every time ax well. everyone should own it lol
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game.  Good graphics, levels and gameplay. not really a whole lot to complain about. cant beat it for free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's cooler than Mario racing games!<br />it's like 100% awesome you are this leprechaun trying to find your gold<br />AND you get to shoot all the dumb bugs with pinecones
B007HO392S|5.0|I didn't want to wait an extra 7 weeks to buy the album in the UK so I pre-ordered the CD from Amazon.com and paid for expedited postage. I could have bought the MP3 download, but still like to have a CD. It was well worth it. The UK version has 4 extra tracks, but these are from Carrie's previous albums, which I already have, so I'm not missing those by buying the US version. Blown Away has hardly been out of the CD player in the car in the 4 weeks or so that I have had it, and the family love it too. The first three tracks seem to stand out, being a bit more pop/rock and maybe these might get her some more airplay in UK and a bit more notice. At the moment Carrie is only playing one date in UK, in June, but hopefully she'll tour at some point. Best album I've bought in a long while.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|loooooove it!<br />it' so cool! I've never seen anything like it!Everybody that hates it doesn't know what the're talking about.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great you can play for hours and not get tired of it!!! its such a great game and woo worth it!!!

B00846TTDG|5.0|this move was great.... I am proud to know that men and women are here for us no matter the job. We are all blessed to have our military. spent 11 years active and force reduced, however my patriotic heart remains.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|in app purchases r for the birds... same as dlc... what happen to buyin a game n that was that u could just play it.. now u gotta pay more just to play what uve already bought... shame
B003NOMHGK|3.0|This episode had so much potential, but it just turned into a ridiculous mess.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />Since when does a fish commit suicide by jumping into water?<br /><br />Hope Matt Smith gets better.  He's not horrible so far, but he's just not selling the genius, experienced Time Lord role yet.  I miss David Tennant!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What is the big deal with this book? After reading the first two chapters I'm totally confused; what made this a great read and makes everyone so \\"excited\\"? The writing is bad, the story line is childish and the characters are outrageously unbelievable. Can I get my money back? I mean really! I am just amazed at the publicity this book has received from all ages of women including Barbara Walters when it's so juvenile and uncomprehending. And it's a TRILOGY???? WOW!!! The gullibility of some people. Do I really have to give it a star? Then add a negative star in front of the one I had to choose because this book sucks!!
B001MTENOC|4.0|I am finging this book to be very interesting and believable, expecially in consideration of other information regarding souls that I have recently read.  It's an easy read and the author seems very credible to me.
B006JD48NM|5.0|A very good look into the life of Aryton Senna, with great behind the scene footage and interviews.  A look into the life of one of the most charasmatic F1 drivers ever.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ok, you know that awesome chase scene in an action movie where the guy/girl is running away from monsters or something? This game is nothing but that AWESOME CHASE SCENE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is really addicting and fun. FIVE STARS BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|It has the bet photos of all the Puzzles Ive worked with.  It has a learning curve of about 10 minutes but it is worth it._
0345803507|5.0|This book just pulls you into a world a bit naughty, a bit dangerous, and a whole lot of sexy. I found myself holding my breath in anticipation of what was going to happen next. It is a must read!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is so much fun playing temple run my favorite character is Montana Smith go temple run?

B002BU0DPE|5.0|Bought these after being recommended by a friend. After using them for 1 day, I realize that these are amazing. Clear sound, plenty of controls, I'd recommend these to true gamers
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert outdid himself on this album.  Electrofunk dance beats with hints of Queen, Michael Jackson, and Prince; mid-tempo songs that soar; ballads that almost break my heart.  His vocal ability is quite simply mind-blowing!  One of the best male vocalists of our time.<br /><br />Every time my 9 year-old gets in the car, he insists I put this CD in so he can \\"dance in his seat.\\"<br /><br />Standouts:  Trespassing, Shady, Kickin' In, Pop That Lock, Underneath, Broken English, Nirvana.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|***Update***:  This app also has OpenFeint.  Turn off your internet connection and you will get the OpenFeint offline message when you start this app.  That would account for the huge data usage I mentioned at the bottom of my review.  So, this app connects us to OpenFeint and doesn't even tell us.  Is it also creating OpenFeint accounts for our devices?  I'm guessing this issues will change this app from a disliked app to a hated app.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Too bad, I was going to rate this app high.  But I have to agree with the other reviewers here that this app is an example of pure greed.  Paying again for something you already had?  Really?  If it was a free game, then the in-app purchases would be justified.  But it's not a free game!  A paid app should be a total app--you should get all the functionality, all the bells and whistles, all the time--you shouldn't have to pay again to play the game the same way you did when you first bought it.<br /><br />The In-App purchases are:<br />$0.99 for 5 more Shields after you used up the initial 10.  (Which doesn't even get you back to the original 10.)<br />$0.99 for 5 more Slowmotions after you used up the initial 10.  (Again, only half of what you started with.)<br />$1.99 to unlock the Rescue level of the Story mode, if you don't want to complete the Run level first.<br /><br />But here's a helpful hint (if you don't mind wiping out your scores): if you clear the apps data section, the initial 10 Shields and 10 Slowmotions will be restored.  (Hey, a way to stick it to the man--or the developer in this case.  LOL)<br /><br />It's too bad really because it's not a bad game.  Its graphics are crisp and move very smoothly.  The controls are responsive and the gameplay is actually fun.  Though, there were a few times when the app did quit without prompting with the Exit (No/Yes) screen first, which was irritating.<br /><br />The multiplayer mode is a bit silly, especially on phones.  Though, I would think itwould be pretty tough to play on a Kindle as well--can you really see 4 guys huddled around that device madly tapping on the screen?<br /><br />And the description is wrong.  There are only two game modes, not three (Story and Endless).  There is no \\"Practice\\" mode.<br /><br />As a side note, the data usage is sort of sucky: even after moving this app to the SD card it still uses 1.23MB of internal storage.  And after playing just a little, data usage is 5.70MB (a total of 6.93MB).<br /><br />To summarize: Greed wrecks a good app.
B0086700CM|5.0|My cousin recommend this game to me, and I'm really happy she did! I haven't been able to put it down ever sense it came to the kindle app store! It's seriously great!
B00846F1YW|4.0|If I hadn't read reviews on this game, I would still be stuck trying to re-arrange the wiring in the limited amount of time, tried over 30 times, getting very frustrated. Then read review and found I could take off time clock. This a good game after all!
B000I9X54Q|5.0|Excellent! Cant wait to see the next movie!Loads of action in this movie. A must see if you have seen the other movies.
0470424702|3.0|I bought the book for my MBA finance class, a typical textbook. Very dry contents and boring. Nothing much to say.

B0001MLMKY|4.0|I like it straight & simple and this black & white model is just the ticket.  The Swatch is a great solution for those of us wanting function without the bling, and still we get some classy looks.  The bands crack up way before it stops ticking.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Objects are hard but not impssible to find. just a hidden object game. I was getting tired of looking for hidden paths and rooms. do not like that new twist.

B005FITIF0|5.0|First I heard of this was on Becoming the Archetype's website, about a controversial movie dealing with a controversial preacher (as he said in the movie, \\"He's got a price on my head? I must be doing something right.\\"). Right then, I knew I had to check this out. Good move.<br />You ever hear someone scoff at a Christian and say that God can't use them because of their past? Sam Childers could be a good example of that kind of thought, only he didn't use that thought. Getting out of jail for dealing drugs, the biker finds out his ex-stripper wife has accepted Christianity and, beinglike Lee Strobel before becoming a Christian, challenges that notion. But it takes a tripper after some drug use for him to reconsider. Reluctantly (VERY reluctantly, almost a la C.S. Lewis-esque) accepting Jesus, he decides to use a useful skill of his (construction) to build a new area for orphans. Then he goes north and hears about this \\"Christian\\" warlord, Joseph Kony, and decides to help the orphans even further. Only every time he tries to help, he gets attacked. More and more brutally every time. Over time (not sure how many years, but it goes from when his daughter's a young girl to being a high school student), he starts losing his mind. Losing his faith in God after his best friend dies a tragic death. Losing his family after his narrow-minded focus on the finances \\"required\\" for the orphans compared to our financial standards here. Losing his spiritual standing in his church. Essentially, losing everything that holds dear to him. Inevitably, though, he, like Job in the Bible, does get a few things back.<br />Last Christian movie I saw that was this hardcore, raw, real, extreme, etc. was The Book of Eli, and for me, just as enjoyable.<br />If not also as devastating.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its sexy, disturbing, tender, romantic, and messed up all in one. People have issues with it because of the alternative lifestyle depicted- SO- This book is not for those who are weak stomached or closed minded. People who are more sexually adventurous or open minded will love it. I loved it and read the entire 3 book series over about 2 weeks because I couldn't put the books down. The story progresses well, and has a very satisfying ending- but basically what you've got is a man who was horribly abused as a child who can't stand a loving human touch as a result- and he finds this woman who amazes him- and through their relationship he begins to change and learns to love a different kind of touch rather than the BDSM one he was taught to like as a child. He still has a kinky side, but the violence goes away and what you're left with is an incredibly loving, tender, intimate relationship that makes me jealous. Don't give up when the scenes are hard to read- just keep going and know that its part of a journey that ends in a beautiful, loving life.

0143034545|5.0|I purchased this book a while ago when I first started learning about GTD. Had I read it right after reading [[ASIN:0142000280 Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity]] I probably would not have found it as valuable, as the discussion makes more sense once you've tried to use GTD. This book helps you to understand the values behind GTD and serves as inspiration to use the GTD process with more discipline. While the book is a compilation of newsletter articles, it has been edited and assembled to make a coherent whole. The chapters can be read one at a time or in a couple of sittings. I recommend the former, as taking the time to think about each item will make it more valuable. My one minor annoyance about the book was the use of inspirational quotations in each chapter. While they support the points in the chapters, they are also somewhat distracting, but not enough to make this book any less valuable. If you've used GTD and need to be motivated to be better at it, get this book.

B003V5CFV8|1.0|I really, really like the Cohen Bros., but I really, really hated this film.  Watching it was like chewing ice cubes while being run over by a really slow steamroller.  Trust me, I understand what the Cohen boys were trying to do with this movie, but I also understand what Facebook was trying to do when they IPO'd at a $110 billion market cap.  Failure is failure, regardless of past perception.<br /><br />In short, this film is a mess; and a mess that is so long that the best part of it is the closing credits because then you know it's actually over.  You'll never get that time back, but it's over.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Easy to play but not too easy. great graphics, sound, story and twists. Totally worth the cash.

0553582038|2.0|I got hooked into the Game of Thrones series and read the first 3 books relatively quickly.  I will say that I not necessarily a great sword and sandals - fantasy kinda guy, but loved the first 3 books.  I also enjoyed the HBO adaptation that I watched streaming on Amazon.  But this book....  not so much.  I am a pretty bright IMHO and an avid reader, but I can honestly say after reading almost half of this book, I have no friggin' idea what is going on.  There!  I said it! Perhaps reading short snippets on my commute train is the problem.  Or maybe the e-reader is not the best way to go.  Either way, I might as well start the book again....  OMG!  The horror! Because folks, I ain't gettin' it.  I just ordered Bradybury's Martian Chronicles and may have an extended interlude from the Game of Thrones.  Hopefully, with fresh eyes, it will start to click with me.  Cheers and happy reading!  Your pal, Keith
B003OTLVBG|5.0|this limited release SHM-SACD is as good as all of the reviews i have previously read. Although, not many reviews note that this is a 2 channel SACD layer ONLY disc. This means that it will not play on anything but a SACD capable player. With that said, this SHM-SACD is miles ahead of any of the other releases that are out there.<br /><br />It is expensive but for me it was worth it to have this great release by Sabbath.<br /><br />It would be nice to have more high resolution in the US as we keep getting passed up on all of recent releases such as this.

0553386794|3.0|This novel is divided in independent chapters, each one related to what is going on in the plot around a chosen character following simultaneous timelines, these characters return time and again, later on The novel is very long, nothing wrong about that, but when the author makes one meaningful development in the beginning and goes uneventful at a somewhat dull pace for the next 600 pages and then gets back to the meaningful twists and turns over the last 100 pages in preparation for the sequels, I as a reader, feel a bit disappointed<br />The positive is the colorful graphic and sensuous narrative intended to give way to our imagination in many situations, this feature comes with many sparks of excellence, indeed another liability is the presentation of a very long complex array of characters and places, there are so many names and last names that at one time you do not know if  is a friend or foe, uncle or father, wife or sister, Jon's pets or Bran's pet, you mention it  For the most part, I am not looking forward to read the sequels, I think the author focused mostly on his work but forgot the interests of the readers as consumers.

B000002MU2|5.0|I was glancing through reviews of this album and ALL of the poor ones said things like \\"I've listened to them since the beginning and this sucks!\\" or \\"It's not the R.E.M that I grew up with...\\" or \\"It's their lame attempt at cashing in on grunge!\\" or most especially \\"They should've broken up after AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE!\\". While I understand that music, like all art, is subjective, I can't fathom the \\"fans\\" that don't see anything of value on an album that has some of their best songs ever. After the one-two mega-success punch of OUT OF TIME and AUTOMATIC, R.E.M knew that they were pretty much on top of the world. They were all over the radio; they were all over MTV (For you young people, MTV actually stands for Music Television, and they used to play lots and lots of music!); and they were about to tour all over the world. To be totally honest, after their massive success, if they decided to tour based on the work of OUT OF TIME and/or AFTP and continue with smaller venues, it would have been a colossal mistake. They were about to become arena rockers. They needed a rock and roll album that fit their aesthetic.<br /><br />That idea of a R.E.M Arena Rocker Album is what gave birth to MONSTER. Out of this album, not only was there a distinctly different sound in contrast to the flowing melodies of OUT OF TIME and sorrowful tone of AFTP, there was also a distinctly different look to the band. Michael came out, head shaved to the scalp with a greater spring in his step and a Elvis-pelvis, but Mike also came out in amazingly hilarious glam-rock leisure suits (all of them the same, except the color). These were no longer the shy post-collegians with their art-rock style; this was an R.E.M we had never seen before and certainly hadn't heard before.<br /><br />From the most anthemic opening to an R.E.M album that has ever existed with \\"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?\\" to the Sonic Youth/Iggy and The Stooges-influenced fuzz-ridden \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" to the loin-straining \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" to the hard pounding pulse of \\"Star 69\\" to the brightly melodic \\"Strange Currencies\\" to the tragic and erotic imagery of \\"Bang and Blame\\" to the drunken torch-song piano lyricism of \\"Tongue\\" to the crazy angry distortion of \\"I Took Your Name\\" to the epic fuzziness of \\"Circus Envy\\" to the rhythmic, sexually-charged finale of \\"You\\", it's a pretty amazing album from start to finish.<br /><br />You might have noticed there were two songs I didn't include: \\"King of Comedy\\" and \\"Let Me In\\". \\"King of Comedy\\" is an interesting enough indictment of celebrity-personal-life-as-entertainment, but musically, it's pretty weak. That's okay, though. Even on the very best albums, there's usually one weak song. \\"Let Me In\\" I didn't include because that song deserves its own paragraph.<br /><br />This album was released in late September of 1994. Just a few months before, many of the youth and many of the creative minds of the time were devastated to learn that Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, the adoptive father of the Gen-X zeitgeist, had killed himself. Not long before, Michael Stipe had spent time with Kurt and his widow Courtney Love of the bourgeoning riot-grrl band Hole, and they had all become good friends, but there was something that Michael saw in Kurt, which was a deeply-felt pain. After all, both Michael and Kurt had, in many ways, the de facto poster boys of this movement of \\"Alternative Rock\\" that killed the hair-metal pop/rock of old and they were both forced into a much more public existence. While Michael had much more time to prepare for this, and in some ways, celebrated it, Kurt was not cut from the same cloth. The song \\"Let Me In\\" is Michael's cry to the heavens almost of an apology that he lacked the ability to help, or at most, to stop Kurt. The savage, mournful guitar (played not by Peter but by Mike) plays a violent dirge as Michael's raw vocals cut to the very heart of the matter. The agony is clear throughout the song, but nearer tothe end, Peter comes in on one-finger organ playing (that he likened to a roller-rink organ sound in an older interview) and it lifts the song further still. The lack of percussion has been parsed down to Bill simply playing a rhythmic tambourine. It's also worth noting that while I don't know if this song was recorded with Mike playing a guitar belonging to Kurt (given to the band by Courtney), every time the song was played in concert, Mike played it on that guitar. This song of fury and sorrow is, to me, one of the most powerful songs R.E.M ever did and it is the highlight of the album for me.<br /><br />The complaints about the constant sonic assault from the feedback-fuzz sound of Peter's guitar to Mike's heavier bass to Bill's pounding drums is so \\"old\\". It makes the haters of this album seem like they're in their 80's telling those noisy kids down the street to keep it down. Even worse are the complaints that \\"This isn't the old R.E.M!\\". That drives me insane. It's basically the same cries of Beatles fans when they started making albums like REVOLVER. It's not what you grew up with, and that's the whole point. No band can be creatively successful putting out the same old thing album after album. Bands need to evolve. R.E.M needed to, but more importantly, WANTED to evolve, and it wasn't for something as base as \\"cashing in\\". Believe me, they made more than enough money from the sales of their previous two albums to retire very comfortably. I think it's just a cop-out from fans who just wanted Michael, Mike, Peter and Bill to go on forever with the whole college rock/jangly guitar/sweet melodies and harmonies/politically-aware content. While I love that stuff, I also found it in me to love this album and consider it one of their best. I still think that Michael put it best when he called OUT OF TIME their \\"Love\\" album, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE their \\"Loss\\" album, and MONSTER their \\"D**k\\" album.<br /><br />When I'm 80, I'm still going to be turning up my hearing aid for MONSTER so that I can show people how rock and roll used to rock in the 90's.the end, Peter comes in on one-finger organ playing (that he likened to a roller-rink organ sound in an older interview) and it lifts the song further still.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|While this book won't be going onto my Top 10 Favorites List, it was really good. A quick read that sucks you in, and unlike similar books, it wasn't too predictable. I would definitely read other books by this author.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This entire series reads very much like romance novels. It's perfect for a nymphomaniac. It's just page after page of sex in detail. Can get boring.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a fantastic quick read. While I could easily predict where the characters would end up at the end of book three, the journey/storyline between books 1-3 is great and totally unpredictable. Love love this book!!

0679892478|5.0|I have a six month old that we read to all the time.  We have several \\"counting books\\" but most of them have really limited vocabulary.  My son would get bored with them.  This book has a good story to it (typical of Dr Seuss books) and he really pays attention to the story as we learn to count to 10.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to introduce numbers to their infant.
1250000971|4.0|I really enjoyed the first book \\"Only Time Will Tell, but \\"The Sins of the Fathers\\" seemed to fall short.  The storyline seemed to lag in places and some parts were predictable and then it dragged on to the expected cliffhanger at the end.<br /><br />At a few placed in the book, the time sequence jumped a few years unexpectedly and I was left wondering what happened in those years and Mr. Archer never went back to that part of the character's life.  It left you hanging and wondering what happened and not in a good way.<br /><br />If you are a first time reader of the Clifton Chronicles this is NOT the book to start.  Read the first novel \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" because if you read this one first, you will have no idea what is going on and the relationship of the characters to one another.<br /><br />I hope the third book of the Clifton Chronicles is along the lines of the first novel where you just can't bear to put the book down.  The Sins of the Father is worth reading but don't expect it to be like the first novel as you will be a bit disappointed.
0307931803|5.0|I have the original Fox in Socks book but when my 6 month old became interested in helping turnt he pages and chewing on the book, I decided to get the board book.  It is shorter than the original but still very good.  The typical sing-song rymes of Dr. Suess is still present and it is a very fun tongue twister book.  My son loves to hear all the funny words and will laugh when his dad or I get tongue tied on the poem.  We all have a lot of fun with this book and it is great for language development.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This is a Great story, never saw the ending coming. Well written. Would recommend definetly. A love story for the books :)
067144901X|5.0|I had to add to the raves on this book.  My little girl is a teenager now, but when she was pre-verbal and just starting to talk this was her favorite book.  I would have to read it to her over and over--I counted 20 times one day. (I thought my head was going to explode.)  But, it is a delightful book.  It's easy to get into the rhyme and get caught in the \\"enthusiasm\\" of the book.  I never thought I was very good at ready aloud, but this book taught me how to do so.  I give a copy to everyone I know as a first-birthday present for the baby and I have a copy in storage for the grandkids--whenever they show up.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This would have to be without doubt the worst read I have ever subjected myself to.  Very disappointing ending.  No way was I going to subject myself to anymore after this one.  One was more than enough.  I was hoping for a twist in the end but alas - boringly predictable.
0575100133|3.0|I like the Psy-Changeling stories and read all books so far... and I think that is where the problem lies with this book. All who have been reading the series must have seen this coming, were in fact waiting for it.<br />The complaints of many reviewers are correct. There just is not enough Hawke and Sienna in the book, but that is simply because we already knew what was going to happen, and have known since book 1. I suppose that is why we also get the Walker-Lara story. Hawke and Sienna are probably \\"too important\\" for a novella, but that's what would have been better.<br />Having said all that, I'd say the book was probably necessary in the overall story arc. We'll see when the new books come out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|50 shades, although the \\"intimate\\" scenes are worth the read.... I feel it is better suited as a drinking game at a book club: every time the author writes \\"inner goddess\\" everyone takes a shot.<br /><br />Love the mommy porn, not so much in love with the plot/writing.

B0079K4WEE|5.0|PERFECT SENSE begins as a pretensious ARTHOUSE film, with an overwhelming ambition to prove to its viewers just how sensitive, insightful and conceptual another apocalyptic contagious endemic can be. After the pretense of the arty, poetic narration, and the cinematography that offers a veneer of intellectual and emotional depth at every turn, one begins to lose themselves inside the love story, and the symbolic nature of the plot devices. After that tipping point is reached, the film grows on you quickly, as it infects the viewer with its symbolic deconstruction of the human condistion. In the beginning, you have two existencially remote people, Ewan McGregor- a gourmet chief, and Eva Green- a Biologist specialising in Epidemiology, both going thru life, afraid to connect to others too deeply, for fear of their own human deficits. Then, an unknown, bizarre epidemic grips the world. You experience great sadness, and then cant smell. You experience great fear, and cant taste, you experience great hatred, and cant hear, etc. This epidemic is transmitted thru emotional contagions, not germs or viruses. As the gourmet chief loses the basis of his art (taste and smell), and as the epidemiologist loses her ability to save humanity with her own art(biology), the two find they love each other.  Less an apocalyptic thriller true to the genre type, and more a post-modern morality tale discriping how humanity breaks down emotional barriers to one another, PERFECT SENSE lets the viewer consider the ONE perfect sense that humanity will have to depend upon, if life is to go on...TOUCH. As the two lovers touch, at the end of the film, you realize that within the symbolism of the film, they have found the only PERFECT SENSE all humans have---the sense of LOVE, of TOUCH, of knowing someone is CLOSE TO YOU.<br /><br />If you are one to collect european art films, or enjoyed movies like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, you're sure to love this film. With the film's saturation of opulent cinematography, sensuous soundtrack, and poetic script, its easy to uncover a new level of meaning, every time you watch it. More so than almost any Scifi genre, this movie demands a suspension of disbelief, and a tacit acceptence of the poetic artifice behind the plot. What is the nature of the apocalypse? Hatred, rage, and fear as our senses shut down in the presence of death? Of course, no doubt. Or, in the final moments of humanity, is meaning to be found in facing the darkness of death, while bravely touching each other's soul with love, with joy, and forgiveness? THis is the great choice facing the film's characters, as it also faces all humanity. This embodies the very HEART, the actual PLOT of the movie. PERFECT SENSE treads new ground, not just in style but also in substance, something few films ever aspire to, let alone achieve.opulent cinematography, sensuous soundtrack, and poetic script, its easy to uncover a new level of meaning, every time you watch it.

B00000E7Q6|5.0|After the whole Tin Machine thing folded, Mr. David Bowie, the musical universe's Thin White Emperor concocted a brilliant glittering gift for his new Empress, the beautiful Iman. Among the aural gems in this masterpiece are his lushly romantic WEDDING SONG, his danceworthy JUMP THEY SAY, his equally danceworthy LOOKING FOR LESTER, an instrumental on which he duets with jazz great Lester Bowie (no relation to The Gentleman!) and his intense, trancelike PALLAS ATHENA, along with some covers (I FEEL FREE and I KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOME DAY)that surpass the originals. This jewel in the crown of music's monarch doesn't deserve to be out of print. It deserves to be a classic on the order of Ziggy Stardust and Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane. I wish I could rate it 10 stars!
0061733199|4.0|The book is full of good advices about survival. Who knows when one of these save one's life. A must for people who like wilderness and adventure.
B007IE4DSG|4.0|This album isn't revelatory and in no way outshines Harrison's studio albums. It is an excellent bonus disc that was originally included with the documentary's blu-ray edition. For those of us who don't feel the need to own the film (though I did enjoy it on television), it's a real treat that it has been given a separate release. One might accuse a collection like this of being a cash grab, but it's priced very low, and the sound quality is excellent. So, it is respectful of the fans, provided for those of us who will forever be hungry for more music by this wonderful artist.<br /><br />I would hate for them to get to the point where they're releasing music from the bottom of the barrel, but, as this collection is called \\"Volume 1,\\" I think we can all look forward to a \\"Volume 2\\" with more great demos--unless they do as the Traveling Wilburys did and skip straight to \\"Volume 3!\\"

0871404133|5.0|Few books are accessible to the general public AND deeply profound at the same time.  This book achieves both.  Although there's many more memorable passages, my biggest take-away was how he defines human nature in one sentence, that we are torn between group and individual selection forces.  In getting to that profound statement, he first dismisses Richard Dawkins's work THE SELFISH GENE ony to validate THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE written by, yes, Richard Dawkins.  If that's not all, Dr. Wilson dismisses the works of scores of heavy-hitting biologists when he says that kinship selection has been proven wrong.  You could read Richard Dawkins response to that on his web site in Dr. Dawkins's review of THE SOCIAL CONQUEST OF EARTH.  Suffice it to say, Dr. Dawkins, and, more importantly, most other scientists, don't agree with Dr. Wilson's dismissal of kinship selection.<br /><br />Whether any of the theory of kinship selection is true, I don't know.  What I do know is that THE SOCIAL CONQUEST OF EARTH is a fascinating book worthy of reading.  Best wishes... - lc
B007P06DO0|5.0|I bought the original album and CD. I bought the \\"enhanced version\\" a while back, and the re-release with bonus tracks.  This, however, is an amazing package well worth the price.  In addition to the documentary (seen on A&E but here without commercial interruption) and the African concert (which I once had on VHS tape), there is the original album which wisely is just that: the bonus tracks come on a separate disc.  And it is a great set of bonus tracks containing some from before but some wonderful cuts from the original South African recordings.  And Paul's \\"Story of Graceland\\", the song, not the album, is a masterful, enchanting account.  The packaging is lavish.  The booklet contains, in addition to a plethora of photos of Paul, the band, and  memorabilia, has some great interviews and \\"articles\\" if you will. There is a nice large, when unfolded, poster, of the album cover artwork.  For a Simon fan, this is a must!  You won't regret it.

B005LAIH3G|4.0|\\"John Carter\\" was so brutally savaged by most critics that I felt I was taking a chance buying the four-disk set (which I got at a very good price). Well, it's a delightful, highly entertaining film.<br /><br />Unlike the dreadful \\"Flash Gordon\\", \\"John Carter\\" respects its source. The tone is serious, without arch or campy humor. The story is treated as romantic fantasy, which is what it is. (Michael Giacchino's excellent score sets the right mood.) Though there's a fair amount of action, it's not excessive or gratuitous. The focus is principally on the characters. The ending is highly satisfying, and //almost// draws a tear. Almost.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch (an unfortunate name for the star of a fantasy film!) isn't a great actor, but he's more than competent. His height (IMDB says he's 6', but he looks a lot shorter) and wiry build make him a believable 19th-century soldier.<br /><br />One assumes Roger Ebert's readers are more-perceptive than the average movie-goer, so it's notable that the viewer rating on Ebert's site is 3 out of 4 stars.<br /><br />Once people who didn't see \\"John Carter\\" in the theater see it on home video, they'll talk it up. \\"John Carter\\" is a good film that needs no apology, and will eventually be considered a classic fantasy.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />ADDENDUM (\\"PS\\" seemed weak)... It's rare to see a film receive such wildly varying audience reviews: \\"A masterpiece!\\" is followed by \\"It's garbage!\\". We all think we have better taste/judgment than those who disagree with us. Being no different, I feel obliged to stick in another two cents.<br /><br />No doubt fanboys (of which I an /not/ one) like films such as \\"John Carter\\" simply because they're acceptable adaptations of a favorite story. Then there are those who detest such films because they don't like the genre, or they find fault with (what they perceive as) \\"bad\\" acting/writing/direction.<br /><br />My all-time favorite film is the magnificently acted and directed \\"Amadeus\\". (Peter Shaffer's screenplay is merely \\"excellent\\". The acting and direction raise it to a perceived level of superbativeness.) I just got the DVD of \\"The Apostle\\", Robert Duvall's tour-de-force of writing, acting, and directing, to replace my LV copy. I'll be taking a course in screenwriting at TheFilmSchool in July (yes, really), and wanted to watch it at least once again. (If you haven't seen this film, /do so/.) I think I know the difference between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\", writing-, acting-, and directing-wise.<br /><br />What, exactly, were the \\"John Carter\\" haters expecting? It's taken from pulp novels written by a man who felt he could churn out fiction at least as rotten (his word) as the cheap stuff he was reading. The film spends 1/7 its running time giving John Carter a backstory, so we know why he acts as he does. The story plays out as drama (though a weak one); the characters' personalities and interactions are generally plausible. (I don't know how much Michael Chabon contributed, but it's hard to believe he wouldn't have tried to push what is basically an action/adventure tale in the direction of a character-driven story.)<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" avoids some of the clich&eacute;s of romantic fiction. Carter might be a great sword-swinger, but he won't fight other people's battles. (This is why some viewers incorrectly perceive him as a \\"pacifist\\".) And as Carter still pines for his wife, do you expect him to immediately start drooling over Ms Thoris's thorax? (Though the humanoid Martians are mammalian, the script wisely avoids revealing that they lay eggs. Deejah Thoris is kin to the duck-billed platypus.)<br /><br />I'll agree with the naysayers in one respect... Over the past 30 years, American films have become increasingly cool and  affectless, losing the intense emotions of Hollywood's Golden Age. (Had Michael Curtiz directed \\"John Carter\\", there would have been fewer objections.) It's also true that effects-heavy films can make it hard for directors to keep the focus on the characters, rather than which shots have to be completed that day. I don't like this, but what's a viewer supposed to do? Reject such films altogether?<br /><br />Is \\"John Carter\\" a great (in the absolute sense) film? Of course not. Is it a bad film? Emphatically no. Could it have been better? Definitely. It is what it is -- a well-made adaptation of cheap fiction. If you don't like the latter, fine -- but don't blame the film for being an honest representation of its source.make it hard for directors to keep the focus on the characters, rather than which shots have to be completed that day.

B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I love the album and I love Nora Jones.  But I didn't know that until I downloaded the album.  She is such a versatile singer.
B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|I was blown away by this incredible Jazz CD, even though I have known and admired Brad's music for many years. The piece de resistance for me is \\"Days of Dilbert Delaney,\\" where his technical prowess is just out of this world. How he keeps the melodic, rythmic and harmonic parts of this song together on his piano is absolutely beyond me. I know he does a lot of hand crossovers, but his chops are just unbelievable. After the disaster of \\"Largo,\\" it is exiliranting to see him back in full form. Bravo!<br /><br />I hope one day he records A.C.Jobim/Chico Buarque's \\"Retrato em Preto e Branco,\\" which I saw him perform solo at the Newport Jazz Festival a few years back to great effect. I love his close-to-the-theme improvisation (a la Louis Armstrong) on this song. There is a pirate version of it going around, but it is truncated and the recording is horrible (it is in itunes in darn MP3 format - as Neil Young said today on WNYC's \\"Leornard Lopate Show\\" MP3 should be illegal, as it destroys the sound totally).
B007UXTG8M|4.0|I watched this because Michael Fassbender was in it and he is a very handsome man.<br />So watching him have a lot of sex was super.<br />But the movie also really lends a lot to the complexity of the characters and it is very well done!
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|So... it's a sci-fi themed imitation of Yoo Ninja? Multiplayer is a nice addition (although personally I don't play smartphone games for the deep human interaction), but soliciting more money from us through microtransactions and a file size that's 4x as large as Yoo Ninja are deal-breakers.
B0076NKLRQ|3.0|This was a nice story but really not that interesting at all...the style of the film is nice, the actress who is Marilyn does a convincing job but that's all the take away that I got.....

B007NYODBS|2.0|I expected so much more...this was not razor sharp.<br />It ended up being dull and typical. You already know what to expect.<br />As a play on stage I think it would be much more interesting and physical work for actors!
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This book is so beautifully written! I loved every minute. It kept me turning the pages and it was very hard to put down. The only thing I was dissapointed about was the ending. It was spectacular, of course. Unlike anything I've ever read. But I was so attached to Alex and Lena's relationship, that the ending completely tore me apart. But, I still loved the book!!!!
B006BQFUOS|4.0|So when I heard that they were making it into a movie, of course i had my doubts.<br />But the movie actually delivers. So go for it. It's really moving.

B0077PBPJ6|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewer's. I just didn't catch the flow or love.<br />I thought it would be there but in the end it was heavily depressing to me.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I don't know why everyone dogs this movie. It's a werewolf tale set in a small village during the Middle Ages. A werewolf is on the loose and people are dying, so the villagers enlist the help of a werewolf-hunter, who becomes as much of a problem as the werewolf. The film builds-up suspense as to the identity of the werewolf and I wasn't able to figure it out. But, once the explanation is given, it all makes sense. If you pay close attention you might be able to figure it out.<br /><br />As my title blurb points out, this is a spectacularly good-looking film with awesome photography, locations, sets and actors. Wide-eyed Amanda Seyfried is perfect as the protagonist.<br /><br />When all is said and done, Red Riding Hood ranks well with the better werewolf flicks.
1400049628|2.0|I read Max Brook's World War Z and enjoyed it. It was an interesting read with an interesting format and I thought the author managed to capture a documentary feeling with all the added trappings of an exciting novel. Having finished World War Z, I obtained a copy of The Zombie Survival Guide, expecting the same level of skill. It was not to be.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is a bad book, but by comparison to his other work, Max Brooks falls short. I understand that some people have declared this is a parody of survival books in general, but having read many such survival guides, I was not impressed with the content and advice regarding zombies. I suspect the author knows little about firearms outside what he has read, and some of his terms show a lack of study and research. Just for the record, there is no such thing as \\"Plate Mail\\". It's either Plate armor or maille or a combination of the two, but not \\"Plate Mail\\". The only thing that comes close to fitting such a description is the ancient Chinese armor made up of a series of small plates connected by rings, but that is not the type of armor to which the author refers. I suppose one might consider such observations petty and unimportant, but if you are going to write about a subject, at least get it right from an academic perspective.<br /><br />What is so disappointing is that World War Z is a far better survival guide on its own than the Zombie Survival Guide. Even the vignettes of recorded outbreaks at the end of the book are dull and uninteresting. Knowing the author has real talent, I'm disappointed in what he presented here.<br /><br />The book is not a total loss, but I expected much more.

B000GBEWHA|4.0|I well remember the publicity surrounding the premiere of this musical in 1978. As my parents thought I was too young to see it when it first debuted, I wouldn't see it in its entirety until three years after its release, but after I acquired a copy of the soundtrack, I became one of the cool kids at my Elementary School because I was one of two girls who could bring it to be played in my home room class just before the weekends---wonderful days!<br />  I also remember the commentary of a few classmates who did see it;namely, \\"'Grease' was stupid!\\" -- a sentiment I have come to appreciate as I got older because it advocates the idea that a nice girl should give in to the peer pressure of the less desireable element in order to keep her boyfriend.<br />  Still, it's never a dull flick to watch.<br />  On the 40th anniversary of the debut of the original(and reportedly racier) Broadway version of this story, I dedicate this editorial toast to Jim Jacobs, Warren Casey's and Bronte Woodward's highly significant pop cultural work, here directed by Randal Kleiser and  produced by Alan Carr.<br /> We follow young Australian student, Sandy Olsen ( Olivia-Newton John in her definitive role) and her romance with Danny Zuko( John Travolta) on the California Coast sometime in the late 50s. Amid strains of an instrumental version of \\"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\\", we see two sweet teenagers frolic on the beach, and then lament Sandy's impending departure to her native Australia.<br />  Then, amid the dynamic contemporary sound of the title song, sung by Frankie Valli, and cute cartoon graphics that give viewers an edification of the trends of the 50s,the first day at Rydell High School begins, where we meet the principals in this drama, including tough but vulnerable Betty Rizzo(Stockard Channing), greasers Kenickie( Jeff Conaway), Doody, (Barry Pearl), Sonny (Michael Tucci), and Putzie(Kelly Ward),who comprise the T-Birds, and their female counterparts the Pink Ladies , including the amiable beauty-school student Frenchy (Didi Conn),big-haired Marty Maraschino(Dinah Manoff), and Jan ( Jamie Donnelly).<br /> Principal McGee,( Eve Arden) proves herself perfectly capable of holding her own against the resident rowdies, although the nerdy Eugene Felnic(Eddie Deezen) has no such luck.McGee's secretary Blanche( Dody Goodman) has a few issues of incompetency,Alice Ghostley's Mrs. Murdock is the shop teacher with a pivotal role in the story.<br />  As Sandy befriends Frenchy and the other girls, Danny's High School alter ego-- a leather jacket-wearing cigarette smoking gang member is revealed.<br />  Susan Buckner's high achiever, Patty Simcox proves to be an annoyance for the Pink Ladies during lunch hour, but she invites Sandy to join the cheerleading squad and  Sandy and Danny give differing versions of their summer romance in the song \\"Summer Nights\\".<br />  At an evening bonfire and pep rally, Principal McGee and Coach Calhoun(Sid Caesar) give comically pathetic speeches in an attempt to rally the football players to a long-elusive victory.<br />  Aware of the truth about Danny after Sandy reveals the name of her summer paramour, The Pink Ladies reunite her with Danny, who in the company of his gang members has to remain cool and aloof in front of a \\"chick\\" and therefore represses his excitement at their unexpected reunion, hurting Sandy.<br />  A sleepover at Frenchy's house reveals Rizzo's obvious resentment for the well-brought-up Sandy after Frenchy botches her attempt to pierce Sandy's ears.But Marty tries unsuccessfully to help Sandy overcome her heartache by writing to any of her varied swains in other places.The song \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" expresses Sandy's feelings.<br />  Rizzo gets bored and leaves the slumber party to go off with they guys when they show up. Tensions increase when Kenickie kicks the others out of his car to be alone with Rizzo, but that encounter will have potentially  dire consequences for Rizzo later on.<br />  Sandy starts dating football player Tom Chisolm(Lorenzo Lamas, portraying life in the decade in which his parents were at the height of their fame), and at the local malt shop where screen veteran Joan Blondell as waitress, Vi, serves up the shakes and presides over a thousand adolescent dramas,Danny apologizes to Sandy for his previous behavior, but when he criticizes the accomplished athlete she is dating, she challenges him to see how well he'd fare as an athlete, a challenge Danny accepts.<br />  In the meantime Frenchy fails beauty school, ending up with pink hair due to a tinting class snafu. Vi is ill prepared to advise her on what to do next. Frankie Avalon's Teen Angel steps in to do that the in number, \\"Beauty School Drop-Out\\".<br /> Coach Calhoun presides over a comical episode in which Danny tries to find a suitable sport to impress Sandy, but his streetwise persona hinders his ability to get along with others in contact sports.So he ends up as a cross country runner.<br />  The story could have ended happily right there, with a street kid trying to be something more, but alas it doesn't.<br />  Amid a lively soundtrack, we follow the gang through the National Bandstand Dance, held in the school gym , and presided over by DJ Vince Fontaine( Ed Byrnes), who tries to seduce Marty. Johnny Casino and the Gamblers(Sha-Na-Na) perform as a fight between Kenickie and the leader of the Rival Gang The Scorprions, Crater Face(Dennis Stewart) breaks out on the dance floor as Rizzo, his disgusted date, leaves, the gang reunite Danny with former girlfriend Cha-Cha Di Gregorio( Annette Charles), and rig the dance contest so they end up together, pushing Sandy out of the way, and Putzi, Sonny, and Doody moon the camera on national televison, but manage to avoid trouble.<br />  During a night at the drive-in, Rizzo has a pregnancy scare that becomes the talk of the campus. Sandy's reunion with Danny is brief, due to his attempt to come on too strong, The era ofguys trying to get reputations and girls trying not to makes itself felt in that scene.<br />  Overshadowing the greasers' lives is the upcoming auto race with the Scorpions. A calamity will alter the course of that event unexpectedly.<br />  The year-end school carnival is a joyous romp, with loose-ends tied up ,Sandy having made a crucial life decision(for which any girl's parents could disown her) two more great musical numbers, and  the glorious sense that youth may have that come what may they'd always be together.<br />  One can faintly hope that Sandy will somehow end up as a more positive influence on her greaser guy. But at least for the moment, they remain the coolest couple, and audiences will be satisfied with that.Whatever the future may hold, the youthful spirit of this story endures.
B002GY9F9K|1.0|This series is unlike the books in every possible way. The only things similar are the names of characters, places, and the fact that there is a confessor, a seeker, and a gar. The story is made up entirely. Very little of Goodkind's writing remains. If you're a fan of the novels, don't get this. I bought it because I had hoped it would be similar to the novels.  Also, I'm afraid I can't praise the acting in any way.  Bad, bad, bad. I can't even enjoy it if I pretend it's a different story.
B005FPT51K|5.0|I'm not sure why a lot of the other reviewers are having issues, and, contrary to one other review, this device DOES work via 3G cellular network. We've been using the iBaby for about six months now it has never dropped its connection to our home network, and works every time we access it via our iPhones. I'm also not sure why so many people are having issues getting the iBaby set up. It's about as plug and play as you can get and is WAY easier than other devices in this category. The only thing I wish it had was a built-in speaker for 2-way communication. Out the box you can listen to whatever's going on in the room, but you have to purchase an external speaker to communicate back........definitely not a big deal though. Yes, it's expensive but so are other cameras that have as many functions as this does, and this one is optimized for iOS so if you plan on viewing from an iOS device, this is the one to get.

B007U1FEJE|3.0|This is the sound of Brian Wilson trying to remember the Beach Boys, and memories have a way of filling in the gaps with things that aren't still there. This album wouldn't make anybody wish they were from sunny Cal-I-Forn-I-A, and California girls are no longer the measure of all others, and everybody, for sure, are not wish'n they had an ocean.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Do not buy this cable. It doesn't charge my Kindle unless I place it *just right* and that is a pain. I trusted this cable as I read on Amazon that you need a special Kindle cable to charge your Kindle. So I buy this one and it only works to transfer data between my Kindle and my computer. A disappointment !
0345803485|1.0|This book is a total embarrassment on so many levels. The writing feels like a 14 year old wrote it. The characters are totally unbelievable.......the sex is even more so, and the language of \\"jeez\\", and \\"this is so hot\\" on every other page made me cringe. So after 20 pages I stopped reading and wondered how this book became a bestseller.<br /><br />The writing is just incredibly bad. And the fact that America is eating it up, is quite disturbing to say the least. A pure embarrassment.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|You will meet some people who will whine about this album.  They will try to compare it to \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"Smile\\".  Two albums.  It's always those two albums.  Well, \\"Pet Sounds\\" IS an excellent Beach Boys album.  \\"Smile\\" is a great Brian Wilson album.<br /><br />This one is not as amazing as \\"Pet Sounds\\", but way more fun and listenable than \\"Smile\\".  \\"Smile was great, but hardly the album you want to drive to while cruising down the road.  THIS album is that.<br /><br />It's a very fun, very catchy album.  It feels like some of the fun songs from the early 60s.  And to have ALL of The Beach Boys together again is simply wonderful.  If you're a true Beach Boys fan, you'll love this album.  If you're a fan of the fun surf songs, this is the album for you.  If you're another pretentious music critic who can't seem to get his mind off of \\"Pet Sounds\\" for one hour, this album is not for you.  Lighten up, go listen and have some fun.  Isn't that what listening to The Beach Boys should be all about?<br /><br />Go listen.  It's fun.  It's really a great album.

0439023513|5.0|I have to commend Amazon on how quickly they got this book to me. WAY earlier than the expected date of delivery. Also even with shipping rates included they were much cheaper than going to the book store (which was how I got the second book).<br /><br />As for this series .... OH MY GOD! I'm so upset that this is the last book. I have everyone in my family completely addicted.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Disney botched the marketing...surprisingly enjoyable story. Plot moves very fast with an interesting story line for those unfamiliar with the John Carter narrative.<br /><br />rent it!
0545425115|3.0|The book is not a masterpiece of literature but it is a highly entertaining young adult book with dark themes and violence and the exploration of dystrophy that adults can enjoy as well. It's an easy read with a fast pace and high entertainment factor. The writing style is geared towards young adult readers but is smooth and polished, with content that is meant for the high school level and above. It's told in present tense, which amps up the tension and cements the reader in the current moment. I appreciated the well-handled elements of horror and sci-fi along with the strong feminism that many current romance-driven books seem to lack. There is much more to Katniss than romance; in fact, she herself admits that romance is the least of her concerns right now, as it should be. She doesn't want to get married, and she doesn't want to bring children into the world only to have them potentially get pulled for the Hunger Games. I like this girl. This is a heroine I can get behind.
1469984202|5.0|I've been an avid reader my whole life.  Amazon and Kindle have taken me to the next level.  Searching Amazon for inexpensive fodder for my reading habit, I stumbled across Wool.  Hugh Howey?  Never heard of him.  The title caught my interest, the reviews convinced me to read it and I cannot express how much pleasure I derived from the rarest form of reading - a book you can't put down.  Unfortunately, now I've got a Hugh Howey habit along with my other obsessions.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire delivers just like The Hunger Games did. Catching Fire finally delivered on the action that I felt was sometimes lukewarm in its predecessor. Except for a few lulls in the story, this book went from one major event to another, and the excitement I felt was so incredible and so energizing, I literally dreaded coming to the last few pages. Collins really does know how to catch her readers and hold their attention.
B00386EZJU|5.0|We got into How to Train Your Dragon the movie after our local concert band started playing the theme music. My 4 year old would hum along with the music as she watched the movie so we got the sound track and the LOVES it (and so do we)! She would listen to it daily if I let her.
B0002W19KQ|1.0|i could not play this DVD on a regular DVD player.  I had to use my computer only.<br />Worst of all - the language is only English!  I had ordered French language!  there is only 1 CD! and not 2 as the product details said.<br />This is a total rip off!  I could not return it because.. i received it too late.  I was on vacation and could not make the deadline for returns!  Totally, waste of money!

B004V26A2A|5.0|An award winning book is a great thing to read. Have been meening to read this for quite a while.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I borrowed this book from the public library because I was a bit scared off by some of the reviews.  Even more positive ones contained warnings like \\"I love this author but this is not the book to start with\\".  So I borrowed the book, devoured it twice, and then bought it because I can see myself reading it again and again.  Do you like One Hunderd Years of Solitude?  You'll love this.  Very different writing styles, but that same \\"Anything can and may happen in this world whether or not it matches your perception of reality.  Deal with it\\".  It's been a couple of weeks and I'm still thinking about this book, pondering some of the concepts, and debating the identities of some of the characters (Wait!  Is the young nurse of Tengo's father actually his mother??). Definitely not for everyone, definitely a book that requires you to think, definitely a book which requires patience. But fascinating for the ride.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is an excellent app. I use it basically on a daily basis, sometimes as a resource, sometimes for entertainment value.
0345803485|2.0|My partner picked this up and we read the first quarter of it to each other. The story was decent and would have had a lot more impact except it was so terribly written that I wouldn't continue reading. For example, the author uses the exact same words to describe the same actions over and over again. Or that the author uses painfully bland descriptions of situations that a high school kid could describe with more colour and flair.<br /><br />Unfortunate that this quality of writing makes the best-sellers list. Skip the book and wait for the movie, where hopefully the screenplay won't suck as badly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A Nice, sleek, 'shiney' calculator that almost seems real. I love it. Would like to change the 'stain' of what looks like wood though... just a thought. But it does work great!
B0079J28NW|5.0|This is an excellent transfer of the film. I've owned the VHS version, the DVD, and now the Blu-ray. Without question the Blu-ray with its remastered video is a revelation. Colors are better, the picture is the sharpest its ever been and the music is well, still the Beatles which means if you're a fan it's a no-brainer. This is the same version as the DVD which means it includes \\"Hey Bulldog\\" and a few other minor changes from the VHS release. The audio is available in both a new HD surround track or the original film version.<br /><br />The movie itself is very simple but wonderfully weird as it involves freeing Pepperland from the clutches of the \\"Blue Meanies\\", with numerous Beatles songs along the way. If you like the Beatles, psychedelic animation, or cultural artifacts from the 1960's this is a great buy.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|This movie lives up to the description that is provided and in all ways exceeded my expectations. It develops the storyline and the characters quickly and was a very enjoyable watch.
0345803485|1.0|Repetitive and unnecessary. I'm disappointed that THIS is the general population's introduction to erotic literature. Read The Story of O, Anne Rice's Beauty Trilogy or Anais Nin. Watch Secretary. Don't read this.
B004GYY714|5.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire.  It gets all the stations that I used to get on my Squeezebox (blogs, channels, Rhapsody, etc.), so I gave my Squeezebox to my son.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|I know that some of my fellow Beach Boys fans are so happy that the band is back together that they would give the new record 5 stars even if it were just recordings of Brian Wilson belching. So I'm trying to offset that with a review that doesn't reflect only my own enthusiasm for their reunion. But the great news is: this is a very good album! There are a couple of pleasant-sounding but inconsequential tracks on it, for sure, and the one song that Brian didn't write (Daybreak Over the Ocean) reminds us all why we never bought any Mike Love solo records (love Mike, by the way, but he needs Brian). But there are some truly transcendent songs on this album that sort of cover all previous Beach Boy types. First, as with their earlier records, there are a couple of wonderful pop songs: Spring Vacation, Shelter, and the title song, despite its corny lyrics. And then there are beautiful Brian compositions more similar to the more melodic elements of Smile: Think About the Days to open the album (the final chord change is gorgeous), and the three-song suite at the end of the album. Al has a fantastic lead on From There to Back Again, and the three songs together seem to tell the emotional story of the Beach Boys at this point in their life: some nostalgia, some sadness, and some acknowledgement that death is approaching. Listen to anything released by any other band this year: no one will write a series of songs as complex and beautiful as these three.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|good game. one of the better object games. I like just about anything snarky. looking forward to the nex

B007ZRZF8I|4.0|Don't listen to those whining about in app purchases.  They must not know how to read as it is stated in the description.  This is a good game.  If you hate in app then you don't have to play it.  Great game, even without the extra content.  Even for a buck this game is worth the initial fee.  as for those giving it horrible ratings cause the in app purchases, you are the biggest flaw with this rating system.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|good game this game Is a mix of jet pack joyride really good mix. of the game. I like it just needs a little improvement and the game will the best game ever.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game no problems for me at all. I have this game on my kindle fire, ipad 2, and iphone 4S. Works great on all 3. On my Ipad 2 and iphone 4s I'm on level 30 or higher. So thank you great game!

B00022LRXA|5.0|In 1977 this is the one that introduced me to Eno and my view of \\"what music is\\" was changed forever. A clasic that still sounds new to anyone who has never listened to it previously.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is soo awesome because what's more entertaining than running from death monkeys in a temple all wrapped into an app?!?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While the synopsis of the story initially sounds like a bad lifetime movie, the book caught my attention from start to finish. The heroine was a pleasure to spend time with, and she remains irreverent, witty, and clear-eyed while confronting her own demise. I tried reading this as slow as I could because I realized it's one of those books that come by rarely.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game with lots of activities a a a a a a a a a a a a a a

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun!  I loved Kung Fu Scrat the most, esp. when I got the animal for the prize.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this in April, and after waiting what seemed like forever to me for the weather to finally warm up enough to set it up, set it up and was able to let the kids play with it.  The directions could have been a little clearer in letting me know where all the holes were that needed to be filled with air.  I was still able to get it set up in about 20 minutes and the kids loved it.  They played in it all weekend.  By the end of the weekend we would have needed to refill the air a little bit as the slide wanted to sink but that was all.  There is a lot of different things the kids can do (and did) with this pool.  Plenty big for my 2 very active kids.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun game. Very good for people who like SimCity like games.<br />Worth at least trying the free download version and trying out.

B007N85ZXY|2.0|I have been a long time Neil Young fan and like so many I know have been pleased, excited, sadened and dissapointed by different aspects of his output over his long career.  I was pretty excited to get this one, I love his work with Crazy Horse more than the rest.  After getting this, I am dissapointed.  It seems formless and uninspired (or at least leave me uninspired).  It has a droning quality to it that makes so much of it unmemorable. Sorry Neil, but I can't keep punishing myself like this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game even my little brothers like to play it.It is easy to play it and fun.LOVE IT!!!!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Mentally challenging game that had excellent features like zooming and multiple cell editing that make it easy to play. The game comes with many levels that provides quite a number of hours of enjoyment.

1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller delivers a completely magnificent story! The art work is so creative. Each page, each illustration captures your imagination and enhances the story further. However, if you don't like gruesome, you might not want to pick this book up.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good decompression game...am playing it to relax before sleeping.  I like the ease of use and advice when I go wrong
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a great author and this book is one of his best. Instead of the typical love story this one is a story that most people can relate to in some way or another.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a Meh game pretty good overall its not worth paying for but a hood way to keep from getting bored
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Quite an extravagant display of genius and artful execution. Right-o. Jolly good fun. Seriously, awesome game, upgrades and allies and general sweetness.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|People, STOP supporting these nickel and dime tactics or eventually ALL game developers will start using this price structure.  End the trend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The game is the best it is not a waste of time download it now.You get to make your own town.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This should be named Fifty Shades of OMG! The story line was very weak. I felt the first book was \\"getting to know you (kinky F*&$ery)sex\\". The second book was \\"Learing to like kinky F*&$ery (and a secret past). The third was more of the same until you get half way through and you finally realize there was an actual story being told. The writer must of had a hell of a time doing the prep work! One review said this was a page turner, I agree. I turned so many UNREAD pages because of the redundant sex that reading it was a breeze!
B004UID2LC|1.0|At first it was great but now it tells me &quot;err&quot; WTF! Cant load anything or play anything! Not worth it ppm hopefully they fix it it was a great app but now it aux!

B000008I4Z|1.0|Admittedly I am a Fish-Head and find the band much more effective between Script and The Theiving Magpie. I even enjoy the first two albums with Hogarth. But I have to say that i find Brave unlistenable, easily in my top ten worst CDs in my collection (which is a couple of thousand Cds). I know that the album has a narrative, but it is delivered in such a way that has no hooks, and the songs are largely forgettable. I know a lot of post-Fish-era fans think that this album is phenomenal, but I don't think it deserves the lavish praise I see in the Amazon Reviews. It does not hold a candle to Misplaced Childhood (One of the most effective concept albums ever)Luckily I live in America and have no friends jamming it down my throat. I have convinced a few of my buddies to get into Marillion MKI and have had the luxury of seeing them 5 nights in a row at Radio City Music Hall in NYC in support of RUSH and a couple of times at some smaller venues and then again with RUSH on the Misplaced Childhood tour. I think this says volumes about the original band. No other band has ever warmed up for RUSH on more than one tour. I took a chance on Brave and every once in a while I listen to it to see if there is something I missed, and usually about 15 minutes in I have to turn it off, because I think it sucks. I never bought a Hogarth-era CD after that. I think Hogarth is a good singer but for me it's not the same and I don't like the change in direction. I patiently wait for them to drop Hogarth and bring back Fish.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This set of legos made my son very happy. While looking for different sets of Avengers Lego sets, I was surprised to see how expensive they all were. A basic set is about 20 bucks and has a lot more blocks in it, but these are special because of the movie.<br /><br />I looked everywhere and compared prices on these sets. Walmart was $3-$5 more. I actually found them cheaper on ebay, but the mini-figures had been removed (why even buy them if the mini-figs aren't there?), and a few other places. This seller is not only the cheapest, but fastest seller I found.<br /><br />The set is really nice, and my son loves the captain america mini-fig. They are sturdy, and it looks like the sets might turn into collectibles.<br /><br />5 stars for the seller and the product! Thank you
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I played Myst when I was a kid and I refused to get off the computer because I was determined to finish the game. My dad had to buy the extended versions of the game just because I would finish them too quickly. Same with The Lost City, downloaded it last night at midnight and I just finished the entire game right now. Nerd, I know :)<br /><br />The only thing I would change is (even though I got it for a buck) make the game longer!! That's the only reason it got 4 stars.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|This game costs $1.00 already.  It also has in-app purchases to squeeze even more money from your wallet.  As if that weren't enough, they also filled this PAYED GAME with ADDS!!!  What were they thinking?!  Don't bother with this game.  Teach the developers a lesson by not letting them get away with this ridiculous cash-grab.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is very cute. it is kind of addicting to keep building the ice village. the character are cute in the game.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I won't support products that require in-game purchases to experience the whole game.<br />There is too much opportunity to scam people that way
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this all the time and its gr8 no more small screens just bigger screens<br />;) :) can't wait for updates
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Purchased the book based on the hype of the TV series. Enjoyed it so much, I read the rest of the series. Very well written and never boring.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game so bloody much. Now I have something to do besides watching Tv. why is there a required amount of words for a review? I told you I like the product. there's no need to be annoying about it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Gameinformer said this was a must play. They weren't joking. Lots and lots of great levels. A well balanced game. And great visuals.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|A must see for any drama, zombie, adventure or action junkie. It will leave you asking for more after every episode.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the game I have been waiting for. the only thing I do not like is wen the game starts dragging but other then that liv the game
0375842209|5.0|My thoughts about The Book Thief are very hard to put together since this book truly blew me away and I have no idea why I did not read it sooner.  Set in Germany in the 1940's in the midst of World War II, The Book Thief is narrated by Death. Liesel Meminger is quickly introduced as the book thief as she travels to her new foster family with her mother and younger brother.  Her brother dies on the train and Liesel steals her first book, The Grave Digger's Handbook, when it is dropped in the cemetery.  She keeps this a secret until her foster father discovers the book one night.  Together the two explode the words and Liesel's world expands.<br /><br />It is so hard for me to put words to how I feel about this book.  I know that it has been said by so many but this is truly an unique and mind-blowing book, the history and feeling that went into the story writing is more than I have seen in a very long time.  I tend to struggle with books that are set in such a dark time and have many negative issues but this is the exception.  This book made me sit back and really think about this time in our world's history and what it would have been like.<br /><br />I did face one large challenge when it came to reading The Book Thief and that was the style in which it was written.  While I enjoyed the narration from Death it often interrupted the flow of the story for me and I had a hard time getting back on track.  Even though this was a challenge it does not affect my overall feelings and rating of this book.  I do not know any other books that fall into this category for me.  Typically, if I have a hard time with the style I do not enjoy the book as much.  Not so with The Book Thief.
B005LAIHAY|3.0|My personal opinion: I liked the movie. I thought it was fun, very action-packed. Graphics weren't the best. But Guy Pearce was amazing, as usual. And I mainly saw it for a very unknown face, known to me obviously, Joe Gilgun. Gilgun was phenomenal. He always is. And I'm hoping other's will see that and maybe he'll be in more American movies. I recommend seeing this movie but don't take it too seriously. It was very cheesey, as the title of this review says. But it was a lot of fun.
B006MVJ2L4|2.0|This cd is nothing exceptional. Adam Lambert has such a great voice but these songs are just average and kind of boring. They all sound alike and there's nothing unique about them. I think I liked one song on this whole track. I think Adam needs to focus on music and not his sex life. That's all he seems to sing about. I personally don't want to know about his sex life. His musical ability and creativity is what matters. Hope he matures that way and shows his true talent.
0553582453|5.0|Another wonderful read by Robin Hobbs!  The story of the Farseer rule continues with Fitz and Lord Golden acting as spys to assure the Farseer reign is in tact.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I am giving this book three stars because I thought it was good, didn't love it and it didn't evoke an OMG reaction. It was good and very well researched.<br /><br />The Story<br />Jesus, so much happened in this story that it is ridiculous, seriously. How to give a recap without spoilers. Deamons, Vampires, Witches and Humans are the four species on the planet. The three \\"creatures\\" are not really supposed to mix because they all have this weird prejudice about each other. Diana is a witch who tries to not use her powers and is a historian, Matthew is a vampire who has been a doctor and scientist and stone worker and who knows what else. Of course, they fall in love. Vampires are crazy protective and he tries to protect Diana as much as he can because she doesn't know how to use her powers. Diana somehow gets a hold of a magical book that the whole supernatural community is looking for and she just gives the book back to the library. Now everyone is looking for her by force or manipulation because they need her to get the book back, she can't use her magic when she wants to, secrets are everywhere and now everyone is mad that a cross species relationship is happening as well! There is action and history and science and all kinds of stuff in this book.<br /><br />Likes<br />--The author seems to have really done her research on this and explained things that are confusing in a decent way for others to understand it.<br />--The writing flowed well and the plot was established and followed through.<br />--Marcus and Hammish were my two favorite characters.<br />--Diana, she was strong and willful and basically kicked ass. If not at first, then by the time she \\"needed\\" to.<br />--The relationship, I am rooting for them to make it through.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />--It was too long for a book one. There seemed to be a couple places earlier that would have worked as a stopping point. There were some scenes that probably could have been removed as they didn't add much tothe story at all.<br />--I thought it was weird that the author had Diana compare Vampires to wolves, I recognize that werewolves are not part of this particular world....but it seemed weird<br />--Matthew was too too possessive and bossy - it was kind of annoying, also too too hot headed<br />--Didn't like that Diana started (view spoiler)[calling Matthew's vampire made children hers. Calling Marcus son, it was weird and I didn't like it one bit. He's like hundreds of years older than her, a thousand times more mature, and yeah, didn't like that (hide spoiler)]<br />--I would see how some of the stuff talked about, alchemy, genetics, etc. may have been too far over some peoples' heads and that may have been a bit hard to grasp. Personally, I skimmed over all of it....it's cool that the author put so much into this world, but I preferred to know what they were talking about without knowing every detail. There was a part in there where Matthew drew a diagram for Sarah and Em to understand something better, a diagram for me too would've helped.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />All in all, it's a good book. I am not personally going to rush out and get book 2 when it comes out, but I know that I will eventually read it to know what happen. Soooo, sure I recommend it.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Excellent read, I would highly recommend it. I found it a little slow to start with but after a few chapters I couldn't put it down. The writing is fantastic and it is an incredibly thought provoking read. Any of my girlfriends that I've spoken to about it have also all raved about it. Excellent book
0062197258|4.0|The story is about a woman who ends up in an emotionally abusive relationship, wants to leave, her friends all turn on her and then things end up physically abusive. It's also about how she is surviving the PTSD and OCD symptoms of what finally happen to her. The story plays out in two parts, a different part in each chapter. One chapter will be about before she met him and leading up to meeting him and the next chapter will be about her life now, back and fourth.    I enjoyed the writing style, at first it was a bit confusing, but once I got into the groove of it I understood it and it made sense. This was a brilliant telling of symptoms of PTSD, the OCD parts were more of the counting and checking multiple times, but her reasoning behind why she was doing it was due to the PTSD I believe. The whole story was intense, dramatic and a bit scary.    It made me think about how I act and behave and if maybe I should be more careful. This book is not for the feint of heart, there is drinking and sex and bad words...a very adult book. I know I acted a bit the way she did when I was in my early 20s. It's hard to know who someone really is, at first he seemed so great! Then it's little things and you start second guessing yourself if those things really matter and you can just change up a bit, then the s*** hits the fan and you're too late to go back.    Anywho, I think this book was brilliantly written, told the story well, seemed well researched (at least from my limited knowledge of police and psychology). This is definitely a book I would recommend to 17 up age group, someone interested in suspense, a story about losing yourself and finding you again, overcoming and living.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I have been a fan of Bob Marley for many years. Enjoy the Carribean, especially Jamaca. The people there have always been most welcoming. This film gives one an insight to Island life and the struggles to survive. It also depicts the fact that \\"worldly\\" materalistic positions are only a cover to true happiness and soulfulness.<br />This film is a compelling documentary. The sound track is right on.
B001W63DX2|5.0|IRON MAIDEN is more than a band...it´s a legend!!!

If you like their sound, this is a nice trip through some of the MAIDEN menbers lives travelling the world...TRULLY, UP THE IRONS!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|too many buttons and you cant see all of your city. otherwise this is a great game and you should download it now
B000V5W7X2|2.0|This episode is so hokey.  People get a virus that causes them to blabber instead of speak normally.  (Awesome idea.) Every time someone gets the virus they say random words, but then the normal person next to them always does the same thing.  They put their hand on their shoulder and say, you should sit down.  What?  You get the virus, you can't communicate, what does that have to do with sitting down?  Finally a long while later someone develops a secondary symptom, they get a fever, ok, _now_ you should sit down.  If everyone still has full mental capacity but they just can't talk, then let them keep working, don't put everyone on the station in the medical bay, that doesn't make sense either.<br /><br />Through the whole episode people are yelling at O'Brien, he doesn't sleep for days trying to fix everyone's computer problems.  And then, stop everything, the commander's black coffee tastes bad.  Finally in end do they say, \\"have a day off buddy\\", or \\"sorry there are more important things to do than fix my problem\\"?  No.  Instead the episode ends with Sisko yelling \\"O'Brien\\" and the chief looks up with a weary face, cut to credits.  Was that supposed to be a joke?<br /><br />I really liked the first three episodes, this one is just frustrating.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I like all types of books as long as they keep me from putting them down...on that note I have to say the first half of this book was kinda slow and I almost gave up on it because it was wordy which annoyed me.  I AM SO HAPPY I KEPT READING... the second half of this book picked up and I could not put it down!  The second I finished Delirium I could not wait to start Pandemonium.  I enjoyed Delirium more than The Hunger Games and am looking forward for the 3rd book to come out in Feb 2013.

B004LWZW6U|4.0|The first \\"Piranha,\\" although it was very campy, with lots of excess T&A and what have you, never really was that much fun for me.  To me, it just wasn't that funny, even though everything was there.<br /><br />Here, everything is lighter and funnier.  It reminded me of a fun horror movie from the 80s, almost like one of those Troma movies.  Nothing is serious - but it's also not super witty.  It's just silly, idiotic fun.<br /><br />Sure, the plot is almost non-existent, but do yourself a favor and recognize what these critics that get featured on Rotten Tomatoes never do - that's not the point of this movie.  It's a fun summertime flick that's meant to give you some fun jump moments and never get too scary.<br /><br />I have to say, it's a shame that this didn't make it into more theaters.  I saw it in theaters by chance, but this was really a great movie to see in theaters.  It's all about the 3D and the fun environment.

145162445X|4.0|I have a deep and long abiding  interest in science  (especially Quantum Mechanics) but I have never formally studied the subject apart from the philosophy of science at undergraduate level. So I found some of the concepts a bit challenging. But the thesis is brilliant. Well written with a well reasoned clearly built up case. which finishes in the same void which the Buddha more than two millennium ago described as the origin of all things. Form is empty and emptiness is form said this wise old man. I feel sure having read his book that Lawrence Krauss would agree.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is the most amazing movie and it is awesome! It is amazing what our troops are taught to do in the line of fire and duty. How they sacrifice their own lives for those they are there to defend not to mention each other.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I don't know how many pages this \\"book\\" would have been if it were printed, I down loaded it for my Kindle, but I estimate about thirty pages so it does not deserve the word book.  However I would have paid full book price for it after it stepped me through the html/image process that had me flumoxed and virtually banging my head against my desk.  The booklet is more an instruction manual and very specific, no replacement of course for the skill needed to write good content in the first place but is does carefully take you through the process of getting your writing into Kindle format.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Awesome album. Rick Rubin is amazing. I cant wait for the next record.  Each track grips you; wonderful follow-up to Stadium Arcadia
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy was fantastic.  I really liked the convenience of having all three books in the same bundle; especially because I could not stop reading once I started. From the first chapter on, I was hooked.  Great thinking on your part!<br />I really enjoyed the story line and the characters. I enjoyed the humor and emails back and forth between Christian and Ana.  The made up words they used were too funny.<br />I have put the author on my favorite read list and can't wait for what she writes next.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I heard so much about it.  The idea of a young girl hooking up with a young billionaire sounded like a nice fantasy.  A little far fetched that this guy could be self made at such a young age and be totally hot in every way imaginable.  Anyone making it big usually lacks in the looks department, i.e; Bill Gates and the Facebook guy (his name escapes me)  The whole inner Godess thing seemed so corny to me and the way the writer describes how he touches her \\"sex\\".  I was like she was too much of a prude to call it a vagina or any of the various slang terms just to give it some edge.  I'm glad I didn't invest in book 2 and 3.  If you want some good erotica, look for the Happy Hooker.  It's an old best seller written by a high priced call girl from the 70's (found it in my parents room and that is how I learned about the birds and the bees!) after reading this, I downloaded a sample on my Kindle and it still stands up when compared to this drivel.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|This review is coming from someone who had very little experience with Star Trek before purchasing this product. I became interested in the show after watching the new movie [[ASIN:B002PMPTIO Star Trek (2009)]]. I've enjoyed other science fiction T.V. shows such as Stargate. At first, I was a little skeptical about the price, and I thought it seemed a little steep.<br /><br />However, I was wrong. This was worth every penny. This show is phenomenal, and the remastered special effects are especially fun. With 29 hour-long episodes, this is a great buy, actually. It's made myself and my wife into Trekkies, and we plan to buy and watch the rest of the Original Series, as well as subsequent series.
B003N11PZC|5.0|I've rewatched this episode many times because it has such great songs in it.  It features \\"Dream On\\" which is my all-time favorite performance on Glee.  Neil Patrick Harris sings this song with Mr. Schu.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|What is honestly not a bad game is ruined by the brutal combination of a purchase cost PLUS in game (near mandatory) purchases PLUS in-your-face ads. Surreptitious installation of OpenFeint may or may not be yet another strike against (personally, I don't mind OF, but many do) . Uninstalled, recommend to stay away from devs like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|cool sweet best game ever finally they put it on the kindle fire I hope every one can get it!!!!!!!
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|So i hate not knowing what is a good app compared to a crappy one because of all the fake reviews. I was wondering if we could do something about it. I know superman comments on every app, (although he's just trolling or trying to be funny) but I think if someone has an actual review, to cite something in someone else's review, so that for me at least, I would know it's from an actual person who has at least tried it, and not some corporate goon trying to give fake 5 stars to an app.<br /><br />So if there is anyone who regularly checks the faotd, can cite someone else's part in their review, it might make that review more predominant, and less likely a fake developer account.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|fantastic album! skrillex keepin it alive on his new EP. bangin album 4 workouts too! keeps ur adrenaline fired up. all tracks good on this album. if ura fan of skrillex, dub, d'n'b, house and/or techno, ull want this album.
0345803485|4.0|I had to check this out after all the buzz about this series.  Personally, book 1 was not my favorite.  I definitely liked Book 2 & 3 much better.  Book 1 I read over a few days periodically.  However, by the time I reached the end of it, I was anxious for Book 2, which I couldn't put down and then Book 3 was the same way. And personally now that I'm done, I miss the characters.  Don't expect a realistic book...I've read the reviews about the lack of realism.  If that's what you want, you will be disappointed.  However, if you are looking for a page turner with some endearing characters and is light reading, then you'll enjoy these books as much as I did. I wasn't overly thrilled with the ending of series, primarily because it felt abrupt and I truly wasn't ready to let the characters go.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|A necessary inconvenience that has to be used nowadays.  The product registration and installation of licenses is seamless.  It would really be nice for it to come in the smaller micro factor that's the new technology.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I love the fact that I can make checklists easily for grocery shopping. And I can also create documents and email them. The only quirk, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that are some emailing bugs. But this app works for my purposes.
0385344228|4.0|This is my most successful fiction read of the last year.  Not perfect, but a very high quality book, well written and cleverly plotted.  One of the few times that I closed the last page with a sense of satisfaction.
B007C3TVNA|2.0|NOT THE RAMSEYS!<br /><br />We Need to Talk About Kevin is an enganging thriller about an interesting topic I was always curious about, parents raising a clinical psychopath. However We Need to Talk About Kevin is lauded as 'disturbing' when really it's just manipulative, similar to another recent horror film The Woman (where all white males are violent rapists). The start of the film is engaging, as I couldn't really tell why Tilda Swanston was being treated like s*** but as the film feeds you more and more info it becomes more apparent what happened. ALSO similar to the Woman, it gets more blatantly stupid and manipulative as it progresses.<br /><br />Basically Kevin is a clinical sociopath from the start, the symptoms are there but in order for the script to work he has to be allowed to walk all over everyone in order to get away with it, new age parents must be eating this movie up. No one but Tilda Swanston picks up on his behaviors, even from birth Kevin is smart enough only to piss Tilda off and no one else. Even if he was so psychopathic that he was beyond help through meds and therapy the parents could've at least tried those options, but no, Kevin is a brilliant mastermind taking advantage of all the dummies in his life because that level of unrealism is 'disturbing' to some. So let's go over each character in the family and see why they're all wrong, stupid, and poorly written.<br /><br />The Father- Played by John C. Reily (nice to see him doing drama again), the father is an oblivious Fred Flinstone-esque idiot that wants a friend more than a son. He doesn't notice any wrong behaviors about his son who can manipulate him 24/7 for 16 years, and doesn't believe his wife or even address her concerns about Kevin being a sociopath. Also when the daughter goes to the hospital for bleach that was obviously poured into her eye (she wasn't using eyedrops then) he was more concerned about Kevin not feeling guilty than anything else. Bad parenting + poor writing = disturbing.<br /><br />Kevin- Kevin is a super-smart super-manipulative baby genius that has the ability to trick virtually everyone in the world except for his mother. Many times when he's with his dad he'll give an evil glance to Tilda, for no other reason than to show the audience that he's evil. If he was such a manipulative mastermind he wouldn't even need the spiteful glances, he was already doing a good job about ruining his mother's life. The writer/director must envy Kevin a bit since they clearly try to manipulate the audience and are getting away with it. He wasn't such a terribly written character though if you apply his sociopathy to him, however in a work of fiction Kevin is so manipulative/smart that he started from birth.<br /><br />The Mom- And mother of the year Tilda Swanson, who wouldn't know discipline if it hit her like a truck. In multiple, MULTIPLE scenes Kevin will test his mom, talking back to her or breaking something she loves and she just stares at him and goes 'yes dear'. When Kevin goes into her map-room and destroys everything in there, she knows that he did it to spite her, but what does she do? She takes it out on the paint gun in front of him, not slapping the little brat and giving him no dinner that night. Then later in the film after he poured bleach in his sister's eye instead of daddy doofus wondering if Kevin feels guilty, they both should've had him checked out by a psychologist, mabye look into why blood was coming out of the garbage disposal which was around the same time Snuggles the gerbil went missing.<br /><br />So many warning signs are blaring in the parent's faces and yet they take the worst possible decisions regarding their son, both ignoring his problem in their own way. So in that regard, I feel absolutely no sympathy for John C. Reily's fate, nor the hell that Tilda Swanston lived in after everything because she could've prevented it and had her son locked up or medicated years ago, or where she's living at she can just move. The only real victim in the family was the young daughter who was born into a family where the son's a psychopath and the parents are oblivious imbeciles.<br /><br />So yeah, the production values are excellent, the acting is phenominal, the music is strange and eerie, but the decisions the characters made are just downright stupid. It's like watching a family stuck in a room with water filling up, and the door is right behind them to get out but they just ignore that door the whole time, making this movie an overall frustrating experience. Many people have noted that there's no point to this movie, and I'm inclined to agree with them, unless you want to see a movie lightly skim the surface of how a parent copes with dealing with a psychopath for a son. If you want to see a maternal horror movie, watch Rosemary's Baby, if you want a more realistic and less stupid portrayl of psychopaths, look into Snowtown, and if you want to see this overall story done better, watch The Omen.e can just move.

0385738773|4.0|I read some reviews before I bought the 3rd book because I felt the first two were so a like and I didn't want to buy the 3rd one if it was just going to be more of the same. All of the reviews were saying that they felt like they didn't get answers to the questions from the first two books.  At this point I was really not going to buy it, but who am I kidding I had to finish and...<br /><br />I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about!  No they didn't answer every question from the first two, but I was very satisfied with what they did answer.  And maybe it was because I read the reviews and so I wasn't expecting much, but I think by the end you get the point of WICKED and what happened what role everyone probably played even if it isn't laid out.<br /><br />My only complaint was that I never felt enough attachment to the characters except for Thomas.  Especially between Thomas and Brenda or Thomas and Teresa.  I guess I felt for Minho and Newt too.  I wish I was more emotionally investment in all the characters because I would have cared more what happened to them in the end.<br /><br />Slight spoiler...<br /><br />One of the big complaints I read is that Thomas doesn't get his memories back so you don't know the role he played.  But I think that is the whole point.  Thomas didn't want his memories back, so if he doesn't want to remember the reader shouldn't know either. And they give you enough to go on that you can assume the role he played.

B005FITIDC|5.0|This is a movie that will shock you, touch your heart and make you want to 'do something.'  Sam Childers hits the depths as a human being,  finds redemption in God and rehabilitates himself.  As an act of Christian charity he goes to Africa to help with a building project.  As he visits relief camps in the Sudan, he is appalled at the attacks on innocent villagers especially the atrocities perpetrated on children.  He finds himself becoming more and more obsessed with saving as many children as he can.  He sells everything he owns,  depriving his own family so he can keep his orphanage going and take care of the children he has saved.<br /><br />All of the performances were superb,  there is wonderful chemistry between Gerard Butler and Michelle Monaghan who plays Sam's wife, Lynn.  Butler brings Sam Childers to the screen in all his bold, tough glory but he also brings the emotion that drives Sam.<br /><br />This movie touched my heart as no other has in years.

B005FPT51K|1.0|Set up is at best difficult even for the technically capable. Once setup, the device looses its connection too frequently to be considered reliable. The alarm that is supposed to activate when the connection is lost is significantly delayed, leaving those of us who rely on sounds from Baby to alert us of an issue unaware for several minutes that Baby is unmonitored.<br /><br />Motion & sound sensitivity settings are too limited, (too much or too little sensitivity) making this feature less than practical. After updating our iPhones & reinstalling the camera & software, the issues we thought we'd overcame continued. Then the App just stopped working all together, with an error message that our phones were no longer connected to the same WiFi they've been connected to for a year without issue. Hmm...<br /><br />I haven't got it in the mail yet, but found another option from (Light In The Box) called Wanscam - Wireless IP Surveillance Camera. With 451 positive reviews it claims to do everything the I Baby Monitor claims plus it allows you to view Baby from any smart phone or computer anywhere in the world. All you need is an internet connection, which removes WiFi limitations. At $46.99 each, it's not a difficult choice. Wish I had found it sooner.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|After a promising start, the story tends to become at times quite boring where endless descriptions of feasts, exotic dresses and useless genealogical trees fill page after page.  Gratuitous violence and descriptions with high shock value are abundant which makes me wonder whether the author truly believed in the worth of his storytelling and felt that this approach was necessary in order to keep the reader's interest alive.  I cannot say that I didn't like the story but certainly I cannot compare it to J.R.R Tolkien's work.

0345803485|1.0|I don't understand the hype for the book \\"Fifty shades of Grey\\". The author routinely professed on national TV that she; doesn't live the lifestyle, her only knowledge of the lifestyle is reading other authors and her only knowledge of toys was to go into a few shops and ask how to use different items. To me this is the equivalent of me telling you that since I can put gas in my car I am a master mechanic.

B005OK721G|1.0|The scoop: In Columbia, a family man is looking to get out of the drug business for reasons unclear. Of course, his boss says, \\"Sure, pal o' mine, just don't tell the drug police about me, ha ha!\\" Of course, anyone that's seen many crime movies -- including these characters -- knows that \\"the only way out is feet first, got that?\\" A hit squad is dispatched to eliminate the guy and his family.  The parents know the hit squad is en route--in fact, they spot them outside!--yet make NO effort to hide their 11-year-old daughter Cataleya as they approach. (Perhaps the real reason this couple was marked for death is because this drug kingpin realized this couple has crappy parenting skills.) Husband and wife are shot multiple times in front of the child.  Faster than you can say \\"Bruce Wayne,\\" she vows then & there to avenge her parents' murder and escapes. But Bruce Wayne trained for years and years in almost every physical discipline imaginable before he became Batman, THIS little girl has the moves of Daredevil and Angelina Jolie's Ms. Salt at the age of eleven, jumping from rooftop to rooftop to street, evading a crew of what must be between four and eight fully grown, heavily armed, presumably professional hitmen. (Cripes, what did they feed this kid?!?) We even see this child move a MANHOLE COVER like it's a pizza! (Gad, those things are heavy, really!) Then, from an unlikely confluence of events, Cataleya -- who is so special she reads Xena comic books YEARS before the hit TV show makes the airwaves, according to the film's timeline -- makes her way from Columbia to Miami to Chicago (most bus companies will let a pre-teen girl buy a ticket sans adult supervision), where she hooks up with her gangster uncle.  Uncle Thug, like all concerned relatives, honors his niece's burning desire to be trained as an assassin, provided she attends school regularly and kills the Kardashian sisters after turning 21. (OK, I made-up that last bit.)<br /><br />That was the prologue -- cut to the present, where the child has grown up to be Zoe Saldana. Ms. Saldana is indeed lovely, but let's be vaguely semi-real here. She looks like she weighs 94 pounds! She kicks an enormous amount of big-guy hiney and wields weapons that are almost as big as she is! Cagefighter-turned-actress Gina Carano, star of the recent Haywire, is a truly muscular lady -- you can believe that she can clean any guy's clock, punch his ticket, fix his wagon, and rotate his tires. Saldana looks like a stick figure...a very pretty stick figure I'll admit, but a stick figure nonetheless. Steve Buscemi could take her in a fight, and Buffy the V-Slayer could have her for breakfast. (I wouldn't bet the rent, but I think a MALE stunt-double was used in one fight scene).<br /><br />But wait, it gets better. [spoiler] I know this is an action film, not a documentary, but Starsky & Hutch feels more \\"real\\" than this movie. Early on, Cataleya gets herself arrested intentionally by pretending to be drunk and plowing her car into a police car. After she's arrested, the police don't give her a breathalyzer test, don't take her mugshot, and (best of all) don't take the hairpin in her, uh, hair with which she uses to unlock her cell door with ease!  (Do the CIA and NSA know of the awesome power of the pin, for MacGyver's sake?) [insert Andy Rooney voice here] Ever notice that in action movies ladies (and occasionally men) can run BAREfoot into sewers and over an assortment of rubble without stepping on something injurious?<br /><br />I like action movies as much as the next fellow, but I like some actual acting and characters (they're as generic as they come here) with my explosions and gunshots. Worst of all, there's NOTHING here that hasn't been done lots better before -- even the American La Femme Nikita remake Point of No Return is better than this.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I purchased this game. It does not show up on the Kindle, neither on the device nor on the cloud. Went into the store on the kindle and it shows it is not purchased. Went to the website on the computer and bank account, both confirmed that this game was purchase. There is no option on amazon.com to send the game to the kindle device. There is an option for all my other purchases.<br /><br />Based on the above, is it safe to assume that this game is no longer available?<br /><br />Modified the review. Amazon took more than 4 hours from purchase to allow it to be downloaded ... I do not know why Amazon took such a long time, but ... I hope this doesn't become a standard at Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addictive. Can't stop playing it.  Just would be nice to have the choice of a female character at the beginning rather than having to earn one.
B007HNFZOY|5.0|This season was incredible, and my favorite character is Tyrion Lanister. Peter Dinklage is the star of the show, in my opinion. But the overall character development is spectacular, with the end of each show leaving me hungry for the next. And then we have dragons! Keep it up, Game of Thrones. However, HBO: make HBOGO available to everyone! How dumb can you guys get and still breathe? Open it up! I'd pay $20 a month for it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is free,  completely awesome and addicting. the game lags at times but is hardly noticeable unless  u die unexpectedly or are at a high score where u cannot move as well....but it lasts for like 2 seconds and i love this game!

B000NA2BEU|5.0|While I agree with many that Season 3 was less strong than Seasons 1 and 2, and might rate it a 4.5 against solid 5s for those seasons, I definitely still rate this DVD as a 5 star in the broader scheme of television series.<br /><br />The writing is excellent and the acting top notch and the mysteries, while not as fabulous as the season long arcs in the first two seasons, are still engaging and compelling with some great characters and mysteries of the week along the way.<br /><br />Rob Thomas provides a whole lot of commentary, which makes for many, many interesting insights.  The EXTRAs are smart and entertaining in their own right.  Watching the Season 4 pitch and looking at so many of the procedurals that do get aired makes me sad that this one could not get picked up somewhere.<br /><br />Still and all, I am grateful for all the Veronica Mars that DOES exist.  I have watched and rewatched all three seasons of Veronica Mars and I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue and wit and interactions of the Neptune crew in all three of them, this last college season included. (I most emphatically do NOT agree that they should have stopped at high school graduation).<br /><br />Veronica Mars remains a strong and smart character.  She has trust issues and she makes mistakes.  I did not find her to be unduly mean in this season.  Flawed and, at times, humbled, but not a \\"mean girl\\".  Logan could be a bit mopey and emo at times, but, really, for such a coddled rich boy to be in his first year out of high school, floundering a bit does not seem unrealistic.  And there were still flashes of his strength, vulnerability, wit, and passionate personality.  I think that perhaps for budgetary reasons, many of the other cast members were cut back in their appearances, and their presence was missed. Veronica's relationship with her dad remains the heart of the show and continues to be wonderful.<br /><br />I came to really like the new characters and thought Veronica and Parker in particular had really great friend chemistry as the season got rolling.  SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />I think it would have been more fun to build on their friendship than throw Parker and Logan together.  Piz had the unenviable and perhaps Herculean task of winning over viewers as a Veronica love interest more compelling than Logan.  Much like Parker, he was a more engaging and intersting character when not encumbered with the love triangle storyline and able to just be a friend in the mix.  It might have been fun to see a Piz and Logan friendship emerge rather than a Piz and Veronica romance.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />For me, this DVD has been worth every penny and is one that stands up to repeated viewings.  The wit and humor still make me smile and this show forever remains a favorite for me.
B005KELW26|4.0|I bought my Kindle Fire at the end of April and got this case about a week later.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons first:<br />Yes, the price is ridiculous.  If I were to price it, I would say $15, maybe $20.  The cover is fairly thin, and I wouldn't trust it to protect my Kindle from breaking if I dropped it a large distance.<br /><br />With that being said...<br /><br />I don't plan on dropping my Kindle a large distance (and I have yet to do so).  I did buy a thicker case (for only $8 at TJ Maxx) that I kept my Kindle in before I bought this case, and, admittedly, it would work better if I needed a thicker case...but this case works just fine.  I carry it around in my purse with my keys and other junk, and I don't worry about the safety of my Kindle.  The color is nice, and I really like the magnetic fastener.  There is a small folder pocket on the inside to put papers or whatnot, although I don't use it.  The cover is flexible, allowing me to fold it back behind the Kindle when I am using it.  My Kindle is nice and secure in the elastic straps inside, so there's no risk of it falling out.<br /><br />Overall, the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price, which really is the average price you have to pay for a Kindle case.  (And this is where the companies are taking advantage of cautious Kindle owners who don't want their $199 Kindles to become scratched.)  This case is just what you need to protect your Kindle Fire, as long as you aren't a clumsy person who drops her nice toys.  :)<br /><br />******<br />Update 10/28/13<br /><br />I still have my case and it's still in decent condition, especially considering it travels in my purse with my keys and other odds n' ends.  I still would recommend this case for anyone who is not clumsy.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I played it all the way on a 7hr car ride almost the whole time. and back and I'm still not done but I do recommend fixing the LAG (glich)
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoyed this game but I must admit I was a little overwhelmed. A lot of ground to cover. I like to figure out all the clues myself but I had to check the hints a few times when I was lost.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|the game is a blast the people who don't play it are relly missing out big time just a relly fun game relly fun
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really enjoyed figuring out all the clues. Not too hard where you get frustrated but just right to get the brain juices flowing.
B002SEW5WW|4.0|The melodies in almost every song are heart-wrenching and feel alive.  Unfortunately, the music stops there.  The lyrics aren't as deep as the songs themselves are, limiting it to being good, but not amazing.  Good work and an awesome album.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|Enigma is an electronic music group founded in the 1970s, by Michael Cretu. Its vocal & instrumental music is best described as World Beat or New Age Downtempo, with an eclectic touch. It uses Gregorian chants and sexual innuendos, set to a dance beat, whilst vocalising philosophical themes like life after death. The cover designs of their albums are invariably evocative of Gregorian friars, in the garb of monks, their faces hidden below the monk's hood - hence the emergence of the mysterious Enigma that is the name of this music group. The track that shot Enigma to fame is 'Sadeness Part 1.'<br /><br />The Platinum Collection is a 3 cd- set consisting of Greatest Hits; the Remix Collection and the Lost Ones - the latter being so called because these tracks were 'lost in the mists of time' - they remained unpublished till this album was released in the open market. This collection is superbly intriguing and enigmatic - in fact, it nicely rounds off all the tracks of Enigma's music career. The tone of each cd is rich, smooth and mellow - it is positively fantastic when played loud and equally soothing when played soft....this collection is the Ultimate that you can possess - it is legendary in excellence and a true masterpiece in its own right! Just go for it!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had this in my movie queue for over two months, then decided to just give it a try since I usually love these English period peices. This was no exception. I LOVED IT!!  The acting, the story, the music, the use of the different color filters to depict the differences in the locations. A blue-grey filter for the harsh, hardness of Milton, and the rich full  spectrum filter for Halston and London. Perfect!  The story was wonderfully done and was realistic in the realities of  life in an industrial English town, but yet it wasn't overboard to bring a sense of depression and gloom to the entire production. I first saw that this was listed as a 'first season' type thing, then happily realized it really isn't a SHOW, just a mini-series of sorts. The movie is closed up beautifully at the end of the 4th installment. LOVED it, highly recommend it!  =) I'm going to look in my local library for the book, although I've heard the movie follows it very closely, and some scenes they added actually make the story smoother then the book originally had. If you like movies like Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensability, Persuasions, and their like...you WILL love this.
B0086700CM|5.0|wasn't going to get into this game like others did but once I started playing I couldn't stop. awesome game. so glad the droid market finally picked it up. works great on my kindle fire.
0345803485|1.0|This book is ridiculous.  I keep reading (by skipping over the pages and pages and pages of stupid sex) to see if I can find a plot somewhere.  It is a totally unbelievably story that is not well written and has very little plot.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|sorry this is not a mmo. pay to play / micro transactions is NOT acceptable at all for a paid app unless it is a mmo!!!!!! in witch is bad as open fient or not compatable with LG phones.. sorry dev's get a freaq<br />kiing clue!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|After reading all of the negative reviews I feel like I have to say something about these books!  I was very hesitant to read 50 Shades.  I'm not typically a romance reader, but there was so much hype that I caved.  From the very beginning I was hooked!  Maybe the writing isn't the best, but no one I know is buying this book for the quality literature.  This is a sexy, make you blush, turn you on, type of book.  It's hot and I couldn't put it down.  I sat in my living room blushing as I read it, and I couldn't put it down.  I teach elementary and I sat at school trying to teach, but all I could think about was Christan Grey.  I felt like a 21 year old again, with a major crush on a guy who doesn't even exist.  Don't buy this book if you're looking for the next pulitzer winner, but if you want an exciting escape from reality then I highly suggest it - and like I said, this is coming from someone who has never bought a \\"romance\\" novel ever.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie was very frightening, but I think, also very educational.  Psychopaths make up between 1-3% of our population, and this as a VERY accurate and terrifying presentation of what they are actually like.  I thought this movie was very well acted, and extremely eerie, but definitely worth seeing.  If you happen to meet someone that reminds you of Kevin: RUN!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I very much enjoy this game. I couldn't stop play this game for like 3 hours. I would recommend this to everyone!
0345803485|4.0|I have to be honest with this book. It was recommended to me a while back before I started hearing 50 shades, 50 shades everywhere. I am a true crime lover or books with that type of theme. I know this is probably TMI but I have a great sex life so I do not shy away from books because I am a prude or whatever the reason some people might not like books of this nature. It's just USUALLY not my style.<br />Then I started reading this book and I have to say, the first 100 pages I was having trouble getting through I was rolling my eyes and thinking - what the heck???? THe word \\"crap\\" and my \\"inner goddess\\" was almost a little nauseating - like FOR REAL???<br />But I ventured on - why, I really don't know because usually If I'm on page 100 and am not digging the book I will just put it away and leave it for another day but something kept me going. I got to THE END the very end and I realize that though the writing is not going to win awards on writing alone, (especially the beginning OMG does the author repeat herself again and again) I found myself liking it more and more!!<br />SO then I get to the second book 50 shades darker and I am REALLY liking it...I've read a lot of reviews because of the fascination with this book I am curious always with something this popular as to why it is so popular and I tend to study the book and it's mass affect on people almost as much as I do read it. I've read the bad reviews and the writing comes up consistently, which I have to agree with. I am very surprised and agent took this on. Only because the writing is almost adolescent in nature. But I have to admit. I have become hooked.<br />I never thought I would for a book like this and for those who complao it's not hard core enough or not accurate with the world of S/M, etc. I don't think that was the point of the book. I have known men like Christian in my life - gorgeous men who break hearts with recklass abandon yet women will do just about ANYTHING to hold onto them though eventually, they find their hearts ripped to shreds - that could be a point of contention - a man like Christian in real life would toy with this girl and stomp on her to death. LOVE - good lord BUT that's not the point of the book - the point is to entertain and entertain it does - as surprising at it is for me to change my original post of not liking this book - I have to say I've changed my mind. I am into fifty shades.....tually, they find their hearts ripped to shreds - that could be a point of contention - a man like Christian in real life would toy with this girl and stomp on her to death. LOVE - good lord BUT that's not the point of the book - the point is to entertain and entertain it does - as surprising at it is for me to change my original post of not liking this book - I have to say I've changed my mind. I am into fifty shades.....
0062197258|4.0|Catherine is a party girl who enjoys the single lifestyle. When she meets Lee, she is immediately attracted to him and they strike up a relationship. Lee seems wonderful and her friends are all envious of their relationship. But gradually, Catherine starts to find the relationship claustrophobic. Lee starts questioning her about her movements, spying on her, trying to control her. We know from the book's prologue that things are going to go very wrong, but it's not clear exactly how it's going to happen.<br /><br />Meanwhile in a parallel storyline, we are also following a vastly different Catherine some four years down the track - one who is crippled by anxiety and OCD, finds it impossible to open up to anyone and who has clearly been through a horrific experience. A new man has come into her life, but can she trust him? And is she safe from Lee?<br /><br />What's great about this book is the rising tension throughout. There are some small twists and surprises along the way, but overall it's evident that we are building towards some kind of climax - it's just not sure what that will be. The suspense grew so strong that I literally couldn't put it down for the final 100 pages. Up until that point though, I did feel that it was a little too drawn out. Having said that, I liked the way the gradual shifts in Lee and Catherine's relationship - and her gradual recovery in the later story - were portrayed.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this, I strongly recommend [[ASIN:1408809133 The Bed I Made]], another (equally tense) book about a relationship gone sour.
B0086700CM|5.0|I looooove this game. The challenge is great and I am soooooo ADDICTED!!!!!!  YOU GOTTA JUST GOTTA GET IT!!!!!!!!!  This game rocks.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun they should have another one then it would be even more fun then the first one
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book certainly is not the type of book that I find myself reading on a regular basis but I am happy that I chose it and decided to complete it. I found myself blushing the majority of the time while reading but this is a very interesting author leaving me to strongly believe that I will continue on to read book 2 of this trilogy completely based on sex! If your looking for something different, interesting, and a good book to keep you wondering, this is the book for you.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|So I read the reviews before buying, took special note of the instructions \\"Go to \\"STUFF\\" then hit options and the Kindle arrow will come up on the bottom. Now you can go back to your home screen without having to shut down your Kindle Fire.\\"  Did **not** work!  I tried twice to get this method to work and not get stuck in the game, no luck.  Uninstalled the app within 20 minutes of installing.  What a crock!  AMAZON:  FIX THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This movie was so bad that it's hard to find words to adequately describe its total ineptitude.<br />They had a couple of good ideas (barely), then added so much fluff that the gems of an idea or two were lost in the shuffle.<br />The actors either shouted or mumbled their way through their lines, and the whole thing turned into one huge jumbled up mess.<br />As for the so-called music!  Yuck!
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|The game os fluent, and the graphics are good, but it gets old.  Slow-Motion gets used fast, and you have to pay for more.  Miniclip is wanting more money, by we don't have to give it.  SERIOUSLY, WHATS IS WRONG WITH OPENFEINT?  ARE THERE COMPLAINTS ON GAMECENTER?
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best headset I have ever owned. There are a few issues with the lastest software and I have to run the older legacy versions to get my profiles to work correctly but other than that the sound Quality and funtionality are great.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|This is an unbelievable DVD.  If you like to hear GREAT Guitar playing then you will love this!!!  Joe Rocks!!  I put him right up there with SRV and Eric Clapton.  I believe he is actually better then EC.
B002QYSZBO|4.0|I viewed this film for a film class focusing on the history of gangster and detective movies.  It was shown as illustrative of the post modern noir detective genre.  All performances were top notch, but that of Robert Downey Jr. was superb.  There is no better actor performing today in my view.
B00417HV14|5.0|This is the beat Guitar DVD I have ever purchased.  I love the song Woke Up Dreaming! However' this DVD is packed with GREAT songs and highly Entertaining!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one amazingly fun book to read. I couldn't put it down, as with all of her books. Great, great story and characters. Many twists and turns that keep you reading on the edge of your seat. Buy it!
B0086700CM|5.0|you should get this. app it is awesome. there is all was action at every corner you have to be fast with your fingers.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. I love this author and all three of her books are amazing. This book keeps you confused and on the edge of your seat with all of its twists and turns. This is a must read! You will not be disappointed. Great book!
