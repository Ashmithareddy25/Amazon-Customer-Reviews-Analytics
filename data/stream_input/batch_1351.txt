B0078KCTXQ|5.0|Rumple... er... Mr. Gold really shines!  I love the fact that this episode focuses mostly on his story so we see what motivates him.  The Belle and Beast angle is very well done! I won't give away anything ... you'll just have to watch. :)  Once Upon a Time gives just enough \\"cliff hangers\\" to get you hooked without being overly cheesy about it.  This is by far my favorite series this season. (Hint, hint ABC... please give us a season 2!)
0385342063|5.0|Poppy Wyatt's day is really going badly.  She has lost the antique betrothal ring her fianc&eacute; Magnus gave her and her phone has been stolen.  She thinks her luck has changed when she finds a perfectly good phone stuck in the waste bin and so she confiscates it.  The phone rings, she answers it pretending to be an automated reply, listens to a cryptic message, and writes it down on an old Lion King program.<br />The phone belongs to Sam Roxton ( or his PA) and he lets Poppy know that he wants the phone back but she refuses.  She agrees that she will forward all of his messages until she no longer needs the phone.  Thus begins a relationship that is quirky to say the least.  As Poppy gets more and more into Sam's life via his phone, she starts meddling with good, and sometimes bad, results. In the meantime, Poppy is dealing with the lost ring, her not so happy future in-laws, and a bridal planner from h*ll.<br />Sam helps with the ring debacle and little by little Poppy becomes part of his life. Sam has some heavy stuff going on at his workplace which Poppy may be able to help him with. There are some interesting twists towards the end of the book.<br />This is a lovely story of two people literally falling into love.  There is sweetness to the relationship which makes the story easy to read. Both characters are likeable (maybe not Sam at first) and they find themselves leaning on each other for support with their problems. The secondary characters are fleshed out and add a lot to the book.  I especially liked the little footnotes on the bottom of the pages.<br />This is my favorite Kinsella book since Can You Keep a Secret.
B0076D20E8|3.0|Some minor spoilers included:  I don't often pause a movie, but I had no problem doing so during this one.  There were plenty of \\"dramatic pauses\\" during which to do so.  The movie is full of political supposition and apparently the writer loved the idea of Elizabeth I having multiple bastard children.  The life of William Shakespeare, as the summary suggested this film to be about, could be condensed into about 45 minutes of this over 2 hour tale.  I feel I am being generous suggesting his life got that much screen time. Even the plays are allotted minimal time.  \\"William Shakespeare\\" is a con-man of a con-man (Johnson), paid by a con-man of sorts; he being the noble artist himself.  William is a drunken, rather stupid and greedy actor, Johnson a blundering coward and our noble writer seems to want to back a successor to Elizabeth I but we are never really told his motives (other than the obvious distrust of James of Scotland).  If you enjoy seeing grown men cry over the silliest of matters, watch Anonymous.  If you enjoy seeing Elizabeth I portrayed as less than the strong, independent, fierce Tudor queen she was known to be, watch Anonymous.  If you want a movie to watch while you are cleaning, doing a hobby or otherwise entertained, watch Anonymous.  Rent this from Redbox or wait until Amazon offers it as a free or $1.00 movie.  It's not worth full price.

0812974611|4.0|For the most part, I enjoyed the book and learned a lot about this period in time.  There were a few instances in the book that I didn't enjoy reading, but otherwise, it was good.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Awesome game!  Its good to have to think when playing a game once and awhile.  Highly recommend!! Will check out more games by hidden variable studios.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was expecting mediocrity when I heard Van Halen had a new album coming out.  Hearing \\"Tattoo\\" for the first time scared me into thinking I was right.  \\"Tattoo\\" grew on me after the 3 time through and now I really like it.  There isn't a bad song on the album.  6 or 7 of them are just plain awesome.  This album isn't as good as Van Halen (first album) or Fair Warning, but it is comparable to the rest of the Roth era albums.  If you even remotely like Van Halen at all, this is a must purchase.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am VERY pleased with my Kindle Lightweight MicroShell Folio cover! I was able to put it on easily and have not removed it since. It is light weight, snug in fit and stand is sturdy enough for my 4 year old and I to use without resetting moments. The price is very fare. I feel so much better having my Kindle-toy protected at all times! A brillant purchase.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Although its difficult at times this game is GREAT, credit to Hidden Variable Studios for making such a fantastic game.
B002BWP49C|2.0|This movie took so long to get anywhere I thought I was going to fall asleep.  I actually think the first one was better and that's saying something, since it's budget was way less than this one.  Maybe they should have not made it two parts, then the honeymoon wouldn't have made me so sleepy.  I guess I was hopeing the films would get better, the books weren't bad, but this movie proves there not going to.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great app. sometimes I read on my phone even though my kindle is within reach. I recommend this app for any book lover.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great little game with cute characters. It's tetris meets veggie tales. You can't help but chuckle. Now I'm bagging groceries in my sleep!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Simply put, this is the best novel that I have read in quite a while.  I am not sure why.  I have read some of the negative reviews and while I can see their points, they just simply did not apply to me. I really enjoyed this book.  I think a big factor in my enjoyment was that I just simply read a story.  I didn't get involved in all this analysis, this second guessing the author.  In fact it was like there was no author.  It was just a story and it took me to a more innocent time in my youth where I read a book for the pure joy of reading story and not feeling manipulated by the author.  Perhaps the best authors are those who quietly write the book and slip out of the story and leave you and the story to your own devices.  Excellent.  In my own rating system of 1 to 10 stars (and there ain't no 10s) it got a nine--meaningless perhaps, but rarer than a Pulitzer prize.  I don't remember the last novel I gave a 9, it might have been the Grapes of Wrath.
B0016OOM7Q|3.0|The 3LP came as stated in the description but the w/cd part did not come with, the package was not seperated on the billing or shipping, false advertising and empty promisses for the price
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using Youversion's Bible products since they started.  It was the first thing I put on my Aneroid phone, and the first app I put on my Fire.  I would never think of having a mobile device without a copy of Youbersion on it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but kind of hard you have to complete levels before you can play more games and I'm kind of only typing this so I can get the free points
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I picked up this game today and I'm enjoying it so far.  It's challenging and cute.  You need to arrange food items in the grocery bag to avoid damaging anything.  You can also put certain items together to get bonuses.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just downloaded this on my kindle fire and I have had a blast playing it. Some levels are challenging but that is what makes it fun. I really like the old.school games.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is an addicting physics puzzle game.  The characters are cute and the game is challenging.  The ads get kind of annoying after awhile so it might be worth getting the paid version.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books. I am about to reread them. It is a great story and paints a great picture of the world they live in.
B005T87QCI|4.0|where is atom and zues, they are like the main characters of the movie, but other than that, I have this game also for the xbox 360, but I find this one more fun because it is more challenging. also I find this one better because it has ambush and the other robots from the movie.  the only thing bad is zues. and atom
B0050VI5SI|1.0|I have no idea why this group has received such strong ratings?  The only popular songs on the album is \\"pumped up kicks\\", which I can only guess people like because they can hum along to the song and not really listen to anything the band is saying.  The song is about a Robert, who gets a revolver out of his dad's closet and then starts shooting other kids.  The chorus of the song is telling the other kids to out run his bullets with the pumped up kicks.  I am at a loss why people would find a song about kids getting shot catchy, unless no one is bothering to listen to the lyrics?  The rest of the music on the album is pretty forgettable after giving it a listen.  Save your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game for passing the time especially if you are into some of the older games very amazing game for younger kids

B005KELW26|4.0|This Kindle Fire case is attractive and protects the KF well.  With discounts, I only paid around $11, so that was a good deal as well.  Thanks.
0765357151|4.0|For a book written in the mid-fifties, it reads like it could have happened yesterday. The book seems like a great study in 3rd person limited and hits on every kind of emotional high and low a man who is alone would probably experience. The fights scenes between him and the vampires were absolutely awesome and it felt like I was right there along with Robert Neville (the protagonist) kneeing a vampire in the face, hitting them with his car as he scurried back to the house, or shooting them in the face. Matheson has a great use of realism and while the book has some really cliche events (that I won't go into here), they still all work. In the end, you're sort of floored from the powerful combination of good writing and imagination. If you want a book that pretty much haunts you even after you have read it, then check this book out. It's worth it. And oldie but goodie that delivers.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop has allowed me to stop carrying my laptop all together. I now have everything I need all the time with Splashtop and my Acer Iconia A500.  Great job, devs!

B006PHD0RW|3.0|2ND UPDATE:  I did note the developer's comment that Open Feint should \\"ask\\" for your participation before the game loads.  So, I uninstalled the app, then reinstalled it.  The Open Feint file on the SD card was deleted along with the uninstall.  I opened the app, and it did not ask me anything about Feint, and I played a game or two.  Then, while the game was still open, I went to my Files Folder.  The Feint folder was there, again with all the junk in it.  I then DELETED the Feint Folder, feeling that if it didn't ask, it sure didn't need the Feint Folder.  I exited the game, then re-entered.  THIS time (again, the SECOND launch of the app), the Feint logo popped up, stating \\"loading Feint.\\"  It was at this point I realized \\"loading\\" meant \\"putting back all the files  in the folder you deleted,\\" because after clicking \\"No, I don't want to have any fun\\" (the Feint decline button), I then was allowed into the game, but went back to the Files Folder, and there again was the Feint folder, loaded once again with all its garbage.  Therefore, this app will not operate without the user allowing Feint to automatically download and keep the 2mb worth of junk files on your phone.  Of note, I DID take this opportunity to try the second way of rotating objects, pressing the item and tapping elsewhere.  This worked a little better than the twisting finger method, which for me hardly worked at all.  The second method, however, worked about 75% of the time, often favoring certain types of taps over others, but I have yet to figure that out exactly.  I probably would have played this game with the second tap method, but Feint repeatedly forcing its files onto the phone of a user that deliberately opted out of Feint on the app is just unforgivable on Feint's part, not the developer.  Now that I fully realize how Feint operates, and that perhaps many developers don't realize what happens with the downloaded files even when their users reject the Feint option, I'm hoping developers that actually know what it does take this into consideration when deciding whether or not to permit Feint to take up some real estate in their app.  I'm putting the review at 3 stars ONLY due to the developer's responsiveness and genuine interest in helping their users.  But I sure hope they consider takiing Feint out in the future, because it would be a much better app without it.  1ST UPDATE:  Attempted to try the developer's helpful suggestion on just touching the object and tapping elswhere for an object to rotate, so I REBOOTED (since I only opened the app once after install) to give it a fresh, clean start.  To my surprise, as soon as I opened the app, I got a screen saying \\"LOADING FEINT.\\"  It hung there for a couple of minutes, so I went to check my FILES folder, and there it was:  the infamous 2mb FEINT FOLDER full of its junk.  It did not ASK me if I wanted to participate in Feint -- it just downloaded it onto my phone upon the second opening of the app.  In all fairness, I tried to ignore the Feint inclusion because I read it was \\"optional.\\"  This was no option, this was forced into the phone, and I don't care to know if there are settings to combat this because the Feint 2mb file will always install itself if the app doesn't find it there upon launching.  FORCED FEINT IS A DEAL BREAKER.  Therefore, I can not test the workaround to the touch screen issue.  Sorry to have to uninstall what otherwise was an app with great potential.  FIRST REVIEW:  This would have been a 5-star app if not for the poor touch screen responsiveness while trying to rotate objects.  If you're lucky enough to get it rotated before placing it in the bag, it turns around all by itself when placing it in the bag, and quickly trying to re-rotate just doesn't work.  Also, as far as I can tell, objects can't be removed from the bag once placed there. You can only adjust what's in there already, but oftentimes it's impossible to do anything to adjust.  You find yourself sitting there waiting for the round to end, or just have to press the \\"do over\\" button prematurely.  I was going to give it one star due to it being totally unplayable with these flaws, but I'll hold out awhile to see if the developer improves the rotate function before lopping off another star.  Too bad, seemed like it could be a fun game otherwise.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Considering the book world is overpopulated with ghosts, witches and vampires, it's refreshing to find a book that introduces new twists to old myths.  The Supernatural world is given a facelift in book one of an exciting new series that has more twists and turns than you can count.  This book will draw you in.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton is a talented addition to the Urban Fantasy genre.  She has an excellent voice and really knows how to spin a tale.  She has created some great new characters.  It'll be interesting to see where she takes Sophia Parsons as the saga continues.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|There is much to praise in the Australian production of LND. Unfortunately the music is not among them. First this show looks INCREDIBLE. Set design, lighting and costuming give the show a wonderful fantastic eerie look. Song wise nothing stayed with me. One song has a huge build up the Phantom has written an amazing song for Christmas the singing of which will have very serious consequences the tune though well sung is only adaquate and so is a huge let down. Also the story is as ludicrous as the original Phantom (maybe be more so) but because the songs are average it was more difficult to suspend disbelief. I found it hard to believe the sequence of events leading to the finale and I found the outcome improbable too. None of this is the fault of the impeccable cast who sing and smoulder well! Credit to the Australian team for doing such a good job with this material. The DVD is beautifully filmed balancing between making it clearly a filmed musical with the correct sets and lighting and using close ups etc to heighten drama on a TV screen.   Keen ALW fans and those interested to see how effective filming a musical can be may be interested,just don't be surprised if the music falls a little short of expectation.
0061122416|5.0|This book is literally a life changer. I decided to get it because my role model Will Smith said it was one of his favorite books, and sure enough it's mines too. It's not only because Will Smith likes it but because its an all around great book. The message, story, and length are great... Oh I forgot to mention I don't usually like reading books because instead of visualizing what's going on in the book, I tend to see word on paper and that's boring but not in this case... This book took me on the journey of the main character and I definitely related to him.  This book is worth getting, oh and I finished it in four days... I've never stuck with a book for that long, and I am now on the journey to find my \\"personal legend.\\"

B004PGO25O|1.0|The first page of the book, after the preface, lists the 'enemies' of accomplishing your goals.  Number two is 'Rational Thought'.  \\"Surely he doesn't mean rational thought as I understand it...\\" I think to myself, and keep reading.  Well, sure enough, he goes on to explain each of the three 'enemies', and number two really is rational thought.  'Turn off your logical, cognitive brain, and rely on instinct and emotion to guide you.'  Absolute rubbish, and into the rubbish goes this steaming pile or modern day pseudo-intellectual crap.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br /> I see some looters have given my review unfavorable marks.  Do yourselves a favor: go read 'Atlas Shrugged', then read 'The Virtue of Selfishness'; and then tell me 'Do the Work' is good and moral.
0439023483|5.0|Thanks for shipping my book in a timely manner. I just finished this book and it was great. I just ordered the other 2 books from amazon. I don't know if it was the same person as before but thanks again!

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Perfect in Blue ray I love the picture quality.  Three movies in one case is perfect to entertain all day.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Excellent game and finally a new concept and not just a retread of an old format (at least I've never seen it before).  The graphics are pretty and the character animation is fun. The only feature I wish for is to be able to turn off the music while keeping the sound effects on.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|app worked no glitches. only thing I didn't like was not being able to delete files I was done with.
B000H8RVUW|3.0|This review applies to the Rhino 180-gram vinyl reissue. The mastering and pressing is for the most part excellent: almost worth the $80.00 sellers are asking here for the remaining sealed copies still available. However, there are some mechanical flaws potential buyers should at least be aware of.<br /><br />The first is a problem in the lead-in area of both sides, where the stylus wants to skid down across and into into the playing area, landing partially in the beginning of the first song. This is caused by an excessive slope in the lead-in groove area. (This on a carefully-adjusted Rega turntable, with antiskate set as perfectly as I can get it.)<br /><br />The second is in the packaging, which carefully reproduces the original. The printed inner sleeve is too small. It can't accomodate the provided plastic-lined inner sleeve, and it can't even accomodate smaller Discwasher-VRP-style sleeves. This means you are guaranteed a real struggle to fit the printed sleeve, the record sleeve and the lyric insert back into the outer sleeve. Cursing ensues.<br /><br />Again, a really creditable mastering and pressing job marred by silly mechanical flaws.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I love this movie. I wanted to add it to my collection. The movie came in good condition, just as advertised. I haven't had a chance to rewatch it, but I know its good.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have no problems rating as \\"love it\\", although I don't know how influential the cd is ultimately going to be. Get the deluxe version. What's it like? Well, indie pop. Some cite \\"gangsta\\" influences (occassional rapping, and more frequent vocal sampling as a backing). Some cite John Barry (the James Bond film scorer) for some of the lush orchestral backings. While LDR is the compositional center, the cd lists plenty of co-writers to achieve these effects. In terms of comparable artists, Sade or k.d.lang have at least a similar retro-sensibility. What I mean is that although these artists would sing these songs very differently, they would probably be comfortable with most of them. Also like those artists, some of LDR's best tracks (Born to Die, Off to the Races) make the rest of pop music sound lame. Song topics range from socially observant (e.g., \\"Carmen\\", \\"National Anthem\\"), autobiographical (\\"This is what makes us girls\\"), self-referential (\\"Radio\\", ironic, as it won't be played on the radio because of the f-bombs), and the usual enduring love, unrequited love (\\"blue jeans\\", \\"video games\\").  You either love or hate LDR's vocal style. She has at least a 3 octave range and a lot of different vocal personalities. Sometimes she's nasally-muted and low (\\"Blue jeans\\", \\"Summertime sadness\\") and sometimes almost chipmunkish (Diet Mtn Dew, Off to the races), and inbetween. I'm hoping these aren't \\"auto-tuner\\" experiments but reflects someone who really has these vocal chops and likes to explore singing with them. The vocal contrasts also help keep the songs interesting on re-listening. I was impressed to hear the pre-\\"debut\\" cd would be re-released this summer. See the Wikipedia entry for Lana Del Rey for track info and see youtube to actually hear some of it. These songs are more experimental (Brite Lites), bluesy (Yayo), or just plain weird (Smarty), again with lots of inbetween. I wasn't put off by her willingness to experiment; the results were often quite good. I think there's plenty of room inside her music for these different kinds of artists. I just wish the music industry and critics felt the same way.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I did alot of looking around on the web prior to buying this item. The reviews helped me out, I knew what to expect when getting this. I like to read in bed alot so I knew that the folding option might not work too well on the bed...the few times I've done this, I just set it up and don't move it a whole lot. I like having the elastic portion when I read, its not super tight so that I could keep my hand there and not have it move, but it does help me hold it anyway. Very durable, I would recommend this to my friends and order more, just wish they had it in more colors, I wanted the white one, until I saw how it looks when it gets \\"used\\" so I went with the gray one. Still love it c:
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I have Kate's \\"The Dreaming\\", \\"The Sensual World\\", and then most recently 50wfs, which I have listened to repeatedly. The CD is unconventional relative to that past work (perhaps even to Aerial, \\"honey sky\\", which I've heard on occasion). Kate's eclectism and lyricism shows up as a mixture of melancholic slow-tempoed jazz (Misty) combined with modern classical styles (Lake Tahoe). I'm reminded of Rorem, Glass, and Schubert, when I listen to some of the tracks, and I'm thinking this is going to make her unpopular, but if you like classical *and* popular music, you should like this. Lake Tahoe stands out as being the most composed. Her use of small chorus to set a spooky and bittersweet mood is outstanding, as is her singing. Among Angels is outstanding because she sings the most radiantly and concentratively there. It is also a fairly concise song, somewhat bluesy, but in a Kate sort of way (not like a generic blues song). It's also the only song that doesn't have the word \\"snow\\" in it (I don't know if that's meaningful or not). Snowed in at Wheeler Street is outstanding because of Elton John and this is another very concise song. I don't think EJ was hamming it up or overblown but was being precisely directed. He has an impressive sustained note toward the end of the song which he does very well, but with not much left to spare. I can well imagine him saying to Kate: \\"You want me to do what#@!\\". Misty is the last standout in my mind, probably because of the story. It is a nice example of reaching an emotional crescendo (one of several on the cd). The last line of this song is particularly disturbing. The other songs are good, they just don't wow me like the ones mentioned. The physical CD has lyrics set in pages with photograph-like illustrations of snow carvings, suggesting a kind of children's book, but given the lyrics and situations this would be for macabre and somber children. In summary, although I'm certainly impressed by my sampling of earlier Kate, I alsoliked this Kate. I hope she continues to produce music, either similar to this or not.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is a great movie, funny, funny, funny!!  Great characters, just sit back and enjoy and laugh a lot!!  I have watched this movie 4 times already!

B006JTS5OO|1.0|So, two stupid humans and one stupid muppet doing stupid things.  This movie is boring even for my 8 years-old nephew.  I mean, who's the target of this movie? Old people who saw the original Muppet's Show 30 years ago or young people who prefer non-puppetish movies?  I liked the Muppet's Show when I was a kid.. but.. Disney turned the Muppets franchise into a musical-stupidity-musical-stupidity endless cycle.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I was surprised but this game is fun and addictive. and you can't beat the current price! works great on HTC thunderbolt
B000ZBPQEO|5.0|First of all, the quantity and general quality of these discs make it an incredible value, worth much more than the current asking price of less than $2 per disc.  You should order it before it goes out of print.  EMI has done better than I would have expected of them for the sound quality of some of the very oldest recordings, and I do not think that you will be disappointed as long as you do not have unreasonable expectations regarding what can be done with the ones recorded in the 1940's.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find them listenable.<br /><br />However, it is not complete.  For example, EMI has released a set of CDs entitled \\"L'art de Herbert von Karajan\\" in which there is a recording of Maurice Ravel's Boléro recorded \\"Berlin, Philharmonie, 5-7.I.1977\\" (they use the French spelling in that release), which is not in this set.  It is also on this EMI disc [[ASIN:B00000DOGW Debussy / La Mer, Prelude A L'Apres-MIDI /Ravel, Bolero]].  There is an earlier recording of that work, with a different orchestra in the \\"Complete [sic] EMI Recordings,\\" but it should contain both, and would contain both, if it were truly complete.  Given the general sloppiness of this release, I would not be surprised if there are other omissions as well.  Still, you are getting a tremendous amount of great music at an incredible bargain price, so I recommend this set highly.<br /><br />Additionally, the booklet and printing on the actual discs is terrible, with both omissions and errors.  You cannot completely trust the claim of either \\"stereo\\" or \\"mono\\" that is printed in fine print on the actual discs, though usually they are right, and when they are wrong, it is usually that they are claiming that a stereo recording is mono, though sometimes they claim a mono recording is stereo.  As others have noted, the booklet omits any listing for the beginning of disc 47, though you can look on the sleeve for the disc to find the name of the pieces on it.  And also as others have noted,there is no index, so finding what you want to hear is difficult.  There are also various typographical errors in the text.  All in all, a booklet that is worse than one generally finds in off brands.  EMI should be ashamed of the booklet, and they ought to offer from their web site a corrected version in pdf or a printed one for sale at cost, as the booklet is amazingly poor.  Still, the set is a great deal, so you should buy it despite the terrible booklet.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />5 stars for overall quality (though not all of the recordings deserve 5 stars, enough do to justify the overall rating of 5 stars)<br />5 stars for value (at the current price of less than $2 per disc)<br />1 star for documentation<br /><br />It is really unfortunate that EMI did not take greater care with this set and the documentation.  I would have been much happier paying an extra $20 for the set if they had fixed the problems before putting this out.  Still, I am extremely happy to have the set, and recommend it to everyone who likes classical music.  Here you get many great performances at a bargain price, along with many good performances.<br /><br />The only set I know of that gives it competition for real value is the companion set to this one, that features the vocal works.  You should buy that one, too, before you can no longer get it.  And it, too, shares many of the same virtues and vices.  And I am aware of and own some other bargain box sets, like the original Brilliant Classics releases of the complete Mozart and Bach, both of which are a great value, but much less consistently good for the quality of the performances.  With Herbert von Karajan, there is never anything that sounds like it is incompetently performed, and many of the performances are \\"first choice\\" quality, though not all of them are that good.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|Hi, for some reason it keeps cycling to the title screen every 5 sec (see developers symbol, opens to game, without touching anything then cycles back to develops symbol...).  i uninstalled the virus protector and cannot tell if it is the phone (back to verizon), a setting, or just the application.  very frustrating for all the money for the phone.  i just want it to work...  update:  pro: developer told me how to many fix the issues. thanks for trying to help.  con: it didn't work... it looks like some other \\"new\\" phones are having issues... important to address this... esp. if expect people to pay for this.
0385040253|5.0|The encyclopaedia of knots. How to tie them, how to recognise them and how to use them. How over 90 different occupations use them, and call them. Knots for nurses (spread-eagling the delirious to avoid injury or exhaustion), knots for poachers, hangmen, stevedores, skaters and surgeons. Decorative and trick knots. It boasts every practical knot, with 7,000 drawings representing over 3,900 knots. This latest edition even has the Hunter's Bend, a new knot added in 1979, and correctly identifies the two parallel inventors of the 1950s: an American climber and a British Physician, and gives both methods of tying it. (The only acid test I know). I cannot fault the book's range or treatment of the intricate (sorry) subject.  Something to delight the expert, the amateur, and the complete novice, with drawings that even quite young children can follow: hours of innocent fun on a wet weekend day: this book and some rope or string.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I am an avid Box user (been using it since it was box.net) and didn't even realize there was an Android app until today.  Just put it on my Fire and it works great.  I would say even easier than the Box website itself.  Two points I want to make - 1) It is much easier if you use a file browsing utility as a companion to this.  I suggest ES File Explorer. 2) You can use it as a cloud player.  Just upload your movies, music, docs, etc.  Hmmm. . . you might even use it for a simple way to not have to pay for Amazon Cloud. . . .
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|No doubt about it -- this was the sleeper of the year.  We LOVED this movie.  IF you're a Depp fan - a true Depp fan - and own all of his movies as we do, you'll keep this one on the top of the pile.
1594203334|1.0|I find it really funny that so many of you are taking advice from someone who wrote an article in Marie Claire about how she gave her husband a threesome for his 40th birthday.  This is also the same person who wrote a book on Infidelity. What?  You didn't know about any of this?  That's because any and all traces of her past works have been removed from her website because she was worried they would affect sales of this book (which is now the only book listed on Ms Druckerman's site). She also asked Marie Claire to take her article down.<br /><br />Also, as someone who has lived in France since 2003, I can tell you that the book is a whole lot of hogwash. The only reason her kids eat broccoli and Camembert is because of the French school system, where kids learn to eat a starter, main dish, cheese course & dessert from pre-school onwards.  And the part about how all French parents explain things very calmly and gently to their kids is completely ridiculous.  Having worked in the French school system, I can assure you that main way adults get kids to behave is by yelling at them, shaming them and belittling them into compliance.  I love France, but it is not a country that teaches its children to \\"be aware of those around them\\", it is a country that teaches its children to worry only about themselves and their inner circle.  Anyone who has been to France has seen evidence of this - it explains why people stop cold at the top of an escalator with no regard to others trying to get off or why the customer service is mostly awful (why should they be nice to someone they will likely never see again?).<br /><br />Ms Druckerman is writing about a very small section of upper-class Parisians whose children are raised by nannies, not your average French parent.  She is merely taking advantage of the fact that so many parents will gobble up any book that claims to have the secret to easy parenting.

0393061310|3.0|I borrowed this book from the Kindle Owner's Lending Library (KOLL). Many others have described the plot and Diamond's arguments, so I'll just state what I liked/didn't like about the book. First, this book is well-written and mostly well-argued. I appreciate the time Diamond took to fully research his topic. However, he doesn't cite any of his sources. I would have preferred to have the sources available in a references section at the end of the book.<br /><br />It took me several months to finish this book. Although the subject material is interesting, and the writing is good, this book is in no way riveting. I definitely never felt that I couldn't put it down. In fact, at times I had to force myself to go on.<br /><br />The kindle version is well-edited in that there aren't errors or scanning issues. But the tables (the few that are included) are terribly formatted and are painful to look at. I ended up skipping over them, mostly. There are no pictures or any of the other images in the paper book included in the kindle version. I'm not complaining about that, and it certainly doesn't impact my star rating, considering I borrowed the book for free from the KOLL, but it's useful information for you, should you choose to buy it from the kindle store.<br /><br />Overall, good book - I think it was educational and well-argued. However, it was also a little boring in parts.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Movie was great, but WB's decision to use Ultraviolet only with no option to get your digital copy in I-tunes forces me to give it only 1 star.  To emphasize, there is nothing wrong with the movie, it is a terrific movie, but I am rating the entire package here, so I give the film 10 stars, but the Ultraviolet Digital copy gets -9 stars leading to an overall one star rating.
B000001EUN|4.0|First of all, what is my mom doing on the album cover?  lol.  She resembles the girl in that picture a LOT!  Animal Magnetism is striking to me for the fact that for almost the entire time, the guitar riffs are *exceptionally* heavy and fierce.  This is actually one of the darkest albums the Scorpions ever made (well besides the obvious answer, Lonesome Crow).  The album is incredibly shy with the guitar solos which is another surprising element.  Animal Magnetism is all about dark, intimidating, plodding guitar riffs.  The vocal melodies are really catchy too.  \\"Make It Real\\" has a beautiful rhythm section.  The way it chugs along is enticing and actually, well, beautiful!  It sounds disco-like too.  Well wait a minute.  Let me correct myself so you don't think I'm referring to it as some kind of dated, sappy dance song.  No this is WAY too heavy for disco obviously, but the rhythm is reminiscent of the time period in which disco was around.  There.  That's my explanation.  Anyway, it's a bit strange to begin an album with a part-disco, part-ballad type of song, especially for a well-established heavy metal band, but I'm not complaining.  \\"Don't Make No Promise (Your Body Can't Keep)\\" is a clever song title since we know what the lyrics are pertaining to.  Short, fast-paced rocker and nothing more.  Doesn't *need* to be anything more either.  \\"Hold Me Tight\\" contains a simplistic verse melody but it's catchy and fitting, and the guitar riff is really wonderful as well.  \\"Twentieth Century Man\\" has a macho tough verse and quality vocals overall.  This actually reminds me of the Black Sabbath song \\"Country Girl\\" which I think came out AFTER this Scorpions album.  \\"Lady Starlight\\" is a 6-minute tender written ballad reminiscent of the Righteous Brothers classic \\"Unchained Melody\\".  At the end of each line I SWEAR Klaus is one second away from saying the words \\"and tiiiime can do so much!\\"  The guitar solo isn't really that memorable either because it's fairly standardand unimpressive.  It's predictable.  Not a bad song though but it takes away from the abnormal amount of aggression that takes up the rest of the material.  \\"Falling In Love\\" is VERY catchy in the verse melody and the chorus?  Well, it's only so-so.  \\"Only a Man\\" is the STRANGEST song the band ever made.  Alright maybe that's a stretch, but seriously, listen to the slightly offkey verse melody combined with a highly memorable chorus.  It's just very very different.  As a result of being weird, and since *I'm* weird... I love it!  \\"The Zoo\\" is a classic for a reason.  The plodding guitar riffs lead way to a spectacular metal song.  This song is like what would happen if Godzilla stomped across every city in America, but then again... that honor might go to the title song.  What better way to follow up a plodding display of guitar riffage with ANOTHER of the same exact thing, this time even *heavier?*  That's what the Scorpions have done here believe it or not, because THIS guitar riff is even more forceful and intimidating.  It makes me think I'm stuck in a dangerous situation and can't escape.  It's awesome.  The vocals are creepy (in a good way).  Excellent song.  Overall, alright, perhaps I WAS wrong to write off the Scorpions' early 80's material as just typical hair metal when in fact, this album and Blackout at least, are quite impressive and clearly very different from most metal.
B005XY67WI|2.0|I have always considerd Shakira one of the better bodies in the music world; however, she has lost some weight arround the hips.  This doesn't affect her singing voice; but, I had grown accustome to seeing those curves.  As for the conert she put on, it was nice.  The songs and back-up dancers where multi-curtural.  She started as an artist speaking Spanish and English; and she has gone back to her roots.  I'm not sure if a French word was given; but the music was good like always with Shakira.  She is a ture humanatorian and I like her.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app. works well, just as described. makes me waste plenty of time! addicted to solitaire ,I find myself playing it all the time.
0143118757|5.0|I ordered this as a gift.  And my friend really enjoyed reading it.  It was everything that a friend had mentioned book would have and very helpful information.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its fun and awesome its kinds hard thought but only some games are hard to me and my brother
B006IVBSBU|1.0|I should have followed my instincts on this one possibly being a total bomb. I wasted 5 bucks that I could of used for a better movie rental.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great game! Much higher quality than most of the other free apps they usually offer on here.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really fun game, but it doesn't read your mind and put the cards in the places they should go and you want them to go, so work on this. Other than having to manually move the cards sometimes,which adds extra moves to your score, it is a fast and fun game. Even for free! It is a great download for a Spider Solitaire game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have grown tired of sudoku, and this kindle game never fails to challenge me.  I have never played solitaire before, and was able to figure it out by reading the directions.  It never repeats itself.  I'm having some cognitive problems, so feel like this game for kindle is just what the doctor ordered.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Wow, this is kind of like terrestrial but WAY better! i highly recomend this game to people who like a challenge... the cereal... its... so... CUUUUTTTTTEEEE :3

B0063GORYU|5.0|A great twist to solitaire with strategy and fun.  And the price is the best part!  You can't help, but enjoy this game.
0316286850|5.0|I'm no professional, but from what I gather, my girlfriend was 100% satisfied with this book as it was so much more than what she expected. I would encourage you to buy
0375703764|3.0|Unlike most postmodernist literature, this book is only half crap.  The other half is a rather nice, thought-provoking novel made somewhat irritating by an excess of \\"style\\" in the text layout.  My recommendation is to read only the thread that follows the experiences of the Navidson family.  Ignore the secondary Johnny Truant thread, which is self-indulgent and narcissistic, as well as boring.  The Navidson story is interestingly open-ended, with many possible interpretations.  This is one I'd enjoy discussing in a book group - based on my conversation with the person who recommended this book to me, there is a lot of self revelation in how one interprets the space within the house and its interactions with the characters.  I, personally, wouldn't call it horror, but the person who loaned it to me told me it was \\"the scariest book I ever read.\\"  I suspect that whether one finds the book scary also reveals much about the reader and perhaps the developmental stage one was in when one first read it.  (Tolkien is like this - if you read it in your pre-teen or early teen years, it's the best thing ever written - if you read it as an adult, you wonder what all the fuss is about.)  A key factor is whether one assumes certain things - emptiness, darkness, cold - to be inherently malevolent.  Asking yourself not only what all those things mean within the context of the book, but also what your instinctive and reasoned reactions to them are, are among the things that make this book worth the effort to read.  Overall, I'm not sorry I read it, but if I re-read it, I'll follow my own advice and focus only on the primary story line.  Worth reading if you're willing to put up with the pretentious and annoying text layout and ignore the secondary story line.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Finally a game with a novel premise. Who would have thought my lame high school job being a bag boy would prepare me to arrange the finicky groceries in a bag. Easy to learn, and hard to master.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I'm so happy this was free its so cute.  I can't put it down. Love it. I know my daughter will too. I was getting frustrated about the puzzle levels but i finally got it.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I like this ap, but it keeps locking up on me. I can play through several levels, but when it locks up, it goes back to level one.
0786891416|5.0|Since I'm a Nathan Fillion fan, I had to have this book anyway, but now I'm so glad I got it.  While \\"Castle\\" is not quite the wonder that \\"Firefly\\" was, it's still full of the same mischievous fun and fast action.  So when I saw that \\"Richard Castle's\\" first novel about \\"Nikki Heat\\" (based on Detective Beckett of the show, played by Salma Hayek)was an actual paperback, I had to try it.  It's a standard police-procedural, and the main character \\"Rook\\" (the trademark humor -- Castle/Rook -- get it?) isn't quite as much fun as his \\"Castle\\" counterpart in the show, but of course, the idea is that \\"Castle\\" wrote the book in his spare time while following \\"Beckett\\" around like a puppy (or as she says, like \\"a nine-year-old on a sugar high\\".  The developers of this book have had fun.  There are serious cover blurbs from \\"Richard Castle's\\" buddies James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell, along with an author bio with a picture of Nathan looking good.  I especially enjoyed \\"Castle's\\" long acknowledgment page, thanking his mother and daughter as well as some professional colleagues, both actual and fictional.  And the \\"author interview\\" is priceless.  Any fan of \\"Castle\\" will get a kick out of this book.  (And I'm dying to know who the real author is, but of course we may never know.)
B0073LWEXK|4.0|love this game but fang seem to use the rope for the well in chap 5. looking forward to playing more games like this.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are cute but very simple.  The controls are poor, though.  Some games aren't really worth all the points you need in order to &quot;buy&quot; them.  A good simple way to play a variety of games.
B003Y5H574|3.0|The screenplay writers lost control of their story starting at the film's midpoint, and perhaps worse, they didnt realize that had happened.  Let it be said, I liked much of the film but geez, there's some major sappiness (think Brady Bunch style improbable resolution) at the end of the film, _along_ with some creepy stuff dealing with the teen characters. Indeed the humor involving  Moore's character or any of the teenagers falls flat.  Gosling does a surprisingly great job fleshing out what is essentially a stereotype of a gigolo.  And Steve Carrel is also good -- though he's already done this exact role 5 times before  The writers really needed to do one more re-write.
1591840562|4.0|This book leaps off to a poor start, recommending you immediately make what you are trying to sell, and get out there and sell it.  That advice goes against what other books say.  Might want to look at \\"Nail It, then Scale It\\" which seems more reasoned, and thoughtful.  I like Kawasaki personally, but don't think much of his advice.  The Rockland folks that sell this book are good and thoughtful, and do a good job of dealing with minor flubs: Keep doing business with them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are confusing at first because they don't tell you what to do until after you play it! Besides that the games are pretty fun!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like everything about this game! The aesthetics, the music, the unincluded back story. It's lovely and challenging. A great puzzle game that looks beautiful on Kindle Fire. Thanks Fallen Tree!!

B0040JHL7W|5.0|...or at least they seem to! They're exceptionally comfortable, and nice looking, but the biggest benefit is that they keep 'ya running.

0596009208|5.0|So I'm not going to get into a chapter by chapter review, there are plenty of others who have done so. What I will say is this: I consider myself an intermediate java programmer, and while this book covers many topics that I already know and understand, it also gets into topics that I had no prior knowledge in (such as serialization.) It also covers topics such as threading and networking quite well.<br /><br />As a college student who deals with textbooks on a constant basis, I have to say that I simply love the way the authors structured this book. If you have at least the basics of java programming down, you will fly through this material and gain a significant level of knowledge in the process.<br /><br />I'm not sure how absolute beginners would fair with this book, but as long as you keep Google handy to fill in any blanks, I imagine you'll do just fine.<br /><br />(And of course, it's probably wise to ignore the folks who have nothing but bad things to say about this book. Just keep in mind that their inability to learn the basics of programming likely has *nothing* to do with the quality of this text!)
0307949508|3.0|I just finished reading The Girl Who Played With Fire and I'm confused about the very beginning, the Prologue... the 13 year old girl who's tied up with a harness on a bed for 39 days and how she hates him, hates the smell of him... on and on for a few pages. (And, what a horrible thing). No names are given for the girl or her tormentor. I thought for sure this girl would be mentioned again in the book, come back around and tie up this terrible ordeal, but it was never mentioned again! Was it Salander when she was 13 or somebody else, like a victim of the sex trade that the book is based on? Drives me crazy to have plot twists, especially terrible ones like this, just dangling there and not completed! I wanted that girl to escape and do in her tormentor. But nothing ....<br /><br />Did I miss this plot twist in the story?? Who was it and what happened to her?<br /><br />As many people said previously in these reviews... this book could have done with a good editor. It sure had some clunky parts in the story and I started losing track of all the various male characters with their similar Swedish names. I needed a cheat sheet to remember them all!
1451627289|5.0|I really can't say more than what has already been said, so I'll keep it simple.  This book is amazing, will keep you reading well into the night, has some thrills, and plenty of heart.  If you have ever liked SK, you will like this book.  If you have never read SK, then this is a good one to start with.  This is one of those books that you hate to finish, but can't stop reading until it's over.  Bravo, Mr. King, Bravo.
0786958731|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I've played with large groups and by myself many times and the game runs smoothly in both cases, it is even really easy to teach people.  but, keep this in mind when you play, THIS IS NOT DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.  If you're expecting essentially D&D in board game format, it is not.  My only real gripe with this game is that victory is rather abrupt and never really feels like a win, more like you simply stopped playing.  I have found, though, that you can string a few quests together into one game and it becomes more entertaining, especially if you're familiar with the Drizzt story line.  Pieces are well constructed, instructions are very intuitive and comprehensive.  I suggest this game to anyone that wants an easily playable and wonderfully enjoyable game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an awesome movie for young and old alike.  Action, humor and very tender moments.  A great all around movie!!

B0020M99LC|5.0|I think Casino Royale was the best of them all.  Although it is hard to compare--this was made in a different time from the old ones.  The old ones were more friendly and had more of a warm, everything is okay feeling of fun.  But Casino Royale was gritty all the way through, and seriously dramatic and sad in the end.  There was never any real drama in any of the others.  If you pay attention, and watch it a couple times, at the end you can pick up the message the director and writers probably worked really hard to communicate: the movie showed how James Bond became what he was.  This movie covered the beginning of his career as a spy.  You notice at the beginning, the scene about him killing the first person whose life he'd ever taken--the guy he murdered in the men's room.  That means it was the beginning.  After what happened in the movie at the end you then see how he would not care about any of the women he was with after Vespar and would be able to kill people indiscriminately.  I don't want to spoil it if someone hasn't seen it, but his heart was dead after what happened and he went from then on as a very hard man, like untouchable, using women and killing people.  Outstanding action, great story and acting, and a theme communicated effectively that took some real talent in the movie makers to show.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game and app!  Have never had a single problem with it since downloading it.  Would definitely recommend this to everyone!!!
B000I3PERS|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and has been since I first saw it.  Just thinking about one scene or another reminds me of the poignancy of the whole thing.  I won't try to write all about it.  It might not be enjoyable to a lot of people, and I wouldn't exactly enjoy it if I watched it now (for about the 24th time or so), but it will probably be moving to most and deeply moving to some individuals such as myself.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|If you like \\"The phantom of the opera\\" this works,You must collects. One never get tired of musicals, is good!!!!
B001N4OX82|5.0|This was a good one.  The themes are consistent through the whole film, the script is entirely believable, the acting is outstanding, and the story is considered a classic by some-I'm kidding, it's Homer, and the adaptation to the screen is very well done.  It is a sad story though and Achilles was a son of a -----, so I could see how some might not enjoy it.  But it's all believable and entertaining.  And I want to BE Hector.  Well played.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I love this book. Its like Alice in Wonderland mashed with X men in the best ways. So entertaining I read it in three days. The author takes you with him on an adventure that is greatly enhanced by the addition of the photos. If you like adventures with peculiar twists you will love this book!

B003Y5H5HY|4.0|At the time of his death, Swedish author Stieg Larsson was sitting on a trilogy of unpublished novels called the \\"Millenium Series\\".  His life ended before he was able to see his trilogy about an unorthodox ward of the state surveillance agent named Lisbeth Salander, take off into an international sensation. His novels became best sellers, in 2009 the first of his trilogies was made into a Swedish film called \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and was consequently followed up with two more films, and now the movie has been adapted into an English language film, directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network).<br /><br />Salander, (Rooney Mara) otherwise, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, has led an abusive life and after her legal guardian suffers a stroke, she is legally assigned to a new guardian, who uses his position and her money as a tool to abuse her even more. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is hard hitting and offensive at times, but such is the beauty of Larsson's writings. We would all like to believe that violence and abuse doesn't exist, but the truth is we choose to ignore it, brush it under the rug and pretend it doesn't.  This is the very theme that resides throughout Larsson's \\"Millenium Series\\" and throughout \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".<br /><br />The majority of the movie centers on a 40-year old murder mystery and a fourteen-year old girl who vanished from a prominent family without explanation. Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a magazine publisher, is hired to investigate the crime. Through a course of events, he and Salander become partners into a rich and complicated mystery.<br />As someone who has seen all of the Swedish films and can give an opinion about the English language version, based on the original, David Fincher has added much to the film. The movie appears to be more in depth and shows more of Lisbeth's character changing throughout. Her harshness softness as the movie goes along and Fincher has chosen to emphasis that more. The movie can feel wordy and long, but during that time, the information and investigation is thoroughly interesting and challenging.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a breakout film for Rooney Mara, just as it was for Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes 2), who played the title character in the original release. She fought hard for the part and she does it justice. She wears the scars of a troubled past like a glove and is able to shed those things when it is necessary.<br /><br />I can't say that the new version is better than the original or worse. The truth is, they are both great films because of the subject matter, the richness of the characters and the writing. The new film will certainly bring a larger audience to an already popular series of movies worldwide. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" will most certainly be one that will be mentioned on Oscar night, if only for just Rooney Mara.movie can feel wordy and long, but during that time, the information and investigation is thoroughly interesting and challenging.  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a breakout film for Rooney Mara, just as it was for Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes 2), who played the title character in the original release.

B005LAIGTG|4.0|Surprisingly enough, there is much to be said about \\"The Vow\\", the latest movie from writer Abby Kohn (Valentines Day & Never Been Kissed) and it isn't bad. Is the screenplay outstanding? No. It isn't. In fact, it's pretty typical romantic movie fair. Despite the fact that the movie starts and ends with a note that says it is based on actual events and shows a picture of the couple that inspired the movie, the movie could have very easily fallen into soap opera lala-land. It doesn't though, for many reasons.<br /><br />First off, a quick explanation of the film and why it could have been, but wasn't, silly. The movie starts off with Leo, played by Channing Tatum (Dear John, Step Up) and Paige, played by Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Morning Glory), leaving a movie theatre, smiling and enjoying a beautiful snowy night and they are obviously very much in love. Little do they know, they are about to walk into a situation that will change their lives forever. Moments later, they are both wheeled into an emergency room and Leo's injuries are far less severe than Paige's. When Paige recovers or awakes, days later, she has no memory of Leo or the fact that they are married and truly in love. This is where it could have been very soap opera, but instead, the movie is very real. We experience the dilemmas that both characters are facing and the director and writer handle it capably.<br /><br />What truly makes \\"The Vow\\" a movie that will stand the test of time though, is the chemistry between McAdams and Tatum. The two of them are fantastic at portraying the unique bond that they have. Their relationship is truly unique and as the movie flashes back to their life and shows how they met, how they courted, how they got married and you know that they belong together. This isn't scripting. This is acting, because as the coin flips, both actors take that very same love they feel for each other and become strangers with different personalities.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the movie could have been written any differently, but the story is a little bit clich&eacute;' and done before, but hasn't it all by now. What truly makes \\"The Vow\\" a standout film is the performances by Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. They prove that they are both stars to be recognized with in Hollywood and that they both know how to take an audience and shape them like putty in their hands. I think McAdams was always good at that and Tatum is getting better.differently, but the story is a little bit cliché' and done before, but hasn't it all by now.

This cd has songs that are so catchy you will have a copy in your car,ipod,and home! Tracks to listen to: WONDERLAND,ZOMBIE,BREAK YOU HARD,LOVE IS A SUICIDE,AND SUPERFICIAL. I rate this album 5 stars,its a must have!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Mission Impossible may just be one of the most satisfying television show to movie adaptations of all time. There have been four movies in the series and the third installment took the series to a whole new level. The newest installment, \\"Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol\\" has created a new level on top of that. With complex storylines that intertwine, realistic and jaw dropping action scenes, nicely placed humor and the ability to let the audience play along, MIP 4 may just be the perfect spy movie.<br /><br />When the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shutdown after being blamed for a bombing at the Kremlin, four agents are forced to work without help in order to clear their name and stop a world-changing catastrophe. Sounds like a tense storyline doesn't it? Well, it is. Every second counts and the movie makes you feel those seconds counting by at every moment and during every task at hand. Everything is nip and tuck and the movie feels that way due to the tight writing and seamless editing.<br /><br />Some of the most awe-inspiring stunts I've ever witnessed are in MIP4. They are so well done and so beautifully shot that there is no suspension of belief to be had. In fact, I'm pretty sure that was Tom Cruise swinging back and forth outside the Burj Khalifa tower, which is the tallest building in the world. The reason why is because it was Tom Cruise doing his own stunts. The actions scenes are real and filmed in a way that isn't hokey and impossible to follow. The car chases are intense. The fights are physical and real looking and don't have shaking cameras to disguise the lack of realism. The action scenes aren't over the top like most block buster movies these days try to pass off in order to please the ticket buyers.<br /><br />\\"MIP4: Ghost Protocol\\" is an exciting and creative movie for anyone who loves espionage type films. The disguises, the technology, the backstabbing, the people in powerful places and the high intensity are all in place. The Mission Impossible series appears to be getting better, which is a rarity with most sequels.be getting better, which is a rarity with most sequels.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|Leo as J. Edgar Hoover is not unlike a butt pimple attempting to portray Mount Everest! He is even less effective as Hoover than he was as Howard Hughes in \\"Aviator.\\"  I just do not understand how this little wimp keeps getting cast in the roles of epic characters. I suppose this absurdity stems from Hollywood's belief that all modern films must be targeted to teenage hormones! The same reason a ditz like Madonna winds up playing (trying to play) Eva Peron I suppose.  Again, Eastwood distorts history to accomodate his own biases.  In short: bad acting, bad history, bad movie!  dj
B005LAIGP0|4.0|In \\"The Woman in Black\\" Daniel Radcliffe, otherwise immortalized as Harry Potter, plays Arthur Kipps, a struggling lawyer, on his last ditch assignment from his law firm to settle the estate of a friendless old widow. He leaves his 4-year old son behind for four days to travel to a remote village called Crythin Gifford, UK. Once there, he finds himself unknowingly walking into a legend and a legacy of tragedy and unexplained events that have had a stranglehold on the village for decades.<br /><br />The first thing to be said about \\"The Woman in Black\\" and its star, Daniel Radcliffe, is that this was a brilliant move by him as an actor to do something so quickly after the Harry Potter series came to a close, and something so different as well. Never once while watching this movie did I think about Harry Potter. Radcliffe may be one of the few actors who has become so well known for one character that will be able to make the transition into other things.<br /><br />\\"The Woman in Black\\" is a remake of a successful television movie that came out in 1989. It is a ghost story, pure and simple, although, it is not simply described as a ghost story, because there is so much more to it than that. It isn't for the viewer looking for gratuitous violence. Maybe its greatest asset as a movie is its ability to turn ghost story in to mystery, slowly walking you through a haunting situation and revealing the secrets behind the strange happenings a little as a time, just as Arthur Kipps is discovering them.<br /><br />The villagers are opposed to Arthur Kipps visiting the mysterious house across the vast marshlands and Kipps soon finds out why. He is quickly greeted to a mystery and a story that holds the audience in place and never lets up. The movie is never slow and always interesting. Yet at times, some of the things that move the story along can be considered a little hokey, but that placed aside, the mood and delivery are effective.<br /><br />\\"The Woman in Black\\" is a campfire tale and a campfire tale at its finest. It is a successful leap for Radcliffe who is trying to separate himself from being Harry Potter, and it is certainly a movie that will keep your eyes wide open because the things that haunt the mysterious house are not shy.t.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|\\"The Grey\\" is the latest film from writer/director Joe Carnahan, who's previous outings all had a dark and moody feel to them, although this movie is a definitely a different turn for him. Most of his movies are set in urban environments, like \\"Narc\\", \\"Smokin' Aces\\" and \\"Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane\\" and \\"The Grey\\" is far far far from anything urban.<br /><br />The movie is about an Alaskan oil drilling team that is on their way to a big job when their plane drops out of the sky and in the middle of a snowy tundra and there are only seven survivors. They are held prisoner by the elements and are forced to adapt to the very assurance that they will most likely die. They are led by a team sniper named Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, who is along for the trip because of his ability to shoot wolves and protect the workers. This is a skill that certainly comes in handy as they are greeted by a pack of wolves on night one.<br /><br />On top of dealing with bitter cold, wounds from the plane crash and knowing that they won't be found anytime soon, the wolves that don't eat but kill become an overwhelming obstacle. \\"The Grey\\" has a very dark overtone, as probably goes without saying. It is definitely a testosterone movie, filled with men being men and men figuring out ways to survive as long as they can.<br /><br />I would be amiss if I stated that the movie didn't hold my attention throughout, but there is much about \\"The Grey\\" that left me with a disappointing taste in my mouth. First of all, the movie plays out like a horror movie with its predictable one at a time story layout. There have been many movies similar to this in the past, like \\"Alive\\" and \\"The Edge\\" where a man had to survive a grizzly bear, and \\"The Edge\\" managed to hold you on the edge of your seat throughout. It was unpredictable and frightening. \\"The Grey\\" is very predictable and once you see the pattern, you know it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The movie leaves you with a empty feeling as it explores life, religion, hope and death throughout. You get to know the men who are facing impossible odds and you root for them till the end. Yet, \\"The Grey\\" is what it is, a dark, moody, dreary story about living and dieing.ghout.

B005LAIGN2|3.0|George Lucas has overseen the creation and American phenomenon's of six \\"Star Wars\\" movies and four \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies, including producing many other smash hit movies, and with his latest Lucas studios release, he says that he's done everything he ever dreamed of doing. That latest release is a biopic about a crew of Negro pilots in the Tuskegee training program, otherwise known as the Red Tails. Not unlike the things that the Tuskegee airmen had to face, on top of facing Nazi's during World War 2, George Lucas faced much alienation with this project from studio executives across Hollywood. Despite his credentials and his long time devotion to the project, Lucas couldn't get a `yes' from a single one of them.<br /><br />Well, \\"Red Tails\\" may just be one of Lucas' best movies in years, although that isn't saying much. The Tuskegee airmen were delegated to, as one airmen stated in the film, \\"shooting traffic\\"; trains and trucks. Not only were they wrongfully characterized as unintelligent and not brave enough, but they also were facing a public relations machine in a military that didn't want negro airmen getting credit for battles in the newspapers. Thus, they were given unimportant missions.<br /><br />\\"Red Tails\\" is a good return for George Lucas, but also for Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and then went into B-movie oblivion. Terrence Howard has been on a similar road since \\"Ray\\" and \\"Hustle and Flow\\", although he's bounced back and forth with an occasional hit.  The real stars of the movie are Nate Parker, who plays Captain Marty \\"Easy\\" Julian and David Oyelowo who plays Joe \\"Lightning\\" Little. The two of them are best friends and give character and soul to a film and a story that needed a face.<br /><br />George Lucas is no stranger to filming and creating aerial battles. We've seen them dozens of times in his Star Wars movies and his expertise shows in this movie, they are just a little closer to earth. The battle scenes in \\"Red Tails\\" are real and engaging. Although some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.<br />The biggest problem with \\"Red Tails\\" has nothing to do with the characters, the story that needs to be told and the battles that were fought and ignored, but the fact that the movie could have told so much more of a story and didn't. Truth be told, the story of the Tuskegee airmen is history that we didn't learn. It is a story that needs to be seen and heard by everyone, but the movie doesn't give it justice. The movie plays like a footnote only to inform us of their existence, but never gets beyond the surface to inform us of anything more.<br /><br />\\"Red Tails\\" could have been so much more, but I still recommend the film, just for the sheer sake that this is a story that isn't taught in our schools and should be.hough some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.

0385535139|4.0|Finley and Figg is a two-man law firm that usually makes its money by ambulance chasing, car accidents, hospital visits, quickie divorces, and DUIs.  Trying to gain notoriety and millions of dollars, they chase after a large class action tort claim against a cholesterol drug, Krayoxx, that allegedly causes deadly side effects.  Allegedly, as in `innocent until proved guilty.'  To add to the humorous, bickering couple of Finley & Figg and their office assistant, Rochelle, a young 32-year-old lawyer, David Zinc, burns out in his high-paying law firm position and literally tumbles into their office drunk after drinking all day at a local bar. He bumblingly enters into their frays.  The Litigators by John Grisham is about the legal wranglings, manipulations, stipulations, and courtroom shenanigans of lawyers which sound so absurd that one can hardly believe they happen today, yet they actually do.  The little three-man office against the giant pharmaceutical company, Varrick Labs, and their hoards of attorneys-all from David Zinc's former office.  This seemed to be one of the most trivial, slow moving books I think I've ever read before some real action began.  Kind of like the everyday grind in a law office at times.  I had to force myself to keep reading, but I've experienced John Grisham's writings before, and I knew the action would materialize. And did it ever pay off!  The slower pace and what seemed like boring details were necessary to build up to the climax.  I'm just used to high-rev action from page one.  It was worth the time to read!  Grisham has you rooting for the little guy, though all the while everything seems hopeless.  The plot builds, while you hold your breath as to the outcome.  He reels you in page by page and you know you're hooked, because you can't put the book down!  I don't appreciate the cursing, which Grisham has been adding to his novels as of late, but the additional side plots added some intrigue to the main story line.  I borrowed thisbook from my local library.  These are my honest opinions.

B004GHYCKW|5.0|Fantastic cd by P.J. Harvey.  So well produced and with incredible songs--this one cd has really revived for her a kind of lost \\"dada\\" musical approach that, I guess, spent its course.  Thank God.  Such a talented artist as Harvey and it's all wildly and wonderfully displayed on this cd.  The social reform element is genuine and poignant and the arrangements are superb.  To me, one of the great cd's of the last five years.  The closest I can relate this quality of music is with Mano Chao.  Vocals are superb and a plus is the quality of the material.  Yes, England should slide: it's a decadent country with a decaying, cynical and useless royalty and a stratified class structure--Harvey examines this setting with both detest and sympathy and outright unabashed love for her country.  Wow!  What a fine performance.

1451627289|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had never read a novel by Stephen King before, but this is a great place to start. When I read, I need to get sucked in by the story, the characters, or some other basic aspect of the book. The premise of this book was intriguing to me and King makes a very unusual plot line work. I loved this book, and, like any good book, I was a bit sad when it was over. Very, very good.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic thrill ride through Hugh Howey's twisted imagination. I refuse to classify this into any particular genre as it blends several so well it would be rude to even attempt it. WOOL has everything. Characters I feel like I know so well I wonder why they're not in my phone's contacts. A setting I could make my way through in the dark and a plot that is carefully planned and executed. The story here is tight, well-written, descriptive and impossible to put down.<br /><br />Not very often does a story enthrall me to the degree that WOOL has done but a person would be a fool to miss these!<br /><br />A damn fool.

B004FE20RS|5.0|Anyone reading the first review on this episode would get a very bad impression of this series.  I may be biased by the developments that happened in the second season, but I really appreciate the pace at which this is moving.  They started us right off with the action, and we will learn more about the characters first.  It makes sense that some of the characters die before we really get to know them... What else would be more realistic in a post-apocalyptic world with all kinds of dangers around.  We will get to know these characters through the memories and flashbacks or even just references from other characters.  If you want realism, accept that group members are dying, and expect that some of the main characters are going to die, as well.  Look at the Season 1 Non-HD version of this on Amazon for proper reviews by hundreds of people.
0062060562|4.0|The reader quickly starts to understand and appreciate Christine's emotions.  She wakes up each morning in a strange room alongside a man she does not recognise, and suffers the shock of looking in the mirror and seeing a woman aged 20 years older than herself looking back at her.  The bewilderment and fear is apparent and very well portrayed.<br /><br />Although this is well written, at the halfway stage I felt the book was harrowing, but I was not really enjoying it.  However, then things really start to get interesting as Christine's sense of self awareness increases page by page and one gets the sense that all is not quite right.<br /><br />This is an unusual plot, but the medical condition is real enough although very rare.  The only other time I recall seeing it portrayed was in [[ASIN:B0001Z3TXE 50 First Dates (Widescreen Special Edition)]].  However, that is a comedy very far removed from the tone of this book.  I think Christine's confused reactions each morning are very realistic and are about a million miles from Drew Barrymore's who watches a quick video and then goes out to meet her family, who she does not know, with a smile on her face each day.<br /><br />So to summarise, this is a very promising first novel and extremely well crafted book with a very unusual plot.

They comfortably peek into your ear without being wedged in, and the headband keeps them on if you are running on a treadmill.<br /><br />As far as quality goes, at this price, I am totally OK with the fact that they usually break after a year or so, losing sound in one of the two ears eventually if you use them actively.<br /><br />So, if you are looking at this picture and think to yourself, I like that kind of headphone, and/or you are thinking to yourself, I have less than $10 to spend, then go ahead and order them! If you have Amazon Prime, all the better because FREE shipping makes these a steal.

1401937519|5.0|I cannot possibly recommend this book enough.  I \\"accidentally\\" came across an interview with Anita on Youtube last fall.  The beauty and genuineness of her soul shone through and her story was fantastic, mesmerizing, and made you feel lighter with hope and joy.  I have been eagerly anticipating her book since then, frequently checking back and literally dropped everything to get the book when I saw it was out.  And... that still wasn't soon enough!  It's the type of book you'll get through in 24 hours and want to share with everyone you know after that.  Anita doesn't claim to have your answers, but her story builds the faith that all your answers are within... live without fear, be authentic to yourself, and we are all one (hence, there is no judgement).  I have been traveling down a path, trying to balance what I spiritually and internally believe, with what others try to convince me is the path to \\"salvation\\" and this book has finally sealed the deal that I no longer have to look for the answers out there.  I have freed myself to experience what truth feels like to me, and I am doing so without any fear.  So often, books about God being within every one of us resonate so well with me, but I find myself hesitant of going down the \\"wrong\\" path, and I don't fully embrace this beautiful truth.  Dying to be Me, came at just the right time for me, following after some other great books including \\"Manifesting Change\\" by Mike Dooley (different theme, but wonderfully beneficial... I just reviewed his book too!  ([[ASIN:B004WB19QC Manifesting Change: It Couldn't Be Easier]]).  Dying to be Me is easy to read, yet loaded with life changing depth and meaning.<br /><br />Thank you Anita for writing this book and for having the experience you did.  Thank you for coming back to tell us.  This book is all about hope, it is for everyone, whatever point they may be on their spiritual path, whatever phase of life they are in.  I wanted a friend who was dying of cancer to hear thismessage last fall, but her ears and heart were closed and she passed quickly.  That being said, I know she passed on to glorious happiness where she once again became aware of the true amazingness of who she really is.  Anita too wanted to go on to \\"death\\", it was beautiful and filled with unconditional love, but she chose to come back to this realm to give ALL OF US a message.  Some of our friends and loved ones will still die of sickness, maybe even after reading this book, but don't resent them their passing.  I would think for most, the bliss of all perfection is a far greater pull than what they have just left behind.  However... anyone who can, please hear the message that if we live fearlessly, give the world all of our true selves, and hold no judgements against anyone, then we can have our bliss here on earth too.<br /><br />P.S.  Thank you too, Mr. Wayne Dyer... you are truly a remarkable spirit.  I had the pleasure of listening to Imaculee Ilibagiza speak, also last fall, and she too, just like Anita, shared her story of amazing coincidence on how you were influential on getting her book published by being \\"magically\\" in the right place at the right time.  Your spirit is truly amazing as you allow the universe to bring amazing people to you, and the amazing you, to people.  Thank you... you were probably my first introduction, through PBS, to the power of who we are, and you are living proof!

I espesially love the music! But its hard, so if you like hard games that are sprited and drawn, and love princesses and golems and fighting and great music, then you have to get this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! Many nights spent playing solitaire listening to Pandora! Such a fun way to pass time. Yeah.
0307888908|5.0|Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha have produced the definitive manual for connecting and career-building in our entrepreneurially-driven economy. The last ten years of changes in communication technology and corporate employment have changed the rules for career success. No one has captured this change and covered the new rules better than Hoffman and Casnocha. Practical suggestions and an entertaining style make it a great read.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy movies from the last 2 decades.  It brought back memories of my childhood and laughing until my stomach hurt at the brownies in this.  Now my 9 yo can enjoy it too.  He watched it 3x in one weekend!  Love it!  Easy ordering and delivery and it only cost me $5.99 - GREAT deal.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|I can't understand how people could rate one of the best albums in classic rock history anything lower than a 5-star. As a teen, I used to sneak my dad's vinyl album version (until eventually I bought my own), and as an adult I've purchased both CD and MP3 of this album. I don't mind that it isn't re-mastered; when you're dealing with a classic, it doesn't need to be changed.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I think the best games for android are usually physics based. flinging birds, you making bridges, riding a motorcycle or a cart, all of them can be challenging and entertainment but all of them are the same exact game with a different variables. this game Bag It, is definitely challenging like tetris, the manages to be very fun and entertaining. as far is casual games go this one is up there with the best of them. on top of all sleeping very funny, there are weird challenges and different types of games. save the eggs, crash the melons, stack the bread, it's all good and fun. I would like to think the developers hidden variable studios for bringing such a quality games to the amazon market for free.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I am almost 54 and I still love this movie!! I love the music, its just an overall a good movie!!! My grandchildren loves this movie so that is the reason I bought this for them. Well for me also!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like having several games to play.  There are a couple I have trouble with because my finger hides part of screen making it difficult to play but otherwise I enjoy this app.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|It would be better  if the hint screen stayed where you last checked Instead of automatically reverting to the top of chapter one. Great game andrecommend to every one. Much more interaction.8
B00004T9VY|5.0|I havent listened to this in probably 35 years,I cant remember what happened to my vinyl,guess we will never know,who cares,the CD is better.Cat is like the Eagles,Doobies and Bee Gees,timeless.Do yourself a favor,buy it!!
B005HSL626|1.0|the game would not allow me to begin at times.  it would lag quite often and sometimes would black out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games I really enjoy being able to unlock the.new games. it keeps it very interesting and.keeps me coming.back for more
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I was hesitant at first, but once you get past the first few levels, it gets much better. Levels are interesting and progressively harder.
0143117009|5.0|This book is a great reader, explaining many ways in how societies fail. Chapter 14 is my favorite, I actually am writing a paper about this book in my english class and it works great...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are cool. I didn't expect to have to pay though. that is pretty lame. I barely play because it takes so long to get enough points to bug another game.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|really I can't believe amazon. while I don't condone alternative lifestyles I hoped this kind of hate and bigotry would never penetrate the amazon market. use of such hate-filled words complete with an icon that clearly promotes hate against love, especially today is mind boggling. STOP THE HATE.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! its very fun,challenging , and addictive. I would reccomend it to anybody that wants an aawesome fun game to play!
0553582038|3.0|The author said he'd rather tell the whole story for half the characters than half the story for all the characters...  Well, nice idea on paper...but in practice it turn out to be an extremely boring idea...You end up with page after page, chapter after chapter of the same 5 or 6 characters...it gets really boring after a while...to the point where I was actively wishing for characters to just die already!  I'm dreading the next book. As I think it will be much of the same.  What makes large fantasy series fun is experiencing events through the eyes of multiple characters, almost simultaneously. This book does not do that.
0143113100|3.0|The author seems to hold some brain plasticity experts with a higher regard than others. He hounded the founder of fast forword as if the author was some teenager with a crush. Fast Forward is portrayed as more amazing than other program and this did not seem objective or fair.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This item is very durable, stylish, and easy to use. So I have absolutely no complaints and would gladly recomend this to someone who owns a Plat Station 3 or compatable gaming console.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|the app occasionally asks to be read, so. I suggest if u buy this app prepare to have ur life written for u. take some consideration before buying this app. have to be willing to do dedicate personal time for it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very customizable. Works well. Even has an option to deal a winning hand which I haven't used yet but can imagine might be nice on a rough day :)
B004IZMQI2|1.0|I tried to like this book. It was recommended by a couple of people I really respect, but I hated it. I thought the writing was horrible and to me everything could have been said in a couple of pages instead of dragging it into a \\"book\\".  As someone with a love for art and a dozen projects constantly in the works, I constantly struggle with resistance and often lose. Though I can honestly say I feel no more motivated or empowered to overcome resistance than if the author had simply said, \\"Just get off your butt and do it.\\" Because basically that is the answer.  To each his own, but this book was a waste of time and money for me.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|hard to rate since I can not get it to open.  for all I know it is good. HTC incredible2
B006PHD0RW|5.0|use it on kindle fire. worth it. esp.on free day. its time consuming, challenging, colorful and fun i think. thought its be silly and easy but its not. try it!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I have always loved this movie even though I'm not much of a fan of Alec Baldwin, even I think this movie is one everyone will love. It is a classic. The cast is hilarous! I love the scene when they are all dancing at the table and the shrimp come out and attack them. Yes this is a movie that I highly recommend buying. :)
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Game is fun and addicting. Learning curve isn't very steep and it's easy to figure out how to play for the high score.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game doesn't have the greatest graphics but the games are addicting I'm not really sure if it really has 101 games though......
B006PHD0RW|3.0|not a bad game but the touch screen function needs a ton of work. HTC thunderbolt is like pulling teeth trying to move and rotate objects
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is epic and fun.the one stars have no sense of fun.love this game so fun have problems sleeping cause its so fun
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Its so funny seeing people get so worked up over superman75...he's just making jokes, and a 1 star review will not affect 100 5 star ones. Lighten up guys! Anyways, its an OK app, but its bagging fake groceries...and you don't even get paid - I mean, how boring is that??!! Oh well, the virtual food app was more sad than this...
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good App, easy to use and works as it should. If you like Spider Solitare this is the app for you.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Every song on the album displays the immense talent of each of the members; Wolfgang is worthy to replace Michael Anthony and Eddie gets better by the minute! Alex's drumming hasn't changed much, but it's still phenomenal. Roth's vocals are great as well; he even throws out those trademark screeches we remember so well from Van Halen I-1984. The lyrics are great, and the riffs are outstanding! I have the album repeating nonstop and every time it comes back around, something new is discovered; fell in love with it after the first few tracks. I recommend Big River, Blood and Fire, You and Your Blues, and She's The Woman! =VH=
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the 15 day forecast. changes a lot thought so don't get your hopes up. and always over estimates precipitation and snowfall totals. has been force closing every 15-30 seconds when I open it on my fire. needs an update soon.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I'm going to start this off saying I have been a huge Van Halen fan for many years.  I am also a huge Van Hagar/Chickenfoot/Satriani fan.  If you like either of these groups there is a simple single thing to say.  THANK YOU!  Its been so many years...  For the first time we have new Chickenfoot and New Van Halen within months!  Now \\"A DIfferent Kind of Truth\\"  I was skeptical about how the album would sound without Michael.  My initial impressions were that the backround vocals sounded a bit flat compared with older Van Halen records.  After I got over the change in vocal tone I started listening more to the guitar.  Eddie's guitar really stands out on this album compared with the Van Hagar albums.  After seeing the Van Hagar concert in 2004,  my confidence in EVH had been shaken.  However, the guitar parts on this album are incredible and unmistakably Eddie Van Halen.  This album does not feel like the follow up to 1984 but rather a follow up to Fair Warning.  This is due to a few things.  The album has a darker sound and tone than 1984 and even Diver Down..  Eddie has (happily) brought back the brown sound on his guitar in a big way.  His guitar's tone is beautiful and up front and center.  If you're a 1984 fan and didn't like Fair Warning or Diver Down then the sound of this album may not be for you.  However, the day Tatoo came out I heard it early in the morning (6:30am) off youtube.  I couldn't help but turn it up and with that came my wife's loud voice reminding me that it was very early.  It was like a trip back in time, Van Halen, getting yelled at for music being to loud!  Good feelings all around are my comments on this album.  Know for the comparison to Chickenfoot where half of Van Hagar currently lies.  First of all, on both albums Joe has a very different tone than EVH and I believe this is intentional.  If you even listen to Joe's song \\"I just wanna rock\\" of the \\"Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock\\" album you can see where he uses thetone created by EVH.  However in Chickenfoot he has decided to have a tone much more similar to Jimi Hendrix and Keith Richards.  Each band is different with Chickenfoot being the more bluesy of the two.  Van Halen in contrast is more in your face and where the origional Van Halen always was.  Personally, I connect more with the lyrics in Chickenfoot.  Lyric in songs like Runnin' Out, Something Gone Wrong, and Dubai Blues communicate with me.  Additionally, Chickenfoots back round vocals have that signature sound I loved in Van Hagar.  However, I like the general Tone on Van Halen's A Different Kind of Truth more than Chickentfoot.  The new Van Halen just rocks harder which is sometimes whats called for.  My favorites on the new album are Beats Workin, You and Your Blues, HonnieBabySweetieDoll and Blood and Fire  Favorite line : (Blood and Fire) \\"Told you I was coming back\\"  Its really too bad EVH wouldn't let Chickenfoot open for Van Halen.  That would be the ultimate concert.  However, they would have to somehow incorporate Steve Vai too... just to make everything complete.  After reading Hagar's accounts of the 2004 concerts in RollingStone, I can see where Wolfie had to walk though a mile of ugly stuff with his dad.  From what I read, Eddie's trouble with drugs truely cost him and his family.  Wolf sounds good on A Different Kind of Truth and while I miss Mikey, I won't begrudge Wolf his dues.
B000QXDFQW|4.0|this movie will have you in suspense like crazy. I would definately recommend this move for date night with the hubby:-)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game really stands out.  This is truly one of those games that deserves a 5 star rating for its innovation and entertainment value.  I've installed it on my 5 year old's Nook Tablet and on my own Galaxy Nexus for my own enjoyment.  Unfortunately the 5 star rating (which is what it deserves) can't completely make up for the 1 star rating by clowns who rob the developers of a fair rating.  This is worth buying.  If you missed it as the Free App of the Day, you would find it worth the regular price.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I believe that it will get better. I also own a Toshiba Thrive running Android Honeycomb 3.1, and Huff Post just released a completely reformatted version for it and it is VERY well done; almost perfect. I expect, or rather I hope that they will do the same for the Kindle Fire soon. I love my new Fire!!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Fantastic chip, runs really cool and has brought the temps down in my system quite a bit (the new case helped as well).  Highly recommend this or it's i5 cousin, as you won't be disappointed.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|At first I had some trouble downloading this app. It took me awhile, with a little help, but I finally got it to work. I don't know if it was just my kindle fire not working or what, but I am SO happy it worked. Its super fun, and I don't think you should even hesitate to buy. The challenges are tough, but manigeable. And if you really do get stuck there is always the hint guide under the journal. Its SO great! Best $2 I EVER spent!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great idea. The set up and use of amazon's \\"cloud\\" was really easy. A little reading/research, a few clicks, and good to go.<br />The MP3 \\"downloader\\" was even easier...<br /><br />Now I have access to my music collection from any internet link. I don't have to worry about transporting my CD's, or getting them scratched, stolen, or otherwise damaged/lost.<br /><br />I can download or stream over my laptop, smartphone, and still transfer to my MP3. My music collection is very easy to deal with now, and I have more options than ever. No more lost, stolen, or scratched CD's!! (YAY!!!)  =)
B005TZFZJC|1.0|I don't remember what was my first impression when I heard about Rihanna, I couldn't help but notice How easy it was for me to listen to a song of hers, shrug my shoulders and couldn't even remember the lyrics the next day. That much impression she made on me. Now, years later that she's obviously more popular and has a fan base growing by the minute as well as countless albums. With an album popping *every* year I couldn't help but question the abilities that singer has that she managed to get an album record every year, as well as her songs that get numerous radio play and of course in bars and clubs as well.<br /><br />After listening to and skimming through tracks from this album as well as every other album she made, I finally formed my opinion about Rihanna and here's my conclusion; she CAN'T sing.<br /><br />I won't say that she's completely talentless, I mean she must have some sort of talent to manage any success at all. But most of her talent doesn't involve singing, she's naked all the time which gets her all the attention but come on ! I'm saying this to the music industry do we really need another sex selling/pop singer wanna be porn star ? As if Britney spears weren't enough.<br /><br />No, I'm not completely anti-modern mainstream music (I'm not claiming that). I listen to Lady Gaga and while I don't find her the most talented person ever emerged at least she's entertaining and she can sing better than Rihanna.<br /><br />Rihanna can't even write one song by her own to save her life, so if I ever liked any of her songs in the past the credit wasn't for her it was for the writers who wrote it to her and the composers who composed her music. To be honest I found some of her songs Catchy such as We found love but they get tiring to listen to after a while, and frankly her voice is irritating, she hasn't got that natural singing beautiful voice ..... OK !<br /><br />I think Her previous Album Loud & Good Girls Gone Bad [regardless of How Naive and childish it was] were the peak of her career and the best she can contribute to the music world and it's not the most legendary/epic musical act out there as you can see.<br /><br />I'm tired of her music, I think she's overrated and I couldn't help but backslash. Obviously many fans and people out there will disagree with me and I have to remind you that I'm only offering my personal opinions. To each it's own!<br /><br />So, Miss Rihanna Please Stop Making Music, We are tired of your formulaic music !she can contribute to the music world and it's not the most legendary/epic musical act out there as you can see.  I'm tired of her music, I think she's overrated and I couldn't help but backslash. Obviously many fans and people out there will disagree with me and I have to remind you that I'm only offering my personal opinions. To each it's own!  So, Miss Rihanna Please Stop Making Music, We are tired of your formulaic music !
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Its soooo fun! I loaded it because it was free today. but I CANNOT put it down :) it has good graphics, family friendly and it keeps my baby cousin VERY entertained.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|it's our family favorite movie  it is funny and really touching  my husband and i love to watch this as well
B0002VFXFE|5.0|used on an Asus U36SD-A1, for anyone not in the know, it's was the world's first sub inch (19mm thick!) notebook with a standard voltage 2nd generation Intel CPU..  so in layman's terms this thing was hot! (Spiking 51'C Idle and 88'C under load) and the dedicated GPU didn't help ( 47'C idle and 79'C under load).  Since throwing my warranty to the wind and applying this thermal grease Idle has dropped CPU temp by an average of almost 10' C, and GPU by an average of about 3'C, Under load (Skyrim) CPU temp has dropped around 10'C !! (Temperature spikes lower than the normal temperature had been!) and GPU saw about a 5'C drop! This is also in an environment that he ambient temperature went up by 5'F !<br /><br />All I can Say I WOW!
B0059R5Q08|3.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This version of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel is intriguing, to say the least. The technique of telling most of the story as a flashback is a bold move, but honestly, I found it to be distracting. The score by Dario Marianelli (Pride And Prejudice) is excellent, and there are some good moments between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Unless you know the story very well (and I've read the novel several times, the last one being around six months before this version came out, so I do know the story very well), you will find yourself asking, \\"What exactly is going on here?\\" Plus, there are a lot of moments from the novel which are cut out from this adaptation that are present in other film versions, notably the 1983 version starring Timothy Dalton (which is my personal favourite). For instance, Adele's backstory is merely hinted at, and Mr. Rochester's climactic scene with Jane is nowhere near as dramatic as in the 1983 version. Plus, I found Ms. W.'s Austrailian accent very distracting (Jane Eyre is English, according to the book). I recommend this movie for only people who know the story very well; otherwise, you'll probably think that the original novel is boring and thereby close yourself off to some of the greatest literature ever written. This version should have been rated PG.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i lov it. it s worth paying money the animal is cure 2 i say get it and u will lov it
0440242401|5.0|i really really loved this book. i loved that we were getting to know the character as she was getting to know herself. i've already read this book at least 3 times!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Amazing game its truly unique and one of a kind version of Tetris. I recommend  downgrading it!! As addicting as cut the rope!
B004M2305O|3.0|this is not some average bang bang go get em boys combat movie. it is, however, in my view, one of the best tv series ever done. if you or someone you know, that may like a british tv series about P.O.W.'s, then this may be it.<br />i myself enjoy this. some folks will call it a melodrama soap opera style.  i don't care about that. people can criticize all they want. it's my choice for a good ww2 series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Plenty of games to keep anyone at any age busy for hours!  Games are fun and challenging.  Great to play while in the car, plane, or just home in the jammies.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I bought this album because it has the same mood all the way through.  I can put in on with a bottle of wine in the hot tub and totally relax and not get stressed because every other track is of a different tempo.  It is all the same.  This music \\"is intended to paint a romantic scene, candle lit dinners, a walk along a moonlit beach, quiet nights\\" as stated before.  \\"There's no difference in the way she sings Cry Me A River, Besame Mucho, S'Wonderful, or Maybe You'll Be There\\".  And that's exactly why I love this album and Diana Krall.  If you don't like a bottle of wine in the hot tub and a painted romantic scene and quiet times and good music then go get \\"Guns & Roses\\" stuff.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Accept were a band that got mildly big in this country for a short time back in the 80's and probably best known for their metal anthem \\"Balls To The Wall\\" featuring the gravely vocals of Udo......I can't remember how to spell his last name.  The band lasted up until the mid-90's and then appeared to disband for good.  Fast forward to 2010 and the band have re-formed with a different vocalist.  Yea we have all heard this story before from other 80's era bands, but what Accept have managed to do successfully is put out one hell of a kick ass metal record.  New vocalist Mark Tormillo has brought new life to the band and this is a take no prisoners metal tour de force.  I am not really an expert on this band and have only seen them live once many years ago, so I somewhat came at this release with fresh ears.  To me this is one of the best metal albums by anyone in the last two years.  It will not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who like this style of music, it does not get much better than this.
B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|Sorry folks this one is grossly over rated and the acting is pedestrian at best.  It's a cliche that the book is better than the movie but in this case that doesn't even begin to tell the tale of this film.  First of all, it is not a good movie. Period.  The script is riddled with errors, the dialog is dull and if you cut out all the thoughts of the actors contemplating and staring you have a 90 min movie.  The pacing is brutally slow and the film lacks any heart or emotion.  This movie is better than a sleeping pill if you have insomnia.  I will only touch briefly on the whole Moneyball myth.  True baseball fans know that it is a myth and is a style which was used by the Kansas City Royals in the 1970s was used by the Cleveland Indians in the 1990s to win several division titles and perfected by the Boston Red Sox to win in 2004.  Billy Beane copied the work of others and acted as though he invented it. The reason Jonah Hill's character is a composite is because the two characters he represents were fired by Billy Beane when he thought they were getting too much credit.  Basically, this movies is dull and boring and wildly inaccurate. If they have an Oscar for the dullest movie of the year, this is it!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|My father-in-law is 90 years old and very particular about his likes and dislikes. This was one of the items on his Christmas list this year. We ordered from Amazon, the CD's were sold out early in the retail stores.  Pop likes all the old time singers, Bing, Frank , Dean and the few younger singers that he enjoys are Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Buble. He plays this CD over and over again and he is very happy with it. It is easy on the ears, nice background music for the holiday season.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|My wife and I went to see this for different reasons; she thought that 'it looks fun'...me, I wanted to see the graphics.<br /><br />She was quite correct, this is a VERY fun film, a fast-paced and enjoyable adventure with an 'Indiana Jones' flair to it.<br /><br />For my part, I will state that these were the best graphics I have ever seen on the screen. The detailing is perfect, I noted that I could see characters` individual hairs being blown by breezes during scenes. The characters themselves were depicted with an almost surrealistic blend of realism mixed with exaggerated facial details that added a comic book effect while giving you an almost photographic reality in an animated world.(I`ve already pre-ordered the Blu Ray)<br /><br />Now, all that was fun... here is where the 'wonder' from my title comes in...<br /><br />Seeing this movie makes me wonder why Stephen Spielberg makes us wait for years upon years to see another live-action 'Indiana Jones' adventure with an ever-aging Harrison Ford ?<br /><br />There could just as easily be new Indiana Jones adventures--with 'Indy' in his prime--voiced by Ford with graphics such as found here. Granted, the location fiming in the Indiana Jones movies was a vital aspect of them, but it strikes me that the character and the adventures count for a bit more (otherwise it`s just a glorified travelogue).<br /><br />If the sort of 'Hyper-Reality' found in TINTIN can be created, then why not apply the tech to characters such as Indiana Jones ? I would certainly be willing to pay to see Indy in action, looking good again, in his 30`s or 40`s..back in the 30`s or 40`s... rather than wonder if Spielberg, Lucas & Ford are going to get around to making one more movie before Ford gets too far past the believability point in years for an 'action/adventure' character.<br /><br />Makes me wonder....<br /><br />But, I digress...Give TINTIN a try. He won`t let you down...<br />( Snowy won`t either!)
B003E6K1VK|4.0|it is a nice piece, nice packaging, but the price is much more on what i have expected!!  i am really disappointed from this item, since i have ordered the FIIO 5 and it works very nice and satisfying considering the price and size.  for this one, my mac mini is more powerful, i have audio technica m50 and HD 595, and both are more powerful without the FIIO 7, also, using the earphone klipsch s4 image, same results. .... badly!  when volume is turned over level 20, the bass is completely lost and mids and highs distorted, and there is no quality in the songs.  i wish i didn't buy since i am not satisfied.  I bought based on the rates and reviews i saw, unless i have defected item, so i cannot judge if it is defected or not, but what i am sure about is that my mac mini port is powerful more than it.  the one star i gave only is for the usb option, so i advise who doesn't have any sound card, buy this device and listen to music and that's it.......  for others .... don't buy!  (Problem is solved, thanks Amazon, thanks FiiO)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|finally Amazon steps up to the plate and offers a useful educational game that will help America. Once my daughter masters Bag It she will be able to get off my couch and get a job. I am going to petition the community college to see if mastering Bag It will give her credits toward her dashing degree. This game is just what I needed thanks.
B000002KE2|4.0|As the title of the album would suggest \\"Volume 4\\" was Black Sabbath's fourth studio album.  This one would follow an amazing string of 3 previous albums; all considered classics by both fans and critics.  \\"Volume 4\\" would see the quality dip oh so slightly and find the band experimenting with new sounds, but this was still Sabbath in their prime and another great addition to their catalogue.  The best songs on this one are probably their love song to Cocaine \\"Snowblind\\" and the rocking \\"Supernaut\\".  The album contains the band's first ballad in \\"Changes\\".  Whether this song works or not has been the subject of great debate among Sabbath fans for years.  I like it ok, but it was probably a shock to their fan base back in 1972.  Overall there are quite a few Sabbath albums I like better than this one, but it is another good one from the founders of heavy metal.
B0011BBA3S|1.0|There is no reason to make up alternatives to Darwinian evolution.  They chose to write this which is practically a crime.  Why do TV sci-fi writers have such problems with Darwinian evolution?  The guest characters are all okay.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great Bag For the Price unfortunately living in Costa Rica the import Dutys doubled the price of the bag but still a solid purchase. Just got it so well see how it holds up over time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like when u read everything is organized And when u look stuff up it is very easy to find. 5 stars
1582701709|5.0|[[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]]<br />Great book and very motivational to read.I thought this book was very up lifting. However, I do not take everything too literal, but if you want a nice motivational pick me up type of book I would definitely recommend this book. There are some valuable points in this book that really can be applied to our everyday lives.
1594744769|5.0|I first expected this to be a haunting thriller, and it was clear from the beginning that it wasn't.  BUT, it turned out to still be an amazing book about a teen's journey to uncover his grandfather's secret past.  What he finds is shown to us with creepy and peculiar old photographs, and the book is a great read, becoming an edge-of-your-seat can't-put-it-down story at the end.  I hope there's going to be a sequel!

B006PHD0RW|1.0|I like to think that a Desire HD is a high end device but as this app installs to a black screen of death, maybe the Dev would disagree. Uninstalled &amp; forgotten.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|...but the controls are a mess on my Droid 2. I can move things around fairly well when they're by themselves, but as soon as I try to move one item in a stack the detection goes all to heck. I often end up moving items nowhere near where I a touched. And don't even get me start on how laughably bad the rotation works on my phone. Too bad the rest of the game seems really fun.functional
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This is a great, sturdy laptop stand.  It is very stable and the grippy top surface of the arms keep your laptop from moving or sliding anywhere.  End clips are provided that give the arms a \\"lip\\" if you're worried about your laptop sliding down, but you don't really need them.  Metal arms are very sturdy and the acrylic plastic base seems durable.  The arms just slide into the plastic base, so it is easy to disassemble and transport flat, which is great for me since I use it for mobile DJ'ing.
B005974C94|5.0|Bought this CD for my brother-in-law's birthday.  He had listened to a piece about it on satellite radio while driving to work one day and mentioned he would like to get it.  He has stated that he has really enjoyed it and that the CD didn't disappoint him from the radio review he had heard.  He stated that the combination of Marsalis' and Clapton's talents on this CD were hard to beat.  I can't say that I am much of a Blues and Jazz 'fan' but I have listened to some of the tracks and enjoyed them and agree that its difficult not to like any music these two talented musicians are involved with.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I like this Van Halen release, but there are several missing pieces to what made every previous Van Halen record great. All the Van Halen songs with DLR and Sammy Hagar had memorable song structures with melodic phrases and lines from at least one member of the band that you would find yourself recalling, singing, playing to yourself, or best yet singing along with the song over and over. Who didn't drive around in the Summer with the windows down blaring a VH tape/CD/ song from the radio feeling like you were the coolest person in town? So far after one listen through, this album has NO hook or anthem inducing line that can be instantly stored into memory for later enjoyment. Again this is only after one play of the disc, and maybe I'm expecting too much too soon and I'll keep listening. To prove my point, what Van Halen fan can't immediately recite any number of classic tunes from the VH library; go ahead TRY to forget \\"Ain't Talking 'Bout Love\\", \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", \\"Dance The Night Away\\", Beautiful Girls\\", And The Cradle Will Rock\\", \\"Unchained\\", Panama\\", \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\", Finish What You Started\\", Poundcake\\", \\"Runaround\\", or the various 'keyboard' tunes like \\"Jump\\", I'll Wait\\", \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\", Right Now\\". Listen to this new recording and imagine yourself singing along along with the lyrics at full volume. I will admit that Eddie is still Eddie just minus the riffs that made you want to pick up a guitar and try to play along or even air guitar with. Alex still is terrific, but again there's nothing memorable about his playing here. Wolfgang doesn't seem to help or hurt any of the songs, but you simply cannot attempt to sing along with any of his background vocals the way Michael Anthony made you want to. And David Lee Roth has not produced any wink and a smile lines you can repeat in your head. So I'll give it three stars for Eddie and Alex and maybe in time I might like it more.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|Foer, is a writer who became interested in competitive memory sports after covering an event.  He spent a year learning very old memorization techniques to see if \\"anybody\\" could excel and succeed. Even if you aren't interested in being able to memorize a deck of cards, you will find this book fascinating. Rote memorization is a thing of the past.  If we are bound to have computers that never forget, why bother to remember, right?  Foer makes a good case for a better memory.  How we perceive the world and act in it, is directly linked to what we remember. Really, our memories make us who we are.<br /><br />The book sets forth several memorization processes.  I used one six days ago to learned a list of 15 things.  I still remember them today.  Me remember? Not too long ago I lost my car!  It would have been wonderful if we had a memory club when I was in high school and so much more worthwhile than being in the \\"Bleacher Babes\\".  Gosh, if I was just a little younger and a whole lot less lazy, I would even consider making it a hobby now.<br /><br />This is not a boring self help book.  It is a story.  It has a moral.
0736092269|5.0|This isn't a book that you'll just read through, but it as a lot of visuals to show what muscles are being worked for a large number of exercises. I think it's facinating, and for good measure it includes some tips on the form and why that form is important, and possible alternatives. It also gives a lot of examples of possible injury and how to avoid them. It's just amazing to see how all the muscles and skelton and everything all works together. Just a lot of fun, I look through it almost every day.

B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie itself was entertaining to watch. There were a few plot surprises but for the most part  it was pretty predictable. It was awesome to see cowboys and aliens in the same movie. The  movie focuses more on the cowboys and brings it down to earth with their individual human  stories. The characters were all believable. The aliens were pretty much just faceless bad guys.  They're just bad, there's really not much more to their characters. But that didn't matter too much  because we were watching humans either searching for redemption, changing their ways, or  becoming men.  The video was perfect looking. The scenery in this movie was beautiful. It had a lot more foliage  than other westerns that are pretty much out in the total wasteland desert. The surround sound  was extremely active and powerful. It was fun to listen to things happening in all the different  speakers.  The special features so far are really interesting. The interviews with Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford,  Spielberg, Olivia Wilde etc. were much longer than I thought they'd be. They are definitely not  the fluff internet interviews that tell you nothing.  Overall the movie was entertaining, but not amazing. I think I'm still coming to terms with how I  feel about the ending. It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.  CONTENT NOTE: There is a scene that shows\implies what the aliens do to Daniel Craig's Character's wife when she is abducted that really troubled my mother.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case is exactly what I wanted, and works exactly as promised. The case is easy to put on (I am using it with an iPhone 4). I am not using it with the screen protector, so I am not commenting on that. With the case on, the iPhone 4 is not quite as sleek as it is when naked, but the protection the case affords is well-worth the slight sacrifice of beauty, and the result is far from ugly. The case fits the iPhone very precisely and all the cutouts for access to buttons and inputs are in exactly the right places. Perhaps the nicest feature of the case for me is the fact that its surface has a higher friction coefficient than the iphone itself, so it sticks very securely in your hand and you feel confident that you are not likely to drop it.
B001RTP3YQ|3.0|The songs, the singing, the band are fine, but I hated having to listen to all the protracted applause, the mumbled patter, etc. I guess you had to be there, but since I wasn't, 3 stars for the production.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I bought Breaking Dawn part 1 the day it came out.  Yes I was one of the people at Walmart after midnight to get it.<br /><br />I thought it was tastfully done so younger people would be able to watch it as well as adults.  I also thought it is true to the book.  I always want to see more in the movie that was in the book but this one is good.<br /><br />I has always planned on getting the final movies in this series but am pleasently surprised on how good it was.  I was even surprised I figured out where they were going to break the movie before the next one.<br /><br />The computer graphics are outstanding in the movie.  They are viturally seamless throughout the movie.  The behind the scenes are very interesting.  They go into great detail on how they did the special effects.<br /><br />I would recommended this movie to any one.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|I got this version of the Blu-ray because I didn't mind not having a DVD copy of the movie or the memorabilia. I got it at Barnes and Noble for like $8.74 because it was on sale and I had a coupon.  The movie itself was highly enjoyable and I was in to it from start to finish. You have to have patience to watch these older movies, but it really pays off and you leave more satisfied than after watching newer movies. I enjoyed that you are not sure if you like what Alec Guinness' character is doing with the bridge. On one hand, he is right in keeping his men busy and helping them to build something they can be proud of. But on the other hand, he is helping the enemy build a quality bridge. The surgeon\medic prisoner is disgusted the whole time by the Colonel's (Alec G.) viewpoint on building such a nice bridge. The end 30 minutes get really intense as it cuts back and forth between the bridge building and a commando team sent to destroy it. I won't give away the ending, but it is definitely worth sitting through start to finish. My wife and I had a great discussion about hubris and the differing virtues of the characters' different decisions.  As far as Picture Quality goes, it was beautiful, especially for a movie this old. The image was incredibly detailed and the cinematography just made it that much more enjoyable (it also won an academy award for that). There was one transition between scenes where it shows the same image of a bird twice like it was a glitch with the original negative.  The Sound was clean and clear. Dialog was easy to understand and the music came through nicely. As far as the surround sound goes, it was pretty mild but still made you feel like you were there in the jungle.  Extras: I haven't watched these yet. The Theatrical trailer was nice though, and didn't give too much away if you want to watch it before starting the movie.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone from teen and up. I watched it in Jr. High in a history class and didn't really get in to it. It is a great movie that sparks meaningful conversations. Worth owning to watch every once and a while, especially at a good price.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

If you don't want it then don't download it but don't be making mean, nasty, disrespectful &amp; hurtful comments on a board that young impressionable people are reading on a regular basis!!!  As the mother of 2 disabled children I take serious offense to the fact that you are poking fun at people with disabilities &amp; referring to them in a negative manner. Unfortunately the rest of us don't live in your perfect &amp; make believe  world but on the real world with real problems &amp; with a heart &amp; conscience.  You should be totally ashamed of yourselves!  Do you realize some of those disabled people are disabled because they go &amp; fight for your rights every day just do you have the freedom to slander the way you do &amp; end up disabled or give their lives  as a result of that.  Funny &amp; joking around are one thing. Making fun of people for being who they are is quite another &amp; crossing the line of human decency.  Aren't you SO PROUD that you are a fan of that!  Now, as for the FAOTD,  it is absolutely hilarious!  Not only is it fun for kids but adults as well.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I never get music when it is first out. One reason is, it takes awhile for me to decide to get it. I like every song on this album and that is rare. I couldn`t find it in the stores in my area, so I ordered off amazon.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Shame is a brave, uninhibited film about a man crippled by his addiction to sex. This could have been the premise for a comedy, but British director Steve McQueen and his co-writer Abi Morgan have made it a startlingly powerful drama that tackles the subject head-on and with utter seriousness. This is McQueen's second film after his highly acclaimed, 2008 debut Hunger and he has once again cast Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Things have changed since 2008 and Fassbender's name carries more clout than it did previously. If Fassbender had made this film as an unknown actor, this would have garnered him some attention.  Sex addiction is a tricky subject to make a serious-minded film about. Most men cannot fathom how this type of addiction could be debilitating and may actually envy Fassbender's plight. Secondly, when you explore the depths of sex addiction in the frank, unflinching way this film does, you're risking mismanagement of the material. Showing a character's rendezvous with a trove of women is not too difficult, but showing these actions as driven by compulsion and anguish is. When you have to show a character so consumed with sex that he must constantly watch porn, masturbate, or go to whatever lengths necessary to achieve orgasm, you're running the risk of an audience giggling through the entire film. Furthermore, when your film has as much full-frontal nudity and simulated sex as this one, you run the risk of the audience finding it arousing which effectively destroys the impact of what's being shown.  Somehow, without the term \\"sex addiction\\" ever being mentioned out loud, this film manages to plunge the abyss of sex addiction with a strong sense of sincerity and show a character imprisoned by it. Nothing about the addiction portrayed is laughable and the many scenes of nudity and sex are far from erotic. People love to call porn \\"art,\\" but most people will admit (in secret) that most scenes of a sexual nature referred to as \\"art\\" and \\"non-erotic\\" are far from artistic and very erotic. None of these scenes in Shame are erotic and McQueen's profession as an artist is remarkably apparent in the way he has shot this film and put it together.  There was a difficult, but clear-eyed view of how this film was supposed to be and nothing ever comes across as insincere or overwrought. It's a very elegant-looking film with a couple of mainstream actors turning in powerhouse performances. The film has netted attention for its NC-17 rating and the refusal to appeal it. In a rare decision, the studio and filmmakers chose to embrace the rating rather than view it as a stigma. This was a smart decision, as nothing in Shame could have been toned down without sacrificing what makes it so effective in the first place.  Fassbender plays Brandon, a handsome, 30-something man living in New York City. He has a generic, suit-and-tie job and is well-off financially, but the specifics are unimportant. His private life is carefully cultivated to help guard his sexual compulsions which involve online porn, frequent masturbating, prostitutes, and picking up women for random physical encounters. Order in his life is important to him, as he's ashamed of the addiction that drives him. This carefully constructed lifestyle is crashed by the unexpected arrival of Sissy (Carey Mulligan), his little sister.  It's here that the movie could misstep by allowing this contrivance to push the film into Hollywood soap-opera territory. McQueen's command over the material instead provides open-ended implications into childhood trauma that may have lead to Brandon's uncontrollable lifestyle. There is the implication that both suffered something in their childhood that had a profound effect on the people they've become, but the film offers no easy answers. There is no heavy implication of any particular tragedy or abuse, no mention of mistreatment by a mother or father; the most revealing line of dialogue is Sissy telling Brandon \\"we're not bad people, we just come from a bad place.\\" It's these concise flourishes of brilliance that fuel the development of these characters and their traits. The film allows us to fill in many of the blanks for ourselves, providing enough to elicit thought-provoking interpretations. The ambiguity doesn't make it unapproachable or inaccessible, just all the more fascinating and compelling.  Shame is composed of long, unbroken shots and mostly superfluous dialogue. Here is a film brave enough to hold a close-up of Carey Mulligan for roughly five minutes, with only one or two brief cutaways, as she sings `New York, New York.' This scene is remarkably powerful. Nothing in the rather minimal dialogue is particularly revealing about the psyche of the characters and McQueen brings us into Brandon's suffering using the artistic finesse that he brings to directing and through the acting prowess of Michael Fassbender.  The opening sequence illustrating Brandon's daily routine sets the mood appropriately, with a sweeping score by Harry Escott (that does appear to have been borrowed significantly from Hans Zimmer) that brilliantly complements what's onscreen. One of these early scenes shows Brandon's attention drifting to a woman on the subway, while sounds of sexual pleasure interrupt the soundtrack. They proceed to flirt with each other for a couple minutes without ever saying a word.  It's become a cliché to call an actor `brave' whenever they do something decidedly un-mainstream, like graphic nudity. It's appropriate for what Fassbender does here. He has several scenes of full-frontal nudity, but it's not just his flesh that's exposed. This is a brave, dedicated performance that shows him baring not only his skin, but his soul. A fearless actor, he builds a fully realized character and brings the audience into the anguish and suffering that Brandon feels without spoon-feeding his emotional state to the audience. He captures the isolation, the inability to form emotional connections. When Brandon reaches the peak of his desperation, Fassbender reminds us of what great acting truly is. There's not a note in his performance that seems false or forced, and the intense, personal emotion he portrays transcends mere acting. There are a lot of sex scenes and Fassbender convincingly emulates a man driven by necessity and compulsion rather than pleasure. These desires, these emotions, and that hollow emptiness he so perfectly captures could not have been easy to tap into. This is the best performance of 2011, by far.  Carey Mulligan is one of the most talented young actresses working today, but her previous roles reveal why McQueen was initially hesitant to cast her. Her role as Sissy is such a departure from her performances An Education, Never Let Me Go, and Drive, performances that are all, in one way or another, cut from the same cloth. Unlike Brandon, whose physical appearance betrays his internal trauma, Sissy wears her wounds inside and out. It's surprising to see this elegant, quiet actress play such a brash, trashy character with no respect for the boundaries that Brandon has to maintain his existence. The scenes they share pulse with tension, the lingering effects of a traumatizing past, and repressed emotion that give the film a jolt of raw realism.  At 99 minutes, Shame seems to run much longer. I did not find it tedious; in fact, I was so glued to my seat that I didn't move until the credits. It's just such an unflinching character stud that goes to some dark places to explore its main character. It gets under your skin, clutches your emotions, and leaves you feeling shell-shocked. Shame is a thought-provoking, poetic, and unforgettable film that tackles a rarely-discussed subject with great courage and vision. It's a movie you experience rather than passively view, alternatively graceful and gritty. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Beautifully directed, Shame contains two of the year's most powerful performances and is easily the most powerful filmof the year. An adult drama that doesn't sacrifice artistic integrity in favor of commercial viability or accessibility, few films succeed at so effectively shaking up their audience. This is an uncompromising piece of filmmaking that travels into the depths of despair and depravity. When the credits roll, you'll feel like you've been assaulted.  GRADE: A

There are one or two small tears in each of the book, and the 4th book is missing 20% of a sheet (so I'm missing the words for 2 pages). some smeared ink as well for some reason =/  However, given the price, I would still go for it. really doesn't affect the enjoyment of the tale.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am super surprised at all the bad reviews! And I am not a die hard fan or twilight fanantic. I am just a woman in her 30's who likes a good book. I mean, I was so satisfied with the final installment of this series. I had been waiting and waiting and waiting for Bella to finally become a vampire and FINALLY I was satisfied. The other three books were like a waiting game a craving for Bella to finally become a vampire, for things to finally resolve. And this book was all about finally satisfying all that waiting.  Someone complained that Bella was no longer the same character, and someone else said \\"where was the author going with all her clumsiness, and now all of a sudden, she was no longer clumsy.  OF COURSE she's not the same. She's a vampire now. I mean, she is the answer to everyones fantasy about becoming a graceful powerful, vampire. Perhaps she was a foil to herself in a literary sense, her previous clumsiness accentuating her sudden grace.  It is pure satisfaction to see her change. I reveled in it after waiting so long!  And so many complained about Jacob imprinting on the baby. GET OVER YOURSELVES people! Open your minds. You say it is \\"disgusting.\\" The author specifically explained that it is a pure soulmate type love, not something disgusting. These are not humans, they don't have the same lifespans as we do, they don't have the same rules. 20 years is the blink of an eye. I mean, REALLY!  Anyway, this book, of the series is the one I loved the most. All things were wrapped up, all satisfaction given. LOVED IT!
B006ISJQBM|3.0|The Rum Diary is based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, written in the early `60s but not published until 1998. Similarly, this adaptation began shooting in March of 2009 and was not released until October of 2011. After a 19-year-absence, Bruce Robinson returns to the director's chair and, considering his own problems with alcohol and his landmark film Withnail & I covering similar territory, he was an appropriate choice to direct. Johnny Depp plays the lead role and produces. His love for Thompson is well-documented. He, of course, played Raoul Duke in the adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and was close friends with Thompson. Depp had been trying to get this made for years and it was made with Thompson's blessing, although it did not enter principal photography until four years after his death.  This adaptation has divided audiences. I have not read the novel, but many have said it's unfaithful and leaves out some of the best parts of the book. I can't speak for this personally, but I can't say I'm surprised. Even with no frame of reference, something seems to be missing here. It seems strange that Depp would fight so hard to get this novel adapted for the screen only to throw out the best bits of the novel, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. It's well-known that Thompson wrote the novel after moving to Puerto Rico and unsuccessfully applying for a job as a journalist at The San Juan Star. The movie seems to imagine what would have occurred had Thompson secured the gig.  Opening in San Juan in 1960, Paul Kemp (Depp), a failed novelist and heavy drinker from New York, awakens from a night fraught with drinking. Putting on a straw hat and sunglasses, he goes to his job interview at The San Juan Star. The editor, E.J. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) hires Kemp only because he foresees the newspaper going under.  Settling in, Kemp befriends Bob Sala (Michael Rispoli), the staff photographer and vicariously befriends Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi), a reporter who has retreated so far into the mind of an addict he doesn't seem to be able to consciously realize that he's been fired. While Kemp and Sala get into a series of misadventures around Puerto Rico, Kemp is talked up by Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a shady property developer who wants to manipulate Kemp's journalistic skill to his financial benefit. Sanderson's fiancée Chenault (Amber Heard) may just seal the deal for Kemp.  Anyone expecting Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is going to be disappointed. The essence of Raoul Duke is apparent in Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, but the film and the character are wildly different both tonally and aesthetically. What ultimately brings the film down is that it's a lot of rambling with no sense of direction. The locale is beautiful (the film was actually shot in Puerto Rico), Ms. Heard is exquisitely beautiful, and the actors are fun to watch, but the story isn't compelling enough to be an engaging film. Perhaps the novel was, but Bruce Robinson apparently took too many creative liberties with the story.  With that said, The Rum Diary is a different beast from the average mainstream film. I doubt it would have seen a wide release without Depp's involvement. There's a darkness, a cynicism; a sort of dour pacing that not's often seen in mainstream film. This may be the Hollywood streamlined version of the book, but its European flavor is quite different from the average Hollywood-fare. The way the relationship between Depp and Heard pans out is pretty depressing by Hollywood standards. The film even ends on a sad note, until a title card glosses over everything.  It's clear from his performance that Depp was passionate about this project, even if that passion was ego-driven. Watching him play the more subdued Paul Kemp is just as droll as watching him play Raoul Duke. It's nice to see such a marvelous talent return to some form of reality. It's been a long time since Depp has played a typical human being. His chemistry with Rispoli is nice, comparable to the chemistry he shared with Del Toro in Fear and Loathing. The two share many scenes together and get some poignancy and humor out of those scenes. Ribisi fits nicely into Thompson's world; hilariously over-the-top, but fascinating to watch.  The Rum Diary is interesting and quirky, but ultimately a bit of a failure. Considering the talent involved it should have been so much better. It fails to engage its audience and doesn't develop enough story or character, despite a two-hour running time. If nothing else, The Rum Diary has inspired me to read the book just so I can see what a missed opportunity this was.  GRADE: C+

1595827684|5.0|I am a huge fan of the ME series and in addition to the game, own several of the comics and previous art books.  In advance of the ME3 release, I was happy to pick up this universe art book too.  The book itself is big, hard bound, and features terrific, colourful, glossy images.  If you are a ME fan you are sure to enjoy this.  However, since I own several other ME books I figured this review would be more useful highlighting the differences as far as I can tell.  Mass Effect 1, pages 10-59  This sections details a lot of the concept work in ME1 including the alien species and the design aesthetic, such as the vehicles, mass relays, and weapons.  I have the 2007 Art of Mass Effect book that came with the Prima strategy guide and some of the content in the Universe book overlaps it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to see new content as well.  Given the 170+ pages of the 2007 book they could have easily poached from it wholesale to fill 49 pages so I am very pleased they added in stuff that I hadn't seen before; quite a feat given ME1's release 5 years ago.  Mass Effect 2, pages 62-129  This section is awesome and I have been eagerly awaiting the ME2 art content for some time now.  I have the Prima Collector's Edition strategy guide for ME2 that has a small art section which is disappointing, showing mostly in game shots and some 3D renders.  I have the ME2 Collector's Edition art book as well, the one included in the game, 48 pages long and about the size of a 4x6 picture, give or take.  This one contained more concept work of the various worlds and some of the technology, like the Normandy 2, but was also underwhelming given it's size.  Thus, I was very pleased to see the content in the Universe book for ME2.  Each major character (squad mate) gets a nice character study with some concept images and some text describing the designer's intentions.  This includes DLC content like the Shadow Broker, Katsumi, and Zaeed.  There is also great concept images of the various planets and locales visited.  Also, if you like weapons, there's a two page spread of ME2's guns.  It's very well done and really show cases the game's content well.  This is definitely the ME2 artwork I'd been waiting to see although I'm sure they could have put together a 170+ page ME2 art book alone if they wanted to.  Mass Effect 3, pages 130-182  As I am in self-imposed spoiler isolation, I refuse to open this section of the book.  Suffice to say, if it's anything like the rest of the book then I am sure it will be fantastic!  Well, to be honest, I have flipped through it and yes, there are concept images and character studies in it it seems, although I won't spend any more time in the book beside's thumb-flipping until I can get the game, beat it, and then see where the story went!  A great book and welcomed in any ME or sci-fi fan's book case for sure.
B006NFKUF6|3.0|I really did not like this game it sucked big time and the controls are complex I never under stood the game and it rushes into the story line and the last transmission wasn't even there so they really need to work on the game.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie which was fabulously entertaining with lots of laughter and clean fun!  This is a movie I watch again and again!
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Fun to play but takes forever to load on a Thunderbolt. About every 3 launch it doesn't start &amp; I have to either force close or kill with a task manager. Devs need to figure out some way to optimize this game for better performance.

B006PHD0RW|3.0|this game is really fun but the controls to rotate the objects could be 100% better.  A simple button or double tap rotate would be much better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app helps you tell weather for any time of day. has weather for the next five days. shows you videos of different channels on the Tv. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a weather app. ACuuWeather for aneroid app in the best you can get. Hope this review helps you.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game! Soooo excited it is faotd! Even if it weren't,  it's definitely worth the money! I would give it 6 stars if I could!
B006ISJQBM|1.0|I really like most Johnny Depp films.  It's too bad Sony continues to put out blu-ray releases that have lossless audio tracks corrupted with cinavia.  This would have been a purchase for me, but now will be strictly a rental at best.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought the Garmin 405CX after reading many positive Amazon reviews.  I consider myself a pretty competitive runner (1:28 1/2 marathon recently) and after logging a few hundred miles I am very happy with it.  GPS tracks very well in all conditions (rainy, cloudy, in the trees, even inside).  The touch bezel does take some getting used to, but I just lock it when doing a workout so I don't accidently hit any buttons.  Definitely use the auto-lap feature since you will likely want to know your mile splits anyways.  The one complaint I have with the watch is the pace does not update very quickly so if you wanted to do a speed workout on regular roads it's hard to get accurate pace readouts.  Supposedly it updates every 10 sec, but more accurately about 30-40 seconds in my opinion.  The Garmin Connect website is very nice especially with the USB wireless data transfer.  All you have to do is walk near your computer and the run data transfers automatically.  Very nice feature.  The watch is a little bulkier than I expected, but I don't hardly think about it during the run and I usually run 6-7 min/mile pace during normal workouts.  I did not buy the optional foot pod since a treadmill will track everything for you if you must run inside.  I have not had any issues with the GPS outside so I don't see any need for the foot pod.  I have not tried out the heart rate monitor yet so I cannot accurately comment on that accessory.  Overall, a great and affordable buy for serious runners.
1612130283|5.0|This is book one in a series of three. All of them a must read.For me personally this is an equisite series and i recommend them all. They are emotional and heart warming, the stories flow and ebb into eachother. They are not dragging you along. They captivate you. I highly recommend this series.  Book 1/ Fifty Shades of Grey.Book 2/ Fifty Shades Darker. 3/ Fifty Shades freed. Get the entire series you will not regret them. I saw one person stated she \\"Hated it\\" strong words such a shame one cannot follow the story as lovely as they are. Oviously she is not emotionally balanced. One should never throw words such as these out there unless of course the only reason is they are seeking attention for themselves. Do yourself a favor and buy the books judge for yourself and do not let someone so pitiful make that decision for you. I stand by my words. EXCELLENT SERIES!
032147404X|5.0|A very informative book that anyone can understand. Even has a little humor. Ive read it cover to cover and now keep it in my camera bag as a reference tool.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i was a bit worried when I realized that this book was targeted towards young girls. being a twelve year old male. I actually enjoyed this book. the plot was refined but the only problem is that I keep on reading untill twelve .and never complete my real work

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The hardest part of Beth Moore Bible studies is the multiple passage look ups. This app is awesome. I love how different versions are downloadable so I can access them even if not connected to the Internet.
B004X80QNG|4.0|This product works great.  Syncs with google fine, and manages my calendar and to do lists.  Works better on 4G and faster phones cuz it loads a lot of graphics.  Would give 5 stars, but when you click Settings>Events>Common>Default Alarm, the max you can get is 30 min.  60 min is what I prefer, and sometimes up to 3 hours is helpful, so I always have to remember to adjust which is a pain.

B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and was excited about seeing this movie. Although it is executed well, it doesn't stay true to the original and tries too hard to modernize the story.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|During two sold out nights at The Fox Theatre (Atlanta, GA) in Sept 2011 the live concert DVD was filmed for the first time in America in front of some of Celtic Woman's most loyal fans. Instead of listening to the CD, I saw the DVD first and not only is the whole performance a sight to behold but the set design and wardrobe were breathtaking. I loved the stunning dresses, that are pictured below, the best. They are gorgeous and the bead work and embroidery is lovely! The set is beautiful too. I love all the scroll work that went into it and the drapery, arch and chandeliers give it a nice touch. I love the opening song of the DVD. Tears of joy were welling up in my eyes at the sight and sound of it. My favorite part of the DVD was \\"The Foxhunter\\". Since I play the violin (albeit not that well) I have a love for violin music. My heart swelled at M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt's performance. She is a spectacular violinist and she can dance while she plays. For \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" they brought on a children's choir to sing with them. For \\"Green Grow The Rushes\\" they involved the audience with the singing. \\"Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann\\" is another violin piece played by M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad, but an Irish clog dancer also takes the stage. The songs \\"My Heart Was Home Again\\", \\"A Tribute to Broadway\\", \\"Green Grow The Rushes\\", \\"Smile\\", and \\"Mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann\\" are additions to the DVD and not included on the CD. The next to the last song on the DVD before the credits, \\"The Parting Glass\\", sets a great grand finale as several bagpipers (more than I have ever seen in a performance) come out of the woodwork and onto the stage to join Celtic Woman. I am so excited to also be able to go to their concert with my husband in April and see them up close in the Keller Auditorium. DISCLOSURE/DISCLAIMER: Thanks to Celtic Woman for sending me product for free to review for free. My thoughts are mine and my family's own opinion and have not been altered by anyone else.

1603420398|5.0|Great motifs, the ideas are endless. I got it and just wanted to make them all. It's great that there's all different shapes, too. I have a couple other motif books that just have squares. If you love making grannies, then you need this book. It's also really nice that it's spiral bound, so it stays open to your page easier.

1451648537|5.0|Some people are so complex they elude even skilled biographers. If this biography of Jobs is not perfect (a little more background on what and how his company was doing would be welcome in a few places, and I had hoped for more comment from Jobs' wife), Isaacson has nevertheless gotten us as close as we will ever get to understanding the genius who shaped major sectors of the modern world. Jobs was a creator who could sometimes don blinders. He was a man with a great intuition for what customers would want but a very uneven record of relationships with his employees and his family. He could be impossibly demanding, or he could stop just short of that and inspire people to great achievements.  He could be generous or nasty for no apparent reason. He had as many misses as hits in the technology world.  But the hits, as Isaacson shows us, were inevitably game-changers.  If working with Jobs could drive people to despair, it is equally true that most people who worked with him, even briefly, make it a point of pride. The anology that came to me while reading this book was not so much other business leaders as military commanders like Patton and Rommel, brilliant, hard-driving men who could make serious mistakes but could also dazzle friend and foe alike with their inventive tactics and resourcefulness. Isaacson should be proud of how well he did the near-impossible.  As in Michael Neufeld's recent biography of Wernher von Braun, he has taken on an enormously difficult subject and turned in a great biography.<br /><br />Matt Bille<br />author, The First Space Race: Launching the World's First Satellites (Texas A&M, 2004)
B001O2S7XA|1.0|I've read other reviews that say this toys works, but ours did not. The car wouldn't go any further than a fifth of the way up the loop.  We started with the Hot Wheels car that was included with the track and went on to try every Hot Wheel car that we own (my 5 year old really wanted this to work).  In the end this was a huge disappointment and a waste of money.  I would advise against buying this.
B005KMX866|4.0|Chris Isaak has a voice that sounds to me like a cross between Elvis and Roy Orbison. He and his band do a great job of covering the Sun hits that pays homage to the original recordings. They also do their own original songs in the classic rockabilly style.
0439023513|2.0|*SPOILERIFIC*<br /><br />I loved the first two books.  This one just didn't hold up in comparison.<br /><br />It wasn't even really the third book that killed the series for me.  It was the last third of the third book.  The first 2/3 hummed along at a pretty good pace and seemed true to the series.  Then the \\"Assassin\\" section came along and was so awful that it darn near undid everything the first 2 2/3 books put together.  At that point I'm guessing Collins decided she had to get out all the things she really wanted to say, the rest of the series (and especially her characters) be damned.  It writing just felt so rushed there.  For the first time, I found myself having to reread bits and pieces to understand what was going on.  Thematically, I suppose I was fine with it, preachiness aside, but the execution was flawed and lazy.  As all the redshirts  got theirs one by one, it all happened so fast that there was never any buildup of tension.  Katniss, Gale, and even Peeta were never in any real danger, not even from each other, and I agree with all the reviewers who are disappointed she spent so much time unconscious during important events.<br /><br />I think having Johanna going nuts was a missed opportunity.  She was a good character, and one of my favorites in Catching Fire.  In addition, she was one of the only characters (in addition to Haymitch) that was able to consistently challenge Katniss.  That Johanna was able to catch Peeta's eye from time to time also made things interesting.  It might have been nice for Katniss to have a real rival (romantically/professionally/whatever) instead of just the struggle against the big bad evil overlord who lives far away.  It was a little boring just having her run roughshod over Gale, Peeta, and the rest of her team.  To have Johanna swept under the rug because she was afraid of water was disappointing.<br /><br />Speaking of Haymitch, it was a disappointment having him MIA for so much of the book.  He was a real star in book 2, and one of my favorite characters in the series overall.  He probably had the best back story of any of the characters, and I think it could have been developed further in 3.<br /><br />I never much cared for Gale, but essentially turning him into a bloodthirsty monster was not cool, and seemed more to be about getting Collins' point of view across and to easily solve the love triangle, rather than any sort of logical character growth.<br /><br />I was able to accept the hijacking of Peeta, unfair as it was, because Katniss had messed with his head for the first two books so much that it seemed like the natural progression.  The real crime, though, was punishing him in the end with a life with her in the tacked on ending and epilogue.  It seemed for a while that his torture had finally given him the self-respect he never had that would have enabled him to stop chasing the girl for a completely one-sided relationship.  The Capitol took so much away from him, but they did give him that.  To have Collins take that away from him in the end, too, was unfortunate.<br /><br />Then there's the ongoing saga of Katniss.  I'm a regular science fiction reader, so suspension of disbelief isn't difficult for me.  Even so, it takes a lot to believe a sixteen/seventeen year-old girl can bring down an entire country and an all-powerful \\"president\\"/dictator.  Given that, I appreciate Collins didn't take the easy way out (one of the few times) with regards to her fighting ability and turn her into some kind of super soldier.  Crack shot with a bow or not, she was pretty worthless in the battlefield.<br /><br />But the real kicker with regards to Katniss is this - I'm supposed to believe she's gone to these games twice, seen all this death and destruction, had so much taken away from her, had a wicked case of PTSD, but was still prone to high school level drama BS?  I spent the first two books wondering why there was any struggle in her mind between Peeta and Gale (who sucked on pretty much every level in comparison).  By the end of the third book I was left wondering why either of them would want her.  It's a real unfortunate parallel to the Twilight series, because, for a while at least, Katniss seemed like someone who would have been worth the trouble.<br /><br />When, in the end, she voted for another Hunger Games, and then she killed President Coin instead of former President Snow, it would have been nice to see some of the cognitive processes that went into that.  Even though the punch was telegraphed from a mile away, it would have been nice to see acknowledgement (even afterwards when she is trying to waste herself away on the morphling in the hospital) that it was anything other than a last-second impulse decision on Katniss' part.  She had suspicions of Coin, but she never decided anything concrete one way or the other.  Which, while consistent with character, was still disappointing.<br /><br />The author killing Prim in the way she did just seemed pointless and cruel.  I guess she did it to be \\"edgy\\" or whatever, but it was just dues ex machina of the worst kind - that which wasn't even needed to achieve the desired result.  I have doubts that Katniss & Prim's mother would have allowed her to go to the front lines as a medic in the first place.  Also, it doesn't really jibe with reality that the medics would have rushed in like that so quickly.  In a real combat situation, they would have been way far back away from the front lines.  Collins writes it like they were hiding just around the corner, even ahead of most of the rebel troops.  Having Katniss see the bombing and figure it all out would have been justification enough without needlessly (and sloppily...had to read that section several times to see what was happening) killing Prim.<br /><br />In Star Wars terms, The Hunger Games was a good Star Wars.  Catching Fire was a good Empire.  Mockingjay was a bad Revenge of the Sith.s left wondering why either of them would want her.

B003K1EYM6|3.0|With some trepidation (from reading the mixed reviews) I bought this iPad2 adapter.  I have a Nikon D300 and only shoot in RAW.  If you: 1)turn OFF you iPad2, 2)plug the iPad adapter into the USB cable you've attached to your camera and turn ON your camera, 3)then plug the adapter into your OFF iPad and THEN turn the iPad ON, it should work well.  Any other combination of steps won't work.  Can't speak for any other camera type.  Can't use the SD card adapter since the D300 uses CF cards.  Personally, this iPad2 was a gift and is the first Apple product I've had in years.  It is a great device but I'm already turned off by the ridiculous device and accessory prices/restrictions all Apple products seem to possess.  This is why I abandoned Apple two decades ago after getting sick of the Mac II with the 20MB hard drive and 1.5MB RAM that cost 2K in '91 dollars.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|I usually keep up quite well with metal trends, which is nearly impossible if you're not a magazine editor or run a well known web site, where access to every CD ever released by every band in the world is easily obtained and usually free of charge.  For those of us who have to buy our music, it's a different story as we decide where to spend our music budgets.  Kids (anybody under 21 as far as I'm concerned, and that's not intended as an insult) are still the biggest consumer of music, as they always have been because they're not burdened with house payments, utilities, medical bills and other stuff that takes up the big part of our paychecks.<br />  So to make a long story short, Mastodon are a band that had slipped through the cracks for me.  Not that I wasn't aware of them, or hadn't heard them on satellite radio.  It was usually a situation of seeing something else I wanted instead.  I must confess, with my age at 51, when a band is tagged as a progressive band, I still think back to the first prog bands like ELP, Yes, early Rush and Genesis.  With the exception of Rush, who always had enough heavy riffs to balance the progressive tendencies, I find, and still find most progressive music boring.  It takes special talent to make long songs interesting and keep up the attention of the listener, so when Mastodon was described as a prog outfit, it made it easier to pass them up.  Not that there isn't great progressive music out there, Opeth and Porcupine Tree being the best of the bunch, and two bands I love.  However, without naming specific bands, it can get a little ridiculous with the overdoing of solos, tempo shifts and what have you, just to show a band can do it.  One band in particular, Kansas, suffered because they threw in passage after passage of needless doodling, and eventually they fell out of favor.<br />  With \\"The Hunter\\" receiving such accolades however, I decided to check 'em out and I'm glad I did.  Some fans decry this somewhat simplified direction the band has taken, and since I haven't really listened to their earlier stuff, I'm not qualified to remark on the stylistic change.  However, as a record that stands on its own, \\"The Hunter\\" is a brilliant album.  Yes, the heavy guitars are there, but it's so cool to hear real vocals and harmonies, not to mention some real atmosphere.  This is a prime example that shows metal can be heavy but also have lots of variety at the same time, which makes a great combination in the hands of the right bands.<br />  Bill Keliher and Brent Hinds are great guitarists who play just the right amount of lead work without resorting to needless wanking that does nothing for the song.  The vocals are great, the drummer is awesome.  This is probably the album that will break Mastodon out into the truly big leagues, and rightfully so.  Cuts like \\"Curl of the Burl\\" with its catchy hooks, and the closer \\"Sparrow\\", which is downright pretty and mournful make \\"The Hunter\\" a must have.band has taken, and since I haven't really listened to their earlier stuff, I'm not qualified to remark on the stylistic change.

0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility is an inspiring, practical book about how we can change the way we interact with others if we chose to.  The authors give examples of how they chose to engage people and share the results it produced for them and their communities.  In every opportunity we get to chose how we will be with one another.  Here's a book about choosing well.<br /><br />I liked the book because it provides steps to achieving the possibility we want: success in all areas of our lives.  I found it interesting to read a Harvard Press business book written by a conductor leading a unique organization: an orchestra.  Until now, I never thought of conducting an orchestra as business.  I guess I looked at it as art, not \\"business\\".  Ben has changed my perspective.  One thing is for sure, it's about leadership and enrollment.  Up until now, I focused on observing the musicians, searching for the story in the music, and rarely paid any attention to the man with the little white stick.  No longer.  It's fascinating to read how Ben leads his teams with humility and grace.  Yes, he messed up with people here and there.  But don't we all?  How wonderful to see a leader ask for forgiveness and clean up his messes.  That takes a lot of courage and humility.<br /><br />This being my second time reading the book (my first was in 2004) I thought I might try something different.  If you feel inspired, you might try it also.  When I reached a reference to music, and there are a lot of them laced throughout the book (he's a conductor, after all), I decided to purchase and listen to the specific piece while reading, to get the full impact of the author's message.  For instance, in chapter seven, Ben uses Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring to illustrate a point about The Way Things Are.  He talks about \\"This heart-stopping moment, conveying the first crack in the cold grip of the Russian winter, can only be truly represented if the player has to strain every fiber of his technical resources to accomplish it.\\"  I was curious what that first crack sounds like.  Not being a musician, I wanted to know what makes it so spectacularly difficult to play.  I also wanted to understand how musicians are coached to produce an amazing performance.  Is it similar to the way a manager coaches an employee through a difficult task?  Or how we chose team members for a project?  Quite possibly.  For me, listening to great music while reading and excellent book enhanced the experience.  As a bonus, I now have a fabulous new playlist specific to this book.<br /><br />Ben and Roz Zander show us that creating possibilities with others is indeed an art form.  The learning in their book is directly applicable to any business owner, manager, or employee in any type of enterprise: For-profit, non-profit, or government.  Lawn care to semiconductor manufacturing.  The book is a resource for problem-solving, project management, team development, and change management activities.  It's not easy, but any genuine effort to incorporate one or more of the twelve practices into our daily lives will create results.  With practice and grace (for us and those around us), we might possibly produce astounding results in our relationships, communities, and organizations.  I am already seeing it.

B0036T31YY|5.0|Takes off a little slow, but when it gets going its sure to leave you wanting more.  One of the best mind trip movies I've seen in some time, all I can say is WOW!
0307593312|1.0|I usually give myself permission to stop reading a book if, after reading half of it, it is just not holding my interest. But I kept reading this book (I admit I skimed the last 1/3) for two reasons: first I kept thinking, \\"it's going to get better\\", and later, \\"I can't believe this book is this bad!!!\\". The first problem with the book is that it is too long; it is drowning in redundacy.  How many times can you describe someone watching a building or knocking at a door? The same trite storylines get repeated over and over(and over!),with apparently no purpose.  This book very easily could have been pared down to 300 pages or less.  Unfortunately, even razor sharp editing would not have helped; the reader would still be left with this weird \\"love story\\".  As other reviewers have noted, there appears to be this adolescent obession with breasts and sex that is gratuitous, and just downright creepy and disturbing.  Even the author must have realized, \\"okay I have to end this\\", which he does, abruptly, and not surprisingly, clumsily.  Maybe he should have had Fuka-Eri to help him with the story.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Silly, cliched, repetitive, derivative, shocking, intellectually childish, and worst of all incredibily pretentious. The worst type of US 'underdog-fights-like-crazy-in-order-to succeed' movie. Avoid at all costs.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is so much fun.  it is probably better that fruit ninja or any of the games in that nature.  I log how u can stack the foods.  and in another mode. you can destroy the food.  no u Ned to desire Roy the food to hat the points.  I think the both modes are.very fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is awesome better than the other games. it has a lot of games that's what I like about it
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I loved the movie but it was very graphic and wierd and uncomfortable. It was a very awkward movie because I watched it with my family. Bella was beyond belief ugly when she was pregnant with a vapire that it was hard to look at her and the whole time I felt bad for Jacob, Edward, the rest of the vampires and warewolves and ESPECIALY Bella's parents. I enjoyed watching this because I wanted to see a happy ending but all I thought about was poor Jacob and Bella's parents who love her so much and they will never see her again. I was sort of disaponted at the end because of all the awkward conversations and graphic scenes in this movie. And the fact that their was blood everywhere and it seemed like Bella was naked the whole entire time even infront of Jacob and Edward's famiily which I couldn't bare to watch. There were some really good parts but most of the movie disturbed me in some ways.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|Finally, some reality...I hope the series is taking a turn from the \\"who's my baby's daddy\\" drama and getting into the nitty gritty of what the world would become if this were to really happen. Shane has some bad qualities, but my hat was off to him this episode. He has the guts to do what others will not. He is a survivor. Rick finally grew a pair as well and I cheered him on on the last part of this episode. Not a lot of zombie action this episode.....but it wasn't needed. They are in survival mode...there's plenty of time to run into zombies, and truth be told.....in a situation like this, there is way more to be feared than zombies. Enjoy! :)

B0055SWM08|5.0|At first it didn't seem to difficult, but there's a few boards that got me stumped.  Thanx for the challenge!
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I watched this when it was on TV, then I purchased it for my girlfriend who is in grad school for clinical psychology since it seemed applicable, I loved watching it a 2nd time even more. I saw things I hadn't noticed before and appreciated the subtle hints and info dropped throughout the episodes that make for a very good ending.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie touches your heart. It tells of relationships between fathers and their children. A man's role as a father and how to take that role seriously. Also how to be accountable to others for how you live your life. The relationship of these men with each other and how they helped, supported and prayed for each was amazing. I would highly recommend this movie for all to see. A family oriented movie. Share this movie with others and watch the men in your life take a new approach on life.
B001DHXT6G|1.0|Totally out of place and stands out like a sore thumb to the rest of the show.  Dumb idea, badly executed.  Annoying, distracting, 'nuff said.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best series of \\"Snicker's for the brain\\" books I have ever read.  The characters are well thought out and you really begin to care for them.  Anastasia is a a strong young woman and is is able to make her position known while realizing her own limitations and flaws.  Christian is at first a (hot) dominating control freak but you begin to care for him as you realize why he is the way he is, as the books go along.  You see a man who is broken and in his own way trying to cope with his damaging past. There are scenes that are breathtakingly sad and others that are just really sweet.<br /><br />I would recommended this series without hesitation.
1451627289|5.0|I have been an avid reader of Stephen King for most of my life and this book is one of his finest.  In my opinion, it is his finest.  It's about time travel, yes, but mostly it's about Jake Epping's experience of living in the 1950's and plotting to stop the Kennedy assassination.  I would respond to those that complain about the details in the book to look at it from that perspective.  Since King is mostly a horror writer, I think that makes people believe he only writes scary, action-oriented prose.  I think of King as a master writer of the human condition and of character development.  The details are what makes you love the characters, live their lives with them.  It makes you care about them and hurt for them.  So, if you're looking for a sci-fi read with a lot of geekiness and action, you might be disappointed- although, I did find it pretty suspenseful, wondering how things would turn out.  If you're interested in a novel about life in the 1950's (from a 2011 perspective), about human beings and what shapes who they are, and, if you like a great love story, this is the book for you.  I cried uncontrollably when I finished it.  It just moved me.  I already miss it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I'll continue to use only Google Music because if your 7&quot; Android tablet ISN'T a Kindle Fire, you don't get any tablet interface.<br /><br />This app looks awful on 7&quot; Honeycomb tablets.
B0041X90D0|5.0|For some odd reason all the reviews for this album are over on the MP3 Version- mostly 5's and a few 4's but no less. I found it odd this album only had two reviews considering the album.  I can't get my brain around how this album and T.Rex's legacy isn't bigger. I've been listening to music of all kinds for a good 30+ years now and I've seen quite a few evolutions but somehow it seems a seminal figure has been completely overlooked and ignored by all but the fans and musicians in the know. What do we fans and musicians know?  TRex did more than just sound cool in a Mitsubishi car commercial, as much as we appreciate hearing his work revived in some public forum. When we talk influence we can talk direct and indirect.  Direct Influence and debt of gratitude:  Prince covered 'Children of the Revolution', as did Bono, the Violent Femmes, Baby Ford, Killers, Soul Wax, and Nena. The song was also (partially) featured in Moulin Rouge, keeping the original spirit of the song and working beautifully.  The Bongos (don't know if you remember this 80's Band) covered 'Mambo Sun'  Bauhaus covered 'Telegram Sam' and got a hit off it.  Witch Queen, 222, Jackie 'O', Ministry and the Power Station covered 'Get it On (Bang a Gong)'  The Fratelli's covered 'Hot Love'  Divina covered 'Ballrooms of Mars'  Guns and Roses covered 'Buck MacKane'  The Replacements, Placebo and Def Leppard covered '20 Century Boy'. Sigue Sigue Sputnik named one of their songs this and simply repeated the title endlessly.  Martin Gore of Depeche Mode covered 'Life is Strange'  The Vindictives covered 'Teen Riot Structure'  Richard Hell and the Voidoids covered 'Rip Off'  Indirect influence:  Man, where do you start? Do you immediately jump to Marc Bolan's (the singer, songwriter, guitarist extraordinaire of the band, in case you didn't know)friend David Bowie who took so much from Bolan at his peak? When you hear Bowie's seminal album 'Ziggy Stardust' you're looking at Bolan's ideas Bowie-ized. I will not suggest Bowie ripped off anything but Bolan was the first and gave everyone in the Glam genre a thorough blueprint. And then you take that and extract what came from Glam- hair bands, punk, new wave... and what came from them? Now there have been a lot of people who have contributed so much to music since Bolan but so many owe so much to the man and his group. But like I said, musicians generally know this where as the public of general listeners have no idea, especially in America.  But that doesn't really bother me so much. What REALLY bothers me is how damn fun T.Rex is and how this just never really took off here in America. Marc Bolan was a modern poet, yet he didn't take himself so seriously he couldn't have a laugh. In the documentary 'Born to Boogie' you catch him pallin' around with Ringo Starr and just doing his best to crack up anyone around and have a great time. He always seemed light hearted, even when he was pouring his heart out in songs like 'Ballrooms of Mars'. And Bolan was a showman/show stopper. Check out 'Hot Love' on YouTube. He cranks it up, gets into it, has a rockin' time and keeps the audience screaming for more. How does a nation ignore such foot tapping, hand clapping sing along goodness? HOW? What else could we want from music? How has he been completely out of the American musical lexicon?  OK, I can come off my self-righteous indignant soap box now and review the album.  I think Slider is the man's best. Not a bad song in the bunch. Some like Electric Warrior better but... I don't know. Slider seems to just never stop rocking or moving while subtly slipping intoxicating poetry throughout. 'I've never kissed a car before, it's like a door.\\" \\"Sitting there, in your armor plated chair...\\" \\"you dance with your lizard leather boots on and pull the strings that change the faces of men\\". The songs here make me sing where ever I am no matter who's around. I can't f'n help it. How can you not sing or at least clap to Metal Guru? How can you notfeel that sexual, exuberant strut of the title track? How can you not feel the exuberant outcry of Chariot Choogle or the rockin' 'Whooo!' in Caddilac? Don't you feel that people? WAKE UP! Get this album back on the radio, and on the lists of one of the greatest ever made! We all know the lists. Stairway to Heaven is tired of hanging out at the top. Stairway wants to dance in the Ballrooms of Mars and drive off in Bolan's Caddilac into a Teenage Dream!  Sorry, I get carried away defending my TRex. Rocking album, my favorite. It's OK if you're not affected by it after one listen, but don't go near the CIA because they will bring you in for being one of the aliens who escaped from Area 51.

B00008A7QK|3.0|I'm lukewarm about Electric Warrior. I know that's a blow to the die hard's who live and breath by it and a welcome knock for those who think it's weak, pointless drivel but I'm not out to increase the stature of any side here. As a matter of fact, I love T.Rex. Mambo Sun and Rip Off are pretty awesome. But I just think he did everything bigger and better on The Slider. In fact, when I first heard this album I was like a lot of people who give it low reviews. I had heard '20th Century Boy' from that Mitsubishi commercial and went out and bought the one TRex album everyone raved about. I was quite disappointed as much as I wanted to adore Bolan. After listening to Electric, I couldn't understand how he had so much influence and, to be honest, I've NEVER liked Bang a Gong. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER. Never will. I just hate that song. And that's the real big one for many, the only song that ever hit it big in the US.  THEN I came across a few singles here and there. Namely 'Teenage Dream' and 'Metal Guru'. I think Metal Guru is what sealed the deal. I was in 'T.Rextasy' from there on. I thought, 'this is what rock music is about.' I also figured that where this came from there must be more, and I found it- on 'The Slider'. I just think that's the most perfect, overlooked, seminal album ever written.  The Slider has much in common with Electric Warrior. Many who like EW think of it as the slightly inferior brother but I see it as Marc Bolan at ease, just waving his magic rocking wand effortlessly and making my feet tap under his Fender+Marshall stack spell. I literally can't help sing along to the songs on that album when I hear them. They just bring me complete joy. Whereas Electric Warrior, in my opinion, tries too hard. EW is pretty amazing considering what a drastic turn it is for the band but The Slider, to me at least, is Bolan at his best with EW a slight second.  I would like to give the album four stars but I just don't like it that much. The label definitely made this version quite the package with the bonus material (namely 'Hot Love') but they could have added that to 'The Slider' and it would have just trounced this album- in my humble opinion. :-p so I can't let it affect my rating.  So to the T.Rex haters I say, try 'The Slider'. Bolan really had magical musical talent and broke new ground that provided a blueprint for so much of what we hear today. To the Electric Warrior die hards I say, sorry it's not my favorite but we're still on the same team. Bolan is a genius and I'm glad that he made music we all can tap our feet in T.Rextasy to. :-)
B005R9PBK8|1.0|First let me say, I absolutely love Supernatural. One of my favorite TV shows out there. However, the 6th and 7th season are TERRIBLE! My wife and I keep trying to watch it when it comes on TV, but we end up turning it off everytime because it's literally like the writer/producer are sitting around naming off every cheesy thing that could possibly happen and going \\"Yeah, that would be hilarious! It's so dumb!\\" and then they put it in the show. It's ridiculous.  You lose your favorite characters, Bobby and Cas, and they replace it with a bucket load of bad animation and a ridiculous story. Every once and a while Sam and Dean's ability to click with each other comes through (which made the show in the first place) and gives you a smile, but other than that it's not even worth watching.  Show should have ended when the original writer left at Season 5.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Loved Ana and Christian's story...I couldn't wait to start the next book. I hate to spoil the book so I won't but this is one intriguing book that you will not want to put down.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|Lots of storage--great with my contours lite stroller. It has a zippered compartment for keys and phone. Easy to attach.
B004EPZ08Y|3.0|All of the \\"Final Destination\\" movies pretty much blend into one big blob of killing beautiful young people in creative ways.  I would offer that FD 5 sticks to the same formula and does it well.  Twenty or so office workers are headed to an off-site retreat when they become stuck on a large bridge under repair.  Suddenly high winds cause a series of events (always fun to watch) that begin to destroy the bridge.  Minutes earlier one of the young workers (Nicholas D'Agosto) has a vision of what will happen.  Like the characters in the previous movies, he's not sure what he's seeing but he knows that he must get others off the bus and the bridge.  Six or seven do (sorry I lost count) and manage to reach safety.<br /><br />As in earlier episodes \\"Death\\" is not happy so begins to pick the survivors off one by one.  There really is no other plot.  There is some young romantic angst between Sam (D'Agosto) and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell, \\"Frozen\\", & TV's \\"The Walking Dead\\") but it isn't important.  For those who like this franchise in general, you shouldn't be disappointed.  Director Steven Quayle and his writing and visual effects team are highly creative in coming up with unusual ways to die.  FD 5 isn't really scary but there is no question tension is built as we try to guess things like when the gymnast is going to step on the metal screw on the balance beam.  I'm not sure when this series will end but the surprise at the end suggests this isn't the last of the films and not in the way you might think.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer looks terrific as you might expect with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and the DTS-HD MA (5.1) keeps the action all around.  Added features show some additional death scenes and a reconstruction of the bridge collapse and plane crash.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Accidentally I ordered this cable.  The item build seems solid.  The action on the button seems sensitive enough, but not too much so.  Unfortunately, this item does not fit my D200, and I am unable to test this item.  The item arrived promptly, and was packaged well.  Keep in mind, this is not a 10-pin remote.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|This movie is absolute garbage i will never watch it ever again total waste of time.  Have a nice day everyone
B002NZK5RI|1.0|The meaning of \\"keep case packaging\\" is that there are English subtitles and you cannot get ride of them to watch the movie.  What a bummer...and what a waste of time and money.  Had I known this I would have never ordered it.  It's also unfortunate because I have seen this movie before and it one of my favorite psychological thrillers.  Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver and other actors are excellent.  If you like real thrillers...this movie is fantastic.
1451627289|2.0|I haven't read Stephen King in 25 years so I'm not a loyal fan. I bought this book because of the premise of changing the past through a rabbit hole in time and I respect the longevtivity of Stephen King's career - maybe I've missed something. The story unfolds well as Jake learns about changing the past and begins to influence events.  However the detailed account of the characters day-by-day waiting for significant events to occur before the assassination attempt was laborious reading.  Such detail did in fact allow me to understand how the main character felt biding time as the days grind by waiting....  I too had to grind through much of the midsection. I liked the ending when alternate/unexpected outcomes came to fruition.  I was expecting some personal growth or insight regarding the Kennedy assassination or even time travel, however I was just happy to be done by the end.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Nikon replacement rear cap.  Seems exactly like the ones from the factory.  This is a very good item to order a few of.  They aren't expensive, and if you need one it could cost you greatly.  Do not pass this item by.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|This movie is awful.  Dont buy it, Dont watch it, better stuff on netflix for much cheaper.  I'd rather watch paint dry then see this again.
0553801473|2.0|I could almost tolerate the 4th and 5th books in the series if it wasn't for the fact that the timing skips around between them and some thing you know from the 4th book are not \\"known\\"  in chapters of the 5th.<br /><br />Drowning in detail and with no apparent progress, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />The height of it was reading about Jon and Samwell debating about leaving the wall in the 5th book when he is already in oldtown at the end of the fourth.  Cmon, get real.  Time in a book should be linear (at least approximately) and you should not have to read redundant material that means nothing in the larger scheme of things.<br /><br />Really wierd.
B001CTUI82|4.0|One of the most unknown groups here in the USA, Within Tempation really rock!! Coupled with a huge orchestra gives this a huge presence.,
B000LPS3B2|5.0|I saw this bootleg a few years ago, and always kept an eye out for it.  Having already seen it for free, I felt compelled to pay for it; I wasn't disappointed watching it a second time.  I rated this movie 5 stars, because there wasn't any higher rating.  This makes the American version look like a bunch of kids that found their parents' cam-corder.  This doesn't have the same \\"killer jumping through the shower curtain\\" cheesey horror as its American counter-part, but the subtle ambience of \\"something off\\" has much more of a powerful effect.  What made this original great was clearly lost when they brought it state-side.  I won't go into details as for the plot; but this is one of the all time great suspense \\"horror\\" films ever created.  If you like Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween (or any of the 30 sequels), House of the Dead... ect. You will not like this film.  If you hated any of the fore-mentioned movies, you will probably love this film.  This is for someone that likes subtlety, nuance, and intellectual thrillers.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the American version: watch this one first.  I made the mistake of watching the American version (Not knowing of the original's existence), and was disappointed.  If I could go back and watch the original first, the apex of this version would have been so much more entertaining.  But I watched them in the wrong order.  If I could only go back... then again: if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love it! I was looking for something like cut the rope or where's my water, a puzzle game that would keep me interested. I definitely found it, each level adds a new twist that makes it a little harder, very fun to play.
B0078YX1XO|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the best episode so far in season eight.  Well written with unexpected twists and turns, incredibly well acted and excellent cinematography (although still too dark).  Jesse Spencer, (Dr. Chase) really is showing his acting talent in this episode - in prior seasons he came across as more the \\"hunk actor\\" with limited range, while in this episode he shows that he truly is a talented and versatile actor and is well suited to be a top star.  Julie Mond was a great selection for the role of Moira and would have made an excellent addition as a recurring character.  Voice recording is still a little weak, but pacing is much, much better - the slower, non-hectic pacing suits this series much better than psychotic pacing.  Overall, very well done.
B00004YZ36|5.0|For a long time, I've wanted a complete set of the Mozart piano concertos and took a chance on what, to an American listener, might be a lesser-known artist and ensemble - Geza Anda and the Salzburg Mozarteum Camerata Academica. I not only have been delighted with my choice but am finding that repeated listening only increases my appreciation for the sensitive and fine performances by Anda and the Camerata. I particularly like the brightness and presence of the orchestral which is likely more characteristic of the immediacy of Mozart's venues. Anda's tempos and phrasing are superlative.  All in all, this is a great buy!
B006OAB3ME|4.0|While taking the time last Saturday night to listen to Paul's take on the Great American Songbook, news of Whitney's death flashed on my computer screen between 7 and 8 p.m.  Although stunned, I continued to listen to Paul's new album, at the same time reflecting on the highlights of Whitney's career.<br /><br />Whitney had it all, and the world knew it, so the expectations were high, elevating her to a superhuman status which, especially at the age of 48, she could no longer fulfill.  Some of the video of her recent Australian tour is painful to watch, as it documents an embarrassing performance, then shows irate ex-worshippers demanding their money.  Now the blame is being spread all around, most of it incriminating exploitive producers, insensitive admirers and unloving associates while giving the commentators their own moment of fame thanks to an association--however distant--with the voice that could upstage even a Super Bowl.  Unfortunately, no one--not even her music-savvy mother--seemed to have a necessary discussion with her about the the relation between the human voice and aging--or about repertory choices and the enduring memory of the interpreter who sings \\"classic\\" songs composed by the likes of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, George Gershwin.  Billy Holiday's voice was reduced to a \\"croak\\" in her final days.  Yet she could keep on performing because what the voice lacked was compensated for by the enduring poetry of the material--e.g. the immortal melodies and words of a Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer.  Even Billie's recordings from the 1930s are capable of producing new discoveries with each replaying.  Whitney will, like a Michael Jordan, remain in memory for her accomplishments and her remarkable instrument, along with legendary status as a female recording artist.  But her musical legacy is conspicuously short of a song repertory of distinction, or of songs that \\"tell a story.\\" At least the musician who elects to go with material of wit and sadness, story and substance has a good chance of sounding just as fresh and inviting 70 years from today.  We can remember Holiday and Sinatra, but we can also continue to enjoy them.<br /><br />Not that Paul's \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" is an album for the ages.  His interpretations are pitch-perfect, diction-pure, bright, light and bouncy.  But all you need do is compare Paul's version of the album's title song with Sinatra's (\\"Gonna Write Myself a Letter,\\" from \\"Sinatra/Basie,\\" Reprise 1961) to discover which one gets under your skin, awakens an adult interest in adult bottoms, has power and a breath-stream capable of carrying the Count Basie band instead of vice versa.  Paul may have Diana Krall's Trio as his back-up group, but it's Sinatra's version of every one of these up-tempo songs that \\"swings!\\"  As for the ballads--the wrist-slashers, or \\"suicide songs\\" as Ole Blue called them--Paul sings them innocently and politely; Sinatra sings them with the unflinching death-stare of a actor playing Hamlet, wringing from a chestnut like \\"Always\\" a whole plate-full of complex emotions, ranging from the sincerity of his love to realization of the impossibility of exceeding finite limitations: \\"I'll be loving you always\\" is neither an exhibitionistic show of vocal athleticism on the words \\"I\\" and \\"you\\" nor, in the immortal Berlin version (\\"Always\\"), is it merely a nice-sounding sentiment; rather, it's the anguished testimony of someone who will do his best to keep the emotional fire alive for as long as he possibly can.  It's the love song of an individual whom Dylan Thomas characterizes as being incapable of \\"going gently into that good night.\\"<br /><br />But this is Paul's first extended attempt at an album of standards.  If he does another, we can hope that he won't sing \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" like an earnest English choir boy or reconsider doing the tune altogether.  Every \\"crossover\\" artist these days is doing \\"My One and Only Love,\\" primarily because of the influence of the Coltrane-Johnny Hartman album.  McCartney acquits himself well on this difficult song as well as on two other tunes that are becoming increasingly  commonplace on albums by singers outside of jazz: Mercer's \\"Accentuate the Positive\\" and Arlen's \\"It's Only a Paper Moon.\\"  But the American Songbook offers so many other choices (\\"We Three\\" and \\"Home\\" barely qualify as legitimate entries--both are \\"safe\\" songs that demand little of the performer--it was Louis' thrilling cadenza that made his 1931 version of \\"Home\\" a classic, and \\"We Three\\" was a '40s Sinatra hit the Ole Blue chose not to revisit).  Paul would do well to explore the music of Sinatra--the consummate, master story-teller of ballads and swing numbers.  But he would best be advised to avoid the third Sinatra--the surprisingly strong, almost operatic voice we hear on the newly remastered \\"The Concert Sinatra.\\"  That's Whitney's territory (if only she had been encouraged to claim it).<br /><br />[For McCartney fans who are disappointed this review is insufficiently ecstatic about the current, mega-hyped album (with-ongoing-promos-that-have-gone-viral) as an alternative to my meager effort I recommend the following: [...]<br />Also, Merle Haggard's interview about making his cross-over album into Crosby-Sinatra-Ella territory is highly recommended..

Having this said, please consider this news before buying.  Again, I am not discouraging people to buy this product.  It's your money, your decision.  I would just like to inform you of this news and how this may affect the value of this item or if they are going to have a collector's four-pack.  Only time will tell I guess.  As for the one-star rating, it is because IMO, this item may not have a good collector's value knowing there is a going to be a part four.
B003I55BIA|5.0|On the first day of school in Chemistry, Alex and Brittany look at each other through the eyes of prejudice and stereotype. As the year progresses, they slowly start peeling away the layers of their public persona and begin to see the true person underneath. Mixing their two worlds seemed insurmountable but their strength, determination, and faith in each other overcame the odds.<br /><br />Awesome book! I cried. I laughed! (the bathroom scene during the wedding had me laughing so hard I was crying) I felt sorrow, pain, and rejection. I was delighted and proud. This book had it all. I would definitely recommend it!
B005F6NA5G|4.0|O.K., so \\"Down Beat\\" overdid it, not only greeting this album with a cover story on George Benson but proclaiming it the former superstar's return to mainstream jazz.  But after seeing all the coverage the jazz magazine continually gives to Metheny, Scofield, and Frisell, it's high time that a few flowers were thrown the way of an undeniable living giant, one who, moreover, is potentially Wes' most authentic successor.  Moreover, \\"Down Beat\\" has done far worse in its choice of featured artists (recalling cover stories on Johnny Mathis and Nora Jones).  In the interview, George is strangely general, almost evasive when it comes to personal questions, carrying his guitar throughout and always ready to preoccupy the writer with some of his nifty solo work.<br /><br />The listener will hear plenty of Benson's guitar on the current album, with the surprising opener, \\"Tenderly\\"--a ballad chestnut that first Art Tatum and next Oscar Peterson used to announce their credentials--serving as a similar statement by the artist on the present album. \\"Danny Boy\\" is another stunner, with the guitarist doing some re-tuning before launching one of the more harmonically ambitious interpretations of the song.<br /><br />Admittedly, there's some disappointment.  After 1976's \\"Breezin',\\" George became a pop superstar, better known for his vocals than his instrumental wizardry (some of us remember Benny Goodman's late, rare look of surprise and delight after George practically channeled Charlie Christian on a PBS show of jazz all-stars).  Since the mid-70s he's always kept the guitar close at hand, using it more frequently than Nat Cole who, for all practical purposes, left his poll-wining jazz piano behind him for good, content to remain a wealthy stand-up singer, rivaling perhaps even Sinatra (but not without groaners like \\"Hazy, Lazy Days of Summer\\").  On the present album the focus on Benson's mastery of his instrument is enough to make it \\"primarily\\" a guitar date, even if the ratio of instrument to voice is 60/40.<br /><br />\\"My Cherie Amour\\" is done with the usual Benson shine and polish (his voice is remarkably close to Stevie's, possibly better), but it's too much like his smooth jazz, mostly pop recordings of the last 30 years to be a good fit in this program.  Some listeners may have a similar dismissive reaction to \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" but George's favoring of Beatles' material is hardly unique: prior to him Grant Green showed that many Beatles tunes could be transformed into solid mainstream jazz.  Although Benson's instrumental work on the early Beatles' classic is more impressive than Green's, the latter's version, recorded by Van Gelder for Blue Note Records, is the more valuable, partially because of the inclusion of the unfailingly soulful tenor saxophone of Hank Mobley.<br /><br />Speaking of which, George pays his respects to Coltrane, the critics' choice as the only saxophonist to approach the artistry and influence of Charlie Parker in jazz history.  First, he gives us yet another version of \\"My One and Only Love,\\" which received a vibrant seccond life thanks to the now-classic John Coltrane-Johnny Hartman recording.  And he follows that up with Trane's most beloved ballad, \\"Naima.\\"<br /><br />If you're one of those listeners who believes George Benson is the best thing that's happened to the guitar since Wes Montgomery, this album is, at the very least, a cheering offering, a reassuring step back to the roots, even back to the early-to-mid-career Wes, before he too succumbed to the commercial seduction of producer Clive Davis (or was it Creed Taylor?) Either way, both are examples of musical panderers who lower music to the level of a commodity). The result: Wes began to release tunes like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" each timed to fit on a single.  Unlike predecessors such as Nat and Wes, George appears to have taken care of his health.  He's now 70 and is possibly becoming a bit more realistic about the kind of music that will keep him in the public eye (even if a smaller, more \\"select\\" group of listener-fans).  By contrast, Herbie Hancock, who is older than Benson, still seems to think he can attract arena-sized crowds by strutting the stage with his strap-on keyboard while performing \\"Watermelon Man\\" and \\"Chameleon.\\"<br /><br />Let's hope that George's coming of age continues, as evidenced by both his programming and playing.  How about an album that's 100% instrumentals?  To some of us, George, while hardly ever short of \\"flawless,\\" has played way beneath his abilities for the past 3 decades--which is not to take anything away from his vocal talent, responsible for headspinning vocalese like \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" and bonafide classics like \\"Everything Must Change.\\"  The latter tune, especially, is one that all of us would do well to listen to--more often, more attentively and more seriously.d of music that will keep him in the public eye (even if a smaller, more \\"select\\" group of listener-fans).

1609611543|5.0|In just 3 weeks since buying Wheat Belly and going wheat free that same day, I've lost 15 pounds, my heartburn's gone and so is my belief that I'd need a bilateral hip replacement within 5 years--the latter, completely unexpected.  Even on short walks my hips used to ache deeply, forcing me to stop and stretch, allowing the pain to recede.  It was an agonizing pain and Ibuprofen was a standard preventative remedy before walks or playing golf or virtually any physical activity.  Perhaps the loss of pain in my hips has been the result of my effortless loss of 15 pounds, but Dr. Davis exposes other facts in his book that blame wheat as causative for joint pain, and I believe he's right.  Eliminating wheat has proved to be the easiest wheat-loss plan my wife and I have ever undertaken.  I'm losing weight, she's losing weight and after giving birth to 3 children, she's always struggled with weight loss.  Now we're eating like kings and I've never enjoyed food so much, yet I don't feel compelled to eat 19 times a day because I don't suffer the glycemic driven eating cycle.  That ended about 30 hours after dropping wheat from our diet. We're FREE and don't miss wheat even a little.  So free in fact that I've given the book away twice now and I want to give a copy and tell everyone I see who's become plus sized.  Yee gods, we even have a terminology to ameliorate the stigma of being fat.  Now people are \\"plus sized,\\" and with 40 pounds yet to lose, so am I!  But I'm losing 2-3 pounds a week so; give me 20 weeks to lose the rest--ditto my wife.

0143038419|4.0|I hate to read the negative reviews on this book, as I find the accusations that the author is \\"self-absorbed\\" to be both unfounded and misguided given the purpose of the book. This is not a book to comment on the author's views on society or on her charitable work, and it is not for her to discuss how fortunate she is in life. It is a book about Gilbert's struggle to find happiness, despite her circumstances, which is something that many people face. I think that many of the people leaving these reviews are being dishonest with themselves;can anybody truly say that they have never experienced unhappiness when, on paper, everything is great? I hope that people aren't suggesting that you should just \\"get over yourself\\" when you are in a situation that makes you unhappy. I think that this book is testimony to the fact that being financially well-off is not always the key to happiness, and I don't see anything wrong with that.  Gilbert is not suggesting that the only way to find happiness is to set off on a year-long trek around the world, and she recognizes that she is fortunate to have that option available. But I think the point of this book is to emphasize the need to do things for yourself sometimes, and to make yourself happy. I certainly don't have the means to travel around the world, or even to take time off work, but I read the book and was inspired to take up painting, start writing, and bake more. I've read this book several times, always when I'm going through a rough patch, and it is consistently uplifting. It's a shame that people write off this book because of Gilbert's supposed \\"self-absorption\\" without recognizing the underlying message of this book; it is important to make your own happiness a priority in your life, by whatever means you can.  If you can't accept that somebody in Gilbert's circumstances could be unhappy, don't read this book. I did only give the book 4 stars because Gilbert did willfully ignore much of the culture in the countries she visited. Still, if you are willing to read about her experiences and try to find things in your life that bring you happiness, I think you'll really enjoy Eat Pray Love. Gilbert is a beautiful writer, the book has a great message of self-empowerment, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a little inspiration in their own life.
0525478817|5.0|I think I'm in love--with Augustus Waters, Hazel Grace, and  . . . John Green. Compelling, accessible yet not afraid to take on a subject like teens dying of cancer without sentimentality or cheap ploys for sympathy, The Fault in Our Stars is incredibly funny and many-tissues sad, but it never wallows. As a cancer survivor, it felt refreshingly honest and (I would say dead-on, but that sounds like a pun in really poor taste), but I think it would have been just as meaningful if I didn't unfortunately have first-person knowledge of what he's talking about. He's created such wonderful characters and a story of that first and perhaps only true love (including even the love of that very favorite book when you're a teen). Even though I'm a \\"grown-up\\" I now plan to read all of his books--what a great discovery.

B006ISJQ26|4.0|Though it has its issues, LONDON BOULEVARD is a pretty good gangster movie, which seems to draw some of its inspiration from films like CARLITO'S WAY and even SUNSET BOULEVARD.<br /><br />Fresh out of a British prison after spending three years on an assault charge, tough guy Colin Farrell is determined to go straight, even though his best buddy (Ben Chaplin) and his brutal, ultra-violent boss (Ray Winstone) are determined to bring him back into the rackets by fair means or foul.<br /><br />Farrell gets a job working for reclusive movie actress Keira Knightley, who is constantly being stalked by paparazzi stationed outside of her house.  A romantic relationship develops between them, and they even make plans to escape London forever.  Unfortunately, the spurned Winstone is not about to let that happen.<br /><br />William Monahan (THE DEPARTED) both wrote and makes his directing debut with LONDON BOULEVARD, which moves along at a fairly nice clip and never really loses our interest.  The cast is uniformly excellent.<br /><br />The primary problem that I have with this picture is one that is shared with many of today's British movies, and that's its language.<br /><br />Years ago, when actors like Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave or Trevor Howard were making films, you could hear and understand every word they said on screen.  Today, performers akin to the very talented and charismatic Colin Farrell often mumble their lines or speak in an accent and/or with slang that is difficult to understand.  You may be able to generally comprehend what is happening on screen, but the subtleties escape you.<br /><br />There are also a couple of unexplained \\"holes\\" in the story, like: Who was the paparazzi in the olive green jacket and what was his purpose?<br /><br />On the other hand, perhaps that was explained in the dialogue that I didn't understand.<br /><br />Next time I watch this movie, I think I'll turn on the subtitles.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

B0071T5PN0|5.0|It's been nearly 14 years after Van Halen's last full length album, and 28 years since a full album with Diamond Dave.  So after so long, how is it?  In a word, amazing!  First, let's get this out of the way.  This is one of their heavier albums, if not the heaviest they've ever done (it is in my opinion).  Listening to Tattoo when it first came out, I was a bit curious.  I didn't pay any attention to the criticism, I mean come on, Dance the Night Away was the first single off of their second album, and it wasn't exactly a hard song either, yet the second album is still pretty amazing.  That, and I think Tattoo fits right along with any of their older songs.  Secondly, these guys (with the exception of Wolfie) are in their 50s.  Not exactly what I'd call old like everyone else has been, but still.  Even with this in mind, the energy and feeling off of this album is awesome.  Like I said, it's probably the heaviest album they've ever made.  Dave is a little rough, but considering his style of singing, he more than holds up, and he still more than has the attitude and the energy.  Alex...Those drums.  He's always had a very distinctive way of drumming, and it really stands out on this, especially on \\"As Is\\".  Wolfie, Eddie's son is more than a replacement for Michael Anthony, in fact I'd say he bring his own incredible style to the table...Doesn't hurt that the bass is quite a bit higher in the mix, but still, I love how he sounds on this.  Eddie.  He sounds absolutely amazing on this, playing with more fury and energy than we've probably ever heard him play.  In fact, the solo on \\"As Is\\" is probably my second favorite solo by him, the first being \\"You're No Good\\".  So what am I about to whine about?  The overall sound.  Don't get me wrong, it's amazing, it's heavy, and it's really energetic.  But compared to their earlier efforts, it's much darker.  I love the way he sounds still, though, it's just a bit different.  On the same note, I read somewhere that Dave said this was a completely new band compared to what came before.  With that said, I'd actually say it sounds fresh and modern (I still think the majority of their stuff with Dave before holds up really well today).  That and it all still sounds better than most of the other stuff coming out these days.  Anyways, long live the new Van Halen!  I'm really hoping this turns out big!  Seeing them live soon, can't wait!
0385344228|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the first page.  It was complete with very well developed, likeable characters and suspense.  Did Jacob murder his classmate, or didn't he?  The behavior profile starts to add up as the book goes along.  The struggles of a family that have been \\"accused\\" are played out in daily fashion focusing strongly on the emotional toll it begins to take.  The conflicts that the Mom goes through in wondering if her son did it, or didn't, and the oppposing views of both parents really played well into this story.  The story is told from the Fathers point of view, and jumps between court testimony that is written in a different format, and the continuing story.  I couldn't put this down, and spent a lazy Sunday finishing it off.  I was dying to know how it was going to end.  I didn't predict the ending, however, I did have some idea of how it might go, but I was surprised at how it actually played out.<br /><br />If you are looking for a suspenseful page turner centered strongly around the court scene and a quick yet detailed read that is entertaining, than this is the book for you.  I would recommend it to my friends and family.
0811821846|4.0|I have tried a few of the reciepies in this book and the results have been mostly delicious. although the \\"wookie cookies\\" are slightly hairy -at first- with a delightful flavor over all, and a rich after taste.  Have plenty of milk handy to wash them down.  Some of the ingredients are difficult to find, but if you use the force and find a smuggler with a fast ship you should be able to procure the ingredients you are looking for.  Also in the book are the tuantaun wan tons. I encourage you to try these. they are amazing if you can get past the smell. I made some for my girlfriend/sister and she loved them!  It is worth noting that when I tried the Yoda yogurt it seemed stale, but that may have been my fault so don't let it stop you.  This book is great and a must have for any kitchen. It is roughly the size of a small thermal exhaust port and fits neatly in both a kitchen cupboard or a bookshelf. You can't go wrong (unless you give in to your anger)  Eat or do not eat, but you must buy.

I can't say much more than has already been said, but this book is downright scary, much better than the movie (which I loved, btw), and an all around fantastic descent into the mouth of madness.  King never fails to disappoint.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Just picked this up for free app of the day, and very happy I did! Works beautifully on Kindle Fire, game play is very smooth and graphics are beautiful. If you have issues using fingers, I'd suggest a stylus ( which btw the way, if you don't have one.. get one. it makes the kindle touchscreen so much easier to use) That being said, children and adult alike will enjoy this neat little game. Starts out real easy for you to get the hang of and gets more challenging as you work through the levels. ( just spent 45 minutes on one I couldn't figure out lol)  Thanks for offering such a great game Amazon! I really hope to see more really good ones for download so I can enjoy more on my Kindle.

B000L53D4O|1.0|I purchased this in part because I was looking for items made in America. The search criteria was \\"made in America toys\\", and this walker was displayed in that section.

This is not something I want to give my great-granddaughter, and I feel I have been lied to and conned. In addition, if the child attempts to manipulate the moving parts this must be done from in front - & if the walker has not been folded down by an adult it will likely roll out of the toddler's grasp & lad the child on his/her face. Not as represented, and not safe.

0446573019|1.0|Having read Lee Child's \\"The Affair\\", I felt that I was reading a replay, until the end. Then, my real disappointment arrived - the \\"terrorist villains\\" turned out to be two former Marines, one who had been in combat and was now a Homeland Security agent. With all of the terrorism organizations and criminal cartels in the world today, one would think that there were ample bad guys available to people plots. Mr. Baldacci needs to visit the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico, the Iowa Jima Monument and the Viet Nam Memorial to get an idea of what United States Marines in particular and the US Armed Froces in general have contributed to this country. As a former Marine Sergeant and Viet Nam Vet, and I can now state that I am a former fan of Mr. Baldacci's offerings.  Mr. Baldacci certainly owes an apology to all service personnel, especially Marines, who have made so many sacrifices so that he has the right of free speech to malign us all.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I read several reviews on this microphone and compared to other models before purchasing, and I was STILL hesitant to purchase this microphone.  I got it and used it for several interviews, and informational video spots and the audio quality is very good. It gets rid of any background noise you would have while recording (worked great in a warehouse setting) and the audio comes in clean on both channels.  I accidentally left the microphone \\"on\\" for 24 hours, and still had battery life in it to shoot for 3 hours of video.  Maybe the poor reviews came from a defective product, but I would recommend this microphone to anyone.  Length of the chord is great to have, I would only wish it came with a case or something for travel.  This is being used with a Kodak Zi8.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey and thought season 2 was even better than season 1.  One reviewer mentioned that this special UK DVD does not have the Christmas sepcial, but I got this DVD, and it does have it.  The DVD case/cover did not mention that the Christmas special was included (as far as I could see), but it was included, and I found it on disc 3 and was very happily suprprised.

1466401885|5.0|Wow! When I picked up this book yesterday morning, I only meant to read a chapter or two, but 8 hours later I had completely devoured it and let me tell you - Beautiful Disaster is such an addictive read that I couldn't help  love  it.  When Abby Abernathy starts Eastern University she is trying to put her past behind her, so meeting Travis Maddox; the ultimate bad boy - who fights for fun, drinks, smokes and has the worst reputation, she's kind of thrown because he definitely wasn't in her plans. When Travis notices Abby, she's quick to prove that she won't be used like any of his other girls. Instead she suggests they become friend and quickly Travis finds a way for Abby to be in his life for longer than they originally planned. What Abby doesn't realise is that, she's about to find her match in Travis but how can she be with someone who reminds her of all the things she's trying to leave behind?  Firstly, I NEED A TRAVIS! And secondly, this book is so awesome. From the first page I was sucked into a compelling and heart-pounding story and I wasn't released until the very last page and I have to say, I was so disappointed when I finished. Jamie Maguire knows how to write an amazing contemporary romance novel and has really ticked all the right boxes for me. Epic win!  Now, you know I've got to talk about the characters and honestly, they really could compete with Simone Elkeles Perfect Chemistry characters, if anything I like them more.  Abby is a sweet, innocent girl but one that stands up for herself and she really cares what people think about her. When she meets Travis, she knows being friends with him can only be just that and it does take her a while to realise her feelings for him and at that point, she's just too stubborn to admit it. She wants to do the right thing and be with the right guy and honestly she doesn't think Travis can be that for her. But as much as I like Abby, she is a frustrating character. Her stubbornness really gets in her way and clouds her mind. There are so many times that I really wanted to grab her and shake her, but she does redeem herself.  Now Travis he's the ultimate bad boy. Not only does he fight for money, he drinks far too much and he uses girls for sex. He's very rash, stubborn and unpredictable but he's also very loveable and such a sweet guy. Meeting Abby really turns his life around. He changes for her and he becomes the best friend anyone could ever be but once his true feelings start showing, he can't control them and soon the sparks start flying. I really wanted to hate him in parts because he does so many jaw-dropping stupid things, but deep down I couldn't. One thing about him which I had to question was, his temper - he gets so angry sometimes and his feelings for Abby really makes him crazy but again like Abby, he redeems himself. And the fact that he has so many swoon-worthy quotes that seriously makes you melt.  And yes Travis Maddox is top on my book boyfriend list. How could he not be?  ;) And the epilogue is just P.E.R.F.E.C.T!  All in all, Beautiful Disaster is a beautiful and touching story about two people that are so wrong for each other, but deep down, they are so right for each other. An absolute amazing read and one I highly recommend.
0062082353|5.0|Book gives you the inside scoop of how this man became a true American hero ( at least in my mind). Read about the trials and tribulations you must endure during the training and perserverence to stay alive and succeed in your missions.
0596007124|5.0|I haven't purchased many 'Head First' books yet but this one has convinced me to take a closer look at them.  I used this book as a quick run-through of designs before I dug deeper with the GOF (Gang of four) Design Patterns book.  It's clear and easy to follow.  You get the most out of them by pairing the two books together.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|it confuses me I don't get what to do or the point but the picture on the front scares me! hehehshe

B004EPZ070|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and my genre's are generally scifi or horror. I saw nothing predictable about this film.  I also saw nothing wrong with the dialogue.  I thought they acted naturally and what they had to say set the stage for the characterization of the individuals. I don't see why it was labeled a chick flick.  There were a lot of males in the movie as well and if the fact that it is a romantic story makes it for females doesn't say much for men. I know many men who would watch this movie, but they are over 30.  I was actually surprised when Ginnifer's character ended up with the one she wanted. She had let her best friend who was flashy, take the guy she wanted away. She wouldn't stand up for herself.  There are a lot of people like this and I can say the movie was pretty realistic over all in portraying real life situations because I have been there and I know others who have as well. Not quite the same scenario but similar. The ending in the credits is the only thing that threw me off. It's charming and I would recommend the movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie with a happy ending and a lot of laughs.
0201633612|5.0|I purchased this book as a suggestion while taking a UML and Object Orientation design class.  It's amazing how well this book has aged.  This book goes in depth with core design patterns that every programmer should be exposed to.  I think it's best to pair this book with a 'thinking in objects' book as the two kind of go hand-in-hand.  Many of these patterns can be derived just by following good OO design.  Also, I actually purchased a lighter Design Patterns book to get a quick feel for the designs before I dug deeper using this book.

0718157834|5.0|I have bought many, many books from amazon but never written a review.  I couldn't not write a review of this book.  It is funny, quirky, endearing, sad and incredibly moving.  A book that changed my outlook on the world.  I am impressed at the authors ability to make such loveable, real characters and the way she told this story.
0765365278|4.0|There have been so many reviews written that mine probably won't lend any more to what have been said.  It is a long book but it is worth ready. Mr. Sanderson has a wonderful way to taking you to another world.  It is so unique and the characters are well cratfted.  Instead of just saying Shallan is a fast and intelligent young lady, he actually showed it through her dialogues with Jashnah.  That's why this book is as long as it is.  It has many layers and each layer is reviewed slowly but the end is quite fantastic.  Like many others, I found it is difficult to switch from one character line to another.  I wish I discovered this book after the next was written.
B006UG90RM|5.0|At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how someone is going to judge the album musically one way or another, in my opinion. What matters however is the amount of trials and hardships this band has faced and overcome over the years and the legacy that they've left behind. They're a true inspiration for countless people all over the world.  Therefore, whatever tunes they came up with on their new record are just a testament to the fact that they're still with it the best they can, despite difficulties and problems. Having it be a solid hard rock Van (Roth) Halen album fills in all the gaps. Way to go on an excellent record, gentlemen!  -Starazzio
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's a lot of fun trying to bag everything just right. It really is like the grocery store version of tetris.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I don't like zombie pictures. AMC had a marathon in January and I watched to see what the hype was about. I really enjoyed the show. It wasn't just your run of the mill mindless zombie show. It had a plot with characters you could like and wanted to follow. The show is intelligent and well produced. It does for zombies what \\"Twlight\\" did for vampires, but The Walking Dead\\" is much scarier. It's so realistic it makes you wonder could it really happen. Great show for teens and adults.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This is a fantastic compilation. Love the upbeat faster paced songs which all definitely sound like Coldplay with their melodius touches. Received the disc today and have it on repeat. Have yet to find a song that disappoints. Can't wait to see them in concert this summer!!!!! Yes! Yes! Yes!
B000OLRM2O|5.0|Used with my High School Students for Black History month with lots of support materials and activities and real footage from fights and times.  They loved it. I loved it.  They actually clapped and cheered when we finished the movie.  There is a lot to talk about and discuss.  Also celebrated Ali's 70th Birthday.  Good Luck!
B003Y5HWJU|1.0|This show seemed to prove me wrong from the get go. Cast is slow moving and the show is very bland and very boring. I couldn't seem to finish watching the first season...nor did i want to. If it started upbeat and interesting, I would have continued watching. Wouldn't recommend on purchasing this. The cover and advertising were all the best parts!
B006UG90RM|1.0|Looking at the reviews online you would think this album is really going to be a blockbuster.  Seems a lot of die hard fans came out to support this album, but in reality it's a dud.  The singles are B sides, outtakes, redone and reprocessed for 2012!  Many of the other new songs are Eddie Van Halen clunkers that remind me much of the bad songs from Van Halen III.  Where are the catchy hooks, and the great harmonies that made the great VH hits?  And Dave's vocal delivery is quite different this time, seems like they gave him leeway to do about whatever he wanted.  It comes across as rugged to me, like unfinished vocals or alternative takes.  I dont like the way he's singing here, unrestrained!<br /><br />As far as the sales are concerned, they are terrible!  185,000 in the first week including downloads, LESS than Van Halen III which sold 191,000 in 1998!  To make it worse, A Different Kind Of truth has taken a huge five in week 2 all the way down to #8 and around 20,000 copies.  I don't think this one is even going to make Gold!  A great new Van Halen CD would have made Gold, and Platinum with ease!

014241543X|5.0|If I Stay is a powerful young-adult novel written by Gayle Forman. 17 year old Mia is a budding musician with a seemingly perfect life with two parents, a crazy little brother, a loyal best friend, and a perfect rocker boyfriend, but in a freak accident on a snowy day, her life is forever changed. The once-important things in life no longer matter to her. Forman starts off the story by making you fall in love with all the main characters: Mia's family and boyfriend Adam. Then she hooks your attention with a heartbreaking twist of events. The rest of the novel is told by Mia watching everyone come visit her and reliving memories of her with her family, boyfriend, and best friend.  The main part of the novel deals with Mia trying to survive, and her grandparents, best friend, and boyfriend dealing with the fact that Mia never come back. This part is very bittersweet and makes you empathize with the characters losing a loved one.  I loved that Forman incorporated music throughout If I Stay, and the fact that Adam, Mia, and her parents are musicians makes it all the better. I also love how Adam and Mia are opposites that attract. It's an unexpected romance that makes you smile. The lengths that Mia's family goes to see her also warm your heart, and remind you to treasure the important things in life. I enjoyed the view point from which the story is told. It's unique and adds a special touch to the story.  Overall, I would definitely recommend If I Stay. It's a well-written novel with characters you're bound to love. Though the story might seem sad, there are plenty of funny parts carefully woven into the plot. If I Stay is a touching and moving book that makes you take a step back from life, take a look around, and realize what's worth fighting for.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|As many reviewers have pointed out, much of Terrence Malick's \\"The Tree of Life\\" plays out as an apparent homage to Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\".  It uses similar sweeping visuals of the cosmos and the earthen landscape, a similar narrative structure, similar use of classical music.  Kubrick's opening showed us the dawn of man; Malick's opening shows us the evolution of life, leading us to the central story about a young family in the 1950's.  It is here that Malick's attempt to replicate Kubrick's masterpiece quickly begins to fall apart.  When Bowman, Poole, and the HAL 9000 set off aboard the Discovery One in Kubrick's film, they were going - to borrow from \\"Star Trek\\" - where no man had gone before.  When \\"Tree of Life\\" takes us inside the lives of a borderline dysfunctional family, we are traveling over very familiar territory.  Consequently, Malick's attempt to tell his story on such a grand scale seems awkward and forced.  His canvas here is simply too big.  And there are other problems.  The jumpy hand-held cinematography, fine for music videos or other short subjects, is - over a running time of well over two hours - exhausting to the viewer.  The sparse dialogue and hushed monotones, used in \\"2001\\" to convey the fear and loneliness of traveling in space, seem to have no real purpose in Malick's film other than to perhaps suggest the disconnection that these family members have to each other.  In the end, what \\"The Tree of Life\\" does is attempt to show us the human family - all of its joys, struggles, loves, losses and regrets - through the widest possible lens and as an answer, I suppose, for the meaning of life.  It is a film that ultimately fails by trying to model itself after a science fiction masterpiece rather than choosing a simpler and more user-friendly approach.

0321687299|3.0|As far as HTML5 goes, there really aren't a lot of good and comprehensive references to the markup specifications yet. This book serves as a good reference to the new markup tags and offers examples of how each can be used. If you're already working with HTML and are looking for a quick read through of the new tags and their purposes this is the book for you.  However, it does not serve as a beginners guide to HTML. The book assumes that you're already familiar with coding in HTML and makes no attempt to teach you the basics. I don't count this as a fault against the book, but I do think it needs to be said.  The authors also spend quite a bit of time talking about accessibility features (working with screenreaders and so forth). It's a good topic and worthy of a book by itself, but the amount of time they devote to it in this book seems disproportional. I'd offer the authors my advice of toning down that topic in this book and devoting another book to it instead.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Today is Valentine's Day and this app is the free app of the day. It is an excellent game that does involve Tetris skills and patience that is needed for Angry Birds to get all three stars. This game is unique and the groceries have personalities that make this game childish but in a good way like a good cartoon. I love this game!
B006PHD0RW|1.0|I downloaded and installed this Free App of the Day on my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 tablet.  But I can't get Bag It! to open.  When I click on the app, I get a black screen with the title at the top for a few seconds, then it just closes. I don't have a problem opening any of my other Amazon Appstore apps, just this one.  Too bad, because this sounds like a good game by reading other reviews.

I looked at a couple of other discs and they are scratched too. I have already started reading this with my class and do not have time to return it. I'm very disappointed.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This film brings together a really important story that is worth telling, some first rate actors and great direction.  Al Pacino and Russell Crowe bring to the screen the true life moral dilemmas that faced Wigand and Bergman as they faced the enormous pressures of both corporate tobacco and CBS.  Pacino and Crowe give excellent performances and they are a good duo, due to their opposite natures.  These are men who probably would never have met in life if it had not been for the dilemma that drew them together. Pacino, as Bergman, is a scruffy little guy for whom Crowe's leisure life on the golf course is repellent.  Crowe, who gained a lot of weight for the role, plays a Kentucky scientist, who has been living the good life on the payroll of a large tobacco company.  He's on his second wife, we later learn, a beautiful Southern belle, and they enjoy a huge home with pool, and an altogether very comfortable lifestyle.  When Wigand's conscience gets the best of him and he can no longer go along with the dangerous practices that the company is perpetrating, he is fired.  It's an interesting irony that his own daughter suffers from acute asthma -- a respiratory disease.  The problem is that he needs his medical insurance for her and the rest of the family, and this is threatened as he opts to tell what he knows to 60 minutes.  We see Wigand as he suffers excrutiating choices as the tobacco company threatens not only to cut his severance package, but it seems that his very life and those of his family are being threatened.  It's a credit to the director that the story is told just right---there's a steady buildup of tension as the price this man is forced to pay in order to do what he thinks is right escalates.  At one point his wife decides that the pressure is too much for her to bear, so she leaves, taking the kids with her.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his portrayal of this man.  I soon forgot it was Crowe and thorougly got into the mind of Wigand.  Pacino is alsocompelling as the street smart, big mouth New Yorker, who we see develops a real sense of caring for Wigand.  Yes, Wigand is a \\"commodity\\" -- Bergman (Pacino) needs him for his show, but he also comes to have a genuine affection for him.  I thought the scene on the lawn with the two of them, sort of awkwardly standing outside the party, after Wigand has given his testimony, was brilliant.  They don't come out and hug or say anything obvious...both are reserved in their own way....but the way they stand, sort of awkwardly and the looks they give each other are really moving.  Christopher Plummer is also very effective as Mike Wallace.  It must have been a challenge to portray such a well-known face and he did a very good job.  I also want to mention the music.  There were interludes of strange haunting vocals, that didn't seem to have anything logical to do with the story, but they were really effective in demonstrating the enormous pain and strain that the men were facing.  As Bergman says to Crowe...something like \\"thanks for being a hero...they are dying breed.\\"  And Wigand returns the complement.  It's really heartening to see such a display of heroism in our modern time.  There's a small added feature on the DVD which gives a few shots of the real Wigand and Bergman.  Wigand looks a lot like the way Crowe portrayed him....chunky and round-faced, but a lot more cheerful.  He's sporting a bright orange and red tie and looks very jolly.  Of course his troubles are behind him.  Bergman is shown, too, not quite a cute as Pacino, but it was still good to see him.  He's working for NPR, which got a terrible slam by the Mike Wallace character....hmmm.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a great faotd..levels get more challenging as you go and I like that there are different types of levels..not just stack the groceries but see how fast you can crush them as well..good fun!  May even help my kids to remember not to put the chips at the bottom of the bag!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my sister who had been wanting it for months now. At first I thought it looked really boring, but after playing it, I'm hooked. It's a strategy game, but not in a way that it takes hours to take your turn (like chess). I highly recommend this game.

Tough crap, you're starting from the BEGINNING of that level, sucker.<br /><br />That's B.S.

B005HSL626|5.0|this is such a cool game for the kindle fire. Ive even played it on different tablets too and its fun for all ages around I love it
B005VPRETE|5.0|First off, I am an adult woman who bought this set mainly for myself.  I have two little girls that will get to play with this when I'm done, but I get to have fun building first.<br /><br />I enjoy building just to build, and I love the colors of the bricks in this set.  There's vibrant purple, green, blue, pink and red in this set.  It was nice and easy to build, most adults could put this together just by looking at the photos.<br /><br />The mini-figures included (Olivia, Bird, Cat) are so adorable!  They lend themselves well to being highly playable for 'stories'.  The thing with other mini-figures that my girls never loved is that they don't look like my girls.  These mini-figures finally do!  The hands hold standard LEGO items, the feet fit onto standard LEGO blocks, and the hair is compatible with standard mini-figures. This really expands the options for the girls to mix and match to create the mini-figure that they feel represents them that day.<br /><br />I'm so excited that LEGO came out with a product line that really lets the rest of us indulge.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I really liked the puzzles.  Some of the levels are a little hard for a kid but the game is a lot of fun to play and kept me busy.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Throughout history, mankind has defined itself through it's achievements. First came upright walking, then fire, then the wheel and finally this album. This album not only quintessentially redefines music for an entire species, but single handedly stands out as a cultural epoch for all humanity. My only fear is that after reaching this great triumph, we will have nowhere else to go but down. I don't know how else we can top this; curing disease, human cloning, space travel; These all pale in comparison to this album. I believe that now would be a time to use nuclear arms to end our civilization now, while we have reached a previously unimaginable height. There is nothing left for us to achieve. Lets end it on a high note, as an example to the entire universe about what is possible.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Bag IT! is a very nice app with smooth graphics that keeps you engaged and entertained.  Works well on Xoom tablet.  Only problem is the ROTATION CONTROL keeps switching back and forth - hard to keep the item rotated where you Want them.  Definitely worth 5 stars if this is fixed.  Very well done app otherwise... I recommend it!

B0078JOAOI|5.0|This episode picks up right where episode 7 left you hanging, at the barn. There isn't much walker action in this episode, but I felt a lot of important things unfolded. This episode kept the suspense up and also has left me wondering about the next episode, like they all tend to have the ability to do. There are a couple of things that happened briefly, but I'm sure that they will be covered in the next or oncoming episodes. Rick steps up and shows why he is still in charge, meanwhile, Shane's instability continues to grow. If you follow the show I'm sure that you won't be disappointed with this episode either.<br /><br />This was my first time using Amazon Instant Video. I am so excited that AMC and Amazon have come together to make this show available for $1.99. I do not have cable or satellite, and this is one of very few shows that I watch. To be able to stream this and keep it in my video library is amazing and I will definitely be utilizing Amazon's Instant Video service well into the future. A big thank you to Amazon, AMC, and The Walking Dead.
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|I got the first season of Dexter on DVD for Christmas, and after having watched through the entire season in a matter of a week, it leaves me feeling very unimpressed.  What exactly is the hype over this show?  It has such an unoriginal feel to it.  The best comparison I can make is that this show is like CSI, just with an extended story arc, foul language, and the occasional sex scene.  That's it!  What is so original about that???  I honestly don't feel that someone who kills people just because they did something wrong makes for an interesting plot convention.  Boring!  The whole story arc about the ice-truck killer is also very droll.  I don't understand why his identity was revealed a few episodes before the season finale.  What kind of writing is this, Showtime?  After the season finale ended (which, by the way, was the best episode in the entire first season), the viewer is left with the feeling that the entire series is over.  Why bother doing a second season?  You should have had a cliffhanger season finale!!  Perhaps if the identity of the ice-truck killer was officially revealed in the season finale, it would have made for a much better season, and I certainly would have bought season 2.  But I digress...  Other points worth noting are the fact that the actors who played Lt. LaGuerta and Angel Battista came directly from HBO's hit series \\"Oz\\" (LaGuerta played the prison doctor, and Angel played Morales, one of the Latino inmates).  Their roles in \\"Oz\\" were (and are) superior to their characters in Dexter.  Also, one of the bonus features for this first season was missing.  Where was \\"The Academy of Blood: A Killer Course\\"?  I couldn't find it anywhere.  Another thing to note:  In one episode where Dexter was collecting one of his prized blood samples from a victim, I have an issue with the shape of the blood specimen on the slide after he smeared it.  It is NOT supposed to look like a perfect circle of blood after smearing!  I know because I'm a Pathologist's Assistant, and I deal with blood smears during fine needle aspirations every day.  They do NOT come out looking like a perfect circle of blood after you smear it with a blank slide!  Mega points off for scientific/medical inaccuracy...  Speaking of inaccuracies, take a look at the packaging of Dexter: The First Season ----  There is a glaring typo in the description for Episode 9 on Disc 3:  \\"left him his all his belongings.\\"  WHAT?!?!  How stupid can these people be to leave such a monstrous grammatical error like that out in the open?!  It's not only on the inside of the DVD case, but it's also in the description on the episode selection screen itself!!!!!  Talk about incompetence....  Overall, the end of Season 1 left me with a big feeling of emptiness and closure.  It's really a one-star first season, but I gave it another star for the season finale.  I have no interest in purchasing the rest of this series due to the slipshod writing.  Showtime, if you want a REAL excellent writer on your staff, write to me in the comments section below!  This first season was for the birds...  P.S.  Yay for my review being #600 for this item!

1451627289|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone with a mind.  Reading this book is a complete waste of time and money. This review written by Leslie's husband - David.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Ever wonder what happened in the 3 year gap between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith? With all the hate directed towards the prequel movies, maybe you shouldn't answer that one.  Having recently rewatched the prequels in their new blu-ray incarnations, I think they are judged way too harshly. The most glaring weakness of the movies, especially episodes 2&3, are that they feel rushed. For example, Anakin falls too easily. Also, Anakin and Padme fall in love too easily. Lots of plot holes and explanations of those plot holes are seemingly left for other movies that will never get made. Well, that's now not necessarily true with the arrival of The Clone Wars cartoon. The creators are allowed to take their time building up characters and plotlines that could only be done superficially in the movies, including the classic original trilogy. It makes me wistfully wonder whether there might some day be a cartoon based on Episodes 4-6. There probably will.  Season One was preceded by a full length movie, The Clone Wars, which is also available on Blu-ray, so make sure you watch that before you start the series. The main event of the movie was Anakin gaining his first and only (?) Padawan learner, the feisty but lovable Ahsoka. Most of the Jedi have become generals in the Republic Army, blissfully unaware that Chancellor Palpatine, aka Darth Sidious is orchestrating the entire Civil War with the help of Count Dooku, and HIS apprentice, Ventress, the not quite Sith assassin.  While Anakin, Obi-wan, and Ahsoka are the main characters of the series, the writers seem to view the show as more of an ensemble piece. For instance, episode 1 stars Yoda, and not the crotchety know-it-all of the prequel films. He is shown more as the laughing trickster of Empire before Luke found out his true identity. I think he only laughed once in the prequel trilogy, and that wasn't very whole hearted. Other episodes feature Jedi that looked cool in the movies but sometimes never even spoke, like Luminara, Aayla Secura, and Kit Fisto. I guess Kit did have a semi-speaking part in Revenge of the Sith. IF you could call dying screaming like a little girl speaking. Other episodes feature clone troopers and even the much maligned Jar Jar Binks as the main stars.  A lot of the episodes have 2-3 episode story arcs which are just as good as if not BETTER than any of the live action movies. I know this might sound incredible but after finishing the first season multi-part finale, I'm actually feeling like I enjoyed this TV show even more than the live action movies, EVEN the original trilogy which I completely loved. Watching the Clone Wars cartoon, the Star Wars universe just seems so much richer. You actually have time to deal with the consequences of character's actions.  One of the things that bothered me about Attack of the Clones was when Anakin went berserk and killed all those sand people. Yoda sensed his pain and that something terrible had happened. But we never did get to see whether Yoda asked him about it. Or did Obi-wan ever ask him what happened on Tatooine. Or did Yoda or the Jedi ever think for one second WHO had really ordered the clone army to be manufactured. Like was it such a good idea to just show up on Kamino and just pick them up no questions asked. I would want to know who had ordered them and what their intentions were before I armed them and let them loose on the galaxy.  While the live action movies didn't have time to ask questions like these, the cartoon does. For example, in one of the later episodes, a clone goes bad, or let's just say, he turns against the Republic. He sees the Republic and the Jedi as slavemasters, ordering him and his \\"brothers\\" to lay down their lives for no reason other than being commanded to. It really flips the tables on who is right in the Star Wars universe. One mystery that is further compounded by showing how individual the clones are is that it just seems unbelievable that they would carry out Order 66 so I hope the writers somehow figure out a way to resolve that.  All in all, I loved this first season, and already have the next two on my shelf ready and waiting.

B0018O4YT0|5.0|I bought this movie because I LOVE unique,weird sci-fi flicks. The cast was awesome and the effects were cool. The movie was an original work of art. Jennifer Connelly was(still is)hot! The idea of nobody having there own thoughts or memories is very scary to me. The idea of everyone sharing the same Dreams and thoughts without knowing it blows my mind! If you do not own this I urge you to pick it up!!! This is a classic sci-fi flick!

0545265355|5.0|GREAT product, great books, all great. Even though the reading feels a lot juvenile, it's totally worth it.  Just think the packaging could be a lot better. I got lucky the mail in Brazil did not harass the books. A box with something inside to prevent damage would be perfect.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I bought this CD only because I felt merely compelled to. As a big fan of this band for 30 years, my level of expectation has diminished with every release since \\"1984\\". Like most other reviews you will read-I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was cool enough that DLR got back with VH (I never expected that again in my lifetime). But to hear what has been laid down on this project has me in bewildered amazement. The fact of the matter is that many of the tracks were developed from songs that were tossed on the cutting room floor during their heyday-hence the classic sound. I never thought we'd as VH fans would get both Roth back in the band AND the sound of Fair Warning and Women and Children First to come completely together in 2012. I'm quite blown away. True VH fans that have spun this CD know exactly what I'm talking about!  I already have my concert tickets!!

0525478817|5.0|This is a great book! It is well written, and although it is sad it is ultimately very inspiring and thought provoking.  There are also a lot of interesting literary aspects that make it fun to read, and there are many humerous moments as well.  Also, it isn't just for teens, adults can read it and enjoy it too.

I could not put the book down once I started reading it.<br />The Author did a superb job in the way he explained the inner workings of the company and was extremely honest about Steve Jobs personality.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in months. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. My husband,  who is a \\"sometimes\\" reader, read them first and couldn't wait to start each of the next two books! That's when I knew I had to read them too! It is sometimes violent and sometimes touching. You won't be able to put it down!
B0071T5PN0|2.0|These old guys need some money so they threw this together. Couple songs are okay but it just didn't come together for this album, didn't click. I was surprised at the heaviness/newness of Honeybabysweetiedoll, that's what got them the two stars.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Have you been a victim of the music world as I have? Dealing with crappy \\"rock\\" bands singing of their angst and cookie cutter pop crap? Well no more! No more do you have to sequester yourself to the classic rock station because today's metal makes you want to cut yourself. No more do you have to settle for the mediocrity of the Nicklebox Twenty Seconds to Daughtry's of the world. Van Halen has swooped in on its winged lion and made sweet love to the face of rock music. Remember how you wanted the Guns and Roses comeback album, Chinese Democracy, to rock, and it didn't? Well, this album not only makes up for that disappointment, but also for Aerosmith since the 90s. You would be doing a disservice to yourself if you didn't buy this album. In fact, if you don't buy this album, the terrorists win.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Great looking case - get a lot of compliment. Quality is high and get a lot of compliments on the look and color.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|While I had read a number of reviews prior to purchasing the book, I didn't read the book description.  If I had, I would have known it was written for children!  I enjoyed Book 1, but by Book 2 I began to suspect this series was written for a younger audience. The lack of maturity in the character and plot development was disappointing and the book became somewhat boring.  The premise of the book is compelling and in the hands of someone like Stephen King or Dean Koontz, it would have been an excellent read for adults, as well.

B00003CXDB|4.0|Greed.  Lust.  Power.  Corruption.  Riches.  But enough about serving in Congress and the White House.  Back before dot-coms and cyber trading and Google there was Poker-faced stock trading; it is the quintessential evolutionary process.  And the intoxicating allure of power and mind-boggling wealth is brought to the forte in Oliver Stone's classic WALL STREET.  It's a trip down memory lane to go back and view this film again, with its DOS computer prompts and portable phones the size of Rhode Island.  Long before wealth and success and ambition were demonized by our culture, Stone depicts a young stockbroker's foray into lugubrious corruption and power; yet once young Bud Fox gets his first taste of blood in the water, it's not long before he's in over his head, and then the price to pay becomes daunting indeed.  And it's just as much fun to watch today as it was in 1987.<br /><br />Charlie Sheen (long before the substance abuse took its toll on his boyish looks) is marvelous as the easily-impressed, ultimately overwhelmed Fox; Bud just wants to make his father (played by real-life papa Martin) proud of him, plus make his own way in the world.  Which makes him a prime candidate for seduction by financier extraordinaire Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas was born to play this role); once Bud gets a glimpse of Gordon's world with its fabulous riches and power, he willingly does what he knows is dead wrong (not to mention illegal):  making money via insider trading.  Naturally over the course of events Bud's life unravels, and the SEC comes calling--and even Gekko himself is no longer immune to the justice coming over the horizon.  And at the risk of being redundant, it's very fun to watch.<br /><br />In addition to Douglas and the two Sheens WALL STREET sports a grand cast, including John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook, Daryl Hannah, and the wonderful Terence Stamp.  One star off due to the vapidity of the subject matter and its often simplistic manifestation, but hey, greed still takes center stage.  Nowadays we would just be concerned if Bud and Gordo would pay their fair share; after all, the corruption has now shifted to the Potomac.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.age.

B000PTYUQG|5.0|Virtually evey Stravinsky opus, most conducted by him, for around $30...what a bargain.  As a great admirer of Stravinsky, I find his interpretations to be, in general, my favorites.  Note there is little explanatory text; if more detail is required there are numerous books published about Stravinsky's music.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is why I love Amazons free app of the day. It helps me discover games like this one that I would probably never find in the app market.<br /><br />This game is great fun. The graphics, animations and sound effects are all top notch. The game starts out really easy to help you get used to the controls and gameplay but gets very challenging as you progress. My only slight complaint is that rotating items seems a little too sensitive and I sometimes need to do it a couple of times to get them to stay sideways. This could just be me though.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game and it is definitely worth the 99 cent asking price!

I was extremely persistent and it was WORTH IT!<br /><br />This book is a poignant, funny, intelligently-written story about what is means to love.  It also speaks to loss of all sorts and how people handle that.  I would highly recommend it.  Prenez vos mouchoirs!

B004EPZ084|1.0|Donald Sutherland, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston & Jamie Foxx. With a cast list like that, I expected a good movie. Unfortunately, their roles are all small ones. Sadly, the viewer is subjected to another modern day Hollywood comedy that isn't funny. This one with 3 male leads who spend 95% of the movie on screen together with no chemistry of any kind. Sutherland dies in the first 5 minutes which he was no doubt happy about once he realized the poor quality of the script. We are left with the 3 lead actors who try as hard as they can to pretend there is some sort of comic chemistry between them but it comes off as forced and strained, at best. Jason Bateman is a fine actor, yes, but here he is hopelessly lost in a terrible movie.  Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day, however,  appear destined to spend their careers being cast in National Lampoon movies or a similar franchise where the goal is to appeal to the bodily-function-as-humor crowd with a few dick jokes thrown in. Charlie Day is especially annoying. He has the worst voice I have ever heard in the history of film.  When he goes into his cringe-inducing, high pitched whine, even my dog leaves the room with a disgusted look on his face. The producers would have been better off making another movie using the talented supporting cast instead of these 3 fools. Aniston & Foxx were good. Spacey played a jerk boss exactly how you would expect him to, but he does such roles so well it works everytime. And the best of all was Colin Farrell whose portrayal of a coked-up sex fiend boss was hilarious. The only problem being he was only on screen for 10 minutes in the movie. Otherwise, I have nothing good to say about this movie except that Jonah Hill wasn't in it, oddly enough, since he seems to be in every movie made in Hollywood the last five years.
B0061S073A|4.0|This app is perfect for me because I have 3 toddlers. I love that if you have an app thatvhas ads that it redirects them to the kidszone home instead if to the ad. The only problem I have encountered is that if (on the kindle fire) you hit home, for about 2 seconds it shows the normal home screen before it back to the kids place home. if you are touching the screen at all at that point it will open whatever app you touch and exit kids place without asking for a password. So if they fix this it would definately be a 5 star app. much better now than other kid locking apps I tried.!

B004EPYZXU|2.0|For an 88 minute film, this movie seemed much longer! I don't usually bash on peoples work so I'm going to try not to here but...well, that might be a little too hard not to do. I hated this movie. Hated it. And I knew I would from the moment it started. I'm a big \\"found footage\\" movie fan. I'd happily watch Paranormal Activity any day of the week. However 'Apollo 18' I couldn't watch again to save my life! Ok, that's not true but you get the point. I'm warning you now, if you haven't seen it, SPOILERS!<br /><br />So, this movie is about these three guys that go to the moon on a secret mission. They can't tell their families or anything. So the movie is super boring in the beginning. I actually almost contemplated turning it off 5 minutes in. Anyways, two guys on the moon and some other dude is like...orbiting around it waiting for them. So the two guys on the moon are doing...space things. And then all of a sudden there is a dead Russian....and a Russian ship. So scary......And then, OMG there are killer....rocks? WHAT? lol. Ok? So, it was lame. rocks...yup. These people must have had a HUGE budget...I mean rocks...those are pretty rare right?<br /><br />Needless to say, this movie sucks. And although I only paid $1.20 for it at Redbox, I'd still like my $1.20 back. In all fairness I jumped at one part....and it wasn't even scary it was just the two guys fooling around and one of them scares the other. Scariest part in the entire film. I'm very interested to hear what other people thought of 'Apollo 18' so if you've seen it, please comment and let me know!
B002T4LP6S|4.0|Those nasty Ichneumon wasps!  Their larvae, growing within a caterpillar's body, start \\"by taking out the fat bodies and digestive organs, leaving the vital heart and nervous system till last....\\" (page 395) Um, say what?  Caterpillars, lacking any circulatory system, have no hearts.  Surely, Dawkins is writing metaphorically about caterpillar hearts and using a bit of intentional hyperbole here; however, in so doing, he assumes that his readers have just enough knowledge of caterpillar anatomy not to take him literally.  And that, I fear, is an unwarranted assumption.<br /><br />Will GREATEST SHOW accomplish Dawkins' aim of successfully arguing the truth of evolutionary change as contrasted with the \\"creationist\\" beliefs of certain theists?  No.  It seems to be one of the weaknesses of the human mind that rational, orderly thought and objective analysis of evidence stand no chance of winning a bout when the opponent is an unquestioning belief in any sort of deity, including the supposed creations of that deity.  Put another way, how can logic and reason ever hope to prevail over years of theistic indoctrination?  Superstition has always been a powerful adversary.  When the astronomer Galileo Galilei tried to enlighten his world to the fact that the earth revolved around the Sun rather than the other way around, the Inquisition in Rome found him \\"vehemently suspect of heresy,\\" ordered him to \\"abjure, curse and detest\\" those opinions and placed him under house arrest for the term of his life.  Somewhat more recently (in 2006), Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, head of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family, said that \\"scientists involved in research with human embryos, including embryonic stem-cell research, could be excommunicated. He also affirmed that excommunication is still applicable to persons who receive, perform or support abortions.\\"  It will take more than any book, no matter how well argued, to prevail in the face of such abysmal ignorance and superstition, resulting as they do from an unreasoning fear of the amoral universe in which all life finds itself.<br /><br />In THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, Dawkins may have somewhat overreached himself.  By that I mean that I encountered no truly novel concepts that I had not previously run across in several of his other published works.  That is not to say that GREATEST SHOW is in any way an inferior book, just that it seemed right on the verge of becoming repetitious of facts that the author has previously  explained elsewhere.  GREATEST SHOW does provide additional new examples of biological wonders and is certainly not a waste of time to read.  Nonetheless, the excellence of Dawkins' earlier book THE ANCESTOR'S TALE has yet to be exceeded.<br /><br />For the most part, GREATEST SHOW reads well, although inevitably, depending upon the reader's own interests, one finds some parts more intriguing than others.  In fact, I found the discussion of protein structure pretty sluggish going, but the parts on plate tectonics galloped right along, not that either topic was heretofore unknown to me but that I found the writing more enjoyable in some sections than in others.  One of the grand things about Dawkins' writing is that he is as much at home with literature as he is with the natural sciences, and his effective use of literary allusion here and there is nothing less than endearing to any bibliophile.<br /><br />In brief, I found GREATEST SHOW satisfying in that, while it did not introduce me to any totally new concepts, it did offer quite a few new examples to illustrate and demonstrate the fascinating workings of the physical and biological world.  It appears to me that any book can be evaluated in light of the fact that it requires a certain amount of time to read, time taken from the finite lifespan of every reader.  The ultimate question is whether the knowledge and concepts that one gains from reading THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH are worth the hours from one's lifethat are consumed by the reading.  To this question, I vote \\"yes,\\" and I recommend the book to any mature reader.is question, I vote \\"yes,\\" and I recommend the book to any mature reader.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is an incredible artist with a voice that resonates with passion, love and insight.  Her songs, especially \\"rising From the Deep\\" and \\"Rumour Has It\\"  have pulsing inectious beats and a wonderful sound.  Listen to the whole alum once to appreciate her range and then listen ot it again and listen to the words.  This album is one of the best of the last ten years.  This young woman puts to shame any American Idol winner of the past - Carrie Underwood comes close.
B004HO6I2E|2.0|I love Jason Bateman, but I really don't understand why he made this film????  Obnoxious and gross does not NECESSARILY EQUAL FUNNY.  When switching places movies happen, isn't the point for the characters to experience something they've never experienced before???  How much of a stretch would it be for a young married guy to - Oh My Gosh - imagine what it is like to be a single guy?!  Wasn't he single not that long ago?  They might as well make a movie about a college student who magically becomes a high school senior!!!
B006UG90RM|4.0|They have their edge back! It's not their best, but it's safe to say they're back! Great to have DLR back in the mix. Not a Sammy hater, but they didn't have that edge with Hagar. This album has that Fair Warning feel to it. And oh yes, Eddie still has game. Might be one of his best efforts ever. They do miss Michael Anthony's backup vocals but Wolfgang more than holds his own on the bass. Here's the way I rank the albums:  1. Van Halen  2. Fair Warning  3. 1984  4. Van Halen II  5. A Different Kind of Truth  6. Women and Children First  7. 5150  8. Diver Down  9. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge  10. OU812  11. Right Here, Right Now  12. Balance  13. Best of Van Halen, Volume I  14. Best of Both Worlds  15. Van Halen III

B005F6NA56|1.0|I almost never write reviews but I had to warn people to at least listen to the thumbnails before you purchase this.  I didn't....I love her previous work so I just assumed I'd love her new album.  As others have written, it is NOTHING like her previous two albums.  I found it depressing and boring.  I guess I'd call it a vanity piece, similar to Alainis Morissette's 2nd album that bored pretty much everyone to tears.  Someone else wrote that Feist recorded \\"the album that she wanted\\".  In my opinion she should have recorded it for herself and not released it to the public.  At some point don't you have to give your customers what they want?
0553801473|5.0|This books release was many years overdue as any follower of the series would know. The previous book \\"A feast for crows\\" was in my opinion, a low point for the series. Nonetheless, it was still a good book. \\"A dance with dragons\\" on the other hand returns to the characters such as tyrion, Jon snow, daenerys, even bran and arya. It is a great story, a smooth and epic read that will take you in and not release you until you have finished the book, cover to cover.
B0078JOAOI|4.0|While the first half of the season left me feeling unhappy with the lack of development while we continued to watch the group deal with the same issues week to week, the comeback promises new things on the horizon. The shock of events surrounding the mid-season finale seem to wake up some character that have remained static for a while and the path the group has before it now seems to open up. Not much action in this episode, but some surprising turns near the end leave me with hope for the rest of the season.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|Surprisingly, this was an exceptional movie. The scenery and cinematography were impeccable, and while the acting seemed a little slow at first, the story was both moving and engrossing. I'm glad I took the time to watch it, and perhaps you should too. Plus, it was great seeing the bad guys get their asses kicked in the end.

1401232590|1.0|What a waste of time! I am a new Batman fan but seriously? I have been reading the very first Batman's watching the shows ( Batman 1960 and Animated series) and playing the video games that have come in the last two years (Arkham Asylum and City).  I think the characterization of Batman is a little insulting.  Like a few people have mentioned here, Batman is a DETECTIVE!!! There is no way it would take a year for Batman to figure out who the killer was.  Have we seen the Animated show? It only takes him 20mins, plus minus the commercial breaks. ;) What else I really could not stand about this book and the HUSH book is Leob's use of well established villains for really no purpose.  I found it flashy and pointless.  The inner thoughts of Batman were also distracting and silly...It felt like Leob could not trust us what Batman was thinking...Have we lost the ability to read things that are implied?  The dialogue seemed so trite and like something I would hear on a late night Animee.  So drawn out just for the sake of drama!  .  I had to get that out...point is do not buy this book or the other one.  I don't really if this book was meant to be an homage to some other writers, by it self this book is awful.  If you want some good Batman just watch some Paul Dini episodes of the Animated Show. That is good story telling.

B00005JNQA|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. I am a big fan of political thrillers, but this one.....something is missing here. First off, I will admit that Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman give good performances. They're very convincing in their respective roles. The dialogue is sharp, I'll also give credit to that. But then, their chemistry is very uninteresting. It's almost the weakest element in the film. But it's not: the weakest part of The Interpreter is the lack of tension throughout the film. Usually, with such a fascinating plot, there would be plenty of suspense between the protagonists and the unknown force that's binding the story (in other words, the unknown antagonist). But there's hardly any tension, and that's mostly because the chemistry between Kidman and Penn's characters mostly get in the way. Just when you think that the story would progress, then in comes the the scenes involving the two characters' friendship. And then, there's the ending, which was relatively predictable.<br /><br />The Interpreter isn't really that bad, but it's not great, either. The film is marred by lack of suspense, unnecessary chemistry between Penn and Kidman, and a fairly predictable ending. Our two actors give very nice performances, though, and if you're a fan of either of them, you MIGHT feel satisfied with this movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.4 out of 10
B003B5M0PO|5.0|War horse is my most favourite book.  I first really heard about it was when I started seeing the ads for the movie on the T.V. I love the way Michael wrote the book and how to me was as if I was there watching with my own eyes.  I love the books Michael Morpurgo writes, I have War horse (of course) on my Kindle and I got Mr Nobody`s eyes as a normal book and I really want to read Long Way Home. He is a great writer and I hope he keeps on wrtiting.  I reckon 5 stars, amazing book

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had trouble getting into this book at first.  In fact, I duel-read it with The Hunger Games and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was finished them both before the action in A Game of Thrones began at about 55% through.  Once the action picks up, however, it's hard to put the book down.  The battle sequences are epic, with forces greater than 30,000.  I can't wait to start reading the next book.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|my opinion is............. That angry birds seassons is a fun game.I think its all about consentrashen and focus on getting all the pigs down. and some of the birds are funny and tricky like the boomerang bird if you got to the leavel.Its hard to controll it.  that's my opinion it may be bad but I don't care if people don't like it thanks.for reading.
030726999X|4.0|Short Review: if you've already read the first two books of this series, the third is a must-buy. Simple as that.<br /><br />Detailed Review: The story kicks off right where the second book left us. Lisbeth Salander has been very badly wounded and is immediately taken to a hospital for emergency surgery. Her half-brother, the monster of a man named Ronald Niedermann, has escaped and is on the run after murdering a police officer.<br /><br />Our male hero and often-times womanizer Mikael Blomkvist has uncovered the secret about Alexander Zalachenko, Salander's father, and desperately works against time to figure out the incredible story of corruption that resulted in Salander being locked up in a psychiatric ward as a child. The story will leave you shocked at times, as the (numerous) criminals work behind the scenes using any means necessary to ensure Blomkvist and the police don't uncover their secrets. There are twists and turns at every stage, and even while being cooped up in the hospital for over half the book, Salander plays her part in helping Blomkvist as well as assisting Erika Berger in an interesting subplot. And just like the second book, there will be a few times where you go \\"did that seriously just happen??\\" There are a LOT of characters to keep track of, but they all serve their purpose well.<br /><br />Inevitably, the book moves on to the trial and the charges brought against Salander. She and her allies, along with lawyer Annika Giannini (Mikael's sister), must work to overturn the seemingly incontrovertible evidence the prosecution believes it has. Meanwhile, Blomkvist continues working at a restless pace to discover just who the behind-the-scenes criminals are as well as putting together a book detailing Salander's life story.<br /><br />There are a few flaws, however. I do not know how Swedish courtrooms work in real life, but the trial seemed to have a very, very relaxed atmosphere. An example: Giannini will be questioning a witness for a little while, and then will turn around and have a conversation with Salander, out loud in front of everyone, uninterrupted. Prosecutor Ekstrom barely says anything aside from the first day of the trial. Holger Palmgren gives \\"advice\\" to the judge on one occasion. It's all a bit too relaxed.<br /><br />Also, while in the hospital, Salander and Zalachenko are placed only two rooms apart from each other. Here are two family members who tried to kill each other, and yet only two sets of walls separate them. Surely the doctors are smarter than that.<br /><br />Overall, the conclusion to this wonderful series will not disappoint, and it is only a shame that Larsson is no longer with us, as there was a fourth book (and possibly more) in the works. Alas, it was not to be, and Larsson does a wonderful job tying up the loose ends at different stages throughout the book.<br /><br />Finally, some fun discussion questions for folks who have already finished the book (SPOILERS INCLUDED):<br /><br />1) What was the point of including Camilla Salander as a character since we never get to know her? Was she perhaps meant to be revealed in the unfinished fourth book?<br /><br />2) Did anyone else think the conclusion to Erika Berger's subplot (Fredriksson's reason for harassing her) was absurd? The plot was interesting, but the conclusion was disappointing.<br /><br />3) Do you think Blomkvist and Figuerola will live happily ever after or can he not keep his hands off of Berger?<br /><br />4) Is Salander truly capable of living a full, happy life? Or will she always be running around, unable to strike a deep human connection with anyone else?ave a conversation with Salander, out loud in front of everyone, uninterrupted.

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Very disappointed! The main actors are all great actors, but I found that the director did not use them accordingly. I found this movie very boring and even though I'm a huge fan of the book, I don't mind loose versions, but this one is too incomplete, missing important parts and characters of the book, so why to name the film \\"Jane Eyre\\"?. In my opinion the main problem is the lack of chemistry between Mia and Michael. I saw this DVD three times to see if I was wrong, but still, you don't feel the chemistry of the two main characters and without that, there is not Jane Eyre. If you want a good version, with actors that make you feel like you are really leaving the story and that they care deeply about each other then buy the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. To me that is the best version.

B0053VKP8S|4.0|I purchased this to be able to stream itunes from my computer through Apple TV to my stereo using my ipad as a controller.  HDMI through tv with a an rca cable to the stereo works well, however I find it a waste of energy to have a 40\\" tv on just to listen to music.  The D/A converter allows me to connect a digital toslink cable to my NAD amp which does not have digital inputs (toslink or HDMI).  Two caveats:  Have your stereo volume turned way down until itunes starts output, otherwise you will hear loud white noise than can blow your speakers and your hearing if not careful.  Secondly, turn off the Dolby 5.1 setting in Apple TV setup to output stereo.  This D/A converter will not decode Dolby 5.1.  Otherwise, these is a handy workaround  for legacy stereos that do not have digital inputs. Sound is excellent.  Downside, I wish it did not have a wall wart power transformer.  Product specs says it only pulls a half watt.

B005LZW8FO|2.0|Being one of those low budget independent movies, only those who purposely seek these things out with some hatred towards Hollywood movies will brag on and on about how this is supposed to be an ingenious masterpeice. Well, the director should have taken some tips from those Hollyweed movies and given this one here a much faster pace instead of boring you to tears for the most part.  The plot is rather interesting tho, a 19 year old girl hears on the radio that a new star has just been found in the sky that may be able to support life. As she looks in the sky while driving (drunk I think) she crashes her car into a family of 3. She goes to prison for 4 years and when she is released, she seeks out the man who survived the crash, but lost his wife and young child in the process. He has no idea who she is when she knocks on his door, but instead of saying what she wanted, she tells him she is a cleaner and he hires her to clean his house. They end up falling in love but she doesn't want to proceed with the relationship because she has not told him the truth. All while this is happening, the discovery of the new star is discovered to be another Earth that they call Earth II. There is a contest online for someone to win a trip on a shuttle to go and visit the planet, and the main actresses dream is to go and explore space, or the new planet where scientists have discovered Earth II is a planet where everyone on Earth I had a double, where everything had been the exact same events on both Earths until the time of discovering each other, 4 years before hand when it was first announced.  You can probably already guess how this movie ends. It is fairly predictable. But seeing through the idea of trying to gain interest in some sort of Sci-Fi idea of two planets, it's more of a story of a woman who causes a tragic accident, meets the man she killed the wife and kid of,accidentally gets involved with him, and their sad/depressed lives change them into more happier people... and then, later, you can probably predict what happens in the end.  To me tho, the premise and story are far more interesting then actually having to sit through this. For the most part, I was bored and yawning while my girlfriend told me to shut-up and hope it gets better. It doesn't. There is no pace, it drags on, there is no fun, comedy or anything really of any entertainment value. It's also one of those movies that must not have run long enough to call it a full length one, so inserted is a bunch of useless scenes that are not needed to do anything other then make the movie seem longer. I wanted to bleach my own eyes having to sit through that useless dribble of filler. My girlfriend was loving the cheaply made CGI scenes of Earths sky showing another Earth in the sky like the moon, but I have seen it done before, and much better, and was not at all impressed by it.  I can definitely see other people enjoying this movie, for various reasons, but for people like me who like something about a movie to be memorable, or something that makes a movie burn into your mind and make you remember it, this movie just failed to leave me with anything other then feelings of being bored and wanting to reach for the skip button, fast forward, or the off switch.  So, keep in mind, this is one of those independent movies that people praise because it's not half as bad as most indie-films and it seems artsy-fartsy enough to be praised by someone who would turn their nose up at average entertainment movies because they are given more of a budget to work with then these kind of films and would rather support blah blah blah blah... you know the story, it's too boring to keep going on with.  I'd rather have read this as a book than watched it, it really did show scenes of this girl standing still for a few minutes, while you guess what is going through her head, she may as well have had a voice over saying things like \\"I saw the dust on the bench projecting a light yellow as the setting sun dripped through the old stain glass windows that didn't look like they had been washed since Bill Clinton last slept with his wife and didn't think of some other, more youthful, woman's melons that had no wrinkles or a stench of Rosie O'Donnell's breath attached to them\\".  Also, if you are expecting this to be a sci-fi movie, guess again. It's a drama, the Earth II thing could easily be taken out and this would still be the same story, just with an alternate ending, possibly a thriller, which would have been more entertaining if you ask me.  See it if it interests you, but I really wouldn't expect too much from it if you think it's going to be absolutely brilliant.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not bad for 101 free games. Yeah, you need to unlock most of them, but it wouldn't be fun if you got them all at once. The main reason I continue to play is in hopes of finding one relatively exceptional game.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Hey,... For all of you who waited to get this album: You backed the wrong horse!    The Foo Fighters may have been down, but they, Certainly, after 5 Grammies, yesteday, are back on Top!    This album deserves better than the the '5 second mentality of 'sound bytes' and deserves a good listen! It is great and I knew it when I pre-ordered, months ago, and got the Deadmou5 version of Rope and an additional bonus track to boot(13 tracks not 11).    Even better,... It was made in a Garage using Analog equipment, and they threw out the digital 'fixings'.    It is a True 'garage band' album, and that in it self is Major; when Digital Computerizing every 'lick, and line', seems to be the way to go.    I remember when you Really had to Play Well, and Sing, Too. Dancing was never a major component of ANY shows. The music really counted.    So much for the 'Auto tune' Generation, who missed out on learning to sing well and play correctly. Analogue recording is Meant to be a difficult process. It is Nice to see some musicians can still back that up, having talent Before they record.    Today a 'hack', with a computer can make a CD, but that only illustrates the Point: Even if you can type, it doesn't mean you can write the 'Great American Novel', the first try.    Sooooo sorry if you waited, but the album is, well.. in a word: the Best Rock Album of 2011 for a reason!!    That's a Fact. Check it out, the deep tracks are as good as the ones on the radio. If not, just cherry pick the good tunes if you cant stand that, but do try and give it a chance, because there is no substitute for real hard work and talent. This is an album that personifies that idea. It shows on every track.    This is a Great addition to your collection of music just to have a wider appreciation of the Bands who go for a more 'organic sound'. I couldnt tell the difference between analog and digital because I was listening to the music, not seeking perfection from 'Rock' in the studio. It was Never meant tosound perfect, but this album gives some credibility to that process, and may it forever be used.    Congratulations Foo Fighters!

B004N66XYE|5.0|As a fan of the original series , I was, at best, hopeful.  I fell in love with the series.  Moreover, I fell in love with the characters.  Jean Marsh's Rose Buck, along with the house, 165 Eaton Place,* is the link to the original series.    Eileen Atkins as the dowager Lady Maud Holland is a treasure.  All the characters are fully rendered and each is significant in their own right.  While it might be thought boring, the family and the servants are all lovable.  With the expected friction of living with people, they treat one another with respect and affection.    Like the original, this series is historical fiction.  It aspires to authenticity, rather than mere accuracy, but, like most such drama, it is the story, the art, that we enjoy.  Like the original, this  series was all too short.  The original started awkwardly as a comedy but grew into an epic drama.  It was still too short.  This one was designed as a whole, ended on a high, and left us wanting more.    Update.  After writing the review above, I went to check for any news about a second season.  Indeed, there will be one and it is generating a lot of coverage in the British broadsheets and tabloids.  The difference in the coverage is enough to generate a review or two all by itself.    Jean Marsh, my age, suffered a minor stroke and so has been written into a tuberculosis sanitarium for the first episode but will appear later.  Jean Marsh is so identified in my mind with Rose that when I see her in other roles I often do not recognize her.    Eileen Atkins, who was so good as Lady Maud Holland, has been written out altogether.  Lady Maud will be replaced in the household by her younger half-sister, Dr. Blanche Mottershead, played by Alex Kingston.  I confess I am saddened.  The series cannot be quite the same without these two grand dames who created it.  Most of the great Downstairs cast will return and be joined by a few fresh faces.    I do not like previews, but if you are interested, you can findone at [...]    *Eaton Place exists, in Belgravia, but 165 is fictional.  \\"London's Belgravia serves as the well-heeled setting for most of the action in Upstairs Downstairs, but the exterior shots of 165 Eaton Place are filmed at an elegant terrace of Georgian townhouses in Clarendon Square, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.\\" It seems that the traffic on the real Eaton place is so heavy and London so noisy that a quieter local had to be found.  Fortunately the same architect had created a suitable site. If anything, it is even more elegant.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Courageous tries to cover too many subjects and therefore weakens it main message: that it takes courage to raise children in a God-honored way.  This movie could have been edited down 20 minutes without loosing its impact.  Christianity is more than expecting God to fulfill our every wish and desire through prayer.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Heartbreaking and addictive is all I can say. The second serious is a bit dull at first than the first book; however their adventures at the arena is as fascinating as the first one.

The love emotion between them is so beautiful and romantic.

B005N95JA4|5.0|Some was a great album-BEFORE it was remasterredd and with the extra songs.  if you like the Stones, you must have this CD collection.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I bought this CD a few weeks ago and I will admit I bought it solely because of Eddie Vedder. I recently watched [[ASIN:B005LLXB9K Pearl Jam Twenty]] and after losing track of the band I have spent time recently catching up on Pearl Jam music. I listened to the samples of this CD and I was interested enough to purchase it, but I was still somewhat skeptical the first few times I listened to it. I am glad I kept listening to it because once I was able to get past the \\"Pearl Jam version\\" of Eddie Vedder that I (and many others) are so used to I was able to really enjoy this CD on its own merit. I have been listening to this CD every morning and evening during my daily train commute and I have not gotten tired of it yet. The songs are simple, beautiful, and quickly get stuck in your head. After being a fan of the earlier days of Pearl Jam and Eddie's wilder days it is interesting to see and hear the same person that has evolved and is now singing these beautiful, calm songs.  For specific Pearl Jam fans (myself included), Eddie has not forgotten his roots as he continues to write, record, and tour with Pearl Jam. But it is nice to see him showcase other talents and for his fans to be able to appreciate this softer side of Eddie Vedder.

B003MC5N28|4.0|The Giver was a very interesting and exciting book about a couple of communities that are under the restriction of everyone being the same.  This story is a well written one about a boy named Jonas that is elected for the highest position in the community.  It is a strange concept because they don't know colors, animals, hills, clouds, heat, cold, rain, or snow.  All in all this was a very good book because I always wanted to see what was on the next page.
B005IU1OMA|1.0|One star for the riding, which was great. But great riding just isn't enough any more. We've all seen a lot of great riding. I was disappointed with this film mainly because of the extensive use of slo-mo shots of helicopters. It seems that the film makers were short on actual snowboarding footage, and used nearly as much B-roll as A-tape. A narrative arc would have helped viewers enjoy the rare but fantastic bits of snowboarding. Many of us in the snowboarding community were excited when Jeremy Jones swore off helicopters a few years ago and vowed to learn how to mountaineer. I was hoping that would spark a movement. This film is a huge remission from that sentiment. The carbon footprint must have been epic. Using three helicopters in some shoots and cruising around for days on extremely dirty snowmobiles does not set a good example and really makes those of us that care about nature disgusted. I've read some reviews that say if you like nature you will like this film. I offer the opposite: if you like nature you should hate this film. Please just learn how to climb already and get to the summit on your own steam. Otherwise you are just wasting resources and really don't deserve to be in the mountains. I also have to give negative points for the dialogue, which was unintentionally funny at times and nauseatingly trite throughout. Basically we have a collection of slo-mo helicopters taking off and some sweet snowboarding action interspersed. Not bad, but not nearly what I was expecting from this over-hyped group of riders. I also would have appreciated some new talent in the film. How about some women? Maybe if the crew didn't have such a helicopter fetish they could find some ladies to ride with! There are many riders out there that are also good mountaineers. The riders in this film come across as bumbling idiots in the mountains. They should learn how to climb mountains or else go back to the park. This is the same snowboarding film we've seen a thousand times but with more slo-mo shots of helicopters. I was uninspired and even a little angry. The ending was particularly blah; I guess that's what happens when you stumble through 90 minutes of self-obsessed B-roll and never have a plot. I hope this is the low point for snowboarding films and that in the future we can watch a film that uses a $2 million dollar budget to create something worth watching. Is it asking too much for a film that advances the sport rather than showing off toys, offering nothing new, and reinforcing all the negative stereotypes?

A few reviewers also said the same thing.  Think anytime now a 4 disc best of set should come out.  Otherwise this is not a bad piece of music for the average fan.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B006PHD0RW|2.0|I got this to try because it was free.  I Have a kindle fire and the app is very unresponsive to rotating. You just have to keep trying until it decides to react, then you are out of time.  Very frustrating.  Also, it is just boring. Nothing exciting to keep you wanting to advance.  Already uninstalled.  Just glad I didn't pay for this one.
0307948560|2.0|You may also read my review here: [...]  Being a working mom, I immediately thought that this book would appeal to me... but it seemed to miss the mark at just about every turn.    Kate, the main bread-winner in her family, works an obscene amount of hours, leaving the house before her kids have eaten breakfast and not getting home until after they are asleep. All day she agonizes over her work-life balance yet never seems to do anything to adjust it. Constantly pulled away from the home on business trips to other countries, Kate seems to have chosen her work-life over her home-life, to the point that she fantasizes about having an affair with an American client.    Have you ever heard the saying \\"You can't have your cake and eat it too\\"? That is how I felt about Kate... you can't expect to have kids and NOT give up some part of your life. Having obviously chosen her career over her family, it drove me crazy when Kate suddenly has an epiphany, when her kids are 6-years-old and 2-years-old, that she is throwing away her life with her children. It takes her husband leaving, her nanny falling ill and her assistant becoming the office 'joke' before she puts her life priorities straight. Immediately my thought was, \\"Really?!?! You wasted SIX YEARS of your relationship with your daughter and NOW you decide to be a 'Mom'\\"... Ugg.    Overall, this book was too unrealistic for me. It could be that my feelings on the whole work vs. family thing are a little too strong, but, as a mother, you will ALWAYS put your children first... ALWAYS!!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />OOS EFFECTS:<br />There are about 25 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, 44 effects between 25 and 30%, 6 at 40%, 3 at 50% and 3 more around 60%. If I had to pick just 3 of my favorite effects from this film, they would be the biting fish at up to 30%, the carnivorous plant around 35% and a glowing bird that flits around between 25% and 40% for about 20 seconds. There are lots of other nice effects for you to pick your own favorites from.<br /><br />IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:<br />The depth is, for the most part consistent from scene to scene and is natural to SLIGHTLY exaggerated looking because the footage is so crisp and clear. In fact, the live action 3D is done so well that in some outdoor scenes, the fact that it is actually an indoor set or green-screened, becomes noticeable. (Did I just complain about 3D being done too well?? Must be a full moon or something.

Many have audio so that you can listen in the car. if wi-fi isn't available, you can locally store many translations for reading at anytime.  There are sometimes glitches but considering this is a free app, I have no complaints.  I would pay $10 for this app and still be very satisfied.  I have it on my kindle and I have it on my iphone.  I have been using it for 2 years and have tried most of the others on the market. None come close to this.  Having an audio Bible costs upwards of $50-60 and this app gives you several for free!

I managed to get to the end, what a waste.

142311339X|5.0|SUMMARY -<br />When Jason wakes up on a bus headed toward the Grand Canyon, he has no memory.  What he does have is a beautiful girlfriend named Piper and a best friend named Leo.  They are a part of a school for troubled children; everyone knows who Jason is and has memories about him - except their coach.  Then things get even worse - the school hottie turns into a monster, and storm spirits attack them on the Grand Canyon.  Jason knows he has training for this, but from where?  They barely defeat the storm spirits when a chariot pulled by flying horses appears on the scene to take them to Camp Half-Blood, where demigods reside.  The girl, Annabeth, needs Jason's help.  A very special Hero has disappeared, and Jason is the one to lead the Quest to find him.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS -<br />Oh, Rick Riordan, you have quite tortured me with this book.  First you steal away my first and an only true demigod love and put him in possible danger - again!  And then you create a new demigod who comes to a close second and make me love him!  Oh, it is just too much!<br /><br />What drew me in from the first was that my dearest Percy Jackson was missing, and I must go on a quest to save him!  But I learned - this book is more than that.  Riordan has created a new series, yes, but it is a continuation of the story of the Olympians, and I believe big plans are in store.  (If you haven't read Percy Jackson and the Olympians, you don't need to in order to read this book.  But honestly, I'd start there.  If I hadn't had the knowledge I did, or loved the characters I loved, it would have come across as less amazing, in my personal opinion.)<br /><br />It was very interesting to read Riordan in third person, as well as from three new perspectives (Piper, Leo, and Jason).  But he nailed it.  Really nailed it.  I'm incredibly impressed.<br /><br />CHARACTER NOTES -<br />Let's start with Jason.  He was wonderful.  Kind of hardened by a past he doesn't remember, by his frustration, but he still made an effort to be a friend and help the camp.  And when I found out whose son he was, I about died of excitement.  Over the course of the book, I found myself more and more drawn to him.  By the end, I was hooked.  I want more Jason!  I also want romance between him and Piper.  It's mandatory.<br /><br />Speaking of Piper... Dang, I love that girl.  She's a heroine who is drop-dead gorgeous and kicks butt.  I don't want to compare or anything but I liked her better than Annabeth.  Of course, Annabeth is the perfect other half for Percy (who is my one true love), so for that I love her, but I was able to relate to Piper more as far as personality and real-life-outside-of-camp go.  (Definitely not the drop-dead gorgeous/kick-butt stuff...haha!)  She made my laugh, she was strong, and she loves unconditionally, even when she has to make hard choices between friends.<br /><br />Leo definitely amazed me.  He possesses great skill, is sensitive to those around him, and has a past he wants to bury.  He was a crack-up and had the funniest one-liners of the group.  He made the team on the quest complete!<br /><br />The other characters were all up to par, especially the hilarious Gleeson Hedge, wise Thalia, and adorable Mellie.  I want more of all these fantastic characters!<br /><br />STORY NOTES -<br />This is a crazy story, in all the best ways.  Nonstop action, intense physical and emotional struggles, and a lovely new budding romance.  Then there's the mystery of the new villains, and how to defeat them.  Who's behind it all?!  I also really like how the POV changes added to the atmosphere, giving a different perspective to everything and everyone.<br /><br />There are quite a bit more visions, dreams, and prophecies in this book, which I really enjoyed.  new gods are introduced, some good, some funny, some evil.  I loved the Roman aspect of the story (brings up a lot of questions); Roman/Gladiator training = definitely amazing.  It's a great way to learn mythology, even the lesser known stories.  Let's just say - I love Heroes.  Wanna know who my favorite is?  Duh!  Percy! :D<br /><br />SUMMING IT UP -<br />Lightning.  It's fast, bright, and awe-inspiring.  (And let me give you a sneak peak at my review for #2, Son of Neptune: it was even better than this one!!)  I'm already impatiently awaiting book three, The Mark of Athena, due out this fall.  You really can't go wrong with Rick Riordan!!uh!  Percy! :D  SUMMING IT UP -  Lightning.  It's fast, bright, and awe-inspiring.

B006YXTRHY|2.0|I always felt I favored the movies more than I ought to have, beause I liked the books! 'Twilight' managed to work with it's indie edge and haunting score, and the 'new moon' as well as 'eclipse' movies told the story well enough. My vivid imagination had envisioned a more handsome Edward, and definitely a more beautiful Bella, in an understated sort of way, but looks are subjective and I was keen to embrace the actors finally chosen. They were never going to be oscar contenders, the acting could be bad at times, but all in all, these movie adaptations worked ...until now.  I'll start with the positves, but they are few and far between. I realized right away that Carter Burwell was back as the composer. The score was wonderful! Even the soundtrack managed to send us back to the beginning with 'flightless bird.' The outdoor setting was a more romantic option than the indoor book version, but they should have played Wagner as the book indicated. This is where the criticism begins.   The low back number was a bad choice of dress for a virgin Bella. Anyway, she was supposed to light up, and be in 'awe' of him, when she finally saw him waiting for her, but instead she looked constipated, or maybe she had a case of diverticulitis? There is no getting around the bad acting during that isle scene. Then came the stupid, piontless, time wasting, drudgery of ridiculous speeches. It's then that I realized the wedding was over, and I had been left unmoved.  Then came the honeymoon. They are somewhere in a hot tropical island and Edward never sparkles, ever! Then there was the small matter of the love scene. Oh dear! Years ago when I watched a movie called 'like water for chocolate,' a movie where the couple love each other all their lives since childhood, and when they finally get to consumate their love, all we see is him going up to her, blowing the candle, and a few wimpers of passion in the darkness. I remember feeling the emotion of that scene, more than I would scenes of half naked movie stars, in explicit love scenes. My piont is, this was the scene we'd been waiting for, and it lacked creativity. The 'cold mountain' scene is another example of an anticipated love scene that worked. The fact that apparently the actors are dating in real life and there was zero chemistry in all the honeymoon scenes is quite sad. Don't even get me going about, the broken bed and bruises, because the less said about that the better, but again, poetic license, was unused, no creativity, no power of suggestion, nada! Then, to srtetch out the story, They keep playing chess, again, and again. I know it's on the cover of the novel, but we got the inference right away, we didn't have to have it spelled out to us.  I can't quite put a finger on whats wrong with this movie. the pace is wrong, that's for sure. They completely missed out on Jacob's witticism when the story gets told with him as the first person. He was hilarious. Instead what was laughable was the telepathic wolf scene heard in different voices. Good Lord! It apprears to be the same screen writer, so perhaps asking her to stretch one movie into two parts, just to cash in and be like 'Harry Potter,' is what went wrong. Maybe the editing, or the director not getting the essence of the story. Someone should be blamed for this pile of crap!  The monster baby! Theres a scene in the movie 'boomerang,' where Grace Jones gives birth in a freaky commercial. The similarities were uncanny. Well, maybe not, but I hated it as much. And though I didn't know at what point this first part would end, I was hoping Bella would die anyway and then surely, the movie would have to end, and I would be put out of my misery. Thankfully, it ended soon after, a good thing because I couldn't have taken much more. Uurgh!

B000FC2KL0|5.0|I adore this book. I've only been an RHCP fan for a few years but after reading this book, I feel like I can understand Anthony in a completely different way. Now, when I listen to their music, I fully comprehend the meaning of their lyrics and know the story behind it. It makes the music even more enjoyable. I LOVE ANTHONY KIEDIS and I love this book. it's a MUST READ!!  Anthony Kiedis is known for his past drug addictions and so OF COURSE he is going to talk about them in his book. And other people write how he \\"brags about his sexual escapades\\" throughout the book. But this is not true. The sex stories are explaining the different relationships he's had and how they never worked out due to his infidelity. It's not bragging, it's part of his story!!  This book is an incredible piece of work, and I would recommend this to any Red Hot Chili Pepper fan.

0470638842|5.0|It is true - what happens in Vegas, no longer stays in Vegas.  It is now posted for the entire world to see on every social media outlet there is!  The same holds true for customer service, which seems to be a dying breed these days.  In the old days, service providers lived by the motto \\"the customer is always right\\".  Now service providers seem to care more about the volume/quantity of service that they provide rather than the quality of service.  Thanks to social media, however, I may lose my argument with your manager about my food being cold or the rudeness of the clerk at the checkout counter, but you will lose valuable customers when I POST about my experience with your company or organization for the entire world to see!  It's amazing how one upset customer and their expressed voice on a social media can stir a movement into action!  It makes you wonder, who's talking about MY COMPANY or their experience with ME?
1594202842|5.0|This book is funny, clever and a good read and a captivating recording. Its about time that Asian American parents can talk about these family issues out in the open. Its so good that my kids listened to it in the car.  People take the book too literally and the last chapter puts all her critics to shame for being too critical and thin skinned.
0812979656|3.0|Yes it was a new book and in great condition.  Plus it took no time getting to me. But I ended up having to pay more than a bestselling hardback for the paperback I ordered.  However, this was the only place I could find the book easily and very quickly. Was the convenience worth the price? I can only say that it really depends on one's perspective.  At the time I was working on a project and needed the book a.s.a.p. and started reading it.  *Note:  I had the book and lent it to a friend a couple of years ago.  I first read it as required reading for a class and loved the book.  It consequentially became one of my all-time favorite books and I have read it many times but not in years. I knew I'd get the book back faster by just buying it again rather than asking the friend for the book back. I leave it as a gift of wondrous reading.*  But then crisis happened and priorities had to be changed. I still haven't finished the book.  So in hindsight, I could have probably taken the time and patience to find the book cheaper elsewhere or even spent more time looking on Amazon.  But my rating stands because it was just ridiculously expensive in my opinion. It is a paperback. It should not cost what I paid for it.  I'm disabled. The computer is all I have to make an income and I have too much work to do. I don't always have time for all of that kind of research anymore as my work increases. I have a very tight budget in order work and even paying a dollar more than I think something should sell for makes a huge difference in my ability to support myself.  -the end
030788743X|5.0|Really one of the best audio books I have listen to in a long time. Probably most relevant for 30 and 40 somethings who know what at TRS-80 is and played the old text based adventures and hung around in arcades playing things like Defender, PacMan and Tempist.  The book is really well written, constructed with really interesting characters and some suprises that I really did not see coming.  The story has been well covered in these posts, I can not recommend it highly enough.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I have read in my life. I was expecting more of a horror story but it was more strange, heartwarming, and obviously peculiar. Buy the end of the book had fallen in love with everyone of the children! If your into this kind of story line I reccommend it 100%. If you don't enjoy stories like this then I don't reccommend it, because you will give bad reviews and that's the last thing this book needs. Ransom Riggs did a fantasticly amazing job with this book. I don't reccommend it for the kindle though, there are hand written letters that are very hard to read on the kindle. The actual book is $10 more but worth it since the letters are very important to the story. My only issue with the book was the unresolved ending. But the ending set the book up for a sequel, which I will DEFINATLY be sure to buy if a sequel is written.

0670022411|4.0|Before I began this book I expected it to less fantasy, less romance, and more historical.<br />I got exactly the opposite.<br />That being said, I couldn't put it down and was oddly emotionally invested in the characters and the story, to the point where I re-read sections after finishing the book. Though I am hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly why, since it's not the kind of thing I'm usually into. (I laughingly contributed it to subliminal messaging but it really is a good story).<br />I do very much recommend the book. It is enthralling. Approach it with the appropriate expectations and you'll be fine.<br /><br />First of all, this book is, apparently, the first in a series. Had I known this at the outset I may have had a different reaction, but I was heartily irritated at the utter lack of a standalone story. 15 pages from the end I became anxious thinking \\"this can't possibly wrap up before the book is over\\" and bracing for the (I thought) inevitable sell-out ending. But instead, I got no ending at all and was left with a million questions. Almost as if the author had the entire series finished and arbitrarily chose a point to end the first book.<br /><br />Second, the book is a fantasy and a romance. The premise is that creatures like witches and vampires actually exist in the real world. There is a hugely prominent love story. The females in the book are sometimes overly-helpless and the males are sometimes overly-manly in your classic romance fashion. It wasn't so bad that i put the book down but I did roll my eyes more frequently than the story could have merited without the cliche additions. (the female character is rescued like a damsel in distress, because she did something stupid and bullheaded) I just chose to imagine things slightly differently.<br /><br />As i said, though, I recommend it. It has enough characters, intrigue and action to keep you entertained.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is the best rock album from Van Halen since 1984 and the best I've heard from rock since the Black album fro Metallica!!  Honeybabysweetiedoll - One of the odder tracks on the album, something like finding a foreign broadcast of Martian rock on the radio by way of Southern California, but it goes right into 1984 again, as if the boys had never stopped jamming together for all those years. It's sexy, and fast, and it's like a moonlight ride with your lover with the lights off doing 125 on the highway as you get closer to... oh, you know what! Another growling mastertake.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|Bought this album because it was Paul,knowing they were oldies interpreted by Paul and enjoyed all of them...Enjoyed the two new songs Paul wrote as well...My Valentine and Only Our Hearts,that are done in the vein of the other songs.Not usually my style,but have always had an ear for everything.I only imagine listening to these songs in a bar with the relaxed feel of lounging.If you like Paul and perhaps not into the style of oldies,I would give it a try.He pulls it off perfectly in his own unique,McCartney style...I know I will listen to it several times and always know it's a good way to relax...Get it now while it's HOT!!!!

B002BWP49C|1.0|I watched the first three and each declined in quality as they came out. The actors have aged quite a bit and look very different now and that does not help the horrible script or the silly performances. I mean, the joke is over and no adult could possibly find any reason to watch the next one. UGH!
0375413405|5.0|Definitely a MUST HAVE for the Julia Child fanatic. You will be blown away by the simplicity of every recipe and how 'user friendly' yet satisfying they are. The mayonaise is a MUST. This book should not only be in EVERY kitchen, but it should be used on a regular basis.

B000JLPMPS|4.0|A great movie and fantastic acting  with great direction.  The big but for me is that Clint has done better.  The outlaw josey wales in my opinion was better.  I heard clint bought the rights for this movie (unforgiven) a lot of years back before making it.  He must have had some reason to hold onto it because it is a great movie.  Maybe He just wanted to age into the role.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The new McCartney songs on the album My Valentine and Only Our Hearts are written in the 30s/40s genre, but they also are definitely McCartney songs --- in my opinion, both of them are gems.  Despite the fanfare for My Valentine I also really like Only Our Hearts.  The other songs on the album are also great.  Inch Worm with its choir reminds me of McCartney's songs Rupert the Bear and Tropical Island Hum.  Home (When Shadows Fall) is great!  It is fun to have McCartney introduce you to some of his favorite tunes from the 30s and 40s.  Bravo Paul on another great album.

And James Franco was a perfect pick for this role - he did such an excellent job.<br /><br />I love Aron Ralston's sense of humor and his general gusto for life and adventure. There is a LOT of \\"personality\\" here - a very likable personable guy and you will enjoy the journey and appreciate his strength of character, his courage and his will to live.<br /><br />For those of you who are all squeamish - this is not some horrible gory movie, and it's not \\"depressing\\" either.  It's a wonderful story of adventure, and courage with some great landscape footage too. You already know he lives, he survives, so nix all those excuses and watch this amazing true story.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|We love this film and could watch it over and over again. Great effects, great storyline and great acting. For those of us who never saw one first hand, it's informative.

0061733199|4.0|Wow.  This book as all of the bases covered, and I mean all of them!  Every concieveable situation is addressed in great detail.  It's definitely a reference book vs a practical guide.  This book is going to show you how to tie 3,756 kind of knots, which is awesome, but in reality, you probalby only need to know a few good ones and know them well.  I would recommend.  I'm glad I have it.  I would buy it again.

B000B5OD4I|5.0|The watch itself is the best watch I have ever had and is extremely affordable for under $200, I own a Rolex and this has taken much more abuse without faltering unlike the Rolex (which I need to come up with almost $500 just to have it repaired). It is an automatic so it never needs a battery it is powered by the movement of your arm.  Not as accurate as quartz watches but this has not bothered me at all, I merely adjust it once a week or so.  It is extremely well built and is extremely popular.  Great EDC watch.  It combines the durability of a watch that costs thousands for a couple hundred and also looks nice so you can wear it out and it will blend in with whatever attire you wear quite well.  The watch face also is extremely easy to read, more so than any other watch I've had.  The only knock on this watch is the band that it ships with, but this can easily be remedied by purchasing a better band and there are several third market bands that will be more than adequate .
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I think people expected this movie to be non-stop cornball comedy, a reasonable assumption given the 3 main actors.  In fact, I almost didn't see it because I prefer other types of movies.  However, we loved it!  We thought it was funny, and a light-hearted drama, and, most of all, interesting.  After the movie we looked up the information they gave in the movie, and it appears that the basic facts are true, such as there being a \\"Big Year\\" birdwatching contest, and the birds on the Attu Island (which I'd never heard of).  Although we enjoy nature, we are by no means bird-watching enthusiasts, but we got a kick out of seeing people take \\"enjoyment of birds\\" to a whole new level.  Ultimately, the movie is about life and the choices you make, and that a life without Regrets is one lived with Balance.
B000069HKH|5.0|My favourite Springsteen CD has always been \\"Wild and Innocent\\" but I feel this CD may be his best ever. I pretty much thought of Bruce as a busted flush after Lucky Town and then the series of \\"mumble records\\" like Nebraska, Tom Joad and Devils and Dust. The Rising has passion, great songs and commitment and a truckload of variety. Is there an artist of equal stature who would attempt a song as controversial and unusual as Paradise? One downer for me is the drumming of Weinberg: BANG, BANG, BANG!!!! No light and shade, Bruce sacked Vini Lopez for wayward tempi after \\"Wild and Innocent but even a cursory listen to \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" showed how much more sensitive he was than this clubber. Weinberg used to have more variety but I have heard drum machines play with more artistry than this. 9/11 obviously lit a fire under Bruce and shows what a difference it makes when an artist really has something to say. What a difference to all the \\"artists\\" of today, most of whom do little more than dance around in their underpants, screeching in front of a wind machine.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I've gotta admit.... when I.first got this cd I listened to it everyday ....pretty good cd all around. I love the mix of r and b and hip hop. Drake's my dude.  Banging!!!!!

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I never did like captain america. I gotta say tho I never really knew the guys character either. Now I've changed my mind all because of this movie (I still think he needs to lose that hat). It's all in the name. I love the new uniform (shown on the front cover.). It's got action, it's got romance, and it's got feeling. What else could I ask for from this movie? Well there is one thing but I'd spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet if I said anything so I'll keep it to myself. Let's just say the ending is alittle sad... for those of you whov'e seen it you'll know what I'm talking about. Anyway it's a great movie and a must have if you plan on buying all the Marvel series. I know I definitely am. Marvel just keeps getting better. I recommend buying this movie. Especially if you like Marvel movies. I can't wait till the Avengers comes out.<br /><br />Update: Avengers is out! OMG it was amazing. A strongly recommeded must see! If you missed it in theatres DO NOT MISS IT ON BLU-RAY/ DVD.

B006UG90RM|4.0|Because they sure don't play as if three of their members are pushing 60. In that context, I really am puzzled why anyone would give this album less than four stars - it is a solid effort, all things considered, in the least.  No, it is not 'Fair Warning', and true, Roth's vocals, questionable as they were to begin with, are not the same. And yes, it is very glaring now how much Michael Anthony's vocals were an important part of their sound.  But in no manner should this take away from the fact this album is a solid effort. So great to see Diamond Dave back, swagger and all, and it only goes to show that his presence pushes Eddie back to form.  And so what if these tracks are culled from demos from early days? All the better, I say, because the beauty in these songs is [with the exception of perhaps the horrid Tattoo and 2 others] how seamlessly they integrate into the existing catalog.  I am not going into a track-by-track review of this album, solely because it is a subjective exercise at best. Draw your own conclusions, but after 3 listens I'm an admitted addict.  Just take this little nugget of advice with you: If you are a 'Van Hagar' fan, you will be sorely dissappointed. If you expect the band to have the same 'oomph' as they did in their 20's, all I can say is that I would like to see how well YOU fare at the same age, sitting in front of the television set, wasting your life away, and when no one is listening or around to see you, you cry out loud how you wish you could be doing something so well at that age.  Rock on, Dave/Alex/Eddie and Wolfgang!!! Rock on!!!  Prost!!

The plot thickens and I'm loving every minute of this excellent entertainment.

B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Considering all the praise that's been heaped upon it--not to mention Oscar nominations and other awards--\\"The Help\\" left me feeling rather ambivalent. Yes, it features some \\"very important\\" themes and it begs to be called a \\"movie about issues\\" (namely, racism and women's rights). And yes, the actors deliver fine performances--Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career--certainly better than anything she did in that \\"Twilight: Eclipse\\" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment, despite the strong performances of its cast, and I'll be thoroughly perplexed if it wins any Oscars at all.

B000I0QM04|5.0|As a boy growing up in the 1930's I can still vividly remember my excitement on Saturday mornings as my dad would take me to our local theater for the Saturday morning fun club. There would be a feature film plus a shorter cliff-hanger serial that would leave the hero in a life threatening situation which was not resolved until the next installment the following Saturday morning.<br /><br />It was there I saw my first Buck Rogers serial and I was hooked for life on science fiction. It was not until the Second World War that I would discover sci-fi pulp magazines. The Boy Scouts would collect waste paper for the war effort and I discovered science fiction pulp magazines; I was so excited by that discovery that I would keep every copy that came my way and read and re-read them.<br /><br />My wife tells me that when we married one of the few things I owned was my treasured collection of sci-fi pulp magazines; sadly they somehow disappeared as some of those are now worth a lot of money.<br /><br />I mention that because this movie reminded me of that era and those serials and those pulp magazines. The magazines always had lurid covers of space ships, heroes, villains, and space monsters enough to satisfy the imagination of almost any young boy. This movie does a marvelous job of capturing the emotions generated by those magazines and movies.<br /><br />It communicated powerfully with my memories of those times and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Although there are fewer of us now, if you are one who can share my memories of that bygone era, I encourage you to get this movie. If you're of a younger generation and can free your imagination I suspect you'll be able to enjoy it too.<br /><br />For the record I'm still a dedicated sci-fi fan and enjoy an extensive collection of books and movies.

B001GQSY64|4.0|I'd avoided The Clone Wars for years because of all of the negative reviews. Having come in with lower expectations, I think I enjoyed the movie more. To be sure, it's not great, but it's not horrible. The plot is pretty ridiculous - Jabba's son is kidnapped and the Jedi must rescue him (really, the same Jabba who had Han frozen in Carbonite?). However, the animation is pretty good overall. It's not Pixar, but it does look like Star Wars.  There isn't much character development - Clone Wars is mostly an action film. Despite that, I really do like the relationship between Anakin and his new padawan, Ashoka Tano. Ashoka is a brilliant character whose wisecracking ways fits Anakin perfectly. Obi-Wan isn't as much of a presence, but he gets a fun scene near the beginning. Amidala only plays a small but important role near the end.  Overall, I wish the movie had a plot with more substance and more intimate moments with the main characters. That said, it's certainly not as bad as many reviewers claimed. If you like Star Wars, give it a chance.

1401924751|5.0|I purchased this deck because the D. Virtue oracle decks get so many wonderful reviews. I also appreciate their positive messages. I am familiar with tarot and I must say the Oracle cards are much more user friendly even for beginners. The deck came to me on time and in great condition. Although the lid is difficult to remove, it makes me confident the box will keep its longevity and the cards won't take any unexpected spills. The first night I had the deck I did a read on myself as well as my husband. I had a couple of friends going through a hard time so I did readings for them as well. The most common thing I heard from everyone was \\"Wow, that's so weird...\\" as they began to tell me how the card was accurate because of a certain event or subject they had been contemplating. If you're looking for a very accurate deck regardless of skill level, I would highly recommend this one.
0062082353|3.0|He is the deadliest American sniper ever, called \\"the devil\\" by the enemies he hunted and \\"the legend\\" by his Navy SEAL brothers . . .<br /><br />From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most career sniper kills in United States military history. The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him al-Shaitan (\\"the devil\\") and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle's masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time.<br /><br />American Sniper: The Autobiography of The Most Lethal Sniper in US Military History by Chris Kyle<br /><br />I received this book for my review only with no monetary interest provided by William Morrow, a division of Harper Collins Publishers for my written expressed review.<br /><br />American Sniper is one story of just one man who had an incredible journey during the war in Iraq/Afghanistan. While I am so honored and proud of Chris Kyle defending not only Americans in Iraq and the surrounding areas, but other military members as well. I can't help but read between the pages to see see his wife struggling to raise their first child by herself. With Chris contemplating a second tour and re-enlisting for another 4-5 years of being deployed back to Iraq, his Wife is left with a feeling of loss and anger towards her husband for not putting his wife and family first. Chris has done some amazing things by being a SEAL! Things that many of us Americans could not even fathom having to deal with. Chris has my utmost respect and admiration for helping to protect the American ideals that make our country great. What I don't particularly like is how he put his country over his wife and children when coming up on his 2nd tour. With a wife and child at home and another on the way, he decides to re-enlist for another dangerous deployment that could end his life and leave his wife without a husband and his children without a father.<br /><br />I have to take the side of his wife after his first tour that he should not have re-enlisted to be with his wife and family. He served his country with honor and saved many lives, while at the same time killing so many terrorists that threatened any type of life in Iraq. After his first tour however, he was plagued by thoughts of not being their for his fellow soldiers that he forgot the most important rule in life. To be a loving father and husband, for that is what is truly will be remembered by the ones you love and whom you will depend on in life. Yes he has many memories as a sniper and has remained very close to other SEAL's throughout his life, but it is his wife and children that will make him the man that he is.<br /><br />I would rate this book a 3 out of 5 stars. I would rate this book higher, but I felt that his patriotism truly leads his life over his family. God, family, country is how it should be. Thank you Chris Kyle for your service and your pride for America. Now take the time to have a happy and fulfilling relationship with your wife and children. God Bless you!t his country over his wife and children when coming up on his 2nd tour.

B005I4JG80|5.0|The thought of reading a parenting book is not always a pleasant one but this was an insightful, effortless, and often funny read. I couldn't put the book down. Although research is dutifully cited, the anecdotal tone of the book feels like a personal and inspiring journey of slowing coming to understand a culture that does not view parents as sacrificial animals and kids as irrational beings that constantly need to be nannied. Rather the book demonstrates in a personal tone the value of mutual respect. Eventually parents enjoy raising  rational, well-rounded independent individuals with their own tastes and opinions. The only down side is the horrible advice on breastfeeding for young mothers ( 4 feedings a day after 3 months!) and the lack of serious criticism of a country with dismal breastfeeding rates but that can easily be overlooked because the book is otherwise brilliant.

0307888908|5.0|Reid Hoffman, who is less well known than other Silicon Valley icons like Zuckerberg or Jobs, has been called \\"*the* role model for entrepreneurs\\" by tech publications, and for very good reason. He's a hugely successful investor who not only has had a hand in some of the most successful tech companies around today (including Zuckerberg's Facebook) but is also a hugely successful entrepreneur and founder - an incredibly rare achievement in today's tech world. He's currently chairman and co-founder of the professional networking site LinkedIn and was an executive at PayPal.  Ben Casnocha is an intensely curious young author. Anyone familiar with his extensive online writing and earlier book, My Start-Up Life, knows the quality of insight he provides. That voice certainly shines through in this book. Not only is he a true intellectual, he also has the business experience as a founder of his own software company to be able to write authoritatively on a topic like this.  Speaking of that topic, careers and career development is one of the most broad topics one can imagine, and considering the breadth of topics and points these two cover, the book is remarkably coherent and engaging. References to LinkedIn and how to use it effectively are tactfully sprinkled throughout the book and do not dominate the bulk of the discussion.  Two of the key threads:  - Relationships are the most important aspect of one's career.  The authors use a brilliant analogy for thinking about one's relationships: I-to-the-We. Your individual strengths matter, but when surrounded by the right individuals, your ability to effect change is raised exponentially by the power of your network.   A refreshing change from typical business books, the authors show how to build genuine relationships that benefit both individuals. They stress helping first and not keeping score.  This idea is epitomized by the little-known story that Hoffman actually introduced Mark Zuckerberg to Facebook's first outside investor and himself (Hoffman) invested in the very first round of financing. Facebook, for now, has the greater market cap and the larger member base. Their respective companies are often pitted against each other in the media, and Hoffman's willingness to help a young Zuckerberg building a competing social network shows Hoffman's commitment to follow his own advice.  - Have a bias towards action.  Straight out of the Silicon Valley playbook, this seems incredibly obvious once you hear the rationale, but is certainly not standard practice for folks in their careers today. As the pace of change accelerates all around you, if you're not moving forward, then you are in essence moving backwards.  Simply doing things, when you're guided by your best instincts, generates opportunities, new connections and most of all, helps you learn about yourself. Instead of thinking about whether you want to make a move to another industry, get out there and talk to the folks in that industry or take a small and reversible step in that direction by working in that industry on the side, testing your \\"strong hypothesis, weakly held\\" to see if it is in fact right for you.  To further this focus on action and to help the reader in his or her own career journey, the authors end each chapter with a section titled Invest In Yourself. It provides many eminently useful \\"action items\\" that the reader should take to implement the ideas in the book. Many business and self-help books falter when it comes time to turn ideas into action but these sections are a cut above the tired and obvious action items present in many books.  Overall, this is a hugely refreshing and remarkably coherent career book. Thoroughly researched and backed up by real-world examples, this is a must-read for anyone interested in advancing their career in today's working world.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book.I have read in years! I could not put it down. I immediately purchased the second and third book. All 5 star books with suspense and a twists and a romantic triangle. Great books!
B005ELZNH0|5.0|Well... I have to say, this far exceeded my expectations. If you don't have this music.... you could not get a better intro. Even if you do have it, this is worth picking up at this ridiculously low price. The box is sturdy and solid and handsome, and the individual facsimile jackets are made of nice, thick, coated stock and look GREAT. The sound is excellent, and most discs have extra tracks. Other reviewers have listed the various albums here, which include most of Davis' landmark studio recordings for Columbia. If you get your copy of the box from one of the \\"affiliated sellers\\" you will be paying well under two dollars apiece for these discs. Even at the \\"official\\" price this is a steal. No kidding. There is also an excellent booklet -- \\"perfect bound,\\" not stapled -- with photos, track listings and details.... This is a classy production all the way. What a great surprise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hesitant to read the third book because such negative reviews and was afraid of disappointment. I am relieved that I did! If you loved the first 2 give it a try! I needed closure and got what I hoped would happen. I have never been sucked into another world the second I would start reading. It keeps you wanting more on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />I understand it was a disappoint that katniss did not kill Snow, but I guess I saw it more as she killed the one who would follow more in Snow's footsteps rather than allow complete freedom. She stopped the tourment of the future and I think she knew Snow was dying;the man was coughing up blood. She had to choose one to take down and I could not agree more with her decision!<br /><br />As for the Peeta and Gale! I was thrilled she ended up with Peeta and having his children. From the beginning she said she never wanted kids because of the games, with that elimated she was able to consider that possibility and make it a reality!<br /><br />I never once thought that Katniss went soft in the third book. She went through hell and back. Her breakdowns and factor that she did need others to heal her just states she is human. She is a 17-year-old girl fighting and leading a rebellion with people on both side wanting her dead.

B004EPYZTE|4.0|I liked the movie, but I can see where others may not. I bought the 3D version because I am addicted to 3D. The 3D in this film did not satisfy my hunger. There were two, maybe three, places where you would say... \\"That looks cool\\"! That was it. Most of it didn't even look like it was filmed in 3D.  So if the 3D version cost more... don't buy it! The Blu Ray will give you the same amount of entertainment
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I've been following the author's blog (susan kiernan-lewis.wordpress.com) and now checked out the book. Beware, this could be an expensive read...you'll want to go to France based on the beginning. I loved her descriptions. Her style takes a little getting used to as she has sudden chapter changes, and I can say I did not guess the storyline or see the surprises. It was well done. I look forward to the next book. Worth the money and time to read. A trip to France...maybe not.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not being a reader of young adult books, I knew very little of this book until I saw the movie trailer and read the sample pages on Amazon. I was stunned to find a book that was more than just for young adults. In fact, I think most adults can and will enjoy this book.  What was hardest for me was that I grew up in an area much like \\"the Seam\\" and was taught by my grandmother many of the survival skills that Katniss learned. So much of this book rang so true to the life I had before leaving for college that it overwhelmed me. And, like Katniss, I lost family to the coal mines.  The book may seem a futuristic view of what the world could become to some who read it, but to me, it was as if I were reading about parts of my own life. I can't recommend the book enough and I look forward to reading the sequels.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|I saw this film in theaters and have loved it since. I watched it for the first time on Bluray last night and midway through the film it stopped playing. The Bluray version has known issues due to copy protection implemented by 20th Century Fox. My Bluray player is only 2 months old but The Day After Tomorrow is over 4 years old so outdated firmware isn't the issue.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|After years of having to choose between smaller so-so performing CPU fan/heatsinks or paying nearly the price of a CPU for a larger CPU cooler, Cooler Master finally releases a 120mm cooler for the masses who want a good level of performance without the exorbitant price.  You can't get better cooling for the 20 bucks these are often priced at.  Installed it on a previously hot running Phenom II 920, dangerously high load temps (using Coretemp) of 60C now hover at 50C or lower with Intelburntest even with CPU now overclocked from 2.8ghz to 3.2ghz.  The price is so low I even installed one on an older recently acquired hot running Intel e6400, overclocking it from 2.1ghz to 3.2ghz with load Intelburntest temps staying in the low 60's.  For comparison, with the stock cooler, the E6400 would rise to nearly 80C load at STOCK cpu speeds/voltage regardless of how many times I reinstalled the old cooler; even trying an old q6600 cooler.  If you're not particularly interested in overclocking; the cooler can be very quiet using the PWM CPU fan option in motherboard bios and still keep the CPU cool or you can just use your own 120mm fan.  Box even comes with secondary fan installation kit and plenty of thermal compound for several applications which does the job just fine (I've used arctic silver 5 and the difference is negligible).  Very versatile installation compatibility with so many socket types is great too.  Great product that's comparable to coolers two to three times its price.

B0072OFM28|3.0|So....Im really not feeling this new guy Liam.  I honestly havent gotten into this season at all.  And I love Spartacus, was hooked from the beginning(Ive got many collectibles, from autographs to trading cards and tote bags,lol.  However this new season is just ehhh.  Not feeling it.  I couldnt even finish watching the 1st or second episode.  The actor from what I can see is no wheres near the physical shape Andy Whitfield was in.  Hes taller and just kinda ackwardish really.  He also doesnt seem masculine enough for the role.  He seems very weak compared to Andy and doesnt seem to take charge as well.  But this is just my opinion.  I just dont think I can get into this new season.  I saw about 1/2 of the first episode, part of the second and all of the 3rd and he just doesnt seem to be leader like in this one.  I dont know.......Just my thoughts....Wish they could have found a better actor in my opinion.  They could have put more effort into the story too.  They totally rushed into finding a new actor....Let me  know if any of you has similar thought to mine...

B00518HBD0|5.0|I have been a 3DD fan since 2005, when \\"Let Me Go\\" came out.  I fell for the vocals so after buying that record, I couldn't get enough of this band.  With all of the artificial music that you hear nowadays, this is one band that stays true to itself and doesn't conform to anyone else.  Being as this is the fifth record, all they really did was evolve, and that's jusst fine.  Brad's voice has gotten much deeper (not to mention better), yet he can still maintain those high notes.  This is a rarity, but there was not one song that I did not like.  This is exactly how great 3DD is!  Although I do have favorites, it was nice to hear faster, more uptempo numbers (such as \\"Believer\\" and the title track).  Brad always writes inspirational and sometimes devil may care lyrics (see \\"Race For The Sun\\" and \\"On The Run\\") and turns his head against the haters (see \\"My Way\\", \\"Back To Me\\" and \\"What's Left\\").  That's Brad for ya, he tells it like it is!  However, the knockout song of the day was \\"Everytime You Go.\\"  I heard a clip when the record first came out and I knew that I already loved the song.  So when I finally made the time to listen to the whole record, I just loved it that much more.  My other favorite, uplifting track was \\"Heaven.\\"  It sure hits the heart, doesn't it??  The reason that 3DD continues to stand out is because they are just soulful, period.  They are creating an important legacy for fans to enjoy forever.  Well, I don't know how they can top this record, but when the time comes, I sure can't wait to find out!  So if you are looking for an authentic band to listen to -- either at home or in the car -- do not look any further than 3DD.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I heard Rolling in the Deep on the radio months ago & never realized who sung it until I heard the grammy nominations. I listened to the clips of the other songs on this album & decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. Her voice is beautiful. I am not disappointed in this CD at all.
0061537969|5.0|I admit I was very skeptical about this book because it is written from a dog's perspective. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. I loved the characters from the very beginning and found myself on a roller-coaster of emotions throughout the book. Warning, it can be a tear-jerker in places so it may not be a good idea to read it in public or on the plane like I did!<br /><br />Even if you don't normally like very emotional stories, I recommend this book. It offers a great deal of insight into human character.

B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Bought the original cassette back in the late '70's. Played through my Craig Road Rated 6x9's on the back dash of an Olds Delta '88 had heavy kick butt bass, somewhat mirky highs with dominant \\"hummy\\" mid-range. Couldn't crank it up too far back then without clipping. Lived with it! What could you do about it as a 20 something back then?! I was told I needed to buy a more expensive sound system for my car. So sorry! No money!<br /><br />Somewhere in the '90's I bought the CD version and noticed the echoey sound to the drums and vocals with an overall crispier and brighter timbre. Lived with it! What could you do as a 40 something back then?!<br /><br />Pulled the trigger on the 2006 Rhino version CD from the reviews here and they're all correct. It's like I got a brand new, beefier sound system. I played both CD versions on my 1992 Technics home CD player through my 1972 Sansui amp and 1984 Norman Lab Model 82 speakers and the sound of the Rhino version is about 6-9 decibels louder with fuller bass and more natural sounding to the way I remember it back in the early '80's. I thought it was the 6x9's that were making it sound that way.<br /><br />Just to be specific so you know which one to get the UPC number on the 2006 Rhino version I have is...(small number zero) 8122 78966 2 (small number one). The one I got that I believe is a 1988 produced or mixed in Germany is (small number zero) 7599-27381-2 (small number five).<br /><br />But it's easy to tell them apart here at Amazon because the Rhino version has added three live performances that sound like CRAP! Really! They were unlistenable on my home stereo system.<br /><br />Oh well...LIVE WITH IT! What can you do about it as a 50 something!<br /><br />And you wonder why everyone wants to steal music by downloading and distributing it online. LIVE WITH IT!
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|so back in the day i had the first two mr big cd's and liked, not loved them. there were a few killer tunes, but the albums as a whole each had too many 'meh' songs... i actually did not like the one HUGE hit 'to be with you' at all... so i have ignored their other cd's... but at some point last year i picked this one up after hearing 'undertow' on their website. this album has been on heavy rotation ever since. it puts me in such a good mood and every song just cooks. there aren't any cringe-worthy lyrics, i like every track, and LOVE quite a few. i have also passed this along to several friends who have responded in kind.  my one MINOR complaint is billy sheehan's bass tone. there's no question he's an awesome player, but i find his tone wierd. it sits well in the mixes when everyone is together, (maybe that's why he likes the tone) but as soon as he's soloing and it's way out front, it sounds odd.  BUT! THANK YOU mr big for one of my favorite albums of the year. i'm now going to start investigating the others i've never heard...

1451627289|3.0|I enjoyed how extremely descriptive King wrote of the country in the years leading up to Kennedy's assassination.  However, the ending was at best a let down.  While reading it seemed to me that someone else had written the ending and in the post notes, King mentioned his son supplied the ending to the novel.  If I wanted to read what his son had written, I would have bought a book by him.  The ending of this book was way too predictable as well as poorly written.  King should go back and re-write the last 10% of the book and supply that ending to all that purchased the book.

B0045HCJKS|4.0|Michael Crichton's debut film begins with a great science fiction concept; near-future theme parks with life-like robots programmed to satisfy the customers' every whim and hedonistic desire.  However, at the turning point, when the creators of the theme parks loose control of the life-like androids, Crichton's directing becomes rather campy; he hadn't yet figured out how to effectivly pace and film suspense/horror scenes for maximum effect.  Regardless, the true value of this film lies in the fact that it was a ground breaking prototype for subsequent blockbuster films (e.g., Halloween, Terminator, Logan's Run).  Without question, Yul Brynner as the murderous \\"WesternWorld\\" robot gunslinger was a great choice for the film.  Speaking only a handful of scripted lines, Brynner's brilliance shines through in his physical comportment and his facial expressions (or, mainly, the lack of them); Brynner's methodically paced yet determined pursuit of protagonist Richard Benjamin was very influential in the development of colossal film characters such as \\"Michael Myers\\" and of Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the \\"terminator.\\"  As stated by director John Carpenter,\\"if one goes back and looks at Westworld, that picture involved a robot gunfighter that keeps coming back again and again. I copied a bit of that idea and added it to a horror film on Halloween night with teenagers. To make Michael Myers frightening, I had him walk like a man, not a monster.\\" Also significant to the film was its (at the time) groundbreaking use of \\"digital image processing\\"; pixilated photo imagery that simulated Brynner's android point of view, and his ability to \\"see\\" differences in thermal activity.  This concept seems to have been borrowed and enhanced in the subsequent film PREDATOR where, as in WestWorld, the use of thermal sensory in order to track prey, becomes a primary element.

0446547654|2.0|I usually love everything Nicholas Sparks writes. However, I did not really like this book. I did not particularly like the characters. The plot has too many really dramatic coincidences. There is too much violence. This was not his best book.

0307888908|5.0|I've read my fair share of career books. While each takes its own angle on the whole \\"job\\" thing, I find that oftentimes I get most annoyed in the section where authors - typically, at least - say \\"OK now, the first thing you need to do is follow your passion!\\" Luckily, this book takes an entirely different approach.<br /><br />In the start-up of you, Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha give a framework for how to think about your career. This framework, obviously, is adapted from the start-up world. The strategies that start-ups use to survive can also be used for individuals to survive (especially given the current state of our economy). And, because of this framework, the question isn't \\"what do you really, with all of your heart, want to do?\\" (which I appreciate, because how many people really have a good answer to that question?) The questions are: what are you good at? What resources do you have at your disposal (could be money, connections, location, etc)? What are the needs in the market? These are the same questions that start-ups must ask as they get going and pivot as needed.<br /><br />I actually used these questions when I myself was looking for a job. Rather than staring at my computer screen thinking \\"hmmmmm maybe I could be a botanist?\\" I made lists of people I knew, their positions and their companies, and worked from there. This helped me map out my network and see what resources I had at my disposal, people-wise.<br /><br />But these aren't just strategies for how to survive, they're strategies for how to thrive. Each chapter contains numerous stories of ultra-successful people from SIlicon Valley and how they used an entrepreneurial attitude to get where they are. And I'll give you a hint: none of them applied to jobs through Craigslist.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Every year, there are a handful of films that enter and leave theaters very quietly, then pop up out of nowhere to appear all over critics' year-end lists. Take Shelter premiered last year at Sundance and ran the festival circuit, picking up a handful of awards along the way, before opening in limited release back in September. Though it failed to make enough money to recoup its already modest $5 million budget, critics raved about the film and its central performance by Michael Shannon. Shannon plays Curtis LaForche, an Ohio family man who begins dreaming about an apocalyptic storm. Deciding at first to keep the dreams to himself, Curtis pours all of his energy into building a storm shelter in his back yard; his obsession with the shelter eventually strains all the meaningful relationships in his life. A piece of subtle, nuanced filmmaking, I feel Michael Shannon's performance alone made the film worth seeing, but the film itself is a perfect blend of drama and dread. It's a slow-burn psychological mindbender that builds tension gradually, so it's not for everyone, but you can be sure you'll be witnessing some top notch filmmaking if you watch it.

B006ISJQ1W|3.0|In 2011, 13 years after first portraying a Hunter S. Thompson doppelganger in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Johnny Depp took on two roles that referenced the controversial writer: one by way of an animated chameleon that took its cues from Fear and Loathing's Raoul Duke, and the other by way of an adaptation of Thompson's semi-autobiographical debut novel, The Rum Diary. While the former was considered a success, the latter, unfortunately, split critics in much the same way that Fear and Loathing did. The Rum Diary follows journalist Paul Kemp as he travels to Puerto Rico to write for a local paper. While there, Paul is tasked with writing a favorable story about an American entrepreneur intent on exploiting the island for commercial gain, and Paul must contemplate the murky moral nature of the piece. I felt that Depp was as committed to the role as ever, and that the film was colorful and amiable enough, but I was also a bit put off by the rambling source material, which made for an unfocused narrative. Fans of both Thompson and Depp may enjoy the flick, but there are no guarantees here.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen's  \\"Old Ideas\\" is nothing less than a musical Masterpiece. I was introduced to his music very recently by other reviewers right here on Amazon and i am more than grateful for it........As soon as i heard his voice for the first time a bit before the Christmas holidays, i just knew i would love his music,  not only he is  a real artist but he is also respected  and praised by others in the business  as well, like Lou Reed and Bob Dylan and other very talented music icons.<br /><br />I quickly started researching and digging to see if this could get even better and it did......In a few weeks i was able to  fully appreciate the solidity and Openness of his song writing which is not only brilliant but also very real...sometimes too real and even shocking..... The \\"New Skin For The Old Ceremony\\" album was the first one i got and after listening to it i can honestly say i immediately wanted more.... i quickly got his first album \\"Songs Of Leonard Cohen\\", the outstanding \\"Im Your Man\\", the almost perfect \\"The Future\\", Ten New  Songs, Death of a Ladies Man, Songs from the Road, Dear Heather and finally just bought my copy of \\"Old Ideas\\" and here i am.......completely hooked.......and at a  loss for words....<br /><br />The songs are mostly slow but extremely rich with beautiful arrangements, compelling melodies and killer song writing. Leonard's voice is very deep, soothing and indescribably beautiful.....It is the voice of a man who lived life to the fullest, with good moments in his life, as well as bad moments, excess  and regrets too.....i think that is what Leonard is sharing with us when he's writing......it is the ultimate voice of knowledge and wisdom.....some of those songs got me quite emotional......<br /><br />The sound quality is amazing. We can easily hear everything that's going on and some of those arrangements are just gorgeous. The whole record is excellent and can easily be played from start to finish, no need to skip tracks. The highlights of this record for me personally would be the wonderful \\"Show Me The Place\\", The angelic \\"Come Healing\\" and the amazing, lazy-groovy \\"Banjo\\" song. Really cant get enough of those.....<br />Overall, if you like Leonard's music, i would say this one is an \\"essential\\" album for you to get. I think Leonard is still a ladies man......the songs are amazing and his voice is better than ever. Don't hesitate, just get it.......you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />Personal recommendation: Play it very loud or use headphones to enjoy even more.....<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!ly would be the wonderful \\"Show Me The Place\\", The angelic \\"Come Healing\\" and the amazing, lazy-groovy \\"Banjo\\" song.

B000WS4PCO|5.0|Suddenly I had, through the courtesy of a gift card, a copy of what is (arguably) U2's most universally acclaimed recording, \\"The Joshua Tree\\", the first time I'd ever owned this release on CD, after at least two versions of the officially released tape had been worn down to ribbons and levitated away in particulate. Although I'd purchased it the day of its release in 1987 and it was nearly always in the dash of my Corolla's cassette player, by the time I'd gotten hold of the CD version I hadn't listened to it in in probably close to ten years. And boy howdy, what a revelation it turned out to be, with a sense of depth and nuance my ears just weren't able to register from listening to it on cassette, bringing to me, at least, a new level of clarity toward what I already regarded as U2's most cohesive release.<br /><br />Raw, churning, and aggressive, with a bristly, expansive, almost infinite guitar sound, \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" is the only track from \\"The Joshua Tree\\" that isn't internally consistent with the remainder of the CD, which unites the anthemic, lively vitality of \\"Boy\\", \\"October\\", and \\"War\\" with the experimental ambience of its immediate predecessor, \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", and the incorporation of stylistic elements from folk, blues, country,  gospel, and a tinge of western Americana to create something heavily textural, timeless and familiar, immediate, and yet rooted in the distinctive harmonics consistent with the band's previous musical trajectory. Sounding out the most universally familiar elements associated with their previous musical arrangements, \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" re-introduces us to the heavily resonant elemental bassline Adam Clayton uses to anchor the bottom end, the loping percussive work of Larry Mullen,Jr that merges in tandem with it, and The Edge's delayed, heavily processed, infinitely fragmenting guitar line, but this time it emerges from the soaring ambience of a cathedral-like tone of a synthesizer in a fully-realized, conventionally structured song patiently building over the course of almost the first two minutes into an explosive crescendo before Bono delivers an impassioned plea for a place where there is no sense of separation and demarcation, but universal embracement instead. Indeed, the production values bring a sense of balance and restraint to songs that could just as easily have gone  from the start in the direction of sustained, explosive release or the unwinding martial excitement of their anthemic material; witness the integration of acoustic guitar into tracks such as \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"Running To Stand Still\\" \\"In God's Country\\", or \\"Exit\\", the first two levelly ascending, the third faster in tempo but not at the level of explosive crescendo, and the last, with its added eerie, pulsating atmospherics, reaching sustained explosive release.  The rhythmically insistent  \\"With Or Without You\\" and elegiac \\"One Tree Hill\\" nestle their fluidly progressing guitar lines and percussive flourishes within a rich bed of synthesized ambience.<br /><br />\\"The Joshua Tree\\" has its moments of political commentary, but if \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" is removed from the equation, they aren't in the nature of utter polemically-charged jeremiads; \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" mourns the decline of a community that once was closely knit but coming unraveled through severe economic upheaval; \\"Running To Stand Still\\" explores the negative impact of the drug trade no matter in which marginalized community it's situated within through the eyes of an addict. \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\", the sublime closing track, separates the victims of brutal regimes in the Southern Hemisphere into a mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive category away from their persecutors, their dignity celebrated while assignation of blame is made implicit rather than explicit to keep the focus on those who were removed and the ones who mourn them, the musical arrangement of the track itself builtaround a simple melody plucked out on acoustic guitar,simple bassline, rudimentary percussion, the explosive plash of a looping drone, and a haunting, atmospheric keyboard line that build toward an explosive crescendo, literally ending \\"The Joshua Tree\\" on a high note.<br /><br />Some critics have already revised their opinion with regard to the overall strength and cohesion of \\"The Joshua Tree\\", finding it dated, cliched, and wanting. I'm not someone who agrees with that interpretation. An inevitable backlash resulted as this release catapulted U2 to the status as being possibly not only the most universally recognized band in the world, but also one with a sense of passion, intensity, and conviction that had not been as strongly realized in years. That backlash occurred as the band became infatuated not only with translating the sound of American music for ears outside of North America, but also lecturing Americans on the impact their government's policies were having on the world, and that sense of appropriation coupled with their approbation triggered a long second look at the band. For me this release is a proposition that exists within a level bubble through which none of that intrudes, and I submit to you that it's their finest moment, and one well worth getting.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|My title says it all.  With 1000+ reviews I won't say anything that hasn't already been said in much greater detail.  I simply want to add my vote for the record and to balance out the astounding 5 star reviews (those have to be from friends,relatives and publishers).  This fourth book is a major disappointment if you were expecting a continuation of the plot lines from the first three books.  Instead, it lays the groundwork for new characters in what appears to be a never-ending series and speads waaaay too much time on Cersei.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The cassette player itself is fragile and feels like it will break apart at the slightest pressure. I followed instructions and connected to my computer. The first track did not have any major issues. Came back to do more the next day and there were all kinds of issues with the equipment. It was not recognized by the computer ... tried a second computer, was recognized, but the sound quality of the track was low and severely distorted. The play button is not stable and if you press it, it does funny things to the track. Overall a cheap device ... not worth the price.

B005LAIGP0|4.0|Forget all the nonsense surrounding this being Daniel Radcliffe's first film outside of the mega franchise that is Harry Potter. Yes Radcliffe is in the movie and does a serviceable job in the role of Arthur Kipps but everything to me exists out of Radcliffe and to speak of him does disservice to the best component of the movie, that being James Watkins the director who creates and excellent amount of suspense over trying to use musical stings or jump scares to hit his audience. This isn't a classic haunted house film like Robert Wise's The Haunting or The Shining but its a fun little film with a flaw holding it back from greatness.<br />I mention Radcliffe only in saying that every actor in the film outside of acting talent which they have seems more to have been cast for their faces. Its odd seeing Radcliffe playing a father sure, but Kipps isn't a character like Jack Torrance. Radcliffe main use in the film is to either appear haunted or scared which He does well. He's joined by the excellent Ciaran Hinds playing a local landowner who doesn't believe all this woman in black nonsense despite having a mentally unstable wife played by Janet Mcteer.<br />The Woman in Black herself is a beautiful creation, a ethereal image that plays like English Freddy Krueger, a vengeful spirit who causes the death of children when she's seen in the town of Crythin Gifford, gathering the spirits of her victims around her as sort of a haunting troupe.<br />As I said the real star of the film is James Watkins not to take anything from the work of the cinematographer or production designer. Watkins does pepper the film with jump scares from the Woman's screech to a bird in a chimney but He also tries the approach of John Carpenter in Halloween with hidden glimpses of the woman over the shoulder of a character or moments of an agitated dog to signal her coming. The film does use sound to create more measured bits of suspense included a bit lifted Susan Hill's novel involving a rocking chair behind a locked room and it works well. Then there's the house on Eel Marsh itself is a beautiful creation in keeping with the period setting of the film, a reclusive decaying mansion surrounded by marshes and a tide that cuts it off from town in order to strand Radcliffe.<br />It all adds up to a really good horror film, one with a dark edge to its action and one worth seeing in theatres to get the experience from the sights and sounds created to drive the suspense. There's just one true negative for me and that's the ending of the movie perhaps put in the film for Radcliffe's star power, or perhaps the result of negative testing. Hopefully not spoiling the end at one point the movie seems to go for a dark ending only to have some bit of happy schmaltz that tries to lighten the mood and doesn't work at all. Watkins previous film Eden Lake contained a twisted bit of glumness in its finale so it feels like something to fit with the fact that the movie has Harry Potter in the lead. Thankfully though for me one minute of blandness didn't kill a great ninety minutes that preceded it.<br />The disc from Sony Pictures doesn't have much in the way of great extras for fans of the film relying on an EPK making of and a bit about Daniel Radcliffe. Susan Hill pops up for a bit in the making of but the best bit bonus is a commentary from Watkins and Jane Goldman. What the disc has going for it is a superb audio visual package that works for the film. As I've said this beautiful looking ghost film where most of what drives the film are the images and the sound. Sure you could make a game out of all the scary sounds that are trotted out but there are other moments like a scene in a bog covered in fog that work well.<br />For fans of gothic horror films and ghost stories this is a recommended disc an excellent highlight for the format.

0307959856|4.0|Six years after the close of Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennet is happily ensconced at Pemberley, where she lives with her beloved husband Fitzwilliam Darcy, their two sons and Darcy's sister Georgiana.  With her sister Jane nearby, Elizabeth couldn't ask for a better life.  It's thrown into turmoil, however, when a man is killed on the estate the night before the Darcy's annual ball.  The prime suspect is the dastardly Wickham, Elizabeth's brother-in-law and former suitor as well as Darcy's nemesis.  Though the two couples have been estranged since Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth, they are thrown together into the mystery and Darcy finds himself in the unwonted position of champion for Wickham's innocence.  He struggles with his own personal feelings against Wickham as he tries to ensure that justice is done and the true murderer is revealed.  Will he be able to restore peace and harmony to his home or will those things vanish like illusions forever, lost to the black stain that Wickham - and possibly others - throw onto the family's purity?<br /><br />Fans of Jane Austen who are willing to accept a very good yet not perfect recreation of her voice, characters and plot will enjoy this interesting twist on the P&P story.  Refreshing reminders of the original story and interesting glimpses into the characters of the main players added to a relatively straightforward mystery all make up for an entertaining read that, though it won't satisfy the purist Jane Austen fans around, will delight most readers looking for a nice combination of social novel and historical mystery!

Only her bosses and coworkers don't see it that way. She get a chance to prove herself. There is a vey important client she is to meet with, simple. No, she drifts into her mind-scape of dreams and loses focus. When she realizes what happening she bumbles and has to fly home with another blow to her ego and her career. Oh, god she has to fly, she is terrified to fly. She drinks to calm her nerves before the flight and is feeling it. A turn of luck ups her flight status and puts her in business class where they serve more drinks. This flight changes her life- snow ball down the hill. She spills her life's secrets to a stranger, every little intimate detail. Yes, everyone ! but it's okay right ? She'll never see him again. LOL sure, right, yep.

B005COO1X6|1.0|I like many others maintain Steven King is one of the great authors of our time.  Have read everything he has written including the Dark Tower series.  He is a genius and thoroughly enjoy his work.<br />This \\"single\\" that they call a book is merely a short story and not a very good one at that.  I wanted more, much more and was left with a feeling of being cheated by amazon.com and Steven King.  The story was rushed without any substance to the characters.  But even if he had developed the characters it would have still been less then complete.  If I want a short story I will read Readers Digest.  This was a rip-off plain and simple.  I was excited and expecting a great read and turned the page and it was over...poof.  The muddy station wagon in the sky.
B0059XTUMC|4.0|What a curious film!  It's black and white with no dialogue or other sounds (except one or two words) with an accompanying musical score.  Doesn't really compare with the typical blockbuster with special effects, huge budgets, etc.<br /><br />The essence of the film is the life of George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) who is at the top of his acting craft in 1927.  This was as ominous year. It's when talkies were first introduced with Al Jolson as the jazz singer.  But Gorge can see no value in the talkies. He perseveres with his silent films and progressively goes backwards. The Great Depression arrives and he hits rock bottom.  His life can be contrasted with that of Peppy Miller, his love interest come nemesis, who positively sparkles with the new talking medium. She goes from strength to strength.  However, without spoiling the end for those who have not seen the film, their lives coincide again after having drifted apart.  There is a happy ending.<br /><br />Does the film work?  Well, it's very clever and, against the imprecations of the late W.C. Fields, there is also a starring role for George's dog.  But, to me, there was something missing.  You can only go so far with a single trick.  For all its charming players and the wonderful feel good aspect of the drama, I felt that it had been somewhat over-hyped.  Will it clean up at the Oscars?  Perhaps.  However, for the past year, my favourite film has been \\"Midnight in Paris\\".  I'm sorry but \\"The Artist\\" fails in comparison.

He wrote in the original Preface, \\"This book is an analysis of economic fallacies that are at last so prevalent that they have almost become a new orthodoxy... its effort is to show that many of the ideas which now pass for brilliant innovations and advances are in fact mere revivals of ancient errors...\\"<br /><br />The \\"single lesson\\" is stated quite plainly in the first chapter: \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\" (Pg. 17) He refers to failing to look at the long-run effects of a policy intended to help only a special group the \\"fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.\\" (Pg. 15-16)<br /><br />Hazlitt is no anarcho-libertarian, and admits that a \\"certain amount of public spending is necessary to perform essential government functions.\\" (Pg. 32) But he is most opposed to public works intended as a means of \\"providing employment.\\" (Pg. 32) If a bridge costs $10 million, he argues that taxpayers have that much taken away from what they would otherwise have spent it on, and \\"for every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else.\\" (Pg. 33)<br /><br />He states that when the government makes loans or subsidies to business, \\"what it does is to tax successful private business in order to support unsuccessful private business.\\" (Pg. 47-48) He argues that it is \\"foolish\\" to try to preserve obsolescent industries or methods of production.

B006UG90RM|5.0|As a childhood fan of Roth era Van Halen, when they parted ways I stayed with DLR buying most of his albums.  Back in '07 when they reunited and toured, I made sure I was there.  Afterwards, when rumors arose that they would release an album it was hard to believe.  5 years later here we are.  The album is great.  Better than my expectations.  The fact that SOME songs are re-worked songs they previously did not release, I would be disappointed if this was not the case.  But people knock it...even \\"professional\\" reviewers.  Van Halen more or less abruptly broke up after 1984.  I see this as picking up where they left off.  Who's to say these songs would not have been on a subsequent album back in the 80s?  I am not familiar with b-sides and demos from the band so these are all new songs to me.  I have read that the lyrics are new for the reworked songs...to me that makes them new songs.  I cannot stop listening to these songs:  She's the Woman  You and Your Blues  China Town  Blood and Fire  As Is  Trouble with Never  Stay Frosty  Big river  I did not list Tattoo since I wore out my iPod listening to it over the past month.  I'm trying to think of the last time I loved 9 songs on one album (and liked the rest of them)...I will update this post if I can think of one.
B0014H32MG|2.0|This is one of the few books I started but didn't finish. It was incredibly depressing and after a while I simply lost interest. I was hoping for a book that would describe more about the strict society in which this story takes place, but I felt that details were lacking.

B001USHRCK|5.0|I have had this set for 1 week and just finished building it.  The buildings are very detailed and complex.  The village comes with all kinds of accessories besides the buildings: a tree, stand, table, wagon, horse, two Lego cattle (I have never seen these before), baskets of fish, apples, and flowers. It took me 5 days to build it working on it a little each day.  This set is different from many castle sets in that there is not a whole lot of fighting going on.  There are a few guards/soldiers and a couple of weapons.  The complexity, detail and overall appearance makes it a winner. On this note, I must confess that as a thiry year old, I find this set excellent.  If I was a 12 year old, I would not be so impressed with it. Honestly, it seems like this set (as well as some others Lego has recently put out) are more geared toward adult collectors and less so toward children.  So if you are an adult, buy it for yourself if you find it appealing.  You will not be dissapointed (and I assure you that you are not the only adult buying Lego sets).  Also note that Amazon is not likely the cheapest place to buy it.  When Amazon sells Legos themselves, the prices are often good.  For some reason, the third party sellers of Legos on Amazon almost always have a higher price than buying from Wal-Mart or directly from Lego online.

I wondered if the dev was offering some sort of goodie for a favorable review, so I downloaded it. Then I disabled data, which is my standard procedure for a new game, and tried to launch it. I hate Feint, and there's no reason for this to have Internet access. Guess what? It won't launch without it. No matter how good a game is, if data access isn't inherent to gameplay, I'm not granting it.  Uninstall.

044024367X|3.0|I've been reading the Jack Reacher novels as I find them at the library, in no particular order.  Since the series is not in chronological order, that's not a problem -- a smart approach by Child.  But for some one who has read about half of the series, I think the harsh reviews for this one are not deserved.  It's not the best, but it's far from the worst, \\"61 Hours.\\"  All of his books are political, which adds to their interest.  Many institutions (congress, the army, the DEA) and many entanglements (the Iraq invasions, the war against drugs, the cold war) are subject to Reacher's jaundiced views.  The political overlay is an important part of the character of the world weary loner.  Which political issue is in the forefront is a function of where in the time span of the series of novels the particular story is laid.  Still, I find the Reacher stories that deal with his final period in the military, or directly re-involve friends from the military (such as \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\"), to be more enjoyable than the Reacher walks into the small town genre of which \\"Nothing to Lose\\" is representative.  Therefore, three stars.  Worth reading, and Child has written better books.
0439023521|3.0|The book is fair, not everything folks have made it out to be. The story itself is incredibly intriguing, but the dialogue is rough, and the characters feel flat. This might be one of those properties that looks better on screen.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Bella and Edward announce their wedding and plans are moving fast. Jacob is furious as he feels that Edward will either turn her into a vampire or kill her while on the honeymoon. Edward is concerned with how to control Bella if he turns her but she feels that it is not a problem. She just has to control herself while in the blood lust. She wants to wait to a later time before she is turned because she wants to enjoy her last \\"human\\" days.<br /><br />The movie follows the book very closely and therefore the storyline is intact. It did seem to drag a little at times and perhaps that is just the desire to make this into a two part movie series. The result is that Part 1 sets the tone for the story but most of the real action will be in Part 2. This is just like the book in that regard as the last half of the book contained a lot of action.<br /><br />For many people this first part will seem very slow but my wife and I liked it. I am more of an action movie guy but I am glad they stuck to the storyline.<br /><br />My wife and I listened to the books on CD and liked them but we have found the movies to be a little better and more enjoyable than the books. Perhaps it is visualizing the characters in your mind and seeing them finally on the big screen.<br /><br />We can't wait to see Part 2 of this saga!

B004LWZW7E|4.0|This review contains spoilers!<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Mankind has been genetically altered.  At the age of 25 they stop aging but a timing system only gives them 1 more year to live.  To get more time they have to work hard and they get compensated with time as currency. Everyone looks 25 but in reality they can be well over 100 years old with thousands of years more time on their biological clocks.<br /><br />Everything you want is paid with minutes, hours, days or years of lifespan.  Unfortunately the same establishment that gives you time payment for your work also keeps raising the cost of living (cost of living has a new meaning now doesn't it).  Prices seem to go up every day.  It is a method of population control.<br /><br />Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mom live day to day just barely having enough time left to survive each day.  A stranger who Will saves gives Will over 100 years of time leaving only 5 minutes to himself because he wants to die.  When Will realizes what has happened he plans to meet his mom to share the time and rejoice.<br /><br />The story leads to Will seeking vengeance for such a ruthless system when he realizes that the rich can be immortal while the poor live day to day in fear.  He meets Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) whose father is a timer broker and together they figure out how to get justice and share the life time currency with those who really need it.<br /><br />This movie has a great premise and has several analogies with the rich and poor in the world today.  Can you imagine knowing the time of your death and being helpless to prevent it?  Unfortunately the movie that could have been great falls short on several issues.  Two people with no criminal history are making daring robberies and stealing the most precious commodity in the world while millions just passively face death every day.<br /><br />With a better script and perhaps an underground movement to support them, this movie could have been a lot better.

B0062QFZ10|2.0|Alban Berg<br />Violin Concerto - 'To the Memory of an Angel'<br />Beethoven<br />Violin Concerto in D Major Op. 61<br />Isabelle Faust<br />Claudio Abbado<br />Orchestra Mozart<br />Recorded: 2010<br />harmonia mundi s. a.<br /><br />Compared with Berg's Violin Concerto played by Arabella Steinbacher [[ASIN:B002QEXNBQ Berg, Beethoven: Violinkonzerte]] , Isabelle Faust plays it too loudly and it lacks a musical conversation between the orchestra and the soloist. Abbado should have stopped her aggressive performance. Only the Choral of Bach's Cantata No. 60 \\"O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort\\" sounds beautifully.<br /><br />Berg quoted the Chorale \\"Es ist genug\\" from BWV 60, in the 2nd movement of his Violin Concerto. Text and Translation of Chorale: 'It is enough: Lord, if it pleases You, then release me! My Jesus comes; good night now, o world! I journey to heaven's house, I go there securely in peace, my great suffering remains behind. It is enough.'

B00280LYHS|5.0|When I started this series I was just going to yaa know go through the motions not expecting it to be any good. It was simply very popular and I thought well lets give it a try. So I immediatly latched onto this spectacular series and finished the entire series in a week. I just could completely relate to Percy Jackson with my love of water, thirst to prove myself, and longing to do something right in this world no matter what odds I face. I also related very well with Miss Annabeth Chase. I am quite intelligent not to toot my own horn. And I try to look for the most strategic, sensible, and beneficial solutions. So I was glad to find a family friendly book series that I could relate to so well. Every part surprised me throughout the series. But I am truely pleased with the outcome of the series. I always loved Luke and was very pleased to find that he died an Olympian hero who finally understood his fathers love for him in the end. But as far as Perseus and Annabeth I think their relationship has definatly matured over the course of the book and I am glad that they became Bf and Gf so to speak. I am very impressed how Rick Riordan pieced together the books so well. I am also glad that a new continuing series will be arriving. A five star thumbs up for Rick Riordan!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|There are few English language World War II movies that I haven't seen, so I didn't hesitate to see \\"Red Tails\\" on opening day, especially after I had seen a couple of trailers. Red Tails is an action-filled drama about the Tuskegee Airmen who flew from bases in Italy during 1944-1945. The movie covered the Red Tails from their ground attack missions in obsolete P-40 aircraft through their success in escorting B-17 bombers on missions deep into Germany, flying their hot new P-51 Mustangs. The flying scenes were as realistic as CGI can get.<br /><br />The acting was very good, especially considering the action-driven nature of the movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard were excellent as the leaders of the 332nd Fighter Group. Nate Parker and David Oyelowo played tent-mates; Parker played \\"Easy,\\" and Oyelowo was \\"Lightning.\\" They were friends and wingmates, but they seemed to be in a race to destruction, with Easy hitting the booze too hard, and Lightning too reckless for his own good.<br /><br />My only negative comments - and they're minor - are that the language wasn't very realistic, but that was obviously to get a PG-13 rating. Also, some of the phrases, such as \\"man up\\" and \\"we're good\\" weren't around until a few decades later.<br /><br />And in a scene where Lightning singlehandedly attacks a German \\"destroyer\\" near the Italian coast, the ship is obviously bigger than a destroyer, it looked more like a light cruiser.<br /><br />But those are minor quibbles. Red Tails was a marvelous action film and a stirring tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen of World War II fame.

B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the better books I'veread in a while. I wouldn't consider myself a sci-fi fan. I generally lean more towards fantasy, or fic-lit.

0375869026|5.0|Middle school sucked for me. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm really not. During the entirety of middle school, I never had any real friends. I may have looked normal, but I was still definitely an outcast. I cannot imagine going through what Auggie went through. His strength of character to be able to face that situation is incredible.<br /><br />Part of why he could survive the experience was just Auggie. He's a smart kid and really loved the learning part of school. When people stop to notice, he's funny. Having gotten to fifth grade and maintained a fairly positive attitude despite the staring and the people screaming at his visage is just courageous. In addition to his own strengths, he was lucky enough to have supportive people in his life. His parents and sister would do absolutely anything for him; their family is so loving and happy. Plus, he made a couple of friends to stand by him on the first day of school, Jack and Summer.<br /><br />This book nearly made me cry. Multiple times. For those who don't know, this is pretty rare. Unlike one of my friends who I will refrain from naming, tv shows and books are not constantly making me cry. The tears that threatened were caused both by sadness and happiness, which is pretty awesome.<br /><br />Kids are cruel. Never once have I doubted this, having been the victim of some verbal bullying myself as a child. Being surprised or scared at an unfamiliar face is unfortunate, but really cannot be helped; that response is instinctual. What is absolutely awful is the way that people continue to judge him, refusing to get to know Auggie's amazing qualities. Just because he's ugly, they do things like pretend that if they touch him they'll get The Plague. Like ugliness is catching. It's not like Auggie has a transmitable disease.<br /><br />Even worse than kids, who know what they're doing but at least have ignorance as some amount of an excuse, are the parents. One parent in particular tries to get Auggie kicked out of the school, because she feels like he's brought the level of the school down, even though he's a trillion times smarter than her son. This same mother photoshopped Auggie out of the class photo.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll stop with that now, because, really, you should read the book for yourself. I also want to mention that the method Palacio used to tell the story was highly effective. The narrative begins and ends with Auggie's perspective. In the middle, you hear from classmates, his sister, and some of his sister's friends. By bookending the story with Auggie, you're really able to see how much he has grown, and the other people's perspectives reveal how much he touched their lives too.he's brought the level of the school down, even though he's a trillion times smarter than her son.

B00422LESO|3.0|This was cute.  If you don't like cute Chick Lit then skip this one.  The premise was intriquing.  What fun it would be to be one of Jane Austen's heroines for a few weeks and then pop back into our old lives.  But as Jane, our heroine, finds out it can be difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality.  The writing was good, the characters believable if not always likeable.  It was a fast read, light and good for an afternoon when the rain is beating down and you nowhere to go.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|I have been a Macca fan for as long as I have been alive on this Earth. Have seen Paul several times in concert and have all of his albums, WINGS albums and of course, that \\"other little band\\" he started out with when he was younger.<br />When I heard he was goin the route of Rod Stewart, with doin some old standards, I was thrilled. I raced to the store to buy this and I am glad I had a gift card because this album is maybe worth the five bucks I paid for it.<br />The only good songs are the ones he allows his true voice to resonate in, the other ones are vain attempts to \\"sound\\" moody and sultry and raspy. THIS DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. I love McCartney's music so much and this LP is such a disappointment that it almost makes me angry at him all over again. We all had to sit through \\"Driving Rain\\" and \\"Choas and Creation\\" until (thank GOD) he gave us. \\"Memory Almost Full\\".<br />Paul needs to stop \\"tryin\\" to sound like anyone but....PAUL and start taking these albums more seriously...<br />Cus he aint gettin any younger and they may be his last...

B0078JOAOI|1.0|Agree with the first poster - the last 10mins or so proved the most interesting, reminding viewers who the bad guys really are. Other than that, it's a continuation of what made Season 2A so poor - lots of talking with absolutely little being resolved by the end of the 43 minutes. Had they kept Darabont on board, kept the bigger budget and stayed true to the feel created in the early part of Season 1, Season 2 would/should have been stellar. But alas, AMC is going the cheap route (fewer zombies and less action, limited location shooting). As it is, we spent all of Season 2A running around in a circle with a less-than stellar ending. \\"Nebraska\\" does little to ensure that Season 2B is going to be anything special, seemingly drawing an even smaller circle within. Starting to lose interest in this show fast...almost forgot to watch this ep altogether until the wife mentioned it in passing. Good work AMC!

0205313426|5.0|The Elements of Style changed the way I approach writing. The book is thin, only about a hundred pages, and you can read it in two or three hours. If you're even remotely interested in making your writing clearer and more effective (and if you're reading this, I'll hazard you are) buy it and read it. Keep it on your shelf; take it down when you need assistance or a refresher.<br /><br />At first, I didn't quite get this book. I kept waiting for Strunk and White to tell me something I didn't know - which happened sooner than I expected, and I realized the grammarians were imparting \\"rules\\" or conventions I knew intuitively, but couldn't explain when or why they ought to be applied (and I've read other grammar books and style guides). The Elements of Style is presented as a series of dictums, not usually my style of learning, but the dictums accumulate and morph into a kind of philosophy. And once you get through a dozen or so rules, you should almost be able to guess what's coming next.<br /><br />Not everything Strunk and White said is still applicable. For example, they argue you shouldn't say `forceful,' but rather `forcible,' but the language has mutated or evolved to where `forceful' is perfectly acceptable and `forcible' is rarely used. However, this book ought to make you see areas where you need improvement. It helped make my writing less wordy and, or so I'd like to think, more impactful. \\"Write in the active, not in the passive,\\" is darned good advice. \\"Put the important words at a sentence's end.\\" Ditto. In all the grammar books I'd read, I'd never read that before. Why use `owing to the fact that' when you can use `since' or `because'? Why say `in the event that' when the word `if' will do?<br /><br />There are other books which claim to expand on Strunk and Whites ideas, but I don't see what you'd need them. You don't need examples for every possible problem. You should be able to use The Elements of Style to logically conclude what you should do in cases not explicitly mentioned. That's part of the beauty of the book: it's larger than the sum of its parts. Well, that and it's just so very right.<br /><br />Troy Parfitt is the author of Why China Will Never Rule the Worldat's part of the beauty of the book: it's larger than the sum of its parts.

B0061QD82E|5.0|Let me start off by saying I used to own this movie on VHS. Now as most of you know I am sure, the version on VHS was more on the dull side as far as colors go. And the clarity of the details was not quite that sharp in appearance.  They then came out with the DVD, which was far better. The colors were definitely brighter.  Now with Blu-ray, on the other hand, not only are the colors bright but the details are so crisp and clear! I notice textures I could not originally see on the older versions of this film. It is absolutely amazing! The second I hit \\"play\\" on the menu and the opening credits began to roll I literally said \\"wow\\" because the textures that I never noticed before were suddenly noticed by me for the first time.  I love it. The blu-ray is definitely worth getting!

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I had heard many amazing things about Neil Gaiman's American Gods. I had to see for myself. Every good thing you've heard about this book is true. The style of writing is different from what is considered the \\"normal\\" writing style. The writing is more fluid, as though you are actually thinking. You become the writer, so to speak. Once you start reading, it is incredibly difficult to put down, as you are constantly wondering what is going to happen next. There are so many good things I could say about this book. It deserves at least 10 stars.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the book is...So many sleepless nights trying to read this book because I simply could not pry it from my fingers. This has quickly, and easily, slipped into the My Favorite Book category. Well worth the time and the money.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I must say that the christine is amazing, voice and wonderful acting. The phantom is amazing also. As a fan of musical theatre and not of the actors I have to say I enjoyed it quite much the new musical arrangement, the revised lyrics and the redesign costumes and scenography, though not completely remade, gives a bust that the phantom did need. I know there are people out there that think that the phantom should remain classic but any good classic knows when to evolve. The electric guitar in christines great finale of the theme song is simply amazing. I ain't a fan o mister webber the phantom being the only musical of his I like and do love this version even more! Maybe a revise of other of his musicals could render better work.  Another thing the led screens that work as multi scenography, me being an engineer I found quite quite amazing, the stage planning was also something to be proud, lightning and special effects where amazing,  About the bluray. I have no claims about, the filming is so amazing that it seems that you are watching a 'filming only'p performance, even better for the close ups look like promotional videos. The hd quality is of the best I have ever seen. The scenery wide shots are specially delicious. And ,masquerade was beautifully adapted to the new stage. The mirror scene was beautiful. Made with the led screens (alt ought) takes away a little of the original magic I found it perfect.

B0053JJLLC|3.0|Listen, I won't defend this book on the basis that it is another Crichton masterpiece.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />It's not even Crichton.<br /><br />But having read some of the negative reviews, you would think it's the worst piece of garbage ever written, and it's not that either.<br /><br />What it is is an interesting premise, executed by the numbers.  What you wind up with is a perfectly acceptable beach read, light and breezy and fairly quick-moving.<br /><br />And, if you loved the old Irwin Allen series, Land of the Giants,  you'll enjoy the twist on the concept employed here.<br /><br />In sum, I read it quickly and then re-read Timeline, in fact now I'm on a Crichton kick.<br /><br />How bad could that be?

0307959856|2.0|Like many others who have come to love Darcy and Elizabeth,  I am always eager for stories that continue their lives beyond the end of Jane Austen's marvelous romance.  This effort by P. D. James manages to be even more disappointing that others.  James states in her author'a note at the beginning of the book that Miss Austen did not choose to dwell on such odious subjects as murder and had she wished to do so, she would have written the story herself - and done it better.  Indeed, Ms. James fails to capture either the tone of Miss Austen's marvelous prose or her deft characterizations of those involved in the story.  Elizabeth and Darcy come off as confused supporting players rather than the protagonists they are meant to be.  Other characters are given short shrift, especially Jane and Bingley, who seem to appear solely as a sop to the reader's sensibility.  James' one line throw away entries to attempt to link the Elliots of Persuasion and the Knightleys of Emma fall flat and seem to exist solely to alert the reader that James has read Austen and believes herself equipped to blend all the stories into a unified whole.  Most lacking, however, is the detail and leisurely pace that makes the Austen novels such a rich and rewarding experience.  The murder is most awkwardly solved in the final pages of the novel and in a most unsatisfactory fashion.  I admit that creating a continuation of Pride and Prejudice that would do credit to the original is a very daunting task and on that should only be undertaken by the most proficient of writers with a superb understanding of Jane Austen, her characters and the world in which they lived.  This attempt is paltry and bound to disappoint.

0385342063|5.0|I know Kinsella is best known for her Shopaholic series but I never really clicked with them; however I love her standalones like Can You Keep a Secret? and Remember Me? so I had high expectations for this. They were met as I was immediately sucked in to Poppy Wyatt's world.<br /><br />The book starts in the middle of a crisis as Poppy has lost her engagement ring shortly before she is about to meet up with her judgy in-laws and mere days before the wedding. Then her cell is snatched, leaving her no way to be contacted by the hotel where the ring was lost. Coincidentally she finds a phone discarded in the trash and starts using that, putting her in touch with Sam, the boss of the lady who threw away the phone.<br /><br />It's kind of a crazy premise-would she really be allowed to keep that company phone that has confidential information on it? But Poppy is so likable that I just went with it. Over the course of a few days, she becomes very involved in Sam's life, even interfering at times, sometimes beneficially, sometimes harmfully but always charmingly to this reader. Of course, it soon becomes obvious that Poppy's fiance is not as good a match as Sam even as they both try to fight their feelings.<br /><br />There is actually a lot packed in to this story: family and friendship issues, Poppy's insecurities and inability to stand up for herself, corporate espionage, love and marriage. And it was all delivered in what I consider the signature Kinsella style and tone-light and breezy but not afraid of getting a little dark (seriously just a pinch of darkness to balance out the lightness).<br /><br />I did think the book as a whole was a smidgen too long and I'm not a fan of the cursing although I completely respect the author's right to use whatever language she wants.<br /><br />Overall: A fast, funny read that is sure to charm fans of Kinsella.
B0078JPVGY|1.0|Leave the farm!! We are begging you.  Leave the farm.  Its not so bad that these low brow washups are driving old vehicles but in a real shtf scenario many more would be sporting AR 15's, multiple glocks, maybe even some grenades.  Check with the Preppers they have that stuff now, if you hadn't noticed.  And also get OFF the farm.  Just go.  Get off the FARM already.  Kudos to \\"attack between living groups\\" storyline, but it doesn't make up for how severly you are cheating us.  So the fonze leaves his heater on the bar?  Why?  Is that some great distraction trick??  Really?  Not suspending my disbelief.  Lame but b for the effort. (Ughh Hershel and Rick just droning on and on like some shakespearian soliloquy) Kudos to Glenn for having the self control to forego just shooting himself right then and there.  To sum up.  Number 1:  GET OFF THE FARM!!!  Number 2: See number 1.  Number 3: consider exploring the I'm on a shopping spree theme.  One or more of the group goes crazy hording some great stuff(explore issues of conspicuous consumption or some other communist crap like that) ie upgrade vehicles, clothes, guns, food, get it?  Number 4:  Explore crime punishment for small groups, someone destroys a picture or momento intentionally.  How will they be punished?  Maybe they experiment with some differnt forms of organization such as committee, president, jury?  What is this Petti Coat junction?  Less Green Acres and more Book of Eli, Road Warrior 1, War of the Worlds.  Did you know that talk talk talk can distract from the enjoyment of the episode?  More editing cuts half the dialouge.  Pregnant pause look it up.  New characters, the professor maybe some more typical females.
0307352145|5.0|This book finally provided the validation I've needed for my feelings of frustration and anxiety I have about the way we live.  I have never felt like I fit in, and this book finally explained why.  I was always the kid who hated group work, loud parties, and crowded concerts, and thus was labeled \\"weird\\" and \\"anti-social.\\"  I always thought there was something wrong with me...until I read this book.  The author explains how American society has shifted from valuing the kind of person you are to the kind of person you portray...and along the way the \\"extrovert ideal\\" developed in which the talkative, gregarious, outgoing types became valued over the quiet, introspective, thoughtful types.  The history of all of this blew my mind, from the schools in the 50s sending letters home to parents stating that their child was a \\"problem case\\" if they didn't constantly speak up and socialize in class, to the shift of being quiet, reserved, and shy from personality traits to actual pathologies like social anxiety disorder.  It also talked about how other countries/cultures have the complete opposite perspective in that they value introversion over extroversion.  This book helped me realize that I am perfectly justified if I prefer to stay in and read a book as opposed to go out to a party, and that being introverted is normal and not something that needs to be \\"fixed.\\"  Every page I read hit home, as if this book was written about me personally.  If you have ever felt alienated for being an introvert, READ THIS BOOK.

1558908846|5.0|Wow...has it been 16 years already since this movie was first released? I remember taking my girlfriend to see this movie back in the summer of 1995 and we both enjoyed it. By then I was already a big fan of the Judge Dredd comic books and knew the character well. I still own my entire collection of all the Eagle Comics Judge Dredd series. Artist Brian Bolland's beautifully illustrated covers were the main draw for me, and the great stories inside hooked me further and kept me along for the ride throughout the series run. When I first heard that Hollywood was making a big-budget live action feature based on the adventures of the famous Judge from Mega City One, I couldn't believe it and anticipatedly awaited it's release. To be honest, I do not think that Sylvester Stallone was the most ideal choice to play Judge Dredd...He's okay in the role I guess. But, I actually thought that Dolph Lundgren would have been a better pick to play Dredd. Lundgren just had the more perfect features and physical attributes such as height to play Dredd. But Stallone had more box-office clout and whether we like it or not, this movie probably would not have gotten the kind of huge financial backing that it did had Stallone not signed on to star in it.<br /><br />The movie takes place in a dystopic future where mankind lives under giant glass-dome-shielded cities fortified by huge surrounding concrete walls that protect it's inhabitants from the lawless mutants and savages who dwell outside the city limits in what is known as the Cursed Earth; it's ravaged wastelands destroyed by past world wars and other conflicts. The cities are overpopulated and under-resourced to the point of chaos and anarchy, and the peace is dutifully maintained by the Judges, street law enforcers who are given total power to be Judge, Jury, and Executioners if needed in their patrols on the streets of Mega City 1.<br /><br />Stallone stars as Judge Dredd, the most feared and respected of all the Judges; a man who holds up the ideals of law and justice to a T and never waivers from the rules of the book. \\"I am the Law!\\", is one of his most famous lines, shouted here triumphantly in the movie by Stallone. A noble ideal that would later be questioned by Dredd himself in following issues of the comic books--but I digress. During a call to help pacify a violent outbreak between hundreds of agitated citizens in an area of Mega City, Judge Dredd winds up killing a bunch of perps and quickly stops the uprising using extreme lethal force which, much like Dirty Harry he is known for. His methods are brutal, but they get results. Meanwhile, a news reporter, who has been running a series of stories based on Dredd's aggressive tactics sometimes used to uphold the law within the city, is suddenly assassinated in his apartment by a person caught on video surveillance dressed up as a street Judge. Evidence at the crime scene strongly points to it being Judge Dredd himself who is the perpetrator of the crime, and so it goes that Dredd is found guilty of the dirty deed and sent to a penal colony to serve out a lifetime sentence among hundreds of other perpetrators that he himself has helped send there in past months. On the way to serve out his sentence, the transport ship taking Dredd and other convicts to the Penal Colony is shot down by the evil Angel Clan, a sadistic rag tag group of cannibalistic family members who have survived for years in the harsh wastelands of the Cursed Earth.<br /><br />Will Judge Dredd be able to survive in the unforgiving Cursed Earth, defeat the Angel Clan and be able to return to Mega City One to bring justice to those who have framed him for murder, and are now causing havoc, mass destruction, and trying to usurp power and control of Mega City 1? You will just have to watch the movie to find that out.<br /><br />Judge Dredd is one of those rare examples of a huge summer blockbuster movie that ended up bombing big-time at the box office, and one which critics mostly hated. But it is still a worthwhile and enjoyable movie to watch even after all of these years, maybe even moreso now than when it was first released. The action is exciting and plentiful, the sets, costume and prop designs, and production values are all top-notch and very impressive. The CGI effects themselves are for the most part pretty laughable, but they still have some redeeming qualities here and there such as the scenes showing the vastness and detail of Mega City one itself. The story is pretty good and involving as well, with enough interesting plot twists and turns to keep your attention. The acting isn't the greatest however...Stallone as Dredd plays it pretty much one-dimensional here, but is still fun to watch as he does what he does best, which is to take the bad guys out with the trash. And Armand Assante hams it up quite a bit as Rico, but for the most part portrays a pretty effective adversary for Dredd. And the rest of the cast for the most part plays it all pretty straight and narrow and nicely done...especially Max Von Sydow as the Chief Judge Fargo, and Diane Lane as Judge Hershey. A young Rob Schneider, fresh from his stint at SNL here, plays the comic interest, and reluctant sidekick to Dredd.<br /><br />Other highlights of the film include the very intimidating behemoth robot known as the ABC Warrior, an out-of-service robotic warrior used in past conflicts that Rico reactivates and now uses as his personal bodyguard, and the character known as Mean Machine Angel, a sadistic part human/part cybernetic cannibal Cursed Earth dweller who along with the rest of the Angel clan wants to kill, cook and eat Judge Dredd.<br /><br />If you are looking for some big-budget Sci-Fi action and adventure to keep you entertained for an hour and a half, give Mega City One's most notorious Judge Dredd a try.hile and enjoyable movie to watch even after all of these years, maybe even moreso now than when it was first released.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played it keeps me intertained and I love it woot woot lol
0439023513|4.0|This is a pretty good series and Mockingjay is a must read, although I felt it was not as tight as the first two. It had a rushed feel.
B003ASLJS6|4.0|Yeah, I know it's not Dirty Harry but at the time Eastwood made this film he was making the Dirty Harry pictures too.  And there is a similarity to this and the DH films.  His character has the same attitude and motivation for what he does and who he does it too.  I was never a big fan of westerns, but I have always like Clint Eastwood.  And it doesn't matter if its a western, sci-fi, action/adventure that he's in I have always enjoyed his movies.  This is no different.  Even though it's a western, and not a spaghetti western that he is known for but an honest to goodness western, it's a good movie.  I recommend this to anyone who likes either western or Clint Eastwood movies.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|This game was fun early on but got boring pretty quickly. The graphics and response are great but the method for rotation is touchy. -1 for open feint.
1451627289|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been this excited by a Stephen King book. 11/22/63 is a beautiful example of how genre fiction can tackle the big ideas and small personal stories we usually associate with literary fiction while weaving these elements into an epic and thrilling adventure.  Alternate history, what-if, time travel--call it what you will, this is a story about those things but also about much more. The fantastical element here is not horror for a change, though one can argue that the monster in this story is time itself. The water-shed event bearing down on our hero as he inevitably becomes more and more emotionally involved in his new life in the past gives the story an aching poignancy.  This is my favorite King book since The Stand, and it's a serious contender for knocking that fine book from the number 1 spot on my list.  Bravo, Mr. King, bravo.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I'm having fun at work with this app. I used to work at a grocery store and this app brought back memories! I love all the fun levels, and the graphics are adorable. Easy enough for my 6yr old yet challenging enough for me :) its a keeper!

B005ELZKWS|1.0|Yes Indeed! I agree Sammy... Something has gone terribly wrong here!!!  If you actually listen to this \\"overly-cheesy-sandwich\\" you'll understand why.  I suggest you do yourself a huge favor and pass on this pile of steaming dung unless a toilet is really handy.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Webber's classic musical is beautifully staged for the Royal Albert Hall and presented in sparkling high definition. Hats off to the mosaic of talents that gave this performance the allure and pomp expected of Phantom of the Opera. Top performances and wonderful costumes are met with terrific camera work and such an orchestra to entice even the most discriminating Phantom. It's a Phan's Valentine. Bravo!
1451627289|3.0|The triumphs in this book, as well as the disappointments, all come down to the details.  In parts, the writing is transcendent and thought-provoking.  In parts, the plot is compelling.  However, the details....whether too many or too few...drag the book down.  Other reviewers here have commented on the dragging middle section of the book, and they are completely right.  Tighter editing was needed here.  We are treated to two descriptions of a variety show....and it is the same variety show.  We learn about two school plays in excrutiating detail, involving minor characters.  We see girls jump roping over and over and over.  We slog through endless descriptions of Oswald and his long-suffering wife.  It is not that there are too many details.  It is that all the wrong details are emphasized.  Do we really neeed to know in gruesome detail about both Jake's and Sadie's medical recovery?  No.  Would we actually like to find out what exactly made them fall in love with each other? Yes.  And those details are sadly lacking.  Meanwhile, other details make no sense at all.  Here's are just a couple of examples....Jake keeps placing bets with shady bookies, and the whole time I'm thinking, why not just drive to Vegas and place a bet legitimately? Another detail that particularly bothered me was when Jake says \\"too bad Al didn't think to write down any stocks that would do well\\".  Unless you are living under a rock, you would know to buy IBM and GM and other blue chip stocks in that time period, and things like Apple, Intel, and Microsoft later.  I do not buy that Sadie would finally pry from Jake the fact that he is, indeed, from the future, and then hardly ask any questions about it.  I mean, really?  You wouldn't be a little bit more curious?  It is perhaps odd to complain about realism in a time-travel novel, yet the characters' behavior often does not seem realistic.  There are other more significant problems with this book as well.  To begin with, we are treated to a view of the world that is very skewed to the left.  Well, OK, I can live with that...it is Stephen King after all.  I know what I'm getting into when I pick up a book of his.  In this case, however, it detracts from the book's effect.  For example, having the Iranian hostage crisis become worse when President Reagan takes office....yeah, right.  Comments about Barack Obama also come to mind.  The next problem with this book is the ending.  (Spoiler ahead).  I cannot buy that Jake would undo the Kennedy rescue only to not go find Sadie.  I can't believe that he didn't go to Savannah to woo her and marry her and prevent her from marrying psycho broom man in the first place.  Then, the reader is led to believe that Sadie led such a selfless life helping others because Jake did not interefere and have a relationship with her.  Is this to suggest that she would not have led a life volunteering or helping others if she DID fall and love with him again and marry him?  Plenty of people are married and have families and still volunteer and help others.  I was very put off by this.  The whole ending was anti-climatic and unsatisfactory.  Lastly, the major problem I have with this book is the moral question.  King paints a picture of the world that is almost post-apoctalyptic due to the asassination being thwarted.  The way this is all laid out is very interesting.  However, the thoughts behind that are that 1) one man's action can affect the entire world leading you to believe that 2) there is nothing and no-one in control of the universe.  Maybe there is some random machine or puppet or something, but certainly nothing like, gee, let me think, GOD.  That is a nice thought if you are an atheist; however, if you are not an atheist, the premise is rather troubling (to say the least).  The one moralistic part I do like is King's implication that environment shapes character and behavior.  If you do not delve too deeply, it is an enjoyable book.  It is a shame, however, that it does not hold up to close scrutiny.
B005VGWT2K|3.0|I expected an excellent piece of work from Scorsese and found this rather average, at times disappointing.<br />What is especially annoying is that all the songs are cut off brutally... My 11 year old daughter was wondering why they did not choose a 'fading-out' technique to ending songs prematurely and actually why not just play the song to the end???<br />There sure has been a lot of cutting and jumping around from one interviewee to the next. It was great to hear Dhani read George's diary, but he could have been coached do to it more naturally. It felt a bit rushed. The ending with Olivia was weird, not the message, but her facial expression.  All in all, this piece of work looks like a very rushed effort. What a pity!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I loved David Tennant as Doctor Who and part of me misses him quite a bit; however, it took me about 10 minutes of the first episode of Season 5 to warm up to Matt Smith and now I like his portrayal of The Doctor just as much as Tennants....AND the writing in Season 5 was better and more consistant than in Seasons 1 through 4. There were no really weak episodes, while Seasons 1 through 4 had at least 2 or 3 weak stories each.  And Karen Gillan......oh, Karen!  I received Season 6 for Christmas, but I have not had a chance to watch them yet....but I look forward to more great episodes with Matt.
B0076OW9DE|5.0|I don't know if this album will find much favor with the young'uns because it's very much done in a jazzy vintage style, as different as night and day to today's anthem-like top of the voice numbers. I for one love this album, but that's because I am older and have either heard various version of these songs either through my parents or grandparents. Paul's sweet voice on the simpler melodies \\"it's only a paper moon and \\"the inch worm\\" is just gosh darn cute that it makes me smile. While \\"Home\\" sung with a touch of the minor key, has the forties era romance.  In \\"more I cannot wish you\\", you get the feeling that Paul is just singing to himself, like we would if we were remembering an old time and an old place, with no one else listening. The album is full of sultry and blues, sometimes tongue in cheek, I would guess. It's a tip of the hat to when songs told a stories. This valentines day, play \\"My Valentine and \\"always\\", it's best served with roses and moscati.
B000B5MI3Q|3.0|I've had this watch for a little over a year and it invariably lost about 5-10 minutes per week. A couple times it actually locked up and just stopped. Once it went completely haywire and would gain up to an hour a day. This is the first time I've gotten a self-winder - it was a gift. Not sure I will get another one, or if I do, it won't be a Seiko. The last issue I had with it is that the little tail end band keeper broke. I chucked it into a drawer and haven't taken it out since.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|I bought the Original UK Edition season 2, thinking I would get exactly what was shown On PBS.  I gave it 1 star because the scenes cut are important parts of the story and I felt I was being short changed. Of all the items I purchase from Amazon only one had to be replaced. A very good record. Unfortunately these disks can't be returned. I've been a member of PBS for a long time and my membership will continue. However, I am disappointed in  PBS for supplying a video which is an incomplete copy of the original drama.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|This is by far the best weather app available, but when I go to update it on my Acer iconia a500 tablet it won't let me keep my user settings. when I Try to install the app manually is says the package exists with a different signature, which means the company (or whoever is building and signing the app for release) is using a different keystore. Annoying because I don't want to have to re-input all my settings and Widgets like I had to do on my Motorola droid2.<br /><br />EDIT<br />In the latest updates it seems that the weather has gotten more and more inaccurate. I can look at a thermometer outside and it shows 64 degrees, but the app says it's 80 out. That's TOO far off even for general area. Weather.com website even has a more accurate temperature.
0811879542|5.0|This is one of the best books I have found for preschool children, it is so much fun.  I would recommend it to every grandparent.

B0019HQIFE|5.0|If you are a guitarist or musician, you will love this disc.  John Mayer opens with an acoustic set, then a set with the Trio, and finally the full band.  Every bit of feeling / emotion comes out in his playing.  You cant go wrong !  Sit back and enjoy, this guy is unbelievably talented !
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Never played a game like this, very fun game and pretty challenging, I thought it was like tetris but I couldn't be more wrong, it's about fitting groceries in a bag lol. Love this game
B0061S073A|4.0|Very easy to use and extremely helpful for keeping the kiddos out of the apps, and controls that they don't need to be messing with.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Got this game on sale here, best two dollars I spent here, live this game, it's tough but it's a lot of fun. It's accurate to say it's a reverse tower game, you are the aggressor in this game love the concept. Highly recommended
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that this game is very difficult. but a good app and if you don't have it you should get it
0785139168|4.0|I was so excited to receive this and am very happy with it. It follows the story quite well, but also seems to me that it got some ideas from the 2005 version maybe, but I'm not positive about that. The illustrations are lovely and it is in true comic form. The only problem I have, and it's just my personal opinion, is the characters don't look like I hoped they would. They are too modern looking and too perfect, with lipstick and eye makeup and sharp features. I guess I was looking for something more like some of the drawings in the back of the comic and on the cover even, the characters look nothing like the cute, soft caricature drawings that those are. Other than that it's lovely and I can't wait to buy Emma and Sense and Sensibility!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I hope everyone gets it. it is so additing. hope u guys love it has much as I do. I absolutaly love this amazing and wonderful app.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great app.  The multiple versions and multiple languages make this a great study tool.  Most of the versions can be downloaded onto the Kindle, but if you prefer you can keep all of them on the Cloud.  This is a great feature.  I was going to buy an E-Bible but this is a perfect substitute.  If you are looking for a good Bible for your Kindle, this one is definitely worth a look.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|as simple as the game is its very addictive, somewhat like tetris very fun cant wait to unlock more options and get all 3 stars for each level
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Thanks, Paul !    I sense the inspiration is (at least in part) Nilsson's \\"Nilsson Schmilsson\\" albums--not a bad model.  By the way, have another listen to \\"Wings-Wild Life\\" and sit back and smile.  Why do Americans not embrace popstars as they age (er, mature), as the French enjoy doing?  Relax...Music can only make life more charming.  And check out Charles Trenet...  Cheers!
377571622X|5.0|Gregory Crewdson is an amazing photographer and this book is full of his eye candy pictures. I bought this book for a quick refrence guide to his photography and found that it is a book worth hanging onto. If you enjoy photography you will love his work.

B000007T1M|5.0|First off, let me review the actual music, which is why this product gets a five star rating. The music of this album is nothing short of amazing. It never gets repetitive and each song is so unique. This is the album that Serj is at his quirkiest and silliest. This is not to say that he sounds very silly, though. His voice is very powerful and makes you listen. All in all, this is probably the best System of a Down album. Now, onto other factors...  It seems like these people REALLY want you to keep their stickers on the packaging. I tried to get them off and they ripped a bunch and left sticker residue and parts of the sticker on. I thought, \\"no problem, just use some handy-dandy goof-off to get the sticker residue off!\\" Big effing mistake. Instead of rubbing off the sticker residue like it always does, it ends up spreading the residue ALL OVER THE THE THING. I kept trying to get it off with a soapy and watery paper towel and it make it worse, ruining the entire thing. I just bought another one, but, I am still pissed about the sticker part. I usually try to get the stickers off of things to make them look nicer, but... I just don't know what happened. I don't know what forsaken substance they used as adhesive to keep those stickers on, but don't try to take them off.  (I doubt it will, but, PLEASE don't let the stickers keep you from getting this album. It is amazing.)
0374275637|5.0|excellent book, but a bit long. lots of useful insights for anyone interested in making better decisions. luckily, the meat of the book is in the first half of it. also, it shows (in detail!) how difficult it is to figure out how and why humans decide to do what we do. despite its heft, i recommend to read it to the end, if nothing else, at least the conclusion. in fact, the conclusion should be read after about making it about halfway through the book because it puts the author squarely into the picture of his own research and what he has learned from it.
B000V5UDBA|5.0|An enjoyable, light yet meaningful episode. I like episodes of any series that don't take themselves too seriously. This episode briefly broaches the venerable \\"Prime Directive\\" which O'Brien tactfully(?) disregards. Also we find out that Odo never carries a weapon, which as far as I'm aware, holds true throughout the series. Interesting character development with O'Brien, Odo, and Sisko.  ...looking forward to more episodes!
B0039TD7PY|3.0|Love the CD that I was able to listen to, but the 2nd CD of the set won't play in my stereo.  That has never happened with this player.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun. I can sit and play for hours and hours and never get bored cuz they are all different!
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Aggravating to use:  * Keep getting sync \\"conflicts\\" that make the note unusable even when only using on one device.  * Note jumps around while trying to scroll in edit, often making it nearly impossible to edit  Also:  * ridiculous TOS  * why does it need to \\"Read the low-level system log files\\"?
B0064NTZJO|5.0|To sum this up in a short, sweet review: Awesome. Yes, awesome! This movie stimulates not only your eyes, but also your ears, your skin - everything. The music almost puts you into this hypnotic state while the dark of the night rides leaves you lost in the scenery. Everything gets under your skin. This film is so beautiful, its beyond any other movie in years. I've seen other people say that this is the worst movie -- don't listen. They are obviously ignorant to what makes a good movie. These people probably prefer the Hollywood hyped, lack of a story line but packed with hundreds of explosions... you know, junk. This is art and it's brilliant!
B006PHD0RW|1.0|I have an LG Optimus T with T-Mobile service.  Connecting by wifi, it chugs and just says \\"Application not installed\\" with no further explanation.  I'd love to give it a try...
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I love Dylan's music.  Just last summer I saw him in concert and have listened to the recent boxed set of mono recordings maybe 75 times in the last year or so.  For the most part I don't don't pay a huge amount of attention to new music - a lot of the names on this album are new to me.  You might think I'd be one of the ones that hate this.  Think again.<br /><br />There are over seventy different artists doing their interpretation of over 70 songs.  Different artists.  Different interpretations.  All of them are valid.  Some of them blow me away.  For example - Hollis Brown is not my favorite Dylan and I usually don't listen to hard rock but Rise Against creates a new powerful work of art out of this song as classic as Hendrix version of All along the Watchtowers.<br /><br />You know, I've heard Hendrix and The Byrds and Manfred Man and dozens of others do covers of Dylan songs and they did a great job back in their day.  Well, this is today and I for one am not unhappy that we have new interpretations, new voices speaking the words of Dylan for today. So many voices in so many styles all unified to sing for Freedom, to sing for Amnesty International.  To sing Dylan.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|When I first heard Tattoo I thought..\\"Well Crap..this is gonna suck!\\" but after getting the album and listening to the whole thing through I am thrilled with what Eddy and the boys have done. Could not have been a better return of the band! The songs are all great in their own rite. They don't all sound the exact same and each have personality. Personal favorites are She's the Woman and Stay Frosty..  If you are a rock fan this is a must..if you are a Van Halen fan..then..well..you should already have this!!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|After six months of use the right earpiece broke. A week later, the left side broke as well. Other than the cheap quality, the sound is fine and mic works well. Pass on these.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|The production values are on par with games like Where's My Water, which is saying a lot.  The game is very well produced, with sharp, charming graphics and fun, engaging puzzle gameplay.  This is a good buy even if you miss it while it's the faotd.  EDIT: I'm knocking a star due to the fact that the game will no longer open on my phone (ZTE Warp).  The only way I've found to get it working again is to uninstall, restart my phone, and re-install.  This of course wipes all my progress in the game.  This is a real bummer because this is one of the more enjoyable games I've encountered so far on Android.  Hope it gets fixed in an update.
B001N18HP0|5.0|Great, classic album from the 90's.  Very cool set with the original album remastered (disc 1) and the album reproduced (disc 2), which sounds a little cleaner...less vocal and guitar effects.  A more raw version of the album.  Super cool.  Other reviews may have more info on this second disc.  I've been getting into vinyl for about the past 6-7 months and there's a very definite difference between pressings.  Some have average sound and you can tell the vinyl release was a second thought.  Pearl Jam's Ten is one of the best.  They put some effort into this to make sure it sounded great.  Very clear, crisp...great quality...awesome album, fantastic sound quality, and with two separate versions of the entire album?  Five stars, easy.  Buy it.  Like most albums, this one spins at 33 1/3 RPM's (if that's not listed).  Fantastic buy.  One of the better deals.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the year. Should get MANY GRAMMYS. Love his voice.Can listen to \\"over and over again\\":).A must buy no matter your age. It shows his heart.

1595827684|5.0|I'm a big fan of art books and this one did not disappoint. From cover to end, it was informative and beautiful.<br /><br />Every main character, such as all of the companions, has a page dedicated to their origin. In Tali's case, they started with a Geth and with every iteration moved her further away from that model. There is a brief paragraph on the page explaining why they chose to go certain routes with character models or what the initial idea for each race was. The page covering Ashley's progression is one of my favorites. I would say more about Ashley's page but since it covers her story in ME 3, I don't want to give much away. Let's just say they've added a more feminine look to her and with good reason.<br /><br />The pictures of the worlds were nice but even the Mako page was more in-depth. It was fun to see how the Mako went back and forth from modern tank to hovercraft (which they went with on ME2). The worlds and citadel parts were just a bit flat for my tastes. Still, it was nice to see the concept art.<br /><br />The book covers all three games in the series and has a nice intro page with the ME3 CE Male and Female Shepard covers. It even dives into the Shadow Broker DLC from ME2. Really wish it had all of the DLC but it does cover Zaeed and Kasumi so that evens it out.<br /><br />Overall I am quite happy with this purchase and it will be showcased in my bookcase for awhile. For those of you wondering, there is no DLC code with this book. The weapons DLC seem to be only for Barnes & Noble pre-orders, which is still active until Feb 20th if you are really that interested in the DLC.
1401923127|5.0|It's an awesome experience to go through this book. This is a hard-core science book without any hyperbolic mention of spirituality. It has been a life changing experience for me. I always had a feeling that to excel in any field you ougth to have a very firm belief on something. The sages have beliefs in God; you or I may have belief in something else; and it is this unflinching belief that provides us with the required amunition to combat any challenge in our lives. This belief provides us the extra courage which helps us pass the seemingly insurmountable mountain in our lives. This book only vindicated this thought of mine. It is not for easy readers. This is a tough book to digest - I read it twice to get the true essence. Just go for it.
B0069WUZVM|5.0|This is a great buy. The seller definitly came thru with my order. The price is great, the seller sent it promptly, & it was in great condition. I would recommend this to anybody.
B0078N2MTE|3.0|Take Shelter is one of those movies that keeps your interest and then lets you down in the end. An alternate ending is needed for this movie, one with more drama and follow through. The casts does as good as they can with the slow moving movie. I would say rent it if you can;t find anything to watch but do not buy.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so much fun. Thank you Hidden Variable Studios and Amazon. Everyone please show some love for superman, it must be hard to support all those kids on his bagger salary. At least now we can understand his bad reviews, he's tired. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE GREAT GAME.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie.  One of my all time favorite Disney movies ever and I'm so excited that it's finally out of the vault.  Any Disney lovers should see them on Blu-Ray, it's a whole new experience and it's so much better.  Most of my family do not have Blu-Ray players, so I like to buy them with both Blu-Ray and DVD discs so we can watch the movie wherever we are.  The Digital Copy is an added bonus that I had to have for this movie, now I can download it onto my iPod and take it wherever I want.  A little word of warning, the Digital Copies DO expire.  If you buy them, make sure you download it soon so it doesn't expire on you.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great app but you really need to provide an update with the nrsv. but great app otherwise. will be watching for the update!

B004KABHEY|5.0|Unlike a lot of readers here, I didn't see the big twist coming at all. I was completely dumbfounded and even had to put the book down for a few minutes to get my head around it. After I'd finished I went back through the whole book trying to figure out how in the world I'd been fooled so completely.<br /><br />Here's a question, though (BIG SPOILER): The one thing I didn't quite manage to understand was the scene with the person Teddy thought was the \\"real\\" Rachel Solondro, whom he had a conversation with in the cave over a campfire. She warned him about the goings on at Ashcliffe and how they would kill her if they captured her. After the big reveal, I assumed that he had hallucinated her, since she conveniently confirmed every paranoid delusion he was laboring under. However, then I recalled that later he came back to the same cave and saw that, though she was gone, the remains of the campfire were there, making it seem that an actual person had been there. Was she another \\"actor\\" Dr. Cawley recruited for his experiment? Or did Teddy hallucinate her, and then later hallucinated the remnants of the campfire?<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm impressed that so many people saw the ending coming. I was stunned!

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love the uniqueness and nonchalance of Lana del Rey's voice.  It is a welcome change to what current pop female artists are doing.  She almost reminds me of a woman Johnny Cash.

0743289692|5.0|I couldn't put this down. The language is remarkably straight-forward, almost journalistic in style, which somehow makes it all the more poignant. Ali's life story is astonishing and harrowing, and over and over again I found myself in awe of her resilience and courage. I've been appalled to see how many people dismiss this memoir as a mere political rant. I suppose that dismissing the voices of oppressed women is one of the most powerful tools of the oppressors. But Ali does not get the last word here. Even now, she lives in hiding under armed guard. Read this book if you want to understand why a woman would risk her life to tell her story.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|I have to state that this is the best material that LC has made. I can listen to the album from start to finish, (rarely skipping).  LC has been working on their sound and style for years, even though most people consider \\"Comalies,\\" as their master piece. \\"Swamped\\" and \\"Heaven is a lie\\" are singles that shined light onto the band's talent.  However, \\"Dark Adrenaline \\" delivers songs that are unforgettable. There are heart pounding guitar riffs with heartfelt lyrics.  Cristina 's voice is haunting as she shows off her signature chanting.  Andrea the male vocalist voice has improved overall, and is more controlled. Their voices together make magic. This is what makes LC distinctive from the rest. Here are the break down of the songs. The scale is from 1 to 5 (the higher the number the better the song is).  1. Trip the Darkness- An excellent choice for a single. Andrea singing is really good on this song. The hook is explosive. Cristina's vocals are haunting. This song showcases her range. 5/5  2. Against You- Love the lyrics in this as Cristina sings \\"I'm a revolution you cannot feel.\\" The hook is quite catchy. 5/5  3. Kill the Lights- A potential single. This song is full of hooks. I love this song. I hope this is their next single. It almost sounds like a love story going on b/t Andrea and Cristina. 5/5  4. Something More- Another song with a unforgettable hook sang by Cristina.I'm not a fan of the lyric \\"I don't want to pray.\\" 4/5  5. Upside down- Cristina's voice in this song sounds squeaky. I don't really understand the lyrics or what LC is trying to say. The song is  okay, but not their best. 3/5  6. End of Time- This a a beautiful song that is a bit softer. It sounds like a love story b/t Andrea and Cristina. The hook is not as catchy but does the job. 4/5  7. I don't believe in Tomorrow- I didn't like this song at first, but now it's my favorite. This is basically a kiss off song, and Cristina is telling  someone off. 5/5  8. Intoxicated- Cristina chanting iswhat makes this song great. I love how she sings the verses. 5/5  9. Loosing my Religion- This is a well done cover. Cristina's voice does this song justice. I like this version better  than REM. 5/5  10. Army Inside- Andrea does a great job with the chorus.  The lyrics are just okay.  Maybe it will grow on me. 4/5  11. My Spirit- This one is starting to grow on me. The chorus is smooth.  The only slow song on the album. 4/5  Must hear \\"Kill the Lights,\\" \\"I don't Believe in Tomorrow,\\" \\"Intoxicated\\", and \\"Loosing My Religion.\\"
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|I'd love to join the ranks of people who love this movie. Off the top, it had two really great things going for it: (1) Paris and (2) its thought-provoking concept.  Where it derails is that it is entirely too heavy-handed in getting its point across. We get it--he and his fiancee are incompatible; his foil is a complete talking head who everyone else loves; and other things I won't reveal just in case you're still wanting to see it. Trust me, we get it. It was too much in my opinion. Nuance has its virtues.
141694737X|5.0|Love this book for my year old. Its won't break and she can't get enough! Highly recommend for anyone with little ones.
0307949486|1.0|I must say, I watched the movie first. Much like the book started off really slow. Although, the book took a lot longer...most of which I only kept reading because I knew what the ending was like. If I hadn't of seen the movie I would have thrown the book in the fire a long time ago after reading the first quarter of it. I even read a bunch of reviews on here. The ones that stuck out to me, and held true to my outlook on the book are every negative review on amazon about this book. The title...ridiculous. Ya she had a dragon tattoo. So! Her character could have been played by some nerd and it would have been the same story. Either the translation isn't all correct or this was just poorly written. If I were you, watch the movie, which, towards the end, gets good. Sick and demented and sadistic, but good. Save yourself the complete waste of time reading this book. The title should have been called Vanger or The Vangers or Deep withing the Vangers...you get the point.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is like bubble gum for the brain.  You find yourself trying over and over to hit pigs by slingshotting different birds into new and ever more frustrating structures.  This will waste your time, but if that's what you're looking for, join the millions.
B004G6009U|5.0|I didn't realize how awesome that this movie was. It was incredible.  The bluray had beautiful colors and looked really crisp. The sound is fantastic.
B0000001PW|5.0|This album is such great music that words just don`t express. I`ve been a fan of CCEB for a long time and up to this day I had all the albums of this great band except for this one. Not that I wasn`t aware of it, but I remember hearing it 20 years ago and not enjoying it the way I enjoyed Beneath the Mask and Light Years in the early 90`s.  Since I´m into music and fusion and jazz again and after reading all the great reviews about this album on Amazon, I decided to give a second chance and it really is fantastic.  It is the most elektric of them all (the first five albums at least) and though I`m not a fan of eletronic music, I`ve got to say that the eletronics here pleased me very much. Weckl`s Simmons Kit is outstanding and combined with Chicks elektric piano sounds like moving to a new level, I must say.  The adittion of John, Scott Henderson and Rios gives some depth to the music. The album sounds good and there is no compression of the sound here.  All selections are great, there isn`t a single music that is not good!  Recommended.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is a perfect mix of romance, buried in action and conflict. After months of thinking about getting it and reading it before the movie comes out, I ordered it and finished it in two days. It's been a while since I've picked up a book and used ALL my free time just to find out what happens next. Katniss is a good heroine, although she is very self absorbed throughout the story, of course it is her story so I guess she can do that. The story didn't go the way I thought it would but then became clearer as the book progressed. Suzanne does a great job of making her environments and emotions pull the reader in. A great read. I am almost finished with the second book and it is just as good as the first. I recommend this to any reader, young or old.
0062082353|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Chris Kyle is an American hero and deserves to be respected by his countrymen.  I would ignore most of the bad reviews as it seems most have a political agenda or do not understand his dry sense of humor.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I bought this book based on a brief article a friend posted on facebook.  The parenting ideas the article mentioned were all topics my wife and I have discussed in regard to raising our first child, a little girl due to be born in June.  The writing style was entertaining and easy to relate to, so I bought the book.  2 days later, I've devoured the text, shared half the passages with my wife (who told me to stop spoiling the entertaining parts for her) and recommended it to several friends.  I certainly didn't agree with every idea the French hold dear, our child will be breast fed and we'll be trying to avoid their odd penchant for suppositories.  But then again, I don't think the author agreed with everything she wrote either.  My impression is that the author researched and compared some of the core principles of American and French parenting, then tried to use the ones that worked best for her.  Which is exactly what I intend to do with the ideas presented here.  This book is not a parenting manual or even a \\"How To\\" book for raising a quiet kid who'll know the difference between camembert and brie at the age of 3.  Instead, it's a set of well written stories about a woman raising her children in a culture that views being a parent differently than America.  It describes how the French believe that parents come first, that having a well behaved child isn't about how the child acts but how the parent acts, and that bringing up a child with good manners and a respect for others is a lot of work.  I'm ready to get to work and start creating Cadre for our little girl.  My only regret is that once I send my child to preschool, she won't be in an environment where 3 year children get tiny 4 course meals planned out by a team of gourmet chefs.  Or maybe its just that 3 year olds in France seem to eat better food than I do.

0439023521|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. So engaging and thrilling, I would give it 6 stars if I could!!! I had such a hard time putting it down!! The unexpected always happens, which makes it even more suspenseful!!! You have to read this book!!!!!!!!!:):)
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Just got my 8120, and it is amazing!  I have an Kuhler H20 920, and it idles around 30c and when playing the old republic at 1920x1080 with 120Hz, it shoots up to around 45c, which is still amazing.  I haven't over clocked it yet, but there is plenty of temp to spare!  With my SSD, windows boots in about 10 seconds from my pushing the power button, mainly because I have a 5 second bios delay.
0439023521|4.0|One of thee best young adult fiction books I have read in a while. The plot is not that original, all I could think was Battle Royal,but obviously with a bit more young adult teen feel to it. I read it in one day, couldn't put it down. Highly recommend

B000H309P6|5.0|August '72 Peter Hammill decides to pull the plug on Van Der Graff Generator at the height of it's power opting for a solo career. This album recorded in early '73 reflects the turmoil and struggle of the band and the man. There is an ever present sadness an isolation a paranoia written in the lines that does not relent...slowly leading you into the darkness. Somehow the overall REALIZATION of this work is as relevant as ever. As people were still going through the same development of psyche, IMO. Hammill pours his emotion into these songs, while maintaining a criptic strategy (glasnost) that uncoded reveals a startling truth: \\"Big Brother\\" wants you to program yourself! Remember that while spending time with electronics you've fitted yourself with. There are machines that can record your thoughts and dreams and do! The original album is long 50:40, most of the time I listen to tracks 1,3,5,8 and one of the other songs or bonus tracks. The other four members of VDGG appear sporaticly, most notably on 'Black Room/ The Tower'. This is a VDGG song Hammills' chameleon voice features shades of David Cousins even Klaus Meine. Hammill is a true mimic, the Mocking bird or Brown Thrasher of Rock-n-Roll. yet no one sounds like him. On other albums he sounds like Arthur Brown, Alice Cooper, Roy Harper, Geddy Lee, Lou Reed, Bowie, Robert Calvert, Edgar Broughton, Ric Ocasek, etc. etc. Then his music reminds you of many many more. Yet when you hear \\"Lemmingings/Cog\\" or \\"In The End\\" two completely different songs there's nothing to compare them to. In the 70's alone he released 7 band, 8 solo and 2 double live albums and more. Penned nearly all the songs, recorded, semi-engineered and produced most of his work. He recorded 3 albums from Feb.'73 - Mar.'74 mostly at his home studio. This approach certainly was'nt cutting edge and the results are recordings more akin to late 60's pioneering stereo engineering efforts. I can't think of any comparitive albums to these three, by anyone. The tower is a stunning expose' of audio-visualization like \\"Lighthouse\\" from 'Pawn Hearts'. It did'nt hit me upon first listen, but then...I suggest listening to this song in the dark for maximum effect. It is afterall part of (In The) Black Room. This is music that will appeal to only a small minority. The way I rate albums this is an 8.1 so 5 stars. It's no 'Pawn Hearts' it is the closest to a VDGG album of all his solo work.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A game for all ages. Its cute and I think everyone would like it. My least favorite part is when you finish and it has four more seconds till u finish the game.
055357342X|5.0|First, let me start by saying if your into fantasy but always fill like they are over done with magic and are just not deep into the characters then this is the book series for you. Its brutal in your face about war and politics like others have commented. The way it builds the characters and the relationship you develop with them is very impressive as well. You learn to care about their problems and sympathize with their passions for justice, honor, truth, the common good, and how each one does the best they can in a magical, chaotic world. This book series is full of lies, betrayals, twists, and hope that keeps you grasping onto every page as if your life depended on what comes next. Martin has a great way of making you fill like your right there beside the characters and all of them too even the ones you don't like. This relationship from every point in the seven kingdoms is what makes the song of fire and ice series one of my all time favorites.
B0071QIN00|5.0|\\"Trial Extreme 2 Winter\\" is just an awesome game.<br /><br />The graphics are great, the sounds are good, and the presentation is nice.<br /><br />But what makes it really awesome are the controls.  It's very easy to control what your rider is doing, and more than just being easy, it's FUN!!<br /><br />I've been enjoying the game for a few days now.  It runs very well on my Droid R2-D2 (Droid 2) and I would recommend it to anyone that likes racing games.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This album is completely devoid of commercial (sell) elements that came into effect during the South of Heaven and subsequent albums.  Its Slayer at their best with no BS..insane guitar and vocal speed with the classic distortion and signature Slayer sound.  Its their fastest effort and each song is a classic by itself.  I will add that if  you are an Abyss fan, you may not ike this one...its classic Slayer, not MTV Slayer.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|\\"Drive\\" is an extremely violent and disturbing movie.......in a gentle way.  The music is haunting with it's oddly slow tempo it's quietly underscores the despicable actions of the criminal underworld.  Ryan Gosling, all American pretty boy, is the `good' criminal.  He doesn't commit crimes he accompanies those who do by driving the get away car.  That's what he does by night, by day he's a stunt car driver.  The pacing gets a bit lugubrious since it never changes gears on the other hand that same pacing with its beautiful soundtrack lets you continue to hope that things will get better.  The cast includes Christina Hendricks of \\"Mad Man\\" fame as well as Brian Cranston from \\"Breaking Bad\\" who are both actors I admire.  Carey Mulligan was as good as always and the same goes for Albert Brooks in this against type role for him.  For me this contradictory movie never fulfilled its promise and there was a lot of promise.
0545425115|5.0|My English professor & a friend recommended this book to me so I went ahead and read it and I'm so glad I did because this is one of the best book I've ever read (The whole series is amazing). Absolutely LOVE it! I'm not a big reader myself but I already re-read this book at least 5 times.
B002JODUI4|5.0|I still can't believe that this CD came out after \\"Random Album Title\\" because the quality of the music in this album seems so much lower and simpler. Dont get me wrong, there are some great hits in the album like \\"Ghosts n stuff\\" \\"FML\\" and \\"Strobe\\" but other songs like \\"Bot\\" and \\"word problems\\" really suck.  But the good songs make this CD worth buying!  If you have never had a Deadmau5 CD before I would suggest you get \\"4x4=12\\" or \\"Random album title\\" before you get this cd because those CDs have more good songs in total than this CD.
B006UG90RM|3.0|A Different Kind of Truth is a welcome arrival. It came sooner than I expected. I'd just heard they had gotten back with DLR and boom, the CD was out. As soon as I get a CD, I load it onto iTunes and listen, rating each track on a five-star scale. Having gone through the CD a few times, I'm a little disappointed that none of the tracks reached a pure 5. But several tracks were good 4's: Tattoo, HoneyBabySweetieDoll, Stay Frosty, and Big River. So what's there to like:  1) Dave's back. I don't care if his voice is a little weaker or strained. His voice is the voice that goes with Van Halen. Sammy Hagar was great. And seriously, they made some great music with SH. But Dave is the voice. Showman, crazy-man, screamer--whatever. He captures an era with his voice. The way he sings, there's kind of a wink-wink, tongue-in-cheek, feel...as if to say, \\"Do you all have any idea how much FUN I'm having???\\" It's infectious.  2) Van Halen harmonies. Seriously, love the soaring harmony these guys have together. I'm a little surprise to hear it as I thought maybe Michael Anthony was a bigger part of that. I dunno.  3) Groove: Tattoo, Stay Frosty, and Big River definitely have a great, sludgy groove to them. They bring the soulful, chunky brown sound and turn it up to \\"eleven.\\"  4) Melody: Midway through Van Halen with Hagar and then esp. with Cherone, Van Halen seemed to forget that melody matters. It began to sound like it was more important for Eddie to show how technically brilliant  he is, rather than making music that is fun to listen too. This CD has the melody back. You will tap your foot. You will have echoes of the tune in your mind after turning off the music.  What's missing:  1) Originality: too many of the songs sound alike or sound like older songs. I heard echoes of Eruption, Take Your Whiskey Home, Ice Cream Man, Everybody Wants Some, Hot for Teacher, and more. I don't mean sonic reminders of that \\"sound.\\" Van Halen esp. with Dave, has a sound. And that's a good thing, a signature. But you can actually hear recycled riffs, rhythms, and fills throughout. It feels a little thin.  2) Extended Solos: Eddie was a wizard on guitar. Now, I know the guy's put himself through hell and back. Maybe he's just reached the extent of what he can still do. But I was hoping to hear that he'd adopted or created some new techniques and would just go crazy with some nice long, jaw-dropping solos. There's a cool one in \\"She's The Woman,\\" but maybe 15 seconds worth. {Sigh}  3) An Epic: Most VH CD's (sheesh, almost wrote Albums there) have at least a couple epic tracks, songs that you'll have on party mixes for...well, forever. This CD has a ton of good, but not much great, and nothing that you'll be pissed about if they don't do it in concert.  So there it is: If you're an old school VH fan, you'll be happy to add this to the collection. If you've become old and snobbish, you'll hate this. If you've gone a hundred new directions muscially since the 80's, hearing all kinds of innovative new stuff, you'll find just enough here to please, but not a ton more.
0307888908|5.0|Finally, a practical guide to taking control of your professional life in the Internet era. The authors lay out why a professional network matters and give succinct, relevant advice to building a cadre of collaborators and supporters that will be an asset for your entire career. Relevant examples from co-author Reid Hoffman's own experience as PayPal mafia member, LinkedIn founder, iconic angel investor and now venture capitalist add a little \\"insider\\" spice.  Highly recommended, especially for people in the early stages of their career. But it's good reading for everyone.
0060558121|1.0|From everything I have read, and everyone I have spoken to, it seems that I am one of the few people on the planet who did not enjoy this book. I am fan of Neil Gaiman, especially of his graphic novels, and of other works, including Neverwhere and Stardust. I enjoy darker-themed fiction.<br /><br />In addition to dark, however, I found this work to be dingy, depressing, and even occasionally disgusting. I had to force myself to continue on, and I simply found little to nothing redeemable in the experience.<br /><br />Others have described it as fascinating, haunting, and surreal. For me, it simply fell flat. There was no magic in the prose, and it felt sloppy, chopped up, and not as original as the back cover would lead one to believe. I didn't find a single character compelling enough to care about through the end of the book, or even to remember once I'd closed it.<br /><br />My recommendation on this one? Skip it.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I have seen Rush live 9 times. My first being the Hemispheres Tour in Los Angeles, my last being the Time Machine Tour in Charlotte, NC.  This video captures their humor, their virtuosity, their early days to their recent Caravan Tracks.  But most important, they do the whole of Moving Pictures.  They play Tom Sawyer to Vital Signs, straight thru, like the album.  For a real Rush fan, that is huge.  I guess you would call me an old school -> new school fan liking all, but more partial to Show Don't Tell and earlier, but I always love this band.  Watch the video, Beyond he Lighted Stage, as well as the outtakes.  You will learn to love this band.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Growing up, I read every Ray Bradbury book; and this was definitely in his style. I love a magical book, which is still grounded in reality but suggests .......... possibilities.
B004Z4M15Y|1.0|Unimaginative, angry, pleading, boring, mundane, violent, the book may capture the interior dialogue of its female characters, but being male I only know that Ms. Woolfe's male characters were utterly unconvincing.  Clearly, the Ramsey's are based on her own parents; and though this was written in 1927 and she drowned herself in the River Ouse in 1941, she foreshadows her suicide on almost every other page of this book.  How or why anyone would recommend it is beyond me.  Better to read Proust or Faulkner or Kathy Acker.<br />(Waterily and Ghostlily are illustrative of Woolfe's horrible diction and mindset, as are these parentheses).

B005T87QCI|3.0|I found the game to be just okay.  The graphics and sounds are nice, but the game really lacks depth.  There aren't a lot of characters or arenas, and the moves are pretty limited.<br /><br />With that said, it controls fairly well, so that's definitely a plus.  Maybe with an update, they can address some of the depth issues and introduce some more characters, combos, and arenas.
B004BSFSTA|5.0|I am very happy with my Marshall Headphones.  They are the coolest headphones I have ever owned, except for a certain pair from the 1970's (anyone remember those?)  In my opinion these headphones are worth the money.  Absolutely no regrets here! I'm also thinking about getting the Marshall earbuds, they are pretty cool too.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|What a surprising story. For most of the book, I thought it read like an autobiography and assumed it to be no more. Then came about the punch and I was so surprised, I did not see it coming.  I am very happy I read this book and have recommended it to others. Beautifully detailed!
0307408833|5.0|I am a huge fan of this baking cookbook.  I'm not vegan, nor have I ever eaten at a Babycakes bakery, but had this given to me as a gift and I just love it. The method of baking is quite different and takes a few tries to get it just right, but other than that, the recipes are awesome! Non-vegan/gluten-free people will never know the difference and may even prefer this kind of baking! I know I do!

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I saw the show in London and then twice in its reconfigured version in Melbourne, so you could say I am a fan. For me the best of Webber is Cats closely followed by Jesus Christ Superstar... and then this great piece. I prefer it to Phantom with its murderous madness. Probably the best thing about the show is the way the songs become emblazened in the mind. This used to happen quite frequently up to the mid 1970s but nowerdays is quite rare - things are so bland. Not this show and especially not the Melbourne version. Pointless to list the many great songs except perhaps to point out that 'Dear Old Friends' gets much better treatment in the revised version than the sarcastic original, and 'Ten Long Years' is more dramatic. The story line is much improved - the Phantom foxier - and the over-the-top number 'The Beauty Underneath' is rescued somewhat by the dramatic staging, which was incredibly effective on stage but loses some of its dramatic impact on Blu-Ray.  The Blu-Ray gives emphasis to the characters and has a close perspective. This works well as a representation of the fine acting and singing, but misses some of the drama of the incredible stage props. I cried the first time I heard the title song and found it highly moving and impressive in Melbourne, but on the disk the wonderful peacock stage is somewhat diminished. Anna O'Byrne as Christine is a new star of the stage, with her classically trained voice and noble profile creating a truly magnetic performance. And isn't the little boy remarkable? The disk is a worthy souvenier but probably also works well as an introduction for the novice.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is really well-done and so cute! I'm not sure how hard it gets, but you can restart each puzzle if you get stuck. Great job! Keep 'em coming...
B0000691U1|5.0|A real treat from 3 geniuses. Very rebellious in nature. Recorded in the 60's when racial turmoil was high in our nation. This reflects the attitude of jazz musicians, especially black jazz musicians, during this time in our history. Very powerful stuff here.

0385342063|5.0|It's so romantic and funny to find that sometimes a phone can do more than you expect and link two people together. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about a romantic comedy happening in this digital age, for more review please visit [...]
B005HSG3TC|2.0|All in all it does what it needs to do, the problem I have with it is that the stand is too flimsy and the interlocking points to keep it standing are too shallow. The stand would have been better if it had been designed with a deeper groove and multiple ones at that. The angle the stand provides is okay, but it would have been much better if there were multiple angle options.<br /><br />I would not recommend this stand/case.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|My kids and I absolutely LOVED this movie! The dancing penguins were really cute, both of my kids were standing up at the theatre and dancing (we went to the matinee with few people because I knew this would happen). I didn't feel like the propaganda took over this film, which is a big plus to me. I don't know why it's getting such bad reviews from others--you know it's a kid's movie, it does exactly what it should do.....entertain kids in a cute and fun way.
078324228X|3.0|The cinematic achievement, The Hurricane, is an inspiring story of Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter who is allegedly convicted for a triple homicide.  His journey through prison, his relationship with a boy bent on freeing him, and his subsequent exoneration all intertwine to create a powerful film that sheds light on police corruption, rampant racism, and innocent men locked behind prison bars.  Although the movie provides an entertaining story, the factual side of the story is wrongly portrayed.  Whether it was a move to allow the movie to become more gripping or whether it was a move of ignorance, the film's direction completely walks the line between reality and illusion.  Viewers who are subject to the film without previous knowledge of Carter's actual story may take what is given in the film as fact.  However, even though a disclaimer warns viewers of the fictionalized story, I believe that the film should've altered the story to make it its own, avoiding its warranted criticism.  If this move had been done, the movie would've been able to still stand on its own legs, all the while giving homage to Rubin Carter.  Fact and fiction aside, the seamless integration of two separate stories works well.  On one hand, Rubin's life in prison and back-story is explored extensively (albeit subjectively).  On the other hand, Lesra Martin, a fifteen-year-old boy, takes an interest in Rubin and progressively works to exonerate him.  Going back to my previous point, the story of Rubin almost seems subjective and forces the viewer to believe what the film would like the viewer to believe.  I found this frustrating as I would prefer to be able to decide on my own what to accept as true and what to accept as false.  The portrayal of the detective, Della Pesca, seemed to be a figurative \\"slap-in-the-face\\".  I feel as though his true character in real life probably wasn't so bent on locking up Rubin -- I may be wrong about this, but the film never gave me a chance to make my own opinion.All in all, The Hurricane is a fantastic piece of cinematic power.  The film packs a punch with an unrelenting glimpse into the racial prejudice common amongst Americans during that time period.  Denzel Washington's portrayal of Rubin Carter was haunting and as Washington pleaded with his lawyers, explaining that he had been locked up for thirty years, I received a chill, almost believing every single word the man said.  Forgetting the factual inaccuracies, this movie was one to be remembered and is certainly a cornerstone for rich storytelling.

B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter always felt sort of left out of the LEGO world.  She played a little with the freestyle brick set, but the sets that the boys get to build models from were just too boyish for her.  The Bellville line always looked a little too unchallenging, and never quite peaked her interest.  When I saw this line (ironically from reading a news story about feminists getting upset because these LEGOs involved things like beauty salons and domestic interests, rather than space adventures and deep sea exploration) I just knew my daughter would love the colors and the figures that come with the sets.  After receiving Olivia's Tree House, she built, demolished, and rebuilt the set again.  She can't stop enthusing over how much she loves these LEGOs, and she was so excited when I told her there were many more sets.  She even wants to part with some of her hard-earned allowance money (a rarity!) to buy another set.  Well done, LEGO!

0307959856|3.0|I should preface this review by saying that in general I am not a fan of mystery or suspense novels. I'm too impatient, too eager to know how it ends, too comfortable flipping to the last chapter long before I'm supposed to. So in general, I stay away from mysteries. This mystery, however, was billed by many reviewers and interviewers as one of the best Pride & Prejudice sequels out there. I am an avowed Jane Austen fanatic, so of course I had to try it out.<br /><br />As a mystery, I think this was a... satisfying read. On the eve of their biggest ball of the year, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy (and some guests) are surprised by the arrival of Lizzie's sister Lydia, shouting about gunshots in the woods and her fear that her husband George Wickham is dead. Darcy and Co. go out to investigate and find Wickham crouching over the bloody and definitely deceased body of his friend Denny. What follows is an account of the investigation, the trial of Mr. Wickham, and most interestingly (to me) how Darcy and Elizabeth deal with their part in the whole nasty affair. While reading I was never tempted to flip to the back and find out \\"whodunit\\", but I was always eager to keep reading and see what happened next.<br /><br />The book was a satisfactory sequel to Pride & Prejudice as well, although perhaps not as gush-worthy as some of the reviews I had read. P.D. James did a beautiful job expressing the police and legal systems of the time, her descriptions of the relationships between the various characters were thorough and lovely as well. The one thing I felt was missing from Death Comes to Pemberly as a P&P sequel was the joy and humor so prevalent in Austen's original. However, I recognize that \\"a mystery in the style of Jane Austen\\" may not necessarily need to have the same wit and humor; and that the inclusion of those things may actually detract from the mystery aspect of the story. Still, because I was reading this as an Austen fan and not a mystery fan, I was a little disappointed in the lack.<br /><br />I think if you are a mystery fan or a P.D. James fan you will love this book. If, however, you are an Austen fan, and reading it only for that reason, you should know that this is first and foremost a murder mystery, and temper your expectations accordingly.I think if you are a mystery fan or a P.D.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The plot reads like a Philip K. Dick novel.  A book about teens slaughtering other teens might give a 12 or 13 year old nightmares.  Hopefully it won't be made into a movie, but it probably will be. Reading about child murder is one thing, but seeing it would be intolerable. This isn't Tom Sawyer or even Harry Potter, the events portrayed in this book are brutal.  Although in many ways this book is a recycled SF book from the 1960's or 70's, what is exceptional about The Hunger Games is the development of the characters.  These are people that you really come to care about.  Even though the games are evil to the core, the people who put it on are not presented as bad people, nor is the protagonist without her flaws.  These are not comic book heroes and villains.  The action and suspense are relentless, even though the ending is predictable.  Pick this book up to read, and likely you'll end up finishing it at one sitting, and then go and download the next volume.  Which is exactly what this book is meant to do.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I managed to get this app when it was featured as the free app of the day (about a month ago).  Sooo thankful that I did!  Today it proved its usefulness!  Every once in a while, my wife calls me at work with a computer related issue at home.  It is often very difficult for me to walk her through the steps of resolving the issue without being able to see the screen.  She gets frustrated because she has to wait for me to get home before the issue is resolved (she is not technologically inclined).  Enter Splashtop on my Kindle Fire.  Today she called me with a simple issue.  I directed her to try something, but she couldn't find the control on the screen that I asked her to look for.  I pulled out my Kindle, started Splashtop, and located my computer.  Two clicks/taps, and her issue was resolved!  This is a VERY useful app.  It is worth noting, that I installed Splashtop Streamer on my PC (free), and set it up a while back so that Splashtop on my Kindle could find it (and use it) in just such an event.  I am grateful that this great app and a little forethought saved me a headache today.
B000ENV5WK|5.0|I love the movie cars and I have owned it since the day it was released.  I am also a huge fan of Jeremy Clarkson's work (Top Gear and such).  I was quite surprised to learn that the UK version of this film is exactly the same as the US version, with one exception.  Clarkson voices \\"Harv\\".  It is true and wonderful!  Thank you amazon, the interwebs and the UK... great combo!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lots of fun and it has multiple ways to play.This keeps it fun and challenging. It was well worth the price.
0439023483|2.0|I didn't like the first few chapters of \\"Hunger Games\\" - the premise being too barbaric for me and the thought of young kids reading this and enjoying it bothers me. I can't get past other \\"popular\\" novels like the Stephen King one.  Where oh where is a really well written, good story book?
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game grabbed me from the load screen. I played way more than I intended to on my first play, and can't wait to explore more of this adorable gem!
B001E45XT4|5.0|This is a great headset for the price. This headset is loud and clear. It should say PC headset in the description however because it comes with no adapter for Xbox or PS3. I am very satisfied with this product.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Dylan, Cash, Tom Jones...Leonard Cohen. This is Cohen's poetic brilliance brought to bear on the end of life and eternal things. I thought the music was great, and I can listen to Leonard's lyrics all day. Favorites are Come Healing, Darkness, Show Me the Place, and Going Home.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved this book!! I love the military and I have so much respect for everything they do. Reading Chirs's book gave people a very tiny insight to how it must be in a war every day is tough and every decision is tough. This is the first book I have read and I loved it. I finished it earlier this afternoon and was very sad that I did.   After reading a few pages I found I couldn't put it down. I would like to get it signed but living in the UK I don't think that would happen :( which is quite sad as I would love to meet this guy...from reading this book he does sound pretty amazing guys like him and his friends are very few and far between so it's always good to know there are still people in this would that would sacrifice there lives for complete strangers even those that might bad mouth them. Chris if you read this Write another book!!!... anyway as I said I really enjoyed it and was very sad to finish I loved it that much... so buy it, read it and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.
B0064MT1NU|1.0|This blu ray does not include subtitles which existed in the theatrical release. Maori dialogue remains untranslated; idiosyncratic sign language is likewise left for you to decipher on your own. Because of this appalling oversight, the emotional weight of the film is greatly reduced. Do not buy this truncated version of the film. It is extremely disappointing.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Got it as the free app of the day on my Kindle Fire and I am really happy I did. Cute graphics, quick loading, fun for everyone kind of game!
0385342063|5.0|A real page turner; a cheery tale about the attraction of opposites just right for Valentine's Day. A physiotherapist who's at an engagement party with her girlfriends loses her engagement ring and finds an abandoned cell phone -- and in the search to get the ring back and sort out all the information that the telephone brings her, she finds something entirely unexpected.  What I loved about this was the peppy energy of the heroine -- she's not perfect, and she's trying to figure out just how assertive she needs to be, and where her place could be in the constellation of her fiancé's family -- and the verve with which she rushes in where angels fear to tread. The plot, although entirely predictable (phone as deux ex machina), was also tremendously funny and enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome to waste time with. the games are a lot of fun though and worth the download. fun fun fun
B006ISJQBM|4.0|First let me say, even if I wasn't a Depp fan I would say this movie is at least watchable, but probably not going to be your favorite. Like many other reviewers mentioned this movie is nothing like Fear and Loathing. Which for me is much better. It has always been one of my least favorites and is one of the few Depp movies I do not own. I will also agree that this movie does seem too long for what it is. There are definitely some parts that drag on. Sometimes I wonder if it's just because we've come to expect movies to be full action all the time or if it really does just drag on. Some of the older movies that were classics seem to drag on to me, so who really knows.<br /><br />I will say that felt that Depp's performance was stellar in this movie, as are with all his movies. So, if you like his stuff you will probably like this movie. I'm not really a fan of Amber Heard but I thought her performance was good as well. To me if it wasn't for her and Paul Kemp's (Depp) relationship in the movie it would have been a complete bore. The guy Kemp rooms with also has some pretty good scenes with him that give the movie some humor.<br /><br />Truthfully, I felt as if Moberg's character just brought the movie down. Some of the lines his character says was offensive and honestly pathetic. I understand he was suppose to be a drunk wild man and he was just portraying that. I still just found myself really disliking the character. I've even seen Giovanni Ribisi in other movies and thought he was great, but I just didn't like Moberg. I would even go as far to say that if his character had been left out of the movie I would probably have rated this movie five stars.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you are debating buying part one of Wool, or buying the omnibus edition, then let me make it easy for you:  Buy the omnibus.  Wool 1 will certainly draw you in, but it is a self-contained story that stands on its own merits.  If you're looking for just one well-done novella, then part-one will satisfy that requirement and then some, and it just might be possible to stop reading there, but most likely, you won't, and that's where the Omnibus comes in, especially if you just want to dip your toe in the water, and see if you like the series.  Because if you're just browsing, and start with Wool, then you're going to read Wool 2, and that is where you are going to be lost, because you cannot read Wool 2 without reading 3, 4 and 5.  They're that good.  Wool 2, Proper Gauge, goes into the world that Howey has created and draws you into it with the most fully-realized visualization of a fictional society since Edgar Rice Burroughs gave us Barsoom, but then also gives the reader a sympathetic lead character and the inklings of a darkness in the silo that has nothing to do with the absence of sunlight.  By the time you finish book 2, you will be hooked, and the cliffhanger ending of 3, the Unraveling, will propel you into 4 and 5 before you know what hit you.  So, why buy the Omnibus?  Two reasons:  First, you'll save money, and second, you'll save time.  You'll pay more for each installment separately (5 is $2.99), and when you finish 3, you won't want to wait for 4 or 5.<br /><br />Buy the omnibus.  It's a bargain.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I have read positive and negative reviews of this item.  First I want to address the lack of Blu Ray for this set.  Many fans have expressed disappointment, and the studio has given their reasons (or excuses, depending on your take) for sticking to DVD.  For me, DVD is okay because the Blu Ray player within my PS3 upconverts very well.  The quality is amazing.  Also, I can only imagine how much more this set would cost if it were on Blu Ray.  The second thing I want to address is the quality of this package.  It is absolutely astounding.  The set weighs just over nine pounds.  As previously stated the beautiful blue box comes with two beautiful hardcover books within.  Seasons one through five in the first volume and seasons six through ten in volume two.  The discs are redesigned and the pages that hold the discs are full of vibrant scenes from the series.  Additionally there's a beautiful envelope that includes an awesomely detailed episode guide full of color photos as well as a fully produced copy of The Daily Planet.  It actually smells like a newspaper.  Many reviewers have expressed dismay at how the discs are held.  This was not really a problem for me because another boxed set I recently purchased from Amazon (the newer Sex And The City Complete Series set, the white set that includes the movies) has its discs held in the same fashion.  I have a recommendation.  Use a Kleenex (to prevent smudging) to remove your discs the first few times you play them. Also, a use a couple of sprays of compressed air to loosen the paper/cardboard sleeves a bit.  This may sound like a bit of a hassle, but you have to consider why you are buying this set and who you are buying it for.  This is not a set for teenagers or children.  This is a set for collectors - adults or teenagers who actually know how to take care of things.  I just received the set today but I have pulled out every disc; there are some minor scratches on four discs but I have a disc repair kit and the scratches aren't deep - so I'm not worried.  I am thoroughly impressed with the amount of care the studio put into this set.  Few series get this treatment.  'Sex and the City' received this treatment twice; as previously noted I own the newer white boxed set with the same cardboard disc holders.  'Charmed' is another series that received this treatment, although that set did have problems with its discs (I was one of the lucky ones who did not).  I highly recommend this purchase.  Amazon sells it for $199.00.  I saw it in Target for $249.99.  You can't beat the Amazon price!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was very fin but its really hard to unlock them and not all of the ham s are fin that's my opinion but try it
0316056863|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, especially her journey at SNL. She goes into great depth about her Sarah Palin sketch which I found very interesting. Her insight into the writing of each SNL skit gave me a new appreciation for the show.  I would have liked her to go into more detail about her experience writing Mean Girls because I loved the movie.  Great insight into the world of women leaders in the workplace as well.  Overall: Funny, Light and an Easy Read.  PS I liked Mindy Kaling's [very similar] book book better because I laughed out loud almost every page. Tina has more sophisticated humor, in comparison.
B000H1QQIW|2.0|I'm not sure if this is a fair review,,, the seller did send it in a timely matter... it was new like it said and it was fairly priced. I bought it for a friend who brought it back to me saying... it won't play on our player, It has a code lock on it. So I don't know what I can do.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|The only thing I really liked about the movie was Ryan Gosling and Carrie Mulligan. Ryan can do no wrong. Yet again, his acting is clean, crisp, and on-point.  However, the story-line is kind of flat and there was too much gore and blood for my liking.  Overall, good acting but not a great story-line.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing Solitaire. Once I start playing it's hard for me to stop. I play almost everyday. I always say, this is my last game, but I always play more.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|After installing it just force-closed, but rebooting fixed that - kudos to the devs for noticing my complaint and emailing advice to reboot and retry.  Good graphics and quite polished game overall, but the game itself just didn't hold my interest for long.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Yes, some levels are very difficult. But that's what makes a good puzzle game great. Stick with it, it's worth it.
B003TML0VO|5.0|First of all, I don't have a long history of listening to Carlos Santana's music. In fact, this is my first Santana purchase and I have to admit that I purchased it on a whim. Generally, I enjoy cover albums and the title grabbed me. While this album isn't perfect, I have to say that I am really enjoying it. I have a six disc changer in my car and this CD has been it in for the past several months.<br /><br />I think the guitar work is consistently excellent throughout the CD. Because he uses different singers, I think what makes or breaks each individual song is the ability of the vocalist. For example, the vocalist for the Bang a Gong cover is just awful. I don't listen to that song because I can't get past the bad vocals. Also, there are a couple of tracks that just have no business being on a CD with the phrase \\"Greatest Guitar Classics\\" in it.<br /><br />In my opinion, I would rate the tracks as follows:<br /><br />The Best:<br />1. Whole Lotta Love - Does justice to a great Zeppelin tune<br />2. Sunshine of Your Love<br />3. Photograph - I can see some people not liking this because of Chris Daughtry. If you forget about American Idol and give this song a fair listen, I think you'll like it.<br />4. Smoke on the Water - Possibly the best guitar riff ever.<br />5. Little Wing - I have never liked Joe Cocker's music but I love his vocals on this song. His singing style and sound fit this song perfectly.<br />6. I Ain't Superstitious - I'm a huge Jonny Lang fan so naturally I think this is a good one.<br /><br />The Good:<br />1. Can You Hear Me Knocking<br />2. While My Guitar Gently Weeps - This is a good cover but I think Jeff Healey covered it better.<br />3. Back in Black - I hated this song the first time I listed to it but, it has grown on me. It would be better if the annoying background singers were removed.<br />4. Riders in the Storm - I'm not a Doors fan so that probably explains why I don't listen to this one as much. I suspect that Doors fans reallylike this track.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />1. Dance the Night Away - This is not a good Van Halen song to cover on a CD entitled \\"Guitar Heaven\\". I wished Santana had picked a different Van Halen song to include.<br />2. Bang a Gong - I have no idea why anyone would think covering this song is a good idea. Honestly, the song is boring to listen to. Additionally, this is without a doubt the weakest vocal on the CD.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I consistently listen to ten out of the twelve tracks on this CD. What more can you ask for out of a CD?
0307352145|5.0|I have actually never written a review on Amazon before, but I feel compelled by the overwhelmingly positive experience of reading this book to share with others how awesome it is!! I would not be exaggerating if I said that it is among the best books I have ever read, and I have read many hundreds, if not thousands, of wonderful books! This is one of those rare ones that is actually life-changing. It has given me a whole new way of looking at myself, my life, and other people. Every page, every paragraph, is filled with the author's incomparable warmth, wisdom, and wit. It is at once entertaining and insightful, brilliant, even! Compassionate, balanced, reflective, comprehensive, surprising, engaging, delightful- the list of adjectives I could use to describe this book is endless! I want everyone I know (and everyone I don't know) to read it! I guarantee that you will not be disappointed (even after I have set your expectations so high with this glowing review). Ms. Cain seems like an amazing person, and she has given so much to the world, and to me, personally, in writing this book! She truly practices what she preaches here by having found and fulfilled her unique way of using her talents to contribute. I hope that this book will be recognized for the treasure it is. There is so much more I could say, but I would rather have you stop reading my words and start reading hers- so go to it!

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|If you are looking for a film that includes good gritty action and non-stop car driving look elsewhere. This film has its moments and one or two kill scenes that are pretty good but the title is misleading. I was expecting some \\"Bullet\\" car scenes or at best \\"Transporter\\" driving action; this movie is not for the fan of car driving/chase scenes. It's slow, sludgy and it's cleverly disguised as an action film when in reality it's a romance story. No \\"Whiteline Fever\\" scenes, no \\"Live and Die in L.A.\\" commitment to the chase ... even Fast and Furious had better action behind the wheel! NOT A GUYS FILM for certain; if you want to share a movie with your girl and don't want to include Jennifer Anniston on the screen then here you go!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|New college grad Skeeter Phelan comes home to Jackson, bent on starting a career as a writer. Her friends welcome her back, but Skeeter's changed in ways that they have not.  For one thing, Mississippi in the 1960's was a hotbed of racial segregation, and Skeeter's no longer comfortable with that. Her first summer home, she observes the way her friends (mis)treat their black maids, and, gradually, convinces some of the maids to talk to her about their lives, about which Skeeter knows very little. Soon, she has a publisher interested in compiling those interviews into a book.<br /><br />The Help is written and directed by Tate Taylor, who elicited fine performances from his primarily female cast. Viola Davis, as the maid Aibilene, is the lynchpin that holds the story together, showing depths of carefully modulated  dignity, strength, and emotion in her dealings with employers and friends alike. The other standout is Jessica Chastain,  who plays the  white trash bombshell who snagged the town's most eligible bachelor and is shunned by everyone but Skeeter. Her ability to project vulnerability and honesty without pathos is awesome. Bryce Dallas Howard, in the thankless role of beautiful, dyed-in-the-wool racist and social leader Hilly,  personifies the ugliness of the racial situation with aplomb. Emma Stone represents those looked their consciences square in the face and took up the banner in the civil rights movement, and as Skeeter, shows how much courage was necessary in that dangerous environment.<br /><br />The Help  has taken a lot of critical flak from folks who have an ax to grind about how it presents the issue of segregation. But, first and foremost, The Help is a movie, based upon a novel,  not a sociological treatise. It's intelligent, thought provoking entertainment.  It shows how things were, and in many cases, still are, and if it brings awareness to the minds of people who weren't yet born during the 60's, it's done its job. (I liked it better than the book.)
B005T87QCI|2.0|it took me like 5 minuits to beat the game. WAY to short. if they add more levels and robots I will rate it higher
0195067142|5.0|What a powerful re-creation of his experiences during WWII. I've read many war books, including China Marine, but this has to be the most powerful and gut wrenching of them all. I see one reviewer who said \\"kind of boring\\", not sure what book that person was reading but it was not With the Old Breed. This book had me cheering, crying, shaking my head, sent chills down my spine and on the verge of vomiting. In the end I had one thought in my mind, God Bless the United States Marines!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH. Yes I gotvit when it was the free app of the day but I would buy it on the spot in a heart beat. GOOD game keeps you unbored. I RECOMMENED IT!
B003B02PF4|2.0|My biggest complaint about this book is that at least five more chapters are needed to complete the book, at a very minimum.  The ending is simply missing. Major characters were introduced and then their story lines were abandoned, leaving too much unresolved.  It really reads more like a rough draft then a completed work.  Really a shoddy effort. Give this one a pass.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book is a real eye opener. Everybody, religious or not, should read this book. The world would be a much different, much better place if people stopped believing in fairy tales and invested all that time, energy, and money in more productive things and not in religion. There would also be fewer wars and major world conflicts if there were no religions. EXCELLENT BOOK! Thank you Mr. Dawkins!!!!!!!

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been told on some of the forums that you cannot sync kindle fire with your google calendar. This app does it perfectly for me. It even syncs up with my Business Cal on my android phone. They all sync perfectly and automatically with this app.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is one of my favortie movies now. I know a lot of birders that are just like this. It was hilarious and I wish they would make more movies like it!!
B006ZEDZNY|4.0|To appreciate the quality of this rambling little film that is actually based on an episode in the life of Hunter S. Thompson the following biographical information is helpful: `Hunter Stockton Thompson (1937 - 2005) was an American journalist and author who wrote The Rum Diary (published in1998), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971), Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 (1973), The Curse of Lono (1983), and Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1966). He is credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the action to such a degree that they become central figures of their stories. He is known also for his lifelong use of alcohol, LSD, mescaline, and cocaine (among other substances); his love of firearms; his inveterate hatred of Richard Nixon; and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. In 1960 Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rico English-language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor. While suffering a bout of health problems, he committed suicide in 2005 at the age of 67.'<br /><br />In the film version of Thompson's autobiographical book, Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean under toupeed editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). He is accompanied by the staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli), the drunken staff writer Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) in his discovery of the many wonders of Puerto Rico, not the least of which is a group of entrepreneurs lead by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) - who happens to be living with the stunning Chenault (Amber Heard) who Paul is attracted to - and a series of disreputable business men bent on `touristifyng' a neighboring island.  Paul is a drunk and finds innumerable distractions and challenges as he tries to worm his way through the playing field of lost souls.<br /><br />The story is Hunter S. Thompson all the way and Bruce Robinson has adapted Thompson's book in much the same way the novelist communicates: Robinson also directs. Depp, as usual, manages to make the strange lead character not only interesting but also ingratiating.  The supporting cast is solid. The film gets off track many times, but as pure entertainment it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours watching Depp create another memorable character based on life!

B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great puzzle app.  Makes you think, but not too difficult.  Cute characters(?!) make it fun for the kids.  Would recommend for kindle fire users.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very cool this game is really cool because you get a big choice of games to play hi hi hi hi
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is great and very addictive it was the very first game I got and what I realy like is that I can play with no wifi connection everyone should have it:)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|one of the best game/games i ever played. Its challenging but still fun. I enjoy it very much. its one  those games you could play all day. it works perfectly on my kindle fire.
0316113506|5.0|Excellent book for anyone who's interested in improving his/her brain power and physical strength.  Yes, they are related - and the book gives ample example and convincing evidence.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I almost didn't get this app because the picture on it looked like a kid's game. Wrong! This is a game for all ages! Adults will love Bag It too! Works beautifully on my Kindle Fire. There is only one thing wrong - you become horribly hooked on the game before you get out of level one! You have been warned!  Enjoy. It's a great game.  (You can thank me later.)
B0068MNO4S|3.0|First of all this movie really tries very hard to sell the idea that someone else<br />besides Shakespeare wrote his works. In fact it tries perhaps just a little too hard. Yes the story is presented reasonbly well, all the actors do a fine job but<br />there are problems. The movie makes many inferences that it would be nice to be able to see a little more proof to back them up. Warning Spoilers ahead! First that the queen had a number of children out of wedlock. That Two of the earls were among them, that she had a relationship with at least two of them unknowingly commiting incest with them. That Shakespeare was actually some sort of special illiterate who took advantage of the earls need of silence and to remain anonymous since if the queen and the court knew that he was the author could have sent him to the tower or at least could have cost him his position at court. There are a number of other inferences in the film, but I will not discuss them here. Though it is interesting that there are no available examples of Shakespeare's or the Earl's works. I found it interesting that the film makers mixed a fair amount of the historical truth in the story. Such as the burning of the Globe Theater, The events surrounding Exxex,<br />the death of the queen, and death of Christopher Marlow. No I don't believe that Shakespear killed him, but he did die mysteriously. The film is a good effort to tell an interesting story. Do I believe any of it to be completely true? No. Is it possible? Yes. But I have my doubts.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|Honestly after watching the 1st one I don't know why I even bothered to rend this one. Almost exactly the same story line guy grabs camera after strange things start happening..blah blah blah.  Low Budget film.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|like this game. from easy to hard  you challenge awaits you. I enjoy this game play chess free daily. have gun playing chess
B006PHD0RW|5.0|An extremely fun, addictive game for Kindle Fire. Works perfectly. Got it for free but would definitely pay for it. Highly recommended.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Just like the original, but with a little twist. There are updates available according to the time of year. That keeps the game fresh!
B006YXTRHY|1.0|The kindest thing I can say about this film is that at least Edward looks less like a mime than before. Bella is as expressionless, dull-witted, and boring as ever. Jacob is the heart of the entire film; without him, there would be absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The end was surprising in that (warning: spoiler) Jacob imprinted upon Bella and Edward's newborn, thus assuring her safety from the supposedly murderous wolf pack who manage to somehow come across as pretty cool even though they're supposed to be the bad guys.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this  game is addicting.took me off word's with friends. also kept me occupied for breaks and lunches at work.intact got others. hooked too
B006IGZWB2|2.0|This movie made wanted me to dip my head in a bucket of acid and my head was throbbing like a lemon being crushed with a monster truck being run over a 17 million directions ugh it was god awful
B006PHD0RW|3.0|looks like a fun game but the touch option is irresponsive, very upsetting.  don't recommend for the HTC incredible 2
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I understand having ads, however is it really necessary to have them IN GAME? When all the games require touching all over the screen and you have to also dodge ads.....very annoying.  UNINSTALLING
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I was on the road to unemployment, again, for poor performence. I got this training tool app and I am now the top bag specialist in my town.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like how u can change versions from the King James to the NIV. I also like the highlight tool. it helps me keep track of my fav verses.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|We thought that the movie was slow and the direction sloppy. On the other hand, the book was much deeper and more complete. I would skip the movie and read the book, or get it as an audiobook and listen to it. I do recommend the story, but not the on-screen version.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|someone gave this game a bad review because it didn't work on their mopho. it does in fact work without any problems. the game itself is fun.
0793563836|5.0|Great book to learn how to read.  I haven't read for 25 years and this was a great book for me to relearn.  Goes from the very basics right into 16th notes and then on to the rudiments of slapping.  Many different types of grooves with play-a-long CDs that help you get the feel of the music rather than just playing it flat.  Definately an adult book that moves pretty fast. So, you won't be bored.  Intersting pieces as well. I'm moving on to Carol Kaye book 2.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|but no instructions for games. but lots to do and some are challenging so a waste of time (as in I lost time playing) but not a waste of space.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Now that the update is in place (which it has been for a while) , this game is a lot of fun. Gameloft makes some killer games. You get 3 months of free play and only costs $3 per 6 months after your trial period is over. That's darn cheap for an MMO. Of course you can cancel anytime. Nothing to lose really. Give it a try.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|So much fun. Accidentally found it looking for other apps and downloaded it just because it was free. I'm glad I did.  It is very challenging but great when I get a new element.
B004OYDVT0|5.0|I am an eclectic  audiophile and purchased this album about a year ago and have listened to its entirety over and over to the point of boredom. I had filed her away, but recently burned a copy for my fiance', who instantly fell in love with Adele...and now I have fallen in love with her all over again. So I pulled out her album again, and am on the second wind of playing her over and over again.  I felt motivated to write a review by some negative reviews.   I heartily disagree with some viewers' comments that every song on this album is whiny.   Quite the contrary, this album runs the gamut of emotions, much like the life-cycle of a relationship: ecstasy, torment, anger, resolve, and acceptance.  This album will be timeless and one of those albums that I would want to have with me if I happen to be stranded on an island. Pure artistry and raw talent. no gimmicks of vocal synthesization via computers- which is refreshing in an age of lip synch and computerized music.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|One of the better deals of the day in quite awhile. If you want to bag items for a living, passing the first few chapters of this game should be mandatory!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the spirit of God comes through His word! this app is great for in depth reading, sticking to reading plans or for just browsing. seek God's voice in these pages and He will reveal His love for you!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was an amazing movie: every man needs to see this!  Great plot, great characters, great values, and the best action yet from Sherwood Pictures. I refuse to acknowledge the PG-13 rating. I'm of the opinion that it's a PG movie (some non-graphic police-gang chases/fighting and a couple drug references) that got booted to a PG-13 for religion (the novelization by Randy Alcorn, on the other hand is more PG-13 in that he puts in a lot of extra stuff not in the movie (more drug references, some more violence), but there are also less safe books out there). That's not to say that every five-year-old necessarily needs to see this film for at least a couple years, depending on what kind of movies they can handle already (for example, if they're already watching Lord of the Rings, then Courageous is a piece of cake).
B002ZG98FU|1.0|Further proof that finding a decent comedy nowadays is like finding Bigfoot.  Where do I start with this steaming pile of convoluted cow dung. The adorable Rachel Mcadams plays a morning show tv producer who has just been given the axe by her employers.  She is quickly hired by a much less respected network and sets out to pull this faltering news show out of the dumps.  Now that I have given a general synopsis I will continue to do what I had originaly intended to do here, completely trash this abysmal train wreck of a movie that stole nearly 2 hours of my life.  Mcadams is about as appealing as a chiuaua on speed in this movie,  she jumps around, chatters endlessly and knocks things over.  It was cute for about 10 minutes but got exhausting fast.  Enter the great Dianne Keaton, a foul mouthed news anchor who's less than satisfied with her role at the network,  she is given little to do here and gives the \\"hey as long as the check clears\\" impression.  We are then introduced to a character played by the usually dependable Harrison Ford, a gruff sarcastic highly esteemed news anchor who feels this network is beneath him, hey maybe thats a parable about this whole movie being beneath him.  The absolute worse thing about Morning Glory are the endless movie cliche's.  This was as predictical as movies get, not helped by annoying songs interspresed with scenes that were more jarring than feel good.  I wont even go into the forced love story subplot involving another coworker (Patrick Wilson in a completely thankless role).  What pisses me off the most about this movie is that this could have been a great movie.  You have the talents of Keaton and Ford playing bickering news anchors and with some good writing could have been comic gold! instead we are treated to a juvenile been thier done that a million times so called \\"rom com\\" that started decent then got bad then got horrible!  There was a point where me and the person I was watching with decided to play spot the movieclich'e, and if we would have made it a drinking game I would problaly be to trashed to write this review.
1451627289|5.0|Finished 11/22/63 tonight and sobbed my way through the last pages. Bravo, Mr. King! This novel has now moved to the #2 spot on my list of favorite Stephen King books, just thismuch below The Stand. Superb. As close to perfection as you can get. If you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and get a copy. The story is about time-travel, but in the end it's what King's finest novels are always about: love. And what a wonderful, touching, amazing love story it is.
