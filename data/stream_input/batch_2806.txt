B00DM12ANO|3.0|(small spoilers)<br />IMHO, Sci-Fi movies that sell a relationship as the overriding plot theme tend to fail in that regard almost every time on selling the theme. In this instance, as stated in the opening credits, the love theme overrides the laws of gravity (&#34;changes the world&#34;) as they relate to the worlds presented to us.  In addition to basically ignoring these laws from the outset, except where it conveniently fits the story line, the movie fails to present the chemistry between Dunst and Sturgess to sell that premise.  A good job is done in with the effects and some great ideas about how such a world may work in particular practical purposes and is worth seeing for that alone.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was looking for excel and word document for my Kindle Fire.  This one is the best.  I loaded a printer-  HP ePrint -  and I made an excel sheet and printed it.  You can't print from the excel sheet itself, you have to go to HP ePrint and find the file and print. I couldn't believe it worked!  It was easy.  Just read and follow the directions on the screen.  This is a great app to have on your Kindle Fire.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really good for testing your skills, I like it a lot!<br />If your looking for a tricky game I'd consider you buying this game
B0055SWM08|4.0|I would have given the game 5 stars if the tutorial was Little more precise.  This is a very challenging game and keeps you on your toes.  There are no time limit to each level, and the music is very relaxing. So you are not trying to beat the clock.<br />Actually the game is a great stress reliever, as long as you are patient you can  proceed to the next level.  If you are stuck, you can always get a hint for 2-3 coins.  The other nice thing is if you make a wrong move you can start over, on that particular puzzle.

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|The author was able to capture my attention in the very first page of his work, then kept the pages turning right to the very end. He touches upon a delicate thing that few books dare expose: the sins of the father visited on the children. The profound repercussions of a crime as described in this novel become inbedded in the lives of the criminal's progeny in many subtle ways. The author has the literary skill to bring these deep wounds to the surface and weave them into his narrative. This is certainly one of the best works I have read this year!

1607066017|5.0|It's not often I get into a graphic novel. But Saga immediately caught my eye because of the interesting artwork and the blatant mature themes. I'm not one for wishy-washy stories and the dialogue, as well a the actions, were rather intense. I like that about a story. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes the more mature themed graphic novels.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Gaiman is great.  American Gods is incredibly good, but long form.  I liked Neverwhere one star better, but Ocean is quite entertaining.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I haven't tried all the alarm apps, but this one is great, plus I got it for free from amazon free apps of the day.
B004X4R3FE|5.0|Loved it! I watched with my 10-year-old son, and found that it included many historical events that I needed to explain for him to really understand, but the second time through he enjoyed it too. Looked up George VI afterwards and found that a trove of papers had been released in 2002-03. Much of the info about the situation (e.g. Simpson's other lover was a car dealer) seems to have come from those papers.<br />The only reason I could see for the rating was language. They were all words my son had already heard, and they are clearly used as a way to untie the king's tongue. I don't think it did him any harm to hear them in that way. I think the message of persisting and overcoming did him a lot of good.

B00B81B0HC|1.0|The title should say it all, but let me elaborate. It took two listens of this album to figure out exactly what this music is supposed to be.<br /><br />The music takes you back to the magical time when Linkin Park was popular, a band popular at the end of the rap/metal fusion era of the late nineties. Slow beats, nearly spoken lyrics, then an upbeat chorus with yelling. Repeat for fifteen tracks = profit. The lyrics are like every slow-motion teaser clip of a dramatic t.v. show where the main character is making a tough choice and the soundtrack is playing thematic inspirational music with vocals like ''I won't ever change!''<br /><br />Despite a compelling use of handclaps, Imagine Dragons is fifteen years worth of too late garbage.

I would call it a fantasy linked to reality.  The magic in this world has it's limits and consequences just like any thing in real life does.  I love it so much I have it on my kindle and I own a hard copy.  It is a great young-adult book, because it can be enjoyed by teens and adults alike.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|50,000,000 Frenchmen can't be wrong, nor a whole bunch of Amazon reviewers.  This is my favorite calendar app, but Amazon's insistence that one be logged in to Amazon makes it DANGEROUS!  I don't mind being logged into Amazon.  The problem is figuring out when the app will decide that you are not.  Most of the time it works flawlessly, but twice now I've had it bar me from scheduling and entering a new MEDICAL APPOINTMENT.  Doctors' offices are busy places.  They're the last place I want to have to be putting people on hold while I try to figure out how to log back into Amazon.  Yesterday was the last straw.  Even though, as the Amazon Verified Purchase tag  verifies, I already have this app through Amazon, I purchased it through Google Play.

B000028U0Y|5.0|At Folsom Prison is both the easiest and hardest of Johnny Cash's albums to review.  Easy because if you only own one Cash album, it's this one.  In fact, if you only own one country album, or perhaps even only one live album, this is the one.  Simply put, this record encapsulates everything there is to know about Cash - the rebel, the country boy, the lover, the loser, the entertainer and the religious devotee.  The performances are raw and visceral, yet tender and personal at the same time.  From start to finish, the album is bursting with electricity.<br /><br />The hard part comes in getting to what makes this album so special.  From start to finish, there's not a dull track.  Recorded live in California's infamous Folsom Prison, Johnny actually played two sets that day, one in the morning, the other around lunch time.  Here Cash is backed by his regular touring entourage: The Tennessee Three (Marshall Grant, WS Holland and Luther Perkins), his girlfriend (and soon to be fiancée, then wife) June Carter, the Statler Brothers.  Years on the road with this group meant they were comfortable playing together even if it was first thing in the morning in front of a group of convicts.  The recent of addition Carl \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" Perkins on guitar alongside Luther (unrelated) meant some hot licks could be expected on top of the Three's steadfast boom-chicka-boom backing.<br /><br />The first set features just Johnny and the Tennessee Three.  Not surprisingly, they come blazing out of the gate with Cash's early hit, Folsom Prison Blues, and here it bristles and cracks with violence appropriate for a song about shooting a man just to watch him die.  In an instant, they have spun around for a couple of ballads - Dark as the Dungeon which applies equally to prisoners as it does to coal moaners, and the soft longing of I Still Miss Someone - which are played with such emotion that it's hard to imagine even this rough-and-tumble audience losing attention for even a moment.He then rips into Cocaine Blues which is so fiery it makes his 1960 studio recording (the censored Transfusion Blues) entirely irrelevant, and then has the gall to sing the brutally dark-humoured gallows tale, 25 Minutes to Go, to a room full of convicts. They don't seem to mind, in fact, they absolutely love it, cheering at every spare moment in the music.  Only then do they take a moment's rest, long enough for Johnny to joke about playing the \\"harmoni-cai\\" for their 1965 hit Orange Blossom Special.  Again, they wipe the floor with the studio version, Holland's drums whip-cracking like a runaway train.<br /><br />From there, the band is dismissed and Johnny plays a few tunes on his acoustic guitar.  The heartbreak is palpable in the Long Black Veil (another gallows tune!), and Send a Picture of Mother (another prison tune!), and yet it seems entirely natural for him to crack jokes about the prison's drinking water.  Cash had a magical ability to bridge the reverent and the ridiculous, and his charm very quickly wins the audience over.  The acoustic set continues with the prison escape tale The Wall, and the hilarious Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog and the then-unreleased Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart.  By now, the audience is eating out of Cash's hand!<br /><br />The band returns for a duet with June, the tempestuous cheatin' tune, Jackson. Johnny and June had an incredible rapport on stage and you can imagine how the prisoners would react to such a beautiful, feisty woman teasing Johnny mere feet from them!<br /><br />He then begins rounding third base.  First it's the tender Give My Love to Rose, followed by the upbeat hit prison lament, I Got Stripes.  Incredibly, stripped of the big studio echo, the Statler Brothers actually sound good behind Cash.  The concert then ends on a meditative note, first with the reminiscent Green, Green Grass of Home, and finally with a song Cash wrote by putting to words a lyric written by one of the prisoners: Greystone Chapel.  Having gone through an epiphany of his own only a year earlier, following a near suicide, he sings a convict's revelation: \\"Inside the walls of prison my body may be/but the Lord has set my soul free.\\" On this last track, everyone's clapping, the band is singing, and Carl's playing some rocking lead, turning a prison cafeteria into a religious revival if only for a few, fleeting minutes.  With a brief instrumental and some closing announcements from the Warden, the prisoners are sent back to their cells, and the whole thing is forgotten.  Except that it's not.  Newly sober and reinvigorated, Johnny had the foresight to bring in the adventuresome Bob Johnston to record this concert and make sure it would last forever.  Thank God he did.<br /><br />A few notes about the reissues:<br /><br />1999 Legacy Edition - In 1999, the album was re-released with several bonus tracks.  These include a great version of Busted, an acoustic Joe Bean, a full-band version of John Henry's Hammer played by request, plus some salty dialogue inappropriate for a 1968 release.  These only make a perfect album better.<br /><br />2008 Legacy Box Set - In 2008, the album was released again as a two-disc set revealing the bigger picture behind the concert.  What Sony has provided are both the morning and noon-hour sets in their entirety, and they play quite differently from the edited live album.  Instead of a straight Cash concert, we get the full travelling roadshow feel of his performances.  The first concert opens with Carl Perkins playing Blue Suede Shoes, followed by a Statler Brothers number.  The crowd suitably warmed up, Cash comes out for a 19-song set, most of which was used for the album.  Left out is a great version of Hank Snow's \\"I'm Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail\\", in which Cash flubs the last verse, and a second duet with June, their silly take on Ray Charles' I Got a Woman (in which June flubs a verse).  We're also given \\"June's Poem\\" which highlights what an entertainer she was in her own right.  The second set finds Cash a little more tired.  He trims his set to 16 tunes, looking to his entourage to fill out the hour.  Carl plays three tunes - this time adding The Old Spinning Wheel and Matchbox - as do the Statlers, including their big hit Flowers on the Wall.  Johnny adds Give My Love to Rose and I Got Stripes (both of which were included on the original album, but not the first set), and drops several ballads: Long Black Veil, Send a Picture, The Wall. The songs they messed up the first time around are cut, too. June gets another moment in the sun, though, this time with Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man - her growls and Carl's blistering leads are absolute gold.  Why it was left off the 1999 release, I can't imagine! (Check out their similar 1969 performance caught on film at Cummins Prison on YouTube.)  To round it out, they take two stabs at the new Greystone Chapel to ensure they have a version fit for the record, but it was the first set's take that was used in the end anyways.  The Box Set is just as it should be for completists: complete from start to finish.  Casual listeners will prefer one of the single-disc versions, though.<br /><br />For this and more reviews, as well as discussion of b-sides and outtakes, visit my blog: raisemyglasstothebside at wordpress dot com

B007CKHPD6|3.0|I got this free let's just end it at that. But besides the hour interview. The film face it. It's from 1972 and it was done with 16 mm cameras that's why you get the original little square format. They didn't want to bother or didn't have the multi tracks tapes to remix the soundtrack and re sync with the film. Maybe they just can't. As you know about any 16 mm film the soundtrack always is in mono and it's low fi. It's just not like the amazement of 16 track audio tape. That's what your watching but one thing thank God they made it. To really just have this period documented. To be bad it wasn't a full Fragile concert to watch Bill Bruford. But there's great TV video tape footage of that. But whatever its the best I ever seen it.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey in the space of 2 weeks.  Was obsessed after the 1st season and could not finish the rest of the seasons fast enough.  Wonderful story telling and characters that leap off of the screen.  I cried , I laughed, I grinned like an idiot, and wept openly when Sybil and Matthew died. I truly went through every emotion  possible in that 2 weeks.  Now January 5th, 2014 seems an eternity away.  I had heard great things about the series but had no idea it would take my mind and heart the way it did.  10 stars, if that was posible,  would be my rating.
B000BNI99K|5.0|As a huge fan of artists such as Frank Sinatra & Nat King Cole, I was a bit apprehensive re: Mr. Stewart's renditions of these classic songs in this 4 CD collection. But I am thrilled and amazed at what a TOP RATE job he's done with all of them. I guess I was used to growing up & listening to him in his &#34;Blondes Have More Fun&#34; era (which I really love too!) But he's truly taken on a whole new image-so to speak- and has brought these beautiful classics back to life in his own unique style for us to enjoy again.<br />Great job Rod! Keep these Cds coming!

B004X2M9VY|5.0|Season six really locked in Matt Smith as the doctor. Imaginative series season 6 managed to keep things fresh and come up with new plot twists.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This movie had some really amazing visual effects but the storyline fell way short of its ambitious destination of the great and powerful Oz.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the options better than some of the other weather apps. Also this app is very easy to use.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The story line  was great and gripping. The fact that it was filmed in the original castles in UK was delightful. I am still waiting for season 4 to come....can't wait long hence the 4 stars...else I would have given a 5.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I understand the concept of Shock and Awe.. and even perhaps &#34;changing the expected&#34; but to kill one of the major heros.. just ruined the entire film for me. Especially since i don't feel that DJohnson should have been the main lead (i like him as an actor, but GI JOE isn't about DJohnson.. IMO.)<br /><br />Great action, cute story.. great special affects, NOT what I expected.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I expected to like this book, so many people I know love it and have recommended that I read it.<br /><br />I was really put off by the idea of Ender committing genocide, killing off the other race just simply because it was thought that they &#34;might&#34; attack again. The fact that he expressed doubts about the morality of his actions before taking them do not excuse him. The fact that he did it while he thought he was playing a game do not excuse him (he was prepared to do it when he was in battle)<br /><br />and the idea that he could tell the &#34;story&#34; of those he eliminated, be their &#34;speaker&#34;, was vile to me<br /><br />yuck
B0039TAHMA|4.0|While FOTR had mostly minor inconsistencies TTT has major ones.<br />-Eomer was imprisoned by Wormtongue, not banished.<br />-Treebeard already knew Isengard was destroying the forest, the Entmoot was called to convince the other Ents to go to war against Saruman (Treebeard knew Merry and Pippin weren't orcs after he heard them speak, by the way).<br />-The women and children of Edoras are sent to Dunharrow, not to Helm's Deep with Theoden and the Rohirrim. There's also no stupid Warg/Orc/Rohirrim battle where Aragorn goes flying off a cliff into a river.<br /><br />There's a lot more (Google it), but it really throws you out of the movie if you've read the books. Jackson changed things around, then had to change more to cover his tracks. He makes quite a mess, but as usual the battles and locations are very visually striking and nearly make up for his mistakes.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|EXCELLENT timer app!  Tried a few others and this is by far the best.  The ability to have all the timers I'll ever need preset and ready to use is what makes this app great.  Works perfectly on my Note 2 when other timer apps didn't.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I have recently bought this movie and saw it, I have to say that I tremendously enjoyed it. It was wonderfully done. William Holden is wonderful in his role. Also you get to see actors that Gloria Swanson knew in her heydays during the silent era, people like Buster Keaton, Cecil B. De Mille who calls her by the affectionate nickame that he had for her (Little Felllow) that he used to call her when she began to work for him. You have also Hedda Hopper before she became a journalist. You have other old actor of the silent era doing cameo's in the movie, nice to see them. The gentleman that plays her butler (Erich Von Stronberg) directed her (Gloria Swanson)in some movies during her silent movie career.<br /><br />I had also read recently that the silent movie actress Mae Murray sued the production company because she thought the role of Norma Desmond had been based on her.<br /><br />Her character (Gloria Swanson) in the movie mentions 4 or 5 times a man with whom she did a movie and with whom she was friend's in real life, I am talking about Rudolph Valentino.<br /><br />All in all this is a wonderful movie for people who were wondering what had happened to the old stars of the silent era. Some came out of this era in wonderful shape and able to continue working in the movies when the talking era began and others saw their career destroyed when the talkies started.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|read the whole book in less than 7 hours. Couldn't stop, as a 14-year old boy, I felt like I was gonna start crying at any second. I'm sitting in bed. Just thinking now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finally read Fifty Shades trilogy because I kept reading the reviews on the book and I was hooked right away. The book can get very graphic and to be honest sometimes I scanned forward on those parts. Has a great love story. Addicting!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The last YouTube app I got was horrible, it crashed all the time! This one is much much better than  the last.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|very nice sci-fi movie- not mind blowing but it has great twists and a wonderful look and some powerful scenes.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|it was good..not great..just wish the ending was the intro to the OZ.we know..end the movie the the house landing on one of the witches.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I've always loved Roaring Twenties era gangster movies, this show ivd up to my expectations!  Love this show and everything about it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle but wanted to replace it with my Android tablet.  This application is essentially the same as Kindle for PC.  It allows the storage and management of numerous books.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|It was an okay story.  You follow along with Nikki Heat and you know what she knows. Then at the end, the writer excludes you from a interrogation that Nikki has, so you cannot figure out who done it by yourself.  I will not be checking out the other books.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|If you like the humor of Princess Bride you'll like this movie. The villain is fun to watch. Great special effects.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This show is fantastic. I recommend it to everyone. It is bloody (obviously) so extremely squeamish people may be bothered, but it is well acted, of fantastic production quality, and a general bang up good show.<br />I liken it to A Game of Thrones, but historical rather than fantastical.<br />Absolutely worth the buy, no question.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this is an addicting Game.  don't know how I feel about the glue credits yet.  might end up being expensive in the long run
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Just when you think you have it figured out, a twist come along. I do like the introduction of the old gunny.
0399159347|4.0|The book starts a bit slow and it can be a bit confusing in the beginning- the constant switching of characters- but once you get the gist of the story, it's hard to put down! It was interesting to see how all their lives connected, but what I truly loved about the book was the Epilogue in the end. It is so touching and makes you realize that your life could have gone so many different ways and that a split second can change it's course. Be sure to read the Epilogue at the end! Overall, this is a great read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever! My favorite You tuber plays it. My favorite thing to do is build shelter and run away and kill the zombies! I'm also great at survival! Creative us great to! In anyway, minecraft is just awesome!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great stuff. How long can Mike keep his secret from everyone? There's some real nifty cliff hangers in this season. Makes a person wonder about morals, ethics, scruples, and remorse. With all of that in mind we're rooting for the money grubbing lawyers. That's some good writing and good acting to suck us in like that.
0399536108|5.0|This book was perfect for me at this point in my life. I'm 21, deciding what I want to do with my life, and this book really inspired me to dream big and take action. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs some sort of confidence with their goals.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The Script is excellent as well as acting.  I always wanted to watch two in a row!!  I am just as wrapped up in the lower floor employees as well as upper class.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this is one of the most fun and interactive games I have gotten plenty of puzzles always changing...get it you wont be sorry.Still working on it after weeks of play gets harder but it keeps your interest...
B004UID2LC|4.0|I personally love this app but it's got around things to fix. I get to the home screen and click search and it stops. Really annoying but I still love the app
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game, but ever since the update it freeze! Please fix this problem!!! Finally, made it to elite stages. Needing to upgrade my weapons!
B004811PMO|1.0|Delightful!  Have not seen it in a long time.  It is a classic and makes me remember my senior operetta in high school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining, as well as clever and amusing.  Holds your attention with lots of challenges.  I definately recommend.  Try it
B004IK30S2|5.0|I can't wait for the sequel. You Have to watch it multiple times to really enjoy huge cast of characters. .
B0064MGU98|5.0|it was great!!! never thought a show about lawyers could be so interesting.  Scandal and family issues.  It looks at capital punishment and all.  It was very good indeed!!!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|it will not let me download this app and I really want this app my friends are telling me to get it but I cant, I cant wait till I get my phone.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Great straight forward interface. Good set of puzzle sizes allowing various levels of challenge. Only feature I think would be nice would be some automatic pencil marking tools.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I noticed the writing seems to have a flow and then other voices emerge truncating the narrative. The film is still interesting, but all over the place at times. It dares to tackle some lofty subject matter in the realm of education, but often feels done in by the direction which upstages the actors and story. In an interview with Collider Bryan Cranston defended the writer Carl Lund by saying Tony Kaye didn't honor the script. Maybe that accounts for the helter skelter feeling to the film. It's not a great film, yet it still manages to be relevant.
0307476073|4.0|I bought this book because I enjoy nonfiction adventure stories.  I loved Glass Castles and Half Broke Horses.  I've read every book on Everest, the seven summits and how to survive in the wilderness. This is not that kind of book.<br />With that said, I think a lot of the reviews that are  negative are judging the author and her behavior. She discusses sex, drugs, and her struggle to accept her mother's death.  If you are conservative this is not the book for you. If you are able to read a book and learn something, it's a wonderful story about struggling and starting anew. It didn't move me like To Kill A Mocking Bird does, but it is worthwhile.  Keep in mind she is blunt about every aspect of her life. I find that to be an honorable quality.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Just what I expected, nothing more and nothing less. A good movie about zombies and it had a nice ending.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app will not let you save photos to your gallery.  It will only let you upload them to Facebook. Fix this and it would be a good app. As it is, it is a one star app.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Addicted to this series. No problems with any of the DVDs. Brillant acting and directing. Good luck trying to watch just one episode at a time :)
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I loved every page of  this book  as well as of his first book and I deeply appreciated James' &#34;heartful exposion'<br />of himself .<br />I wish fm my heart an enjoying life to both James and his Bob.<br /><br />Daphne<br />Athens,Greece
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Such a brilliant series. We have all seasons purchased separately, no issues with the DVDs. Eagerly anticipating the final season.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is fun!  Very addicting as others have mentioned.  Keeps you on your toes as your eyes scan the options for matches.  Very appealing colors and sounds.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Addicted to this series. No problems with any of the DVDs. Brillant acting and directing. Good luck trying to watch just one episode at a time :)
B004EAQNO4|4.0|I had heard negative comments about this movie based solely on it being an M Night movie but honestly, it was good. It isn't going to win any Oscars, but it wasn't meant to. This is a tight little movie with good acting and an interesting concept. I enjoyed it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Addicted to this series. No problems with any of the DVDs. Brillant acting and directing. Good luck trying to watch just one episode at a time :) Husband and I have all of them (purchased season by season) and have stayed up way too late watching this, but you just can't stop.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|Not much to say. plenty of settings for beginners up to expert. graphics are clean and simple. i like it.
8866135763|5.0|This is the best pocket planner ever! I've been using this planner for almost 5 years. The thing I like in the &#34;monthly&#34; planner is that you can always know how many things you have to do during the hole week and the hole month, all writen in the same page. And if you need to write something else... There are 2 notebook pages between each month and many more at the end of the planner.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read this for my book club but otherwise would not have taken the time to finish. It was very disappointing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|One of the best stories I've ever read, and as a 4 pack bundle, how could you not want to buy this?!
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|I'm sure this is a great game. Sadly it crashes 95% of the time at the start screen. Once I did get in it needed to be calibrated as my phone was not flat when tilting it around to get the ball to move. I hit the pause button hopping to find a option menu only to have it crash again.<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S3
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Decided on this for my big summer read due in part to the brief bit on the book portrayed in the movie Lincoln.  Glad to say there was so much more and I was surprised by how gripped I became in the content.  Lincoln was an intelligent, kind, and truly great man.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book did not live up to the hype.  It was initially suspenseful, then just pathological.  An ok beach book but I would not run to buy this.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Quite a bargain for such tiny little things and they perform just like the factory equipment that came with my Bluetooth.  The initial purchasing of this product was smooth as silk without any glitches. I am a &#34;happy customer and a happy listener&#34; with the Voyager Pro-3 Pack products from this seller. The quality of this item was better than expected, too. I have not noticed any difference between the replacement 3-pack and the original factory equipment provided with the Bluetooth.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and think you will be as happy with this product as I am after using it.  The shipping was blazing fast and as usual, Amazon cannot be beat for their great prices!
B001IMR7EQ|5.0|If you have seen this movie as often as I have, it is awesome to have the soundtrack as it takes you back to the scene with each song.  I had a blast listening to it and sharing it with my daughter.  She loved that I knew all the words and could do the timewarp.  Love it!!!
1452126577|5.0|my friend told me about Grumpy Cat.  I had not discovered Grumpy Cat, but when I decided to send a gift her way, I wanted to find a book for her and this was the book of choice.  My nurse friend called and was laughing during our conversation, telling me about the funny pictures and how her daughters would be thrilled with this book, too.  it was a hit as a gift and I wish there were more books like this to send as gifts.<br /><br />Based on my friend's reaction to this book, I highly recommend it for anyone wanting/needing a smile and a great gift for a friend, relative or self...especially if you want some smiles.  The shipping was fast, the item arrive in perfect condition and I am so pleased with another &#34;Amazon winner&#34; in my opinion.  My friend is really enjoying this book and I think you will, too.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|A very disturbing and poetic read. A peek into the vanity of people and it's possible results. I couldn't put it down even though I dreaded reading it.
0143038583|4.0|This Book makes you think. On what we eat now and if its any good or if its really food at all and how much corn we take in.Very good read and can be hard.
B002MFV2IK|2.0|Found this boring and silly.  Like Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep but this didn't get me to rate it higher
B000W9399S|4.0|Now that I have read the whole book I intend to reread the begining (if not the whole thing). Once I learned the cadence of Pratchetts writing it was quick witted, imaginative and funny.  'Alice in Wonderland' meets 'Lord of the Rings'.  I would like to see and artists rendition of Disk world, very colorful!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|It started well, got a bit slow and depressing, but the last hour was very entertaining. Worth seeing I think.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minion rush is the best version of temple run that there is.I personally like survivalcraft and hungry shark evolution as favorite apps though
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin spacey is amazing as usual. Good story good characters.  We don't watch a lot of television shows bit this one is worth it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this game because I like all the Mahjong games. The game is challenging but is a worth while game to play
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is amazing. Don't hesitate to start reading it and taking into account it's free for kindle version don't miss it
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it. I could put more than 3 lenses in there and it's perfect for an on the go film maker like me!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Harvey and Mike are awesome! I enjoy watching Suits very much because Harvey and Mike are clever. I also find the process of them trying to resolve each case is interesting.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Completely immersing, while thought provoking,even inspiring, this  book  makes me wonder about my own personal legend.  I hope its not too late to pursue it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My precept:  We all bring our own special powers into the world, so great it is that we are all unique.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Enjoyed the acting and the story-line: Talented loner goes to college who learns some social and leadership lessons that she did not anticipate.  Both she and her friends learn some surprising things about themselves growing up that first semester at college, and it did not come from a book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The build up and initial story line was quite good. The aftermath of the final battle seemed haphazard. The time thereafter was an anemic ending.
B006LXQID8|5.0|After watching a movie like Amelie, I often feel uplifted and saddened at the same time. I love everything about this movie, especially acting and the narration. Seeing places I've been to in the movie was also exhilarating.
B004132HZS|5.0|First off, I would like to say that I only recently became a fan of Sherlock Holmes due to a surprise visit to London during which I visited the Sherlock Holmes Museum out of pure curiosity. When I went home that evening the first thing i did was look up all the Sherlock books on my Kindle and sat down the entire night and read them one by one. Since then i have watched all the movies and series and I can honestly say this one is my favorite so far. Compared to the 1980's version and the American adaption (elementary) this one definitely hits the mark.<br />Set in modern day London and infused with the artistic genius of Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat and the always untouchable acting skills of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman this show will get you 'Sher-locked' in no time. Enjoy!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie!  It has it all:  drama, laughs, pace, tongue-in-cheek, and great acting.  Curl up and enjoy a fun time!
B005H1SDQU|5.0|I have been a fan of Steve Hackett since he left Genesis. I have most of his work and my favorites include his classical guitar work. But I also love the rock on Spectral Mornings and the blues on faces. This album has it all, and it seems to be tied together like a theme. Another reviewer said to listen all the way through several times. I finally did and it was on the third time that it came together. A place called freedom is one of my favorites, but I cant say there's a bad number on the whole CD. This is an amazing piece of music that cover several genres. Add to that the fact that he is one of the best guitarists of our time and you have a sure bet.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Cable is long enough to charge and still be able to use my Kindle.  Great addition to the PowerFast Charger.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|But I am a Sci-fi junkie.<br /><br />I really felt that this movie had a great mix of emotion and action. Well done!<br /><br />Now for the bad news.... The Blu-ray will not play in my Sony BDP-CX960 or my Sony PS3, both with their latest firmware. After the menus it just goes black. Anyone have any ideas or updates on this issue, sounds like many are having this trouble.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was very entertaining, I enjoyed every bit of it. Not only are the minions adorable, they are also very funny. My girlfriend and I would not stop laughing throughout the movie. The Villain is very funny as well, I love his accent. Overall great movie.
B0041D843M|5.0|Just finished reading the China Study.  Extremely eye opening and educational. A must read. I challenge everyone to try a Whole Food Plant Based diet for 1 month. Reap the benefits!  Become empowered!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I cant post to facebook like its supposed to, and I cant access my photos from facebook. so that's is really annoying.
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|The Vigil is the new band of Chick Corea, but in the cover of the CD, Corea himself say \\"We have been doing it for a long time, just gave it a new name(for now), \\"The Vigil\\". In fact there is nothing new but you can find in the same album difference approach to the same music. The two first pieces; Galaxy 32 Star 4 and Planet Chia are part of the last period of CBS albums of Return to forever. \\"Portals to forever\\" is more jazz in classical style. \\"Royalty\\" is more \\"Captain Marvel\\", the first period of Corea band. \\"Outside of Space\\" is a typical soft ballad with his wife Gayle Moran . \\"Pledge for Peace\\" is probably the best part of the album. In this live recording play Ravi Coltrane and Stanley Clarke, 18 minutes of pure music, fantastic. The last one is \\"Legacy\\" a homenage to legacy of the greatest composer of jazz.<br /><br />Conclusion; a great album with different Coreas, and the beginning of a new adventure. Tim Garland on sax, Charles Altura on electric and acoustic guitar , Hadrien Feraud on bass, Marcus Gilmore on drums are The Vigil. After years you can find a \\"new\\" record in the same spirit of Return to Forever. If you like RTF don't miss this experience
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|I found this APP for free and gave it some thought before down loading. As you can tell I did, and I won't go into detail telling about this game because someone has already done that. Yet I will say that this game is fun for how simple as it is. Don't let it fool you, it may look easy, but you have to be steady at playing it. Yes it can frustrate you and you're on the verge of deleting it when it calls you back to try it again. Soon that one more time leads you into playing more levels, and the same thing happens all over again. Guess what you do? That's right you're right back at it playing it. It's a no brained game, but you're going to love it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Wonderful that this is free to watch under amazon prime. It is a good movie and fun to watch. Looking forward to the next movie, Thor 2.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|Up until one third I enjoyed it very much, but half way through I found it more and more difficult. I am not proud to say this but to be honest my knowledge on the area is very shallow. history, civilization, international relationship. However, even as an asian I found the book very detailed, fact oriented and objective. I wish I had more knowledge on the area to enjoy it more. I am trying to read some books on china to understand them more, I might want to start with easier book on the subject. One of the greatest book if you have some base knowledge.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|But could a better.  I am not sure that CZJ (Catherine Zeta Jones) pulls off the lesbian role all that well but she is sufficiently evil to pull off this role.  Good movie but I can't say great; I almost works but some of the actors are a bit stiff.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game.  I like the different modes for searching for the items in the GAME. I also like that you can buy items or wait for your energy to recharge. Great game!!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Dune was a long time favorite of mine. but the more I read Game of Thrones, the more I fall in with the story. I you liked the 3 first installments, you will love Feast of Crows.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was very emotional, but it is one of those books you cannot put down. I think I almost cried several times while reading this book, which I almost never do. This book may be difficult for some people to read, so be warned, once you start there is no going back.
B00D3V85FA|4.0|Although not ground breaking this has the classic Sabbath sound, the music and lyrics are solid. As a Black Sabbath fan its great to have more of their music, this album rocks.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love this game bc it's never ending, but it takes WAY TOO long to earn diamonds & things to access the different rooms.
B004QSQMKE|1.0|This is not what I expected, not the version i saw when I was yonger.  it is mushy and sappy and lots of unnecessary parts that were added.....dont get this and expect the version you saw on TV or the original version
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Totally addictive!! This game is a lot of fun &amp; a super time waster! I have it on all my devices, so I won't run out of things to do while I wait.
B00846REIS|3.0|This came highly recommended to me from 2 different friends, but I just wasn't that impressed. It had it's good parts, but overall, I found it boring and I had a hard time finishing it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very touching story that I could not put down. Highly recommend it.  I think this will remain a favorite for many years.
B000002L7Y|5.0|All of the songs are so heartfelt and deep. I could play it over and over again because there isn't a bad song on the CD other than Take On Me which has just been so played out over the years.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|You can't save your work, even though the app \\"looks\\" like it's saving it. You can't choose where to save it. You have no idea where (or IF) it's being saved.<br /><br />Without the ability to save your work, this app is no better than a toy - a toy that's not worth downloading even as the free app of the day. Don't waste your time.
B000005S5N|5.0|Not a bad song on the CD. And Morten Hacket's voice sounds like an angel.  All of the songs are so heartfelt and deep. I could play it over and over again.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|If you love logic puzzles, you'll love this.  Great variety, fast paced, and excellent graphics.  Best puzzle game I have found so far.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The rating I chose called attention to the high definition captured in the detail of the Enterprise, the Galeo as well as the pilot and assistant which had never been before attained in the earlier version.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I love this movie and there is really not much more that I can say besides that right there that I said.
0596009208|2.0|If this is your first programming book, or if you come from a non object oriented programming background this book may be a good choice. For the expert C++ developer, all the little cartoons and drawings were a great distraction that wasted far too much time. If this is your first progamming book, then it may deserve five stars.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is definitely a great family movie. It has lots of humor for both adults and children to enjoy. :)
B004UPANAI|5.0|I think the X-Men movies have some ground to make up and I think this was a good step in the right direction. Looking forward to the next one.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie. It may be weird bc I'm not a kid but I really enjoyed it and kinda want to see part two. I bought this recently for my little cousin, he loves it and watched it like three times in one day! His older siblings hate me now lol
B005NFWCSK|5.0|I hope the future X-men movies follow suit. This one was at least one of the best in the series so far.
0553381407|3.0|As with most self-help books, you have to pick and choose the parts that are important chapters.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have been using it to make grocery lists and quick notes for over a year and I love it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn writes another exciting adventure that keeps you turning pages.  Enough twists and intrigue to enjoy Rapp and his team through another crisis.  Too bad it will be the last.
B001CTDH4Y|3.0|My daycare kids like this. I thought this was a pridictable story line, but cute, and you couldn't beat the story

B000DWMYQ8|3.0|My day care through age 11 were not interested. Turned it off for something else. Better as family with older kids.
B000002LJW|5.0|If You like Eric Clapton and this CD isn't in Your collection, shame on You. Every track is awesome and whats cool is it starts out with a great song and ends with the best version of Before You Acuse Me, that I've ever heard (sorry B.B.) So sit back and enjoy!!!

0316228583|3.0|THE CASUAL VACANCY is a beautifully written book.  It's a pleasure to read a book that uses the English language in such a wonderful way.  Unfortunately, by the time I reached page 150 I was fed up with all the backbiting, dislike/hatred and temper tantrums of husbands toward wives and wives towawrd husbands, parents toward their own children, neighbors toward neighbors and so-called friends toward friends.  I know what Rowling was trying to do but it was deeply disappointing and disgusting to waste such beautiful writing on such a negative book.
B005PK1G76|5.0|While this product is marketed for use with infant strollers, I use it with my golf push cart.  I found the beverage holder for my Bagboy push cart to have major design problems and was searching for a better alternative.  The Buggy Buddy fits the bill perfectly.<br />It is very sturdy, straps in below the cart handle bar and has room to securely hold two beverages.  I use two stainless steel vacuum insulated beverage holders.  The buddy keeps them in a convenient location, stretches to easily and securely hold them and fits below the handles.  The buddy also has a large compartment that makes for easy access to small accessories that I want to get to quickly.  There is a zippered compartment, though I don't really use it.<br />It's funny, that with the number of engineers working on golf accessories, there really aren't any that do what Diono's fine product does.<br />I would have appreciated this when my daughter was an infant, but am happy to have found this for my push cart.<br />Diono, I'd like to suggest you start a line of golf products.  You can just repackage this product for golfers who use a push cart with a wide handle.
0062080237|2.0|This was the first Neil Gaiman novel I read and it will probably be the last, not counting \\"The Sandman\\" which I have nearly finished.<br /><br />What are the problems with this novel?<br /><br />Well, for starters, the protagonist (Shadow) isn't really proactive. He just sort of glides along and reacts to situations. We aren't given any particular reason to care about him aside from his recent difficulties related to his wife. He doesn't seem to care much about anything really and the reader isn't given much reason to emphasize with him nor care what happens to him.<br /><br />The second glaring problem is that the story isn't particularly interesting. Sure, I get that the new gods represent capitalism, technology and that sort of thing compared to the old gods whom they are going to war with for no particular reason. The new gods are apparently ambitious and have some sort of goal, which I'm not sure what it is, because the book never describes how they relate to humanity as opposed to the old gods. It would have been nice to know how these entities are \\"gods\\" when we're not told how they are worshiped or given reverence to.<br /><br />And the third big flaw is that you feel you're reading something by a Clive Barker imitator instead of an author with his own vision. The plot, the characters and the prose owe a lot to Barker and the reader would probably not notice the difference if a clever prankster put Barker's name in the place of Gaiman ... they would just think they were reading one of Barker's lesser works.<br /><br />My final thought is that if you never read this book, you're not missing much. Read Clive Barker and you'll eventually come onto a similar but better story. I haven't read the rest of Gaiman's novels, but from the sound of it, they all go down the same trail that Barker has already gone down.
B0088W4YTK|3.0|Show starting to find reasonable plots hard to find, but I enjoy the actors and their characters therefore I found the series enjoyable.
B000P7V45S|5.0|GENESIS  HAD THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM AFTER THEIR SINGER DEPARTED. LIFE WITHOUT PETER WAS GOING TO BREAK THE BAND OR MAKE IT STRONGER.....

SPECIAL PRAISE MUST GO TO STEVE HACKETT WHO WAS NOTHING SHORT OF GREAT. THIS RECORDING HAS THE ENTIRE BAND PLAYING TOPS AND ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT TO LISTEN TO.

B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Show that has a sense of humor while addressing some issues that might be relevant if space travel via a stargate were possible.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|My favorite move of all time. DVD is in awesome quality and was worth every penny. I would really recommend.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This was the first book I have read  in a long time and I was amazed at how interesting it was for the most part. There was a spot during the last half of the book that was a little dull, however, I would still recommend giving this book a read.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|At least this book had a plot and it was not all about sex.  A better read than the first book in the series.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|These are fun &#34;puzzles&#34;!  I agree with everyone else.  They are challenging, but not frustratingly so.  Just disappointed that there weren't more!  Waiting patiently!!
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Got this as a gift and after watching the DVD and hearing the live shows, I've decided to buy a few more for other friends and family.  This was one of our faves years ago so this release is a great gift!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Easy to pick up, can drop in for a few minutes or hang out for a while to build and battle. I enjoy most elements of the game, but it is a free to play game so there is some push to get you to spend money. However, I've enjoyed the game and don't feel the need to spend money to advance.

B004LPLU4K|3.0|The three kids in this movie were good, but all the liberties taken with the original story were disappointing.  It was actually jarring to suddenly hear some lines lifted directly from the book when the story line wandered back to the book...Makes me want to get the 1940s version; maybe that first version stayed closer to the book?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love  this app it is  so much fun but I don't know why it won't let me update to 0.7.2 cause I did it on my iPod and I can't do it on my kindle fire other than that I love this app and if you love it I suggest getting launcher pro so you can change your skin and texture pack
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I enjoyed some plot lines more than others. My single favorite moment was the golden crown the man got who was willing sell his sister and have many men die so that he could rule. All men who think armies should fight to give him a throne should have a crown like his.<br /><br />I haven't watched the last DVD yet, but it is clearly a quality production.
B002VECM4K|4.0|This movie is sad, true, and inspiring all at the same time. I think it is a great eye opener for the world.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great character story set against a believable backdrop.  The population of characters was dense enough to be interesting, but not so that you needed a cast reference to keep track of who was who.  Puller's character was a good mix of muscle, head and heart and the storyline provided an interesting mix of victory and loss - the good guys don't always win the game without a scratch.  Good read, highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful having the Bible on my kindle. I find it is so much easier to find specific scripture and helps me keep track of my reading. Very easy to use and convenient. I definitely recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I couldn't find the software I was accustomed to using for reading e-books from the library.  Out of desperation, I tried the Kindle app on my new device.  It works. I am able to download e-books with ease, and see them on the screen in the way that pleases me. That is all I ask from an e-reader app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey gives me insites as to how life was lived in the past. The characters are lovable, and feel like a real family.

B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box is a fast paced crime story with an intriguing story line. I couldn't put it down. Good story!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had given up on Stephen King.  A friend requested this book for Christmas, she was a history major, and it was a shock because she has never read a Stephen King book.  So, I thought, I will get myself a copy too.<br /><br />This is probably the best Stephen King book I have read and made me realize again that he is an American author who deserves more credit than he gets.  This book was fascinating.  Jake (a.k.a. George) is a character you care about and you care about him from the beginning.  He is an ordinary man, an English teacher, and a man with a heart.  This book for me was not about time travel.  It was about love and how it transcends time.<br /><br />However, the idea of time travel has always fascinated me.  I like how King showed that small changes in the past can have small changes to the future but huge changes can really cause a huge change in the future.  Even bad events such as JFK's assassination, can have positive results after the event.  I loved the narrative for it kept me interested throughout.  However, there are some sections of the book that could have been condensed.  King sometimes can belabor some points and gloss over others but he lays a great foundation for a story that keeps you wanting more.  It was the first time reading a Stephen King book that I cried at the end.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like the concept of this app, love the Bible, but every time I turn on my Kindle Fire it tells me I have to force close the app because it is not working/connecting, whatever!  So if I have to keep turning it off, how can I use it?
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Works great and a good place to have songs in the deep blue Clouds so you will never loose them.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I think Anthony Ryan is a creative and brilliant writer. It was a book I read front front to end skipping nothing, as I find myself doing with many books out of boredom. Enjoying it immensely I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy. I look forward to the next book regardless that I was neither crazy about the ending nor now he arrived to his dismayed conviction that the second book will have to address. Still though,  a book this well written is simply exciting to read and deserves praise.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|As usual Lee Child again put together a read that was a &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of novel! Exciting from start to finish! Perhaps a little to graphic in the sexual encounters? Only for the strong of heart? A classic Lee Child!
B005TTEFRG|4.0|I liked the original (AS) better but it was pretty good. Picture quality, audio, and set design were pretty good and acting was OK.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife is a must watch show. It blends the legal plot lines with the personal plot lines so well.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Out of all the available office programs I chose this one to use most. It worked the best with all word files I created and had the best features. Until recently. I shut off my phone and when I turned it back on and tried to open any file I couldn't, it would just go back to a new untitled document. Before that it would suddenly close on me or go to a different app from a few presses of keys. I tolerated occasionally saving, a good thing to do anyway, but this is the last straw. To me it is a useless program. My loss, my disappointment. But there are others...<br /><br />Edit: 8/25/2013<br /><br />This is an update to my original review. So I found out in their recent update they had made it so that you can open files, but the menu to do so, instead of automatically popping open to give you the options after you hit file and then open, is set to show only the file types. By default you tap on the types and it just opens up another blank document. The reason is that now the menu of options needs to be swiped from left to right to appear for you. There is no visual indicator of this. I just by chance did it and found it. Not good design as it leaves you unaware and confused as I was. At least I can open files again, but occasionally I get the document recovery message and have to reopen the last file I was working on instead of it just displaying it. The last file is not lost, but does not load. It has not crashed recently, but I still keep saving anyway. I have increased my stars from 1 because of my discovery. Besides the having to pay for the fonts thing, at least this app can open rtf files unlike others which does allows me to edit Scrivener files.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|this book was weird and completely boring. This kid ends up on an island where he discovers peculiar children and is being chased by life sucking monsters. Then there are strange photo inserts of creepy looking children straight from some positively icky photo shop experience. The ending goes nowhere and I found the whole thing flat and tepid!
B008B11R2A|5.0|I love The xx and picked up their first LP at a show in Atlanta. I really enjoy both records. This one came promptly from the seller (even before it was scheduled to arrive) and was in perfect new condition. The record is excellent.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story transports you and shares a life experience of a multitude of characters, the perspective of an irish immigrant girl taken in by a sea captain and placed with his half African American daughter..into the Kitchen House (this is where slaves work for the Big House to prepare meals) Each character has a touching point of view and shares the discovery of what family truly means. I found the vernacular to be very interesting and felt like an eavesdropper listening in the kitchen as  Ms. Grissom amazed with her ability to get the dialect just right on the pages to make it authentic whilst she entertains and educates.
B0083Z3O8Y|1.0|It held no interest for me, it was an effort to read the 3 chapters that I did read and I enjoyed removing the book from the device.

B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is really great but you can't input some kinds of words or use the things in certain ways
0307454568|5.0|This book is EVERYTHING I expected and so much more! The descriptive language, the main characters, the turns and twists will leave you turning pages wee into the middle of the night! All 3 of the books are awesome! Must reads for sure!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Very good read, shows how bad things can be if there's an overbearing government. Great dialouge, great characters, and great setting

0060853972|5.0|One of the best books you will ever read!<br />It's really funny.<br />Crawley is my new favorite name.<br />Everyone should read this book at least once in their life.<br />I've read it over and over and it's still funny.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|The app worked for a while but then it stopped responding and I had to delete then download it again
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a real page turner! Way better than the movie! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a good thriller or sci-fi.
B001OKQ7BG|5.0|I think this is the best Elvis special ever.  I was there the night after this was filmed, and this movie brought back memories of that really great evening.  It was nice to see Evis a little nervous coming back to the concert arena after being in the movies.  This was Elvis in his prime.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|If you own the Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset this is a must have accessory.  It servers as a nice storage box for your headset but it also charges the headset while it's being stored.  Definitely a must have.

B003IWRE3I|4.0|This movie followed surprisingly closely to the book, which is somewhat good and somewhat bad. If you like the movie then I for sure recommend the book.
0375869026|4.0|I'm a senior adult who enjoys reading young adult books every now and then.  I heard good things about this book from another mother who is reading it with her 12 year old son.  If my children were younger, this is a book that I'd want to read with them too.  If the Lord blesses me with grandchildren, I will definitely want them to read this book someday.  Kindness and compassion can never be emphasized enough to our children.
B00CF0ETBE|3.0|This is a good summary of the careers of Crosby, Stills, and Nash, together and in various configurations.  Apparently, Neil Young and management decided against making major contribution to the 77 tracks here when the box was first assembled, so Young's presence is sporadic, appearing on a few tracks here and there with only two and a-half (a co-write with Stills) writing credits.  This actually works in the set's favor, as the trio configuration is the relatively stable and durable one, and it allows for good solo and duo tracks to be liberated from various Crosby, Nash, and Stills albums that are fairly mediocre.<br /><br />Plenty of reviews elsewhere discuss the merits of the box from its initial issue in 1991.  The 2013 reissue appears to be the very same item, however, as no additional remastering has been applied.  The original remastering from 1991 was done by Joe Gastwirt at Ocean View Digital, an engineer and facility that has used the Pacific Microsonics HDCD process for a variety of remastering projects including the reissue of Joni Mitchell's entire 1968-1980 Reprise/Asylum catalogue in 2000.  It seems strange that no sonic upgrade was made for this box.  It could be that the artists believed it was not necessary as the remastering done in 1990-1991 was adequate; it could also be that the record company just wanted to get this back on the market with minimal additional cost.<br /><br />Either way, that decision was a mistake; what sounded cleaner in 1991 sounds a bit muddy now.  Given how long it has been out of print, it certainly would have been worth the extra time and expenditure to do this right.  If you own the original box, there's no need to buy this one.  If you own any of the CSN albums proper redone by Gastwirt at Ocean View that appeared in the mid-1990s, then think twice about buying this box to fill out your collection as it won't sound as good as the discs you already have.  The box is not terrible, and it's not necessarily a mistake to purchase it, but consider these caveats please before shelling out the $40-50 for it.urchase it, but consider these caveats please before shelling out the $40-50 for it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is excellent. It is so much more than just erotica. It has great character development and a great story to tell. I really start to feel for the characters. My only regret is I did not buy the trilogy to start with. If you are considering buying Fifty Shades of Grey, do yourself a favor and buy the trilogy. One part of the story will not be enough!!!

B000SZK41M|4.0|When my nine year old told me he was surprised they didn't curse more in this movie I thought he had a hearing problem until I realized he was being sarcastic.  Granted, it's probably a little inappropriate for a kid his age but so was Predator and Terminator and Jaws and Poltergeist, etc.<br /><br />This movie belongs in every library.  It's classic 80's action at its best with some of the most memorable scenes and lines of all time and it never gets old no matter how many times you see it.  Who can forget the asian dude who tortures Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon checking to make sure no one sees him stealing a candy bar while he prepares to shoot it out with the police or &#34;Hans, booby, what am I a method actor?  Put away the gun.&#34;

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Frankly, I don't think there's been a really good Bond movie since Connery hung up his Walther PPK but this one isn't just good, it's great.  Craig's Bond is the antithesis of the pretty boys who've held the 007 designation since the aforementioned Scotsman did and it's a pleasure to watch him wreak havoc on the minions of evil. No spoilers here.  Suffice it to say that this is hands down, the best Bond movie ever.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Interesting story line that is a little hard to follow if you're not an avid comic fan with knowledge of the characters. Lots of action and some humor.
B003GX5CWY|4.0|I have taken it upon myself from their earliest years to expose my kids to the true gems of the cinema, from Die Hard to Commando to Total Recall and now Predator.  Whether it's Jessie the Body without time to bleed or Carl Weathers without his right arm, their characters are timeless as is the story: a young, insect like and incredibly vicious alien comes to earth to sew his wild oats buy turning as many humans inside out as he possibly can.  Enter Arnold and his elite squad of special forces operators, and Carl Weathers as their unscrupulous CIA agent/manipulator.  It all adds up to a heart warming tale of American ingenuity (vine ropes, tree trunk traps) and good old fashioned mutilation and slaughter. Bravo sir! Bravo!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Very good condition, with no scratches or problems with the case/packaging. The movie itself is phenomenal, with nice bonus features as well.<br /><br />A great by for any collector!

0061950726|5.0|I love the way this is written, intertwining the stories of a teenage foster child and a woman in her 9th decade of life! I wished I would have been there, going through the boxes of memories and hearing the stories. This book touched my soul. As much as we know about our ancestor's pasts, many many stories, I'm learning, are lost because of cultural bias, ill-literacy, or have just been lost and looked over, or maybe to painful to recount? Stories like these instill a sense of \\"Wow!, and humbleness, in me, and I pray I can make it through this life with such grace and humility.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|A great soundtrack that I've listened to over and over again, and I don't skip any of the tracks.  Just be careful not to listen to this just before going to bed -- your pulse will be too high and your mind racing, preventing you from falling asleep.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Can I go fangirl for a minute? Squee!! Whew, that felt good. Tangled was recommended to me by several bloggers and I am so glad I picked this up. Emma Chase delivered a deliciously funny, outrageous and smexy tale. I laughed and giggled aloud and even read bits to my husband. Drew Evans is a spoiled, entitled, smooth-talking, swoon-worthy rich boy who gets a beat down. The tale is told in first person from his POV and Chase did an excellent job of giving him voice. When he spoke to me it felt real and warm and even when I couldn't believe what came out of his mouth I adored him. He may need a lesson in love, but he isn't a bad guy either. Katherine Brooks is bright, and I loved the interaction between the two of them. Their banter was hilarious and I loved the whole angry to kissing moments. If you are looking for something fresh, funny and new I totally recommend this one! Originally published at Caffeinated Book Reviewer.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Great move and very funny.  The actors played their role with a lot of humor and I thought it was done very well.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I felt like this was predictable for Sparks from what I have seen in movies. Same place. New girl comes to town. Fall in love. Tragic backstory. This was actually the first book I've read of his, because I tend to like books more than movies but I didn't with this one.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found the story was less about the doctor and more about his lectures, books, etc.  I've read other encounters that are more exacting in their memory of the event, then what I read in this book.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|Just wasn't for me. I didn't think any part of it was funny. I was bored and wanted it to be over.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great acting. An evolving plot. Action. Scifi. Worth a watch. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed, I promise.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Unfortunately dying is something that not just older people have to deal with. And this book approaches the topic of &#34;the end&#34; with wit and charm. I would expect nothing less from John Green. His characters always make me smile and even laugh out loud. But they can also reach very personal levels with thoughts about not only death but life and what it is all about. Recommended for anyone.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, I laughed, cried, and shouted out in surpise. I love that the point of view is from a character with a mental illness. The book shines light on how it may be to live with an mental illness and how a family deals with it. You need to read this book!!!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|You know those books where you constantly want to slap the main character across the face because you know his/her decisions are stupid? Well, that's what I felt about this book a lot. I am also really over the love triangle thing...BUT I really loved parts of this book and when the next one in the series comes out I will be reading it right away. The writing is good and I always want to know what will happen next...even if it's something incredibly stupid.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read many of Gregory's books and love them. I love this time period. I was very excited for another addition to the cusions' war series. Read the book and watch the White Queen show.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I'm not the most reliable reviewer for this one I guess because I don't like crime stories all that much, but I heard lots of good things about this one. Just wasn't impressed. I think maybe parents would be able to connect a lot more though.
B00785P2QC|5.0|After downloading this app I became very addicted! It is a whole lot of fun watching your city grow daily.
B005KJJ4F8|2.0|The concept of a futuristic fairytale was very appealing to me and it had a lot of potential, but I really didn't connect to any of the characters. I felt some of it was cliché and other parts very predictable. It just didn't produce a lot of emotion from me.
B005HED11Y|5.0|These shows were made so long ago, but I feel it is something that should be on TV today. Sure the acting scene has changed quite a bit, but the plots are all so awesome!
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I really really loved this book. It sticks with me even though it's been a while since I've read it. The characters are lovable and I fell in love alongside the characters. And of course Paris isn't the worst setting choice. :)
B00007E7K0|3.0|It is a Canon but comes off a little cheap and lacks the string. I lost my original cap and this one will be even harder to maintain without the ability to attached a string.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|And by a voice, a mean I didn't feel like I was reading a story but rather a character. I heard everything from him, and even though an unreliable narrator a times, this made him the perfect tool for human emotion and heart. I love this book and I didn't even like the movie. Mental illness is a big deal and it's something we don't talk about enough and this book doesn't try to talk about it, it tries to show it to you. In a magical, funny way. Go Eagles!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Very useful, I put this on my kindle fire and I use it when I am on a road trip and want to see the prices and reviews on hotels in the cities I will be staying in.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I'd personally recommend this book to everyone. It has fascinating characters, settings, and human experiences that absolutely anyone can connect to in some way. The book skips around to different narrators and places but is all woven together fluently so I was never confused. It made me cry but it also made me smile.
B004N868DS|5.0|It's got two sides: one is meant for speed (it's a little rough) and the other is meant for accuracy (very smooth). I like the accuracy for playing games and the speed when not playing. With accuracy I feel like I have more control over the camera when I'm playing. I have to move my hand a lot for fast movements but the lift off effect is close to non existent. The laser on the mouse detects the surface on which is in and you can select how high you want the lift off before the laser stops tracking. I like it very low because I can reposition the mouse back to the center of the Mouse Pad with hardly any lift. The rough side provides speed, which I like for navigating between menus, buttons, scrolling, etc.. Very sturdy, I don't think it'll ever break as long as it's on a flat surface. I'm very happy with it.
B000OVLINI|3.0|This is an adventure unlike any other I have read before. I think it appealed to me as an avid reader. The language and style was very good too. It was a bit too long I think and ever so often monotonous. But a good overall read.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I couldn't believe the amount of extra content that was put into this second release. It just looks gorgeous in blue ray. It is in deed a brand new movie! It was well worth my money.
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't great but very entertaining. Good actors.  This is a movie night with popcorn .Good.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|That basically sums it up.  It's a good read but not a memorable book.  Read it on an airplane trip.
B00E9PXI3S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I liked the subversive twists and turns.  It kept you guessing as to whether the main characters were actually something they weren't.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not quite as compelling as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns but still a very engrossing story, written well.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|This is an easy read! I really liked the story line in this book, and of course you have to read the entire series to appreciate it even more. Maggie Stiefvater does a good job bringing you into the book and story. I like how it's not just from one persons perspective but from several of the charaters in the story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have played the first temple run on iPad, and the kindle version is just as good. This version is so Mutch better than the first. It has new obstacles and more powerful. This version also has daily challenges that make you want to play it everyday. The first thing I indexed about Temple Run 2 was the amazing graphics that are Mitch better than the original Temple Run. Definitely get this app trust me it is worth it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun for any age. Collect bananas avoid obstacles all at a fast pace. What could be more fun? More minions.<br />Amandahansbarger
B004GJYROG|5.0|It is a great movie for the family to set down and watch. I enjoy watching it with my grand kids. It ship fast and I would recommend it to everyone.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|This seemed like a good decision to back up all of my files and be able to access them from anywhere.  However, this app would not launch from our Kindle HD.  Screen went gray when I pressed the icon.  It isn't compatible without extra memory on my Blackberry 9810 phone either.  The I-phone can use  it with ease.
B0049VZ222|5.0|What can I say? It's The Walking Dead. We love it, love it, love it, love it, love it! Did I say, 'we love it'.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Attempting to raise every species of dragon is both fun and exciting.  My Grandson and I share special time together each evening before bedtime collecting coins.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another John grisham good book.  I enjoyed the drama of the court room and there are some good lawyers and justice.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The episodes though generally predictable and great fun to watch. The characters are all charming and funny and the nonstop movie references hilarious.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it<br />This is a great program.  Make couponing easy!  My ten year old can use the program....that is how easy it is!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book is very well written and sheds light on issues for not only the main character, but for most of the women in prison who live in poverty, have been either underemployed or unemployed, and many who struggle with drug addition.  I read the book in one day--could not put it down.  Highly recommended.
0470913029|5.0|This book is a must for everyone who eats food and gives a $#O) about health.  You don't need to wish to become Paleo to need to read this book.  You can read this book and improve your gluten free and crap free diet...  IT is an AMAZING resource.<br /><br />I am going to buy this book for a few of my friends.  For example, my friends wife is vegetarian and has dark circles around her eyes...  this is cause most likely by the lectins found in beans and other legumes...  It then explains the whole fiasco behind grains and mostly FLOUR!!!<br /><br />loved reading this and onward to better health.
B002CNK1MK|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out, but since I only owned the VCR tape, and our player is broken, I wanted my Granddaughter to see it, so I got it from you.  She loved it!!!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This was an intricately plotted, well written book.  The switch between the past and the present, the voice of the main character and the voice of the narrator is sometimes confusing, but the story is so compelling and the plot so incredibly tight that you don't really getting all till thelastpage.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|This season had a good story arc, a fair amount of suspense, and many good individual episodes along the way.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had to read Orphan Train for by book club.  I was afraid it would be depressing and I wasn't looking forward to reading it.  I loved it.  The characters were so well developed and the story was so well told that I hated when the book ended.  An important part of our history.  You may be surprised to learn that someone you know has ties to someone who was on an orphan train.
B00068TJM6|5.0|best watch ever. Slightly difficult interms of settings. i recommend it to those who loves watches similar to Breitling chronometre.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The dresses are beautiful, the house is grand, and the Dowager is just plain ... awesome.  This is not high brow TV.  It is a soap opera set in an estate.  But it is so much fun.  Enjoy this guilty pleasure.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book so much. It is so well written and developed that its hard to put down. I enjoyed learning about each main character and then watching how their stories wind together. I really felt their joy, disappointment, and struggles as if I were right there with them. When Cecelia read John-Paul's letter I could almost feel my own heart breaking for her. I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend. I can hardly wait to read another by this author!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|For me, this book offers three areas of appreciation.  First, I am interested in the lives and perspectives of the average (non-governmental) Afghani citizens, from the people in the villages to those in the cities.  We don't see this in the news we get from that country.  Second, the story lines all center around family, and promote the value and strength of  family ties.  And third, we have three different situations of people moving to a different country to make their lives.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini is adept at reaching across national boundaries and presenting people making their lives as best they can.  He shows that the hopes and goals of people are pretty much the same everywhere.  The reader is drawn into each story and follows as the characters face their challenges and choices of life, realizing that people all over the world are not really that different when you eliminate governmental and radical religious influences.<br /><br />In this book, the author is not quite so good at melding the different story lines.  He has a lot of characters, and I frankly got lost in the middle of the book.  However, each part of the book is very readable and has its own appeal.  I debated between 3 and 4 stars, for that reason.  My real score would probably be 3.5 stars, however, I gave 4 because there are some very redeeming features.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book was a good read! It was realky sad at times but I really enjoyed it! The ending was a love hate type, I wanted more but it was a good ending! We read this for our book club and I would recommend it again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is just a really awesome game in general but the Pc version is a really good game its a tad addicting but its just a blast in survival creative whatever mode your in its really fun and lots olfactory people love it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Good game keeps my mind off a hard days work and is just like the real bingo love playing any getting bingo chip every 24 hours wish it was real moneybut enjuy changeling things. Hope everyone who plays bingo has fun. Keeps u in goon with you Monterrey skills
1451627289|5.0|A great read! One of the best books by Stephen King that I have read. I've been a fan for many year and the novel is just another masterpiece from the master.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|This case is very good looking and does the job.  The only thing I haven't quite figured out is how to use the phone when making a personal call (phone to ear) without breaking the spine on the back cover.  I just feel that if I break the spine it will take away from the beauty of the case.  Other than that the case does the job and the stand works fine.
B009MYAQK4|2.0|The story is not really a 'story'. It reads more like bible verses on abstract (largely philosophical) concepts; and perhaps that was the intention, and I just didn't not realize it. I thought it would have a plot line, or characters even.  I would encourage you to read a few pages first before purchasing, as this book was nothing that I expected.
B0031QVW2U|5.0|I love the idea behind this but it's a bit awkward for women to wear.  I had a male friend of mine try it out and it works great!  I didn't want to give this item a bad review just because I didn't do proper research on this item.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do and if having a strap run across your breast is not going to be a bother I recommend this strap.  I bought the BlackRapid camera strap made for women which is cut a little differently and curves down lower between the breast and that is why I am not able to wear the brad at a higher position on my camera strap causing it to cross at an awkward area.  Still going to try and make it work, because I really like the extra support it provides.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and knew that I wanted to own it when it was released on DVD.  The original Wizard of Oz is my all time favorite movie and it was fun watching this movie to see how they paralleled the characters.  Well done!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It's easy to lose track of time when playing this game. Better then the first more upgrades even extra heroes to play.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I didn't read the book ahead of the movie and agree it's a bit difficult to follow.  It's still a really interesting weave of storytelling, and warrants a second look for continued dissection and reading.  I can see it becoming a cult classic.  Regardless of the complexity, the underlying concepts are still prevalent and enjoyable to link together.  It's also fun to Identify the actors disguised in the various characters.  Hugh Grant was most surprising!
B008K8U13K|3.0|The control on the left button is difficult to use.  Very touchy area for the direction of the character.  Somewhat entertaining.
B000000OTU|5.0|I lost my old cd so had to reorder one because I love it. This is a rockin album. I'm sure any Areosmith fan will already have this one.
B001NA6096|5.0|This is the first and most romantic (of course), but you don't have to see it first.  In fact, I think you should see Before Midnight before.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Wow, I'm mentioned this book to friends and most have never heard of this classic.  One of the best reads ever.  Can't believe it was written in the 1800.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small yet very affective. i bought this to throw in my camping bag but decided to check it out first. I sharpened several different sizes of kitchen knives from pearing to butcher. It did very well all things considered, but to get a nice edge on them i head to finish them off with my large ceramic sharpener and a steel. For what it is designed to do (a tool small enough to carry for a quick edge) it does extremely well.
B00EE3FTNM|3.0|Interesting start to the Miniseries. The main characters have been introduced and many questions and suspicions have been raised. Potential conflicts begin to be introduced and we are left wanting to learn more about what actually happened and how did this boy end up dead on the beach. I look forward to discovering answers in the coming weeks.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is my review about this song. It is a great song. I like the singing and the music a whole lot.
0920668372|5.0|There are books that evoke the most primal feelings and this is one of them. Seemingly an innocent children's bedtime book- it is really written for parents. This is a keepsake, a book to give new parents. Its profound message is universal and meaningful. I promptly bought ten more to give to my nearest and dearest, and I want to say, this has become my favorite bedtime book!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The critics were right - this is a funny, funny book.  Tina Fey is a very talented writer; I am looking forward to more from her.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|A fun way to pass time.  No real skills needed - just a quick finger.  Challenge your friends in the weekly tournaments.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great way to get caught up, or to review, the previous seasons of Downton.  The acting is excellent, the historical setting - early 20th century England - is fascinating, and the fashions are beautiful.  I have enjoyed every episode of the 3 seasons, and can't wait for the televised 4th!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Not surprising- -I'm a big Downton Abbey fan, so I was pleasantly surprised with this series.  Good story lines.  Just wish there were going to be more episodes.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game it's really fun. I play all the time and really enjoy the experience. Try it you'll like it too. So so so so so much wholesome fun.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I found this app and it has been very good for getting my email on my tablet.  I have the Kindle Fire HD.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Wow so good I can't stop playing I need more cards though just don't stop playing because you can beet it in a day
B007D2XSW0|1.0|All the nifty effects, corrections and frill gee-gaws in the world and if you can't save your work, this is *still* an overpriced crApp from hell... overpriced and it was the free app of the day.<br /><br />Downloaded it, took it for a spin and after a good bit of time tuning a pic, discovered the programers were sadistic a**-hats, leaving no way to save your work<br /><br />Deleted with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />esDot Development Studio added to the 'Do Not Buy' list.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|What a great movie! It has a great cast and the story is very gripping ! Just a very fun movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun little game. Love the pictures. Not so fond of the music, but that is easy to switch off. This game is my rest and relaxation.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|This is the best movie out there! The story is just heart-wrenching and it's based on a true story. It is just well produced and the cast is wonderful!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was great. That's all I have to say but the word limit makes me say stuff like this
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's Perfect.<br />I Love Rick Riordan. Can't wait for the next book! I recommended this to all types of people.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Always keeps me updated with weather, use it mostly for when I go out of the country. Will continue to use this app.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|It's poop don't download it trust me it really sucks it lags and never shows the video just says the words
B004SVM7BW|1.0|As soon as I installed it I started having problems.  battery wouldn't charge.  phone seemed frozen.  it made me uninstall adobe.<br />I finally have my phone back to some what normal after a week if fighting it and 2 trips to the Verizon store countless consults with others who didn't know what to do.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was an amazing book!!!! Anyone who loves to read should grab this book and cuddle up and start reading right away
B000FCK65W|5.0|I have been wanting to read his book for years, but always avoided it because of its length. I only wish I had read it much earlier. It is going to be a book I will read many times. There are parts in this book that have stuck with me, and that is pretty profound.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|99 cents is worth it I love how I wake up in the morning on time and not be late for events
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I don't love it as much as the basic Google browser. It may work for others, but it doesn't do much for me.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|When you feel depressed, this book will surely uplift your sprit.  I have a cat and I can identify with most of the poems.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I didn't really care for it and deleted it shortly after downloading it. It wasn't very quick, and I couldn't watch every video I tried viewing.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Well plotted but drags a bit in the court scenes.  Not his best but still with twists and surprises one expects from Connelly.
B00005JKZV|5.0|What else is there to say?  You know what this movie is.  You know how awesome it is.  BUY IT ALREADY
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have played lots of solitaire games and really enjoy this one!  Recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire but doesn't want to be frustrated with it.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|Watched once.  Lame plot, lame actors, typical chick flick.  Dumb high school drama stuff that we all wish we could forget about and avoid revisiting daily on Facebook.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I love this show.  It was unfortunate that it had such a short run time on TV. It gives a very good message!!
0143120530|5.0|Disclosure: I'm only 50% through the book.<br /><br />As a physics teacher who's married to his work I've always had a tough time wooing the ladies and going out on a night with my colleagues without finding myself embarrassing both those around me and myself by my lack of social finesse and personal hygiene issues. So, when I was invited out with some of my work colleagues to a disco club this Friday, I very happily agreed but knew I had to prepare.<br /><br />After a quick Amazon search for a book that could help me amaze my new and potential friends with my dance skills (the moonwalk is the greatest of all dance moves) I found a book created just for me - a physics teacher whose only foray into dancing was a chicken dance competition at the age of 8 during a church picnic. The book \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\" had me hoping for a set of quick, learn-able, techniques that would finally make us physicists the life of the party both on and off the dance floor, but it seems like the first half is more about the story of a young man trying to remember playing cards and random digits than it is a treatise on the MJ-made-famous art of anti-gravity.<br /><br />Maybe I'm missing something and the secret to moonwalking is how quickly you can memorize playing cards or random digits, but after trying some of the techniques listed in this book I haven't yet seen my moonwalk improving.
B000063DS1|5.0|So pleased with this purchase. So much of the spirit of that night is lost if one only experiences the movie or the 2 cd release. Get the 4 CD release!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|My wife and I rented this as we liked the previews for the upcoming sequel, Red 2.  We both found it entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|My phone is Lg Optimus G with quad core CPU and 2Gb RAM but playing the game is very slow and lag. It is unbelievable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, challenging. Need new levels .  Really addictive though.<br />Levels are progressively harder. Keeps your mind working. Would  give 5 stars if more levels.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book really makes you think about what is important in life!  Loving others and doing a job you love to do that makes you happy!  NOT just chasing money!
B00005Q45W|5.0|If you are a Cohen fan, then you must have this album too. I recommend it. Nice songs as usual.
B00C061I3K|5.0|8/14 1 PM<br />Sorry but this review isn't about the music... I heard some on KCRW and had to order it.<br /><br />I don't know what the problem is but the AutoRip is not working.  10 minutes on the phone have not helped.<br />I guess I am going to Itunes???<br /><br />8/14 later<br />My earlier review was based on an AutoRip Problem which Amazon 'fessed up to after 20 minutes (ouch) on the phone. I have ordered 20 CDs from them (I get the physical CDS) with AutoRip, this one didn't AutoRip, and it took a while to resolve.  They credited me 11.99 to order the MP3's. This took care of my problem and they acknowledged it was on their end.<br />Short term my problem is solved, long term they need to prevent this from happening EVER.  WE NEED OUR MUSIC NOW sometimes :)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really like the game a lot but have had several times its froze up and didn't get my prizes for Bingo. But they have usually sent me my things after I sent in a report. Not bad for a free game.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Nice case love it ... I ordered this case for my Kindle fire HD and really happy with the quality and color :)
B00CGPPMKU|2.0|not much to work with. It's cool for a minute. Not much but a good babysitter app. great for kids.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies especially since they reference The Breakfast Club which is one of my top 5 all-time favorite movies! This movie is fun without being too silly or too much romance. I recommend this movie to anyone who is wanting a few good laughs and likes music.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I thought it well done and I like stories about real events and people. I felt that the young man's family had input on the film.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Is about vicarious projection, inserting yourself into the story and assuming the identity of the characters. I must say,George, you make that rather difficult by killing characters I've come to genuinely like with shuddering frequency.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Great game couldn't put it down. Had to get a little further. Wish it had a few more challenges b4 you get all the weapons.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I grew up watching MacGyver, and watching it over again is just as entertaining as the first time I watched it.  Awesome!
1907428429|5.0|Has lot of choices to make for children's birthdays.  Have fun choosing and making with your child!  I got it to give as a gift.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|Was quite hesitant to load this app. Especially after reading so many less than positive comments. However,I took a chance, and found the app., to be quite pleasant, easy to navigate, and very user friendly!  ONLY  issue I have found, is after preparing image for transport to Facebook,  everything cycles, but then no confirmation as to task complete, nor does it send it.  Was able to send image to Facebook, but only after saving to device, then send e-mail to my live account, then picked up image retrieval through Facebook. Other than this, it is an awesome app. App.performs well on my Kindle Fire  8.9&quot; H.D.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging...but not enough levels<br />Once you start getting into the game it's almost over. Need more than ten levels in any type of game
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game!!!!!!!!!!! I even have it on the computer it's even more awesome I really think you guys should get it. I love MINECRAFT.
1582701709|5.0|I believe is the perfect the gift !!! I bought this book for a second time ....good book for positive minds!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addictive and amazing. So much fun to play. Everyone that likes horses should play this game. Get it now! Never had so much fun playing an app before!
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book. A great mystery. I was very pleasantly surprised because of the traditional style Stephen King writes in. I love his horror books and this was very different, but still as captivating.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I read this with my 10 year old son. Just the right number of twists and turns to make it exciting, but not so many to make it too complex. Great intro to Grisham for him. We'll read the rest of Theo Boone series.
0064471837|5.0|These books are my absolute favourite books of all time. Sabriel is an inspirational character who has courage in the face of extreme danger and uncertainty. The world is richly imagined and the magical elements are fascinating and original.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great graphics, intriguing story line, fun to play.  I would definitely recommend this and am looking forward to the next version.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Tasks run in real time, but have been able to pay without buying gems, so far. So far, so good.
0307596885|5.0|Alice Munro's short stories contain vivid characters gleened from her life growing up in a small town in Canada during WWII. The stories are partly fictional, partly autobiographical but the characters are so three dimensional and fully-formed that you can easily put faces on them from your own past.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved it from start to finish. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway were very great. Russell Crowe is a great actor but came up a little short on the singing.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|As an American I have never truly understood the game of cricket.  As an American man I have had a hard time with understanding women and love. Hence the fact that I have been divorced twice.  I did enjoy this book however.  This love story is like no other and I truly enjoyed reading it.  I like reading love stories now because I am truly happily married(yes a 3rd marriage) and it is fun to read love stories and picture my wife and I as the couple.  Great job with this story.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have used the weather channel for years now. At home, at work and now on my phone and Kindle Fire. I have always been pleased with it and they continue to exceed my expectations.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|When I first heard about this book from a friend of mine I was skeptical.  Great, another zombie apocalypse story.  Frankly I was getting tired of all the living dead stuff on TV and in the movies.  However, after I started reading this book I could tell this was not your typical zombie story.  Yes there is dead walking and running around but the characters D.C. Rogers created in this story jumped off the page like a zombie jumping on a human.  This book shoots other zombie stories right in the head.
B008JEJLWW|5.0|My son loves the unique color combination, we have not seen it in any stores.  He has received multiple compliments already.  This is his 4th or 5th pair of Crocs and they really hold up well to his rough wear and tear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and competitive. My friends and I are constantly trying to be the best. It is indeed a really fun and awesome game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Should add reprimanded class, would be a cool class, could summon warriors and such to fight for u, or summoner,
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show! So much that I watched the first 2 seasons in 2 days! Thank you for streaming them!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game has awesome graphics and a genuinely unique and user friendly UI but is a too geared towards spending real money to enjoy to the fullest.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great game for when you just want to kill some time. The neck cracking sound is a little creepy yet funny.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|You pay for what you get. This microphone had a constant low rumble that sounded like wind noise, while any voices were tinged with a tinny electronic whine. Just awful, poor quality. Returned mine right away. Don't buy it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|So many different games in it, you don't get bored to fast. There are several games to a level and lots of levels so you play for a while :)
B00BQHA06A|5.0|This album sounded like a mix of everything HIM has ever made. There are parts where it gets more experimental than usual, there are parts that make me think of Darklight, of Razorblade Romance, of Venus Doom. It's another master piece. Not to mention the album art is amazingly complicated. The script on the snake is Tears on Tape written in Malachim. I love this album!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I like British television so am enjoying this season and hope to have time to watch the rest in the future.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy the format. Also I think I win more games on Blitz. I also like the slots in between Bingo games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a great game me and my cousin love love love this game...<br />Denfility download despicable me: minion rush!!!!!!!!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This game is awesome but you have to get minecraft pocketed edition first  you can change your gameod put your stuf in a chest<br />Or it will delete
0385536828|5.0|Oh boy, I *loved* this book.  Couldn't put it down. Definitely one of McEwan's very best.  I agreed with all the five star reviews and don't quite get what the one-star folk find fault with.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Sucks so bad your time I can't even finish building my house I hate it so much<br />I don't recommend this horrible game boooooooo this game
B00DU74U74|4.0|I liked it. Better than some movies out there and the story was somewhat original. Not too girly and better than twilight if your not in to that sort of movie like me.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I love this movie it keep me on my seat.  I really loved the ending and will watch it again soon.
B001SZ8Y72|4.0|A little different, but  a fun evening of entertainment. I'm not into movies for social commentary, but this one was enjoyable to watch.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|i always felt there is the best of life in heaven and look forward to being with our Lord and Savior.This is well written will help the none believers  Betty .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love dystopian series! Very entertaining concept and well written too. That's a combo I really enjoy reading. Highly recommend.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This show has a great storyline.  It does develope the characters slowly, so don't give up too soon.  The action scenes and CGI aren't bad for tv.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|In the past I have tried many different online and offline services to try and manage projects as well as personal things. The systems that I tried in the past did not deal with the fact that what you have to store for a project would be a myriad of different types of data e.g. links to websites, videos, images, cutsheets, datasheets, manuals, etc. Evernote does this superbly. I have never been able to retrieve data this quickly in my life. And the fact that is syncs is icing on the cake. Just an overall great app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series. Amazon was the only carrier of season 3.  Highly recommend it.  Looking forward to season four.  Thanks, Amazon!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's a great book with believable characters. It pulls you in and makes you want more at the end of each chapter. Also, Clary, the main character is someone who (while she may be very naive in some cases) you can relate with on multiple occassions.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'm a guy, so I like the fast pace action!  He's one of the good guys that you root for!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's a great book that pulls you in and leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter. I love how the chapters are set up: his perspective then hers. It's a great read that I suggest to anyone who loves a mystery.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I enjoyed this because of real life...it was humorous and heart warmingly painful all at once... Even if you've never experienced anyone close with cancer... We've all experienced loss of hope or love... And yet to come back full circle to thankfulness of what has been experienced and discovered.<br /><br />It's a beautiful reality of a persons thought life... Even though made up (fiction) people think these things... I love the beauty of honest thoughts even when they are negative sometimes.... It's done in a humorous way sort of... It's just good... Thought provokingly good....and perhaps it's where I am at in my own life that I enjoyed it so much.... It's a look at Sunday through Saturday of a persons deteriorating life... It may be boring to some... It's beauty in the small things.... Anyway ...<br />WP
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Solve the mystery by going to different location within the town<br />and gathering the items needed to move to the next clue.
B00BB8OHMW|4.0|I have seen this movie a few times before, and enjoy it each time.  I would recommend it to anyone for it's fine acting and the twist on an old storyline.
B007X6SMD6|5.0|This short introduction is exactly what it is. No frills but a good starting point if you want to do AWS.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This is a must see movie.  Even though I have seen it several times before, it always captivates my attention.  The acting is very good, I just wish the Phantom had a stronger voice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun tryin to figure out these puzzles.  I can't wait for more floors to come out.
B002JXK5VU|2.0|I really can't see what critics liked about this show. The production value is low.  The stories are mundane.  The supposed humor is nonexistent.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Got this as free as app of the day. Wouldn't mind paying for it though. Easy to use, very fast rendering on my Nexus 4. Totally recommended.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Printer is an old foggy purchased in 1998 in Italy (NEX) yet it is still working and this product is what keeps it alive.<br /><br />Inexpensive, reliable and standardized!<br /><br />What can we ask other than that from this invisible part of a printer?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I stumbled upon this heart wrenching story on youtube and when I found out there was a book I had to read it, it is quite some journey the author took, and to even think it was based off of true events is just heart breaking.<br />I am thrilled to know she is out of that situation.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Not as uplifting as I wanted it to be, but maybe my expectations for a book about terminally ill characters were inappropriate. Wouldn't say that I couldn't put it down but it's worth reading if you have time and want to extract some great quotes about life and death and sick people. Didn't make me cry but I (quite fortunately) have also never experienced cancer in myself or in loved ones.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|After a year's use my Kindle was barely useable. I repeatedly received out of memory errors. After running Clean Master my Kindle was purged of nearly 3 gigs of junk files, ads, and a bloated cache.  I love using my Kindle again.
147674355X|4.0|I really enjoyed the emotional roller coaster that was hopeless. I may not be the best at predicting the plot twists in most books so maybe it was fitting that I was shocked at the climax of this story. I was told by a friend that I wouldn't be able to put this book down and that friend was right. You won't be disappointed by investing your time in this book and I would highly recommend it to fellow fiction readers.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is always good, but the songs on this CD are spectacular. The songs are energetic and uplifting. Plus, his tone is great (as always). I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good vocal music.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|What I love about this book the most is the life lessons and morals we all go through and learn. Not only the life lessons that are hard, but the good times and funny moments that happen with a family. The writer has the best way of describing things and telling a story so that it is told with humor in some areas and with a sober tone when needed. Love it!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was a well thought out great read!  Loved the characters and can't wait to read the other stories in the series!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|i enjoyed the entire season..sub plots  and plots.  Strong yet vulnerable woman. I watched the whole season in 3 days
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I absolutely love this app! It has a great working calculator but it keeps asking for updates and there are so many pop up ads. Other than that it is a great working app! ;)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty awesome game.  It really keeps your attention. Cant wait for the new roomed to come available.
B005HF0GMA|5.0|manages to stay real and keep the characters likeable, plots are good enough to keep you interested enough to watch
B009LRE040|1.0|Nearly as bad as that Batman movie with Arnold.  It was 2.5 hours I will never get back.  Completely implausible plot line.  Melodramatic over the top acting.  Cheesy special effects.  Just a terrible movie.  Cannot believe it made as much money as it did.  Go watch Oblivion instead - way better movie, not sure why it never made much cheddar.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best discovery since e-mail, and much, more information and fun than facebook. I have found wonderful new recipes as well as anything and everything else that I may be interested in. Also, I have discovered new and intelligent, creative people from all over the world who have shared their interests, and some of their own discoveries. YOU'LL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  THANKS, GAIL in OHIO
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire, so this my first game I got on my Kindle. I picked the right one. Everything is well done.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Nipple-pinching, head-chopping, swearing, incestuous pigs, survival, and so on makes Lord of the Ring's Gollum freak out, hide, thumbsucking, whimpering for mommy instead of the stupid ring! A really great book. As for the TV series, they're 85% spot on with the book.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|perfect condition.  I can't wait too see the other seasons.  I have really enjoyed watching Dexter and the suspense that it brings
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic tv series with a heavy dose of realism in it. Amazing, you'll see real antique cars running about plus lots of antique bicycles in most episodes. Maggie Smith really kill it, she play so well, so stuffy, Awesome!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A great read that is very relatable. Highly recommended. I will be trying to live by these words and because  of that, my life will change!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is pretty cool and the graphics are great. I've been playing the game for about 1/2 an hour and I have already passed grews lab 7 times.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I recommend this book. It was one of those stories where you grow with the character. I like the fact that it tells about the good AND bad things he did. Adam truly was a hero. Just be prepared to have a box of tissues toward the end. ;)
B00ANKV5VK|5.0|Love the color and comfort! This replaces a pair I previously owned and is a fun color. Pink flower is cute too.
B00336G7HI|5.0|This item sells for twice as much at other stores.  It was delivered promptly and once charged, it functioned perfectly.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this item.
0062086529|4.0|I bought the book for my children based on the high ratings indicated. The storyline is pretty imaginative, though a little bizarre (which probably doesn't bother kids), but the book is lacking in colours, which makes the book a little dull. Obviously, splashing colours in this book may render the purple crayon line too inconspicuous, but a little more colours would certainly make it more attractive!
B007C1119O|5.0|Love this series - can't stop watching.  As usual the BBC does it again!  Wish American television had series like this instead of nonstop reality tv.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Really enjoyed The King's Speech.  I didn't think it was a Great as people had told me - but that might be because I viewed it at home and not in a theater.  Still well worth viewing.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I think this is one of my favorites. Just the right amount of brain usage without making me want to crush the unit in frustration.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I have to say I am not someone who watches serial shows (pun intended), but after watching just 1 episode of Dexter, season 7, episode (I have no clue), I was hooked...bait, line and sinker.  And now that I am addicted, this incredible show is leaving me?  WHAT?<br /><br />The only other man I will ever love, is leaving me...typical!  (wink wink)<br /><br />So, not knowing what happens to my man Dex, (I can speculate), IF he lives, I say this show goes out with a HUGE bang and makes a 2 hour movie for the theater, the way Sex and The City did.<br /><br />With that I'd like to congratulate everyone involved with making this show, it truly is worth the watch.  With all the reality garbage shows out there, it is nice to see SOME PEOPLE still have a creative bone in their bodies.<br /><br />I purchased and watched every season, back to back in a Dexter 2 week Marathon; soothed my aching soul.  I really wish there was some way to keep this going, it is phenomenal!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is great as far as I can tell. I have had no trouble with it saving and the picture in my camera roll is just like the one i saved. It's not asking for any funky info that it shouldn't need and I see nothing wrong with this app
B00CH87HF4|5.0|One of the bes rpg on Andoid devices.<br />Very good graphic.<br />And the thing that I liked most was that you can share missions.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I think this game deserves all stars so plz give it all your reviews if you got this game just give it all stars
B00AFPVPDG|2.0|I went and bought this book on a recommendation, but it was a mistake. The author might have had enough half-way interesting and half-way useful material for a chapter, but he padded the rest of the book with detailed facts about yoga, computer programming, go, and other stuff which, if you don't happen to have an interest in them, would have to be classified as garbage. The book is a rip-off and a fake.
B003YUSDFM|5.0|I bought two pairs of shoes from crocs, the same size. But this pair is much smaller. I looks neat and clean but my feet suffer. Recommend one sized larger for who wants to buy it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its very addicting.<br />I cant stop playing it. I like how it sharpens your mind with you having to find the different items.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I love it. I've already beaten several of my scores. What I wish to happen is that when you use super sneakers you jump on trains to jump on buildings. Although that be the case this game is still really cool and I hope more people find it and play it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So far after trying this app with a few pictures it has been great and had no issues. Many different tools and filters available and everything worked fine. Was able to save my pictures without issue. I recommend this app!
B007NVIB5U|5.0|I enjoyed the English version much more than the American version even though the offering on Amazon Prime is incomplete.<br /><br />The streaming quality, however, was atrocious. In each and every episode there was a minute-long interruption at least 8-10 times when the player had to rebuffered even though I have a very high broadband connection. Very disappointing.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I chose the rating because I like the author and the way she writes. I send this author onto one of my daughter after I read it. She loves the books also. Good story form and good characters. If you like mysteries and &#34;bones&#34; and like the TV show you will like the books.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Connelly is a master of keeping the momentum going at a break neck pace. Another masterpiece!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love a good Harry Bosch Novel and Michael Connelly didn't let me down on this one at all. Very exciting.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|Let me state upfront that I, like most people, have heard of Linda Lovelace, but I knew next to nothing about her, other than she starred in \\"Deep Throat\\" (which I haven't seen) over 40 years ago. But this movie made quite a splash when it was first screened earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, and I couldn't wait to see it. Now the movie is finally out, both in theatres and on VOD.<br /><br />\\"Lovelace\\" (2013 release; 93 min.) starts in 1970 when we get to meet Linda (played by Amanda Seyfried), living at home with her ultra-strict parents (played by Robert Patrick and Sharon Stone). Linda gets to know Chuck (played by Peter Sarsgaard) and they hit it off. It's not long before Linda moves in with him (and eventually marries him), but it's equally not long before Chuck, in desperate need of money, is getting Linda involved in shady things, leading to what eventually would become \\"Deep Throat\\" (for which she was paid $1,250). But the problems with Chuck run much deeper than that. At some point Linda flees back to her parents' house, hoping to stay just a few days, when mom coldly turns her away with \\"you married Chuck, you must obey him\\". To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a performers' dream as there are so many choice roles, and most of them relish the challenge and run with it. Let's start with Amanda Seyfried as the title character: her days on \\"As The World Turns\\" and \\"All My Children\\", and even \\"Mean Girls\\" are long gone! Seyfried really surprised me with this role. And then there is Peter Sarsgaard, who must have salivated at the opportunity to play the challenging role of Chuck, as unlikeable character as you'll ever meet. Sarsgaard does it brilliantly. But top honors must go (in my book anyway) to Sharon Stone as Linda's mother. If I hadn't known beforehand that Stone was in this role, I would've never recognized her. This may be the very best performance of her career, period. There are tons of other notable performers in this movie (James Franco gets about 5 min. of screen time as Hugh Hefner; Hank Azaria; Chris Noth; and Chloë Sevigny in a blink it and you'll miss it appearance, just to name those). I often think that movies run too long, but in this case it is the opposite, as it feels in particular the latter years are skimped over too quickly. Last but not least, there is a delight soundtrack, mostly early 70s FM staples but also some lesser known nuggets, and it complements the film perfectly. One final note: there is some nudity in the movie but given the subject matter, there could've been lots more.<br /><br />\\"Lovelace\\" showed up at my local art-house theatre this past weekend here in Cincinnati. I saw it at a recent matinee, and I had a private showing, as in: I was literally the only one in the theatre. It makes me think that this will not play long, which is unfortunate, as this is a good, if at times difficult, movie, with brilliant performances. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, \\"Lovelace\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.er recognized her.

1451626096|4.0|A wonderful telling of Elizabeth of york, though i wish there had been a bit more development of all the characters. As a follower of the series, this is a great installment, I just would liked to have known more about Elizabeth and the choices she had, or didn't have. Henry came off as much too paranoid. Also, why would Elizabeth, her mother's daughter to the core, have blindly submitted to all her mom-in-law did? Would have liked to have seen that story better developed as well.
B008Y73940|5.0|The movie has a great plot and as usual Matthew McConaughey delivers. You should be pleased with this film. Enjoy!
1401207529|5.0|Read this as if its the first time you met the Batman. Great story and art. Afterwards, read dark knight returns. Then watch the animated features. Best Batman by far!!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I ABsolutely love this CD as it is one of my favorites. It has replaced one that I had broken accidentally which I hadn't had very long and I was crushed. Thank you!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Great album. Mellow tones. Great praise for the dark lord. Never ventures into corny or forced. Good rock album. Buy it. Now!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I like Google Search a lot.  The problem is the number of times I had to enter, complete info, send requests, and fail before I was able to keep it permanently on my Kindle display.  I thought Amazon had a blockade on the site and wanted me to get frustrated enough to abandon it. I'm trying to remember if I was required to go to iTunes to buy it as an application.  In any case, I did so and Google is now on my display screen (at least for the moment).
B008JFUR10|5.0|[[ASIN:B003Y1D7UC Guillermo del Toro]]'s Pacific Rim is 2 hours of pure, unadulterated, escapist, awesome FUN. You want plot? I'll give you plot: Giant robots. With buzz saws, swords, guns, and fists. Fighting giant monsters. With acid, horns, claws, and wings.<br /><br />And that is all the plot you need. Let the most fun, action-packed, thrilling, awesome, escapist action/science fiction blockbuster event of the year begin! Pacific Rim is a film that appeals to the 12-year-olds in all of us. The action takes place on a gigantic scale, huge, operatic, devastating, lots of bashing and punching, but here's the thing: it was refreshing to see a climactic fight scene that did NOT take place in a major city, in which huge skyscrapers are destroyed, with people running from men in spandex. There was a lot of city destruction, but compared to Man of Steel or Star Trek Into Darkness or The Avengers, Pacific Rim was refreshingly \\"light and airy.\\"<br /><br />Those were director Guillermo del Toro's words on the tone he was hoping to strike for the film, as opposed to the usual \\"super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie.\\" Although the majority of the film takes place in the dark and the rain, I believe he succeeded.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But let me tell you this: I have never been more involved in a movie than when I watched Pacific Rim in the cinema. I was cheering during the fight scenes and literally gripping the sides of my chair in some parts. The characters were real and sympathetic, and even the Jaegers become relatable characters. This is in no small part to the acting, which was all round excellent and, at times, surprisingly subtle.<br /><br />Raleigh Becket is played with charisma and style by [[ASIN:B0099JL0CA Charlie Hunnam]], and [[ASIN:B000NMW6M0 Rinko Kikuchi]] turns in a surprisingly excellent performance as Mako Mori, Raleigh's drifting partner. [[ASIN:B006GLQ092 Idris Elba]] is never bad, and although his character tends to be a bit, he is also really cool and brings a real presence to the film (And who can forget his line, \\"Today...we are cancelling the APOCALYPSE!\\" Oh yeah, By punching it in the face!). [[ASIN:B005LJK3AC Charlie Day]] and [[ASIN:B009LRE040 Burn Gorman]] bring the levity and the comic relief, and both are entertaining as the feuding scientists Newton Gieszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Del Toro's good luck charm is here too; the ever reliable [[ASIN:B000T46NOE Ron Perlman]], who chews the scenery with his usual wacky gusto. [[ASIN:B008CBZX7E Max Martini]] gives a surprisingly awesome role as Hercules Hanson, one of the veteran Jaeger pilots in the Pan Pacific Defense Corps.<br /><br />The human characters have realistic drama and conflict, and their actions and emotions are real to the audience...blah blah BLAH. Of course; we all know that. Del Toro is a veteran director, adept at world-building, immersive atmosphere, memorable characters, sincere emotion, and utter terror. But that's not what you came for, is it? We came for giant robots versus giant monsters. And on that front...Pacific Rim delivers!<br /><br />The action, is, in a word, completely AWESOME.  I say that in the literal sense. The Hong Kong fight will blow your friggin' mind. I was literally cheering at the screen. When you read it from a secondhand perspective, it may sound clich&eacute;d or even juvenile, but that moment where Crimson Typhoon (China) comes out with its 4 buzz saws, and Cherno Alpha (Russia) starts punching kaiju face...it's enough to make you feel 12 years-old again. It's the most incredibly thrilling and viscerally awesome scene in a movie I have seen in a long, long time. And I see a lot of movies. I could have given Pacific Rim 5 stars for that scene alone.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But let's talk cons. This is definitely a more of a guy's movie.

B009MO57H6|4.0|Another movie for those who like Milla and like impossible odds against zombies.  Milla has gotten better as the series as gone on.  Retribution was good but some plot twists are not explained.  Most everyone who was in the first couple of Resident Evil's got to be in this one so it was fun.  There was kind of a storyline, mostly just blasting away as usual.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It really gave me a different view on the world and how sick kids feel. I really love it and feel like it changed me in a lot of ways.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a ride! You are swept up in the story right away, and it does not let you go until the end! You are invested in the characters, and find yourself staying up late, reading by the light of the Kindle, and drinking WAY to much coffee the next day, only to pick the book up again that evening and do it all over! There were no steamy scenes, little swearing, nothing that most sci fi writers these days think are necess<br />ary to keep their readers, just a great story that stands on its own, and will leave you asking, \\"What if, someday...\\"
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had always believed that Edison was the top inventor of his age.No doubt he was exceptional.  Tesla on the other hand was possibly superior.  Pity that he didn't have Edson's business acumen.  Doubly sad that George Westiinghouse heartlessly took advantage of Tesla.<br /><br />Read this book.  It is well worth your time if you want to familiarize yourself with Tesla and what makes inventors tick.
B00A757EFW|4.0|For us older people who remember when this game was the rage, I find the game a lot of fun. Thanks for the memories.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I've read the books so many times I've lost count. Of the many movie/tv versions of the Sherlock character, Jeremy Brett was the closest fit to the image in my mind however, it was time for Sherlock to join us in the 21st century. This version is the five star successor to the Jeremy Brett series. The use of the 'mobile', the Internet, the police lab etc all seamlessly retain the essence of Sherlock and yet he is now in the same time as his readers like he was when Conan Doyle wrote the stories.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This was my first purchase after getting my Kindle Fire and I am really pleased with the product. The quality is great and it protects my Kindle when on the move or just sitting at home.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is a good action movie. The CGI Hulk is great and Mark Ruffalo does a nice Bruce Banner. Mostly this seemed like a buddy movie for Iron Man, Capt. America, Hulk and Thor. I'm not sure how Black Widow and Hawkeye made this group but they are an okay side story. Loki is well...Loki. However, he is a lot more malevolent than mischievous than he was in the sagas. All of the characters were played true to how they were portrayed in their solo movies so you wont be disappointed.
193700788X|2.0|Others have gone into reasons they do not like this book, so I don't feel the need to expand.  This is more of an open letter to any writer out there.  Don't try to force your characters into corners!  The past several books haven't come anywhere close to the previous ones, and I believe part of it is that Charlaine Harris had the preconceived notion of Sookie's HEA and was determined to make that happen, no matter how much the characters protested.<br />Supposedly, she said way back when that the man was an early character, one who was in the first book.  That could only be so many people.  Unfortunately, to get there required assassinating other beloved characters and turning them into people they were not.  Whichever book it was, Bill the gentleman crassly making remarks about Sookie's tits and Erik suddenly acting like a jerk in numerous ways after always protecting Sookie caused my eyebrows to raise, and the past several books haven't gotten any better.  Facts changed to suit the circumstances.  Sookie became a world-class whiner.  It goes on and on.<br />I remember thinking right after reading the out-of-character dialogue and actions from Bill and Erik, \\"She's going to end up with Sam,\\" with the sinking in the pit of my stomach that could only accompany such a disaster, because the dismantling of Bill and Erik and even Alcide had to happen to put Sam in a better light.  She had to destroy them in order to make Sam acceptable.  Sure enough . . .<br />It's a wrap.  It's over, with all the hollowness that traditionally follows a divorce, Sookie's from Erik, and mine from this series that went so very wrong.  I'm glad I didn't buy the last several books, and this one's going back to the library tomorrow.
B009RX85N0|4.0|Loved this season. The dvd was bit disappointing in terms of special features and art work, I expected to see more Belle,  but the episodes are good regardless.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app.  Easy to read.  I used it every day to check the weather in my area.  Accurate information  always.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Got this for my brother's birthday, he's been watching it non stop ever since. We have had a lot of laugh out loud moments with this show.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was unsure what this movie was about so I took a chance. Not bad and a little show and a fun twist too!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|OMG...if you love Downton Abbey...then you got to watch Season 3. But be prepared to hold onto something...plenty of jaw dropping moments, and unbelievable twists & turns.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think minion rush is the most fun game that I downloaded to my kindle. The costumes are really cool though expensive. I give it 5stars because of this.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary proves to be a wonderfully creative modern take on ACD's original detective stories. It's beautifully diverse NYC is refreshing when so much popular media seems content to portray a distinctly white washed world, with a great cast of characters. I can't wait for season two.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|After trying the demo version, I took the plunge and bought the full version.  No regrets. The HO puzzles are challenging, the graphics are well done, and the story line is entertaining. Love Miles the monkey.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It brought out all my emotions. I cried like a baby. Suzanne Collins is a total genius. If I don't read the third book I will probably die.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great game to pass the time away with. And I can play with my Facebook friend as well. So I give this game 5 stars
B0007TKH66|5.0|Scott Bakula is great as Captain Jonathan Archer! In the first episode you see the distrust and resentment for Vulcans that he has and then it builds to when he lashes at his science officer who happens to be a Vulcan named T'Pol.  When Archer is mad at T'Pol it is just so funny.  0-60 ha ha!<br /><br /> To the die hard fans let me reassure you this is NOT quantum leap all over again.  Although in the episode Detained one could make that argument because Dean Stockwell also stars in that episode.<br /><br /> There are moments that cross between QL/NG on this show because the way Archer and Tucker act toward each other throughout the series.<br /><br />Not to be missed Tom Bergeron makes a guest appearance in the episode Oasis.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|I can't play this game in public without looking dumb, since I have to spin my phone around to complete the levels. Great if you're into that kind of thing...
B005544V6A|5.0|Was easy to load up and stream right from our computer. Also was able to run through Apple TV so that we could watch on the tv. Amazon was the easiest and cheapest way to get caught up on Suits season 1.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|It's not bad. Was hoping for more action. The story took forever to build. Wouldn't recommend it. The kids were good actors.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is the greatest. The writing, the acting, the directing all this makes the best show on television. It is so addicting.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would recommend this book to young and old.  It is a beautifully written story about a man and his dog, but as seen through the dog's eyes.  It will make you smile and cry!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Serious brain training in a fun way. I love that it's not like other search and find games where the items are always in the same place. You actually have to pay attention in this one it's not oh I remember where that thing is in this room.
0385349947|5.0|Those with the great luck to have the assets that enable them to work and engage in corporate life at all will benefit greatly, whether they choose enter the out-of-home workforce or not.<br /><br />One I wish for a time in the very near future when those who do not have that fortune today, but are abused and live under dictatorial rule and barbaric conditions, will gain those freedoms and be able to read this - and other books - to their benefit.
B003UBTX72|4.0|The first two thirds of the book give amazing insights into the inner world of the Rolling Stones during the wildest, most interesting parts of their careers. I got a new perspective on what it was like to be 'Keef' during the sixties and seventies. The last third of the book slows, but it does give a more complete picture of the relationship between the Glimmer Twins. For the most part a good read.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is awesome yet challenging to do some times its like you want to put it down for awile and come back to it. GOOD LUCK!
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|A faotd for sure. works good on my GS3. Tilt sensitivity is a little touchy, but that's part of the challenge. If a paid for this, I would be happy with it.
B001NA2NM4|4.0|Todd Browning's Freaks is an odd work. Browning's camera work and movie pacing is much better in this than in Dracula. He also effectively uses set pieces like a falling carriage and the rain to create a foreboding mood. The so-called freaks themselves are portrayed as being very human. They know they are outcasts, but find solace in their lives as circus performers. Their strength comes from their community. However, you do not feel &#34;good&#34; about the protagonists getting their revenge at the film's end.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the audio in the film is very bad. Whether it is the stream, the film itself, or the main &#34;freaks&#34; thick accents, I had to strain to follow parts of the dialogue, This, however, is a very minor complaint for an excellent film I would recommend to anyone who enjoy the Universal Monster films.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|The original series Star Treks do the most imaginative sci fi ever.  Special affects folks put these shows down, but these are well told stories that require a viewer with an active imagination.  Mind numbing special effects dampen the imagination. Modern viewers seem to want to experience the action themselves, whereas I like to watch and be entertained.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|My bf talked me into getting this application. He and my daughter were playing it on his phone, so I got in on my Kindle. And became addicted to making combinations. My first night with it, I stayed up way past my bedtime trying new combinations. For a fairly simple game, it's a lot of fun :)
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|As soon as this downloaded i opened ot to use it and it froze. So i closed it, restarted my kindle and then opened it again and it froze up again after only 2 calculations! Guess thats why its free...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's a great game as cannot get out to bingo clubs so I can enjoy this in the comfort of my home. It's brilliant as I can talk to many people and make some really brilliant New friendships. Love bingo blitz. Hope you get app and enjoy it like we all do.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Story was a little complicated, I was really tired when I watched it, but thinking back on it later was able to put it all together and it is a great story!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was filled with surprise and excitement. Every second you will wonder what happens next. It's really fast paced and a lot happens. It's extremely interesting and you'll be disappointed you finished the Twilight saga. The ending was perfect and heart-warming. I loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing show, carefully written and produced. Very entertaining. Although I must say I'm always disappointed to see characters go a d it takes me time to warm up to new ones......this show keeps me coming back for the next show.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an amazing book. It was nothing like I expected. Definitely a book I will recommend to others! If you are an emotional person, this book will get you. I am not very emotional when it comes to books and movies but I cried a ton in this amazing book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great characters, a truly interesting storyline. This show keeps me coming back. I'm always wondering how things will work out within the many mini plots. Never boring. This show is smart, unlike much of today's television. I now have something to look forward to each week...... A masterfully created piece of entertainment.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed the story line, it followed the book fairly closely and kept my interest throughout.  I have read all three books and now am anxious for part two to hit the screens!<br />Loved the costumes, good job overall!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this CD!<br />I followed Lindsey Stirling before and her CD is great!<br />It's Upbeat dancing-ish music. I personally don't dance, but whatever. Love it!<br />Love her too. Hopefully, she makes another one!
0345803493|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but overall a great follow up story to the first book. I still think the first is the best!
193700788X|1.0|I can't say anything good about this book.  I started to read the series this summer after seeing True Blood.  I loved the first ten books.  I loved the story lines, the humor and the great characters.  Seeing the HBO show and the cast they hired brought the books to life.  (Great casting-spot on HBO!). I rushed through some of the books in my quest to see what happens at the end. I was waiting for the last book to see what happened to the characters that I had invested a whole summer reading about.  What a major disappointment.  Before the last two books, I was thinking of buying the boxed set to re-read the books at my leisure, but after the last two books, and the lousy ending, I don't want to re-read the earlier books. I felt like the book was written by someone else.  Key elements were missing and major characters were totally out of character.  Eric/Sookie relationship was so poorly handled.  I can't believe he would accept 200 years of servitude to protect Sookie and she immediately  hops in the sack with Sam?  Out of character for all of them and a ridiculous ending.  Eric not being able to see Pam for 200 years?  A new child?  where did these ideas come from?  why would the other vampires agree to leave Sookie alone because Eric marries a vampire from Oklahoma?  What does one thing have to do with the other?  Who wrote this book?<br />I felt depressed and out of sorts at the end because I wasted time and emotional investment in a great set of characters that were done an injustice.  My analogy- It would be like Rhett Butler delivering his Frankly My dear I don't give a damn line and then being shot by a sniper as he leaves the house.  You can't destroy a great literary character like Eric and not expect repercussions from your fans.<br />So sad, Charlaine.  After all these books and pulling your readers into a great romance, to destroy it this way is a crime.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Based on true events. Story line covered many facets of true life. If you appreciate life you will love this movie!
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great movie with beautiful visuals and a great performance from Tom Cruise.  Morgan Freeman was also a great addition to the movie.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|maybe I got a bad one, but after just 3 uses there's a really loud static humming sound that comes through the mic during recording. It's not just a little, but very loud and pulsing, really let me down since before it broke it did a good job of keeping out wind noise.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|The way the gem move around (pulsating) made me feel sick, like when you read in the car. The game itself was fun, but the visual pulsing was too much for me.
B005PK57IK|5.0|A great ensemble of characters that are so well acted.  No &#34;overacting&#34;.  I did not watch it from the beginning so I had to go back and watch earlier seasons.  I can't wait for a new season.
B0031RS7MW|5.0|I rarely pick up a book that has been highly publicised, but did so on the suggestion of a friend. I was so glad I did; Joanne's writing style is entertaining, beguiling; I will be looking for more writings from Joanne Harris.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|At first I was discouraged because I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere, but then if you have patience you'll go far and gain a lot of \\"coins\\". It's very simple and self explanatory.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never watched it on PBS, and glad I waited until I could watch all first three seasons. I watched it over a period of a couple of days, as I was hooked.  I do not think I would have enjoyed it had it been so spread out over the years and the ability to watch it all at once really made it enjoyable.  Pretty much a nighttime soap, with modern appeal, that starts off in the early 20th century, and reminds one that the youth of the day will always shake up the world only to be outdone by the next generation.  Pretty much Grey's Anatomy in  the English countryside!  Predictable, corny, entertaining, it definitely fits in the chickflick category.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|This is not my favorite James Bond music, but it does complete my collection of James Bond movie music. I was not happy that the title theme was not included on this album, but requires a separate purchase. The cost of the single by Adele is too high.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book thief was unlike any other book I have ever read! This book has a very interesting and unexpected point of view that makes the book so much more exciting. This book is full of dry humor, tear-jerking outcomes, and even a bit of romance. Be prepared though because th  Book Thief requires maturity, and has some tough vocabulary in it. Overall, very interesting and inspiring read! So give it a try, u may surprise yourself.
B00E8B1358|3.0|It is a typical action pack movie with nothing that really stands out. I would wait till it part of Prime to watch it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|ok I love it I know this is supposed to be about the game but the rainbow is qauke and blazing
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a great series. My wife and I love this show for different reasons, so it has something for everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it's a really fun game you should get it. It's a good game if you're in to Temple Run.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I like it just have to get use to the semi rock/ punk rock songs overall I like it. This is album is a collector.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this is a really really really really really really bad game I really recamend not to get the app get a nether one
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I think that the game is fun, and I like that I don't have to pay for anything with my own money if I don't want to. I've seen better though...
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|i liked the sfx but the story was kinda lacking, as is the case with most movies coming out of hollywood lately.
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|The style of writing, the text, the photos make you feel that you are an invisible observer to the family's adventures and traumas.  I had first read the author's memoir:  &#34;Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness&#34;, and I did not want the book  to end.  I easily became acquainted and attached to the family members.  The photos enable you to transfer from imagination to  reality.  No boring &#34;filler&#34; text was a big plus.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A very beautifully illustrated story combined with different occult beliefs. Placed in the atmosphere of a fantastical circus; I could of kept reading long after the story ended.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|A straight forward and simple adapter that performs well.  Just what I needed to add more drives easily.  There are limits with hard drives, but this performs as expected.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|He delivers! Action all the way through . I love all of the Die Hard movies except the one that came out in 2013. They made him seem like an old guy.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It stopped working the second time that I tried to play it so I really can't give a review on it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the game...my kids love the game... it's really a lot of fun. Too bad it shuts down often and freezes my kindle though.
0739328271|5.0|Love Janet Evanovich's writing, especially the Stephanie Plum books. Somewhat light reading, drama, comedy, suspense....it's all in every one of her works. I am addicted!
0345803485|1.0|This has got to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever attempted to read in my life.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  I have had several people tell me that this book was \\"steamy and romantic\\" and it was a great read.  I'm sorry, maybe it's \\"steamy\\", but I just cannot get passed how terribly written this book is.  I didn't make it passed Chapter 3 and I do not plan on finishing it.  I think a twelve year old could have done better.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this garbage.  There are many, MANY other books out there that are infinitely better than this.
1400069181|5.0|I had to read this for school, and it ended up being really good. Mycoskie explains some of his strategies that help him run an effective business/charity. It's a good book for people wanting to start an organization, whether it's for profit or not. He also talks about ways to get along with business partners, employees, and employers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This may be my favorite of the three. I loved it and the way the trilogy ended. Would definitely recommend this book.
B008JFUO36|5.0|This is the best Sci-Fi I've seen in decades. I don't often hand out praise. This movie was enjoyable to watch a dozen times when I received it and is highly recommended. An excellent cast although there was no chemistry with the actress who played Julia. Olga was not right for the part. She lacked the on screen presence and appeal and simply did not mesh with Cruise on screen. It wasn't any lack of acting. They simply lacked the chemistry needed for the role she played. They needed someone who stands out in a crowd and has sincerity in their eyes. I also think once the background story was known... it should have emphasized the fact that their marriage was kept secret from their crew and aerospace command center at the time which is why she wore the ring around her neck. It also should have included the fact that Vika had interests in him at the beginning and did not know about his marriage. Those two issues were not made clear.<br /><br />I was delighted that there was no blood and gore for a change other than a stain on a shirt. So thank you to the director, writer and producers for not subjecting the audience to violent gore.<br /><br />This was clearly the best set design I have ever seen when it came to the sky house. I found their front projection quite effective and visually stunning for both the audience and cast.<br /><br />The story had some wonderful new ideas... and it might have been nice to have seen some scenes of the thousands who came to attack 50 years earlier.<br /><br />This movie did have a unique story. A wonderful clean, futuristic design of architecture and high-tech devices. The intent to bring Sci-Fi back out into the sunlight is a concept I agree with. Over the years it had become dark and dirty and violent which is a turn off and most of us are sick and tired of those other grungy sci-fi's. While this did have some drone battle scenes (which were a bit long for my taste... but that's what fast forward is for) but some of the most important scenes were cut in favor of useless, prolonged drone battles inside a power plant and unnecessary CGI expense. Battle scenes are boring and monotonous & the audience is quite tired of them.<br /><br />Hasn't anyone noticed that the blockbuster hit movies all had good personal stories, limited battle scenes and no dark, dank or grungy... hit movies like Independence Day. This movie is also one of the best movies in recent years.<br /><br />In general it is the depth of the story, the characters & interaction, the cast and visual technologies which are important. Movies need the audience to invest their emotions. This movie aced the technology and clean futuristic architecture. The relationship with Vika was quite unique. She did a superb job of acting and nearly stole the entire film. The cast was excellent. The designs were beautiful as was the concept. I thought the writers approach to selling the story was a refreshing change from their usual antiquated script formats. I'm amazed it worked. I think more should have been done with Tet and we are more interested in seeing additional scenes of the condition of the cities and survivors survival attempts (like the grain crop concept in The Host) than barraging us with battles. This movie was very sparing about that so it was appreciated. Only 2 significant battle scenes which were fast forwarded through.<br /><br />The 3 most glaring errors were the deleting of the archives scene where Morgan showed him the book of his career. In fact, there should have been more scenes of the archives and more on what they had salvaged. The second was a simple blunder in the script dialogue. Vika told Sally that she needed a drone to scout grid 17 and Sally responds that she is sending a drone to grid 22. Clearly... Sally should have sent the drone to grid 17. Grid 22 wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Someone should have caught that either on editing or at least when prescreening the movie without talking through it... andsomeone might have heard the mistake. It was pretty glaring. And finally, to hear Morgan talking about waves and bedrock in Chicago was a bit ridiculous. While New York and San Francisco are on bedrock and next to an ocean for tidal waves... Chicago is not on bedrock as far as I know... I've drilled in all three areas... and certainly would not be subject to Tsunami's from the great lakes. Some wave action perhaps... but would not bury Chicago... so that was the third glaring error.<br /><br />It was also obvious that Sally wasn't quite right in the first few minutes with the constant asking about being an \\"effective team\\". Her Texas accent was also waaay overdone. Plus, I would have waited a few minutes and established the future before doing the dream sequence rather than opening the movie with it. There also should have been more lighting in the lower level workshop. Most workshops are brightly lit. His should have been no different in that respect. But the set for their house was fabulous. I'd like to see all Sci-Fi's use projection screens like that.<br /><br />Unlike some people who judge actors on their personal lives, those issues are of no interest and should not be an issue in regard to the success of a movie. I only care how they do on screen and I must say they were all terrific with the chemistry exception I noted.<br /><br />However... we could have done without the cigar and the goggles on Morgan Freeman. It was not only ridiculous that he would still have access to Cigars after 50 years considering the planet was a wasteland... but it is about time to stop pushing tobacco products on our films. It is a gross affront to the audience especially when it has been banned in practically every building in the country... so what makes these filmmakers think we want to see some nasty cigar... especially Sci-Fi fans who usually have backgrounds in science, technology or engineering. Most of us know better than to smoke and don't enjoy watching it either. Prometheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films. Microsoft or Sony or Toshiba, Apple or Verizon. Not tobacco companies. They should know that watching someone smoke only repulses people these days. It doesn't work like it did in the 40's. It does not make anyone want to smoke unless they are already addicted.<br /><br />We probably could have done without the scene of the 3 drones in that dark, dripping, dingy power plant. I hope the Director and producers realize you exposed your crew and cast to dangerous PCB's and lead and sulfuric acid left behind in that abandoned plant you chose to film in. It can't be cleaned from the concrete floors. It seeps into the concrete floors and then rained down all over the cast and crew during filming. That particular dark, grungy site  also contradicted your intention to bring Sci-Fi back in to the sunlight.<br /><br />I find it disturbing when the directors expose the cast and crew to hazardous and unpleasant conditions. What purpose did it serve to place that poor girl in a tank top in Iceland where she was freezing? It certainly didn't add to her appeal. And why would you allow your high dollar star to become injured? That knee or neck injury could affect him for the rest of his life. It was clear he was having great pain and difficulty walking on it during the library scene. The audience does  not require nor appreciate the actors being injured or subjected to miserable conditions. I think any directors who do this should be banned for life from working on any more films, regardless of how well the movie may have done. Injuring an actor is inexcusable and unnecessary. Their contracts should spell out that they are prohibited from engaging in precarious behavior which may result in injuries. In addition to the damage to the actor, it could bankrupt a studio and infuriate an audience over the gross inconsideration shown to the cast. NO movie is important enough to cause harm or discomfort to a cast... such as filming in 100 degree weather as Star Trek Generations did to 3 star actors who could have died from heat related heart attacks as did Clark Gable and John Candy under similar conditions... or like this movie... putting their actors on top of a mountain Cliff in Iceland. Cruise is over 51 and shouldn't be running up cliffs and high sand dunes if he doesn't want to end up like Ritter, Gable and Candy... despite how energetic he feels. Guys who go overboard to overdo everything to prove their youth are prime candidates for fatal heart attacks.<br /><br />If you want Iceland... then green-screen it. We won't know the difference. Many of us have a long memory about damage to actors and stunt crews... Harry Potter's stunt double who is paralyzed. Vic Morrow and 2 children dead from a helicopter crash on set. Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet age 12 caused a life long back injury. William Shatner with Tinnitus. Ida Lupino, Wayne and crew from cancers after filming in fallout Nevada. I didn't look up any of these incidents. We do remember these incidents and it definitely needs to stop.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet Cruise will require arthroscopic surgery on that knee in 5 years and will end up with stenosis from the neck hyperextension in less than 10 years just from that one library scene in this movie. Frankly, I don't think any movie is worth it.etheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have just finished the Book &#34;Bigger Leaner Stronger &#34; by Mike Matthews. I highly recommend the book. I bought the Kindle version on Amazon and read it on my iPad. The book is no nonsense and straight to the point. I like Mike's conversational writing style and there is no BS.<br /><br />The free report available when you buy the book is great. I particularly enjoyed finding exactly what supplements Mike uses and when. This was very helpful.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is one of the best ways ever to track bookmarks. The visual links make it so much easier to find something you pinned for later reference. It's a wonderful concept!<br /><br />My only regret is that there's no way to add new pins from my Kindle unless the website has a pin link right on the page. That's the only reason I gave pinterest 4 stars rather than 5.<br /><br />It's a wonderful idea and a fun place to find others who share your interests. It makes it so quick and easy to find new ideas, projects, and designs, and the ability to categorize your finds is wonderful. And if you accidentally put a pin on the wrong board, moving it around is incredibly simple.<br /><br />Kudos to the programmers at Pinterest!
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|You can hear the old stuff overlapped and redone as something different. Not that impressive in my opinion. Defintiely missing Bill Ward!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions provide hours of fun and the short video at the beginning never gets old!! I play as much as my kids!
B007THA4FI|2.0|After reading all the Harry Potter books, I had never read a writer with such a vivid imagination.  Unfortunately, I didn't see it in this book, I got half way through it and couldn't read any more.  Very disappointed.
B00607EWYC|2.0|i never cared about these mens' journey.  I was bored thoughout.  Not sure how it won the Pulitzer Prize, but I may be alone.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|Bought the book after it was referred to me by my chiropractor.  Obviously, it's a diet plan.  Hopefully, it's not just &#34;another&#34; diet plan.  So far, it seems to be working.  We'll see if a few months whether the &#34;keeps it off forever&#34; part is true.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great movie.  My grandkids loved it!  Little granddaughter watched in 3 times in one night and she fell in love with it.
0060599847|4.0|This series was really good. One thing that I did after listening to this over and over was hire a life coach.  In just one session the life coach helped me make a major change in my finances, immediately! A lot of the principles discussed in this CD I already implemented, but helped take me to that next level in my finances in a very good way. I would highly recommend this series.
B00BFV1K0M|2.0|Katniss, all she does is hate & despair - her lack of maturity is hard to understand, even at 17.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It flooded my kindle with a ton of adds and when I tried to exit the app, it continued to play add in the background. I finally removed it...
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|great second season.  co-stars complement each other nicely.  nice romantic developments happen which spices things up for me.  had to binge watch the whole season
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This would be my 4th Invicta in my collection.  I was hesitant to purchase this watch because I was concerned that It would look like a knock off.  I was pleasantly surprised and love the look and color.  The weight is just perfect. Not too big, not too small, not too bulky.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg!! This book is just as good or maybe better than the first one!! It's a must read!!  The movie should be interesting!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was so much fun to read. I read the entire book in 2 days. I loved it so much
B00A6CT012|5.0|Can't wait to start implementing the practices in this book! Have been unknowingly searching for this lifestyle. Thank you Bea!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|me and my sisters play this app and we love it the only thing wrong Is when u go to dance club and play the game it freezes sometimes
B002VPE1WK|5.0|this is a nice buy... and really value for money... quality is nice and should work as described.... totally recommended
B000044TZU|4.0|Pure Natalie.  Great voice and talent.  Doesn't' disappoint.  I happen to be a huge fan and  enjoy all her  music.  It is different from Tigerlily but still very enjoyable.
0452257743|5.0|I always wanted rage but to have all four at the price that I got it for is amazing. The cover is a little damaged but the stories are great. Unless you are bothered by tiny tears on the spine and cover, then this is an awesome book for you.
B000002LK1|5.0|Not your average mainstream band.  But then again, who needs mainstream when you have uniqueness and legend.  Yes, I love this. group.  Hard to describe their sound, it's a little alternative, a little punk, maybe even a little soft rock mixed in. Lyrically  and musically they are amazing.  If you're looking for something different, check them out. You won't be disappointed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This story is taken with the notion that Oswald did do it. I know there is a lot of people that think otherwise but just to set it straight, this story is from the idea that he did do it. With that being said, it was a great time travel story. If you loved stories like IT and the Body, then you will like this. It has that feeling that only Stephen seems to pull off with perfection. I loved it when he was back in Derry. It brought back so many memories of It fro the barrens to One mile hill. Even a couple of the characters from IT make an appearance. Now i'm from dallas and he does talk trash about dallas which is understandable because its a tough place but it was nice to read about places that I have been to on a daily basis. If you like king, then you will love this.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|Good songs, both musically and lyrically.  Hadn't heard  them before, a friend recommended.  Can't thank them enough. Liked the group so much, just bought two other albums. Would recommend.
0815411839|5.0|Great book! So much information and insight into the entire life of Marilyn Monroe. Donald Spoto will address and answer all your questions about MM. It is clear that he has taken the time to investigate the truth and myth about Marilyn and provides the reader with all the evidence. I highly recommend.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a great series that unfortunately only ran for one season.  Nathan Dillon ( from Buffy and Castle fame) headed a great cast in some outstanding and exciting adventures.  If you love good sci- do this is a must on your list.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|We rented this movie because it looked interesting..kinda like a modern Huck Finn. It was ok. Not bad but I don't think I would buy it or watch it again.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|We turned it on and a TARDIS appeared in the living room and crushed the TV...  Seriously, though, nifty little item.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's fun and easy to use. Plus it's free. It's super cute and I would download it again for sure.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Needed a car charger with the extra oomph to charge our Android tablet and iPhone5 while on our road trip. The old one doesn't provided enough amps even when only one was plugged in. This one we can have both plugged in and it charges while we drive. No errors. Thumbs up!
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|I wanted to keep my Disney collection going so I purchased this. I actually didn't care for this movie until I watched it a few time, but it grew on me. I like it and it's Disney so it belongs in my ever growing collection. =)
0316069434|5.0|Connelly just keeps getting better.<br /><br />Bosch is the most realistic character in modern detective fiction.<br /><br />Connelly's interaction of detective work and court procedure is second to none.<br /><br />Great Book.
B00846REIS|1.0|How disappointing.  Author should try to be a little more creative.  It is as tho Sylvia just opened Fifty shades and copied it page by page only changing the names of the characters.  Will not purchase the others since I know how it will end.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Was recommeneded by a friend. Good fantasy action film.<br />Now that I have seen it, I can go see the sequel.
B004NS710C|5.0|Its exciting, clean and realistic story about people caught up in events larger than themselves and we see heroes and jerks.  Sort of like real life as this movie is based on true events.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Great fun building your kingdom, building an army to defend it, battling friends, battling others and making new friends. Playing free is good but some of the coolest things will require spending real money for diamonds. So it does slow down your ability to continue progressing quickly.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|Don't hold any nostalgia in this version.... Its really quite separate.  Wasn't convinced by the story or the acting.  A couple grizzly scenes was all that kept me engaged.  Don't hold you breath.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Firstly I got this due to the board game. And it has helped us make house rules that the app has made clearer for us.<br /><br />It actually has a vocal aspect that I really like. Along the lines of the music disc in Last night on Earth.<br /><br /> I plan to buy all the expansion to this game. It will allow house changed to the board game. By this I mean the two - three part mission that the app has built into the game. These can but modified into board game changes for more fun.<br /><br /> Please continue to think of more scenarios for this game both the board and App.<br /><br /> Thanks for your time.<br /><br /> T.S.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love this guy's voice, but what separates him from many artists are his poignant lyrics. They speak to you.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|My dear fellow listeners,  I know my reviews of Tegan and Sara are becoming quite redundant.  Simply put, their music is incredibly beautiful.  Whether it's their early career &#34;This Business of Art,&#34; their mid-career masterpiece &#34;So Jealous,&#34; or their latest offering &#34;Heartthrob,&#34; the Quin sisters have shown time and time again that they are incapable of either writing or recording a bad song.  In this time of YouTube crap and mediocrity, Tegan and Sara avoid the pitfalls of pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Thank the gods for that!  So if you haven't gotten your ears around &#34;Heartthrob&#34; yet, do so today.  You will not be disappointed.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Great acting! Actors playing several parts is very interesting.  However the plot could have been less gruesome and still told the same story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't believe it took us this long to watch such an incredible performance.  Can't wait for season 4!!!  Great acting.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|Storey is good , but the killer was revealed to early, so it was predictable already. Shallow character and needs a bit more suspense.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|One if the greatest animated movies of the decade. Love it! Can't wait to see number two!<br /><br />It's so fluffy imma die!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  I found it to be an interesting point of view about life after a near death experience.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|When I first got this app I loved it! After a few uses though the loading took forever and it would glitch. It's a nice app but if they fix it up more it will turn into a great app I just no it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This has been one of my favorite books since I read it as a child. Yesterday I gave it to four of my students. Hope they enjoy it and can read it twenty years from now with as much reverence as I did just now.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Love the movie and the egos. The cast was a real treat to watch. A fun \\"blow 'em up\\" action show.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Warched both season one and season two before watching this one. Loved watching season 3 only wish season 4 was available on prime.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I am a fairly long time user of the Kindle on Android phone app so my frustration with the current situation will probably show through.  Ever since I \\"upgraded\\" my Kindle for Android app on my new Motorola Razr MAXX HD I have had a number of my books become unreadable.  Kindle continually calls them \\"Invalid Item\\"s and suggests I delete and re-download the book.  I try that, and it's the same.  \\"Invalid Item\\".  I've cleared caches.  \\"Invalid Item\\". I've cleared data for the app from the phone.  \\"Invalid Item\\"  I've warmbooted the phone.  \\"Invalid Item\\".  And various combinations of these steps.  \\"Invalid Item\\".  I've even tried to back out the \\"upgrade\\", to no avail.  There's a book I bought the day of the \\"upgrade\\" that I have not been able to begin to read.  That was with version 4.1, now we're on to version 4.2 and it hasn't fixed this issue.  There are others in the Kindle help discussion forms having the same problems.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This a well written story of a horrible event and time in history. The story mixes past events with those living now, 60 years later.  I recommend this book to all.
B00D8WJ9JK|3.0|Um i expected a lot more from J. Cole! although I like The Let Nas down song i just think he could of did a lot better!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Each episode leaves you wanting for more!  With the last season now beginning I am more curious as to how this will all end. Love it!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This album is full of HITTERS! From track 0ne to the end! I don't purchase much R&B And JT did not let me down!
6304602944|5.0|Right up there with The Last Boyscout and others like it, this is hyper-macho, manly 80's action at it's best. Campy as hell, full of those one-liners we love so much, just great.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I really love this CD.  I was looking for one of the Maroon 5 CD's that had a lot of their top songs on it.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|M y fav sooooooo funnny shaldon is so funny makes the show ...... Page is me to a tee so manly and she always has kt tough
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I can't get enough of cat and bones, and I'm thrilled to know that the series continues with their story. The author makes you feel that you really know the characters and you become totally immersed into their world. Can't wait to read the next one!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|a great app to access the ted talks. works well without glitches. i can bookmark as well as download talks for viewing later..
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I loved it, had a great cast and story line. it was very funny and good adventure so a must to watch.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|This is a great tale of Native American legends and it took a turn that I did not expect. The characters were well established and I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the outcome! This is a fantasy world that I became immersed in and I didn't want the book to end. Very well done! I will be reading more from this author!
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|I loved it, had a great cast and story line. it was very funny and good adventure so a must to watch.
B005544TRQ|5.0|In the era of stupid reality shows and boring movies Suits is a breath of fresh air!!! It's smart witty & funny with a lot of modern drama and pretty ladies thrown in as well!!!  Well worth the time to watch it USA hit the ball out of the park with Suits & Necessary Roughness!!!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I loved it, had a great cast and story line. it was very funny and good adventure so a must to watch.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I loved playing uno as a kid and found this and got excited it's fun to play. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because you have to wait awhile or buy more to play.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Great songs, is a consistent album since every song caught my attention with good lyrics and very good musical arangements.<br />The 44 pages book (pictures included) was entertaining with a surprising end. I didn't have to do much to adjust my ear to the new singer. Well done Kamelot I'm satisfied with this purchase.
0525952926|2.0|If you read Fall of Giants and enjoyed it, as I did, you may want to avoid tainting the experience by reading this sequel.  I was sorry to see the second book of the trilogy fail to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that mid-Twentieth Century events provided for a writer with Follett's abilities.  Not only did his characters lack the dimension of those that populated the first book, but the shifts from one subplot to another slowed this book annoyingly.  Another difficulty was an evident belief that reader interest relied on regular story interruptions for characters to consider having sex, or to imagine having sex, or to explore the many ways in which one can have sex.  Fall of Giants' characters had passion and depth of feeling; the \\"romances\\" in Winter of the World seemed shallow by comparison.  Some of the chapters captured the dramatic tension of warfare, but others led up to key events and then bypassed them.  A novel of this length that attempts to link numerous families' stories is bound to rely on some remarkable coincidences, but some of the interweaving was really incredible.  As some other commentaries have suggested, it did feel as if the author was simply trying to get to the end, which is pretty much the way I felt, too.  I guess I'll pass on the final installment.
B000085RTZ|4.0|Good songs in it, if you are a Roy Khan fan you're gonna love it. The price is good too.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I never knew about the orphan trains....a good historical fiction novel.  Chapters alternate between the early 20s and current day.  I found some of the current day chapters slow but they were interspersed enough with the early years to keep my interest.
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is such a good writer, I collect all his work.  It is good to see his books on screen and that they stick to the book
B00DQR26EC|5.0|just get the game it is flipping awesome totally worth 2 dollars!!! hope there are many more such a hilarious game durp
6305132984|5.0|I am very familiar with West Side Story. I bought this copy for<br />a client. The client is very pleased. So am I.  I have ordered<br />a copy for myself to enjoy it at home. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it something that I<br />Do on spear time in this game. I love it thanks for making it
1401235425|5.0|What surprised me most was how vulnerable Snyder was willing to make Batman.  It's emotionally resonant action, which is so hard to do.
B00634GHJA|2.0|huge files transferred onto computer, cannot use them in any 'normal', software such as HP or MS apps designed to print etc.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Great. acting maybe too violent at times but i keep watching. Gemma is my favorite. Jax not bad either. hope to see more of both more often.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|it a good game but too much spending money it<br />hender's the game &amp; the game seems to be a little glitchy
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|This cable exceeds my expectations. I am glad I purchased it. Netflix, Youtube, Movie Box and many more video streaming sites from your pocket to a large screen.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The voice over work is hoaky at best.  The hidden objects are pointed out if you don't find them right away.  I'm going to uninstall it.
B00338QENI|3.0|I haven't had the time to read it yet, but I am looking forward to doing so in the near future
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love this game. My fiance and I take turns playing it to see who can get further, score more points, and collect more bananas. I have this on both my Kindle Fire HD and my iPhone 5. It seems to work a little better on the iPhone, where it doesn't seem to get stuck thinking quite so much. The downside to the iPhone is that it always tries to connect to GameCenter and from time to time will bring it up while I'm in the middle of a run. That's kind of annoying. But we absolutely love the game.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|If you are a Les Miserables fan, you need to acquire this video. Alfie Boe is a truly great singer. Lea Salanga's performance is phenomenal
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Still learning this app ..so far I am liking it :) I didn't know I could do this with my kindle fire. I can play games I can't normally play on my kindle if it wasn't for this app.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie always makes me laugh out loud. Will Ferell's character &#34;Mugato&#34; is so original. &#34;Obey My Dog&#34; not to mention his line about hansel ( Owen Wison) &#34;That Hansel is so hot right now!&#34; Too much to share. The soundtrack is fun and you can tell they all had fun making this movie.<br />I shared it with my son ( he was about 16) and we would walk around repeating lines from this movie. I think I know most every line.<br />so, go get a orange mocha frappaccino and RELAX!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Sorry. It is just a personal feeling. I know others like this movie, but not my type. I believe in evolution and also the possibility of extra-terrestrial intervention, c'mon. Evolving from some squid-like, slimy creature. Just another computer graphic attempt to push the limits of imagination. Too bad that people need to have slime, gore and goo splattered all over the screen. What ever happened to a person's mind being able to create one's own view. Give it a rest!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Just that I love it perfect case for the kindle fire .I advise anyone the purchase the kindle to get one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We love it and you should get it you won't regreted so believe me get it  it is the best
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|THE GAME IS A FUN GAME TO PLAY I SIT A LATE AT NIGHT PLAYING ITS ADDICTIVE SO I LOVE IT LIKE I SAID EARLY.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This was a really interesting movie that explored a lot of intricacies of the human condition in an intriguing way.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Smooth, rapid, clear. I found nothing troublesome. This application enabled me watch movies on Kindle Fire. Though Kindle Fire has few applications to watch movies, this one will be a good tool for that.
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|After reading this book, I think I work in a taker company.<br /><br />I see a lot of takers in positions of power, and the worker bees are givers until they leave.  I would like to see more giver organizations, but I think corporate America remains as selfish as ever and life in it &#34;nasty, brutish, and short.&#34;
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's interesting but each game is a little bit easy to clear. I want more difficult one to solve. Well, but, this is fairly good, I suppose.
B00BTV62KG|4.0|Scofield has done almost everything one can do with a guitar (rock, jazz rock fusion, free / improv, straight ahead jazz, funk, rhythm & blues, techno influenced stuff, etc.) and, as usual, with his latest cd, it's a personal work that has Sco's signature all over (not to mention the strong influence of that hardly popular music: jazz ). His command over the guitar , his soloing and his composing never really abandon his  jazz roots, and yes, rock too (even including a great reggae track). I was afraid i was not going to get into the 'younger generation' vibe this cd has, but i found i liked it a lot. All tracks are melodic, with great hooks AND extraordinary playing /solos. Great job Sco! Recommended.
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|I'm a new Whovian and I watched series 1-3 with my best friend. The first couple episodes in the First Series were a little hard to get into but after awhile I couldn't stop. Doctor Who is full of twists and turns and the Fourth Series is no exception! I've made it half way through the Fourth Series so far and plan to binge the next few days and finish up the last 8 episodes. If you're looking for adventure, suspense and humor this is where it's at. I hope you try it out and love it as much as me!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I suppose every story needs exposition to move things along before the action, but this book seemed like it was all exposition.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Haven't heard about this movie and was surprised. Acting was great and the story line good. Thought it was worth the rental cost.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I liked the dvd very much and now I have to fill in with a few more words before I can get off this review
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Didn't think much of this movie. Liked the acting, but it was a stereotypical, boring Hollywood rental. Don't pay money for this one.
0812982622|4.0|How can the paperback be 9 dollars and the kindle edition is 11.99<br /><br />we are being ripped! How can a physical book that they have to mail you and you can re sell at your convenience cost less than a digital edition that costs nothing to deliver and you can't re sell it.
0763660531|5.0|This is the most beautiful children's book I have seen in years if not decades.  A visual masterpiece and the most imaginative journey told  through illustrations I have seen  since \\"Where the Wild Things Are.\\"  - and I am a father of four, aged zero to six.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me. It was exactly what I needed to read at the time. It is a life changing book because, if you are ready, your perspective on relationships and the human condition will never be the same. This book focuses on ego and the separation of that and your soul. It is fascinating read.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I love not knowing the ending, it's a rarity. I was very interested in this book since the first few chapters and read it very quickly. It was suspensful and written very well.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Ruined by the worst theme song ever!<br /><br />Love this series, but wish the theme song could automatically be muted. Hit the pause button, fast forward to about 2:55 and enjoy!
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|I'd love to deduct some points but I can't.. I'll tell you what I mean.  This is a five star all time classic as the nearly 300 reviews will attest. The Blu Ray features a gorgeous transfer..just beautiful (it is FULL SCREEN as the original film was). My only gripe is that besides dragging over the same commentary from the DVD and the trailer ..there are NO other bonus features on this magnificent landmark film!!  Goodness gracious, for a film that over a half century later is found on endless \\"best of\\" lists for Westerns and movies in general a bit more love and attention should have been put into this in my humble opinion.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is a stunning transfer and priced at under $20 this beats the screwing and gamble we fans of classic films take every time we pay MORE for the Olive Films releases so Paramount can't be faulted for that.<br /><br />I'm mostly writing to address questions many may have who like myself have the DVD... YES, it's worth it to double dip , the print is breathtaking.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My husband, our two-year old daughter, and I all love this movie!  My daughter loves it so much that she insisted she had to have a &#34;Ralph and Vanellope&#34; birthday party. :)<br /><br />It has such a great plot and is so creative. It is fun to see so many of our old video game characters again (Bowser, PacMan, QBert, etc). It has catchy music and fun animation. The overall message is awesome (even charaters that play &#34;bad guys&#34; can still choose to be good guys!). And the Sugar Rush land is so much fun; who doesn't love candy? :) The relationship between Ralph and Vanellope is so sweet (excuse the pun). The movie has gun-shooting action, friendship, bullies who are put in their places, humor, and even a little romance. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. If you love &#34;kids'&#34; movies, you won't go wrong with Wreck-It Ralph!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Picked this up as the free app of the day as well as the tablet version. I have to say that it is the most feature packed, robust, and intuitive keyboard for android out there. If you didn't get it free, pay for it. It's worth it.
B002KAJ0AO|4.0|It's a great album but not as good as Black & Blue in my opinion. They also sound a bit different but it's still the BSB you know and love. Pay attention to &#34;Bye Bye Love&#34;. Probably the best track in the album along with &#34;Bigger&#34; and &#34;She's A Dream&#34;.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could do without some of the graphic details of the intimate encounters, but I have been sucked in to the characters--what the heck is wrong with Gideon????  I hoping to find out in the next book.
630471193X|5.0|This is my favorite Travolta movie. Has a great story full of surprises as well as moral to the story. Terrific family or date movie!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Loved the premise of the book, but scary realising I have some of those habits - we probably all do!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Was a great book that I enjoyed reading and I look forward to the continuing of the series in later years.
B00069YDXU|4.0|I totally enjoyed this DVD. Is it ELP from 1977? No. Stop whining and deal with it. The sound and picture are both very good. Some really nice camera work in this concert. I will be honest, I have never been a big Carl Palmer fan. I actually preferred the sound of Emerson, Lake, and Powell. But on this show I was particularly impressed with Palmer's precision and power. Lake's voice, especially considering his age, is still rich and sonorous. Emerson is his usual flamboyant - and at times, domineering - self. There are times when Lake seems bored with the whole thing and other times when he seems annoyed with Emerson's theatrics. But, all in all, it is a terrific show. I recently read an interview with Mr. Lake and was surprised to find that he would love to tour with the others again. It is Mr.E and Mr.P who have no interest in such an endeavor. Here's hoping they can work things out. Together, they are a cyclonic force.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is a fantastic approachable book! The characters are wonderfully odd and quirky; you find yourself rooting for Eleanor and Park from the start. I love how the author gave insight to so many important social issues (abuse, racism, bullying) without feeling the need to be terribly graphic or vulgar. In that way Rowell has made the book appropriate for more ages. Well done!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Got this out of curiosity, and have really enjoyed it so far. The graphics are good for a free game, too!
1451697686|5.0|This book is life-changing! Though I haven't taken all the measures listed in this book, I have incorporated enough of Bea's ideas to make life more simple and more pleasurable. Composting and clearing out the house have become family activities as we are beginning to focus on time shared instead of things bought. I recommend this book to everyone.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read several Jack Reacher novels and enjoyed them immensely. This story started out on a promising note, but at about the halfway mark the plot got hopelessly convoluted. And how is it that Reacher totally ignores the fact that the head villain is still unknown and at large and chooses to just continue hitchhiking to Virginia? I just hope my next Reacher experience returns to the level I came to expect.
B00000K31Q|5.0|their may be 10 things she hates about you but if you do all the right things as this movie portrays you will get the girl in the end this is a funny yet romantic movie that you truly will enjoy i highly recommend seeing it
B005TBN3EU|3.0|I was really excited to see this movie and had high hopes for it. But after seeing it, it became quickly apparent that this sequel is a virtual copy of the first one just set in a different location. The same things that made the first one a hit were just repeated in this film. Whether it was Alan making inappropriate, simple remarks or Stu having something tragic happen to his face, it's all just repeated here.<br /><br />There were a few pretty funny moments. But overall, if you saw the first one, you saw this one.
B00005K3NR|5.0|great movie great dvd great while ago i bought this still in good shape im just placing the comments now about it
B004DTLK62|5.0|Have watched this with my husband several times and I know that periodically I will watch it again.  Acting was tremendous.
B00009TB5G|5.0|the lord of the rings journey continues as the hobbits travel even closer to Mordor with many more close calls and frodo getting weaker by the rings lure yet they venture forth in this great fantasy flick that i highly recommend seeing
B000A88EVE|1.0|I watched this movie when it came out being a Bowie fan, it did not seem then to have a well written storyline, so 37 years later I watched it again with the same results. I give it 1 star for the acting of Bowie, Rip Torn and other cast members however as far as the writing is concerned it is definitely below a B grade movie. This is more of a attempt at a XXX sci fiction movie than a sci fiction movie. Only die hard fans of Bowie would pay the outrageous price being asked, it is not worth .50 cents.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|a trip to Europe turns into a whole lot more in this comedy when these friends embark on the journey of their life i highly recommend seeing this movie its very funny
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|it's addicting and fun in the beginning then it's just some some boring game Pewdiepie is AWESOME and is a boss
B000022TSW|5.0|south park does its jokes in this battle with Canada such a funny movie i really enjoyed watching it and laughing the whole time i highly recommend seeing it
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining. Of course, it helps to be well past the age of 50  to understand some of the struggles the  characters are forced to deal, that stuff that comes from advancing age. For a non-romantic, I was surprised that one of the story lines relating to a misplayed love interest from long ago hit rather close to home... overall this movie is well worth watching.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This weather app is easy to use.  I added to my kindle fire hd and am very happy with it. You can add different locations to  see what the weather is doing on your travels.  I like all the options it gives.  And the background on the screen is nicely done.
193700788X|2.0|I love all the Sookie Books, but this one was so wrong! It felt like it was rushed and written by someone who knows nothing about these books! The first 10 books were great, but I would not recommend reading the last 3! Charlaine is a very good author, I just did not get this one, sorry.
0399159347|5.0|This is the first of Liane Moriarty's books that I have read and I am hooked. I picked this novel from Amazon's \\"must read\\" for August and it did not disappoint.  From the very beginning as Cecilia (a/k/a Mom of the Year) finds a letter from her husband tucked away in a bin of family financial records, I was right there with her as she struggled with the decision to open the letter as well as the consequences she faced in the aftermath.  At the same time, we are introduced to Rachel, who is trying her best to live a life after the ultimate tragedy, and to Tess who has to make life altering decisions following her idiot husband's transgression.  The manner in which these women, and the other ancillary characters, are interwoven is compelling.  I loved each and every page and was so forlorn when it came to an end...
1781162646|5.0|From beginning to end, this book was amazing. It isn't much on the scary side. It is mysterious and will keep you turning the pages. I fell in love with the characters, they're unique and have something lovable about them! I'm kinda bummed that it was so short, compared to other King novels that is. But it was definitely worth it anyway, I recommend it.
0756686970|4.0|My twin 7 year old sons just love this book & the Star Wars figure that's included. A great book to add to your Star Wars collection.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fast paced, quick turn of events keeps the viewer anticipating more. Just observing the facial expressions of the two main characters interacting with one another keeps me smiling!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Good book, well researched and written. I cannot say.he has changed my views nor does he give a definitive solution to our understanding of Jesus. But, he has very compelling arguments that makes this read very worthwhile. Any self proclaimed Christian or religious scholar would do well to read this. Even disagreeing with his ultimate conclusion, I learned a lot from the book.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Olstead has a heavenly voice, and she sings a little of evrything.  Sometimes she sounds like a 1940s jazz vocalist, but she also sings pop, country, blues, R&B.  I can't believe she's as young as she is!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Between the veteran cast and a quirky/witty adventure script, you cannot go wrong with this movie!! I enjoyed it even more the second time...so many little moments not caught the first time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written but perhaps I wasn't prepared for such a far fetched scenario. Some gal spending months and even years on a gotcha didn't appeal.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Simply it is like most fb games. You get so much energy and have to wait for it to refill. You can buy things with real money if you want. But so far for me you don't have to if you don't want to. I would give it five stars, but for some reason it doesn't want to connect to Facebook. Otherwise it is fun so far.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is truly a role that Peter Falk made his own.  It was said this was one of the more expensive series to make.  All the different locations in and around LA.<br />For a Columbo addict this is highly recommended.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome graphics frequent rewards COOL avatars all around great game. Reminds me of game night with my kids! Great fun
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Nuff said - we LOVE this collection of songs - really great stuff.  Eclectic and Aimee sounds wonderful - as expected!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game I love it!!! It's so addictive that I play it for hours, no matter where I'am. Very interesting and there is always something new.
B002MGGM9I|1.0|In the subgenre of pshycological thrillers known as the \\"Mindf***\\" category, Donnie Darko is among the most liked and well-known. I have no idea why. Creating a confusing mess and explaining nothing about itself is not a Mindblow. DD shows demonic posession, talks about the possibility of time travel, and this is sll supposedly leading up to the prevention of doomsday. No attempt is made to explain how doomsday is prevented using a single jet engine. Nor why the incident with said jet engine repeats itself. Or why Donnie's letter to the old woman makes no damned sense at all. The list goes on and on with all the unexplained *wtf?!* moments in this film.<br /><br />Of course, there are those that argue that Donnie Darko has no plot holes. The theories offered by internet folk to explain DD speak of superpowers, \\"tangent\\" universes, \\"the manipulated dead\\", etc. They make sense when you read them. These theories are worth checking out, because there is probably no way your brain will jump to such farfeched conclusions, based on the little-or-no info the film gives you in its supernatural aspects. Here's my theory: DD is a badly made movie that could have been compelling if it wasn't so lazy. Surely the taseless, pointless discussion about how smurfs relieve their sexual urges, could have been lopped to make room for explainations. Same with the sex-obsessed hypnotherapy session. why are scenes like these allowed to exist when they do nothing but juxtapose the movie's cerebral/mysterious tones?<br /><br />I don't necessarily need the solution to the puzzle spoon-fed to me. I do ask that it explain itself SOMEHOW. Because Donnie Darko dosen't, it fails as a psychological thriller, not to mention a Mindblow.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I enjoy this game. I even let my daughter play. I still haven't watched the movie yet. Hope everyone likes it as much as we do.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Purchased this Minecraft set for my son for this coming Christmas. Bought it early because I figured it might be harder to find closer to the holidays. I was excited to see it looks just like Mindcraft game he so loves.  Can't wait to see his reaction when he opens Christmas morning.  His favorite things are Lego and Mindcraft!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony. It is a fun game but warning can be very frustrating at times. But it is still one of the best games I have ever played. It takes skill, and you probably have to be 8 years or older to play.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Could not put down! Gaiman spins an amazing tale evocative of my own childhood \\"memories\\". I purchased the book at 3 pm and finished before bed. Led to some interesting dreams. Can't wait for his next book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|NEEDS UPDATE it needs an update we NEED 8.0.0 gender eyes and more blocks better graphics caves emarled.can you please update.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The writing is excellent and the acting by every actor is beliveable and billiant! One can experience how life was back in that time.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I Like This Game The New Atom Is Pretty Sick The Custom Is Also Cool But The Painting Sucks Over All It's A Great Game.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Like the first season, this show continues to be captivating.  The acting is real and one can realize how life under King Henry the 8th was back then.
B000002LCI|5.0|Dude, if you're picking this up now its because you need to replace your copy of this post-mod synth-pop masterpiece.  I think DM peaked on this album.  Yes yes, I know they had bigger hits in later years but this CD track for track contains the band's richest and most pure syth tunes money can buy.  Early 90s saw the band reconfigure, start to follow the pack (instead of leading it), and lose sight of the DM prize for the sake of the $$$ (eh, it happens).  When Dave started channeling his personal hero Neil Young is right about the same time I tuned out.  Grab this last of the great ones and impress your friends and neighbors with just how &#34;weird&#34; you really were 'back in the day' - which was a Thursday.
0307408833|1.0|This is the first time I have tried to make gluten free cookies. I have made standard cookies for years, with great results. I tried the recipe on page 73 for Sugarplum Cookies for a party that my daughter wanted to attend. They were supposed to resemble thumbprint cookies. However, halfway through the baking time, the cookies collapsed into a shapeless, flat form. I'm sure my daughter will be terribly disappointed. I hope they will be edible and tasty, because I bought very expensive ingredients to make them...<br /><br />The book is lovely, but I don't trust the recipes. The book is going to Goodwill, if not the trashbin.
B000056VJ7|5.0|this would be it - there may be many other bat out of hell sequels but I would do anything for love - but I can't do that.  This one is the real deal with such hits as Love by the Dashboard light, Bat Out of Hell, and You Took the Words Right Out of my Mouth.  There isn't a stinker on board of this 70's rock opera mega-hit.  I remember seeing Meatloaf live on TV belting out tunes from this one when I was just out of footed PJs... rock on
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|You already know whats about to happen but it's personal when you follow this families struggle to stay alive and find each other. The tsunami of 2004 almost went past me because at the time my mom was in the hospital dying, a quarter of a million people were wiped off the face of the earth and my world was centered on that one woman. Life is odd when you can't deal with any thing else the brain shuts down. Honestly it's why I remember the date of the tsunami and will never forget it.<br /><br />The movie made the tsunami personal, to see the devastation of this one area knowing there were many more places hit just as hard - you wonder, what if that was my family what would we have done differently. The movie doesn't try to drag a tear out of you instead it presents itself with the facts of what happened and how this family survived the impossible.<br /><br />The acting was very good especially by the kids in the film. I was concerned it would be to sad or horrific but it wasn't and I'll watch it again.
B007N85POS|5.0|Come on now, you know Angry Birds is a guilty pleasure and this is a quirky fun tie in to the film :]  Especially good for those moments when sitting at a doctor's office or some similar situation calls for something to keep the kids quiet and entertained - volume on low and the little ones are happy for hours :]
1451627297|5.0|Really, really loved this book.  It catches you quickly and keeps you til the end.  You want so much for George to be successful and when you realize that the &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; makes it an impossibility, it is almost heartbreaking.  Stephen<br />King proves once again that he is THE master storyteller.  This is one is a keeper and one to read again.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I use this to get away from the facebook drama. It gets all your friends together to chat about any and everything without the drama.
B004LROUNG|5.0|What a great book, my favourite  Grisham book so far.  I chuckled all through it, the humour and the characters were right on.  I didn't know Grisham wrote comedies, and I am so glad to have found this.
B0055S348W|1.0|I got this hoping to print but nothing happened.  Wrote the tech , explained what happened.  He told me that the printed I wanted to use was not supported and there was no future plans of support for the printer.<br /><br />Now I have a print share that can not be used.  I will sell it CHEEP, who wants to buy it???
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Four CDs and an assembly of great artists from various generations... I would buy it for the Ziggy Marley Blowin in the Wind alone.... but really an eye opener hearing so many Dylan favorites done in different styles. Thrilled with my purchase. I got the CDs.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was worth reading, but not wonderfully written.  It's one person's perspective, so is limited in that way.<br />It did give me much insight to our prison system here in the US and how the war on drugs and mandatory sentencing has gotten completely out of hand, destroying entire communities while failing to offer any kind of rehabilitation or options for the people caught in this lifestyle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is way more interesting than many other shows on TV.  There's a little more intelligence here.  Even my son likes to watch it with me.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I used this app for nearly a year so I would know whether that day was a good or bad day to ride a motorcycle. Then figured out that it doesn't update you on the weather. I got caught in the rain. When I got home, the app still said it was cloudy with 30 percent chance of rain. I'm sick of this app.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Best album that I have purchased in a long while. My husband listens to it on repeat every time we get in the car.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very good game and time consuming. Not something you can beat in a day or month really. Some challenging puzzles as well. All in all worth the download.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game its a really good game and its for any age that's why it's so good
B004LROMWU|5.0|Not feeling good prior to a pending surgery And I saw the first 2 Season 1 episodes on cable.  I bought the first and second seasons on DVD to watch during recuperation.  The show reminds me of classic sci fi movies.  I hadn't seen any of the 3rd season on cable so I'm looking forward for the DVD Season 3 release.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book had great tips for any situation. It isn't to long of a book to get bored with and never finish. It is easy , broken down in many categories, and anyone can benefit from these tips. Since communication is important between family, friends, co workers, social gatherings, this is the best book to help. Got 30 minutes for better communication skills?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not to difficult to play, actually pretty cool. It's already beginning to make me think  of great security measures to take at home.two thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!! Perfect for playing on the go. Only problem is that mine wont download on one of my kindles):
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so User friendly. I used my kids birthday to tailor it for them to play with me and it is still challenging. I love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is so much more realistic than the first temple run  it is also so much better than the first one
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have no way to describe this story that would do it justice.  But it is about deepest love, agonizing pain, the most important questions and philosophical answers, all told with wry humor, wonderful vocabulary and literary references, as experienced  and in the voice of a few very special teens.  And for those of us who are lucky enough to have loved and lost to cancer but would do it again, and/or those of us lucky enough to have intelligent, humorous deep-thinking children like Hazel and Augustus, this book was written for you.  And for me.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|i love the album!!!i have it on all my devices!! fast download !! Imagine Dragons are fun to listen to!!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Gaga has done it again. Applause is so far beyond trivial pop music, that the industry would like to feed us, as to be a genre on its own. I suppose that's what Ga meant to do - when coining the word, \\"ArtPop\\". She has coupled intelligent writing with hook after hook of perfectly crafted music and beat. Bravo.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins made the end of this series riveting and exciting as always, but way better than any other book. I crave more!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Character development exceptional.  Nuances of friendships explored.  Matthew McConaughey exhibits a more interesting and broader  spectrum of acting skills than his more typical romantic pretty boy roles.<br />Captured essence of southern demographics.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|The game is so great but what really makes me mad is how they give coins to play if u run out then u have to wait for a scratch off hey dont come till the next day
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the books! Easy reads that flowed well. GREAT STORY LINE. I wish i already was readying the 4th book
160459201X|3.0|The Power of your subconscious mind by Joseph Murphy was a good book but not great.  I was very excited reading his first few chapters.  It had everything then about half way through something shifted and I struggled to complete the book.  This book is out of date, there is much new and exciting information that states there is more than just the subconscious mind at work.  But I am sure this book at the time written was excellent.
B00846REIS|5.0|this was my favrite one because the story needed to keep going. I am glad the books are not done yet. I hope she writes many more
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|who cares if its not movable?  it looks exactly like heisenberg and it looks great on my shelf. very cool figure indeed! comes with a bag of money and a small bag of blue meth.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|loved the books! Easy reads that flowed well. GREAT STORY LINE. I wish i already was readying the 4th book if it were written. I am excited to see what will be written next
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I found this game a real mind bender. Makes you think and think hard. Challenging and fun!  Being among the world 's worst spellers,  I'm challenged on that  level too.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|I am a fan of horrific macabre films.  I have never seen something yet that had shaken me up, until I saw A Serbian Film.  I couldn't go to sleep for a while after watching it. Maybe I shouldn't have watched this film right before bedtime. Obviously, I underestimated this movie.  If you want to see this film, be prepared for your mind to be raped. Even though this film was the most disturbing film I have ever seen, I give it 5 stars because it achieved a goal that all film makers of gore try to achieve.  It picks you up, shakes you violently, creeps into your sanity till you cant think of anything except how it haunts your psyche, and drops you back down.  I have the utter most respect for this film and the director.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|Until I saw this, I thought the best Yes live DVD had to be the 35th Anniversary concert at Tsongas (with Live in Montreaux not far behind), but I can honestly say that Symphonic Live is just as impressive in its own way. As other reviewers have noted, Symphonic Live is beautifully shot and recorded (the DTS soundtrack is especially fine) though what really stands out here is the obvious joy the group (and the accompanying orchestra) had making it. For me it was worth it just to see them perform the rarely heard \\"Gates of Delirium\\" in its entirety; Jon was in fine voice that night and his and Steve's performance of the final movement (\\"Soon\\") was just as magical as the original recording. I'm often disappointed when rock bands attempt to mount orchestral performances of their songs, but in Yes's case it makes perfect sense, particularly on songs like \\"Close to the Edge\\" that already feature orchestral arrangements in the first place. Here the orchestra doesn't replace Steve Howe or Chris Squire (both of whom are as impressive as ever), it complements them and brings songs like \\"Delirium\\" and \\"Ritual\\" more fully to life. It was clearly a special night for the band and it shows in their performances. Sorry I wasn't there to see it in person but this DVD is the next best thing.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Loved this movie.  Creeps me out like no other.  If your looking for a good bloody gore of a time mixed with satanism, watch it! Don't have too high expectations of amazing story line, because there is no big story.  Just sit back, watch and enjoy the rain of blood!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Its okay. Slow in parts with funny moments. The end is uplifting. I would rate the last few scenes 4 stars.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Saw the first two seasons and i had to have them all since we rent them anyway. Better to have them and be able to watch them all at once. The acting is well done and the effects in the show is amazing ! I look forward to seeing the third  season.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|In general I'd give this app a good rating in that it appears to provide a lot of beneficial information,I however don't reference it in any useful capacity. Does the application add value to my Kindle? Honestly I don't know yet.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|i downloaded this game as the free app of the day and if you like picture guessing games this is the one  for you.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book, just like I have l loved all Liane Moriarty's books.  I wish she wrote faster.  Oh well,  Will anxiously await her next book.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|Although there are a multitude of typos in the text, the story is a challenging read with interesting byways. The motion picture  based on this novel was excellent and more satisfying. I enjoyed seeing how the rambling, complex story line was cleaned up to create a wonderful, clear, fascinating plot. For once, the movie was far superior to the book.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|With all these great reviews I would've loved to at least try the game, but it wouldn't even load for me. It just kept freezing up.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|I have used android file managers since my first droid a few years back, but this File Manager has been honed to almost perfection. It covers all of the bases, and is simple to use.<br /><br />Thanks Rhythm!
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|There went 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Riveting, It amazes me what these warriors put up with to ensure our freedom.  From the rigors of seal training to intensity of firefight on a mountain in Afghanistan.  In reading this eyewitness account, one appreciates that our freedom is not free.
B00DYZ2YVG|5.0|This was a rollicking thrill-ride of a read, a must for zombie aficionados, with all the familiar tropes and some new tricks too. Author D C Rogers knows the genre backwards and offers a fresh spin on the fiends from 'World War Z' and elsewhere by setting everything in the idyllic country (is it a country??) of Wales, UK. A botched military experiment has created two breeds of undead, aggressive ones and the more passive others. It's a cool set up and the action plays out in unpredictable ways. Characters feel fresh and the writing overall is top notch. Recommended.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|This Game Was Well Worth The Money, I've Spent Over 70 Hours In The Campaign Alone And The Multiplayer Has Limitless Possibilities
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A very simple tool, which provides comprehensive and sophisticated  weather forecasting anytime...night or day. Great for event planning or travel planning.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very entertaining. Good graphics. The starting line flowed. Truly enjoyed playing the game. Looking  forward to playing more G5 hidden object games.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|AS you open more boxes you really have to put on your thinking cap to get the color order correct.  Kids and adults should work at this project.
0062080237|1.0|If you're an arab or a muslim like me, this book is not for you. The author is a racist, an anti semitic, (and no, I'm not talking about jews here). But If you bought the book, read the little story of \\"Salim\\" (P.181 to P. 191), and you'll know what I'm talking about. On the other hand, if you're anti semitic, this book is the perfect tool to cultivate and entertain your hatred. That said, what a waste of paper. Mr.king, what a disappointment.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I would buy it again if I lost it. A Very wonderful and Moving Film. Timeless. I have already watched it multiple times and it has not gotten old. It's one of those movies.
B00DS2GBJG|5.0|James LaBrie's albums keep getting better and better with each release. I've had this album on nonstop since I got it on release day. Perfect album. Once of my favorites of the summer for sure!
B00CIFK316|5.0|Great stories and a real classic.<br /><br />Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stands the test of time and is still relevant today. I reread this book which  I first read over 50 years ago as a teenager. Still liked it immensely. Such wonderful puzzles and mystery at its finest.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Well I really like Joe Bonamassa and Beth Hart together. Would be hard for me to be disappointed in their music. Great CD.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy books and I am addicted I have read through it quickly because I am not able to put it down!
B00CM9JIZ0|5.0|This is by far the release since PL, its amazing that replacing &#34;The Voice&#34; is all that was required to put these guys back on the map
B00A7CI82I|3.0|It was ok, actions scenes ok; so much better when Damon was acting. Better to see another action movie like Skyfall.
0307593525|1.0|FIVE STARS FOR THE BOOKS!<br /><br />*****<br /><br />There.<br /><br />However ... I do not recommend THIS two volume set. I would stick to the individual, dust jacketed hardback (or standard paperback) versions instead.<br /><br />I ordered my this set and when it arrived, the binding just inside the front cover was cracked, top to bottom, so that the cover sort of flopped open. At nearly $60 I found this to be unacceptable. I'm sure I could rummage through a used bookstore and find a copy for $7 that suffers with the same problem. So, I ordered a replacement copy...<br /><br />...and it too has the exact same problem.<br /><br />Again, Julia's legacy deserves better than the shoddy craftsmanship found here in this specific two volume set.
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|This is one of those products you should only have to buy once.  This one stopped working after a year. Might be worth looking for a similar product with better reviews.
B00AEBBAEU|2.0|I've heard this is based on a book that I haven't read, and that it's considered a critical masterpiece and a great performance by Daniel Day Lewis.<br /><br />There will be Blood proceeds episodically.  Scenes begin.  And then they end, with little in the way of connecting threads to give you a sense of place or sense of building tension.  You are given the facts that Daniel Plainview is an oil man, he's raising his son to be an oil man, and he gets on the wrong side of a crazy young preacher (Paul Dano doing his creepy/crazy thing again).  Countdown to violence, set your clock for 2 hours.  That's about it.  There are no outstandingly memorable lines of dialog or scenes of bonding between characters.  There's no jokes.  No lightness.  Everything is just tense and still.  Lots of squinting, people staring off camera, muttering about oil or food or whatever.<br /><br />The only real tension in the film comes when an oil well is being dug because accidents happen and people die, badly.  That I liked.  The sense of danger of being down in the well?  Yeah, they got that.  Those scenes were visceral and on-target.<br />The period detail is good, too.  But it's buried in this dry rambling narrative.  It would be interesting if it was downward spiral, but you never know who Daniel Plainview is from the get-go, he's a blank slate who just drills oil.  The film doesn't even get a pass for being a character study because it never shows you who he is aside from him being a guy who drills oil.<br /><br />I enjoyed Magnolia for what it was.. that film had a lot of sad beauty in it and spoke to the human condition in a meaningful, if troubled, way.  I respect PT Anderson for the effort on that one.  But There Will Be Blood is a disjointed one note art film about a guy who's a jerk because he's a jerk and industry is unsafe and that that speaks somehow to America or something.  No, didn't like this film much, at all.<br /><br />And Save the Tiger, it ain't.he Tiger, it ain't.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|British TV shows can teach many things to U.S. productions .<br />Perhaps The States lack the same high calibre of educated talent available in The UK .
B00B4804KS|4.0|Great job on the 3D effects. Kids liked it especially the ones who have never seen it and now in 3D. I reccomend Sammys Adventure in 3D for kids and amazing pop out effects.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The unrealistic ending ruined the book for me - wishing I had not taken the time to read the book.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I ordered this disc several weeks ago.  Last week I got an e-mail saying the order was canceled, and they were unable to get it from the supplier.  Two days later I was billed for the download version of the album which I didn't want in the first place.  Lorde is awesome and she has a full length cd coming out on Sept. 30th.  Amazon refunded my money, so no big deal, although I would rather just have the cd.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|From the looks of the movie it looks great. However the movie kept buffering to the point where I couldn't enjoy it like I wanted to so I just closed out the movie. I don't know if anyone else experienced this or there are some kinks to be worked out with Amazon prime.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love the game, but after todays update it just keeps sending me back to the play store to update. The game will not start.
B002PEP4U0|3.0|This was a great story, but there seemed to be a lot of details left out.  A story we should all read, but wish it had been better written.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Enjoy the heroic characters and the struggles faced to maintain their ideals in an unwelcoming society. Long by today's standards, but well worth it.
B000MR1V22|4.0|I liked it, it was creative, and you can never go wrong with Greg and Steve! The streaming was good too.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Jeff Nichols made his impressive \\"Take Shelter\\" starring Michael Shannen.<br />In this film Nichols expanded his canvas and scope.<br />It is a well-made drama about relationships, failed hope/love/marriages, friendship and growing up pains.<br />Matthew McConaughey continues his impressive acting streak although the star of this film belongs to Tye Sheridan,<br />the young actor who played the central character.<br />The storyline and development, the characters, the settings, the acting are all very fine.<br />It is a noteworthy and worthwhile film to watch.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|It would really be nice of you could keep in landscape while switching between apps. This one doesn't do that.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Amazing!  This will keep you reading and reading and never wanting to put it down.  It is amazing he is still alive.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of kings finer tales of love with a dose of time travel, politics horror and grammar, he is the Beatles of writing.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This game has been one of the best games I have ever played so far on my tablet.<br />The only problem was the game was to short. I really wished it would have lasted longer. But overall a very fun game!
B000W8HC8I|3.0|This book was fun to read and moved very quickly. However, there was too much attention paid to the trivial extravagances of his life and business(es) and not enough time spent discussing the dissolution of his marriage or the consequences of his bad behavior - the latter are far more compelling.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can quickly see the weather forecast or I can spend a few interesting minutes looking at my favorite destinations.  Clear and easy to use.  I recommend it.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|I really enjoyed it in the beginning but found it took too long to get to the point. just when you thought you were getting to the secret the author took you off in another direction.  after this happening a number of times i lost interest.
030758836X|5.0|This was my first read by Gillian Flynn and I could not put it down. Read it in a couple of days, as time allowed. Found it so enjoyable as I was \\"right there\\" with each character trying to figure out who was the bad guy. Loved this book. So much better thank Sharp Objects which I just finished and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. The ending was very predictable plus I don't like reading about animal cruelty in any form.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|they were a hit for the party the kids love them,  keeps little hands busy<br />  went like hot cakes,  little pieces have to keep away from little ones
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Whatever its simplifications and exaggerations, Downton Abbey never fails to deliver a quirky, fascinating and ultimately satisfying view of upper-class British life and that of the attendants and servants in the first few decades of the 20th century. I just can't wait for season 4!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The actors are amazing.  Can't stop watching.  Purchased Season 5 right away.  You will love this show!  I can't wait to see Season 5.
B000O179HW|3.0|The specials on the second disk of the Showstopper Edition are fantastic.  Excellent interviews, behind the scenes looks, revealing footage.  Not repetitious at all.  This is the first time I enjoy the specials more than the film itself.  The film has excellent vocal and acting performances, but lacks something that I cannot quite point out.  Maybe focus, or pace, or storyline?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun! It isn't like some games where you can't get past level 10!  It is challenging without being impossible
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Like other reviewer, app saved edited photo in folder called Camera in Photos. Note, I already had a folder called Camera, the app created a second one.<br /><br />Other than that app has quite a lot of functionality for quick edits to photos, and works well on Kindle HD. very good for FAOTD.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Update 5/2015.  This current Anker device (squared body) is different from the original (rounded body).  And it has a different chipset supported under CentOS 6 with the r8152 driver.  The device is not nearly as sturdy as the original device I reviewed, but so far it's plug and play.  Old review:  This is a great, robust device.  It looks similar to the Linksys 300M (which is Not USB 3 compliant), but its construction is superior, thicker shell and heavier cord.  I'm using this under CentOS/Linux.  It took some time to track down the ASIX AX88179 Linux Driver to make it work.  Google &#34;ASIX AX88179 Linux Driver&#34; if you looking for it from the ASIX support site.  Update:  Since I wrote this review I have an update on Linux support.  Early in 2013 the ASIX drivers were submitted for inclusion in the Linux Kernel.  This means that if you use a recent kernel (something like 3.10 or higher), Linux directly supports the AX88179 chipset.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I sit there  as I'm playing with the volume off thinking of the great mario background music...because I have to. Its like playing Mario but with a leprechaun. Lot of fun, if you like platform games this is a great way to waste some time. Or if you like old school Mario games.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I was surprised the critics were so critical of this film. I loved this film, everyone I talk to about it loved it too. It gives more back ground on superman's heritage then previous films and has no boring moments. It is not a one time watch. I have it on my amazon wish list and will watch it over and over again once it comes out. This is the start of a superman trilogy we can be proud of. Easy five out of five stars.
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train was a novel based on truth.  I had no idea that our America had shipped 200,000 children from the east coast to the mid-west over a 75 yr span.  I can't believe that we never covered this in our American history classes.  Regardless, the author takes the truth of that era and adds wonderful characters to it.  The story is one that I didn't want to end.... and when it did, I immediately called my book club and said, &#34;this is this month's book&#34;.<br />In addition, I loved the style of writing.  Went to my library and got two other books by same author.  Now reading and find them to read as easily as did Orphan Train.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|This is a good adaptation of an old game &#34;Worms&#34; to phones and tablets.  I thought the graphics were great the music entertaining and the gameplay was good enough to keep me around for a few hours.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|great game, works on my kindle just fine. the extended gameplay is more than worth the 9.99 if you enjoy MTG. A great game to play during downtime.
B008EKMB82|4.0|it is a strong story about bullying at all levels of society. I was a bit disappointed with the end as the theory of quantum speed ruins the reality of suicide.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|No, I'm not rewriting my favourite poem, I just wanted to state how I really like the app.<br />A few things to say why 3 stars and not 5. First of all, trying to exit is complicated. well, more so than other apps. Click on the scroll in the top right corner and then look at the bottom of the screen, for those with kindle fires, there's that arrow you tap for your home menu. Second, it can load slow, and it just annoys me. Third, I honestly wish I could do something with Derpy, other than get the bag off her head. Fourth, things get really expensive, and it takes forever to get money to buy stores and ponies. Fifth, the heart jewel things... without spending real money, I have no clue how to get more.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I've only played a couple levels of this game, but so far I like it. It reminds me of the old PC game Lemmings. Nice easy levels at the beginning with instructions on what each icon does.
B0041D843M|5.0|Hi, I'm under impression of this book - it's a great description of research regards food, nutritions, how and why you should eat what, what influence it has for your body. Everything confirms statistics data on many years trial. Really great book.
1401225756|5.0|I had heard many great things of the series, cant wait to get the rest, this is one of those you must recommend to friends.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great collection of the complete series. Love it. If you just want the movies this is the perfect package for you. There are no extra dvds with interviews, previews and/or extra material.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|If you love the tv series, you will love this book... it's the first season (Ice Truck Killer) with a lot more detail
B005LAII44|3.0|I was dissapointed in the movie.<br />I was expection more.<br />I know you would  like to hear a better result, but I'm sorry.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Minions rock! Great game with one disadvantage, same as most like it, and that is it isnonly possible to be really competitive if you pay.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote has changed my life and really helped me organize my to do list and work items. highly recommended. make sure you put it onball your devices and computers.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I gotta say, I love this app! It even helps to make the crappy pics better! I absolutely recommend it!
B005I4JG80|5.0|A great insight into another way of parenting.<br />I have for sure taken away a couple of things we will try to implement into our own family.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|I loved it.  Not as scary as much as suspenseful.  It was really good.  I definitely screamed a couple times.
B004XQX4K0|5.0|Variable Hoisting?  What?  I've built some pretty complex JavaScript web apps so how could I have missed this?  Truth be told I had read about it but it was a source of confusion for me but David explained it clearly.  Now I understand why JSLint was forcing me to declare my variables at the top of the function (and why some of my functions were so damn buggy).<br />I haven't even got halfway through this book yet and I've found so many bits of gold which just seem to explain things in a way that finally makes sense.  Thanks a million David and I hope this book is profitable for you because you've done a great job.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is so much fun for a amateur pianist.  And the easiest of similar types I have tried.  Any additional songs would be appreciated.  May I suggest gospel and Christian hymns.
B008220C38|1.0|One should never watch films of books one has loved.I felt that this film of the book trivialised great literature.It was as though the director wanted to do something new to it, at any cost. The cost was definitely too high for me.
0062238868|5.0|The story about this guy is pretty good, but what I liked the most are the insights on the guns he used, and the debunked myths about snipers, this book inspires your to become a navy seal even though I just recently graduated from college.<br /><br />Some people are saying that this book was &#34;poorly written&#34;, but as you read the book you will find out that the guy writing it obviously doesn't have a P.H.D in Creative Writing & Literature, the guy was a Navy Seal for Christ sake.<br /><br />5/5
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I really expected this remake to be good, or at the very least better than the original. With all the special effects and movie glitz we have nowadays, it was really sucky!
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I have had this DVD for awhile now and I still watch it once in a while. It was filled with<br />the original voices I remembered when it first came out. Phil Harris, Louis Prima and George<br />Sanders and Stanley Holloway. Fun movie. BOB
B00CI21EBC|5.0|Sampled the first 3 songs on Amazon and just had to buy the album. One of the few albums I can think of where I love every track!
B00181YT9S|5.0|I work with video and audio projects. I was looking for a great set of speakers and stubbled upon these. Clear audio and nice options for audio ins.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app so far. You can do a lot of photo edit options with this app! Would refer friends for this app.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The only complaint I had of this story was that it was too short.... But I guess that was the master plan.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I Love this App great for multiple uses and multiple alarms in order to keep up with a busy schedule.
0765365278|2.0|way too wordy. all the detail is sooooo excruciating. would have been better if edited down to a few hundred pages......don't know if I want the next one. all these epic fantasies keep getting bigger and more boring with all the padding. word count is NOT the most important thing in a series!<br /><br />NOTE added: something else i noticed last night while trying to read through more of the middle parts of the book - this book is also very preachy, and many long philosophical sections seem to transform into personal religious ideas (but sort of 'fictionalized') held by the author, but these don't add to the story. it's supposed to be fiction.....i'm also cancelling my pre-order for the next one in the series - very disappointed.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in years, many years. The story is wonderful, and the characters are full, deep, interesting and played brilliantly by Omar Sy and Cluzet. This offers a look, with no fluff on a lot of interesting themes: happiness, meaning of life, handicap, races, social and cultural differences. Go, run, fly to see this!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|OK, could some one please explain that ending to me?  He died, and three years later, all those people show up and find that little cabin in the woods, and THERE HE IS?  HUH?
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Not  sure how it works, I thought I deleted something by mistake could not find it.  Found it in File explorer.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I think that it should be all free all you can do is take videos and talk unless you buy the stupid thing thats why i give it one star so all u people out there reading this just know if u dont want a pice of poo app then dont download it unless ur getting the paid version
B004GVUPFE|1.0|Not at all what I wanted glad it was free. Would have been very upset if I had to pay for it. Not good at all.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I like playing this.  It keeps my fingers moving along with my wrists.  It also makes me think and at my age I need that.
B00354YA4U|3.0|Difficult to say. Not predictible but still. Weitten in good enjoyable language. Sort of a love story that wemt sour.
B004VFN7BE|5.0|Saw it years ago and have seen it at least three times since.  I wish I could see more of Harry Connick in movies.  He played a scary weird guy in this one.  Loved it the first time I saw it and love it still.  BTW I'm not one to see movies more than once but this one is really good.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is the first book I have read about decluttering that really struck a cord with me.  I have wanted to declutter for years but never got inspired to start until I read this book.  I am starting to clean the clutter from my home and my life thanks to Miss Minimalist.  I highly recommend this book and have just ordered her other book, The Joy of Less.
1863514260|5.0|I truly appreciate the trouble that went into the making of this book. Lots of advise on shading techniques and how colour affects the work. The projects offered are stunning! The detail in instruction-right down to the thread choices for the projects are very much appreciated by this embroiderer! You can't help but enjoy some measure of success in your embroidery perusing this jem!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fu****g  AWESOME it is very addicting my girlfriend and I LOVE this game I like the multiplayer The only thing that sucks is you have to have internet connection to be able to play multiplayer.
1863514201|5.0|I feel confident that I will be able to emulate the beautiful elements presented and explained in the book. She pretty much takes you by the hand step by step. Great book!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very enjoyable.  A nice change up from the other lawyer/law firm series.  Don't hesitate to give this one a chance!
1863513418|5.0|As a beginner, I was pleased to see the depth of detail and steps given to accomplish the motifs. Mine is a hardcover which was a pleasant surprise! Very excited to have this in my library!
B005544V6A|5.0|This series is very engaging.  The Johnny-come-lately character is very sympathetic.  If was really pulling for him.  I had to wonder if his older counterpart would let the kid in/give him a chance.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|.Like most superhero movies it was fun to watch.  The movie was well acted and directed and would recommend it.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|In playing this game I got stuck on the 4th floor, have explored all I could find and nothing fits together.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|Gaga has been building up the anticipation for her new album for over a year, and has been releasing teasers and promos - magazine covers, the cover art, some Maria Abramovic collaboration, and a teaser that urges you not to buy her new single and/or her album.<br /><br />This new song uses typical chord progression, but it's catchy and the lyrics are not too bad. Many are saying that this is a return to her \\"Fame\\" era and her obsession with fame, but it's still sticking with the \\"Born This Way\\" themes of love and empowerment. She had a song on that album called \\"The Queen\\" that's kind of a love letter to her fans, but \\"Applause\\" is definitely a song written directly for her fans and about the fame and celebrity that comes with being a pop star.<br /><br />I guess I'm looking at this song as one piece of the major puzzle, and I think it will be interesting to see what she releases on her new app, and the other songs, so we can see whether the album will be as cohesive as \\"The Fame Monster,\\" or thematically all over the place like \\"Born This Way.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a very good catchy tune! Definitely has Lady Gaga written all over it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's a really good app. I like it and I will be using it a lot of the time to keep me updated.
B001ILFUDM|4.0|Disney's 2nd effort, One of if not my personal favorite Disney animated films comes to Blu Ray with mixed feelings for me. Long awaited Blu Ray upgrade has its good and bad points. The film looks and sounds fantastic, but there has definitely been some tampering when it comes to the original color palette. What once was a film filled  with very deliberate dark muted tones is now filled with shiny almost sterile looking images. The coloring is different too. Does it ruin the film?...No, but purist will want to hold unto their Gold Edition DVD so they can watch the film they way I think it was meant to be seen, I say \\"I think\\" because I didn't see this film in 1940 (I wasn't born yet), so the best I can do is try to remember it from back in the 60's when it was in  theaters again. I have also read that there is a tiny edit of the word Right! said by Jiminy Cricket during \\"Give a little Whistle\\", I haven't verified that as I wasn't aware of it when I watched the film, but I will check and add to that later.<br /><br />The film itself is the best Disney has ever done! Animation, Characters and story are unsurpassed. This is also one of the most frightening films ever made or at least there are scenes in this film that are sure to haunt younger viewers! Case in point, Lampwicks transformation scene is terrifying and extremely effect even now. Monstro and Stromboli are both terrifying characters and I would imagine would give younger viewers nightmares for weeks! Still nightmares aside the morale of the story is sure to put your little ones on the right path in life! \\"Be Good or Else!\\" Ha-ha! ......Gotta love Disney for that!<br /><br />The supplements are very good, but hardly the treatment that Snow White received, all and all it's a worthy purchase, but I won't be getting rid of my Gold Edition any time soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the top books I have ever read. From the second I started reading this book, I did not want to put it down. I loved the characters, the writing, the language, the experiences, all of it!! The story very quickly began to weave in and around together very easily. I found myself predicting what I thought would happen or why things happened the way they did. I quickly recommended it to anyone and everyone.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|It's hard to imagine that Disney could improve upon their Platinum Edition DVD set of Snow White, but they have for the most part released the definitive edition here with the Diamond Blu Ray/ DVD combo. The first full length animated feature from Disney looks and sounds nothing short of amazing, but sometimes perfection comes with its drawbacks. There are imperfections in the film that are more obvious now, still overall this is a miraculous achievement for Disney. I only wish they would treat all there films with this much care.<br /><br />The film itself is a classic with painstaking and breathtaking animation, filled with wonderful songs and voice work. There are some that think these early Disney films are too intense for younger viewers, but I saw them at a very young age and I don't remember being all that terrified at least not for any extended period.<br /><br />The bonus features are exhaustive here, but like all Disney releases they always leave features out from previous releases. This is an irritating marketing ploy that drives me crazy, but since the older releases don't always fetch top dollar on the after market, I tend to keep them for the supplements that are missing from the other releases if I find the exclusions important enough to warrant it. I also like to watch the films on these releases as they do differ and in most cases look more like I remember as a child.<br /><br />There are many excellent new bonus features, but considering the small amount of space the standard def stuff takes up, these discs could have included the important bonus features left off from the Platinum Edition. I've ended up keeping most of the really well done DVD editions along with the Blu Ray editions, but video shelf space is always a consideration in my film library, so it is frustrating to say the least. If you don't own any edition the Blu Ray is the way to go, if you own the Platinum edition, then you'll have to decide if you want to upgrade or keep it for the bonus features.bonus features.
B000FC130E|3.0|This book bored me. It's just not very action packed! It meanders, you don't know where it's going... don't recommend
B00004R997|4.0|Disney Studios saw some hard times in the \\"war years\\" resulting in some lesser know or well received titles to sustain the studio with these short subjects and war films for the military. The studio's 6th effort Saludos Amigos is a charming group of short subjects worthy of a place in any Disney fan's library. While certainly not on par with any of their previous efforts this is still Disney when Walt was still alive.<br /><br />It's a shame that the studio seems to disregard these selections from this time period because I think restored versions for the 6 films during this period could be put into one Blu Ray box set  and maybe entice Disney fans to purchase these forgotten little gems. Sure they released a 2 feature version a couple of years ago of this and Three Caballeros, but it has none of the extras from the original releases and no restoration to warrant a double dip.<br /><br />If the studio wants these films to sell well, they have to show a little effort!. I own the Gold Edition of this release and it will have to do until a decent upgrade comes along. Hopefully unedited. Although it is available unedited on the Walt & El Grupo DVD.<br /><br />I hope Disney is listening and does a decent job restoring this, The Three Caballeros, Make Mine Music(unedited) ,Fun and Fancy Free, Melody Time and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. Then releases them on Blu Ray in a single box set and adds as much bonus material as they can find. Then maybe they'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.<br /><br />The Gold edition is the way to go for now as it looks very good considering and has some bonus material, of course the Walt & El Grupo DVD is also an excellent way get the unedited version.
B0018RFLN0|2.0|This film lacked the energy of a Mission Impossible.  The acting was mid grade and the plot was weak.  Would not watch or recommend
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Disney's 4th Animated film gets a really nice treatment for its 70th Anniversary Blu Ray and it's the first release that enabled me to sell the previous edition.<br /><br />One of Disney's sweetest films, Dumbo looks and sounds better than ever here on Blu Ray. Dumbo has a simple story, but it's also one of Disney's more unique animated films. It's filled with eye poping animation, the circus scenes are loud and proud, scenes of Dumbo and his mother are handled touchingly and thank you Disney for not deeming it necessary to edit this film. A drunken mouse and baby elephant have a trippy dream, it's one of my favorite scenes in any Dinsey film.<br /><br />Disney's first 5 films all hold a place in the best animated films of all time, not that I'm saying that later releases such as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast don't hold spots there too, but the first 5 have a certain quality to them that has never been surpassed by the studio.<br /><br />The bonus features are about as good as you can expect and for once nothing worth mentioning has been left out from previous releases.(THANK YOU!!)<br /><br />If you must own Dumbo, the 70th Anniversary edition Blu Ray is by far and away the best release.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robby is another hero we want to meet again...  cold blooded and warm where it counts!  Thank you again, Mr. Baldacci!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Disney Studios 13th full length animated feature film is also their most bizarre offering. Walt Disney had Alice in Wonderland in his sights for years before this film was made. Starting with his Alice shorts, the live action little girl placed in a cartoon. It's wouldn't be until after the war and the success of Cinderella before he would see his vision brought to screen.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks great with colors popping all over the place, the film has never looking this good in any other release to date. This really brings out Mary Blair's color conceptions and vision. I personally never saw the fascination with this film and viewing the Blu Ray was probably only my third or forth time seeing it in my lifetime. It's a beautiful looking film in this format, but the chaotic nature of the story grows tiresome for me. It's a personal choice, I'm not condemning the film in any way and it still deserves the title of \\"classic\\" because of it's innovative style and incredible animation.<br /><br />The extras are very good, but of course we have the exclusions from previous releases yet again, overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple, the characters and songs are memorable. It's no wonder this is a fan favorite.<br /><br />If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.
B0076DELIG|5.0|A friend recommended the book as a great read. I was  not disappointed, Connelly draws you into the book by weaving the main story and the back stories without missing a beat.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love this game!!!!love how they made the ponies. love the mini games too.love how you get so much money in little time.lobe how you see the bad ponie when you get one of the ponies gems.Get this app'!!!!!!!!!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|I believe this is one of Crowe's best films.  The script was compelling and the characters well cast.  The photographic elements were great. Whether it was or wasn't a realistic portrayal of the life and times it was thoroughly entertaining.  Good action, good story, great cast.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I was humbled by the things I'd turned a blind eye on, with regard to the Arub and Israel centuries of war and hate. There was a bit of everything in this story, romance, thriller, spy, and history.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|The demo time is very short. So short in fact, I spent some time trying to figure out how to craft an item or two when nightime hit. It was so dark I had to wait out the entire night waiting for morning. Once morning arrived the demo ended. Feel sorry for those that haven't experienced similar games because you will get nothing from this demo. Either have the demo as a tutorial or give more time. You will get your money just as quickly.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|One of the Jim Carrey best movie. I like the way that director Peter Weir conducted this simple drama and made a classic.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Great movie and better on bluray. I don't have any negative comments. I recommend bluray over DVD when you have a choice.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. i did have a little trouble with the audio. i don't have DTS and i had no audio till i fiddled around with the settings on my player, but then i really enjoyed the movies and the vendor's service.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The quality of this DVD is near bluray. If you like the bee gees, this would be a great addition to your collection. There are not many special features, such as a documentary, but it is like seeing a concert in some ways. There is however an &#34;Interview&#34; with the brothers, so I guess that could be called a &#34;documentary&#34;.  I wish I had seen them while they were all alive. I have seen the Australian bee gees show a few times,many after seeing this DVD, appreciate their work more.
B00EH49DXA|1.0|nothing special of course. just like her other songs it sucks as usual.<br />Isn't your 15 mins up by now?
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I fail to understand what a rating for a download song is supposed to do. You would only download if you like the artist or song, so what does a review really do? This is a digital download and amazon has generally good prices and is easy to download .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I simply love this show and can barely stand waiting for Season 4 to begin!  Even with last season's surprise ending I so look forward to what comes next in the household.
B001TH16DI|5.0|You would only buy this set if you are a Trekkie, or love a Trekkie. I highly recommend all the movies on bluray,,and the special features are nice.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Great game love all the side quests and extras. Great RPG reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy. Big thumbs up.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|If you like this move, the bluray is better than the DVD. That is why I purchase movies I like on bluray, as they are usually better PQ than then on DVD
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Just like the show...love it!  I cannot take the wait between sessions! This also answered some questions after watching the show.

B000IDCJK8|5.0|Probably the best or one of the best westerns ever made.  Even though you know what the end will be it still keeps you watching.  I've seen this movie many, many times, still watch it all the way thru.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Bloated with useless features. Unattractive and uninformative graphics. No radar imagery. Slow to load and difficult to navigate. A real looser at a high price. No better, in fact, probably worse then the free version. In,short, typical Amazon app quality.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Still one of the best westerns ever produced, Eastwood does a good job, supporting cast could be better, but keeps you watching

0547366205|4.0|Mem Fox, Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008)<br /><br />Of the books from this week's library haul for the bean, the biggest hit by far has been Mem Fox's simple and beautiful Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes, a celebration of diversity and motherhood. The book reads more like song lyrics than poetry (for all I know, it may actually be), focusing on a chorus of \\"...both of these babies, as everyone knows, had ten little fingers and ten little toes.\\", with the kinds of illustrations (expertly done by Helen Oxenbury) one expects. (I have to say, I had no idea that baby fingers and toes were such a fetish, but my wife posts pictures of the bean's toes on Facebook on a regular basis, and each one gets a chorus of oohs and aahs.) The words take a right turn towards the end, and the story goes in a different, and equally wonderful, direction. The bean would ask for this one multiple times in a row every night we had it out of the library, and I didn't mind in the least reading it every single time. This is good stuff indeed, and there is a strong possibility he'll get his own copy for his upcoming birthday. ****

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a awesome game it's a lot like temple run and my sister and brother love the moves so they have it on there ipads
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you're into rock and you have an interest for some of the history behind great artists and albums, you'll love this film. Dave does a great job with giving the viewer a sense of history, and by the end of the film you'll wish you had been given the opportunity to work for/visit Sound City (at least I did). Without spoiling the final part of the film, just know that it contains a great look at the art of creating music with some iconic artists. This is a great film, period.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|A dark comedy and very entertaining.  We've watched it twice already and will watch again.  The acting and actors are great.
B0090SI582|3.0|A treat for the eyes but you will owe your brain an apology. I didn't understand why if the guy wanted wolverines powers why did he have viper put a thingy on his heart that caused him to be mortal? If he had died before the face off his powers would have been lost? Why did they go through all the trouble if all silver samurai armor had to do is grab wolverine and drill his bone marrow anyway? Why was it when wolverine lost his powers for half the movie did his bullet wounds bleed but not when his claws cut through all those tendons and skin when they came out? what was the actual point of the main bad guy hiring viper when she really didn't help with anything? I thought in the last wolverine movie he was shot in the head and lost his memory but they give the impression he remembers his time in WW2 in this one? I don't want to sound too down on the movie it wasn't bad. Im glad Hugh has been lifting weights and he acted a better wolverine than before. Good special effects and amusing fight scenes so not too bad but certainly not as good as ironman.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|With a cast like this you would think it would be somewhat good.  I was very disappointed as was my husband.
0316247545|5.0|She can't put it down and reads it on every pony episode. A must have for the series fans! It has artwork and summaries and everything you could need.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I just finished this novel, and I'm feeling a bit awestruck. The plot is deceptively crafted, appearing to be low key while keeping you on the edge of your emotional seat. Mia, the main character is the daughter/sister/friend/lover that we all wish we could be - or have - in our lives. Forman's writing is perfect.<br /><br />These characters are perhaps not the sort of people you hang out with. They are creatives, and therefore a bit edgy, yet they are so completely human that they feel comfortable and oh so sympathetic.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|This acting was choppy in parts (arguably the entire time), but the visual effects and the decent-to-good story made up for it.  My wife and I enjoy watching movies we've never heard of, and this was a definite good find.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is like epic. You've gotta read it. There's so much battle and war and its just awesome. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!  :)
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Moyes has been gifted with the insight to understand human emotion and then write about it. Any one can identify with the novel's characters and gain from the experience.<br /><br />Great read and a page turner even though not a thriller!
1451696191|5.0|As soon as I finished this book, I wanted to flip back to page one and start all over again.

B00DQVST76|5.0|I attended the concert in NYC (section 1 - floor) and Atlanta (golden ticket winner - golden triangle).  The concert was simply amazing, as is Madonna.  She scolded me at the Atlanta show because I had my arms crossed for 2 minutes (only because I'd been jumping around like a teenager for an hour - I'm 46 years old!!) - I was terrified and excited at the same time!  She noticed me!! lol .......  I'm excited to see the DVD, particularly the behind the scenes info.
1477428690|3.0|There are a lot of materials out there for use in creative thinking applications.

Perhaps the best advice was to write your raw materials on 3x5 note cards for use later. Read my summary of this book at [...]

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|From the moment Clary and Simon showed up at the Pandemonium Club I was hooked.  I love the characters--Cassandra Clare does an amazing job of describing each one - -  you just don't want to put the book down!

B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game is very fun, wish I could do more character customization. And getting gems is a pain. And the crafting items are few and far between. Why can't we mine them in game? Other then that, it's pretty fun for what it is.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I recommend a good, balanced sound system to listen to the music in this film. There are a few swear words, so not recommended for the little ones. But if you want to show someone the beginnings, and endings of a professional, working studio, this is it. It also gives some insight into the world of the recording artist.
B001CB8NQE|3.0|Sad to see Carter leave after the first episode.  Glad to see Dr. Carson return in a few episodes.  I did like the way it ended, though could have been a bit longer to help with the dramatic.  Conceedering the time and money is understandable.  Over all a nice season.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Love this musical. Have been wanting to order it for a long time and finally decided to do it. The quality of the DVD was excellent and delivery was fast. Love ordering things through Amazon.
B00004YTIQ|2.0|Other than that I was loving it. Also this particular picture is not the cover I received. A very thin blue plasitc cover is what I got.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|A high quality product and a necessity if you have the latest and greatest apple computers that lack an Ethernet port and you visit people that don't have WiFi.
0451450523|5.0|Both the movie and the book had a sort of beautiful sadness to it. I watched the movie first and didn't get to read the book till I was an adult, the world created by Peter S. Beagle is enchanting and dark and wonderful, his use of words opens up the visual and the emotional aspects as clear as day, they are whimsical without being flowery, haunting without getting teary eyed. Please check this amazing book out. It enhances the movie so many of us grew up with.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|From the first episode I was engrossed!  The characters evoke so much emotion.  I simply love this show!  A must see.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love  that its free its so fun and i hope you think that too if you play this game
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fringe is so appropriate a name for this series.  The topics covered are far beyond what mainstream is addressing.  Conspiracy theorists should love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved all the twists and turns in this story. Just when I thought I knew where it was going I was shocked by the next move!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely LOVE Downton Abbey!!  I love hearing the English accents and seeing a taste of what the working class did in the age of castles and mansions.  Its dreamy for me becuz i love English history and daydreaming of what it must have been like.  PLEASE keep Downton coming!!

B00CEK9OTM|5.0|\\"Core Dive\\" requires you to guide a ball through mazes. Sounds simple, huh? LOL<br /><br />The game has you guide the ball by using the device's orientation sensor. You hold the device (in my case an 8.9\\" Fire) flat, and tilt it in various directions to cause the ball to \\"roll downhill\\". Imagine placing a ball bearing on top of a cutting board and trying to roll the ball bearing around the board and you have the idea behind this game's mechanics. It is an utterly charming and unique (at least to me) idea.<br /><br />Guiding the ball through maze's walls until you reach each puzzle's End Point is easy enough ... as long as the puzzle has walls to guide the ball. By the time you reach levels with terrain like raised paths with no retaining walls, things get just a littttttttle bit more tricky. ;-) As levels progress, you'll encounter additional obstacles, such as switches that open and close barriers.<br /><br />The 3D illusion is very well done, giving you a feeling of real depth as you maneuver up and down stairs, off of drop offs, and across the tops of platforms.<br /><br />There aren't any in-game directions, so what you see on this page seems to be all the hard information you get. There is no scoring, just the satisfaction of solving the mazes and learning the dexterity skills to guide the ball to the end of the puzzle.<br /><br />The game only works in portrait orientation, and I'll agree with another reviewer's comments that it would be nice at times to flip it to landscape, especially since as you progress you can only see small portions of the maze at one time. So not only do you have to learn the physical skills required to solve each puzzle (level), you'll also have to remember your route in many cases.<br /><br />Sadly, I can see the possibility of spending literally HOURS getting through the 100 included puzzles, and some of those hours are going to be frustrating repetition figuring out how to navigate an obstacle. However, that's one reason we play games ... the challenge to reach the solution and the satisfaction of having done so. You'll get many opportunities for both here! LOL<br /><br />There is an option to use your device with a tilted orientation instead of dead flat. I tried that for a while and it didn't take long to get a feel for it. That's probably going to differ for each person using the game though. But there is certainly no harm in trying for a while to see if you prefer it. If you don't like it, you can change it right back to the flat orientation.<br /><br />As a play tip, often smaller movements than you might expect are needed to navigate tricky areas. Learning to rely on those small movements is not easy though. If you wind up getting the ball blocked off from an area you would have liked to traverse (to pick up one of the three stars placed in each puzzle for example), you can easily reset the level and start over. There's no penalty for doing so.<br /><br />I can imagine that unless you totally devote yourself to this game for a few weeks, you could pull it out when in the mood for months or years before you solve all the levels, and then they'd probably be just as fun to do all over again.mes ... the challenge to reach the solution and the satisfaction of having done so.

0345803485|1.0|This book reminds me of a writing competition my 6th class was forced to enter.  My inner goddess would tell you that it is so sophomoric, it may have actually been written by a 6th grader too, but she abandoned me shortly after I started reading this crap.<br /><br />There isn't much about this story that is actually believable.  The characters may have no depth and apparently the main character refuses to eat anything because she refuses to take her own lip out of her mouth. That's her go to seduction move because who can't resist someone chewing on their own lip for sustenance?  And what a seductress she is!  A virgin who has never been kissed or even masturbated, but has the most amazing first time sex and orgasms each and every time.  She just has to think orgasm and boom, climax.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the living statue of David has fallen hard for her and pretty much creepily stalks her. He runs a billion dollar empire and has nothing better to do than exchange emails all day and night, and show up everywhere unexpectedly, because a billion dollar empire obviously runs itself.<br /><br />The author should invest in a thesaurus or imagination. She leans heavily on several iterations of Crap!, people peeking through their lashes, muttering/mumbling/whispering, smirking, feelings in bellies and \\"down there\\", head tilting, etc.  I think there are really only 100 different words in this book.<br /><br />Please be good to your inner goddess and stay away from this book.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've been following James' writings for over 2 years. In that time, I've really seen him mature and grow as a writer.  Occasionally he would release a book with some of the posts on his blog, but thankfully this book is completely new - although the ideas are familiar, they haven't been fleshed out and this well-documented previously.<br /><br />I read this book while on vacation, and although I wish I'd read something a bit lighter, the ideas I read inspired me. Over a month later, I'm still thinking about the ideas I read, and just beginning to act upon them.<br /><br />The only issue I take with James' writing is that he wants everyone to realize they're going to be an entrepreneur, whether they want to be or not. I had the opportunity to meet James last fall and ask about this, because I wasn't raised that way - and I left feeling that because I didn't have the burning desire James did, because I am satisfied where I am, that I wasn't doing something exactly right.<br /><br />After reading \\"Choose Yourself\\", I am starting to feel that fire. It's ok to be satisfied, as long as you're planning for the future. This is an idea I completely agree with.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and suggest giving a copy to friends and family members, particularly those in high school, college, who have been recently laid off or are about to be.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Fun. &amp; easy to use. Great product and easy way to share cute pics on Facebook. Worth giving it a try

B00CS65JS2|5.0|The album recalls music that has already graced my shelves from the 70's and 80's; however, to hear it done in a modern environment made it so cool.  This album is great the chill out with, but at the same time dance away.  Marvelous.
1423113462|5.0|I was really anxious to get my hands on the first book of Riordan's new series, and I wasn't disappointed. This book has everything the PJ series ever had.<br />I also admire Rick Riordan's ability to come up with new material even after producing the ultimate five book series. I mean, who else would have introduced an entirely new world to his already successful series and STILL make it work? Most authors wouldn't have managed it without overstretching the story and ending up with a chaotic mess. But Riordan did it.<br />(WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW)<br /><br />Jason wakes up in a school bus surrounded by people he doesn't know. He remembers nothing: His address, his age, even his last name. There's a girl named Piper who claims that she is his girlfriend, a hyperactive mechanics prankster named Leo who says that he's his best friend. Oh yeah, and Jason is attacked by evil wind spirits and electrocuted before his world turns upside down. But he has a peculiar feeling that it happened before, just in another place...<br /><br />This awesome novel sports Jason's, Piper's, and Leo's POVs, each character with his own problems and secrets. Riordan's fans (including me) will be satisfied.<br /><br />VBG
140006922X|5.0|This journey into discovering Jesus the man, was enlightening look into those crucial years of Jesus' life as a person living in first century Palestine, a devout Jew, day laborer, disciple of John the Baptist, a traveling preacher/healer, and challenger to Roman authority and Temple high priests. As someone who has visited Jerusalem and walked the streets of antiquity, this narrative is a refreshing alternative to most biblical scripture, which usually portrays Jesus the Christ, whose life is defined in the birth narratives and at the crucifixion.<br /><br />There are so many fascinating historical facets of the phenomenal book, one assertion which struck me a profound was the designation of Jesus' twelve apostles as a symbolic embodiment of the twelve tribes of Israel, to be one day reconstituted into a single, united nation. \\"Jesus of Nazareth was first and finally a Jew.\\" This sobering statement reiterates Jesus mission was to fulfill the Law of Moses, which is \\"at the heart and soul of the Jewish faith.\\" That out of his many followers Jesus would choose twelve apostles as his disciples to preach his message, indicates to me that Jesus was a devout Jew who highest message was the expulsion of oppressive Roman invaders, restoring the nation of Israel and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth amongst his chosen people in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Jesus the man eschewed tithes to the Temple priest, the sacrifice of animals, and the subjugation of the corrupt high priests to their Roman masters. In the time of Jesus, the term Zealot, in Jesus' time, was meant to describe those who adhered strictly to the laws of Moses<br /><br />This book was a learning experience, one that prompted this reader to want to know more about the man that Jesus was and how life as an occupied people, wherein the priest and elite class grew wealthy off the heavy taxation of the poor masses. This existence of corruption and brutal occupation resulted into a volatile mix which fed the fires of zealotry and rebellion, led to an apocalyptic worldview, the destruction of a nation and a people exiled from their homeland.<br /><br />It was from the ashes and aftermath of a shattered rebellion that gave birth to a new religion in writings laid down decades after the death of Jesus, not by his followers, family or disciples but by those who never met Jesus of Nazareth or heard his true message.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for the person who is interested in knowing Jesus the simple man, peasant, and preacher.
1423140605|5.0|At first, I thought that a third novel in the 'Heroes of Olympus' was stretching the plot and the general idea a bit. I thought it would be a challenge for Rick Riordan.<br />I was never more wrong in my life.<br />Riordan's latest book was just as good, if not better, than the two previous novels, the Lost Hero and the Son of Neptune. From the first chapter to the very last WORD, The Mark of Athena was a pulse-pounding read.<br />(WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW)<br /><br />From the touchdown of the Argo II to the fight at Fort Sumter to Annabeth's personal Odyssey, Riordan kept up a symphony of danger, adventure, and ancient mythology all while keeping us updated on the characters' feelings. The story is juggled by four POVs (Annabeth, Percy, Leo, Piper), and even though I thought that the remaining characters didn't get to perform a big role (I guess that Riordan left that for the House of Hades), they still got an important part in the book. Piper's POV is kind of boring, though. I think that it was too much about her attachment to Jason than about the quest. Percy's POV was great, but I really miss the first-person POV that was present in the PJ series.<br />I am DYING know what happens to Percy and Annabeth down in Tatarus.<br />READ THE BOOK.<br />IT'S THE CLOSEST YOU CAN GET TO A PERFECT NOVEL.<br /><br />VBG
1932735410|4.0|I am a newly minted PMP. A classmate recommended this book, so I bought it, suffered through it cover to cover and passed the test. I find Rita's tone nagging and scolding, and it wears on you after only a few chapters. But the point is to pass the test which I did with the help of this book. 7th edition is now obsolete with publication of PMBOK 5, so buy Rita's 8th edition and good luck to you.
1423141997|5.0|PERCY JACKSON IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!!!<br />(WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW)<br /><br />Percy Jackson wakes up in an old mansion, remembering nothing except his name and Annabeth. Lupa, the Roman wolf goddess tells him that to regain his memories, he must to Camp Jupiter, a safe haven where demigods learn to train and survive. Narrowly missing death by gorgon, Percy finds the camp...only to be sent on an impossible quest with Frank, a new recruit, and Hazel, a mysterious girl with a more mysterious past. Along the way, this unlikely trio faces fire-and-poison snakes, rabid cereal monsters, and an old, blind man in a bathrobe (who happens to have a weed whacker and an ability to stay alive after death). The spotlight is exchanged equally between our three heroes, expertly crafted to keep the pages turning. A captivating novel, perfect for any reader, sure to please Percy Jackson fans waiting for the second book in this series.<br /><br />VBG

B003XYE7R2|4.0|I was required to read this book for a film class where we compared the book to the a couple different film versions. I enjoyed reading the book again having read it when I was a kid. The book draws in the reader with the story and I found it a difficult to put down wanting to find out the ending.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Jack Reacher is based on the novel One Shot by Lee Child. It is part of a series of novels featuring Jack Reacher. They are all stand-alone adventures, not requiring knowledge of previous books for enjoyment. Reacher is an ex-military man drifting around America with the clothes on his back, a tooth brush, and an ATM card. He typically gets involved in some criminal activity when he runs into a victim who appeals to his sense of justice or a criminal who appalls his sense of justice. I've listened to three of the stories as audiobooks and found them exciting and enjoyable. But not One Shot. I was looking forward to a film version of the character, imagining Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock, in the main role.<br /><br />What Jack Reacher has is the more controversial casting choice of Tom Cruise. Certainly Cruise is a more bankable star, but Reacher is a taller, younger, and tougher character than the contemporary Cruise tough guy. Most fans of the novels groaned at the casting decision, but Hollywood runs on numbers, not on faithfulness to fan expectations. A related worry for fans was that the rest of the movie would be run by numbers rather than by the delightful craftsmanship found in the novels.<br /><br />As for Cruise, I can see how people who haven't read the books would be satisfied with his performance. He does have the charisma and the toughness to deliver a great action character. He suggests the physicality through looks and voice quite well. I still wasn't fully satisfied, but Cruise performed well.<br /><br />The story was interesting though moments of it fell into cliche. The overall conspiracy didn't quite hold together and the finale wound up showing too many recycled bits from 1980s action films. Not the good bits, either. The movie ran too much according to numbers than to good storytelling, resulting in a mediocre action picture. Which would be okay, if I didn't know the source material well enough to know how far short they fell from the mark.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire, but it doesn't seem to do anything ... and I mean anything.<br />Maybe if this were on an Android phone my results would have been more gratifying. Thank you, but I will just continue to access through my browser page. :P
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great and easy read. The characters were easy to relate to. It was my first book by this author and will not be my last!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Fantastic! It was riveting and interesting and just a tad bit disturbing. I went on to read all of her novels.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|It doesn't matter that you are struggling with a weight issue or not.  Gary Taubes explains it with precision and humor that will get you to keep turning the pages of this book (physical book or Kindle).  He hammers home why we get fat, and the information will be compelling.  You will walk away from this book thinking about the information it has conveyed.  When I had struggled with my need to improve my blood lipids, the information I received from my healthcare advisors was absolutely useless.  Nothing worked.  None of it made any sense - &#34;cut down on fat and increase your activities and exercise.&#34;  Well, duh!  I was running five miles every other day, and I had stripped all of the fat from my diet to a ridiculous level.  I was eating fruit like there was no tomorrow.  Result?  Absolutely no improvement and my weight didn't budge.  Fast forward to high fat and high protein plus more veggies and only two pieces of fruit - weight fell off!  Blood sugars plummetted, triglycerides plummetted, and HDL came up fast, for the first time in my life.  Don't think his argument has any weight?  What have you got to lose?
B005CA4SQK|5.0|It is The Walking Dead what more could you ask for! It's awesome, I love all the extras and the box art is awesome.
B005HEPN06|5.0|This is among my favorite shows.  Even better is the fact that it is streamed without glitches.  Great quality.  Gotta love Amazon Prime.
B004V546IW|5.0|If is about Bon Jovi I love it. Any place and time I would read about them. I am a big fan.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|I have always been a Star Trek Next Generation fan.  The fact that I can see it as an Amazon Prime member is wonderful.  The plots are original and well produced.  Amazon brings it with excellent streaming technology.
B00009RAJH|5.0|I like all the hits on this album. This is the first time I will actually own this recording, but I certainly know most of the tunes. Throw in the added singles, and this album becomes a music collector's must-have!
0811879542|5.0|This book is meant for older children, but I'm building my twins a library and buy anything that looks good even if they're not ready.  I read it to them anyway and they LOVE it.  Obviously I have to guide their hands to press the dot and clap and such, but it sets them off laughing every time.  They also like just watching me do all the manipulation.  This book is printed on a nice heavy paper to withstand all the touching and shaking, but I wish it was available as a board book too for the younger ones.  I believe it teaches kids a great lesson about imagination and invention.  Sure, most books are meant to be read in order from cover to cover, but what if you ignore those rules?  Like Pat the Bunny, a choose-your-own-adventure, or - dare I say it? - even Tristram Shandy, this book makes kids an active part of the story instead of a passive recipient of authorial intent.  I predict it will become a classic.
B000002KGT|5.0|This album is some of their/the most inspired work. Songs like these have kept me a Fleetwood Mac fan for a long time.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I have always loved this musical - especially Joel Grey and Liza Minelli and our local community theatre is putting it on in a couple months so it was time to get a copy for a preview.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I haven't watched my copy of this yet, I just wanted to make sure I could add this to my collection, while it's available - but I saw the whole performance in the movie theater and loved it. I've always been a U2 fan (The Edge) and like the work that Jimmy Page (Led Zepplin) has done over the years, but I didn't know Jack White, until now. I like that they took three generations of unique guitarists to sow this picture together, giving it a broader audience, and I think anyone who likes guitar and Rock and Roll would really enjoy this picture.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The mystery that is Christian continues to unfold. Anna feels like my best friend and I want her to get her happily ever after.
B000002L9Y|5.0|I had this work when it originally came out, but lost it. Now it will be back in my hands. When it first came out I was playing it all the time. Fleetwood Mac is definitely one of the greatest acts ever record music and &#34;grace the stage&#34;! This one does not disappoint.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very interesting and well thought out movie. I would certainly suggest watching this thriller. Very action packed and touching yet harsh as well.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Coldplay, as I do others. This album is another part of the tapestry they weave.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very informative about early onset Alzheimer's.  It was actually a very scary book, even if Alzheimer's doesn't run in one's family.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is it kept me interested long enough to watch the entire movie. I would not watch it again. the graphics were sub-par. the story line was okay more catered to a child. the acting was not the greatest, and the screen play was just enough to keep me watching in semi disgust as well as a sort of interest. i would not say it was a horrible movie defiantly an original. i would say try it for your self and then decide if you like it.
B0063M22QO|3.0|As a fan of 3-D mahjong games, I thought I would give it a try.  It's not all that challenging.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|We are very much in the post Clancy era of Tom Clancy novels here. The characters you know so well are still there though somehow less developed than they used to be. The Ryanverse &#34;history&#34; is still there, though it clashes awkwardly with the post 9/11 world where the Jack Ryan Jr novels are ultimately set.<br /><br />It's clearly largely written by someone else and its certainly not as good as what has gone before it in the series, but on the other hand it is competent enough and I managed to read through it fairly quickly.<br /><br />All in all it's about what you'd expect.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|if you enjoy mob type movies, u don't want to miss this one. i had seen it a long time ago still great second time around
B0063IH60K|4.0|App  works very well on my tablet. Will not allow all options in not connected to WiFi but you still can play a basic game. Placement of cards takes a little getting use too, but otherwise a excellent app.

B00C70FH7M|3.0|Not a bad album at all though I find the similarity of all the tracks to one another a bit of a turn off. I expect more variation in theme and style from a prog band. Maybe next time? I'll certainly give their next album a listen.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was afraid when I bought this book.  At the time, it was the most expensive book I had bought to date for my Kindle but figured I should be okay because there were at the time hundreds of reviews.<br /><br />I have to say The Martian was excellent.  I read it quickly because it kept me coming back for more throughout.  The book is written primarily as the log of an astronaut who is marooned on Mars after a failed mission and what his time, waiting for a rescue, would be like.  The author writes well and give his protagonist a brilliant sense of humor--how else could the term &#34;pirate ninja&#34; be worked into the story?  I have recommended the book to others who have completely agreed and heard them laughing out loud while reading this.  I eagerly await Mr. Weir's next book after reading this one.
B007G6OPAM|3.0|I suggest choosing between the book and the movie because the movie takes enormous liberties that are hard to ignore. Some change is inevitable in an adaptation, but the changes here stray too far from the original. Also, the changes don't add anything of value to the story, rather they detract. The end result is melodramatic and clichéd. It relies on dreariness, hostility, sadness, and various shades of grief (some mildly insane) to create an ambiance, but it misses the mark. Some of the clichés, like the derelict abandoned house, simply don't make sense (Mrs Drablow was living there until very recently; the house might be terribly shabby but it would still be livable). Even if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't rate this film higher. There's worse out there, but this film is neither atmospheric nor scary. It tries too hard when the original story was already very good.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I have the T-Mobile SGN2. I love this app. After the last update the app will not Exit/Close. Tried Menu-Exit-Ok and the app is still open in notifications bar. I have to force close through app manager. Please fix it. It is a grear app. Thanks. For now, it gets 4 stars.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|It doesn't work on my Kindle Fire, you can do the tutor, then it just freezes up.  I've deleted it & tried to reinstall but still doesn't work, put it back in my cloud, I will eventually delete it
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Because I had problems with the ebook format (missing images, strange sentence cuts) and found I disagreed or was uncomfortable with the war metaphor, my initial rating was going to be slightly lower than most - but then I got to thinking more, and realised that this book is not only life-changing, but also changes with life. My life - as I progress in my own understanding of my creative gifts and forces. A few years ago, when first appraching this book, it annoyed me. This time around - ephiphonies obtained. Truly a deserved 5 stars.<br /><br />The forward by Robert McKee pinpoints one particular thing taken from the book - that resistance or fear is in our genes. In the book, this point is only highlighted once, with a term &#34;in the cells&#34; and not dwelled upon. Rather, the book has a lot of points about other things, from professionalism to spiritualism, from war to muses or angels.<br /><br />Yet, McKee picked up on this very minor detail. As I did with other pieces which the author didn't consider big enough to feature as chapters alone. Although there remian large areas in &#34;The War of Art&#34; that seemed contradictory, or incorrect to me, the power of this book is found in the thoughts it provokes when you enter and browse. If you do this - read at your leisure, and are mature enough to interpret it within your own artistic psyche, the book is fabulous -  a resource that should be kept on-hand and top-shelf.<br /><br />It can, as many reviewers suggest, be life-changing, or life affirming, if we were born with a calling to create.
140006922X|3.0|This news article sums up the issues in the text both from the authors claims of degrees, historical and political background and religious understanding.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|A very interesting read, and I can guarantee its nothing like the movie.<br />I am interested to see what Hollywood did with it... although I will probably regret it.<br />With all the zombie hype with \\"The Walking Dead\\", as a society, we really should take a possible global extermination seriously.
