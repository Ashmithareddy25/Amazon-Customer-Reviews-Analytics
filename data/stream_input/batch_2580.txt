B00422LESO|5.0|I was paranoid when I first begin this book; had this author staked me and wrote about me without my knowing?<br /><br />Austenland is a place I wish I could visit. Our heroine is ... 'talked into'... going to a vacation get-away that is set in Regency Era (minus a few errors like electricity). She is trying to have one last &#34;Huzzah!&#34; in allowing herself this guilty pleasure of fictional romance and fictional men before she surrenders to the idea that she does not need a man at all, and focus on much healthier aspect of her life fully.<br /><br />Those who have read Austen's work (or watched all the re-makes of her books to movies) will enjoy the little flavor from each of Austen's novels in here, not only by reference but by subtility as well. I found a little Mr. Knightly, Emma, the Bennett Family (ironically our Herone, Jane, reminded me more of Lydia at times than Elizabeth or her namesake) in characters and in moments. Seeing old favorite characters in new ways makes me wonder if I should pick up some Ausen Fan Fic. Either way, I adored this book.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was AMAZING. At first I was not sure what was going on-everything was happening at once and I didn't like that Percy lost his memory. But then I got into it, and everything was beautifully written and very exciting. This is one of the best books Rick Riordan has ever written!!!!!
B002GMNLKQ|3.0|I. Only have 2 Insomnium. Albums. Their debut and. ACROSS THE DARK. THE Production on the latter is terrible. The vocals are muffled in THE background why is this?  I paid. Good money for this album. I have a kick ass. System so I know it can't. Be my stereo. If I were the band I would be letting someone go. Such a shame for a band so talented I hope the rest of their albums are not like this
B005OYKIJ0|4.0|You must suspend your belief of reality in order to appreciate this movie... Not only for the 'tricks' that are pulled in chases etc but also the acting, mainly Paul walker, who plays 'Paul walker' in every movie he's in.<br />Overall if you like the series you will enjoy this one. The next one is even better. I would rank them like this:<br />1. First (it's the original)<br />2. 6th movie in the series good story line for the series worth watching<br />3. 5th better acting decent story line<br />4. 2nd brought in new characters and clever play<br />5. 4th not memorable but not so horrible it was<br />6. 3rd Tokyo drift is the movie FF fans thought never should have existed. Almost completely tanked the series and to be honest, after reading reviews, I didn't watch it.<br /><br />Bottom line watch the others and make sure to grab this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could hardly finish this book.  It's been said that it is poorly written.  It is.  That's not why I had such a hard time with it though.<br /><br />This 19 year old goes through the entire book exclaiming over every touch, every scent, every moment.  She is a lovesick teenager and acts more like a 15 year old than a 19 year old.  Furthermore, she has little to no self-esteem and runs along behind this sicko like a lovesick puppy.<br /><br />Did I mention, \\"I hated this book.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, he is more than \\"into S&M\\".  This is the epitome of an abusive relationship..  the S*M is simply an addition to the abusiveness.  He wishes to pull her from her family and friends...  he does not \\"allow\\" her to confide in anyone and places her entirely at his mercy.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Being a newcomer to devices I am impressed by the conveniences offered through apps. This app is user friendly and does the job of waking me. I like the weather update especially upon waking to prepare my day. If you can follow instructions settings are easy to do.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|What a fantastic new work from Spock's Beard.<br /><br />This is the best that has come from the band since Neal Morse jumped ship!<br /><br />There is a maturity, depth and restraint that is so wonderful to hear . . . and so rare in the derivative world that is current \\"Progressive rock\\".  One can truly see the benefits of the Enchantment of Spock -- these guys are far wiser together than they were in their previous separate works.<br /><br />Hope this new Spock lives on for many years to come ! ! !
B004GYY714|5.0|Tunein allows me to broaden my listening pleasures and explore. I'd rather do that than watch TV flipping through mindless TV.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|24 is unique in leading &#34;real-time&#34; action in one hour segments that leave you wanting more.  It's a very addictive series, unique in its ability to convey the need to do what it takes, no matter the moral judgments.  Season 8 picked up steam its final 12 episodes with Jack forced to find retribution for the death of a close acquaintence (Renee Walker) by going rogue.  Hour 22 is one of my favorites as Bauer confronts the crooked Charles Logan in a tunnel, taking extreme measures to acquire the intel on the Russians involved in Renee's death.  Compelling storytelling, and Keifer Sutherland really hit it out of the park.  I'm hopeful the mini-series in 2014 will go this bold.

0345803493|5.0|Now this series i loved, loved the read. It was excellent. I am reading it again to make sure i didn't miss anything. The characters were so real. I would have liked to see what happened with the son and daughter they had. That would be interesting. It is a Great, Great read!<br />Can't wait for the next one.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Ok, I will start my review, just saying that if I have listen to this album at least once a day for the past 7 days it means I really digged it. If we talk about production values, it is very clean. The mix is very good and all instrument are clearly listenable. Dave Mustaine's vocals well oh well I think I got used to them by now. Now to the music, hum...It is simple yet so damn catchy you cannot hate it. By no means was I expecting a Rust in Peace or Peace Sells. The beauty of the album is that it is unique in it's own right. Hard Rock driven yes!!! In the end I think that life has taught me to be open minded and give things a chance. Super Collider was one of those records that I truly enjoyed and to some extend as much as when in 1991 I heard Rust in Peace for the first time. I was blown away by songs like The Blackest Crow, Forget to Remember, Burn, Dance in the Rain and Built for War. The album is diverse and offers a bit of everything. Just give it a chance. I must admit Dave Mustaine may have the biggest ego but I think he purpously knew what he was doing when writing Super Collider. He knew what crowd to target. Excellent.
B0027I93U6|5.0|I always heard a lot about this show but never watched it for myself. So happy that I did I love love love this show... Its like no show or movie I've ever seen! And I think Dexter is as cute as a button!! :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I chose to buy the book because of the movie which will air later this year. I was intrigued by the story and decide I was going to read the book. After checking Wikipedia's article on it, and finding out that some people consider it similar to Asimov's Foundation, the purchase was settled.<br /><br />The books is well written, immersible and has an accessible language (English is not my natural language). I liked it so much that I reading it again.<br /><br />I read the book in 3 days, then proceeded to buy the next 3 books (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide and Children of the Mind). In total, I read the 4 books in just 3 weeks.<br /><br />These are the kind of books which makes you eager to read the next chapter, the next book, anything related to it.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for those who like Science Fiction ans Strategy related books. In fact, I recommend the 4 mentioned here (those are the ones I read so far...).
B0040QYROA|5.0|I fell in love with Metropolis when I first saw it in college in the '70s.  I really enjoyed the restored version from Kino I bought in the early 2000s.  But now that I have seen the complete version, the story just makes so much more sense and is so much more satisfying.  The fact that the scenes from the 16mm source are not of the same quality as the rest is incidental.  It might be a problem to watch on a theater screen, but it all works together well on my TV.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fabulous read from start to finish. Wonderful story(stories) of life and love, happiness and sorrow...  Just beautifully written.  I really loved the first two books by Hosseini and worried that this couldn't compare, however, this is probably my favorite.  Please keep writing them!

B004PAHZMC|5.0|My 4 year old grandson LOVES this case.  He loves to keep things organized and clean, and this really made him happy because his mother now lets him bring a lot more Legos when they go visiting others.<br /><br />There are zippers on the sides, and around the top/front.  You can just unzip the top &#34;roof&#34; and use it as the carry case.  It is soft sided and padded.  You can wipe the plastic fabric.  When you are ready for some floor play, you can completely zip it open, and it lays flat.  There are printed designs on the inside of the carry case that look like pieces of property you can build on, and I think there are some roads.  The top part looks like a space theme to me.  I noticed on the FaceTime session my grandson strategically placed his built lego items on the mat.<br /><br />When your child is ready to go home, the playmat zips shut, allowing you to carry it all home.<br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />1. The case is the size of working shoe &#34;shoebox&#34;.  My 4 year old grandson can easily carry it when it is full.<br /><br />2. My 4 year old grandson can unzip it himself, but he has trouble fully zipping it up when it is time to go home.  Mom has to help him.<br /><br />3.  The zippers are very sturdy and do not come unzipped without being pulled.  This is a good thing-- you will not have to worry about losing Legos as you transport them.<br /><br />4.  The handle is very strongly sewed on.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this playmat/Lego box storage combo.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does what it says it will do - calculate. It is intuitive to use and also acts like an adding machine. If you don't remember those, that means that it gives you a tally of each calculation you do so there is no guessing and no mistakes.

B00C7KYXHW|3.0|At first this series had the right mixture of mystery, quirkiness, and, yes, gore.<br /><br />Now it appears intent on shocking for no reason significant to the story line. The characters, who have been developed over the first five or six episodes are taking center stage. The 'murders' are being solved within the first half-hour or so with the rest of the time devoted to further explorations of the angst of the core characters.<br /><br />I liked it better when the core characters were more peripheral to the plot line...
B004TSXUWY|2.0|It is well written and I enjoyed reading, but the story line is weak.  The ending is just such a big let down.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|The \\"Man of Steel\\" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules. It will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film (which is confirmed as a Batman/Superman movie according to news from Comic Con). The standout performances are definitely the two fathers, Costner and Crowe. The fathers, without giving anything away, are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them. Their sequences were powerful and convincing. I almost cried in the movie twice, and they were involved in them both. Their performances were moving.<br />The story itself was the highlight for me. The story fearlessly stepped into religion, humanness, choice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed. There will be many who disagree with the film's presentation of the ideas, even I would disagree in places, but, by dealing with them, they gave the film depth. Also, besides philosophical depth, the movie's plot was gripping from the beginning and, overall, solid. The film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued, using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary. The plot had no real twists, but the plot was not necessarily predictable (I have not read the comics, but the comics could deal with the story. So, comic book fans could be familiar with the plot; I am not sure). The story was compelling, emotional, and relatable. This film ranks, in my opinion, as the best so far this year. The acting, story, and music were all great, giving the Man of Steel a five star return to the big screen.<br /><br />Acting: 4.7<br />Plot: 4.8<br />Overall: 4.74hoice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed.

0142403873|5.0|This book was given to us for my son's 5th birthday.  I had never heard of it before. What a pleasant surprise to open this book and find a fun, clever and entertaining story inside!  We love the book so much we've purchased it here for gifts and for my daughter's daycare.  The story is about a small mouse in the deep dark woods that outsmarts all those who want to eat him.  With rhymes and repetition Ms. Donaldson makes this a story kids can easily repeat along with you as you read.  Clever, clever clever.  I highly recommend.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is so addictive... its a must read. Its a book i have told my friends to read. You wont be disappointed to read..
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|You don't need to watch this movie, because you've seen it before. Bourne Identity, Thief, The Saint - it's basically a plotline/fightscene mashup from your favorite spy action/thrillers. Now, I knew that going in, and I was okay with it (sounded good actually) - but it was just breathtakingly boring. \\"The Whole office is gone!\\" \\"They took his daughter!\\" \\"He has to fight to get here back!\\" \\"He gets revenge!\\" You see it all coming from a mile away. The only reason I didn't turn it off partway through is it would have woken up the girlfriend, and I was enjoying her snoozing on my arm.<br /><br />Three stars because it wasn't *badly* done. I actually thought the lead guy did a good job, although the daughter was annoying. But it sure isn't worth $8 or whatever.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another classic story of politics and espionage by Flynn. Mitch is as tough as ever. The story is fast paced and expertly put together as usual. A great read.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch this movie on television, so the order was for a gift for my sister. It was a totally &#34;dog centered&#34; story, showing the perspective, quite often, from Hachi's perspective. Photographing upwards when he was lying down, for instance, using muted color, showing his singlemindedness as he stood waiting for his master's return on the bus each day. Good family movie, with or without the kids around. Hard to find such a quality of movie nowadays.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book was horrible.  I'm not talking about the ending, it's the writing in general.  Doesn't seem like it was the same author.  The characters were one dimensional, and there wasn't any flow to speak of.  Should have quit while she was ahead.
B00667KMUO|5.0|I put off seeing part 2  of the Harry Potter Series for as long as possible. I just wasn't ready for it to end. But when I saw this disc set that included interviews of the cast and characters I decided it was time. I have not viewed it yet but I am very please with the look,price and delivery of the product. There is a review attached to this particular product on the sellers page. It completely sold me on purchasing the product.

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It's been about fifteen years since I devoured The Eye of the World, so this series has been with me for quite some time.<br /><br />The final installment wrapped up many loose ends, and I found it satisfying.  That said, it wasn't one of the best books of the series.  During previous books, I could sometimes forget I was reading and just get lost in the story.  This time I almost always knew I was reading, because something was just &#34;off&#34; enough to remind me.

193700788X|5.0|I think this book is a great ending to the series.  I am still not sure why many people are upset over how it ended.  I think Charlaine Harris kept true to Sookie's character, and honestly it is the way that I always envisioned it ending.  For all those who have read this entire series, you should understand why this is the way it needed to end.  I think it was appropriate and couldn't really see it any other way.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved this movie. Action packed and the acting was top notch.  Leonardo's character was my favorite but Jamie Fox was true to his last name.  He is hotter than Denzel Washington in this movie.
0525952926|5.0|Great sequel. Waiting for the final book. Follett is a great epic author. Brings history to life for the reader.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I luv this game so much. It's so much fun and addicting. The only thing I don't like is how long the coral and plants take to grow. Otherwise, it's awesome.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Wasn't that great.  I have a severely BiPolar kid, and I wasn't all that impressed with the book.  word word
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Good movie for a lazt Sunday or Saturday. Would recommend this movie to anyone who likes this type of show.
B0045INOCO|4.0|This is a look at the real inner dimensions of our lives. How low man can fall and how choices have to be made regardless if we want to make them or not.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, the movie had most of the parts but the book was able to fill in all the other parts.  I would say the book was better than the movie, more in-depth which I like. All in all I enjoyed the first book! Time for book number 2 & 3
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Was better than I thought it would be. I wish it was longer. It was a great game to play.
0385344228|4.0|Once you start reading this novel, you become so fascinated with the subject that you have to keep reading. I recommend it as I liked it very much. The pace is fast and the characterization excellent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great and fun. If your bored all the time you should get this game play it nonstop is really fun. Get this game and rate it thx!
0547884591|3.0|I only gave this book three stars because I thought it would be all about cooking. Instead I was a little turned off by the authors antidotes and the accelerated teaching methods along with his past experiences. I just want to cook!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is a cute game. Me and my kids set and play it. They love nemo and dory. It's fun and simple. It is also very simple and easy to understand
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was excited about the story when I started, but it drug out. I believe as an author she should have raped it up with the third book. I was really excited about this book, but was kinda disappointed. Is there good  sex?...YES...is she a good writer...YES! The thing is...you really know when it is more about the money than the writing. I was disappointed, but still curious. I will maybe buy the next book to see how it goes.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|This plot had more twists than I am used to in a 'quick read,' but I'm coming to expect more from the Jo Nesbo novels. Nesbo is able to develop sophisticated characters in his stories, who are believable and, in some form or another, attractive. I especially liked Nesbo's ability to integrate historical perspective into modern narratives. In sum, this is an excellent book...
B002RXHW6S|2.0|The bounce house was not as it mentioned. It was very small. It does NOT come with a air pump. You would think it would come with it. Over all, I was very unhappy and I sent it back for a refund. Amazon was great with understanding and they did ship it very fast. Amazon I give a 10 Stars, Bounce House 2 Stars.
0743525043|2.0|I was disappointed with the audio book. I understood it was an abridgment, but when I listened it seemed to be more a recorded interview with the author than an abridgment of the book.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I don't feel it's quite fair to review it since I don't plan to finish the book.  I'm about 3/4 through<br />it and find it very confusing.  The first half was very enjoyable -- then I got lost.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|At the end of the story all of a sudden Jacob is a special education student? Other than that it is a good read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|What an amazing cast of characters.  They rotate in guest stars in opposing council and it keeps things interesting.  Great series with equally great writing.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|excellent, crafty and different novel.  very well done. I almost guarantee the<br />reader will not figure out the villain in advance.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|We were fans of &#34;The Good Wife&#34; during the past 2012-2013 regular season and found watching from the beginning helped us to enjoy and better understand the &#34;Good Wife&#34; character.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The story of Cheryl Strayed and her journey was captivating.  Well told, brutally honest.  Frequently her decisions and actions were frustrating to read, as in &#34;come on, really?&#34; but it was written in a frank and honest manner, which ultimately, proved to be very engaging.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I know a lot of people have bashed Entwined With You because nothing happened and there were loose ends at the conclusion. Because it was supposed to have originally been a trilogy and now there will be 5 books in the series.<br /><br />Guess what people - it happens ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />I'm not disappointed that I get to spend more time with Gideon and Eva. I'm enjoying the development of their relationship and the repairing of their damaged selves. Sure EWY wasn't perfect. It read like a filler book. But, I for one am looking forward to the remaining two books in this series.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I'm almost to the peak of this series and very much look forward to the ride all the way down. I LOVE IT!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. One of the best shows on TV. Highly recommend the show! You will be hooked on the first episode.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|does it sound like disco? sure... does it make you want to dance today? you bet. it doesn't sound like the old daft punk, but that's because it's slightly more groovy, folks!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this because I was asked to by someone who loved not only this story, but all three.  I'm not exactly sure what to think.<br /><br />The author left an ending that in another book would make me panting for the next release, but that's not the case this time around.  It wasn't that the book was bad, yes there were a few things that irritated me...inner goddess needs her own book, but I just couldn't connect with the characters enough to make me want to know what will happen to them.<br /><br />So it wasn't terrible, but it didn't grab me in anyway and I won't continue reading.
B00821OX98|4.0|It comes across as pretty run of the mill Sci-Fi during the first half, but then it does reveal the effort of the shows creator to tell a fairly intricate story. If you find the first few episodes mildly entertaining, the show will grow on you more and more.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This book puts a new spin on the zombie genera, very interesting read and some new ideas. Couldnt put this book down and is now my favourite zombie book!
006114665X|5.0|Prof Christopher Clark has written the best one-volume account of Europe`s stumbling, bumbling descent into war that fateful summer of 1914.  His attention to detail and his exhaustive research are evident on virtually every page.  Whether he is discussing Serbian irredentism, the changing quality of Europe`s geopolitical polarization, or how the various monarchs` behavior prevented clarity in international relations, Prof Clark has read the documents, diaries, and other first-hand source material and presented a very balanced account for today`s readers.  The sheer complexity of the interactions among the various nations during the summer crisis is a valid point of emphasis throughout the book.  That the result was such heartbreaking suffering is a cautionary tale for contemporary world leaders.  Highly recommended.
B00BQXWH2O|2.0|This album wasn't that good like it used to, I like armin van burren's a state of trance series more.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I've assess been a Star Trek TNG fan but the series looked dated and low quality on a modern HDTV. This remastering however is an incredible example of how to do it right - the visuals are now crisp and blu-ray worthy. A treat for any TNG fan and makes the series much more accessible to modern viewers.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good plot and fast paced.  At times too wordy but I survived.  Reading the next one now.  Good start for a new story.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|A very powerful movie full of suspense and heart. Most certainly a must see movie,both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine were excellent choices for a movie like this !!
006114665X|4.0|This could be a college textbook.  The scope of the book and its attention to the entire geopolitics of Europe is meticiously presented.  It is not a quick read, nor one for the casual reader, but it is absolutely fascinating.  Balkan politics, then and now, are incredibly complicated.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|Not so much didn't like the movie, as the process.  I thought this was a rental I could mark and play whenever.  But apparently it was only good for 24 hours and I simply didn't get to watch it.  I couldn't figure out how or where to download it to my iPad.  Need better instructions please. Plan had been to watch during a long day at a treatment facility, but interruptions there made that not possible.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|the one thing I don't like is you have to unlock almost everything but over all I don't love it but I like it
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Great app. Guesses right about ninety nine percent of the time. Just wish it had a feature that would allow you to choose how many questions the genie asks before he guesses. Add this and it will be five stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ever since I was little I always wanted a horse. But now I can have one with this awsome game
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn definitely keeps you guessing throughout this one. Amazing storytelling--not only is it an awesome plot, it sheds light on a lot of interesting observations about today's media and the court of public opinion. Great read-couldn't stop!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a really great game but the scenes are really tiny making the objects extra hard to find. But all in all fun game to entertain yourself or the kids for a while.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I stopped watching Television a long time ago and turned to reading at the end of the day.  BUT, it must be a good book written by some high level writer. Books written by Tom Clance are good reading material, help me relax mentally and sleep well after a while. Jack Ryan, father and son, help with that. I like it and recommend to anyone whi likes reading...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app for horse lovers.  Lots of things to keep busy and interest.<br />Kids like playing the training and taking pictures. Recommend!
0143122916|5.0|Very powerful story, well written, good mix of Shin's personal accounts and the political situation going in in Korea and the world at the time. This is one of those books that will stay on my shelf to be read again instead of dropping in a donation box.
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|I can't imagine how this product keeps being sold.  The image quality is miserable when using it - blurry is a kind word.  I am going to try to return it.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|this was a very good tv series all the actors were very good in this series it should have lasted longer on tv i dont now why it was canceled the bluray 0f rome is great.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The movie inspired me to read the book which gives additional insight into the Michael Oher story.  I gave the book to my 17 year old grandson.  He loved it so much that he stayed up half the night reading it.  Very enlightening....makes you thankful the things we often take for granted.
0812550706|4.0|This story left me with a profound feeling of wow as I finished. It asks the question... What would you do if your civilization was threatened with impending annihilation? The problem is solved in Ender's Game by recruiting children to fight their war. The story follows one such boy (Ender) as he is thrown into a child military. Expect a story packed with high emotion and lots of action.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have seen Josh in person 3 times. He has the profoundly moving tonality in his voice that evokes emotion!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Gideon and Eva are growing closer in this book. It was tough to put down at times. The end of this book doesn't have me itching to buy the next one like the others did though.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|It's really unfair to compare this movie to THE WIZARD OF OZ, a classic that is incomparable.  While obviously a prequel, Sam Raimi has fashioned what's really a tribute to the original.  On its own, OZ is a engagingly enjoyable fantasy, visually impressive with delightful humor and a great set of characters.  James Franco avoids the Depp/Downey approach and offers a less ostentatious Oz that I found refreshing.  Michelle Williams is a glowing Glenda, a sharp contrast to the wicked pair of Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis, who are delightfully evil.  No one will ever outshine Margaret Hamilton but Kunis holds her own.<br />OZ is big, blustery and overblown but I had a grand time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoying all of the episodes.The acting is superb and I look forward to watching the next season as soon as possible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I didn't need to look up solutions.  I enjoyed playing this game but sure hope they add more levels soon.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|This was the typical movie where they give you despicable villains and then kill them off in what they hope will be a gratifying way. This formula works for so many people, most of the time. However, this movie didn't really work too hard to be realistic. It was actually more &#34;campy&#34; with bodies exploding like they were sacks of ketchup. That kept it from being too offensive, however it wasn't that great a story either.<br /><br />I was moderately entertained hen I wasn't cringing, but I felt the customer reviews built it up too much, and as a result it didn't meet expectations. If you LOVE the actors, or Quentin Tarantino, you will like it. I doubt you will love it though.
B009LMTDL0|1.0|I just can't finish reading this book! Too boring and is totally common sense what she talks about! Why did I buy this? Oh yes, an idiot recommended me. I should have known better!
B007ZYJT1U|1.0|This sounded interesting, but after watching five minutes where the character was just brutal to his dog, I turned it off. I still can't get that image out of my head. (chanting...&#34;Its just a movie, its just a movie...&#34;)
B00C4QVRAK|5.0|This is possibly Julia Roberts best movie ever. The classic Cinderella story, told for a more modern time. It is definitely a must see.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Feel-good in every way, witty comedy and cute romance. Overall a well made and thoroughly enjoyable movie. The most interesting post-apocoliptic zombie flick I have yet to see. Loved every second of it!
B005LAIGZU|1.0|If you're an avid movie collector like myself and actually care about getting the slip covers with your movies, don't purchase this. The picture shows the product with one, but not only did it come without the cover, but the artwork was torn underneath the plastic. Not worth it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. Best one I have read in a while. One of those where you sob and wish you could change the story, but you know if you did, it wouldn't have been as good. Highly recommend the read!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner made me a Hosseini fan.  And the Mountains Echoed did not disappoint.  The most captivating aspect of these novels is that the reader is taken not just TO Afghanistan, but INTO Afghanistan and allowed a view beyond war, into the personal lives of a people we would not otherwise know.  Lovely.
B00AAIHAGO|5.0|Rented this on pay per view.  My wife had never seen it and it was as awesome as ever.  Great film, great actors, great piece of history that brings back a lot of memories.
B008602KQI|3.0|Couldn't compare to the book. Slow to start. Poorly explained. Characters match well enough. Katniss appears well-fed and Gayle looks about 35. If you love the series it's worth seeing. Showed it to my 7th graders. Not very violent but they do drop 'damn' and 'hell' more than once.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's an awesome, amazing game. There's a lot of new cool stuff. It's one of my very favorite games. Even my older brother likes it.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|it so fun like recomend this app 5 star toatly I mean who would not want it. I love this appease
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Unlike other covers I've had for my regular Kindle this one does not slip off the Kindle Fire.  It's good protection and attractive.  My only complaint is that it doesn't usually stay sitting upright when you try to use the stand.  It might stay there if you don't touch the Kindle but that's obviously impossible.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I have been a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's since the Shopaholic series, but found that many of her books after that series didn't quite hit the mark.  I think this one has been the best since Shopaholic.<br /><br />I like reading her books because they are funny and light-hearted and a real escape.  Her main character is always cheeky and fun.  In this one, it's no different.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something that is mindless and just enjoyable.  It's a great Summer read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What can happen when you're in foster care and when you age out?  This story may not be that realistic but it gives you some idea of that- and what can happen with resourcefulness.  I routed for her all the way/
0380730405|5.0|Received the book quickly. It is in perfect shape, looks brand new. It is a nice quality as to paper and binding. The book is a great read.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is good but it's kind of getting a little bit boring. It's almost as fun as subway surfers.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|delightfully fun! very pretty! simple concept - basically you just complete each task. when you complete tasks you get rewards like algae which you can feed to your fish,  and sand dollars which you can use to buy different types of corals, rock formations,  and seaweeds.  The more diverse you reef is the healthier it is,  allowing you to level up faster. Cute fish,  bright colors, with lots of choices to make your reef beautiful and unique. you can also visit friend's reefs to complete tasks and earn points. Farmville of the fish world.
B006S08RLU|5.0|If you're apprehensive about the subtitles, don't be - after a while, you forget you are reading them and you are amazed by the sweet, caring, beautiful Amelie.  I have wanted to see this movie for a few years, but was scared off by the subtitles - now I am absolutely kicking myself because this movie has become one of my all time faves!  The Blu Ray version is even more fabulous - I have noticed details in the wonderful scenery and Amelie's unique facial expressions that I did not see in the standard version.  This movie will make you smile....I just love it!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I read this book for exactly what it is-a well done series with all the twists and turns you would want in a book from Lee Child. I will read every single one until Lee Child stops writing them.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I did not think this movie would be so interesting. I love it...I hope they gonna have one more soon.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I didn't know where this one was taking me, but I loved the entire trip!  If you like old mysteries, this is a must.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great convenience.  You can carry an entire library in the palm of your hand.  And, you can make the type as small or as large as you like.
B00B2EWNWG|3.0|If you like throw back kung fu, you'll enjoy it, but like throw back kung fu, just a little will be enough
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It's dark and you never know where it's going to lead you. I like a book that surprises me and is nothing like what I've read before and this book is just that.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|This was one of the better animated flims that I have seen, it was entertaining, and the art work was great.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep until someone told me about White Noise! Not anymore. This is a great app.<br />I wish. I'd found it sooner.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|OMG... THIS OMD CD is OTH..... i always did love the OMD sound; but let me tell you ; this CD is a must for ANYONE, not just OMD FANS; its like they didnt miss a beat at all.. i dont really know if they continued recording since &#34;back then in the 80's&#34;; but the songs are great... very OMD, but totally modern... its like the whole CD &#34;TAKES  YOU BACK... BUT AT THE SAME TIME TAKES YOU INTO THE FUTURE&#34;....<br />ABSOLUTELY A MUST HAVE.... love it
B002YVAT72|1.0|was excited to buy for my husband for his birthday.  After trying to download an lp to itunes numerous times, without success, contacted customer support.  we were told that this turntable is no longer compatible with the updated version of itunes!  what a disappointment.  They are trying to work on a solution,and are not sure when that will be?  and will itunes update again in the meantime...?  we are returning this item as we were not able to transfer to itunes as described....
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Hurricane season is here. Lanterns are better than flashlights! They make great gifts for kids and grandkids. One for every nroom is perfect.
B00B4804KS|4.0|Although a movie filmed in 3D is much better than one converted they did a good job and the result is great. Would love to see this done for some other older great movies.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was truly disappointed In this book after waiting so long....I expected some excitement just like the first and second book, the love and romance was there but. It wasn't, exciting.  There was something missing...I would've loved to know more about Gideon past,about his dreams/nightmares. What are those about???  This sequel was such a let down.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is very fun.  High quality game, good graphics, cute gameplay.  Be prepared to kill a lot of time with it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozed is a great game. It's very fun and excite and will keep u busy for hours. Try it and rate it.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|I have read several of Bryson's books.  His homey and self deprecating essays are invariably fun to read.  It is hard for me to read his books and not say, &#34;Yeah, that's me...&#34;<br /><br />This book is a bit dated having been published at Y2K, but the writing is still pleasing and relaxing.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I attached to my City Mini as soon as it arrived & haven't removed it since! I can open & close it without it getting in the way and it holds my refillable water cup, my daughter's Avent bottle and anything else I can pack in it like my phone, keys and my 7yr old's small Sunny Delight bottle.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love this game but the full version is way better.if you do not have the full version you should get it.the full version is way better than demo.I have two reasons this game is better than mincraft. #1 survialcraft cost less than mincraft. #2 survivalcraft has more items there invatorey.so I give survivalcraft demo 4stars but the full version 5stars.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love this show. It is made in a  way that everyone can enjoy it. I definitely recommend this series.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I don't normally leave reviews of apps because very few really impress me.  This app, however, is one of the best apps I've picked up for any of my devices.  I saw it when it was a FAOTD and thought I would take a shot.  Now, I would pay much more than $9.99 for it because of the features, speed and ease of the program.  This beats programs like LogMeIn so badly it's like they're Glass Joe and you're Piston Hurricane (if you get that PunchOut! reference).<br /><br />If you need/want remote desktop access on your Android device, you can NOT go wrong with Jump.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Girlfriend is in love with this album and so am I.  He has a voice that you can not say enough about.  Will be buying more of his music.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|i lost mine that came with kindle so I ordered this one.  It works wonderfully.  No probs at all!  i would recommend.
030758836X|2.0|This book didn't begin to hold my interest until page 140! The reason I continued up until then was because of the hype I had heard about it.  It did sway your emotions. It was easy to follow. I disliked the ending but maybe that's a good thing!<br />I just can't see why it became such a hit.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|Time paradoxes, other people, the development of skynet, John Conner's decisions to use terminators himself, the different life form that is the T-1000 etc that no one ever develops much past the original limited 1984 story line, and that is really disappointing.  Just another shoot-em-up, and not a really good one at that.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked the style of this author, telling about young people with cancer from their point of view.  The teenage voice allowed the book to be more lighthearted on a sad subject.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Normally I hate these types of things where they &#34;reboot&#34; the series.  But this movie was great, action pack, and still geeky enough to be a Trek movie
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great CD...Enough said!!  Love it...Except the last song on this CD is Christmas!!  Other than that, 5 stars.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|He is neither in the book nor the Silmarillion.  There is a reason why the Hobbit was great to being with.  Peter Jackson you do not have to create your own story it was already great.  That is unless you are a greedy pig and want to stretch out a 270 into 3 money sinks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Delighted they've continued the series. It's beautifully down and remains interesting! We can watch it as a family which makes it wonderful!
B0094K20FK|5.0|Just Classic.  You should watch the old ones to get familiar with references made in the new ones.<br /><br />2 more words required
B007SNMYNS|2.0|There is no clinical research cited to support the claims made. wheat is not the only product we eat that has been genetically modified. The sample size cited is too small o be meaninful.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|Normally I hate these types of things where they &#34;reboot&#34; the series.  But this movie was great, action pack, and still geeky enough to be a Trek movie.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I recently found my way back to the bedside of a former teacher - thankfully, she was just recovering from surgery. tuesdays with Morrie reminds us of the gift it is to reconnect with the signifcant people in our lives.
B000O76TA4|5.0|For my boyfriend's birthday, I had the hardest time finding this item anywhere. Frantic with no gift two days before his birthday I turned here to Amazon and found this gem. The service I received was amazing. The overnight shipping came so fast, buying the item that gently used almost felt like a steal because of how pristine it was. My guy hates money spent on him, but there is no way he would ever go without this now :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|great movie , hope they make a second one :) Love the bow action lol hope the original casters are in the next movie
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazam Is An Amazing App That Can Recognize Any Video, Movie, or Song Just From The Sounds In It!! AWESOME
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for and it arrived right when they said it would and was the perfect accessory for my kindle.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I think the story lines are well witten. The casting is unexpected but works real well.There areparallels to the old Holmes which ties it up neatly. I would recommend this series as one to watch.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|The story telling method used within the novel is phenomenal and parallels that only of major scripture in style and form. The use of animal influence to represent the essence of the struggle of Pi leaves the reader anxious and open to alternate perspectives of the world. I tremendous read of beautiful diction. A perfect read for any existential struggles.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I never thought I would see the greatest band of all time in such stunning video quality. This concert showcases some of their greatest songs. If you love the studio versions of Led Zep songs you will love their live renditions twice as much. They add so much live! This blu ray is a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Good game after tutorial gets fun can't get too far having to buy cards other than that I can play this game all day
B000026OHN|5.0|Richter's interpretation of the Bach Preludes and Fugues is at the opposite pole from that of Glen Gould.  Gould's priorities, it seems to me, and I am no expert, were to articulate each voice clearly, to create the definitive demonstration of the most glorious polyphonic music.  And he succeeds.<br />Richter often omits to bring out the lower voices and submerges the polyphony.  Notwithstanding that, his recording is supremely expressive, joyous, and profound, done with wonderful coloring.  All of that and sometimes played faster than I can follow.  I love it.<br />People who want perfect up-to-date sound may have to look elsewhere.  But I am hooked on this and play it over and over.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Loved this item, the bag is real strong and sturdy, with plenty of compartments and pockets, that can move....using velcro. there is also space to put a tripod for carrying around. although a bit bigger than i originally thought, the product has a nice feel, very cushiony, protects the camera and accessories very good. the price is not too bad also. will recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a camera backpack
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another gem of perfection by Kahlid Hosseini.  Every character in this novel is fully drawn and it is easy to care about their life story.  I will read anything Mr. Hosseini writes and eagerly await his next novel.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|There isn't much from the original pulled into this series. It is 6 years after the original has ended; rich people (not related to the Bellamys) reinstate the house which is found in shambles; servants are hired for downstairs as rich folk begin to populate upstairs. One common thread: Rose, the ladies maid/housekeeper from the original series, returns as a woman running a business providing servants employment (then moves into the mansion as head servant). So it doesn't work to compare. On its own, this series is good, but it ain't no Downton Abbey.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I use  Skitch both on  my phone and on my PC  it is great for capturing  sites, pics , and marking them up and sending them to others.  Works  great for photos at work also.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Informative and accurate. Plan outings and trips based on daily forecasts for select locations.  Tends to be a favorite app for the family. Works extremely well on cell phones, Kindle fires and other devices.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am all ways writing myself notes  and loosing them.  Well  I found  the answer  to my problem  all my notes in one  app  and  the sampe app on  three pcs and two  phones.  Now I don't forget  almost everything.
B000002GYG|5.0|Although this is a studio album, it was recorded before a live audience.  The interaction between Waits and the audience makes this CD pop.  Waits is witty, not wierd, in this 30 some odd year old recording, unlike his current music.  Superb musicianship, funnybone-tickling and heartstring-plucking lyrics, and the vibe of late Saturday night at a hipster L.A. jazz club make this one of my all-time favorite albums.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I got a new phone so  I added this app  to go with my PC  site.  Facebook is a  love hate  relationship  I enjoy the  contacts  but hate the garbage  and  there is  no  way  to  unlike  a  site.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly I had never heard of The Hunger Games until it came out as a movie.  I'm in my 40's I'm not exactly in the demographics for this book.  Recently I caught the movie on Netflix and really enjoyed it.  Figured the book had to have more information about everything (books are always better than the movie) - so I picked the book up (well rented it on my Kindle Fire).  AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I had seen the movie, I knew actually how it ended, but I was so totally enthralled with the story.  It is a very interesting and very well written story.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to start reading the second book.  In fact, I just started reading the second book yesterday.  I sat and read for 7 hours last night.  I only stopped because it was 1:30 a.m. and I had to work today.  I am glad that I saw the movie first to put some of the descriptions of the people in The Capital in perspective, but not really necessary.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The Tenth Doctor will always be our favorite so obviously we had to have his sonic screwdriver.  It was a great find!
B00B19DW0E|4.0|I watched this movie when it came to the big screen years ago and never forgot it.  Picked it up from Amazon when I saw it on line and it brought back lots of good memories.  Great cast, great director, and some unforgettable characters.  Check it out for a fun time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved this entire series, watched in on my Kindle, wonderful sound and video, would recommend it to anyone, wonderful value
030758836X|3.0|\\"The wrap up (very important to fans of the mystery genre) is almost non-existent. This was one of those books you can't put down, a real age-turner, until you read the last page and say, \\"that's it?\\". Now I feel like I wasted my time.\\"  Exactly - said very perfectly.  The ending killed this book, which i was enjoying up until the last page which left me wondeirng where the rest of the pages were.  (I literally kept hitting the forward button on Kindle!).  Because of this, i cann't recommend this book (which up to that point I would have) because it makes everything else, everything you felt, moot.
B003UYUP58|5.0|A great book for anyone interested in the medical profession.  Biomedical history lesson written in a way that really grabs you.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|Regardless of what people say I think Tom Cruise is a cool actor and is almost always in cool movies.<br />Oblivion is no exception. Add him to the amazing visuals of this movie, a cool (kind of unique) story, and Morgan Freeman (can you go wrong with Mr. Freeman?), and incredible soundtrack and you can't lose.<br /><br />One thing I try to avoid is reviews, especially from critics. They're called critics because they find the fault in almost everything they \\"review\\"... just remember, those that can't act/direct/produce, critique. ;)
B007EDZ20O|5.0|Mother Teresa is revealed as a cunning, less than holy fundraiser. She failed to ensure the comfort of those dying in pain.<br /> She told them their pain meant that  &#34;Jesus&#34; was &#34;kissing them&#34;.<br /> Surely, Jesus would have gone to the drug cupboard and administered analgesics which were well-funded by donors world-wide.<br /> Well done, Christopher Hitchens : showing up yet another hypocrite held in world-wide esteem!
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|But if I have to get a new Black Sabbath CD without Bill Ward, this is the one I want.  It's everything I could have wanted from some old school Sabbath!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's an easy read. Good book. A whole lot darker than the movie especially the character, Pat Sr.<br /><br />Overall, it's entertaining and gives more background and insight to the characters like Tiffany.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|An excellent book, holds your attention with an ever evolving, scary plot. Also, educational on the history of the Masonic order in the United States.
B005LAII0I|5.0|This is a great family-friendly movie.  We watched it with our kids, and it is now our 10 year old daughter's favorite movie.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|My daughter was very pleased! It got here very fast too.she loves Kelly clarkson and continually listens to it! Really!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Love the quality and there's nothing like the original series!<br />Amazon prime rocks!Would love to see more titles like this.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Absolutely the most brilliant show I have ever seen! I love the writers, the casting is right on! Jessica Lang! OMG! I cant find the right words that would describe her amazing talent! Can't wait for season 3!!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I was disappointed.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped.  A lot of Disney movies of the past have been great to watch over and over for both adults and children, but this one wasn't that great for either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ever since the new update came out, now I can make cake, buckets, and other epic stuff. Can't wait for a Redstone update! I wish that Realms wasn't always full, though...

B003K15IF8|4.0|Williams' novel has recently been rescued from undeserved obscurity. It rivals the best 'academia' novels, but goes far, far beyond.
B000067J1H|5.0|It's just freakin awesome. All the rules of fight club explain the entire movie. haha Gotta love it so much.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I have watched it from the start and it just keeps getting better. If you are looking for something that is a little sweet, with great characters, that makes you laugh out loud alot this is it.
B002E01LL6|5.0|Love this movie. It's freakin badass. All of it including Channing Tatum. He is freakin pretty ripped in this movie and beats ass.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|A lot of people will bemoan the lack of action but this really does stand out as good Trek. While some of th elements do not hold up well to the test of time (some of the uniforms are just plain awful) the concepts and ideas are just as intriguing today as they were when this was made.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I love this album very much. Love every song on it along with the beats and everything. I don't care what people say about Justin Bieber. I Like this music produced by him and everyone who has handed him the lyrics and beats for his music. Atleast this sort of music exists and is more positive that a lot of music out there. I think most people are just very jealous of him. Nobody even truly knows him, you can't hate someone that you don't even know.  Doesn't even make sense.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Its pretty good.  I would say 4.5 stars and its great that Demi is still doing ok.  I know she has had some rough spots in her life.<br /><br />Anyway, back to listening to the cd.
B00192IV0O|5.0|My fiancé and I dedicated this entire album to us a long long time ago and it still is just all amazing music. Used to bump around in my Jeep with my subs all the time :]

B00991TCOG|5.0|Violinist :] She is so amazing at the violin it's insane! I love all the music. Have listened to the album atleast 200 times I think haha.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Love the Sherlock Holmes movie, a great watch. The movie came in great condition. It was like new, the case and CD were perfectly intact. Will buy again.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|SoundCloud is amazing and I love be able to access my favorites on my Kindle.  Sometimes soundcloud acts up on my computer but I have never had problems on my Kindle.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Watched the first season, and fell in love. This season is a little different, not as good as the first. Definitely worth watching, though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game to waste time with. Lots of fun trying to collect prizes and coins. I play this game everyday.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|The acting was good.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in the movie were unnecessarily dark.<br /><br />Although I'm sure historically accurate, the amount of bad language and blood could have been reduced.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|loved the original movie, this one was quite slow and dark. Had a lot of promise, but it was so slow and mediocre acting, i turned it off
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Cohen has talent, but as usual he descends into the moral abyss with sex, &#34;F&#34; words and racism jokes. I guess that is who he is. But  like him as king Julian.
0679805273|2.0|Great book, but product came water damaged :(  I was planning on giving it as a keepsake, but I defintiely can't give this to anyone!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Felt like an accurate portrayal of the time period. Very violent, but a must watch for Tarentino fans. Jamie Foxx was excellent!
B002N14GPE|4.0|It's a scary movie, with scares, all types. You really can't go wrong with this movie if you are looking for horror.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgis Clark has done it again with another spellbinding mystery. Another can't put it down book. I would recommend this to anyone enjoying a good mystery.
B009R659L8|5.0|It's great, keeps up the thrill till the end. I wasn't able to put it down. Can't wait to read the next one.
0425263924|5.0|Book is great - but the ending.....serioulsy more teasers - the book should have been over 500 pages to finish  the story.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I like the format of this app - flipping through pages like you are reading a book is nice.  However, the app really fails when it comes to viewing a Twitter feed.  For some reason, you cannot see the entire text of each message.  Even if you select a single message to bring it up full screen, it still only shows a few words, followed by an ellipse (...).  If they could fix that, it would be 5 stars.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|I had been looking forward to it since I first heard that Quentin Tarantino was working on a western genre project.  I am a big fan of westerns and of most of Tarantino's movies too so this seemed to me like a \\"can't miss\\".  It's not really a miss it's just a bit too long for it's own good.  As a matter of fact I watched the first hour of Django Unchained with a HUGE smile on my face and thinking that this is the best western film in probably 20 years.  As in most of Tarantino's movies the '70's cinema influence is obvious and actually works in the film's favor.  The first hour plays a little like a harder edged version of The Skin Game -1971-(James Garner and Lou Gossett Jr- if you haven't seen it check it out).  Beautiful cinematography, clever dialogue, and exciting characters kept my eyes on the screen for every frame.  Then the story lands in one location: Candieland, the plantation owned by Leonardo DeCaprio's character Calvin Candie.  He has become the owner of Django's wife and Django (Jamie Foxx) has come there with his new mentor, and rescuer from bondage, bounty Hunter Dr. King Schulz (brilliantly played by Christoph Waltz) to free her.  At this point it's still a great film but I think a little too much time was spent on this section of the film.  The second half of the second act seems like filler to me.  We could have gotten to the point a little faster and not lost any of the story.  The third act has a classic, if not a bit cliche by now, Tarantino bloodbath resolution.  Django Unchained has a running time of 2 hours 45 minutes and does suffer a bit from excessive length.  It's a brilliant first act, followed by a flawed second act, ending with a cliched but pretty cool third act.  I like this film but when I watch it again in the future it will probably be in two sittings.  I have a feeling it will play better in two parts, much like the overly padded Kill Bill did.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Very entertaining.  Great actors . Some things are numerous yet serious at the same time. Even my husband got hooked on watching!
B004J64QSI|5.0|I saw this on YouTube and I was crying at the end.mu had to have this for my collection to enjoy whenever I wanted.
0517543052|4.0|I remember reading this in the early '70's&#34;.  Of course not of original paper stock.  In good condition as a reprint.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|this thing is diesel.  you can pry open elevator doors with this thing.  i used it to carve me up a bad ass spear.  this tool is a weapon that makes weapons.  it kind of feels like it will outlast this world, like it is from planet krypton.  you will need to sharpen it and the carbon will scuff.  i am lefty and switched the sheath around so i could wear it lefty on my utility belt.  this is heavy so you need a hefty belt if you are going to wear it on the waist.  nice thumb notch pops the knife out of the sheath lock.  doesn't come with a wrist band / loop but you can add one on the handle.  the knife butt can be used to bash things.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|My life changed after reading Bared to You. Yes, it is that good a book. Reflected came after and it was a solid segway. Entwined? Entwined is just fluff. It's all over the place. I am seriously considering just dropping this series and Sylvia Day altogether. I feel defrauded. There are so many great independent authors that I can read instead and be completely fulfilled for a fraction of the price that I am just not interested anymore in SD's marketing products. Very, very disappointing...
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A really fascinating and captivating concept for a storyline.  This was a great vacation/summertime read.  Been a while since I've stayed up to read.  I highly recommend this book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Love the story, couldn't put it down. Good story line and great characters. Some parts could have used more detail but overall a really good story.
B004WR125O|2.0|So I purchased this item in the hopes that I would have a way to stream all sorts of music, have a simple way to update my firmware, etc., all through the magic of wireless internet.  Call me lazy, I just didn't want to run a network cable from my router in my office, through the attic, down to the receiver in my living room so I thought this would be a very useful device.<br />To my folly, I purchased it without reading any reviews or instructions on how it worked; I assumed it would be like any of my other wireless devices, phone, laptop, XBox, etc.  When I connected the UWF-1 to my TX NR609 it started working as designed, it launched the installation and setup menu and I went to work.  I tried to find the device via my router and was unable to connect, I tried to find the device manually and my network was nowhere to be seen which is by design, as an added layer of security to my home network, I don't broadcast my SSID.  This has always been a pain for anyone trying to connect to my network mainly because they can't \\"see\\" it in their list of available networks let alone the fact they need a password to access it.  Anyway, with ANY of my other wireless devices, there will be a way to search for a hidden SSID, however with the UWF-1 and my 609 receiver, there is no such option.  I thought the product was faulty but my neighbors wireless networks were visible.  I changed the settings on  my router to broadcast my SSID and once my network was visible I connected to it without any issue.  The connection was great and I was able to see all the cool streaming apps (no netflix or Hulu? WTF?).  Well now that I had the internets on my receiver I decided to hide my SSID again through my router and once I did that, the connection between my receiver and router was gone!  I was dumbfounded that this $25 device combined with my $500+ receiver is not smart enough to remember a network that has its name hidden.  I finally did some research and it turns out that this is a commoncomplaint and that Onkyo is not doing anything to fix the issue.  I am currently in the process of repackaging the UWF-1 and returning it; my sense of internet security means more to me than having access to a few mediocre apps at my finger tips that I can stream through my TV or Blu-ray if need be.  For my firmware updates...time to break out the 300 footer network cable and do it the old school way.<br />I gave this two stars instead of one because it does what it is supposed to do.  I only gave it two stars because it does this job rather poorly...now this might be in combination with my receiver that it only does a poor job but either way it is not worth it to me to sacrifice my internet security.  I blame myself for not doing some research on the UWF-1, had I done so I would never have purchased it.<br /><br />I hope that this is helpful to at least someone.<br /><br />KG
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Great condition. great arrival time. all around great product! I love this movie and was so excited when i got i. I would advise anyone to use this seller
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I would have given this seller all 5 stars if the blu-ray box was not damaged.  I'm not talking about the shipping box, I am talking about the cover box the blu-ray comes with.  It was ripped on the front and back.  If the description said that it was damaged, I would not have bought it.  I would have went somewhere else.  I like the cover boxes to be in tact.<br /><br />Other than that, the item came on time and the actual disc was not damaged.  Thanks.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good show, plot line seems a bit repetitive. Would help to have the character be built a bit more in each episode.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Book starts out slow but really gets your attention more than halfway through......the action kept my eyes glued to the book for the last 10 chapters
B00499NHLC|5.0|Seldom do you find such well-drawn three-dimensional characters and rich story lines in a television series. But &#34;Sherlock&#34; delivers consistently, one episode after another. From the first installment, poor John Watson is drawn into Holmes's lifestyle and maze-like mind and begins to realize his own life will never be the same. Gradually, viewers understand the same is true for them. After the first thirty minutes, you will develop an appetite for the tempo, the graphic, the style of discernment of each case, scene, and mystery. If you are a fan of puzzles, suspense, and wit, don't miss this gem of a series.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I feel like Silvia Day could not think of anything to write and she just through this together. I loved the first two books however this one is soooooooooo disappointing. I also thought this was supposed to be a trilogy. I think Silvia Day needs to get her life together and go back to the mentality she had for the first two books because now I don't know if I want to read anything else she puts out. I give this book a negative star.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is awesome m e earning gems is easy you just have to level up it is awesome!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|this is an amazing jewel-matching game. the graphics and animations are great, the music is good and it's straight forward on usability.<br /><br />there are a lot of unique ways this game can be played, which makes it more challenging but also a lot more fun. the 'hint' button also comes in handy when it gets harder.<br />there are 7 levels, each with a few sub-levels. it takes a long tune to beat all the levels, plus trying to get perfect scores adds to play time. each level has a bonus round as well. for $2, you'll definitely get your money's worth. great game.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|From the very first page, I could not put this book down.  I loved how honest Cheryl was about herself.  It's going to take me awhile to fully digest everything.  I will think about all the characters for a long time and wonder where they are now and what are they doing.<br /><br />Susan Heinrich<br />Portland, Or

1400067820|5.0|A very wise and provocative book, must reading for anyone involved in leadership and improvement roles in organizations or communities
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Very well done. Gerard Butler does a great job as the phantom. Have seen númerus times. And will see again.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is great music with exciting rhythms and expressive lyrics. Simon and Garfunkel fans should beware as Paul Simon obviously moved on.  This is old news.  But this is still wonderful music.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|For some of the well known actors in this film, it could have been better. There were Some funny moments, but other than that it was just ok.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I am an avid competitive swimmer...  who, when not in my office, can most frequently be found in the pool.  While I do swim with a team, I often supplement formal swim practice with additional pool time on my own...., and have been known to spend a good three - four hours in the water just swimming.  When I do this, I love to have music playing as it helps me to keep my tempo and rhythm with each stroke and kick.  One of the clear benefits of the Finis Neptune Underwater MP3 Player is that I can load A TON of music onto the device, and connect it effortlessly to my goggle straps. I love that there aren't conventional earphones (I hate having anything in my ears as I swim), and really enjoy the bone conducting \\"head phones\\" that allow me to hear my music clearly underwater, while still hearing people talking on deck when I stop at the wall.  An added benefit of the bone conducting head phones is that I can adjust the music (volume and songs) without taking the device off my head.<br /><br />If put on properly, the Finis Neptune Underwater MP3 Player stays on ...  while butterflying, flip turning, and sprinting.  It's an AMAZING product that I would recommend above any and all other underwater MP3 players on the market.  If you want the very best device at a really reasonable price, I recommend the FINIS NEPTUNE UNDERWATER MP3 PLAYER!  You can't go wrong![[ASIN:B00ACP3OOM FINIS Neptune Underwater MP3 Player]]
B00957T6X6|4.0|Got hooked on the HBO show, the book gives a lot more details that help understand the story much better.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I first saw the movie by the same name and was so intrigued with Chris's story that I immediately ordered the book, and so glad I did.  Mr. Krakauer does an excellent job of retracing Chris's steps along with an in depth look at his family and formative years.  What a fascinating study of human behavior ... And my heart goes out to the McClandess family for such a tragic loss.  A must read ...
B00005OOQ5|4.0|If you can't afford a live performance or can't travel to see this is a good alternative, especially if you have a wide screen and/or HD TV.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|It's an awesome album.  The only thing I dislike is I bought their EP and now they have the same 5 songs on this album too, although one of them is a different version.  I already listened to those songs over and over and over so I find myself skipping those songs more often than not.  But that is not enough to make me rate it lower than 5 stars!  I haven't stopping listening to it since it was released!
0142410373|4.0|Hard to get kids to read now when books are not as exciting as video games to kids.  Amazon is always such a help in finding age appropriate books for my grandkids on subjects to grab their attention.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great continuation of the \\"Crossfire\\" story.<br />I actually grew closer to Eva and Gideon in this book. Gideon opened up some and became a better partner to Eva while Eva seemed to get stronger for them both.<br />Poor Cary, hopefully he gets his s*** straightened out. Can't help but love him, though. Looking forward to the next book, hopefully not too far off.<br />Thanks, Sylvia, for a great story!!
1423140591|4.0|My 13 year old grandson has aspbergers and it's hard to get him to read.  After Harry Potter I was looking for something to hold his attention and Rick Riordan's books certainly do.  This is his current series and as soon as he's done with one book he asks for the next.  His mandatory 30 min. read before bed has turned into 60 without him realizing it and we are thrilled.  The books are full of action without the need to sensor read for his age before he reads.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|The writing is exquisite.....the story..........not so much. Completely improbable situations were dragged out and reiterated to death. It was slow and confusing at first, but then I was sucked it to both the characters and the story, until the characters got weirder and weirder and the story went no-where. A whole lot of hype for a flat ending.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Difficult to control.  Layout is very small - not much to do.  Not really worth the money - played it a couple of times and done.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Quirky over acting... Interesting for legal tv buffs or law school students delusional about what they think their legal practice will be like.<br /><br />The pilot's in court scene was wholly incapable of happening in real life... That goes about for the rest of the drama occuring in the firm on the show.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|What can I say Megadeth always gives you something good. The music is fresh and something new from a long time favorite of mine. Thanks guys and keep putting out kick a.. music!!
B00CY1JUW2|3.0|it has a few gems but I like when they rock hard ...this is mellow to me...not enough punch ...
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Such a pleasure to listen to someone so unbelievably talented and yet humble.  Great duet with Eric Clapton.  The word needs to get out about this guy.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Everyone should watch this and the new one too. Great acting, great humor, great cast. Its everything you look for in a comedy
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Thank God its over...OK i agree i read all three but that's because i don't leave anything incomplete. But really, there was no need for 3 books...it could all be just summed up in one...if the bedroom scene between Ana and Grey was not written over and over and was just added to the appendix with the some notes. It was the same thing over and over and over....i love reading hot stuff but it was so monotonous that i skipped pages every time they started kissing...Worst part is its all so crappy, Ana is trying to be judgmental about Grey but how is she any different. she is a sex maniac who enjoys BDSM, only as long as it doesn't hurt her. Anyways, it was sad reading it...really E.L James has a lot of patience to write a novel like this :( trilogy really?
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this show is was great acting and the set was beautiful, and they made sure that in the end it answered everything its to bad the show ended
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The writing is beautiful but i am little disappointed by the role of the Katniss in the war...I thought she would be by now smart enough to understand what was happening and expected that glorious big shot moment but I guess that's just my \\"hero-moment\\" search but overall the trilogy was such a satisfaction. loved it...thank god for words :)
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This was supposed to pay tribute to The Wizard of Oz but it didn't. The acting was sub-par the characters were poorly written overall I'd give this movie a D
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I love this bands harmonies, they seem to want to be a party band but their strength are the ballads that touch you.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This looked like it would be a lot of fun.  It downloaded easily. But when I tried to open it, my Kindle went black and I was stuck...I thought forever.  I finally got the Kindle to come back on,but when I tried to open the puzzle, it &#34;crashed me Kindle again.  At that point my grandson deleted it for me.<br /><br />So I never got to  play Magic Puzzle.  So sad.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I always liked doing puzzles, but with two kids, I don't have time to do them. They also like to play with the pieces. Now, I can do a puzzle as I have time and save it for later if I need to.
0385344228|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB by William Landy will be a classic read, is a classic read.  One great story.  How far would you go to defend your family?  That's the question as Andy Barber deals with his son, a teenager accused of murder.  How do you deal with job, town, friends, family?  This one blew my socks off.  READ THIS ONE.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun but is not as good as the original one. They just added too much and it lost the simplicity of the game, but is still a very fun game. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in new game experiences.

B00992CF6W|3.0|Why amazon don't we have the 0.7.0 update, I paid for this but its out of date. You guys shpuld get the update fast because all people like me want the update now
B004RKXNDU|1.0|didn't like the characters and found the book slow and boring.  would never read another book about George Smiley, spy
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is such a good first person shooter I would recommend it for anybody that loves shooting games<br /><br />There is only 2 words to describe this game bad@$$
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|While I don't necessarily agree with anyone giving this 5 stars because it definitely isn't a masterpiece of any kind they came out with something one should have expected. If you wait awhile and listen to it a few times before you run to your computer to make and intense positive or negative review you will hear Ozzy sounding like Ozzy, Iommi shelling out riffs the way he has only in the past 40 years. Like any guitarist that ever existed after a while they just twist and turn notes that they have been playing for years and do the best they can to come up with a new sounding riff. Geezer is tops as usual and I'm assuming he assisted in lyrics as usual. The lyrics can go either way when these guys get together. It's really about the how Ozzy belts 'em out. Brad Wilks does the job on drums so I can't imagine anyone knocking this guy for doing what he was told to the best of his ability. Musically, IMO, the songs sound like a hybrid of Ozzy solo and Iommi's version of Sabbath in the past 25 years. Not exactly like old Sabbath like some positive reviews seem to imply. Overall, it's a listenable album if you put yourself in the mood but I would never compare it in any way shape or form to the old Ozzy days with Sabbath. Sorry, it just doesn't work that way for me.
159463176X|5.0|I have learned more about Afgansitan from reading the books of Khaled Hosseini, especially The Kite Runner and A Thousand Spendend Suns, than I have learned from all the news sources over the past years.  Is this book as good as his first two?  Not quite.  But, it is still an excellent read.  I became very caught up in the mixed stories and how they all come to fit together.  The ending was not as powerful as his first two books, but it was emotionally satisfying.  And The Mountains Echoed is well written and I enjoyed it very much.  I look forward to his next book.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Not everyone would appreciate this kind of humor, but I find it addicting to watch. Can't wait to see what they come up with next. And Shaun is a lovable rascal.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The characters are really well developed and each conveys their aspect of the story very well.  Like any good series, you find yourself loving and hating certain characters throughout the show, but none seem to overstay their visit (like your typicaly TV bad guy that never dies - none of that here).<br /><br />Even people I know, who are not the type to engage in a Zombie Apocalypse type drama, are finding the show irresistible. Give it a try.
0321885112|5.0|Mike does a wonderful job explaining the concept and making even the most unsure sketchnoter feel at ease with the concept. I love how he breaks down the system into small chunks and teaches you how to listen to the talk more than he is teaching you how to sketch.<br />You could not ask for a better resource to page through to grab a hold of a better note taking and note making concept.
0553582038|4.0|A Feast for Crows is the fourth book in The Song of Ice and Fire series (after A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Crows and before A Dance with Dragons, The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) and A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)).<br /><br />This volume is chronologically parallel to A Dance with Dragons and focuses on events in the West and South of Westeros.<br /><br />Both Sansa and Tyrion have escaped King's Landing. Brienne of Tarth is looking for the former, whereas Cersei takes advantage of the disappearance of her brother to seize power for herself. She sends Jaime to reconquer Harrenhal, The Twins and Riverrun.<br /><br />In the Iron Isles, Asha Greyjoy and her uncles fight for the throne. Euron sends Victorion to conquer Dænerys's heart.<br /><br />After the Red Viper's death, Dorne is torn between revenge and their allegiance to Tywin Lannister.<br /><br />Samwell Tarly, accompanied with Gilly and her baby, is sent to Old Town to become a mæster, while Arya becomes a novice at the House of Black and White in Braavos.<br /><br />Like with the previous volumes, I found that even though the story in itself could be absorbing, George RR Martin's description of every tiny detail makes reading tiresome. So when I put down his books, I have a mixed feeling of both relief and desire to know what happens next. Especially now, I want to know what the other half of characters were up to during that time.
B007L96SI6|3.0|Unfortunately, the producers tried to make Ms. Reinhart into a pop singer instead of the the jazzy, blusey singer she presented on Idol. I believe they missed the boat. She has a great voice and would be much better recieved by the listening audience with some songs with some punch and grind. More like Janis Joplin whom she has been compared to many times.
B009EAO38C|4.0|Album is great, but watching their videos on YouTube will make you appreciate the music more.  Very talented group of musicians.
B0095GSKDE|5.0|What can I say? I'm just a huge Malcolm fan and this one doesn't disappoint. I love how he can go from point A to Z then bring it back around to A again.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This book has it all--great pictures, clear instructions, and a fantastic variety of ideas.  It is neatly organized into chapters, making it easy to focus on a particular stitch or project.  Well worth the price and lots of fun.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Hopefully the book will spark discussion of important issues for both men and women. And for women who aspire to leadership and men in leadership positions there are interesting observations and tips on career advancement.
0553841122|4.0|A Dance with Dragons if the fifth book in The Song of Ice and Fire series (after A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Crows and a Feast for Crows and before, The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) and A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)).<br /><br />The beginning of this volume is chronologically parallel to A Feast for Crows and focuses on the other half of characters, on events in the North of Westeros and beyond the Narrow Sea.<br /><br />Tyrion's part starts in Pentos, where he will be embarked on an unusual adventure to Volantis and Mereen.<br /><br />In the East, both Quentyn Martell, Victarion Greyjoy are on their way to Mereen to ask Dænerys's hand in marriage, while she tries to conciliate dragons, husband, lover and peace for her people.<br /><br />At the Wall, Jon is trying to cozy up to Stannis and the Red Priestess Melisandre, to ensure their help in the defense against the Others.<br /><br />Beyond it, Bran is searching the three-eyed crow with Hodor, Meera and Jojen Reed, and Summer.<br /><br />In the last quarter of the book, characters from A Feast for Crows rejoin the cast as timeframes are once again synchronized.<br /><br />It took me over six months to finish this heavy volume! And even though I'm very glad to finally be done with it, one particular event in the last chapters came as a great shock and now I can't wait to read The Winds of Winter (whenever it comes out).
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I have loved the movie for years,but never read the books.Wonderful just wonderful. I love reading this book. Up lifting.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I thought that this is an excellient piece thoughtfully written.  The scientific approach taken by Dr. Alexander should speak to the many people who use science as a means to justify a scepticism of spirituality and consciousness.  The works referenced in the book, as well as David Bohm's Wholeness and the Implicate Order and Joseph Jaworski's Synchronicity made excellent reading for those of scientific bent trying to make sense of God.
1439199388|5.0|This is a MUST read for any one dealing with allergies and/or auto immune disease. We had already begun helminthic therapy for our child with Crohn's disease (18 months ago) and this not only confirms our decision, it is a masterfully researched and written. Thank you Moises!
B0057VY45O|4.0|Everything about this series is implausible.  A lawyer that wins every time by pulling a stunt at the last second.  A protege that is smarter than any human yet needs his mentor and otherwise wouldn't fit into society.  A sexy paralegal that always looks great and is never actually available.<br /><br />The acting is great - first rate.<br /><br />The bad thing is the show transmits the notion that one gets ahead by making up clever lies on the spot.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I will definitely recommend this charger. Nothing compare with the cheap ones. It is worth the money. We charge the kindle, ipad, ipod, iphone. It is an excellent product.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because good science fiction engages the viewer to consider the human condition. I think if we were ever contacted by people from other worlds our initial response would be as portrayed in the film. Enjoy the possibilities and don't forget the popcorn.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not too hard. Except for the number puzzle! Would like more levels with more things to find each level.
159463176X|3.0|Looking forward to this book, but it didn't fill the bill.  To me, the chapters were disjointed and scattered.  I had to read 2-3 pages to know where the writer was many times, not knowing who was doing the \\"talking\\".<br /><br />The story regarding Marcus was completely out of line for this book.  I didn't care one IOTA about him or it.  To me this was a story about Afghanistan and didn't see why we were reading about this Greek doctor.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I think I would have prefered if it had continued on about Abdullah and how he ended up in states and especially how he coped with losing his little sister, instead of Marcus.<br /><br />On another note, how did these parents really feel about selling their children.  It was not noted how Saboor coped.<br /><br />The ending was sad, but it did bring the story together with the two Pari's
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I thought the movie was very confusing and they missed a lot of important information so people that are not familiar with the details of the events can follow the story.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Big fan of BS! His records keep getting better. He takes some risks with a couple of songs, but that is par for the course. He seems to really have fun in the recording studio. Great title, too.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|One of the lesser entertainment movies in the Die Hard series.  Actually found it a little boring, and like I rated it, &#34;It's okay!&#34;
B0091REZMW|5.0|Wow!!!  So many rooms to explore. So many collections to... collect?  There are hours upon hours of searching and helping fun. A game you can actually play for FREE without purchasing &quot;in app&quot; items to keep you going for more than 15 minutes.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I'm so glad I'm catching up on this show.  It's a great soap opera and streams perfectly to my Kindle. The acting is terrific and there is great chemistry among the actors.  I'm enjoying at least as much as I enjoyed ER and St. Elsewhere.
B009K0P10K|5.0|During recuperation from shoulder surgery, a friend suggested season one on Amazon Prime Instant Video...network tv without commercials interrupting every few minutes.  While not a regular tv viewer, I watched every episode and enjoyed the show very much and so moved on to Season Two.  The intrigues and in-fighting simply wear you out but it is well written, well acted, has amazing quality photography.  The locations are a delight visually.  Perhaps, most important, there are characters I was drawn to really care about...and as I'm completing seeing season two, I simply cannot wait for Season Three.
B0030SCPZ2|5.0|I enjoyed the whole movie. The dialogue was interesting and the music blew me away. I need 3 more words.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Thought this was really cute and the narrative by the main character is really entertaining.  A nice break from super violent zombie movies and shows, but still fits well in the genre.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love this game!!!! i generally stay away from any apps or games that require any type ofr payment in order to play, but i took a chance with this game and i'm glad that i did! i havent had to pay a cent and i've been playing this game for hours on end. if you play game and complete levels, you dont need to spend any money b/c you can earn your way to new cars and new levels. i am addicted to this game! hard for me to put down! if you are looking for a good, challenging game that doesnt need credit card info, then this is the game for ya!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The continuing story of Gideon and Eva.....Sylvia Day rocks it!  This author has the ability to make each book in this series not only interesting and page turning, but hot as hell!<br /><br />Gideon and Eva have backgrounds that cause them both to have major insecurities.  This book deals with that in a way that is erotic, heart warming and touching.  Their possessiveness of each other creates tense moments but are filled with love.<br /><br />\\"We were obsessed, dependent on each other in the unrelenting way of addicts\\".<br /><br />Conflicted by their pasts and the secret they held between them, Gideon and Eva struggle to fully trust and accept each other without hesitation.  With an all consuming love for one another they work their way through obstacles in a way that only true soul mates can accomplish.<br /><br />\\"I breathed him in, feeling my body respond to his scent, instinctively reacting to its mate\\".<br /><br />The author writes these characters as lifelong mates....animal instinct type mates.  It leaves you wanting them to find their way and hoping that in the end they will be blessed with a true sense of themselves and each other.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars because that is what it deserves.  I for one am happy that the story will continue in books 4 & 5.  The author writes each book with intensity and leaves me wanting more and more!<br /><br />*As a side note:  For those of you who gave a one star review and didn't even read the book....how insane.  How do you rate something you haven't read?  It's disgusting to say the least.  For those who wanted an ending in this book....ah well, life doesn't always go your way.  Many of us want more!  Just make up your own ending and stop reading the series!  Simple as that!  For me (and many others) I say..... ROCK ON SYLVIA DAY!
B008N1LL42|4.0|I like the fact it not a blood and gut type move and no profanity as well. I give it PG 13

0471463396|5.0|Several months ago, I was walking in my bedroom, and in a stack of books that we frequently give as gifts, I saw the book Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond.  I said to myself, where did this come from?  I looked at it, and realized that hadn't read it.  I looked at the copyright date, and realized that 2001 is a relatively old book.<br /><br />So I read the first chapter, decided it was good stuff, and added it to the reading pile.  As some might know, I am a value investor, and recently I wrote an article called \\"Value Investing Flavors.\\"  In it, I took a broad view of value investing, because there are many common principles to value investing employed by all, but many variations on implementation. [Note to those reading at Amazon; they don't me post links, but if you Google \\"Aleph From Graham to Buffett and Beyond\\" you will find it.]<br /><br />The book begins with unified principles of value investing: margin of safety, buy ing an asset cheap, etc., but moves on to different ways to implement value investing, depending on the types of companiesthe investor wants to analyze.<br /><br />There are three ways to do the analysis for value investing:<br /><br />*  Re-estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  This applies best to companies where converting resources to a better use would be compelling.<br />*  Estimate the normalized earnings power of a slow growing company.<br />*  For a company with a moat, a sustainable competitive advantage, conservatively estimate the path of growing earnings.<br /><br />I listed the three of them in the order of increasing aggressiveness of analysis, and the amount of work that would need to be done to be assured that there is an opportunity.<br /><br />After this, the book writes about eight notable value investors, who come from the various camps inside value investing, and puts more flesh on the bones as to the implementation of each method.  I immediately recognized the names of 6 of the 8 value investors.<br /><br />But what I found most useful were the insights of the investors that would buy small companies.  You can buy ugly situations that are misunderstood, and wait for management to turn the ship around.<br /><br />This book was a good balance between theory and practice.  I enjoyed this book.  I think most amateurs wanting to learn about value investing would benefit from it.<br /><br />Quibbles<br /><br />None.<br /><br />Who would benefit from this book: Amateur value investors will benefit from this book; if the reader does not want to put the effort into learning value investing, this book will be of no use to him.s of 6 of the 8 value investors.<br /><br />But what I found most useful were the insights of the investors that would buy small companies.

A masterpiece of the modern metal!<br /><br />If you haven't heard Tarja's voice, I invite you to buy this album and listen her unique voice, talent and a team of excellent musicians.<br /><br />What I like most of this DVD? The entire show and the warmth of latin american metalheads.<br /><br />I enjoyed every song. Tarja rocks!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Plenty of variety in the mini games to hold a child's attention yet easy enough that a child can play them without parental help.

B00AQA94M4|5.0|I really like this album as much as I like previous albums. The story, symphonic sound, voices and lyrics make of Avantasia a modern and talented music.<br /><br />An excellent detail in the booklet are the Tobbia's words of thanks on the second page.
B00005JPKE|5.0|A must see. Ken Watanabe and the supporting cast were great. This movie shows you how brave the soldiers on both sides were and how many ordinary Japanese men were forced to go to war.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed our evenings watching episode of Season 1 of The Good Wife. A very believable set of circumstances structured the series to have good stand alone drama which was enhanced by the major  plot development of the fall from grace of Peter, the DA and the confident and satisfying success of Alicia as she developed her legal carer. The format of Amazon Prime without the commercial interruptions really made an evening at our ROKU theater a lot of fun for us. Just starting season 2 with eager anticipation. Some of the interactions with support cast were intriguing as one wonders about the true nature of the individual roles and where they are headed relative to the overall plot.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It is a very informative book.  I got lost when some of the explanations of the computer jargon were described, but the story of the man was really interesting.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This is definitely the best game from TeamLava. I really loved Pet Shop Story and Bakery Story too! But this one really takes the cake. Its entertaining, fun, and addicting! I also love how you can send gold to your neighbors. It's hard to earn in other games.

0679731369|5.0|This is a book I abandoned after I trudged through the first 20 pages and then gave up some years ago. I had bought it after having thoroughly enjoyed Julian Barnes' A History of the World in 10.5 chapters'. I have since read his other books and found it strange why I had abandoned this particular book in my first attempt. And now that I had finished it, I have to say it will be a book that deserves a 2nd and even a 3rd reading. I think some prior knowledge of who Gustave Flaubert is (Googling will suffice) will be a prerequisite (which could be the reason I personally found it hard to follow) to appreciating this book which is part fiction, part literary criticism and rather entertaining. Quite some scholarly research (and I suspect admiration of the Man) must have been done by Julian Barnes; obvious from the many cross references, the collage of quotations littered throughout the book. The book is the narration of a retired doctor who is fascinated by Flaubert and driven to pursue the real identity of the parrot behind the writing of \\"a simple heart\\" (while suffering from his wife's betrayal and suicide). Segments I particularly enjoy are: 1) \\"examination paper\\" (which showed the intimate knowledge and scholarly research by Julian Barnes, 2) Braithwaite's dictionary of accepted ideas, 3)Louise Colet's version and 4) Train-spotter's guide to Flaubert (which illustrates how in the name of literary research, one can missed the wood for the trees). Who's the true Flaubert? By this book Julian Barnes would forever colour future generations' view of the man...for oftentimes truth is what was recorded and as Julian Barnes has so cleverly juxtaposed a multiplicity of perspectives on the man Flaubert many will parrot his views.
B00957T6X6|5.0|this book has everything! Adventure, scif-fi, paranormal, romance... EVERYTHING! my friend has been asking you to read the series for a long time and I am very glad that I finally did! can't wait for more!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is literally one of the best shows i have ever seen. The whole cast is brilliant, especially Tatiana Maslany.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a total surpise.....one of those books you randomly pick to read that turns out to be a page turner and an eye opener!  Harold Fry is an ordinary man  who does an extraordinary thing. I couldn't put it down.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|I got this for my toddler because she is learning her animals.  She has yet to enjoy a trip to the zoo but she loved playing with this set at home.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|The music is on the CD is beyond words.  It will be on my IPOD playlist for a long time.  I see others have given some great reviews on Dancer and the Moon.<br /><br />I bought the deluxe edition.  The DVD has the making of Dancer and the Moon, along with four bonus acoustic videos.<br /><br />The making of Dancer and the Moon is about 28 minutes. Richie and Candice go through each song, and how they came about.<br /><br />The acoustic videos are just with Richie and Candice.  The videos are a little less than two minutes each, but are out of this world.  They are: The Spinners Tale, Somewhere Over the Sea/Moon Shining, The Ashgrove, and Queen for a Day.  These are not on the making of Dancer and the Moon.<br /><br />This is one great album.
B00005Y46O|5.0|This is Free at their best. Free, to me, were one of the best bands of their era.  Paul Rodgers has one of the best voices to sing in rock n roll. Paul Kossoff is on that short list of the best guitarists to pick up an ax. The bass playing of Any Fraiser is so unique he plays complex melodies while Kossoff plays bluesy and slow. Kind of like the dynamic in The Who of Townsend playing the power chords and John Entwhistle playing the fluid riffs and melodies. The funky memorable drumming of Simon Kirke is perfect with the dynamic of Kossoff and Fraisier. Just a great band that live really shine.<br /><br />\\"Moonshine\\" is the song here that really illustrates that slow burn that builds and burns to a climax. Totally intense. The sound here is great and the expanded tracks add so much to the original album. This is such a great CD. Long live Free!

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It seemed slow at first to get to the point. The beginning struck me a little as too familiar with &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; but that said. It was a very good book with plenty of twists and turns. I recommend for any more serious fantasy readers
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I saw Michael Mosley's series on PBS and was very impressed. Decided to follow both his exercise and eating guidelines and downloaded this book. I've now been on the plan for about a month. My weight is dropping steadily and, more importantly, this seems (after a lifetime of looking) to be something I can easily stick with and incorporate into my lifestyle.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|the only problem was less than 1 week after received it, got an error, I need to send it for warranty, after waiting more than a month, get it fixed, still using it & no more problems with it.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|you only get 8 hrs to watch this movie so by the time we sat down that night the timer was over ....
B00004S6GL|5.0|A friend of mine turned me on to this record and Elliot Smith. I'd never heard his music. Man this is so good. Just a unique songwriter with catchy layered songs that rock.<br /><br />He has roots, Beatley, Big Stary , and a Brian Wilson crazy genius command to his songs. Relatable to the past but his own man. His lyrics are very unique to him, not sure if anyone has his exact sensibility. This is rock n roll which grows better on each listen. Highly recommended music. All his stuff has something to it but this is my favorite record. So talented and such accessible music, check out Figure 8, it rocks!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with his other books, he is a very talented storyteller. The way he wove several stories together was wonderful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great, on the edge of your seat story! These is a great book to get involved with for a great summer beach read! Love all the twists and turns.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great way to end the series.  I really enjoyed this last book, I think I read it in less than 24 hours because I just couldn't put it down!
B000O77SOK|5.0|This was one of my favorite shows on tv.  So disappointed it went off the air..but I guess, as they say, &#34;all good things must come to an end&#34;.<br />I would get up every Saturday morning at 7:00 just to watch the reruns.  Imagine on my day off...that's how much I enjoyed this show!!!  Anyone who loves to watch how the justice systems works but with a definite twist of the unusual should really consider buying the series to this &#34;awesome&#34; show!<br />Enjoy!!
B007EE4XKI|2.0|I really liked the start up of this book, as it flowed well and I was able to see everything transpiring as well as getting acquainted with the crew.  However, when it got into the 5th (I think) chapter which was all about the doctor that made Data, I got lost.  It went into details I had no previous knowledge about, nor was I interested.  I wanted to get back to the mystery of Who stole the info about who and what made data work and respond as he did.<br />Anyway, I stopped reading this book around chapter 8, deleted it and looked for another book for my Kindle.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The product is working excellently. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good car charger. It is better than most in the market.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|do it do it. I love this game I have seen the movie two times it is awesome get it
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Actually heard some of this album while traveling overseas.  The people in the store where it was playing were shocked that I didn't know the band.  I know why now...the music is great.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Very addicting game, fun to play, challenging game, It will definitely take up hours of your time, very good game
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|One of my favs. Got for my grandson on my kindle fire. He loves it and it keeps him entertained. Would definitely recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The journey of August Pullman a10 year old \\"facial anomaly\\" going through the confusing and God knows tough time of middle school is touching in so many ways every thing he goes through while he still manages to so thankful for what he has and the experiences of those around him truly is (as the name implies) a wonder
B009X01C64|5.0|holds my kindle in landscape or rotates to portrait. durable case to protect my investment. recommend it highly to kindle owners
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|To me, this movie was a big let down, so if you haven't seen it yet dont read this because here's a spoiler alert-this movie was basically a rehash of Star Trek 2 all  over again.So all these &#34;Brilliant&#34; reviews really have me baffled to say the least. I can only hope abhrams is more original in the next one.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Great series of movies. While all dialogue it moves quickly.  Adult themes...no kids.  If you like Paris you wlll like Before Sunset
B007FIY3VW|4.0|App seems to work well. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't create Powerpoint files, but not sure if this is the right medium for creating slide decks anyway. Small Word/Excel files should be no problem at all!<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it! Great for people of all ages and cool bonus features, and super fun! It's free so I would definitely get it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Very fast paced. Full of action and it is fun to read. Very well written. I hope for a movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|An exciting read! Well written and crafted. The story took many twists and turns. Fantastic plot! Character development was superb.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|movie is good .....took a while to get it I was sent a DVD that only played in other countries ? why I don't know....? but this one plays in the U.S.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is always up to date and gives maps and forcasts in various formats.  I can quickly check the weather in any location I plan to visit.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|Loved it in the theatres and love it even more now that I've got it home!!! Can't wait till the next movie comes out!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I have always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes stories and this book of course doesn't disappoint. That said there aren't many of the more famous stories in this book. Many of them are short and once in a blue moon rely on Sherlock solving the puzzle using information previously unknowable by the reader. However these mysteries are more for enjoying the journey, not trying to solve the mystery yourself. I would have liked some of them to be about twice as long as they were. Right after getting into it, it ends.<br /><br />Still even if you're even slightly interested in the genre, these are all great short reads, and when the biggest criticism is &#34;there wasn't enough&#34;, well, that's a compliment as well.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|We paid extra for HD but the picture was very poor quality....grainy, and blurry.. I don't know what else to say.
B0067TGSOK|3.0|Helpful material, but things I already knew from prior internet searches and other books I had read. Chris has an enthusiasm that surpasses other writers and makes up for anything lacking.
B009NP6ID6|4.0|A futuristic, dark, thriller! Pretty wild story line! But Like I said, Every movie that Vin Diesel 's in, HAS SOME CLOUT!!
B007HUD6OS|4.0|The Theodore Boone series is great for the teens and adults alike.  Can wait for the next book in the series.
B00C5ZS5SC|4.0|Best way to describe Jessie is Sade meets Lana Del Ray.<br /><br />I think she has an instant classic with catchy hooks and soulful melodies..<br />Jessie does a good job in relating real struggles of love in a sensual way.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Was hooked on Eureka from the get go. The plot, the people just seemed to get better as it went along. I would recommend the whole series, not just the First Season.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What a fantastic collection of new Sabbath songs. Every song is a hit in my opinion and all four Band members are ROCKIN. Over the years I've collected everything Sabbath has ever done and I was so looking forward to hearing this. I Love that sound and was not let down in any way. Great songs and Great performance!
0345525558|4.0|The language of flowers is used to develop the life and character of Victoria, a foster child victimized by the system.  It could have been a trite story, but the author presents a believable victim who rises above her circumstances and takes hold of her life.  The book is well-written.  There are some hard scenes to read about, but they are not graphic, but by creating a positive result, the author presents hope for all the characters and the reader.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|The film work in this one is amazing, but the story line was just a touch slow and too drawn out for me.  I fell asleep.<br /><br />It's a very good story with amazing content, but again, it is a slow moving story line.  Just so you know.<br /><br />Thanks.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|It is Taylor Swift.  She is very talented and keeps putting out good music.  I got this for my wife.
0156421178|5.0|I enjoyed the book as a revelation of the Spanish Civil War.  It shows the inside track of the struggle for a new Spain.  There are many factions and philosophies tugging at one another while the people suffer deprivation and horror.  Standing up for what is right is quite individual in this period of European history just before World War II.  Catalonia tried to hold its own place.  Orwell's role in this was surprising and insightful.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|This album rocks it has some moments of its classic songs before. I still can't believe Tony guitar playing. This album doesn't disappoint.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|Could be a really great app but it's way to technical.  You go onto settings and you are prompted into a menu that a rocket scientist would love!  Highlight the wrong prompt and you're looking to find the reset prompts.  Guess it's just a little more technical than what I need in a calender app.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Looking forward to reading future books. Can be bloody at times.  Story had enough suspense to keep you reading
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|If you like trying to really figure out a film, this is one you will enjoy.<br /><br />I watched this, closely and was still guessing by the last quarter.  What a \\"mind ride\\" and this one is a good one!<br /><br />Just when you think you have it figured out, bam, another surprise turn.  Really like it.<br /><br />Thanks!!
B0047SF41G|4.0|very entertaining, though there were a LOT of plot aspects taken from the first Predator, which I considered more of a homage than just outright un-originality. Could've been better, but I'd watch again on TV.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|After reading some rave reviews, I was disappointed. To me this sounds pretty much like the last few albums he's done. That's not a bad thing, I just thought it was going to be more of a change. Pretty unimaginative cover for a Bowie album, too.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I laughed,  I cried. Great read. I read the book before the movie and of course like the book better. I recommend to all my friends
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I thought this was amusing and touching. I love British humor. Quirky characters --especially  Sam the little boy desperately in love with the  Most beautiful girl in school
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you read the first book you should read the second.  It is amazing how cruel human beings can be to one another
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is perfect for the 30 something comedy lover, the references to other movies are from our childhood. Very witty.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Easy for the young kids to purchase in-app addons. Developers did this on purpose.  Yes, I have in-app purchased disabled.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. The whole cast is completely believable and genuine, while Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, and Natalie Portman are off the charts as actors. The story is very satisfying.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Best game ever I really recommend that you play this game me personally took a couple of tries but it is fun
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|Glad it was free just did a trail and there is no explanation no examples and it sucks don't waste your time
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife ordered this \\"chick flick\\" that I thought I wouldn't enjoy.  I was hooked at the first episode.  Loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using this program.  It's like shopping with pictures.  I get all sorts of awesome ideas from the different pages offered too.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I didn't want to stop once I got into it. Figuring out what to do is what makes these games so much fun.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|once again g5 come up with an excellent adventure games. My most favorite game was nightmares and I can tell this one is gonna be a close runner up if not surpass it. I love the adventure games with hidden objects and so far this one is right up my alley!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Fun musical film. I quite enjoyed the production value. The cast is also fairly interesting. For fans of music, it is a must have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is so easy to use, I am a seventh grader stuck on a math problem and now SURE of my answer. I love love love this app!
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|If you have not read the source material (and been one of the fans who has dreamed of seeing it brought to life), this two-part movie may not be for you. This being a review of part 2, let me start with the good parts. It did get interesting in about the last third of the film, and it ended on a relatively \\"up\\" note given how bleak the world was by the end of the film.<br /><br />That being said, the first two thirds of the film were filled with tedious and pointless \\"action\\" in which Batman spent more time beating up the police than he did the bad guys; often with very little apparent motivation. This is a pretty jarring change of behavior for a character who has always had a very good reason for every action he's ever taken.<br /><br />Final thought, if you are even considering purchasing this movie on DVD, I very strongly recommend that you rent it first - try it before you buy it - you may be glad you did.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Brilliant story, excellently written.<br />A voyage of personal discovery and awakening through researching ultra-distance running.<br />You feel like you're with the author all the way through his struggles and triumphs.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show has great writers - the dialogue is fun and smart and the plot is thoroughly engaging. The actors are also impressively convincing. I'm hooked!
B002WY65VU|3.0|I purchased this becasue I like zombies, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price or spend the money to see it in the theater.
0240808452|5.0|This was probably the best book I ever bought on drawing. Although it specifies, for animators, I found it just as useful for regular figure drawing.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I was very happy with the quality of the DVD. XXXX! I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a great move on a quality DVD
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I am new to Doctor Who and I started off with the 21st century reboot (also a continuation) of the Doctor Who series.  Season 1 of the new Doctor Who is the perfect introduction to Doctor Who.  You learn of the TARDIS, the Time Lords, time and space travel, and you get an introduction to many of the alien life forms that are a staple to Doctor Who.  On top of all that, you get the compelling story (and travels) of the 9th Doctor and his companion Rose.  Doctor Who season 1 is part a love story, a drama, a comedy, a sci fi adventure, but it's 100% entertaining!<br /><br />If you are new to the Doctor Who mythos like I was, you must start off with the adventures of the 9th Doctor and Rose!  Enjoy!
B005544V6A|5.0|Fun to watch the way the lawyers outsmart each other. Good interpersonal interaction of the characters.  Good story lines and trial scenes.
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|I remember seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was so long ago that I didn't remember what the movie was about.  I did enjoy watching it again.  Soundtrack is great!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is better than most movies.  It is fast paced; stories are always intriguing; and the acting doesn't feel like acting.  It is pretty perfect.  I am blown away by the first season.  I hope that the quality continues in the following seasons.
B008P9M614|5.0|I am a sucker for House's antics.  His personality and sense of humor match mine perfectly (not sure if that is a good thing or not).  It is semi graphic so if you don't like blood and semi-realistic views of the inside of human bodies - this may not be for you.<br /><br />There are a few episodes that get a little too serious for me but they always seem to come back to the good old House that I like to watch.  If you like the show - the complete series is a no brainer.<br /><br />I would also recommend the mentalist for a similar type of personality in a different show.<br /><br />5 Stars from me.
B00821PEYG|1.0|Watching another comparable post-apo story \\"Walking Dead\\" is like being on cocaine, watching \\"Falling Nonsense\\"...I mean \\"Skies\\" is like being on sedatives and trying to solve cross word puzzle. How this thing make it to the 3rd season?
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Not as gripping as the Camel Club and the twist could be seen coming a mile away but a pleasant way to spend a couple evenings.
B00BI745AA|3.0|Russell Crowe needs to stick to acting, a job he does exceedingly well. His singing role in this classic was far too important for a mediocre voice.
B005N09L5C|4.0|A movie I always wanted to see.  It was strange and depressing but had a message pertinent to the times we live in.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Really ticked off. This is my favorite version. Was too excited to see an update today. I install and suddenly EVERY TIME I hit cloud city, I get booted out of the whole gAme and sent to this page.  So I 're-boot my kindle fire thinking that would help,,,,it did not. So Against my better judgement, I uninstall the whole thing hoping that 're-installing would fix it. It DID NOT. So now not only have I lost all of my progress and have to start over,,, I STILL get booted from the game every time I hit that stupid clod city.. I am an ANGRY BIRD.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|The biggest problem with &#34;Warm Bodies&#34; is that it's a novel idea that should be catered toward people who have seen a lot of zombie movies. Instead, it seems catered to 14-16 year old girls who have heard of zombies and love Nicholas Hoult. Don't get me wrong; I like Nicholas Hoult. Loved him in &#34;About A Boy&#34;, liked him in &#34;X-Men: First Class&#34;. Haven't really seen any other movies of his, but he seems to rise to the level of whatever he's in, and in the case of this movie he's not done any favors.<br /><br />The casting seems to be mostly WB Pilot rejects, the script sounded like it was written by a girl who read and loved the Twilight series (scenes full of vague, emotional outbursts and simmering), and, for a romantic comedy / zombie movie, it had neither a charming protagonist nor entertaining violence. It's a PG-13 movie in every way; compromising, tepid, contrived, self-congratulatory, and lame. Get the tongue out of your cheek long enough to tell a story.<br /><br />With the absolute pile of zombie-apoc movies out there in the last ten years, I'm really disappointed &#34;Warm Bodies&#34; plays it this safe. It lacks a maturity or potency in its irony that might really win you over, but it never stops winking to the camera. The idea that a cute zombie has a self-deprecating, twenty-something inner-monologue, and can become a real person if he meets the right girl (&#34;and isn't that just such a commentary on our generation&#34;), is enough to get someone to see this movie. But it's not enough to carry the audience through 90 minutes. We're bombarded with these themes so regularly already, that we &#34;Get It&#34; inside of about 3 minutes once the movie starts, but the director wants to make absolutely sure every half-baked situation is set-up, every gag possible is played, and every drop is squeezed out of such an ultimately small fruit.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|quick and easy. fun for all but a real time sucker if your not careful. well there is a bit of a slow start but it is fine one it picks up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Remember the most magical parts of Myst?  This game captures that same magic, but serves it up in a double dose.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Both of us loved the cinematography. My wife loved it overall and I did not care for it, hence it gets a 3
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Even if I don't truly love all 6 films, it's nice to have them all in one set (that takes up less room on the shelf, thus providing more space for more movies).  I call that win-win.  That they're Blu-ray, BONUS!  (Plus, I still have the original 3 on VHS, before they were tampered/fixed.)<br />As for the individual films, some are obviously better than others.  The Empire Strikes Back is the masterpiece of the set.  Attack of the Clones is the worst of the lot, when little orphan Annie is all grown up and throwing snits every two seconds.  This is what comes from hiring someone for their height rather than any real acting ability.<br />What I've always appreciated in all 6 films is the dazzling array of pyrotechnics.  They all excel when it comes to battle sequences and the more personal infighting.  It's the exchanges requiring dialog and the most basic aspects of relationships where things tend to go flat.  The personalities of the better actors fill in where character development is almost nonexistent.  Few have any history that bears repeating never mind being mentioned in the first place.  Characters just show up and you either accept them as is (Jar Jar Binks) or you don't.  As far as the FORCE goes, as often as they explain it (always in ambiguous terms), it still remains a mystery.  If they can see the future and have inklings/feelings of bad things about to happen why is it that they can never figure out who the bad guys are?  Even more disconcerting, the dark side of the force is considered anything to do with aggression, fear, anger, and hatred......yet Luke is instructed to kill his father.  How can murder ever be misconstrued as a good thing?  (No one plays Gandhi in this universe.)<br />My favorites will always be the original three films; at best I will simply tolerate the other three (and won't watch them nearly as much).<br />No matter what, my favorite characters remain the same: C-3PO, R2-D2, and Yoda.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|it was good but when ever all your men die you need to by more. but if you need to finish a task that envoles sap or seeds it stinks.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We are watching this with our 19 year old son during the summer. My stomach was in knots from the first episode. Great suspense, very well written and acted, storyline that jibes with today's events. Can't wait to buy the second season!

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Frequently decides to crash. The pop ups at the start take a while to load which interferes with starting to manage your post while you've been away.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|It pays homage to the old style of Martial Arts movies. The big name actors pull it off very well.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season, I had to see the second season. This one had many more stories and is a bit more disturbing, yet I couldn't wait to see episode after episode. Can't wait for season 3!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|The deluxe edition soundtrack to \\"Man Of Steel\\" is excellent! This is one of the best movie soundtracks of the summer season and of the year, as well.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have never been one that likes to review books. That being said, I am writing a review for this book because I was so very disappointed. I thought that this was the last book! I read the another two books and loved them! I couldn't wait for this book to come out. Then the closer I get to the ending i'm thinking to myself I bet there's going to be another book. I hate to say this, but it's like Ms. Day is just trying to milk it for all its worth. I don't care about the rock star! I don't care about the sick friend! The story line could have been finished with this book. Don't get me wrong - it's a good read. But I probably will not buy the next book.

B00932A4XE|3.0|This is supposed to be based from the book.  It is hilarious, but I'm glad I didn't pay the theater price to see this movie.
006114665X|5.0|Loved the book...was a great look at the situation in Europe prior to WWI....learned more about the situation in the Balkans, a different look at Tsarist Russia and a twist on the British/French relationship.  Felt that the French take the fall for inciting a situation which could have been averted and the Germans unfairly took the hit as the bad guys...
0307476073|4.0|There are a couple of reasons why I should not have liked this book. First of all, it was spectacularly hyped by the time I got to it--Strayed is a local author, so we heard a lot about this book in this neck of the woods. And it was an Oprah book. And it is going to be a movie soon. That alone probably could have kept me from the book except that one of my close friends, whose taste in books is similar to mine, raved about it.<br /><br />Second reason: it falls into a category in my mind of books about women overcoming personal demons and difficult histories that women love and I hate. I grouped it together with The Glass Castle and Carry On, Warrior and, worst of all in my mind, Eat, Pray, Love. Wild definitely shares characteristics with these books, in my opinion, but I guess I'm a slow learner and decided to read it anyway.<br /><br />The third reason became apparent as I started the book. Strayed, at least at the beginning of the book, is incredibly unlikable. This is usually the kiss of death for me when reading memoirs, but not in this case. Strayed is able to write about her past unpleasant self in a way that you just know that she will eventually get past this and, now, she is much nicer. At least I hope so!<br /><br />You'd think it would be a case of three strikes and you're out with this book, but I actually truly enjoyed this book. Yes, Strayed is an utter mess as she starts her hike--and rather, well, stupid when it comes to some her personal choices about hiking and life. But she does learn and she does grow and, really, that is what this book is about.<br /><br />Strayed uses language beautifully and her descriptions make you feel as if you are on the PCT (although, having hiked some sections of the PCT in the Gorge, I have something to compare to which I can compare her descriptions!). She is not afraid to describe the person she really was when she started this journey in 1995.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this book is that, once she gets into Oregon on the trail, Strayed starts to rush towards the end of the book. I understand why this may be--at that point she's well on her way to healing--but I was looking forward to reading her adventures in Oregon as she'd be on my turf! Instead, the bulk of this book takes place on the California segment of the trail.<br /><br />This is not a book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail--there are other books to be found if that is what you are wanting. If you are looking a book about personal growth, recovery and triumph, then Wild would be an excellent book for you.gets into Oregon on the trail, Strayed starts to rush towards the end of the book.

B005GFPZYK|3.0|A good story but sad because we know the true ending. The book is at times intense and informative but occassionly rambles and loses focus, but all in all a good read.
B0026772N8|3.0|The story is a nice one, but there is frankly nothing Zen or even the art of motorcycle maintenance in it except for a couple of sentences here and there. To call it a classic, I didnt find anything particularly interesting.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like the regular Angry Birds better. Sun and Turf Angry Birds is more interesting to play.  It is okay for a short time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Title says it all. They wrap up the trilogy wonderfully. Good luck putting it down. It's a ride to the end.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This is an absolutely solid DVD taught by an amazing bellydancer. It's better if you have some bellydance experience, because some of the moves aren't broken down or explained as well as they could have been. Other than that, the moves are challenging for beginners and useful for intermediates looking to perfect their technique. Rachel even offers advice on how to use the set (which sections to do on different days, etc) and expands upon concepts such as back bending and breathing techniques. It's worth buying just to see her mini-performances.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|A wonderful story, twisted hidden gems, all and all a wonderfully intriguing game to play. A must play for any Quell fan.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|If you enjoyed Knocked Up then you'll like 40. My wife and I found ourselves relating to some of the banter in the movie. Its funny, for the adults, and at times leaves you shaking your head.
B00821OX98|5.0|My son turned me onto Falling Skies.  Wow - excellent show.  Noah Wylie was  wonderful Dr Carter on ER, but he's an even better Tom Mason on FS.  Great show about people coming together to protect their own.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Purchased it for the song &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34; but found that there are so many other tracks that I enjoyed as well.  Well worth it!
B0076NKNLA|5.0|She didn't look EXACTLY like her but in my opinion she played her like I would have imagined her to be and it made me feel like I kind of understood Marilyn better but not sure I really do but her performance made it feel that way.  I loved watching her be Marilyn.  The young boy was great too.  All of it seemed so plausible to me.  I think this might be my favorite all time Marilyn biopic type move.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|All that I expected.  I had already read the book and seeing the movie just make it perfect for me.  I try to read or watch anything having to do with Nicholas Sparks.  Never disappointed.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Enjoyed it so much viewed it a few times. If you like period films this is a good one. The actors did a great job.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|When I started watching it, I didn't think I would like it. but it kept getting better and when it was finished I was glad I rented it.
B007DIQC90|5.0|What a great cd, we love it and seldom buy cd's anymore but loved them on sat night live, get it
B005LAII3A|5.0|This is really nothing like the original, I don't want to spoil it, but from the beginning you can see it's not the same. It seams more real.
1416563156|5.0|Santa left this for my 7 year old son with a note that Indy gave it to Santa for safekeeping and Santa was entrusting it to my son to keep safe for Indy.  My son loves browsing through this.  Carrying it around in his Indy messenger bag.  I love it.  Great idea.  Fun to browse through, great pix, cute commentary (like in the movie, cute/funny/ keeping us in on the &#34;jokes.&#34;)
B0057ZAA0S|4.0|To be blunt, this is not an easy film to watch. I took the chance because of the brilliance of the director, Danny Boyle, who has helmed such cinema classic as \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", \\"Sunshine\\", \\"127 Hours\\" and \\"28 Days Later\\". Slumdog is the first Bollywood movie to be a hit in Hollywood. Sunshine is one of my favorite SciFi films on the 2000's, 28 Days Later is mentioned with the best Zombie movies on nearly every list of best Zombie movies and even 127 Hours manages to make that well known troll, James Franco, look decent and like an A-lister. Let's face it, Danny Boyle has the golden touch.<br /><br />Based on that AND the fact that Trainspotting is getting it's own sequel called \\"Porno\\", I decided to give Trainspotting a shot. I do not normally watch movies about drug addiction. It hits too close to home and I don't find it funny. Nobody comes into this world saying proudly \\"When I grow up, I want to be addicted to heroin.\\" The thought of having to rob people just so you can buy  drugs so that when you wake up in the morning, you have your morning fix. All that just so you don't start off the day sick. Or that you steal from family and friends until you have no family and no friends, to me, that is depressing and I tend to watch movies that lift my spirit, educate me or scare the hell out of me. I justified that this one met criteria #2 and #3.<br /><br />Like I said, this film is not easy to watch. You are bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort. You may well get sick just from watching. As he has shown again and again, Danny Boyle is brilliant, but I would prefer not to watch his vision of Ewan climbing into the grossest commode in the long history of cinema (well done, Scotland!). The thing is it does not condescend or patronize. It exists and I will never watch that scene again.<br /><br />I found this movie disgusting and brilliant. How you will take it, I suppose, depends on where you are in the world and what your experience has been personally or perhaps with a family member and their relationship to addiction, intervention, confrontation, tough love and no love. Addiction is a terrible thing. Trying to capture it on film is auspicious. I applaud and curse your efforts. Now go to A&E and watch the last season of \\"Intervention\\"sonally or perhaps with a family member and their relationship to addiction, intervention, confrontation, tough love and no love. Addiction is a terrible thing. Trying to capture it on film is auspicious. I applaud and curse your efforts. Now go to A&E and watch the last season of \\"Intervention\\"
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|This was a better than I expected movie.  I thought the special effects were superb.  Jaden Smith did a great job acting.  After Earth Is A Great Movie With A Great Plot.Kitai And His Dad,Cyper,Have A Sour Relationship.So,In Hopes  Of Bonding,Cyper Takes Kitai On A Trip.While On The Trip,Their Ship Is Destructed By Astroids,And They Crash Land On A Strange Planet Named Earth.Cyper Tells His Son That  He Needs Him To Find A Beacon Or The Won't Survive.
B00821OX98|4.0|I would give it 5 stars for the fact that it is a kind of goofy scifi show that really grows on you. It is kind of like \\"National Treasure\\" meets \\"War of the Worlds\\". However, I cannot get over the cheesy patriotism. If you love SciFi, you will enjoy it, just ignore the obvious \\"product placement\\" you find throughout.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is not so much theories on big bangs and pows and gooshes.. and more about some young kids do jokes and shenanigans.  I really wanted some theories on big bangs.  Like dynamite? What makes it go pow?  What about lawnmower backfire?  Why it go boom?
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Thanks to Apple, the fire wire adapter allows me to now use the full potential of my iMac computer.  It allows me to input video fast.
B008CP93S0|5.0|Jason Patrick plays such an out there dude.  I don't know much about Jason Patrick but I didn't expect any of it out of him and it was a great performance.  Paul Rudd is HI-LAR-IOUS as usual.  The part when he's practicing talking in the mirror is so freaky out there funny weird I was dying.  I actually made my husband watch this cause it was so out there funny and I watched the whole thing with him again.  I rarely EVER watch a movie twice.  I thought Jennifer Aniston looked amazing in this movie.  More so than other movies.  She always looks great but I thought she looked her most perfect self.  And she was super funny and so weird.  And then all the other weird characters, some SNL alums hahahahaha!  Funny!
B001O7JHSE|5.0|Edward Norton is not as appreciated as he should be given his wide range of performances through the years (Fight Club, The Illusionist, Primal Fear and Moonrise Kingdom). His performance in American History X shows how easy it is to get sucked into an organization or ideology and how difficult it is to change.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie shows one of the most brutal murders I've ever seen on film called &#34;curbing&#34; (the act of making a person bite the curb, then stomping on the back of their head killing them. Definition generously provided by the www.UrbanDictionary.com), the bulk of the movie is split between Norton ascension up the ladder of a White Supremacist Organization, his time in jail and his time out of jail where he attempts to leave the group and help change his now racist brother before it is too late.<br /><br />This is a disturbing film I think because it shows how people can make decisions that seem to make sense only to find out that life is more complicated than we often think. Highly recommended.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved it all except for the anti-religious themes, but over all great fun and I highly recommend this fun book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think it is so fun to play . I can play It for hours. I like the selection of the dragons they have in store.
B009AMANH4|5.0|said it all above, where are the Lincolns now? his quiet wisdom along with his abhorrence for war, and slavery are presented masterfully.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|The story line was action packed from the beginning and it held my interest.  I was shocked at the ending though. I wish they would get a new person to play James Bond though.
0817439390|5.0|One of the best books I have read on photography. It is written in a clear, easy to understand manner even when explaining technical details. I found the tips on where to point the camera to get meter readings that work well to be especially helpful. Also appreciated the thoughts on where and when to use various filters. Some of the pictures in the book are really great. The book also gave some &#34;assignments&#34; or things to try with your camera that help you use the instructions and see how they work in real life. I read it from cover to cover and keep going back in to review.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|PROS<br />Pseudo Shakespearean Dialect<br />Great Acting<br />Well Filmed<br /><br />Love this movie. The characters talk in a way in which what they mean is not immediately apparent, every phrase has to be analysed, definitely a movie that needs viewed multiple times for full effect. Sort of a murder mystery, played out by high school students. Except it is every bit as amazing as that sounds terrible. Numerous interesting quirks to notice in the film, for instance, you only see three &#34;adults&#34; in the entire length of it, all the rest of the players are high school students (with the exception of the Pin, his mother, and the Truman, the VP). Easily the only film I own, and possibly the only one I would reccomend, that is set in or around students.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very unique book, can be confusing at times if you lose focus or set the book down for a few days. But awesome all around!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I am very late to the party in watching Food, Inc. long after it came out - and so much has come out and been talked about that I wouldn't say I learned anything new from this documentary because I've learned it from other sources, but I found it interesting and motivating - so much so that I will watch it again with my husband.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I stumbled upon Florence and the Machines by accident and I'm glad I did.  She's a little like Beth Hart without being another Beth Hart.  This album is one of my favorites in the car and I seem to dial it up frequently..Love it.....Highly recommended..
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|the movie was too hard to follow.  It gave just enough to get you interested in one story line, then jumped to another time frame with completely different characters. I could not tell how this was to link together. I did see some characters that were the same from one time frame to another, but the flow was terrible. I only watched the first 40 minutes and decided it was a waste of time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Became addicted to the show;  Superior acting =; great period piece with authentic costumes and staging.  Wish you had season 3 as well.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this app is really easy to use. but you have to remember your username because there is no way to find it.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|It's the complete sixth series of Doctor Who, what is not to like! LOVE Matt Smith as the Doctor!! Buy this NOW!!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|This movie did not get the recognition it should have received.....The reviews were distracted by the sex and missed the underlying story .....a young woman with  Young-onset Parkinson's Disease..and how she coped (  or  failed to cope)  wirh her disease....Even though she had  a disease , she could still have a meaningful and positive personal relationship...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Kept me interested the whole way through. Quick read for sure. I love learning about other cultures, even through fiction and I have read the other two novels by Khaled Hosseini (and I thoroughly enjoyed both of those). In comparison, I found this one to be somewhat fractured, and at times had trouble shifting back and forth from character to character. I imagine this book would make a great movie (along the lines of Babel). In the end, I was left feeling somewhat deflated at the end, because there was no real resolution or redemption. It is a tale about life and the everyday struggle too find meaning in a sea of seemingly random events. All in all, I still enjoyed reading it.
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|Fun free app of the day.  Played it for several weeks.  My two year old loved to see the animals go down on the rollercoaster.
B0086700CM|3.0|It was not so much what I was looking for in a &#34;killing time&#34; scenario that was for a few minutes.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a young woman at odds with her life, decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. No real planning, no conditioning, no experience in distance packing. Buys the things she thinks she will need, and away she goes!! For most of us this would be impossible, but with blisters, and determination she makes it. A worth while read, even if you are not outdoorsy.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I selected this CPU for the long term so I don't have to upgrade my system anytime soon.  It idles at ~1% and the system is lightning fast with a 120GB SSD drive, 18Gb RAM and Win 7.  No need to overclock anytime soon.  With the stock fan, the chip normally runs at ~22C and I've gotten it up to ~53C using Prime95 to stress the system.  With the system running this cool, it will probably last longer than those with TDP's higher than 77W.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been a John Grisham fan for many years and thoroughly enjoyed reading The Racketeer.  Hurry with the next one, please!!
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|Best movie! try the book then rewatch the movie, so much fun. What a disturbed character. Does make you wonder what happens to the main character though...
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Typical matching gems game.  It is fun for awhile, got bored with it after a few weeks.  Not bad, but I have played better
B00CE03UOC|4.0|It's relaxing but there are times when you're convinced &quot;You can't get there from here!&quot;. Fun, relaxing, sometimes challenging, always addicting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sad that it has all come to an end. Cannot wait to see how these next two movies portray the novels.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Its great, what else can you say?  Not kid friendly though so make sure the lil ones are not around!  But I am addicted, love it!!!
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is awesome they just need to put a campaign on it that's the only thing I don't like about it
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I am new to using the Instant Prime Videos - but found it very simple to use -  I traveled on the day this show would come on TV  I just had to wait a day or 2 - and it would be online - 1-click - and I was watching my show with no commercials - PERFECT
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I'll never forget watching Das Boot in a packed movie theater and experiencing myself and the entire audience gasping for breath when the submarine surfaced for air at a dire moment in the movie. We were all in the sub--an amazing accomplishment! I love this movie.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Beautiful graphics keep me looking at this app, but it's fairly limited. I find myself touching the graphics in hopes of finding a link. Still exploring...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Haven't stopped playing it since I started several months ago.<br />Would recommend it to all kinds of gamers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Totally engaging! I tore through this book and stayed up way too late because I had to know what happened next, next and next! I am a voracious reader so am thrilled to bits to have discovered a \\"new to me\\" author. If you enjoy classic sci-fi, you will not be disappointed in this book.
B008JFUORW|3.0|With the Hangover Part III, we are given the end of a trilogy that never needed to occur. The original film was a raunchy, off color story that left me laughing for the majority of its running time. This fresh comedy connected with audiences and became a breakout hit of 2009.<br /><br />Of course, when a movie is successful, it naturally warrants a sequel. With the Hangover Part II, the filmmakers stuck to the basic formula of the first film. While there were still plenty of laughs, it failed to live up to the high standards of the first one. Despite this, it made enough money to warrant yet another sequel.<br /><br />And so we arrive at the Hangover Part III. Although the original cast shows up to this movie, the story seems forced and the laughs are few and far in between. Most of the cast, and the filmmakers it seems, have phoned it in on this one. The movie becomes a kind of action thriller as the wolf pack sets out to find Chow.<br /><br />There are a few redeeming moments to this movie. Zach Galifianakis gives it his all and becomes the character that provides the most genuine laughs. His scene with Melissa McCarthy, in particular, is probably my favorite part of the movie. Additionally, John Goodman is always reliable for a few laughs, and his turn here, as a drug leader desperate to find Chow, is no exception.<br /><br />Overall, this film is more original than the formulaic Part II, but never finds the spark that ignited the original movie into a hit.
B008GJVH7M|5.0|If you're expecting Joel and Ethan Coen comedy, pass this one by.  If you're looking for a well-written and well-acted story about people who happen to be criminals you've come to the right place.  There are several sub-plots and themes lurking below the 1920s / early 30s crime story but I won't give them away here.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|So when it comes to movies like this I am easily pleased.  I like a good light harted movie.  This movie has some simularities to the original movie but different.  I think kids between 8-10 age will really like it, little tots not so much, I am old and I liked it..  I loved the graphics.  I loved the story line.  Just a nice movie worth watching.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We wanted to watch all the movies in the series in a row. This product was perfect. Ingenious packaging gets all 8 DVD's in nice book-like storage. No extras, or bells and whistles, just the movies, which is all we wanted. The quality of the DVD's was perfect.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I could watch this over and over again.  I love the music and the message of the movie itself.  To be forgiven and being willing to forgive is critical to life!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|If you're looking for alternatives read this book.  I really enjoyed it and will lend it to my friends. Thank you
B008Y73940|5.0|A very good law thriller. With surprises around every corner and a top notch cast to engross the audience, I think it is one of Matthew's best.
B005PK57NU|5.0|A good old fashioned soap opera with drama in 48 minutes of won case, very wise people who have the perfect response at every closeup. Just &#34;suspend reality&#34; entertaining. Great
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Best Show Ever.  I started watching on PBS when I was a kid. I love that the new Dr. Who is done so well.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game, used to play the original and this one delivers as well! I just wish that the unlock for the last character wasn't so much. $50 is quite a bit for a character unlock. I could by a full video game for that.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was brest and couldn't put it down. This one was the same!!!  The author certainly knows how to write a book!!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a fun story....entertaining.... easy to read ...historical background informative and thought provoking.  for someone who doesn't like to read straight history (school kids?) it's a great fun way to read a general historical review of the 100 years prior to 2005 enhanced by a fictional story. I can see this as a book a parent and child could enjoy together....depending on interests of the child maybe around age 8-10 years old.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|This book kept me in the dark the whole time, and I couldn’t put it down.  Would recommend it to everyone who loves a thriller!
B00192IOBA|5.0|Jason's music is terrific. On some tunes, he brings to mind a male Norah Jones; or it could be the piano sound; very hip easy-listening.<br />It's perfect for a driving trip or as background for a dinner party. I really love the vocal and horn arrangements. Nice scatting on Butterfly. Great production value but nothing's over produced and his vocals are wonderfully genuine but under-stated. No over the top, affected vocals. Good stuff!
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Great visuals, great story line and the adventure never got boring. All three of my kids (12, 8 and 7) did not want to see it originally but sat through the whole movie withoit a peep.
B002Z0TPFE|4.0|This was an entertaining movie. My fiance really loved it, and I found it entertaining, but a little cheezy sometimes. Would watch it again though.
0783219733|5.0|I bought it for my daughter because she loves animals!  Great gift for an animal lover!!  She loved it!!! Awesome
B0095P29EG|5.0|I was not very familiar with the story of this superhero. Thor is one hot superhero that I found held my interest.  The story is entertaining and appropriate for all.
B004I744AS|4.0|I've not really use it but it is good to have, it helps you interprets.<br />it gives you simple understanding
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is a GREAT CLASSIC &#34;WAR&#34; film showing how much the individual can persevere under duress while maintaining and adhering to their beliefs.
0061950726|4.0|Originally published on my blog at therelentlessreader.blogspot.com<br /><br />To put it simply: I adored this book. As soon as I read the synopsis I knew I would learn about a forgotten chapter in history. What I didn't know was that I would fall for the tale and the characters.<br /><br />Baker-Kline has crafted a wonderful novel involving not only the orphan trains of the late 1800s but also the foster care system of today. Orphan Train is a commentary on what happens to children without parents (or parents that are unable to care for their children) and a deeply moving story.<br /><br />The book moves seamlessly from Vivian's early life to Molly's current situation. Baker-Kline has done a faultless job of blending historical and modern elements. In my opinion that rarely happens in a book encompassing both historical and modern elements.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really liked the free app and I was so excited when I saw it as the free app of the day on the Amazon market. I use it every once in a while but it bugs my fiance so I usually just use it when I'm napping. It definitely helps me get better sleep though.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I live in Wisconsin, in the USA, and I wanted a Twyla doll more than anything. But I knew she was coming out in July here, and that she was currently only being sold in Canada and Europe. I ordered her on here for 40 dollars, and it said she would arrive in 18-26 business days, and that her approximate delivery date would be on July 1st. I was extremely happy and surprised when she came in the mail yesterday, 20 days before scheduled! She is an extremely unique doll, with her smokey marks on her hands and shins, her cute outfit, and if you hold her up to the light for a bit, her eyes glow in the dark! I am very pleased with the quick delivery and quality of the product!
030758836X|5.0|The only reason I had to continuously put this book down was because I needed a couple breathers.  It was exhausting, but in a good way.  There are so many twists and turns, my mind was constantly working trying to guess what was the next step this story was going to take!<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" begins with Nick waking up on his anniversary to find his wife missing.  It looks as if there was a struggle in the living room so he quickly calls the police.  As with any crime, those closest to the victim are looked at first, and the number 1 suspect is Nick.  The book rotates between Nicks POV and diary entries from Nick's wife Amy.  These entries really make the reader connect and grow close with Amy so that you really hope that we will somehow find her alive somewhere by the end of the book.<br /><br />There are other books that I have read that felt similar to this, but the writing was so good it surpassed anything I have read so far this year.  You will find yourself cheering and booing at characters, and not really knowing who to like in the end.  It is the conflicting character types that make this novel most enjoyable as their development really engages the reader.  Flynn slowly layers on more information as the story progresses, revealing traits that will change your view on each character multiple times.  One minute you will love them, the next hate them, and by the end you won't even know what to think.<br /><br />My dad also read this book and I think he would have docked a star for the ending.  I won't give too much away, but if you are okay with a book that leaves a little mystery at the end, or feels a little cutoff then you are fine.  I thought it was a perfect ending as throughout the book you are wondering what is going to happen next, that it is only right that you keep wondering even after you have finished.<br /><br />This book really made me think - as in rethink getting married!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy! It had everything. So sexy, sweet, and fun! It's a fast read.  I loved it :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am not a voracious reader - especially when it comes to fiction. Ready Player One was recommended to me by a friend who was designing a dystopian-themed board game. I reasoned that it would help me appreciate the theme of the game. I was in for a very pleasant surprise, as the book took me back to my childhood of the 1980's as well as to the future of virtual reality.<br /><br />Ernest Cline has painted a picture of what is not too far from possibility in the future. This is a book I will most likely re-read in the very near future - it was that good.
1882723007|5.0|This is the 3rd copy I have purchased! I loan it out and don't get it back! Very easy read, and helped me alot after the loss of my brother and my mother 4 moths later. It helped me understand so much of what I disn't.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|This app does take a little bit of getting used to, especially if you've never used the computer version. But it's great for my basic needs, which is mostly doodling when I get bored. Well organized app and lots of great features.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Can't wait to view the 2nd season! The acting and singing are top notch. Great storyline and Katharine McPhee is wonderful!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|But to be fair book two was hard to top.<br /><br />But because I love the series this book was still an enjoyable read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|people who buy this game your awesome and the game<br />is awesome it's simple do you get it it makes sence and every person put five stars for there review
B005LAIIFS|5.0|There really isn't anything I don't like about this film. The characters are a bit different than those in the books, but I think it compliments well with Joyce's wonderfully written series.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am so glad that I read the books before seeing this movie.  There are details and ideas that are explained well in the book. If you haven't read the book, you may not understand some of the scenes in the movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I put off seeing this movie for the longest time (despite my fiance asking to watch it for a couple months) and I wish I hadnt. It's so cute! It seemed like it would be too much of a kids movie but I really thought it was great for adults too. Especially for us old school gamers who like the nostalgia of it all.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|it's the original star trek. I watched it as a kid. still find it enjoyable as an adult. shatner is a rock.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Good app for Kindle Fire.  I think this app is equal to my PC.  I prefer the full html in Color view.
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Glad this finally came to Kindle Fire. Great pinball game for pinball and comic fans alike. Not sure why the install complaints from other reviewers. Have had zero problems with game. Just a heads-up that this game only comes with the Avengers table (a fun table) with others available for $1.99. Been having so much fun I've all ready bought a handful of the other tables and all have been excellent. Smooth playing and excellent graphics. Spider-Man, World War Hulk, Ghost Rider, and Wolverine being personal faves.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I was so afraid that a film version of my favorite book will turn out below my expectations. My worry for this lessened once I learned that the book's writer, Stephen Chbosky not only adapted his book into the screenplay, but was also directing, I worried a lot less. Rightfully so. This movie truly brought the book to life. The cast was just amazing. It's definately a movie that I'll watch over and over.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|\\"Man of Steel\\" has its fair share of talent, but with a potential to tell a truly epic tale, Zimmer shoots for the heavens. He gets there.
B008Y7G3JS|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. I can watch it over and over and the kindle edition delivers! It looks absolutely gorgeous on my Kindle Fire HD and now I can take it with me wherever I go. Such a good price for the HD version too!
B001S49AQW|5.0|So I am 29 and I think nobody my age reads heyer but they should. Best book ever ever ever
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Engaging beginning and griping end. Started to get a little hard to keep going during Noonien`s years of travel. Overall great book, no adventure.
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|The movie was good, however i was charged for what was to be a free digital download.<br />Didital downloads are not worth the worth a dime.<br />Every time i try from any source i have problems.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Still great after all these years.<br />Picture quality was very good.<br />Still laugh at the guy in the bathroom getting eaten.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun and great game. The only bad thing is that it gets a little boring after a while. That is why I gave this game four stars
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris relived his experiences and was very transparent. A great book by one of this Country's finest men.<br /><br />Semper Fi
B000K2IFPK|5.0|This is an urgent, unputdownable read. Exquisite writing, with another character of depth from the brilliant Chloe Thurlow. This is the fourth story I've read from her works and I'm becoming a huge fan.<br /><br />The reader is into the action from the very first word. Very soon you're yelling at Greta 'Don't do it' (I don't think I said it out loud, just silently), but of course, she does, and from that point you have to read on to find out what happens; forget everything else, don't eat, don't drink, don't sleep, just submerge yourself in this very sexy world. Great relishes every part of her adventure and you will too.<br /><br />Chloe is excellent at creating characters. They're all different and they have a depth which is skilfully revealed as the story progresses. This story is intense, the situations risky, exciting and dangerous but Greta is far from a victim as she relishes her journey.<br /><br />I think Chloe Thurlow is one of the best in the business. She never disappoints, her writing is truly excellent.  She's producing new classics, with longevity.<br /><br />Buy this (or get it for free - that's unbelievably good value because the worth of her prose is far higher - then buy everything else she's written.
B005FPT51K|4.0|It worked fine in the house, however, it took an Internet technician to get the networking to work outside the home. It is now working wonderfully. My son can actually view the nursery from Afghanistan, so for that we are so pleased.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It simply seemed like Harris was just tired of this series and wanted to wind it up, quick and simple.  The fact that vampires featured very little in the story contributed to the disappointment.  In previous books the way in which the author described the vampire characters was often amusing and fun.  Without them the story fell flat for me.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|This band is another favorite of mine,I have & like all their CD's ,you can not go wrong with it.
B004RL9T50|5.0|It was  fine, not stopping. I loved it a lot worked good!! It was pretty awesome product :) Would watch again
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Really loved this story. It has been a long time since a story made me cry, but it wasn't sappy at all. The characters did seem older than their years, but when faced with serious health issues it is not unrealistic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game because well it's just  fun and entertaining awesome app you have made here amazon lovely kindled too
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I chose this rating because...it's a dictionary! With That Been Said Its Boring, very boring!The only part I liked was the definition of sex!!!!!I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE UNLESS THEY WOULD LIKE TO DIE OF BOREDOM!
B0095ESTLO|2.0|I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because Jim Dale read it.  He's fabulous.  Because the dates kept jumping back and forth, listening to it was an ordeal, very confusing.  For example, in one chapter one character meets a girl of 11 and then later in the book, that same character was just being born.  Because this happened throughout the book, I finally had to go to the library and pick up the hard copy to get an idea of chronology.  Without the hard copy, I would have been totally lost.<br /><br />The book was filled with all sorts of elaborate descriptions of places and things.  It's too bad the author did not spend that much time on the characters or plot.  While listening to all the elaborate descriptions, i remember thinking about the hall of mystery in the ministry of magic in book 5 of Harry potter.  There the children saw many unusual and wondrous things.  The interest was generated for those items, not mainly because of them being so unusual but because we wondered what the characters would do with them.  Like for example when Ron was in the brain room.  We knew he'd get himself in trouble there because we Knew Ron.  And like Harry on the dais where the arch representing death stood.  Harry was mesmerized by it because he wanted to see his parents.  We were given some context of who the characters were so we were able to connect with the items.  In this book, there is none of that.  For 99% of the book, it's just run on descriptions of things and places.<br /><br />So, it was the human quality that was missing from this book.  All these fine descriptions with no one to connect them to which resulted in empty prose.  Flowery, &#34;magical,&#34; descriptive yet ultimately empty prose.<br /><br />But that's not all.  I trudged through the book hoping for some kind of payoff in the end, all for naught.  I wish I would have stopped when I got the first sense early on that this was leading nowhere.  I just finished the book and I can't say I have any idea of what itis about.  The main idea in the book was this &#34;game&#34; or challenge.  I have no idea what the point of the game was.  And in the end when those who died were listed, why was Tara not listed?<br /><br />It is a book filled with dead ends, needless description, confusion and no payoff.  Don't waste your time.  Poor Jim Dale did the best he could but even he could not save this horrible book.  I cannot begin to understand how it ever got so many good reviews.  If anyone could tell me what it is about, I would really appreciate that.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have all three seasons and can't wait for the next.  Great acting and drama.  Too bad there aren't more shows like this on tv.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Kids of all ages will enjoy &#34;The Goonies&#34;!  Grab the blankets, popcorn and turn out the lights for this great family movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE This Game I Have It On The Pc As Well And There Both Amazing And This App Runs Smoothly I Would Totally Recommend U Get This App P.S. To Anyone Complaining About Not Getting Updates Is That It Takes Some Time To Convert The Updates To Android Devices (kindle Included) So Just Be Patient!!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite singers.  His effortless voice and great interpretations are nothing but joy to listen to.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|It got stuck downloading at seven present. I was a big fan of angry birds until this one came out! Don't buy it!!!!!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I like the increasing loudness of the sound, but the actual sound quality and variety of sounds are lacking.  How about some real music?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Thoroughly challenging and fun game. Great mix of puzzle and mystery. I was very impressed with the beautiful graphics and how well it used the touch interface on my Kindle Fire.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|First, I'll say I haven't read the books. Second, I'll say rarely do I watch a TV series, cable or otherwise, but this show drew me in. For those that cringe at sex scenes and graphic gore, this show is not for you. Now for my review. The casting of the actors in their roles was excellent. The actors bring the characters to life. The plot, and intrigue it creates, keeps me hungry for the next episode, the equivalent of a page turner in book lingo. I streamed the first two episodes, because of the super long netflix wait, and then netflixed the rest. The information and extra features on the blueray disks is awesome. The details about the 7 kingdoms and the history all the way back to \\"The First Men\\", and \\"The children of the Forest\\" is great fiction. Going through all the extra information really helps connect all the plot twists and makes the storyline even more enjoyable. I've spent as much time watching the episodes as reading about the continents of Westeros and Essos. All of these things are what draws me into this Epic Series. In closing, I'll say that some of the sex scenes and gore are a little over the top, but everything I previously mentioned keeps me coming back for more.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|when asked my 8 year old granddaughter said she likes this game but wishes the people wrre easier to move and finds  the actions somewhat difficult to control. She does enjoy collecting the coins and buying items.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is fun but it is the same thing as the prom one.so it is a gigantic rip off that is so fun
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy the zen aspect of the puzzles, and I like the fact that you can undo the matches.  Also, I like the way the unworkable tiles can be darkened.  It helps make the workable ones easier to spot.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is so great you should get it. good too love it. the best game in a long shot
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book! So many characters and stories that all tie together. This is everything fantasy should be and more!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Sorry to say don't know much about this one. Both grandkids seem to enjoy although 6 year old expressed a lot of frustration trying to get through certain levels.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I don't like the ending of this book because they don't tell you what happens to Gale it is UN fair
0307593525|4.0|Great reference guide and the volume set is very attractive. I've also seen these set go for 2x as much in kitchen stores. Much better deal online!
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|Another fantastic, gripping novel by James Rollins. If you've been following the sigma force series you'll be pleased with this installment.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc. is well worth the money and can be played for a long time instead often minutes. Sometimes it's a bit creepy knowing all of humanity is doomed to your disposal but, it's still an overall great game and can be played for a long time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's fun to watch my dragons grow up. Visiting others dragons inspires me. Very cool. Colorful and pretty easy to use. I do get angry having to spend my earned money to clear land for more dragons. my kids enjoy watching the different dragons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So your chased by a detective and dog and you slide your finger right or left to move and try to get away. There's obstacles and trains you jump over all while collecting coins. It's like temple run except you don't have to tilt your device. TRUST ME GET THIS APP.  It's way cool.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There have been many reports of afterlife experiences, but I find this one particularly compelling because of Dr. Alexander's expertise in the field of brain function and his ability to distinguish between something that could have been generated in his own brain and a genuine experience of his soul separated from his physical body.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|i love this game, it is all about animals! and i LOVE animals this is like a real 3D world and it is AWESOME so yah.<br /> thanks from the viewer
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great and fun to play in. Best rpg I have ever played. Don't look any further for any great games, this game is really addicting.
1400067820|4.0|Just started reading this book.  Has a slightly humorous bent. Sort of points things are absurd.  Has me thinking about situations where I can embrace randomness.  Am looking forward to reading appendix and the more rigorous  parts.  I have to carry a dictionary with me to get definitions of some words used by the author.
0812993845|3.0|This one gets three stars because I laughed so hard I cried multiple times while reading it. That is the genius of Sophie Kinsella's writing. And it is certainly here in all its screwball comedy abundance. But. I won't be re-reading it like I will [[ASIN:0385342071 I've Got Your Number]]. I didn't fall in love with the characters as much as I wanted to, because they always zigged embarrassingly silly when they should have zagged genuinely empathetic. It was a close call at second, too. Part of the problem was what emotional resonance there was was invested in the \\"secondary\\" storyline. Lottie's sister Fliss and the irascible but real Lorcan repeatedly came close to stealing the show completely. And I, personally, would have been fine if they had. But Kinsella frustratingly avoided the depth that would have pushed this reader over from liking to loving. Overall, WEDDING NIGHT is worth a single read for the laughs alone, but a fairly forgettable one in the end.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love this game but I can't play because the game kicking me out would you tell me how to fix it
B00992CF6W|5.0|So cool there is a new updates for minecraft cake,spawns,and lava you should buy is 7$ is a good deal for an created and survival game you create and survive as
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|Wish the series had ended better. Love the Arthurian legend, and hoped for more for this final season of Merlin.
B0076DELIG|4.0|One of the best of the series. Good plot and tension in addition to passion and emotion Bosch displays. Very well written throughout
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I purchased the kindle from Best Buy. It wouldn't charge and Best Buy would do nothing but give me the runaround. I had purchased it April 4,2013. Piss Poor!!!<br />Contacted Amazon, they sent out new USB cord and charging block. Not once ( never got it) but twice, without charging me. One day shipping yeah.<br />Plug the Kindle up and Voile' it charged to capacity. Amazon you made my day. Raspberries to Best Buy!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Its been so long coming. Sanderson steps in to some huge shoes to bring the Wheel of Time to conclusion and does the series justice, potentially even leaving the door open?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the best games that I have ever played before. I love to play this game at home.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|A fun ride with way more clever story telling surprise scares and good acting, than body count.  I enjoyed my self and loved the way it kept me guessing.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The best book I've read all year. My take? If you want great things from life, you first have to do great things for others and take care of your health in the 4 spheres. It doesn't work the other way around
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game,challenging but not too difficult to solve.With a bit of lateral thinking I was able to solve the games.Looking forward to new levels.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Great series, great acting, would recommend to everyone with an interest in musicals. Can't wait to see more of this series
B008V8FVTI|5.0|The talent in this movie was just amazing!!! When you bring a cast like that together it's got to be amazing and I was not disappointed. Actually thinking about watching it again. Love, Love, Loved It!!!!!
B005VPRET4|5.0|Love these Lego set's for girls.  My daughter plays with these for hours at a time.  Expensive but well worth the cost.  Now she plays with her sets all together.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book is just right. Just a little off the beaten path. The magical power of books and the fun of exploration.
B00006AW2G|3.0|I agree with other reviews. Not the best SACD quality.  Lacks dynamic range and punch.  Just does not sound thick.  Listening on B&W loudspeakers.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|If you're traveling somewhere new there are so many reviews of anything you can think of on here.  Found lots of ideas for our trip and checked out hotels and restaurants- nice to know what other people think before you go somewhere.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It's one of the best virtual pianos I've ever encountered. It has a few bugs but they can be easily fixed. Overall I would definitely recommend this app
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Great family movie, clean, clever and funny.  Our six year old loved it and we enjoyed it too.  Love good family friendly movies.  They need to make more!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun once you get used to the rules. It takes a little time to get used to but worth the time.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I have bought the full modern Weaphones app and did not regret my purchase. It had plenty of fun weapons. This app is the same thing. These weapons are very historical and interesting to load and fire. My only complaint would be that there are only 6 or 7 weapons currently, however this app is pretty new, so there should be more updates. So far, i have not been disappointed by OriginalPlan. Keep doing what you're doing!
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|This album is definitely different than all previous Queens albums, but that's not a bad thing in this case.  Clockwork' has it all - It rocks and it cries while Homme puts soul in every tune.  The highlights for me are &#34;Kalopsia&#34;, &#34;Fairweather Friends&#34;, and &#34;I Appear Missing.&#34;  The only song that I find somewhat forgettable is &#34;Smooth Sailing&#34;, and it still has some pretty cool moments.<br /><br />To me, Era Vulgaris and Lullabies to Paralyze were Queens albums that helped pass the time, but just weren't on the level of their first three albums.  Clockwork', to me, is on the same level as the first three Queens albums.  Although, to make an album as good as Songs for the Deaf again, Homme would have to invite Oliveri back to help write the songs and music.
0374533571|4.0|I chose this rating because it was a phenomenal book. it follows the movie well. the reason i marked it off one star is that, while i know the book and the movie cant be exactly the same, there were major details left out of it. Of course, i am going off of the fact that i dont know which came first. The book or the movie.
0807208523|5.0|What a classic!  A must read for every child and parent.  Read by EB White he is a great reader.  I have listened to some books where they get the characters wrong.  EB White knows his characters and hearing him read makes the book even more alive!!!!  I highly recommend for those long car trips.
0783225857|4.0|I am a Gregory Peck fan. I didn't care for his politics. Peck was an excellent actor & had a unmistakable presence on screen.<br />Like all Peck films, this one is a great preformance.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|I'm a medical professional and I wish that this book were required reading for all medical professionals and others working in the sciences. It's an eye-opening look at how scientific data is misused and hidden from regulators and the public. We base so much of what we do on &#34;evidenced based medicine&#34; but it turns out that much of the evidence has been obscured. Ben Goldacre is a British MD which a talent for writing. This book isn't as humorous as his previous (Bad Science) but it's probably more important.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This was a very good movie. Has a good story line to it. My granddaughter loved it. She laughed a lot while watching.
B004IFD9HE|5.0|Great family movie.  Clean with some funny jokes the grown ups will get and the kids will not even notice.  I really love this movie and my dughter (6 years of age) love it too.
0470876417|5.0|Bought this book as a gift; the person really appreciates it and has used it as a guide to model his business plan.
1573223085|5.0|The ideas presented in this book have absolutely helped me to recognize the importance of exercising more r-directed thinking, or at the very least putting measures in to distract myself from applying l-directed thinking to everything, and to apply concepts like 'gestalt' and 'symphony' to other systems of ideas and habits that I've generated. I would advise anyone that would like to be a whole intellectual to consider this tome, pushing forward notions like 'context' (so often missed by strict logicians) and 'high concept', for their library.
0525953590|4.0|The book is well-written and easy to read even for a non-scientist. I would fault it for being too Newtonian. According to Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner in their book, Quantum Enigma, &#34;Every interpretation of quantum physics involves consciousness.&#34; I think Carroll's book would be vastly improved if he brought in the consciousness/observer issue. Doing so would make his book more personally relevant for general readers like myself.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy reading something like this but it kept my attention and I could not put it down!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Breathtaking opening scene, theme song (Adele!), great story line, a few twists, unbelievable cinematography.  Definitely worth a watch or three. :)
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|After seeing the new Gatsby that is in theaters now,  I wanted to see the one I had seen years ago.  I was comparing the two.<br />I still enjoy the Redford movie.  It was a splendid movie.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Arguably Roddenberry was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. I have learned more about science from his fiction than I ever learned in science class.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Let me say right away that I am fan, so if you imagine that there may be some bias about this film, you'll be right.  As much as I enjoy the work done by Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan I am, first and foremost, a fan of Superman the character.  Beyond the super powers and god like awe that surrounds the character, he is inherently a symbol for the potential good of the human race.  He represents the best of both his worlds and acts as a guide for others.  Superman is often referred to as the \\"constant boy scout\\".  It's easier to understand when you truly see the kind of temperament and control he exhibits on a nearly constant basis.  When faced with adversity how easy would it be for him to destroy his opponent in the blink of an eye, and yet he refrains from doing so.  He is a symbol for all that we can achieve, good and bad.  In some ways he is the embodiment of hope; hope for the future, hope for the world, and hope in our own personal lives.  So, when I say that I am a fan I mean to say that this film held high expectations for me and I am glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but exceeded them.<br /><br />It's difficult to compare comics and movies to one another.  They are different animals, and because of that, require different things.  For those of you who are fans of the comics it may be best to show that this film has an extremely similar vibe to the \\"Earth One\\" story presented a few years back.  It is a reboot that while fresh and rewarding for the casual viewer truly gives back to the fans.  It's worth mentioning that I believe a movie based on a comic book should remain faithful to its original material it also needs to separate itself and be its own thing.  Thankfully that is the case with the \\"Man of Steel\\".  The Nolan brothers' screenplay brought to life by Zack Snyder is a wonderful homage to past material while remaining original in its own way.  The very human aspect brought to the character removes some of the awe that may separate us from him and  witnessing the struggle he deals with in understanding his two sides is the needed heart thread that grounds the film.  The characters, most of which, are easily picked out by fans of the comics are played by some rather extraordinary actors and actresses.  You can tell by the quality of actors how serious Warner Bros. was about making this a legitimate project.  I could mention each one in particular and yet somehow I feel as though it doesn't do justice to the ensemble as a whole.  Each person fits their character in a natural way and one of the things that I found myself enjoying about the film is that not one person overshadows another, they are each a piece of the puzzle that fits well into the mold.<br /><br />Another important facet to any Zack Snyder film is the look and feel of the film.  While the film itself is grounded in many ways due to the wonderful cast it is hard to forget just how magnificent this movie looks at times.  While each shot is truly worthy of a movie still the action scenes are the stuff of legend.  Remember that awe I spoke of surrounding the character of Superman?  This is where it shines.  Snyder is able to envision Superman and his battles in a way that captures the eyes and truly keeps us glued to the screen.  The movie has a somber low tone visually, with most of the colors subdued, but when given the opportunity to for action the screen suddenly shines and explodes.  For much of the movie I had pure goosebumps traveling up and down my spine.  So, if there are any reservations you have about buying this film on blu-ray, get rid of those right now.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice buying it on another format. Thankfully, like the \\"Batman\\" trilogy Nolan is so well known for, there are a few moments among the drama and action for humor, so it's not a horribly dry film without levity.  Also, the amazing Hans Zimmer has lent his talents to this film and truly created a soundtrack befitting the movie.  I'dlike to point out that any time Hans Zimmer is part of a film I get a bit excited but when it was officially announced that he would do the score for this film I was eager to hear how he would pull it.  The movie moves seamlessly with each passing score and Zimmer's soundtrack only enhances the experience.<br /><br />In this day and age I know the idea of having two options available to customers is nice, in terms of DVD and blu-ray format, but in the case of \\"Man of Steel\\" I'd recommend that you buy the bundle pack.  Yes, you may not have a blu-ray player but if you ever decide to get it then you'll already have the blu-ray copy along with the DVD one.  Truth be told, I have a hard time recommending that this movie be bought solely on DVD cause it's simply too visual a movie to experience any other way than blu-ray.<br /><br />One of the best indicators I have for a film are the feelings I have the day afterwards.  I left my local theater following the midnight premiere and I had a hard time sleeping.  Almost a full day later I still have a sense of excitement over the movie.  This film has that something truly special.  It's not often I sit in a theater and feel like I'm taken back to being that same young kid who had aspirations of saving the world while wearing a cape (I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this).  It filled me with the awe and wonder of my childhood and left me inspired.  It's hard to imagine a better way to pay homage to the dreams of my past than letting them breath a little bit once more in the form of a movie.  I can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This young lady has more talent then a lot of singers today.  She has a Great voice and I would recommend this CD
B005K17RU0|5.0|In comparison to the &#34;Weather Channel&#34;  this has been great for me.  I travel quite often and find this &#34;Accu&#34; to suit my needs.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|It sounded after the 1st 3songs played that Joe was trying to get to techno/computer style writing. I prefer Joe grinding out his great mostly natural guitar sounds like on all of his albums the last 120-12 years, There's plenty to choose from that are much better than this particular album. Maybe it'll start growing on me though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have never had a problem with ordering on Amazon.  If I was not satisfied with my purchase, the return policy is very easy to do.
B004259BMM|5.0|What can you say about this men other then WOW.  This CD is GREAT and I would buy it again should something happen to this one.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|As much as I love Frank Sinatras Cds, I actually prefer his live CDs over his studio recordings. Most rock groups have released live CDs with mostly bad results. Most rock stars that have released live Cds rerecord the music in the studio before its released. Thats not the case with a Sinatra live Cd. This entire Cd shows how great of a singer  Frank Sinatra was. Every song is a winner. His version of Get Me To The Church On Time makes me wish that he would of recorded a Broadway Cd in his lifetime.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Every song in the album is really good, their last album in 2009 (Black Gives way to Blue) is also great.<br />Amazon always seems to have a pretty good price for the album. Plus I could hear the song right away on the amazon website.<br />Great! I'm very satisfied. Thanks You! Amazon and Alice in Chains.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This site has consistently been the best I've used. Love the reviews, pics and info provided. I travel a lot so I put the app on my phone. Great resource.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|one of the best movies j have seen in a while. wasnt filled full of bad language or sex scenes just to make up for lack of a good story line. had excellent characters and a realistic plot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|best television I have seen in a long time I will probably watch it again.I t is comedy and drama in one show.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|for me this is a GREAT FILM... If I could rated with more than 5 stars i would.... The love story is fantastic... I had to have it... that's way i decided to buy it and now i can watch it anytime...
006051065X|5.0|Eric Idol dies a masterful job reading this classic. I used it in my classroom. My 6th graders loved it. They followed along with their print books as the CD played. They wanted to stay even after the bell rang.
B006CHML4I|3.0|Really a lot smaller than I expected. almost looks like a woman's watch.<br />Read/reread the instructions and the Date could never be accurately set.<br />After maybe 4 times I gave up on the date being set correctly and because it's so small (Maybe I have big wrists?) I just don't wear it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. Enjoyed puzzles even though they weren't too difficult. Would recomend. Shame it didn't have more levels

B001P06GX4|5.0|Our kids (9 and 6) love and play it a lot. I love playing with them, too! Very happy with the game itself and the product quality.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|I buy the old stories that I grew up with so I can put them on when my granddaughter is with me.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Its fun, its easyish, and its pretty fast paced. What more could u want. Its worth checking out in my books.
B00D3V85FA|3.0|I won't bother going through a song-by-song review. This is a review of the release as a whole unit; the Deluxe version from BestBuy, which includes a \\"BestBuy Exclusive\\" track. Seriously... a retail \\"exclusive\\" track. That's lame. I wonder how many other retail \\"exclusive\\" tracks are gonna be released? Is there a \\"Target Exclusive\\" song? A \\"Walmart Exclusive\\" song? This \\"exclusive song\\" idea is ridiculous. Anyways...<br /><br />Overall I think this just OK. The group is tight. It sounds modern. But there isn't much \\"catchy\\" stuff, nothing really stands out to me. Glad I got it but after listening about 4 times, I'm over it. I'd listen to all previous Ozzy-era Sabbath albums 1000+ times over this one.<br /><br />Regarding the \\"Deluxe\\" version, the extra tracks are more of the same, i.e. nothing really stands out. Doesn't mean it's bad. Just OK in my book.<br /><br />If you like this release (OR NOT), check out Freedom Hawk (Hold On, Sunlight), and Orchid (Capricorn, Mouths of Madness). Those may just \\"wow\\" you. It's all about opinion I guess.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Really helps when doing carpentry. I used this app quite a bit when doing DIY projects around the house.<br />Most lumber measurements are still in inches and fractions of inches.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|James Franco acting and charisma carry much of this film.  Visually it can be stunning but at times the cgi is heavy handed.  What makes it interesting to watch is the development of the Wizard of Oz mythos.  If these are reasons to watch you won't be disappointed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book caught my interest right from the start.  Hard to believe there was a train that made stops at train stTion and gave children away.  &#34;How Awful&#34;.
0738737909|5.0|What a gorgeous deck, the more I work with it the more I like it. Erik Dunne has created a deck that follows the RWS tradition, but with some very unique visual interpretations. This deck is soon to be my go to deck when working with clients.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading all the reviews I was not sure I wanted to read this but I am so glad that I did. Yes there will be another book but I in no way feel like I was left hanging. Just another book to look forward to. I just hope I do not have to wait a year!!!
B0063M22QO|3.0|What was I thinking?! You get one of these tiny three-dimensional (sort of) games, using symbols you can't understand or distinguish from one another (my wife tells me they are Chinese words), and somehow you can still win! So, after \\"winning\\" for about four hours, it's 10:30 at night, I'm far behind on my other work, and my eyes are so cross-eyed that even my wife seems strangely unappealing as I climg into bed! The big flaws? Distinguishing between the labels, even though they are standard, and not including a health warning label for old soldiers, who are already on their second set of eyes. -Clay Lifto (author of [[ASIN:B00DG1RKI0 Only a Soldier Understands: Every GI's Reflections and Reminiscences of Military Life]]
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|Often time individuals do not know what to expect from their boss in the first 90 days of starting a new job or career.  This book helps to provide insight on how best to prepare for those unexpected expectations.  I highly recommend the book for those promoted to mid-level leadership and the novice individuals for personal career growth and development.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I thought that Tom Cruise seemed more mature in this MI sequel which made it much more enjoyable.  The effects are very good as well.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|My 9 year old son has been very excited about this game.  It ended up becoming what we would use for 'rewards' for him - good grades, extra chores, etc. - we would 'pay' him with gems.  Anyway, all was going well until about 2 weeks ago when he opened our Kindle Fire and the game was completely gone!!  He has been very disappointed every since.  I did reach out to Amazon and they refunded the gems, but had no solution for getting him back his parks or back to level 23.  I am hesitant to start this all over again as not only was there money invested, but there was also a lot of time and much disappointment.<br /><br />I have searched the internet and I see that others have had some challenges.  However, I have not found any 'official' notice anywhere from Amazon or Backflip Studios.<br /><br />Since my son is only 9, he does not have a Facebook account.  So, I don't believe his parks were being saved anywhere but on our Kindle.<br /><br />So, buyer beware.  And, if anyone has an information on why this happens or how to fix please let me know.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is the only charger I've found that can (through its 2.1 A output) keep my phone charged while playing Ingress in a car mount. The cheap-o cell phone carrier store chargers just couldn't keep up with the demands of playing Ingress. This one can do it and it is definitely worth the VERY reasonable price tag. Good work, Anker!
B005DOJ68K|4.0|I didn't want to buy it first since it would remind me that I'm getting older. But, every time I looked at the cd, it put those songs in my head and that was a great piece of history!
193700788X|1.0|I love the stakhouse series especially when she gets with Eric. I hate the last book, the storyline was so basic and unrealistic even for parnomal world. i would skip this book if i were you. I was pissed when i finished

B00CW665VI|5.0|this book was amazing. it was hilarious I literally laughed out loud in many parts of this book. it was romantic and sexy, hot and steamy. I Loved this book and I can already see myself rereading it again and again. the author should win a metal. good job Emma Chase

B003H6KRIE|5.0|I love these films even more as Blu rays, for all the reasons Blu rays are better than DVDs. Awesome
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game I play it on my computer all the time in my free time I absolutely am addicted to it
B009GENZ12|3.0|This is one of those love or hate movies that you either adore it or despise the concept. Unfortunately, I was in the latter category. I didn't despise watching it, and I loved the twist, but I couldn't understand why the suspense is taking so long until the very last minutes, when I realized the story is so controversial that they had to do it that way. If you have seen the movie, feel free to read my sympathetic opinion regarding why someone \\"sane\\" might've come up with such a story at the end of my mini-review.<br /><br />Other than the story, the suspense is really overkill. I was getting very tired towards the end. The ending didn't help either, and I ended up being more blue for a while. I read a few reviews here and there, and I realized it is a major theme regarding this movie ;)<br /><br />Third problem: despite the advertisements, this is NOT a \\"horror\\" movie. It is more of a thriller, maybe one of those psychological ones. So if you are looking for a good horror movie, you will end up with some regret.<br /><br />Despite all the problems, this movie has a good cast and great acting. The shots and camera work are made beautifully, and the setting is nice. Obviously the director has taken his time. If it was not because of the story and the long suspense, it could be a major hit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Engaging<br />- Interesting (first half)<br />- Great Acting<br />- Good Cast<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Long Suspense (seriously overkill)<br />- Controversial (not in a good way)<br />- Advertised As Horror (but it is thriller)<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br />Regarding the story, I think the only reason someone in the right mind would ever write such a story is grief. Remember Ann Rice wrote her Vampire Chronicles because of her daughter's leukemia? It is sad, but in sadness, some people find a great deal of imagination. It is always comforting for parents to think their lost child has a future far better than their worst imaginations.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love hoe you can be Tony and all his best sites I give this game an a+++++++ can't waste to get more sites iron man is so cool
B00CW665VI|5.0|The hot, self-centered mogul who makes no apologies for all his man whore ways.<br />The woman who plays hard ball with the big boys and makes no apologies for her set of cajones.<br />The humor, Emma Chase's writing style, the way she handles writing from a man's point of view...did I say the humor.<br />I roared with laughter in so many places.<br />Loved, loved, loved this!
1781162646|3.0|I've read most of King's books and have always enjoyed how he could weave a scary tale and at the same time build interesting characters, plus his dark humor appeals to me.<br /><br />In Joyland he tells a nice story that sort of plods along, making the reader read more and more pages, waiting for the scary parts.  I almost stopped reading the book just short of the halfway point but decided to give the second half a fair chance.  Yes, while there is some psychic play going on and a murder mystery, his version of the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew stories hints at a sinister ending, which there is but not until the very end.<br /><br />I'm still a fan but am hoping for more of the likes of 11/22/63 or The Stand.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My girls love playing this! They have a good time learning to play songs that they see the keys light up from memory.

B003204MQS|5.0|I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the acting and directing of this low budget film.  The series is great and I enjoyed each of them.
0425263924|3.0|seemed like a filler book and I was hoping it was the conclusion, but come to find out there is going to be another book. I'm starting to get bored of the repetitiveness of it and think it is time to just write the end. There is only so much drama these two can endure before I start rolling my eyes.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|A rollicking good time, especially if you like Vin Diesel. The rest of the series is similarly excellent. Highly recommended!
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Ever since &#34;Your Funeral/My Trial,&#34; I have found Nick Cave records that occasionally give apocalyptically bleak insights and harrowing emotional extremes, but rarely as completely the two properly joined, until this record. Consider, for example, &#34;Jubilee Street&#34;: &#34;There was a girl named Bee/ Who had a history but no past.&#34; Is there a more concise way of summoning both the indifference of society to the prostitute (&#34;history of&#34;) and the enigma of the female that Nick Cave has seen as a taboo quest throughout his records? Consider how &#34;Hannah Montanna does the African savana&#34; in &#34;Higgs-Boson Blues,&#34; where the entire clutter of science clashes against a generation of apathy and amnesia and an end of the world in loss of matter.<br /><br />The music on this record is in the background. There aren't the challenging shrieks or dynamic shifts that younger artists and younger listeners delight in, but the violence and the sneering, and the sympathy beneath the sneer, are all there anyway. This is the finest record from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in a long, long time, and it makes me feel alright about being an old punk. You know we real cool.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This was a great story about mental illness.  Told well and with respect.  It not only showed the patient point of view, but what the family goes through as well.
B005NK69ZC|4.0|this is a light book as far as content goes, but it's witty and funny.  It's a good  \\"in between\\" book to read.  You know, when you've just finished one with lots of plots and characters.

B003F44QRQ|4.0|&#34;The Lost Boys&#34; is one of my favorite movies, especially since my in-laws lived in Santa Cruz, CA (where the movie was actually filmed, although the fictitious name of Santa Carlos came close.) The boardwalk and surrounding areas always bring back memories of the many weekends and days spent in the area.
B008B11R2A|5.0|Last night I was lucky enough to see The xx perform live for the first time, and I have to say that this is one of those bands that you hear and like because they offer such amazing \\"relax\\" music.. but seeing this band LIVE is a whole new story. You fall in love. They take their relaxing tone and morph it into european electronic dance music while still staying completely true to their tantalizing lyrics and manage to not overpower them with beats.<br /><br />To me, the mark of an incredible band is when they sound better live than they do on a recording, and that is The xx.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this. Practical advice on customer service and employee retention that can be easily implemented by any company!

B0091REZMW|5.0|just starting out but seems like a fun I spy game. easy to learn. will kelp playing for now. more to come
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Loved it. Great way to pass the time. Use it every time I get a chance. Would definitely buy it.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|was looking forward to using this app from amazon on my poloriod  android tablet but  it wont install plus it took 3 attempts to download ..am very disappointed
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the best app around for e books, hundred of thousands of book titles to choose from and definitely the best one for free books with free titles changing every hour.

B008476HBM|4.0|Relaxing read. No big crises in this book. Enjoyed the style of writing. However, some of the sentence structure (typical for that era) was challenging.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was an easy read to pass the time, but the redundancy left the story bland and uneventful. Would recommend for a lazy rainy day.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This historical novel not only is a great read, but I've learned a great deal about WW 1. Follett has been able to show the reasoning behind the different countries for their actions in the war through the characters he's developed.
B00CS74W0C|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the Crossfire trilogy. However, Entwined with You was terrible. It was a slow read and felt that the author pushed that book. Honestly, I was hoping for something more since the publish date kept being pushed back. Also, the ending was left in limbo of a possible fourth book. (which wouldn't make it a trilogy anymore) If that's the case, I hope Sylvia Day goes back to the writing style of Bared to You and Reflected to You where there was much more suspense and heat rather than annoyance and redundancy in Entwined with You.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Lots of information, some sciency but the bottom line is always clear.  You are exactly what you eat.  I am halfway through my Whole30 and there are BIG changes going on.  No cravings, no deprivation and most importantly- no processed food.  This book will change the way you think and feel about what you eat.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Moving story bc it's based on true life. I would recommend seeing this movie.  It's a nutshell of what happened, a movie, not a documentary.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game  can't wait for another it wasn't too short and it was a bit challenging just how I like these games will definitely get the sequel
B008I43DYU|3.0|I tried to quickly divide 30 by .75 and got an answer to the first power. I was looking for 30.7 and got 3.7 p1. On one hand cool. On the other hand I was on the phone trying to figure out a page count. Wasn't in the mood to THEN do more math to figure it all out.
0786168765|5.0|Engrossing story that grabs the reader and never turns loose.  Just when I thought I could see what was coming next, it didn't, something more enthralling did.
B008Q00BOQ|3.0|This movie was okay.  I guess, I was expecting a bit more.  I love Tom Cruise movies with lots of action.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I gave it a five star rating because I don't normally lime historical fiction, but this book was amazing I read it in five hours! I recommend it for anyone who is in middle school or high school because it's a medium reading level. This book is superbly well written, and heartfelt.
1583334386|5.0|This is the best self-help book I've ever read. It was so well written and convincing that it motivated me to diet and exercise productively.  I shared it with my physician who recommends it to her patients with similar results.  The author, who teaches the course at Stanford University, explains, with the use of research studies, how we sabotage  ourselves  in our quest for will power.  As the reader becomes aware of the pitfalls, he can avoid them.<br />Sandi Black, MSW
B0037DGH4A|5.0|Good songs from Santana. He performs well. Good buy for Santana fans and people with latin in their souls. Well the cost.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've never been much of a Star Trek fan. I've always found Star Wars and Marvel comics to be much more enjoyable.<br />However, I do like this movie and have watched it several times already.
B008602KQI|5.0|The book, I believe, is better but the movie does a pretty great job, also. Definitely worth seeing. You should probably read the book first, though.
0807219908|4.0|Those poor Baudelaire orphans, their parents die in a tragic fire, and their luck just never seems to improve.<br /><br />The Bad Beginning is the first audiobook in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events series.  It is intended for younger readers, but I found it to be a charming story, and also amusing in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.<br /><br />There have been two audiobook releases of The Bad Beginning.  The one I listened to was narrated by actor Tim Curry, who did a fine job.  The second audiobook was performed by the stars of the film, Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, and Jude Law.  I would love to hear that one, I'm sure Jim Carrey would be hilarious as an audiobook narrator, and I always thought Jude Law would make a good narrator as well with his pleasant British accent.<br /><br />This version of the audiobook contains an interview between Leonard Marcus and Daniel Handler.  If you don't know, Daniel Handler is the real name of Lemony Snicket, and this was really an interview with himself, as he performed the parts of both Marcus and Handler, who claims to be Lemony Snicket's personal assistant.  The interview was amusing, in a stuffy, British sort of way.<br /><br />The Bad Beginning is a wonderful audiobook for the young, and the young at heart.  I got several good chuckles out of this one.<br /><br />LEMONY SNIPPET: I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but first impressions are often entirely wrong.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|Eric Clapton fans will be thrilled and amused at his change in style. He performs well and provides a new style. Good buy.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Don't befooled by the awful marketing done on the part of the production and distribution companies, this film is actually the first zombie film i've enjoyed in AGES, more so than Romero's 'Land of the Dead'! I definitely urge you to take a chance on a movie with a corny cover, and I assure you, you'll see a  clever, engaging, & cheese-factor free take on the undead genre.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie was brilliantly executed and is one of Woody Allen's comic greats. Owen Wilson really is a good comedic actor in the most sophisticated sense. This is one of those films if you connect to it emotionally and  graphically you can watch it over and over again (not too often)and it will always have the same effect:great entertainment!! The storyline is fun, the cinematography great including the lighting, and the plot development good. Most of all it is FUNNY and CLEVER!  With every joke, every nuance you once again recall why Woody Allen was and is so funny. This is great escapism and really the brilliant theme of the movie:\\"that each generation thinks the previous generation had it easier\\" is so simple but once again Allen had the genius to interpret this for us and bring it to life in a very well done and entertaining movie.
0736689117|2.0|\\"The Pelican Brief\\" is not my favorite John Grisham audiobook.  I like his stories about young, hot-shot lawyers going up against multi-million dollar insurance companies and things like that.  Instead, \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is about a law student who has to go on the run after inadvertently identifying the guilty parties in a high-profile assassination.  It's not a bad story idea, but I don't think Grisham pulled it off.<br /><br />The law student, Darby Shaw, is primarily interested in constitutional law, and therefore takes notice when two supreme court justices are murdered.  I can believe that.  Darby is not just smart, she is very smart, so she studies the cases that the two justices have ruled on recently, as well as cases that are coming up soon, and cross references that data with people who might want to change the outcomes of those cases.  She writes this all up in a report, one of her teachers hands it off to a friend of his who works for the FBI, and the next thing you know, the teacher is dead and Darby is running for her life.  This is the stuff that action-thrillers are made of, and I'm down with it.<br /><br />It's downhill from there.  Darby stays alive because the professional killers who took out two supreme court justices are too stupid to track her down.  Darby is smart so she does a lot of things right: she doesn't go home, she changes hotels every other day, buys new clothes just as frequently, and cuts and colors her hair.  Grisham explained that she has a lot of money from an inheritance, so that's okay, but she goes around using her credit cards, which any idiot would know not to do.  She eventually realizes her mistake and starts using cash, but drawing cash from a bank would leave a trail just as surely as using credit cards.  Still, the killers can't seem to find her.  At one point they are examining a photo of Darby sporting her new hairdo, and I couldn't help but wonder why they could shoot her with a camera so easily, but not with a gun.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe I'm just over-analyzing, but I don't like books where the hero stays alive only because the bad guys are stupid.  I've read a few John Grisham novels, and I know he can do better than this.<br /><br />I wasn't very impressed with Alexander Adams' narration of \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"  He left unusually long pauses between sentences, and he just never developed any kind of rhythm or flow.  The overall effect was a stilted and unnatural reading.  Adams does try to use different voices for the characters and I give him credit for that, but again, they just sound unnatural and awkward.  I looked around at Audible and found some different recordings of this audiobook, so I would recommend trying one with a different narrator.<br /><br />\\"The Pelican Brief\\" isn't a bad audiobook, but it's definitely not Grisham's best work.  Couple that with a mediocre narration and I would have to say try some of Grisham's other audiobooks before attempting this one.n.<br /><br />I dunno, maybe I'm just over-analyzing, but I don't like books where the hero stays alive only because the bad guys are stupid.

B00CISC2DA|5.0|I was skeptical. Who wouldn't be after so many years?  After my first listen (and several more thereafter), I am pleased to report that this is one of the duo's best albums. Here's the best way to describe it.  If their previous releases have honored the wonderment and nostalgia of childhood, 'Tomorrow's Harvest' embodies the melancholy of adolescence. No less meaningful, no less insightful, no less powerful.  I think, technically, the muse for this work is the American west, with themes of open spaces, loneliness, perhaps the mysteries of desert.  You may feel that, you may not.  Regardless, the release is different, yes, but in a way you will cherish.  Not to be missed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This an amazing app and it shows responsibility to young children who play it and think that they want a pet, they get to see how much work it goes into taking care of something. I really enjoy playing it myself and I didn't really think I would but I've been on here for quite some time now. Lol
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|My three bias are: I adore Venice, I adore Jolie's action films and I really like Johnny Depp. For me a win, win, win.  The director is one of the best, the extras you get with the DVD are really informative. I liked the storyline, the cinematography, the fashion, the intrigue, the views  of Venice.  It is modern romantic version of Robin Hood. The good hearted criminal wins and goes free and gets the beautiful lady. Entertainment yes: real life no. It is one of those movies that you WISH could be real.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the looks of this app. its utility is simple but fulfills<br />its stated purpose in a manner that is well worth its cost.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love games like this that you don't need WiFi to play!! Works great on long road trips. It's Awesome!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My 10 yr. old grandson loves it, he plays it a lot and I like it too, it's a lot of fun.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have not yet had a chance to watch this DVD, but I will as soon as possible.  WIth a few computer problems, it is hard to watch things that I want to enjoy.  Later I can redo this review, but for now, this will have to stand.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well the reason i gave the game 4 stars was because of all of the cons I'll show you<br /><br />Pro's<br />1:it's always fun to just hop on and build<br />2:It is much cheaper than the xbox version and pc version.<br />3:It had a multiplayer that was free<br />Some of the cons are that you can't get mods texture packs skins you can't play online and it barely ever updates it's only 1.7.1 now
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great for checking in on this, can be a little slow and not load but I would download it again if I need to.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is a nice quality case for the price. It has done well so far in protecting my kindle from toddler attacks and accidental falls. My son loves propping it up to watch his favorite movies when we travel. The only downfall is that I wish it was a little easier to turn the kindle once it is loaded in the case.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is an amazing drama about an English upper class family suffering the transition into the 1900s, going through World War I and so many of the other changes that were bringing everyone into the start of our modern times. The scenery and costumes are amazing, and this original UK Version is so rich and fascinating. Once you try watching, you will be hooked. Try to start at the beginning, though hopping from season to season is nice too because it is like putting a puzzle together.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoyed several MahJong match games on my PC before I obtained my Kindle, but never with this variety of patterns and difficulty.<br /><br />I can play if for hours, but wish there were more contrasts between the different tiles.  On a tiny Fire screen they can be hard on the eyes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Basically I can now bring my pinterest everywhere :) looks and acts amazing!!! I'd recommend to a anyone who asked :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show, tells a great story, acting is first rate,scenery terrific, can't wait for the next episode.  Thanks Masterpiece
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing was fantastic, the pace was consistent throughout. I highly recommend it to readers of this genre, or who've always been intimidated by similar books. This one is so good just as a story, that the technical stuff only supports it and gives it more color. Enjoy!
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I play Zen Pinball on PS3 and this is just as great. The free table that comes along with it is a lot of fun. If you haven't tried any of the marvel tables yet I would highly suggest those as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game  so fun and addicting on kindle the best idea because of the big screen on kindle
076115678X|3.0|I was expecting a little more on natural black hair, so I found this book to be a little disappointing.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|One of the many classics I have read, I love getting into the minds of writers from 'back in the day'. The way they use words to paint ideas and hold conversations is astounding. And for being a free download, and I happy with how accurate it is from physical book to digital.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has it all. Great graphics...Good story...challenging and interesting Mystery to solve. One of my favorite seek and find games. Big Fish has the best hidden objects games. Keep them coming....maybe a part two to this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. I liked it so much that I couldn't put it down . Read it is  great
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album is pretty fantastic. The first few initial clips I had heard didn't impress me much as did the advanced released title track. Luckily the title track is the weakest song on the album. The worst thing about this album is that it's a casualty of the loudness war, which has been mentioned in other reviews. There is some clipping going on. Not as bad as Metallica's Death Magnetic, but I think that was Lars' fault. Because, really, isn't everything?? I would have given this album 4.5 stars because of that, but they don't offer .5 stars. I've listened through it about 3x now. I say I didn't expect this album because Megadeth brings in a lot of different influences and styles into this album, which is something we're not used to. Another reviewer said it was Megadeth searching for another radio hit a la Cryptic Writings, Risk, and The World Needs a Hero. This is SOOOOOO far from the truth. They obviously don't know what constitutes a radio hit in this day and age. Others are claiming it's crap because it's not Rust in Peace or Peace Sells, and you know what, it doesn't need to be. Its been 20 years and things have changed. There is some great thrash in this album and some great metal and hard rock songs. Megadeth has always had variations of those three, especially since the reformation in The System Has Failed. I'm a big fan of this lineup. These guys keep inspiring me and raising the level every album. Of the Broderick Albums, this is better than Th1rt3en and more consistent than Endgame.<br /><br />Standout tracks: \\"Kingmaker\\" - HOLY CRAP! This alone is worth the purchase. As is \\"Dance in the Rain\\". \\"The Blackest Crow\\", \\"Off the Edge\\", \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" and \\"Cold Sweat\\".<br /><br />\\"Built for War\\" has great instrumentation but the vocals are really odd. \\"Burn!\\" reminds me of Disco Inferno for some reason, but is still great. But anyways, all the tracks are really strong on this album with the exception of the title track, \\"Super Collider\\". But that doesn't mean its terrible.<br /><br />The worst part of the album is the cover art, design, and band photos. Seriously, band photos are just horrible in general. Let me stand in front of a red brick wall in an alleyway and look tough. Or in this case, old trains (at least the promotional photos). Also, why would you need to wear a full facial WW1/WW2 era gas mask inside a particle accelerator??? And I don't think the Hadron Collider is a giant Vic transformer. But what do I know, I'm just a scientist. Album is 9/10.

B00004T9AS|5.0|I love all Oldfield's music, and this CD gives me exactly what I want for it. I recommended a lot.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I hope that eliminating wheat can do what the author says it does. I have a wheat belly and I don't drink beer I am also diabetic and watch what I eat but I am still 30 pounds overweight. I am going to try it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I found this album by sauntering through the new releases.  There are some insightful lyrics on this that made me cry the first couple times I listened (especially &#34;Demons&#34;), and I'm not a girly girl.  I'm an even bigger fan after seeing their YouTube video with the young cancer patient.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I like the way this is set up. You can sync documents currently on your computer to your Amazon Cloud Drive, and they are accessible through this app. It comes in handy if you have a great many documents and are hard-press to find one quickly (as opposed to searching individual files).
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I love this gerger's product. sincerely recommend it for everyday use. color and size are suitable. I recommended a lot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Its a very good story. You understand more things about them compare to the movie. The view about Charlie's problem it's so different. I just love it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little ponies. and this game is awesome to play I didn't expect it to be so fun. but it is and u should get this game.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|One of the many classics I have read, I love getting into the minds of writers from 'back in the day'. The way they use words to paint ideas and hold conversations is astounding. And for being a free download, and I happy with how accurate it is from physical book to digital.
B001JU4S44|3.0|This movie is filled with high production music, moving slow motion scenes, and silly stylistic moving camera angles.  Watching this movie in 2013, makes me think that they were trying too hard.  However, I remember when this movie came out that I loved it.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I enjoy this movie as an adult as much as when I was younger! There is a dark intelligent humor to it!
0525425772|5.0|Very life like family.  Enjoyed seeing good win out.  Explains some facts of law and a kid growing up and knows<br />what he wants to do in life.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Yay! A Bible app that comes with all sorts tid-bits for notes, bookmarks, reading plans, and even a verse of the day. However, I am not interested in an app that still requires me to follow on Facebook or Twitter, or to sign-up and sign-in every time I want to access a reading plan -- in other words, it requires internet access to be 100% usable. As I am not always in internet-accessible areas, this is not the app for me.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the Camel Club series!  I am a true fan of David Baldacci, and slowly working my way through all of his books.
1574214276|5.0|Enjoyed all the design aspects of Zentangle that can also be applied in painting compositions.<br />An eye-opener .....now I see the Zentangle method in so many fabrics, upholstery, lamp designs, etc.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Very fast recharge of my I phone, so I bought one for each of our cars and my work truck too

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The game is pretty good. Loved the first game and this one is pretty fun as well! Hope they continue the good work.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|We watched Oz last night expecting a magically wonderful experience, along the lines of the 1939 classic technicolor film The Wizard of Oz. But, alas, this prequel disappoints tremendously. the special effects were good but the story was poor and the acting felt contrived and lame. Too bad. I'm a big fan of the original Oz but will not be a fan of this lame version. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Not only for those who like the zombie movie genre, but also for anyone with a warm heart. Malchovich disappoints, though, which was also unexpected.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|One of the many classics I have read, I love getting into the minds of writers from 'back in the day'. The way they use words to paint ideas and hold conversations is astounding. And for being a free download, and I happy with how accurate it is from physical book to digital.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's a page turner. Of all the sci-fi venues I like time travel and parallel universe stories the best. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next so I did skip a few paragraphs at a time, and the story still held up. I'm going to go back and read it again more slowly so I can absorb the story better.<br /><br />Wish there was a sequel!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Wonderful book - I love the setting in So Pas and surrounding areas of where I grew up.  A must read for Reacher fans!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love it except.......there is only one thing. It should NOT take money to feed a animal , I mean, REALLY??!!?!?!?!?! 1324 dollars is a lot of money just for a pound of food, but every thing else I LOVE !!!!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|One of the many classics I have read, I love getting into the minds of writers from 'back in the day'. The way they use words to paint ideas and hold conversations is astounding. And for being a free download, and I happy with how accurate it is from physical book to digital.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Slow moving.  I don't even really like the character at all.  Didn't dig it at all.  Four more words needed.
B004UID2LC|3.0|But has problems, there doesn't seem to be any way to add to a created list. You can log into your account but you can't access any of your saved channels, favorites, etc. Many features just don't seem to be there yet but the options are. Tiresome to have to search for videos and it doesn't let you return to prior search results. Ads tend to be annoyingly in the way.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome once you get into it and you know what you are doing, you really get the hang of it and it is really fun.......just give the game some time to please you!!!!

B0086221SS|2.0|This movie started off well -- with good acting and cinematography.  The one ingredient missing -- a good script.  It wasn't a bad script, it just didn't really \\"wrap up\\" well.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|This film is visually stunning and has some great acting from everyone. I just wish I had read the book or had access to a manual when watching it, because that might have helped with comprehending the plotlines, which take place in different centuries and featuring the same actor in multiple roles.
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|Hands down his best album to date. Sounds great on vinyl with a good setup. Was delivered quick through Amazon Prime with no damage!

B00932A4XE|3.0|It was not my cup of tea, but others may enjoy it.  I thought it would have been better considering all of the stars that were in it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|After reading and loving &#34;the kite runner&#34; by the same author i found this story a hard act to follow. It is still a good read but it takes awhile for it all to come together. Be patient at the end it all makes sense.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Victor Hugo's novel is not only the source material for a popular musical but also the inspiration for every television series about a man on the run starting with The Fugitive in the 1960s. This is part of the cultural heritage of this novel and everyone should read this novel to take in Mr. Hugo's prose.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|When positioned horizontally, it starts to slowly slide flat little by little.  I have to put clips if I want it to stay up.  This one is okay if you're just using it as a cover, but if you need to use it as a stand, I'd recommend you go a different route. My husband bought a different case with ridges on the inside of the cover which keeps it from sliding and it works great.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I haven't used the software that much yet. I will work on it later to fully understand the software on my Kindle.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the all-time best basic cable dramas ever to hit the small screen. AMC hits a home-run here, doing an incredible job of bringing this world to life, especially for a limited-budget, basic cable show. Outstanding!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so fun! I could play it all day! I enjoy the challenge and the &quot;hard&quot; levels. Can't wait to see what they have next :) ;)
B000301YY8|5.0|This young man is one of the most creative people I've had the pleasure to listen to. He speaks of life as though he has lived it and he's not afraid to share those parts of him. He is a passionate man who doesn't appear to have much of a identity problem!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept my interest and had me thinking about the characters and plot even when I wasn't reading & that has not happened in a long time.  It had a lot of twist and turns that kept me second-guessing the direction of the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and plan on reading more by Gillian Flynn.
B00466H3F4|5.0|I saw this with the kids when it was first released, then recently ran across it here.  Beautifully executed and shot.  This goes down as one of my all-time favorites.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It works! You can opt out of the adware/spyware (which is for marketing purposes - not for Big Brother or Verizon to watch us). I have TrustGo Security installed, so it tells me what to do to opt out, which you only have to do once per device. If I had never installed any games that had adware/spyware, I would have really missed out on some fun games.
0061950726|4.0|Quite a juxtoposition between Nimah/Vivian and Molly.  Being of Irish decrent and having just returned from a trip to Ireland, visited<br />Galway and went through the village of Kinvara, the book really came alive.  Each immigrant has a unique story--not many are met with easy roads to travel.  I learned so much about a time in our history I had no idea existed.  Quick, easy read.
B00513F9Q6|5.0|Stunningly visual content. You can almost see the main character's paintings and the characters come alive. Reminds me of myself in a way, not an artist,  a painter.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|We love to put in this movie and have a night at the movies . Good time together with an action movie and lots of popcorn .
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|I was patiently waiting for this and just assumed it would be amazing.. Good rule of thumb: NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING... I am probably one of the biggest original Sabbath fans ever, but the truth is, this is way under par from what I expected. It's simple very easy stuff and nothing really exciting. It's almost boring. It starts out slow and so basic I can harldy stand waiting for it to get moving. Very disappointed in Iommi. The sound of Geezer's bass is better than any other recording of Sab though. That's probably the high point. But still just following Iommi's easy riffs. And Why didn't Bill Ward drum on this? WTH! I expected an epic album after all these years and it's a huge let down. I wont praise this just because it's Sabbath. It's not very good, and the riffs are so easy and simplistic it's pathetic! It does have remnents of things from the first two albums like the tolling bell at the end of the first cd, and the bongo drum they used in Planet Caraven in one song, and the harmonica.  The end of the first cd is cool. The last song is good enough though as it ends te way the first Sabbath album starts, with rain, thunder and the toling bell. Hey, and why TWO cd's for the deluxe addition? This could have easily all fit on one cd, hmmm a money grab... I just assume never heard this and would rather remember Sabbath from the old days.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game for kids.  They have been asking for the pocket edition and had to get it when it was on sale for 1/2 price.
B00BJNHACS|5.0|awesome game easy to play only bad thing is that you have to buy some of the cars but yes a very good game
B0083H6AQA|3.0|I didn't know anything about the movie until I saw it . I just saw Robert as a star in it . I was sure embarrassed by the whole movie and I can't sit and watch it  much . Robert is not as good in it  as he was in &#34;Twilight &#34;
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|This show is amazing. I have tried many different series but none grab you like Game of Thrones.<br />I can't wait for season 3!
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of my favorite books, already read it a few times. Would recommend to anyone who looks for a good SciFi;
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Picture quality on playback was not too good. Froze several times. And audio and picture were out of sync. Tried another show and it worked fine. Did not finish watching as a result.
B006PFC2S2|5.0|I remembered this movie from when I was a child.  You cannot, simply put, say anything bad about this film...yes, it's old, but it's awesome.  The music, plot, choreography....perfect!
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I actually enjoyed the Movie from beginning to end.<br />In my opinion it is quite funny.<br />There is always the chance that someone isn't pleased with some of the scenes and will down rate this Movie.<br />A review is and always will be the opinion of the reviewer.
1582701709|5.0|It is much like the movie but it's a reminder in my backpack. I recommended this book to my friends. I love it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's not real car racing stimulator. But driving this funny car is interesting. It's possible to upgrade your car: buy 4wd, good wheels, etc. I like to play this game. Try You too :)
B008QI6EHQ|4.0|I first read this book as a teenager back in 1969.  My dad had a yellowing copy of the book, and I read it in awe, wondering then, as now, how one man could be so twisted, yet brilliant enough to persuade millions of people to follow his ideology and that of the political party he represented.  His crimes against humanity were, and still are, hard to come to terms with.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|kinda funny, glad it was not a cruel on unsuspecting people like borat or bruno?  I like that he makes fun of &#34;them&#34; west haters...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWSOME! I Love it its better than loads of other games you should make another version of it a bit like subway surfer 2!!! :) x
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter loves this. Love the apparel before beauty styling. Recommends for girl who love spa and makeup. Go get it.
1594203334|5.0|I'll start by saying that I am extremely open minded when it comes to looking at the world from another culture's perspective. For this reason, I think I loved the book even more. It was extremely well written, laugh-out-loud funny at times, and a great comparison between mother's in France and America.<br /><br />I read a few of the reviews who rated this book 1-star, and realized most were due to the fact that they don't believe she's telling the truth and that parenting can't be this easy. But, I don't see the author's portrayal of parenting as easy, just easier than what we've fashioned here in the U.S.<br /><br />I must say that I've felt for a long time that some of our parenting styles that swing towards treating our kids as \\"Kings\\", as she would say, is a bit crazy. I loved hearing that this isn't a worldwide phenomena. I thought to myself more than once while reading the book - \\"I'm not crazy, I'm just American.\\"  We get sucked into group-think so easily and this helps shed some light on what else is possible as parents and especially mothers.<br /><br />Sure parenting isn't rosy, and even the French women always say there's no such thing as a perfect parent, but I do believe we've made parenting to be this monstrous task that's all consuming, sacrificing, and detrimental to our lives. We are guilt-ridden and trapped into constant comparisons. Personally, I'll be implementing many of these things with my own family --especially \\"The wait, the pause\\" and teaching autonomy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for moms and mother's-to-be. It'll give you a different perspective and make you aware that some of the crazy and neurotic things that happen on today's playground are simply a by-product of a culture that has a lot of fear and too high of expectations for what parenting should look like.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love  playing this game! It's easy to understand and the dragons are just so cool :) Highly recommended to all!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie was among one of the best I'd watched in quite some time. I realized at the time, that it had to be about Michael's life, and I was right. More power to him...
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Will Smith at his best. I used to work on an National laboratory and the movie show how things are done in real life.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I cant stop watching it.  Great show, lots of action and keeps your interest for a mostly unknown cast.  Can't wait to see more! Season 2 was a little slower than season 1 but still kept my interest.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I spend a lot of time traveling and need to travel light.  Having the Kindle App for my phone and my tablet allow me to leave my laptop and books at home.  This app has has saved me time, space in packing and is very easy to use.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Always enjoyed Judi Dench and hope to enjoy more of her shows, etc's. Hope
B001AT4Y84|5.0|Well, we saw the terminator sequel and every single time Arnold is his character, no less no more of what he needs to do
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I cant stop watching it.  Great show, lots of action and keeps your interest for a mostly unknown cast.  Can't wait to see more!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Babel...not one song is a let down...know them all by heart now!  I am truly inspired this is an amazing CD
B000FCK9D6|5.0|Another excellent read. I have long been a fan of Poirot mysteries and Agatha Christie's style of building her storyline.
B00BSO2U1Y|2.0|Bartoli and Jo are great..the idea is terrific, Osborn, Pertusi and the conductor are terrible.<br /><br />Your choice. I myself listened once, found it interesting then went and sold it for four dollars at a used cd store and bought a double cappuccino at a hip coffee shop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Challenging and fun. Graphics are good I could not stop playing. Can't wait for updates and new rooms good mind games with instructions.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Please come to AMERICA!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD, almost every song is great.  Great lyrics great music one word to describe it...AMAZING
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If I could stay up all night and read, I would've. So many twists. Great detail. The author is pure genius
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is amazing!  Thank you app developers!  I don't know how I managed my spreadsheets before I downloaded this app.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|it gives a challenge to you, which I like, but the bad side is it freezes up a lot but other than that is very fun! test it out yourself. I personally like it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love Sigh No More and bought this CD awhile ago have been braging about them for a few years now and am so excited to see them on the Radio STATES SIDE...Great CD
B009XIXVU6|5.0|From the moment you begin this beautiful story it captures your emotions and you don't want to put it down.<br />Hosseini manages always to weave an endearing story of deep love and tragedy, but always leaves you with the hope that enduring love instills. Loved it and was sad to finish it!
B0040JCJOC|5.0|This is just plain good. A dave matthews band classic. One of their best of all time. I like it
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great edge of your seat kind of read. It's one that you can't easily put down and walk away from.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|From start to finish, fantastic effort all around from these iconic God-Fathers of hard & heavy rock and roll! Not bad for 60 yr. old rock legends especially Tony Iommi and what he's had to endure for the last couple of years! After 2-3 listens/all 11 tracks rock Heaven & Hell like no other! Excellent, thunderous, hard & heavy riffs w./many superb, rocked out tempos to sink your teeth into! Next, add some resembled traits of previous classics gone by from Ozzy and other era's and you have one superior mix on your hands here! Great production by Rick Rubin! Great emphasis on the classic-day sounds cleverly combined with Sabbath's more refined/today's modern sounds!<br /><br />Yes, too bad no Bill Ward involvement, but Brad Wilk does a fantastic stand in on the kit for this entire effort! Thank you Tony, Geezer, and Ozzy for doing the album/long-time in the making! Until further notice, the legacy continues on and keeping the faith like usual! 3/4 of the Mk. 1 Black Sabbath line up can still deliver in 2013! Attention to die-hard and legacy fans all around/go get this one now!
B002KLOPF8|5.0|This is an outstanding movie that captures the mood of the times. The training was accurate and the war antics scenes were a compilation of real events.  Highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I initially had some issues with the game. I contacted customer service and they fixed the issue within a few days in a very satisfactory manner. I highly recommend this game. It is fun and easy to play, even without buying in app purchases.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|On lvl 3-1 you will die in the beginning no matter what you try so good luck finishing the game
B000005HBI|4.0|Her albums vary to an extent, but not a lot.<br />She is for the straight ahead jazz fan.<br />Great style and voice though that maintains a good mood.<br />I tend to like her better when she does more upbeat, syncopated tunes, which isn't often.<br />But she's an original. You hear her and you know it is her. That puts her in an elite group.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|If you have a few minutes to waste this for you. It's almost mind less just make sure you turn off the real money spending.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy jigsaw puzzles and was curious to see how they fit a puzzle game into a small space. I like that the pieces you have to place are facing the direction they need to go. They're pretty small on the side so it can be difficult to get your fingertip on the piece you want to pull over to the picture you're making. And it's difficult to make out their detail until they enlarge in the picture frame. But all in all it's a pleasant pastime, especially if you want something that's fairly quick.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|This is the first David Baldacci book I have tried, I figured I'd give one of his books a try considering I see his name a lot. I don't think I'll go back to trying to finish it, but I found it absurdly dramatic. And just plain cheesey. The way the author builds suspense is just stating over and over what the protagonist must do or the situation he is in. All of which is pretty obvious already. The writing style just feels absurd to me, and it clouds the plot and personally pulls me out of the storyline.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|During this movie it is revealed why the Iranians may hate us so much. We worked to overthrow the democratically elected leader and we put the Shah in his place. What were we thinking (as a country)? The rest of the story was very good. Regardless of why they (the Iranians) did it, this movie shows how shocking the embassy takeover was.

B000002GBJ|5.0|It's a pleasure, an opportunity to hear classical music and progressive music. Rick Wakeman is a true genius with synths.<br />With all the sounds that exist in the world today. I can not imagine the repercussion produced in the 70s.<br />Highly recommend this cd.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This is a funny take on martial arts movies.  Comical Villains, a repentant hero, and Kung Fu!  I love Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, movies but this is my favorite Kung Fu movie of all time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books keep you turning the pages and wanting to know what happens next, Its different enough from the movies that I would say its like a different story.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Another good book by Silvia, but again left hanging on when the next book will come out. Took forever for this one to come out and not looking forward to the wait for the next one. Not happy with this outcome...at all! At least tell us how long we have to wait for Pete's sake. Other than that, great book, lots of steamy sex, drama and omg images of Gideon in all the hot mess that he is. Please don't make us wait too long  Ms. Day, to find if there is a happily ever after for Gideon and Eva.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|I thought the book was going in one directions with a predictable conclusion. I was totally fooled by the ending. Great read a real page turner.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|thou i love angry birds there wasn't much of a change when it came to most of the updates. it seems like your playing the same levels except that now they have added theses power-ups that are stupid! just power-up the Birds,make them stronger.They don't hit as hard as they use to without the add-ons.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game.  I am so happy that I could get it on my Kindle.  Play it almost everyday.
B001CISHU4|4.0|Music was great. I still think this is one of their best albums. Gave four stars because the jewel case was broken in several places when I opened the package. The bubble wrap package it was in was fine and had no bubbles ruptured. No marks or creases on outer shipping package. This tells me it was pulled from stock broken and shipped that way....... NOT COOL
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I feel fantastic and also very versatile. The font size is great, as well as the division thus verses. It would be fantastic to have several traduccuones, eg Vulgate version, and the Jerusalem

1451648537|4.0|Get ready for a long adventure into the life of a contemporary world-changer. For good? For not-so good? The reader makes that judgement. As a 2-decade Mac addict, I enjoyed the telling of the development of the Mac as much as it&#34;s 'Daddy'.
B00BF11STU|3.0|It was well done but I expected something different. It's worth watching in that it portrays the difficulties of internal intrigue.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|I got the book because I am trying to learn about the use of light in 3-D modeling. The use of examples of what works and doesn't and the workman like text made it very readable and a great help.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|This book affected me more than The Kite Runner. Initially it felt a bit slow but it quickly became completely gripping.<br /><br />In spite of being fictional, I have no doubt as to it's authenticity where the lives of Afghan women are concerned. I am holding back on reading his latest book because I know it will be more of the same along a different story line. But you can't stop reading because you can't believe women and girls are destined to lead lives like this. I need to have the time put aside before getting it.

0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" is a story about a young man's will to survive against all odds.  The story of Piscine Patel (Pi Patel) begins when he is a young boy in Pondicherry, India and takes you across the ocean to Canada in the worst way imaginable.  The 227 day journey across the ocean with some interesting shipmates is gory at times, but lifts the reader's mood with some great moments between Pi and one of his guests... a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br /><br />Martel begins his story by introducing us to young Piscine Molitor Patel and his life with his family growing up.  Piscine invented his own nickname, Pi, when cruel kids at school called him \\"Pissing Patel.\\"  Pi's father is a successful zoo owner and this provides him with a unique relationship to exotic animals.  He learns about the animals and their mannerisms, which at the time he didn't know how beneficial this would be.  His father's zoo is where he meets his lifeboat companion, Richard Parker, a nearly 500 pound Bengal tiger.  Pi had a little bit of religious confusion growing up; he enjoyed several different belief systems and practiced all of them.  It is my belief that these religions helped in his survival.  Pi's father eventually sells the zoo and moves his family to Canada, but this would come at a huge cost.  During the trip aboard a Japanese cargo ship they encounter a storm at sea.  The boat capsizes and Pi finds himself in the middle of the ocean with some unique company.  Aboard the lifeboat with Pi was an Orangutan named Orange Juice, a wounded zebra, a hyena and of course Richard Parker.<br /><br />Martel's exposition sets up the main part of the story wonderfully with several details about the animals and Pi's life.  These details lay a solid foundation and provide the reader with a personal relationship to Pi, making his struggles meaningful.  Surviving for 227 days at sea is seemingly impossible and with animals being animals (doing what it takes to survive) it created a dangerous and trying journey for Pi.  After several days at sea, Pi is left alone with one animal, Richard Parker, and it is the one animal Pi feared the most.  The part of story with Richard Parker is intriguing, making the book very hard to put down.  Pi develops a plan to tame Richard Parker and after the tiger is somewhat tamed, they began to share a mutual respect for each other.  Each individual understood that they needed one another to survive and both are willing to accept that.  Pi develops efficient ways to collect water and food for him and Richard Parker and their journey together is nothing short of exciting all the way through.<br /><br />Shortly after land was found in Mexico, Pi is interviewed by two men from the company that owned the Japanese cargo ship.  Pi told them of his tragic, but exciting story and they refused to believe it.  Eventually Pi gives in and tells them a different story, one without the amazing tales of survival and near death experiences.  It is up to the reader now to believe which story is the truth.<br /><br />This book won the Man-Booker Prize in 2002 and was Yann Martel's fourth book.rous and trying journey for Pi.

0802473156|5.0|I decided to read this book from the reviews. I'm not married but found that this book can be even beneficial to single folks out there! It will help in any relationship you get in. I'm only halfway through so far but one thing he should add is what to do if you think you are all 5 love languages...?!
0679805273|5.0|I am using the book for my son's teachers.  I am sure the time will fly and I will be giving him the finished product.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I love comedies, but this was not one. The story dragged out over time and there weren't enough humorous parts to get me through to the next one. If you don't mind spending way too long between funny parts of a movie, then knock yourself out. I was extremely disappointed.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Love it! If you have Kids it's well worth it! If you like Stepbrothers John C. Reilly you will be entertained.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I had no idea there were modern day concentration camps that rival even the cruelty of Nazi Germany.  And 3 generations of prisoners. People born into the camp with no knowledge there was any different kind of life. These people must be helped and this travesty exposed.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Got this for my kids to give to there father who is stuck in the hospital. He loves all these movies and was too sick to go see it when it came out in the theatres. Hope he enjoys it as much as we did when we say it. One of the best Die Hard's.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|There were several parts of the movie that were action packed and the story moved quickly. The story line that was concocted proved to be intriguing and the computer graphics were well-used. Entertaining and NOT a waste of a couple of hours.
859037985X|4.0|I wanted a book to use as a reference for writing Lua when working with the Corona SDK. I had already explored the basics of Lua before buying this book, and wanted something to give me more insight into the language. In this respect, the book works well, and the basic language material is a quick read. Other parts of the book are often overly technical for people who aren't full-time software developers.<br /><br />I do wish that certain subjects had more examples. In the file I/O section, for example, there was no information on how to simply delete a file. In conjunction with web searches, this book works well, but it would be nice if it were a tad more thorough.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am completely addicted to The Crossfire Series. What a love story. They are a must read. I can't wait for book #4.
1476733953|4.0|I've never written a review before. But I enjoyed this book so much that I thought it only right to share my enjoyment. Especially in light of the news that the author reads all reviews. I wanted him to know how grateful I am that a] he wrote such an enjoyable read and b] that he offers the Kindle version at such a great price. I will likely end up buy a hard copy version for my library.<br /><br />One small quibble with the book. It seems with most books these days, we are still in the age of Hollywood endings. Where everything works out in the end. Rather than in the age of Shakespearean tragedies, or even Orwell's 1984....[semi spoiler alert]....about 3/4 of the way through the book I got the impression, even the fear that I was reading more of a tragedy than a everything-works-out-in-the-end book. Especially in light of the fact that half way through the book the author heavily references Romeo and Juliet. I saw this as a foreshadowing of things to come.<br /><br />The fear was refreshing in a way. Because deep down inside I wanted everything to work out and was afraid it wouldn't. I wanted the main characters to live happily ever after. So the fear created this tension inside of me. It added to the suspense of the book. But when I finally finished, I was slightly disappointed, because even though I want everything to work out, life is not always like that. And the way the book is written it made me want something different. Something that broke away from the Hollywood endings, and was true to itself. With all the foreshadowing, references to Shakespearean tragedies, it felt like the ending was a type of denial.<br /><br />Even with this minor quibble, I really enjoyed the book. In fact, as soon as I finished it, I bought the authors book Shift which continues the Silo Saga.<br /><br />So good work Hugh. Thank you for the enjoyable read.

B009NY43NY|5.0|C. Harris easily tops the charts as my all time favorite author!!! I've read the entire Sookie Stackhouse novel series right down to the short stories which includes Sookie and several other \\"Trueblood\\" characters! If you even just like \\"Trueblood\\" a little bit or if your more like me and you eat, sleep & Breathe the show completely then you MUST READ THIS SERIES! The books are even better than the show if that's at all possible! (And believe me, it is very very possible.... Even likely!!!) I just really hate that this is the final Sookie Stackhouse Novel!!! Ms. Harris.... Please keep the Sookie series going!!! I can't live w/o my Trueblood fix! I'm 110% ADDICTED :)
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I was so turned off by the neck crunching sound when the character died that I stopped using this game.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I've always enjoyed stories of &#34;dystopia&#34; - A Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, etc - because they make me think.  I don't know if the Hunger Games will be as predictive of our own times, but the film was an enjoyable immersion into a well-played story that leaves me wondering what will happen next.  Well worth the time spent watching.
0143122010|1.0|To think that violence has declined you must be evil.  In the past 100 years we have had Stalin, Pol Pot, Hitler. Now we have Princeton's Peter singer saying a 4 month old baby is not a person, and can be killed! More than 50 million abortions , including saline abortions which burn the baby to death since 73, not counting chemical abortions,. Every year 3.3 million reports of child abuse are made in the United States. 83 thousand rapes in 2012. Child molestations galore.
B00821OX98|5.0|trade in zombies for aliens. good show and worth catching up on. season 3 looking pretty interesting so far.  space warfare on planet earth.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Love the combo, love the story, arrived quite fast and was in perfect condition!<br />The story was almost along the line of the little mermaid, only with a fish with human facial features. The animation is superb and sometimes scary lol.<br /><br />the quality of the DVD is wonderful! I haven't watched the blu-ray yet cause i don't have a blu-ray play, will be getting one soon but i know it will be even better if possible than the DVD.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! Loved this book and everything about it. What a beautiful way  to express death and dying. I loved Hazel and Augustus. They were fun and witty. This book is beyond 5 stars.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|Just like others game is stuck at end of chapter six.  Really stinks  when you have to buy full version and you can not play the hole game.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this combo pack! the DVD has a bonus feature called music box where all the songs from the movie is at so you can listen to them over and over. I don't have a blu-ray player yet but i hope to get one soon so i haven't watched the blu-ray yet but the DVD is excellent. This classic movie is a must have in all movie collections!<br /><br />I love the blu-ray case it comes in as well. Brand new, not a speck of scratch or dust! Very classic indeed!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Are you looking for heavy metal?  Look no further, because this is as good as it gets! I have been waiting for this release for a long time and it was more then I hoped for.<br /><br />Track one comes on and we are transported back in time to the early 1970's.  The first 3 tracks are melt your speakers vintage Sabbath!!  These guys are all in their 60's now and rock as if they are still in their 20's.  They sound FANTASTIC!!  Ozzy has never sounded better, Tony Iommi's guitar is so dark and heavy and his solos will peel the paint off the wall.  Geezer's bass drives these songs as only Geezer could.  Brad Wilk's drumming is right on the money and I think he fit in perfectly.  Sorry Bill Ward did not play on this record.  He missed a great opportunity<br />to play on the best release of 2013!<br /><br />Track 8 ends with the thunder and church bells we all heard in the first Black Sabbath song they released off their first record. You hear some familiar sounds on 13 but it is the sound we all loved with their vintage Sabbath sound.  Buy the deluxe edition at Best Buy because the 4 bonus tracks also deliver some great music.<br /><br />So,if you grew up listening to Black Sabbath as I did in High School you have to buy this cd.  It is as good as any of the classic Sabbath albums. If you are just looking for some major Heavy Metal played by the pioneers of Metal look no further!  Hats off to Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Brad.  You have proven there still is some fantastic music to listen to. Buy this,and TURN UP THE VOLUME!!!!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I think the author does a great job incorporating real world ideas into a fictional book.  Awesome book. Get it!

B009XIXVU6|3.0|The storyline was great, as usual, except the ending tidied up much too neatly, I thought.  Downside was the cast of characters and timelines were very confusing.  Too much jumping around.  His writing is beautiful as always.  I loved his first two books much more.
B00004THAY|5.0|What can be said ..... awesome compilation of blues you will enjoy!  I was surprised at just how good Eric and Mr. King are together.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I clicked on the app under free and was charged 19.99 for it, not to mention that it is not real friendly to young children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really fun game for little kids to play if there bored and not doing anything. When I play it gets me distracted but that's the fun part because your not gonna get in between fights
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Entertaining Scifi classic to become a true CULT FILM A LITTLE SLOW IN THE START but by and by it draws you in and entertains as it assembles a team of fighters for a cause. Really liked it.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Good puzzle. Some parts challenging, some parts not so much. Nice balance.<br />WAY TOO SHORT or I'd have given it 5 stars.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is agreat movie actually even better than the LOTR.<br />Enjoyable and a real cinematic trease trove. yup yup yup.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Second great album from Hart and Bonamassa.  More electricity than in his guitar.  She is the only one that covers Aretha and get it right.
B002V6RB1C|4.0|This is a classic that is a must watch every few years. Paul Newman at his finest. &#34;What we have here is a failure to communicate&#34; one of the classic lines of all times. I used to use this with my grandson when he did something wrong.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Who are you?<br /><br />The Doctor.<br /><br />Doctor Who?<br /><br />Exactly..<br /><br />Doctor Who is so entertaining.  I don't know why I waited so long to start watching it.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Red Riding Hood is for the adult audience it is a mystery and suspenseful storyline that keeps you guessing all the way through.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Great sound and great songs. Best out in a long time. This one is well worth buying for any Hendrix fan.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|Great acting.  If you can stand watching the war carnage, you will see an excellent movie. Redmayne makes you believe in his  incredibly naive character.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This is a great FPS! I like how the controls are easily customizable. The graphics are very clear and colorful and it runs smooth. Highly recommend!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I loved this well cast movie. The great group of actors are into their characters completely. every nuance an interpretation of each amazing hero and yes they finally get it write this time with the best Hulk portrayal ever. Well done.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|These three dudes kill me in this one, as much as in the first Hangover[[ASIN:B002Q4VBPQ The Hangover (Rated Single-Disc Edition)]]. I'm waiting to see Hangover III -  if you like the first one, you will enjoy this one, too[[ASIN:B004EPZ06G The Hangover Part II (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]. The return of other characters from the first Hangover makes it funnier. By now everyone knows Cho or Chow \\"from the trunk\\" is in this one because they manage another Vegas in Thailand here. Allen does another tune for the situation, like his song for Doug in the first. I think both of the Hangovers were directed by Todd Phillips - so he with Brad Cooper, Zach Giafiniakis and Ed Helms work well together if they can make three movies on the same silly topic and come out with a good comedy that hasn't been killed by \\"sequel-ing\\". However predictable you might think this could be, they still make you laugh and surprise you.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My daughter and I loved this family flick. The movie is enjoyable for the whole family. I would recommend it!

B002SHD9E2|5.0|The intro to this movie is truly incredible.  It sets the stage, and right at the start sets the highest possible standard for the movie.  The scene where an old black and white photo comes to life catches your imagination immediately, and the scene with the chandelier should be the model for how special effects should be done.<br /><br />Throw in the music and it is an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />It lives up to the hype.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Downl;oaded by accident.  I did not read this. Amazon requires you to write x amt of words in order to get out of program, stupid!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had a little difficulty getting into the book, but once I persevered I was hooked.  I enjoyed the writing style with it's insights and descriptions as well as the story line.  There was a little suspended disbelief in finding a island floating in the Indian Ocean that was made up of carnivorous plants and supported thousands of mearcats as well.  However I have not ever floated nor traveled the vastness of the Indian Ocean, which is also part of the Pacific.  It still is a good read and well worth your time.  Follow it up with renting the video for fabulous photography.
1439181780|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It's probably the most inspirational book of it kind (of the ones I've read.)  Only one problem - it's a hardcover, but very poorly put together, and it started falling apart after less than a year, and has been impossible to glue back together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book.  The way the characters were interwoven and affect each other, will make you think about them for a long time.  This would make a great book club book.
B008476HBM|5.0|hadn't read this since High Scool.  Enjoyed it very much.<br />This requires 10 words or it won't let you out, stupid!!
0345803493|5.0|AWESOME, this story is a definite must read! Page turner from the start. I could not put these books down from the start.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|When I first saw this movie in theaters I knew right away that I would have to add it to my collection. It is such a good movie, I loved the actors and the storyline. I honestly can't think of anything that would've made it better. Definitely buy this one
B000002KYR|4.0|They are just one of my recent discoveries, and are marvelous. It is just what i wanted to listen. Delightful.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Very interesting show combines great Witt, techie nerds and a romantic twist.  I'm glad I finally decided to give it a watch.
B00352QISI|5.0|I don't understand why this movie was rated so low-- Pandorum has a great story line, killer ending, and really neat characters! Though much of the technology isn't explained, I still enjoyed the scenes, quality of imagery, and use of dark colors throughout. My imagination was left to wander over several of the devices, frame stories, and statements on humanity offered in the movie, which made this a particularly appealing movie for me. Overall, excellent movie.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This rapidly turned into one of my favorites. The difficulty is just right. There are points that you feel like banging your head against a wall, and then you have that moment of revelation that makes it feel rewarding. If you puzzle games, you have got to give this gem a go!
B004XWLN20|5.0|Knowing how much my husband loved Smallville, this was a Father's Day gift for him.  Nicely packaged.& just what he wanted!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|It was kind of weird in a freakishly twisted sort of way that my older children and I really enjoyed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is so addicting I love it except there are some glitches in the breeding cave but this game still desereves a five star rating
B008UX2UIO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I read it at least once a year. Ingatus Reilly is on of the most brilliantly written characters in modern day fiction. “I dust a bit...in addition, I am at the moment writing a lengthy indictment against our century. When my brain begins to reel from my literary labors, I make an occasional cheese dip. &#34;  This book always brings a smile to my face.
0575096616|1.0|I have completed the series and was so excited to read the final book because I thought the author would do a better job than the previous book.  I read it and it left me empty.<br /><br />I understand Sookie was never going to be a vampire or become immortal but to have her go out like this? It seemed that there was rush to finish this book so the plot became jumbled with Amelia's father and John G, Claude, Steven...it just didn't seem to go together.<br /><br />Sookie and Eric were not the same characters and it was not because they have evolved, they just were not the same.<br />Eric's character in the book was just non existent... there use to be passion, love, lust, anger, ferocity in Sookie and Eric's relationship and to end their story they way it did was disappointing...<br /><br />Sam needed a love interest but not Sookie, it should have been Kennedy or someone like that.<br /><br />The fae world should have been more in if Claude was suppose to be root of this vengeance of Sookie<br /><br />Sookie could have ended up with Alicide,Quinn, or even someone new... Sam just doesn't do it for me or the history of the books<br /><br />I just hope HBO doesn't follow suit on this ending and parallel it to the show..<br /><br />I hope the book that releases in October clears it up for me...
B00D6MJOAQ|4.0|Not a HUGE fan of Boards of Canada, but it still provides that good sound that you can put on while working and let the back of your mind listen to while you focus with the front. Occasionally it'll pull you out of your work-induced trance to induce a &#34;whoah&#34; kind of moment, but it's not DEMANDING of your full focus to enjoy it.<br /><br />They did a good job of keeping that kind of creepy sound to their music without overindulging it. Part of me was afraid that every track would be rife with weird crackly recordings of Branch Davidians or something like that, but they limited that kind of effect to a few tracks.<br /><br />I listened to the whole thing through headphones while reading A Feast for Crows last night, and if you'll embrace the fact that every song isn't explicitly &#34;The Rains of Castamere&#34; and let it provide a nonconventional soundtrack to your reading, it works out pretty well.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the style of Boards of Canada, you won't be disappointed with this release.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its an addictive game if you are looking for something to pass the time. I recommend this and is one of my top ten games on my phone.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriguez's lyrics are as true today as when he wrote them.  Found him when watching the documentary &#34;Looking for Sugarman&#34;.<br />What a wonderful true story of a man and his music.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I will never be without a swivel sweeper.  Can clean the floors in a small amount of time.  Even though it is not a vacuum, I use on my carpets also on the days I don't feel like dragging out the big vacuum -- It does a decent job.
1591843065|5.0|I'm happy. I got it early! Thank you for your dependability. I would use you again in a second. I am enjoying the book tremendously.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Another one of your great work,s. Well researched and written,, will look forward to more from this author. Good job
B0097HSS4M|4.0|The only complaint I have  is that when you try to share a photo to this app it won't share. And I had to get a whole other photo editor app to do  that so.... Yeah.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Love the animations though it is just a blocky game. I wish that there could be more frequent updates and have more stuff like the pc minecraft and Xbox minecraft.
1892005034|5.0|I'm happy. I got it early! Thank you for your dependability. I would use you again in a second. I am enjoying the book tremendously.
B008OOYALE|5.0|AWESOMELY EPIC!!!!!!<br /><br />You should really buy this app!! It's SO cool! So here's a way to put it shortly : I LIVE THIS GAME!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Was a little tedious, as the main character, Pat's behavior was so repetitive.  But the characters developed more depth and the story became more interesting about two thirds of the way through the book.  Would like to see the movie.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Too expensive. Why pay for a service when there is plenty of free social media out there? You can't do anything without forking over the dough.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Suzanna Collins weaves a great, original story with the Hunger Games trilogy.  The first book captures the reader and leaves you wanting more.  The storyline in the second and third books could have been shortened and combined into one great book.  Instead Collins drags out the story with endless hand-wringing as the main characters wrestle with their decisions.  Although I loved the story overall, I found the writing tedious by the end of the third book.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|Excellent ítem and good price
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a pretty cool game. It has its glitches but nothing that makes me not want to play. Good storyline and cool troop and building types. Definitely recommend this game
0767836324|5.0|This is a very fun version of Peter pan that anyone can enjoy. It is worth the money to get.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|As the prequel to Star Trek the original series it does a great job. It shows things like &#34;phasers&#34; in their initial state of development as well as the Transporter system being feared by most of the crew. It shows the Tricorders in their initial development as being somewhat bulky too. Plus it does a good job with the relationship between Vulcans and Humans when they first got to know each other. It also demonstrates how the relationship between the Captain and the crew develops over time. The episodes are all very interesting as well just with their particular situations as the Starship goes through space in an unknown Universe.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Excellent ítem and good price
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Again this is addicting and its super fun to be running in a hard spot and beating it.... I know when I beat my previous score or an opponents score I feel accomplished
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|This is a great CD for all.  My kids love it, I enjoy it and I would give it as a gift to my grandma even.  Definitely worth the money.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Loved this book. Funny at times and maddening, at others because the attitudes and sentiments revealed in the book are still with us today.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Julianna Margulies, which is why I started watching the show in the First place. Followed her from ER to this show and what a smooth transition. Margulies completely owns this character( Alicia Florrick) and the supporting cast is fantastic.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked without a hitch with Windows 7 Pro! Driver worked as promised and very simple to use. I have no reservations recommending this to anyone.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a great CD for both young and old.  I bought it for myself but would give it to my grandma and she would enjoy it too. My kids love to listen to it and ask to often.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This book was just as good if not better than the 1st one. The characters stayed true and new ones were interesting full of  twists and turns.
B000O77RLE|5.0|This movie was done about the letters that the Japanese wrote while the US soldiers were bering doing on them. Mr. Eastwood does a great job with the stories and filming. I highly recommend viewing of this film.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I enjoyed the book as a kid. I like the adventure the young man gets to enjoy and grow in. I also didn't realize how much I forgot from the last time I read it.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|We loved it!! It was intriguing!!!  I could watch it over and over and always discover something new!!!  Great movie!!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Once I got my head around the characters found I could not put it down as I was enthralled with the story line.<br />Then I brought the DVD it kept fairly well to the book. Great Read
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Very well done and filmed. Great actor and filming with a good story that is easy to follow. I suggest watching the film with somebody.
B0041D843M|5.0|Wonderful information for everybody.. How can we take this message viral, so that everybody has this simple understanding for good health? This book is an excellent source of information on healthy eating... No quick diet scheme here, just simple instruction for selecting food that contributes to good health.<br />A must read for anyone who has had any major health issues such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, cholesterol, osteoporosis.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is the best hidden object game! Beautiful graphics. It's one of the more interesting story lines. Two thumbs up!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|The storyline was very suspenceful & intriguing. It had a great cast of character actors; well assembled & used! I would highly recommend this picture for your viewing enjoyment! Be ready to ride the excitement rollercoaster!
B0013ND36G|5.0|This is a great too. I own them all as you can see from my reviews. I have been in a very bad accident so one of the things I really enjoy are great, fun movies. This is one of 'em. Arnold is great, the film is good. Great story, special effects, and filming. The blu ray is the best.
0316789798|5.0|I had this book when I as a kid, It helped me to decide on being an artist... so I bought it for my kids...
B002PEP4C8|4.0|I found this account of a personal event both spellbinding and difficult.  I couldn't help but think that police and some of the politicians in Washington should be required to read it.  Perhaps it would allow them to understand from a female victim's account the suffering over a lifetime of an act of violence seemingly so misunderstood by most men..
B006AZZPCM|5.0|grand-daughter loves it!! if you need an app to view you tube, this would be the one.  I give it my approval
B000PMG16U|5.0|It would be difficult to beat the films of all the Star Wars flicks. I saw the first film released in the theater way back when. These are all films that will be copied in more films coming up for years.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Fun adventure. Exciting with a sense of heroism that inspires those who are brave at heart. The mix of real and animation are evident and can be a bit distracting. Quality of product, timely delivery and unparalleled customer service. All readily recognized traits of Amazon.com. I buy EVERYTHING from Amazon!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Peter Falk was an entertainment icon in every medium, but he hit his finest stride with the Columbo role.  It was him - he was it.  Okay, the series was a bit formulaic, but that was the payoff, the Perry Mason moment where the villain admits his wrongdoing because Pete has him boxed in, in front of either everyone involved or enough cops to make it stick.  If you've never seen Columbo buy this set and set aside a week to watch them end to end.  It'll be worth it, I guarantee it!
B008N1V11U|5.0|It is better then iron man game the only thing was how to get out of the bat. U had to think. How you were going move in the game
B000JSI7C6|3.0|A great story of how the USA brought in Native American to speak there own language when radioing orders so they could not be translated. I am part Sioux Indian, nor Navajo, but I do understand what is was like and still can be for Native Americans. I won't go into that but this tells how this country owes so much to any Native American for all they have to contribute to this countries world standing.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is pretty much the standard low cost cooler. The picture is misleading as it only comes with one fan. Plenty of bracket options.<br /><br />One note is that all installations will require a back plate - which means most folks will need to remove their motherboard to install this properly.
B00BHUB11Y|4.0|duh of course it's good its Oscar and Disney . we will watch it over an  over and over again!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app and the dragons hybrids in it! I recommend this game for everyone.<br />It takes a while for some things, but I give this ap 5 stars.
B001FB55I0|5.0|All T-films are great to watch, but I love all sci-fi and have since I was a kid. I had to love Arnold in the early movies. Filming is great, special effects are great. Christian Bale is a great actor and so is everyone else.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much. It does get hard but that keeps it interesting. I've gotten on my Kindle Fire, Ipad and Iphone (I might be a bit addicted). It might not be for everyone but it's my favorite game to date.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Hey, it's Phil Collins of Genesis on his own and proving he is a rock & roll phenom. This is a great set of songs. If you like Collins like I do you'll have no problem enjoying this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i play it every day best game ever best game  ever best game ever best game ever best game ever best game ever but wheres the update its out for iphone pod ect
B000UJ48UO|5.0|This is a classic film that brings in great actors and one that wasn't even an actor that earned a great part. The gentleman that play the drill sergeant was not an actor they originally hired. He was an advisor from the military to treat the actors as if they were in boot camp and he was so good, they gave him the part. I suggest you watch this and know there will be violence and a great story.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is an excellent book - mainly because it is so hard to believe it is true. A remarkable young man to endure what he has. Sometimes I found myself wondering is this true? - and found that his story is truly believable. What do we know of North Korea - we have heard the stories of horror. One of many horror stories that litter our history. The world must know and understand what North Korea is and must not stand by any more.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Lianne is an awesomely talented singer. I don't know why her music is not more popular on radio stations, except to say that since most stations play pretty much 'garbage', people just don't know good music when they hear it. Definitely great music. I look forward to hearing more from this artist!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved the first book and was very excited to get my hands on the second. The elite was very good and I devoured it. However I found at times it depths and sometimes events were rushed over and not fully explained. A very fun, light summer read, perfect for beach days and rainy days alike!
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|I have seen all Hangover films and and had a Hangover more than once. Many funny scenes and actors, so you will enjoy it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Love Gideon and Eva can't wait for the next book. This book was written in a great way. Love it
B0094WK9EC|5.0|Amazeballs sound throughout this disc.<br />I highly like listening to these collaborations with other musicians and DJs.<br />I need to buy copies to give away.<br />Spread the vibe.
0679805273|5.0|I love the message in this book! It's great for kids and adults! It's encouraging while being realistic. Yes, you can go far and be great...except when you are not. Love it!
B00AEBB9O6|4.0|This is a very well done film that tells what it was like for people that were left at home when soldiers were called up and sent to Vietnam. It is a very well done story and acted very well, shot very well, casted very well. If you were around during any of that era, I do recommend it.
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|My grandaughter was thrilled with the Birthday Wishes Barbie Doll. She collects many of the barbie dolls.  Will continue to buy them.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Great movie! At first, the movie starts off in black and white and is a smaller picture; however, don't be discouraged since as soon as he reaches Oz, the beauty and screen size dramatically increase!! Great Disney movie and would highly recommend to see!!!
