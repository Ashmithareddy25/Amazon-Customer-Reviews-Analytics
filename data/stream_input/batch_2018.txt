B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a beautiful story so richly illustrated by the artist that is a Christmas classic.<br />A personal favorite I love to share.
B005IQZB14|5.0|1. Couldn't stop reading it (well written with picturesque discriptions, cried about Lady being put down)<br />2. I would reccomend it to anyone with the  exception  of a person who  dislikes swear words
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I want to read this book. I saw the movie and have never gotten around to read the book. I need to.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Interesting concept, happiness first in all things and success will follow.  Very true.  A good book to get people back on the right track - especially the baby boomers who grew up with the philosophy work first, play later.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who needs to get out of the old rut and start achieving without fear of making mistakes or simply to live life happily every day!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can you say on these books? I did read all three. I sometimes wish I had not, since there is NO MAN alive that could ever be like Christian Grey. The one I knew was close, but not quite.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I gave it 5 stars for writing style,  it arounses your emotions, as well as offering  thought provoking life lessons.  Anyone would enjoy this book.
0062082353|5.0|I bought this for my husband, who was a Viet Nam Veteran in the Navy, and when he read it, he said it was one of the best books he had ever read. He does not read books, as a rule, so I know it had to be GREAT!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Book is phenomenal goes very deep into his relationships, and what made him the president and leader that he was. Highly recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this first book...thinking I knew all I had to know about sex. NOT! I have never read anything, or gone to places in my head, like I did with this book. Whew!
B006O6FK2W|1.0|I bought 3 of them and none worked. The mechanism that was supposed to shoot batman off the vehicle did not work in any of them. They were presents to my nephews and I could not take them back to return them. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is great. As with any game there are a few bugs and some things that could be improved upon. But for free its well worth the download!
0446554995|4.0|I have read all of the &#34;Pendergast&#34; books from Preston and Child. This one is good, but not great like some of the first few in the series, such as, &#34;Cabinet of Curiosities&#34;, or &#34;Still Life With Crows&#34;. It is impossible for the authors to hit that 'high' perfectly with every book. I recommend it to young adult to mature readers. It is pretty violent but no explicit sex, (which I will not read). The stories are very intricate and this one contains a couple of sub-story lines that have been added to keep those characters alive, I think. It is not the tight and flawless narrative it is in the beginning Pendergast books. I still look forward to the next one.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Very funny movie! Would highly recommend it for anyone! Great for a gift or just to have a good laugh!! :)
1451695195|4.0|The book is very interesting and has merit. It is a true story and written with a professional author's help. I was intrigued by the Doctor's experience and believe his experience is true. He does repeat portions of the tale more than once and I'm not sure why. Anyone interested in &#34;life-after-death&#34;, or &#34;near-death&#34; experiences would want to read this one. He's the only Neurosurgeon thus far to share the experience from an &#34;expert&#34; point of view, and it is compelling evidence.
0385344228|3.0|This was a fabulous read. I would have given it a 3.5 if there was one. There was so much right, and so much wrong about this book, but overall it was a good, solid read. What was right was the character development (honestly, you could picture every character in the book), attention to detail and story line. Moved along. Kept your attention. What was wrong was the description of Jacob. Every character was so well developed, that it was glaringly obvious that Jacob never had a voice in the book. You never knew what he was thinking; other than his best friend testifying in the book you never even had much of a glimpse into his psyche. His parents, who kept insisting their lives revolved around him and professing their undying love for him had no idea who he was. So, although a brilliant read, there was a nagging feeling throughout the book that something wasn't quite right. I identified with his father completely though the book, the emotions as a parent were raw and spot-on. Well done, would read him again.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all DeMille's books and have enjoyed each one.  The Panther was no exception.  Not only is it a page turner and great story, but it is laugh out loud funny.  A great combination of suspense and humor.

B00AA7O22U|3.0|If you like seeing things blown up and a lot of gunfire, this is your movie.  The plot is so thin as to be non-existant, but hey, what did you expect and the orginal &#34;Expendables&#34;?

B00ADS98FC|5.0|My daughter had been after me for months (if not close to a year) to watch this movie. Not having seen the previews I delayed. Wow! I should have listened sooner. This is a fast favorite that is well done and appropriate for young teens to see. A delightful film we've watched over and over again.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|The idea is really cool. I installed it and now i'm watching the content on the smart TV. It was about time to get rid of the tons of cables. ...and there is no need of waiving like an i*iot to the TV, so that to increase the volume.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a series that has amazing writers and makes me look forward to purchasing the next episode on my kindle fire. The cast and crew have done a brilliant job as well.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Beautiful, classic novel.  Well worth the time to read it for those who love classic literature, which I do.  There is a good reason these books stand the test of time.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is a favorite that my children come back to watch even as teens. This one is a soon to buy for my Kindle.
0812993292|4.0|Have you ever wanted to do something out of character?  Well, Harold Fry makes like Nike and just does it.  The reason for his pilgrimage has one underlying cause but many twists, turns, hills, and valleys occur before he realizes what he is looking for. Rachel Joyce's first novel does everything it should bringing out empathy, sympathy, and all sorts of emotions for the characters. \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" is a wonderful read.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Brilliantly written, masterfully performed and profoundly developed as a whole. Every aspect of this show produces a fun break from the day to day.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. It's so much fun. There's only one problem. You can't make your character! Why would they do that ?!
0425252868|5.0|A great, easy read regarding foes who briefly meet during battle and eventually become friends.  This is a unique story, as it skillfully focuses on a rare viewpoint that war isn't always good vs evil.  Both sides of war can have good and bad individuals.  Each person does not necessarily loose there values and morals due to his or her country's political or ethical agenda.  I'm highly recommending to both my German and US friends!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It kept me always interested in what would happen next. And the story is sad and different from any love story I've read. It has action fiction and romance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book actually surprised me. I went in thinking this story was going to be horribly cliche'd and predictable. But in actuality, it had so many plot twists and it keeps you drawn in until the very end. Hopeless is definitely a must read! You won't be disappointed.

B006LSZECO|1.0|The characters were initially boring and dumb and then descended into being outright evil to amazingly sly and foolish.<br />The first half of this book dragged and the second half dumped the reader into the filth of some awful people's minds.<br />Cannot understand the appeal on this one.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You cant start with this one oh no you need all of them.<br />Very additive. I had it on my phone. but deleted it.Now have ALL of them on the kindle fire.somewhat harder to control. It is very epic so simple but epic.Touch or tilt controls are accessible and any of them comes in lite or free version so you don't have to buy it.

B0054LJGWS|5.0|Funny, truthful, and even heartfelt, Good Omens is quite possibly the most quotable book in existence. Where else would you get the Antichrist, a hellhound named Dog, the friendship between an angel and a demon, clever footnotes, Atlantis, and Freddie Mercury all in one book? Well written and captivating, Good Omens keeps you turning the page, laughing and wondering who will win in the battle between heaven and he'll, or if it is all ineffable anyway.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|Still as good a read as it was in the past. A must read if you have never read this.
B004SIP9P6|4.0|\\"Scream 3″ for some reason has always been the black sheep of the \\"Scream\\" family. Maybe the fact that Kevin WIlliamson bowed out of writing early on left fans filled with dismay. Truth be told, it isn't very scary and the comedy is played quite broadly as opposed to the satire so brilliantly constructed by the first two installment. But..the question remains...is \\"Scream 3″ really THAT bad or is there some hidden gold behind its rough exterior.<br /><br />The film begins with Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), by called by Ghostface (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) demanding the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who has gone into seclusion since the events of Scream 2. He refuses and both Cotton and his girlfriend Christine (Kelly Rutherford) are murdered. Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) meets with Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) to discuss the murders prompting her to travel to Hollywood, where she finds Dewey Riley (David Arquette) working as an advisor on the set of \\"Stab 3″, the third film in the film within a film series based on the Ghostface murders.<br /><br />After Ghostface kills \\"Stab 3″ actress Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy) he begins taunting Sidney by phone, having discovered her phone number, forcing her out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood. As the remaining \\"Stab 3″ cast gather at the home of Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), Ghostface kills her bodyguard Steven Stone (Patrick Warburton) and uses a gas-leak to cause an explosion, killing fellow actor Tom Prinze (Matt Keeslar).<br /><br />Dewey, Gale, Jennifer and the remaining \\"Stab 3″ actors Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) and Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond) attend a birthday party for the director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) where Ghostface strikes. Roman, Angelina, Tyson and Jennifer are killed and Ghostface orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey's lives.<br /><br />\\"Scream 3″ is the kind of movie that has a lot of great ideas mixed in with a few mediocre ideas. The film spends far too much time with Sidney away from the group, alone in the cabin. We want to see Sidney take on evil and put on a good fight. Something that doesn't happen here until the final act. That being said, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers has never been better. Given a bitter rival to play against, played by a deliciously witty Parker Posey, she shines in every single scene that she is given. Overall, I think \\"Scream 3″ is a fun film. It may be the worst installment of the franchise but it is still a hell of a lot better than 90% of the horror that is released today..

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Stick with it for a little while and you'll begin to feel comfortable using it.  There are tons of features!
B00493E1GI|2.0|So, I read the book (HATED IT) and couldn't get over how self-centered and awful the main character was.  Obviously, I was missing some big profound message or inspiration that has affected so many fans out there.  I just couldn't get past the fact that this woman was someone I did not like, that I would never be friends with, that I have absolutely no respect for!  That she was in Italy discovering a healthy relationship with food was preposterous!  Her story was vacuous and self-indulgent, and not really a story at all.  As for the interpretation of the movie, I hoped to find something that I missed in the book.  It was beautifully filmed but again, the character came across as ridiculous to me.  I like Julia Roberts and she did a decent job (I've seen her do better but this wasn't much of a role to sink anyone's teeth into).  I love Jarvier Bardem (LOVE) and he was a highlight for me... it's nice to see him in a vulnerable, romantic role rather than the villains that he's known for.  I just don't get the popularity of this rubbish and I usually enjoy deep, introspective movies/books!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A writer with great grace who takes you  through the lives and minds of her characters in such smoothness that you don't even realize how much you grow to care for them. This noel is about real life...real love... real feelings and (as I have always told my kids) the fact that life isn't always fair. Loved, loved, loved this book.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|Very good acting, amazingly artistic, more time could have been dedicated to the etiology of Kevin's behaviors in early development
B000FCKC4C|3.0|One of my college friends recommended this book to me some years ago and, despite the fact that I really wanted to like it, it didn't really make much of an impression on me. It felt like a pseudo-religious attempt to appeal to New Agey readers, making claims like \\"the universe conspires to help those who pursue their Personal Legends.\\" Okay, fine, but that only makes sense for people who live in developed countries. What kind of Personal Legend is it for an orphan in a third-world country just to get by and survive? The moral of the story felt overly narrow and didn't really move me. The writing style was accessible and the attention to detail was excellent, but I didn't really care for the philosophy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's a great movie with a hilarious cast and telltale signs of writers who actually care about what their characters are saying and doing. I recommend it to anyone. P.S. Love good singing voices, even if I'm not good at it myself.
1449410243|5.0|I know some have complained that a lot of these are available online, but not everyone is an internet addict like I am, so I bought several of these as gifts for my cat-loving (but internet novice) friends, and they couldn't be happier.  I know some people think it's crazy, but there's also something to having a real, tangible book in your hands.  With great illustration and high quality paper, this book is great.  Buy it.

The two main characters are extremely well done<br />(although with a touch of a My Fair Lady/poor girl/educated man overtone to them)<br />and the English town is a good backdrop for the plot. Many minor characters are<br />blended in without disrupting the tension.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought it was a good book and would recommend it for others.  Overall it was a pretty quick read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If you are a romantic at heart then you will love this book! I was rooting for this couple from the beginning. The reality of relationships mixed with starting a family conventionally, opens a point a view that women are considering today and yet still wanting the outcome of two parents. Very good!
B001VIMCW4|3.0|This movie was all about action, action, action. I wish there James Bond would have had an epiphany right about now where he realizes the major flaws of his heart. But it was good.

Can't wait to see how the movie turned out.

B0085KGHI6|5.0|[[ASIN:B0085KGHI6 Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones Live At The Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981 DVD/CD]]<br /><br />Ignore any negative reviews- this is an absolute delight for blues fans!  Beautifully remastered, sharp video and crisp sound.  Imagine those being lucky enough to have been there on that Sunday night in November, 1981, when the Rolling Stones showed up at Buddy Guy's blues club on the south side of Chicago.  Tiny club, tiny stage crowded with legends Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ron Wood, and others.<br /><br />For those of us who weren't lucky enough to be there on that magic evening, this is the next best thing- this video is so good you almost feel like you are there.<br /><br />If you appreciate unscripted, raw live performances, you will be really pleased.  I'm wondering what took them so long to officially release this- what a treat!

B009GX6600|5.0|If you have watched this show for a while you will either prefer something else or you will be hooked. The individual actor's/actress'es  are great at bringing their characters to life, and just when you think you know all about a character something new comes to light in a new episode that makes you re-evaluate the character or how they would respond to a situation. This show has remained fresh even after 9 seasons, not many shows even last that long. If you like more action oriented shows you will find some of that here, but it's the characters and how they interact that keep the show strong. Outside of losing one of the shows character's that someone might get attached to I can't see this show falling off anytime soon. I hope this show continues for as long as those involved can enjoy working on it, in whatever capacity.

The frames used in this movie remind me of a bad picture-in-picture rather than deliberate visual effects, and are way overdone, and the story lacked a compelling plot line.  Guess it was worth the rental price.

B004ZJZQJC|4.0|This is just a good movie. Watch it and just enjoy a good old movie that is not filled with blood gore or sex.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter. I didn't really know how many of his wonderful songs were on this cd. She loves it and so do I.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This novel had the right mix of historical fiction, mystery, and romance. The ending had a bit of a twist, but it was satisfying and exactly what I wanted for the characters.
B002V092B0|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who had had, or cares for someone who has had a stroke. A great insight in to the working of the brain.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great story with wonderful twists and turns. True surprises are difficult to come by these days but this had me guessing until the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half! It was fabulous! A real love story. Their relationship was a massive emotional roller coaster but so is almost all young (and most times, adult) relationshihps are. Some of the decisions on both Travis and Abby's parts were rushed that it sometimes made me go \\"huh?\\". But it fell together in the end. I am looking foward to the next book to see Travis' POV! I can't wait to see what his thoughts and feelings are about!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I actually tried reading this twice and never got past the beginning set up of the main character and financial scandal etc. But someone told me if I could get through that and keep going I would t be sorry. I am SO GLAD I gave it another try. What a great book. Suspenseful, Well written, definitely did not see a few things coming.  I did t wanna put the book<br />down. I'm almost done with he second book now and it's beter and better.
0425264386|4.0|Lee Childs delivers again.  I've read about 5 Reacher books so far and they are all terrific.  There's a scene in this book where Reacher, a large 6'5\\" ex-military cop is crawling in a cramped mountain passageway.  His flashlight goes off, the space is getting smaller and smaller as he crawls forward inch by inch, so he can't turn around and go back, and as he reaches out into the darkness, he touches a wall.  He's stuck.  I got so engrossed in this scene, I started hyperventilating, it was so intense!  Once you start reading Reacher novels, you'll be hooked just like me.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Ed Asner as Carl the Curmudgeon-y widower is very impressive. Jordan Nagai as Russell is actually not too cloying. Bob Peterson steals the show as Dug (and Alpha). The history of Carl and his wife is a pretty painful pill to swallow, as is the amount of sentimentality constantly represented by the souvenirs left in the house, but it's thankfully balanced by the lighthearted comedy that the dogs provide.<br /><br />While I don't think the movie was great, the reminders of Carl's wife Ellie frequently somber the mood and often Russel tip-toes into &#34;too dumb to live&#34; territory, the lush scenery and Ed Asner being Bad-ass Senior really raise a run-of-the-mill adventure into something majestic. Surprisingly, there was no extra about what happened to Muntz considering he was last seen on the house.<br /><br />As for the extras, Dug's adventure is more slapstick hilarity involving the dogs while Partly Cloudy was a disturing tale of a psychotic cloud.
B007NCTWX4|5.0|She is an amazing talent..a true musician who can not only sing but write with passion.  I like the ease of purchase through Amazon, and security using my account. I also ordered the soundtrack with Christina Perri's single &#34;A Thousand Years&#34; which drew me to her music in the first place.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|The description says this app can be used &quot;any time, any place, any screen&quot;  &quot;wherever you happen to be.&quot; Turns out you need a tv that's hooked up to the internet. That's a little misleading, if you ask me.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I've tried the free DLNA media streaming applications for android, and have been generally disappointed in them. This one (got as FAoD) is definitely one of the better ones. It was easier to configure and get running than most, and has more features. The people screaming, \\"requires Facebook login\\" are morons. It does indeed have Facebook integration, however, all you have to do is push the skip button.
0920668372|5.0|I received this book years ago when my son was small.  He's 23 now. I read it to him so much he had it memorized & could recite it verbatim.  It made me cry then & still does now.  There is nothing like the love of a mother for her child/children.  I give this book as a gift to everyone I know who is having a boy.  Love it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the way people use to write and use to act.  It is not without some nudity, profanity but it doesn't rely on it to replace the writing or acting.  This is not to be missed because this level of true entertainment is hardly ever achieved and it captures you from your living room and delivers you back at the end!!!!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I been a muse fun for the last 13 years<br />And they always deliver<br />This may be the weakest of theirs albums<br />But still some good stuff in here<br />If u r new to them<br />U may want to skip this one<br />And try some of their early stuff
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Tried to watch this when it first came out, but couldn't get past the Peg Bundy.  After hearing all my friends rave about it, I decided to try it again.  Now, I'm hooked...got a lot of catching up to do though to get current.  Love the characters!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Casual Vacancy is the story of the people Harry Potter was trying to escape when he went to Mugwort. You can easily turn this into a Harry Potter Prequel, for example, just by adding some budding wizardry and magic to the mix. A sort of what happened before the kids came to Mugwort. In fact, the story itself could be a Harry Potter book by just changing all the characters to magical fantasy ones. All the themes are still there, except no magic. So, when people say it's a big change I don't think so. Many of the catalysts in the plot lines are moved along by children. Life and death, good and evil, venal and carnal, petty and profound -- St. Michael stepping on evil, parental/adult power and chidren's reactions. And on and on. Instead of the fantasy characters and charicatures of the Harry Potter books, she decided go with \\"reality\\". Instead of being able to escape into fantasy (and then from the pan to the fire anyway) kids and characters were stuck with reality and all the fantasies they could create right there.<br />  Regarding the book itself, it has intimations of greatness for the author in the future. She's proven she can plot--so can soap opera or series writers, she's clever with the names, she's not afraid to showcase casual and consistent meanness of spirit, with little snippets of spirits that try to be compassionate, and she goes for some lights at the end of big long dreary tunnels. It was hard to care about all the myriad characters but easy to dislike them--a flaw in her writing. It was hard to keep track of them all because they were all just part of the 'soup' of small town England (or provincial minds anywhere rural or urban) None really stood out. They all had their roles to play and sometimes it seemed like caricature. -- and the unbelievable plot line at the end just to get the boy to the river and to finish the book. In the end, however, I didn't particularly LIKE the book, but those I usually don't finish, this book I finished because I willlook forward to reading the next book of JK Rowling. We are all in the presence of a very gifted and creative artist. This is a good transition work from Harry Potter to her next endeavors.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.  v Watch it. Watch it.<br />That's what I suggest
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It is difficult to write an impartial review of this book, when you are a dog owner.The book grabbed my attention, right from the cover, with a picture of dog and intriguing title. The story from a perspective of a dog has everything. The reader cannot help, but to laugh and cry and at same time you cannot put the book down as the reader is curious of the outcome. The only complaint I have is, that now I am really curious what my dog thinks of me and what it wants to become, when it departs into happy hunting grounds.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This show is great.  Many unexpected things happen that keep you wanting more.  We can't get enough of the show.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. I thought Abby was strong and Travis was hot. Jamie McGuire has a way of making the reader care for all the characters. I cant wait to read the sequel. Good job Jamie! Keep writing awesome books and Ill keep reading them.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is more than an SEAL, he is an American hero in my eyes. He recounts horrific events with grace and respect to those he served with. I am proud to be protected EVERYDAY by the men and women who so selflessly give up their lives for us. God Bless America and God Bless our troops...formerly, presently and those who have yet to serve.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are very good and it works really well.  It is fun to play and helps to teach responsibility.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|So thankful this book was recommended to me by a friend.  I couldn't put it down.  I also highly recommend it.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I read the second book first, but was not lost at all. The author does a great job in both books. I love the old ladies and of course the neighbor cop.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|awesome movie. Really good artwork in this movie. The story line mimics alot of other movies, but itw well worth it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Wonderfully written and thought provoking . Great for all ages, reading his 2nd book now, very talented. A page turner. Could not put it down.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. its a great way to pass time away. i really like how interactive it is. you must be patient in beginning but gets better
B00003CX5P|4.0|I bought this as a replacement for my Star Wars DVD Set which was lost in a house fire. Although I have not yet watched this DVD, it looks to be in excellant condition. It was shipped in short order and I will not hesitate to order from Amazon.com in the future.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Hooked on this series!  The absolute best ever.  If you haven't seen it, this is an excellent investment in entertainment.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|This is a really great value. I got it for a friend for Christmas and didn't realize just how nice it was going to be. There are a few little extras such as a little motion flip book of him doing the Subterranean Homesick Blues music video. Very cool.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|movie is all over the place, looks great but is lame.  don't pay for it, wait for it to be free on amazon prime
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if you like horses this is your type of game you get to take care of horses and ride rlthem and even play in compotions
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever.... A true classic based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee.  It's good to see a movie about family and life's lessons without seeing one single thing getting blown up....
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is so imaginative and I have always loved littlest pet shops and have a total of 111.  I would recomend this game to any girl that loves pets!!!  the only thing that I would change is that there are so many things that need those gem things and it costs real money and since I am a kid... that's hard to get.  over all great game. :);)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not quit as exciting as the first 2, but good wrap up of the first 2 books! I loved the book!
1419702238|5.0|I purchased several Wimpy Kid books for my 2nd grade grandson who is becoming an excellent reader.  He loves reading these and I sometimes will find him sitting alone reading out loud.  Highly recommend for any young readers.
1585104205|5.0|Lingua Latina is a fantastic series that helps te reader to learn Latin by a more natural method. I am studying wheelocks Latin and it helps to have lingua Latina on the side to anchor what I've read. Although I'm using lingua Latina as a supplement it would definitely stand alone as a latin course. I personally Think that having some knowledge of what you are studying is a help however, ie to know the names of the Latin cases. Consider pairing Lingua Latina with Wheelocks, or even just look up \\"Latin by the DowlIng method\\" to have a little bit more concrete understanding.<br /><br />As far as the \\"Illustrata\\" version of lingua Latina, it is certainly a nicer printing and binding and the images are full color. In the regular version of Lingua Latina Familia Romana  all the same illustrations are printed but they are black and white line drawings (compared to the same drawings  colored in in \\"Illustrata\\")<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />God bless

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Is the type of book you star reading and cant stop .The chapter are not too long so the story has a good dymanic change  with more intrigid .Of course I like the book and I recommended to read to anyone who likes Mr.Grisham.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|It was predictable in the plot, but the scares were not your average scares from these people. It seems they attempted going a different route in making it more subtle. What a mistake, the ending was like it was from a different movie if you compare it to the beginning. I enjoyed the night vision scenes the most.
B009H442DG|3.0|Songs are okay.  I was looking for more but it was an okay addition to my home Christmas music collection.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was better than a lot of reviews I read. Too many people are in a hurry to keep things moving faster and faster. This book was just right. I will wait impatiently for the next one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Can' t stop playing!  Its nice to be able to . go back and play different levels over and over again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very cool. I play it all day and all the time. I give it 5 stars. I love the zoomed in graphics. Awesome.

B008NR8YTQ|5.0|This is the best cd I have heard since gold & platinum by lynrard skynard I would definetly order more Gary moore cds off of here without a doubt thank you very much for the order I am sure the cd blues for jimi will be just as good
0316228532|5.0|I am one of the few persons who has not read HP. Therefore, I was not able to compare it with anything from her.  All I could say is that I love it. The characters are perfectly described, you can truly recognise the characters in our society... And it truly made me think a lot, how we are all related and connected. Any action from us  will always have an impact on our society, no matter how small this action might be. I absolutely recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game.  The only problem is, that being left-handed, reaching across the screen to tap a card is hard on my shoulder. Otherwise, it is a fun game.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|I purchased this CD in honor of Donna Summers passing. Never really considered myself a die hard fan but I do have a great appreciation for several of her classics. God Bless Donna Summers and her family and know such a legacy cannot be repeated.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|We were searching for a relatively recent kids film to watch with our 10 year-old and she recommended Brave from the TV commercials she had seen last year. Well, what a disappointment!  The message re mother-daughter relatins got completely obscured by the ludicrous fighting scenes (apparently they were supposed to be funny?).  The worst was the scene where the bear/mother was tied and trapped in preparation for slaughter.  A children's film?  Did anyone really enjoy this film?
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Completely enjoy listening to Michael Jackson anytime. I wish there were a few more of my favorites on this collection but that just means I'll have to purchase a few more and/or the 25 year History version...Oh well I suffer through it LOL!!!!
B000ID1J40|5.0|This is a great feel good spy movie with some great underlying themes. Sidney Pointier, Dan Ackroyd and many others find a thrill in breaking into banks for money. What they discover is that government want a magic box which can break any code for only one reason, to spy on other agencies in the government. We see the real reason for political undercurrent in American Culture, and infers a greater need for public involvement.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading The Wheel of Time 20 years ago. I bought THE EYE OF THE WORLD for my father, but started reading it when he didn't. After a couple false starts, I was hooked. And so, 20 years later, with enough books to fill an entire bookshelf and enough characters to fill a high-rise condo, the series has come to an end.<br /><br />I was skeptical that the series could survive Jordan's death. But I was proven wrong. Jordan's wife and editor, Harriet McDougal, made a wise choice in picking the relatively unknown (at the time) Brandon Sanderson. He faced tremendous risks. The world seemed primed to reject his writing. But, despite those odds, he succeeded. Already a fan of the series, Sanderson injected a fresh energy and style to the series that kept me hooked.<br /><br />Similarly, I was skeptical that so many plot threads could be successfully tied up. I think we all remember how Lost left so many threads hanging, and what plot lines they did resolve, they did so in a terrible way. Let me just say that A MEMORY OF LIGHT does not repeat those mistakes.<br /><br />Everything has been building up to this moment: the Final Battle. Tarmon Gai'don. Rand must unite the world under the banner of the Light to face the forces of Darkness. Fittingly, a battle this big does not have one front line. It's a series of battles. Heroes will rise to the occasion, and yes, some will fall. Whole nations will be destroyed so that the world might survive. The battle lines shift as quickly as the point of view characters, but the story doesn't ever feel jumbled or confusing.<br /><br />The plot moved along quickly, so much so that I had to force myself to slow down. I don't think I was quite ready for this saga to come to an end. But I couldn't do it. I tore through this book. I enjoyed realizing just how dramatically those youths from Two Rivers had grown and changed into the leaders and heroes of the Final Battle. They each have their own desires, goals, means, and motivations. And trust me, no one is safe. Additionally, I was impressed with the number of surprises and reversals in this story. Sanderson and Jordan keep readers guessing, as the outcome of the Final Battle is far from a forgone conclusion, despite all those prophecies.<br /><br />On the whole, I enjoyed this conclusion. Although it was bittersweet to place the final book on the shelf, I did so with a smile. But it wasn't perfect. There were a couple moments that were too cute or too coincidental for my tastes. And I suspect the epilogue will prove quite controversial among the fans. It threatened to fall into the \\"too cute\\" category, but when you consider that it was one of the last things Jordan wrote, you see it through his eyes: a man confronting death and looking back on his life and works. Seen that way, I think it works. But it will certainly give fans something to talk about.trust me, no one is safe.

1419705849|5.0|A Christmas gift for my grandson.  He doesn't get too excited anymore about gifts, but he started reading this book when he open it and continued to read it the rest of the evening.  So I think he really like this gift.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|It bored my butt off for the 1st hour ... turned it off.  Don't waste your money on this trite film
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great way to conclude the series and to start off the Hero's of Olympus series. I loved reading this book and if you haven't read it yet,  you definitely should.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|This game was ok, it was what I expected and it was a clean interface.  I did not find the game very engaging though.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|game is really a adventure in playing. kept me going till the end and was leaving you wanting more. can't wait for the sequel!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|The quality on these discs is not top quality.  Every so often while viewing them the discs will freeze and eventually go on. It's very distracting.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|I thought this was a very good animated feature going into the Red Hood story from the comics and from what I've been told that it does follow it pretty good. Voice acting and animation are great and the story is top notch. If your a batman fan then I think you should pick this one up. Plus it's pretty cheap now to get.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is by far one of my most favorite games. Can play it on my kindle fire or facebook page. Lots of fun. Just wish you earned more bingo credits the more levels you clear vs having to pay for them.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I thought this was a really good found footage type horror/ghost movie. It is worth picking up and watching probably around Halloween time and with maybe a few beers in hand :) All in all a very solid ghost movie which is actually very entertaining to watch so either rent it or buy it but you need to watch it. The second is also coming out very soon so if you liked this one then go check out the second one when it does release.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Enjoyed this one very much!  Bosch has his work cut out for him. Lots of twists and turns and just when I thought I had the answer, it turned yet again.<br /><br />I am a real fan of Harry Bosch!  Great Read.
0316123587|4.0|Bought this awhile ago and was very happy with it, but looking through it again I realized that there were elements of a real yearbook that it was missing, and they could have had more characters (and more of certain other characters).<br /><br />Alll-in-all very nice but could have been better to a degree.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|not very good grammar, but a good read. Lots of activity, twists and turns. Too much repetitiveness into Jack's background.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Though it was not as good as the first two, especially &#34;The Dark Knight,&#34; it was still an excellent movie. Think of it as Return of the Jedi in the first Star Wars Trilogy or The Godfather Part III of the Godfather Trilogy (both I recommend greatly); both films were very good, but because of the bar set by the first two films of the trilogy, it made it tough for the concluding film to exceed that set standard. That does not take away anything from the film or say anything bad about; it is that this film did not exceed the first two films. This film is for Batman fans or superhero movie fans. It is an excellent film. Personally, I wish this one was not the end of the Christopher Nolan Batman films!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I haven't finished the book quite yet but so far I am glad I ordered it. It is an amazing acount of the author's near death experience.
B002ZG976U|5.0|So much talent packed into one film! Excellent voice, dance and wit. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gotta love the books that make you think and continue to surprise you. And this is one that does that trick.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I bought this movie for myself not knowing my mom had gotten it for me for Christmas. I gave it to one of my best friends instead because we both love this movie! Fast shipping, and the DVD and case were in perfect condition.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Downloaded and installed on my kindle fire with no problems. Play is smooth and easy to understand. Had doubt. as there were too many five star ratings. They are well deserved and I can only echo what others have said. A great way to relax and a definate keeper.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|As all G5 games the graphics are great. This one is the winner for being the slowest to download on my kindle fire. In fact it took so long I fell asleep and when I woke two hours later it had loaded. So I really do not know how long it took. Some control problems and it crashed twice so far. Almost uninstalled it but thought I would give it another try. So far so good.<br />Played as far as I could and then surprise! Wanted cash to unlock the rest of the game.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|micheal buble is magic i love this cd and play it all the time at home,in the car. and at work
B0050VI5SI|5.0|One of the best alternative bands to date! Foster The People brought it with this cd! First drawn in by Pumped Up Kicks, I quickly discovered all the other songs are just as brilliant in their own unique way! The diversity of all 10 songs is fantastic, and yet the bands \\"sound\\" is retained within each. This is one of the few cds I've ever heard/owned that every song is excellent and I've yet to tire of (of course any cd would become torment if played 24/7). I'm anxious to hear their next cd! If you're reading this and don't own this album, do yourself a favor and get it. Life's too short to miss out on this work of art! An album that's of it's time and leads the way with Torches!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is the second novel I read of Gillian Flynn and I must say she never disappoints her readers. The twists and turns she used in this novel had me turning one page after another and sneaking in quick reads whenever possible.

B003DWC6IQ|5.0|No need to recommend any more Jeffery Archer. Anyone who  has read any of his books should read all of them, and this one is  one of his best.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|The book is overly long and very predictable. The writing is stilted and formulaic. Your time can be invested better wit another book.
B0012DZ356|4.0|I don't remember very much about this book.  Sometimes I get tired of reading &#34;coming of age&#34; stories.  I have read several stories that are similar to this.  This was also a book selection and I might have preferred another book for discussion.
0525952926|3.0|I have been a Follett fan for years, and have been waiting for Winter of the World to hit the book shelves. And it pains me to say it, but this book was not worth the wait. Two things stand out in this book that were a continuing annoyance to me as I \\"worked\\" my way through it. First, while all of Follett's recent books have had many characters and go back and forth between them as the story progresses, this one is much more difficult than any of the previous ones.  I find myself constantly going back to earlier parts of the book to refresh my memory of who the characters are when the story line switches between the various characters. Second, and much more annoying is that Follett is making the mistake of clearly showing a personal political preference as the story progresses, i.e., Democrats and liberals are good, and Republicans and conservatives are bad. He attempts to somehow make this distinction subtle and a normal part of the story line, but he failed in that regard. His throwing partisan politics into his story is not only a distraction, but results in simply poor writing. He did not do himself justice by injecting partisan politics into his dialogue, and I think it is offensive and unprofessional. I will finish this book, but will never buy another book by this author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A complex, entertaining masterpiece. The mysterious intrigue mixed with humerous moments make viewing delightful. Six more words add nothing, period.
B00009RDG8|4.0|When this movie came out in 2002, I found it to be very fascinating because this was not the type of flick where the bad guy dies by a bullet to the head, this time around he was being sliced to death!  Maybe I am a twisted individual for liking this aspect of the movie but I think there's something cool about it, especially for the reason that he hunts those who do the hunting-call in equalization.  The movie also highlights the issues that plague soldiers when they come home from war.  Most of them are scarred for life with visuals of death and destruction and the mindset of killed or be killed is hard to shake...hard to turn off if you will and this movie exploits that.  I loved this movie when it came out over a decade ago and I can still appreciate it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I started up all night on a school night to read this and didn't even realize it. It was fantastically written.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Rented this movie because I thought it would be one that I would only watch once.  Then ended up watching it twice.  It was good.  It was funny and entertaining.  The music was great and although the way they fit some of the songs in was a little corny, it still worked and made for a good story.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|or do they call it that any more?  Glad to see there's still a following for vinyl. And of course, it is the Foo Fighters!
B007YQAYDG|4.0|I saw Michael Kiwanuka perform on Jimmy Fallon, where he played Tell Me A Tale; definitely my favorite track. After listening to the snippets here, I decided everything sounded good enough to want to buy the whole album. Very different style of music than I usually listen to, but it's extremely pleasant. I wish more of the tracks were as upbeat as Tell Me a Tale; some of them are a little slow for my taste, but at the same time, the whole album presents a very nice mix.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Slash, along with Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators, have made an excellent album! Slash's guitar playing is exceptional and so are Myles' vocals. My favorite track is &#34;Anastasia&#34;....check out the guitar work...it is amazing!
B00001IVQT|5.0|No one can play like Ashkenazy,  even Rachmaninov cannot play as well, except maybe Julian Katchen, but loved this CD
1423151054|5.0|Absolutely fantastic collection of work by the true masters. A great addition to the archive series of books.<br />Beautifully presented and worth every cent!
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Loved this book, it's very well written and extremely well researched so while the characters and the story are fiction it gives you a good insight into the second world war.
1423165691|4.0|The drawings aren't attributed to their artists (as they wouldn't be in a sketchbook anyway), but aside from this, it's an inspiring book of beautiful work. Not quite as nice a book as the archive series of animation, layout and design, but it's full of really great stuff.
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie was a bit of a waste of time. I did not find the plot worth it. It was very predictable
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An engaging love story. I couldn't put it down! Highly recommend, can't wait to see the movie! Read it now!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|This movie is entertaining for kids and adults.  It is very funny and creative, bla bla bla.<br />got to get it, you will not be sorry
B000VSYDRM|5.0|The title alone, drew me in. But the store kept me glued.<br />I wasn't sure what to make of this at first, it is a bit slow paced for me. But I like how they took their time developing the guys character. It was absolutely VITAL to the story. So vital, that he turned out to be the hero rather than the villain. The acting was great in this movie. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I liked how everything that they shot made sense and it mattered. It had to be in the movie.<br />I like movies that require a back story, I appreciate that. I would love to watch more imaginative movies like this in the future. Well done.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once I started reading the book it was hard to put it down. I can see why it has remained on the best seller list for so long. I can't say that I  ended up liking the main characters all that much but it had an interesting plot and was well written and I enjoyed it very much
B0019I6WDG|5.0|I ejoyed the movie, it was real convient for me to watch it from my computer because the movie was part of a home work assignment.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was very touching.  I felt like I was able to connect with all of the characters in this book and I would of course recommend it to all women seeking a thriller, mystery, romance type of novel.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I love Celine Dion and love the CD.......Good music/.  You also have good prices and good service which I appreciate.
0345803485|1.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy was given to me & I am very glad I did not buy the books. I actually got to the 10th chapter before I gave up. I will not be finishing this book nor reading the other two, it was awful. The story was a joke & I seriously do not get the hype about this book. Anastasia reminds me of a girl with low self-worth that will do anything this guy wants her to just because she hates herself. They could have made it a better book by making her a confident woman who knows what she wants out of life & actually likes herself, then she can make the decision to be with him if she so chooses.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It took me a little bit to get into it, but once I did, it was hard to stop. The notion of being lost in time, then finding out what`s behind the curtain was really interesting. Pretty good read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my favorite computer card games, now on the kindle fire. The touch screen card play beats the mouse hands down.  A welcomed time spender.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Not too long, good insights into how Cuban got to where he is today.  Lots of short stories about his various jobs and business relationships he made.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not at all what I thought it would be,this trilogy.........<br />Sex, sex,sex........everybody said.<br />I couldn't put it down!  Such a love story.<br />Excellent, e.l. James........truly excellent writing........
B000H8SFMK|5.0|This was another great album from the Pogues. If you like Irish music this is a must. The shopping experience was easy and fast shipping.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like that I can get ebooks that are old, discontinued or brand new that I can't get from other ebook providers.  But after I brought a book I had to shut down the tablet before I could get the ebook after I downloaded it.
B009MO5960|5.0|This movie is another great addition to the current Resident Evil lineup. Alice is back in her most action packed movie yet. The special features are a nice bonus.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie is definately worth watching. It's a good buildup to the Avengers movie. Great performances by all of the actors.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Good story. Easy read. Must like dog stories. Author draws you into the story. Would recommend to others. Very much enjoyed this book.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The movie is really good except for Kristen Stewart who couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. The cinematography is top notch. Hemsworth and Theron are superb, but again, Stewarts acting is actually comical.
B00A8LRIEW|1.0|What happened to New Order ? They used to be a good band. This one is probably one the worsts albuns i ever heard. I cant believe the same band recorded the songs in SUBSTANCE and TECHNIQUE albuns. Maybe they want just do a tour and play their back catalogue and just this will be fine for everyone. Just the first song is really worth the rest of the album you can put on the garbage.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|best app for time telling that I could find.  the adds on it are not very obtrusive either. overall, a pretty good download.
B002LII6KA|5.0|Can't beat the entire collection of this great franchise. The case looks awesome and keeps the discs secure without the fear of wearing out!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Just what we ordered and a lot of fun. The family was excited and looks forward to using it year after year.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is a classic and it was a shame my collection was lacking. Remedied that with this great movie.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Item came quickly and was packed great. It is just what we had expected and works fine. We have had no problems.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had minecraft for Pc and it is amazing so when I found out it was on kindle I bought it no questions asked!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great book couldn't put the book down.  the story just keeps getting better and better. Love this series of books.
B002CVQ7P2|5.0|CD came in perfect condition. This is my first Hatfield & The North CD.<br />I'm planning on buying more such as The Rotters' Club.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use! I love the app. Easy to repin.  Easy to go back to the original source. Would recommend to everyone
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I really enjoy the show, will be sad when it ends. I reaaly enjoy the extra commentarys with the producers.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|The movie was very eye opening from a biblical view although there is alot of volience. He had a mission to carry out and he completed the task and gave it all he had. I believe it is eye opening because we can take the things we currently have access to for granted especially the daily use of water, food and the necessities of life.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was amazing! I made the mistake of getting them around the holidays I think because it took awhile to get here. But other than that I'm completely happy. These books are great for older readers I recommend you be 17+. I loved them so much I wish they would make more!
1845767055|5.0|If you love Fantasy/Sci-Fi art this is a must own! Bonner is an unbelievable artist ! Buy this ! You won't regret it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a excellent little app. I can tell at a glance what has been used and for what. I can also see how much power is left and what it can be used for.
0739366408|4.0|What a great way to tell a story!! I defiantly recommend this book.... I received it in audio format and listen to it in the car on the way to work..... Many times I drove around the block so I could keep listening. Great story!!!!! When is the next one????
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book is just another \\"White Light Tale\\" written this time by a pompous doctor who seems to think because he is by nature & training a superior human being, he  could not have dreamed his way through a coma.  He offers nothing in the way of facts.  He is so impressed by his \\"unique\\" experience, he spends most of the time writing about events that led up to his coma, without an iota of \\"proof\\" that his visions are true.  The man is a total bore & his book an ego trip. I am infuriated that I fell for the hype & wasted my money. Save your money ... or give it to your church.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|So in the battle between Apple and Amazon I went in early with Amazon.I joined their App store day one and have gotten a bunch of free great apps.I then went for Mp3 Player and was a little mad when you had to start paying for what was unlimited space. I now have great cross use between 2 kindle fires, android phone and computer.Nice to upload right to cloud from my phone and original kindle fire is even more useful.
0446554995|3.0|i've read every single preston\child book, and i am a loyal fan, so it pains me to say this, but this book really wasn't all that great. i give it 3 stars because it will definitely keep your interest, but overall, it's a bit of a letdown, compared to the other novels in the series.<br /><br />my main issues are these: *potential spoiler*<br /><br />(1) the situations, behaviour, escapes, etc with pendergast are WAY over the top. beyond bizarre. my intelligence was insulted. i understand we have to suspend our disbelief, but this novel was too much. at one point i was waiting for pendergast to hold aloft a magic sword and say \\"by the power of grayskull\\".<br /><br />(2) nazis? really? how trite. *yawn*<br /><br />(3) the constance green and corrie swanson storylines had nothing to do with anything, and it seems like they were just added as filler, and to take our minds away from the fact the main story wasn't quite up to snuff.<br /><br />(4) the \\"twist\\" was rather lazy as well. it's like the authors said \\"hmmm...we don't have much to talk about. i know! let's add new family members!\\". they did the same thing with diogenes several novels back. i guess when they run out of family members, they'll start adding pets, a la stephen king's \\"cujo\\"<br /><br />the book is definitely worth borrowing from the library (that's what i did). so in that regard, it's an ok read because i paid nothing for it.
1451695195|1.0|Not doubting the author's experience at all, but the bulk of the book was about the author and his illness and scientific explanation. No mention of Jesus, or hell, or salvation, or what to do with the experience in heaven. Also didn't appreciate the renaming of God, and the angels, and heaven, and earth etc. Cannot justify this with the Holy Bible. The good to be taken away is the author's acknowledgement that the constant and overidding thing about the heavenly realm is the Love of Om (his name for God).
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I absolutely loved the fact that the movie stepped right into the Judge Dredd universe without wasting time on setup of the character or any other nonsense. Gritty, hardcore, and no comic relief like in previous versions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh what American TV producers could only learn about great writing, character development, content that actually can touch its audience, and plain great story telling if they only paid attention.    Disclaimer: In my opinion a product that performs as expected will never receive more than four stars. I think that to deserve a five star rating, a product should surprise me with value, benefits and deliverables that exceed my expectations and reasons for choosing it in the first place. Otherwise, how can I give an adequate rate those truly exceptional products that every once in a while, we our great delight, happen upon......
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not bad for a free download but the characters ran hot and cold. One minute you are rooting for them the next they are such stereo types it's hard to go on. On balance it was a fun read, but I've read better.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Total copy of every other photo program the photo's used in the sales pitch are fake it's a lesser version of the ones with built in video recorder.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game.  Keeps the kids and adults entertained while on the road or waiting in the Doctor's office.  Can't beat the price.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love t it has always be here you should even raise the price I mean it's free at least 99 cent  cause this is needed to.wake you up and all the selections you v you get is wonderful<br />-Jojo
B008K9UZY4|1.0|Hard to review an application that I was never able to download.  So nice of Amazon to charge for something that doesn't install.
0143119680|4.0|loved this book!..it was campy and fun and am looking forward to the next installment...i highly reccomned this to all readers of this genre...
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I enjoyed reading about such an important person in my lifetime.  Sometimes those with bright minds are difficult!<br />I learned so much about Steve Jobs.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|I thought this movie was really frightening since it was based on a true story.  Entertaining with a decent storyline.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you should be proud of yourself for making such a good app! I think you did such a good job you should even put it on phones
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This little game is great fun. I'm in AZ for the winter & play it with my daughters back in WI. It's basically mobile pictionary. I like it so much I'm considering puchasing the full version.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|I recommend this movie to all my friends. I enjoyed it thoroughly in the theater and plan to enjoy it on those boring evenings when you can't find anything on tv.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|page turner and emotional, must read, loved the relationship and the fact that you find yourself gasping as you turn the pages
B0036EH40Q|5.0|I recommend this movie to all my friends. I enjoyed it thoroughly in the theater and plan to enjoy it on those boring evenings when you can't find anything on tv.
B007N85POS|4.0|Fun game, a good change from the space themes.  Gotta love the rescue of kidnapped birds and fish, but the evil monkeys are my favorite so far.<br />The first games of the first level are pretty simple, but if you have little ones that are ready to play, they may be able to manuever some wins.<br />Glad I purchased it!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a very cute movie.  If you are looking for something light and requires no concentration - this is the movie for you!  It is entertaining and the singing is good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great read! I loved the characters Hazel and Augustus. It was a quick read and I loved  reading from an adolescents perspective on having cancer. Although sad it was also uplifting. I Definitely recommend this book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bougth this book because of many five stars reviews and they were correct.<br />I began reading and couldn´t stop.<br />The story is fantastic, the descrition of the silo is amazing, I almost feel my legs sores because the steps, I love the caracteres, Jules, Solo, people from Mecanics and much more.<br />When I finished the book I bougth Shift 1 and 2 and wait very ansious the Shift 3.<br />I love books about the end of known world, but the Silo saga is one of the best.<br />I strongly recommend this book.<br />Maria Aparecida
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Sang to all the lyrics on this cd. Used it for workout since the music is very energetic. Fan of Rihanna
B005K0HDGE|4.0|While this is not a \\"typical\\" Stephen King book, it is certainly well worth reading. Personally, it got me thinking about how time travel is NOT as good of an idea as some people think it might be. When I say a \\"typical\\" Stephen King book, I'm thinking of his earlier works such The Shining and It. But if you loved The Green Mile, then you might just enjoy this book.
0679805273|5.0|Used as a thank you to those graduating foreign medical students who worked with us for a number of years. They were informed of the American tradition of presenting a graduate with this &#34;medical text&#34;. Well appreciated by the students.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is addicting.  It is fun and got challenging in the higher levels.  Interface worked well and was attractive too.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed decided to go on her very own vision quest/walkabout and proves to us that all you need is grit, determination and a little bit of luck to change your life. You won't for get this book any time soon.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I bought this item as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  When we finally had a chance to play the first movie in the series last weekend, we were disappointed to find that the Blu-ray was apparently defective.  Within a minute of starting, the video began to pixelate and stop on occasion.  The audio cut out.  Eventually the movie just froze.  I went to Amazon to initiate a return of the item but stopped short because Amazon suggested I upgraded the firmware in my Blu-ray player.  I spent the next eight hours doing just that (don't ask - it involved networking the device, which it hadn't been before).  Anyway, I did upgrade the player and tried again.  Same outcome.  So I asked Amazon for a replacement and shipped the defective set back.<br /><br />The replacement arrived very quickly (kudos to Amazon replacement policies and convenience of return shipment).  I just tried it and, lo and behold, the first movie worked - problem solved!  Well, not really.  I had noticed that the quality of the video wasn't really \\"Blu-ray\\" - more like SD  (I had noticed it in the first set too, but since it stopped playing entirely then, I attributed it to the disk being bad).  Could it be that the manufacturer of these disks simply converted SD-quality source movies to Blu-ray format?  Or was it that the initial Harry Potter wasn't available in Blu-ray resolution?  To test that theory, I decided to view the last movie in the series.  Since that had just come out in 2012, I figure it must surely be in full Blu-ray quality.  I put the disk in and got the error message \\"This disk cannot be played\\"!  Oh no :-(<br /><br />I know my Samsung Blu-ray player (purchased from Amazon) is not defective as it plays other Blu-ray movies, such as Blade Runner (also purchased from Amazon), just fine - I just checked to make sure.  Therefore, it must be this disk set.  Amazon should really have a word with the manufacturer about their quality control.  I don't seem to be the only one having difficulties with this set.  I gave up on this set.  Returning it today for a refund.<br /><br />Update: I later also had trouble with all the Blu-ray discs I tried from Red Box.  This causes me to rethink that it was the discs, after all.  It looks like my Samsung BD-P1600 is just very picky about what Blu-ray discs it plays (maybe only the old style before BD-Live?)  Updated the star rating.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Great story and a great documentary. If Aryton Senna was still around he would've dominated not just F1 but I think even more motorsport series
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He is amazing! Like the singers of days gone by. No hype, no gimmicks, just pure talent. A great addition to your Christmas collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One of the more fun free apps out there. I just wish the stuff in game wasn't so expensive! But no matter since I can see myself becoming addicted!
034580404X|5.0|Great read and you can't put it down. Still on the first book, but looking forward to the next two.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|worth the buy, episodes go off line so quickly on free watch sites. this way i have them to travel and keep forever
B008I34YYY|5.0|A film that seemed to have been never released in the States.....<br /><br />It's a funny, campy great B film, I mean &#34;really great&#34; film.....<br /><br />It's one of those films that you either Love it or Hate it, there is no in-between....<br /><br />Except for it's critics who look too deeply into a film that is exactly what it proposes to be.....<br /><br />A MUST GET.......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game...I love being able to care for the horse:) I would definitely recommend it. plus its free, so at least give it a try.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|Nothing more to be said than this is a great movie that is both frightening and funny....<br /><br />A great cast who deliver some underrated performances....
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daughter loves Bridgit's CD. She listens to it all the time. Bridget is SO talented and she has such an amazing voice.

B005ETA5K2|1.0|the electronic devise would not load on my computer. i have been using a similar device from same manuf. for over a year w/o problem.  a flyer in the box says that if you are having a problem to call customer service( for alfa, the manufacturer) for help.  i called twice, once left on hold for 29 min.  second call the customer care tech.  basically said if i was to stupid to follow the diagrams there was nothing he could do for me.  this person could not even speak to the device, he didn't know anything about it.  i am sending it back.  if i were amazon i would think twice about using this manufacturer.  some customer svc.  i felt like iwas talking the the night costodian.  i tried to load this device for, not lesss than ,4 hrs and could not do it.  the screens that the instructions came with were not the screens which appeared on my computer.  it was like talking to a wall.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|My son love it. He's always playing with it, so much time in my opinion, but it's Ok because he's very happy.
0307744434|2.0|Guess this was not for me. Don't really like circus stories. It was recommended on Good Reads which is usually a good source of new books.
0765325950|5.0|What can I say about my favorite writer that hasn't already been said?  The series continues to entertain me.  Get lost in the stories and ENJOY the whole series!
1439152802|5.0|Loved all Kate Morton books and this is the best. Keeps you engaged til the surprise ending. Couldn't put it down.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Love this movie.  Great plot, with great actors.  Very high action.  You will enjoy very much if you watch on a hd tv with a good sound system.
0399246665|5.0|Eric Carle is one of my favorite children's author/illustrators.  These laminated books were a gift for my grandchild.  Kids love the simple, thoughtful, colorful stories.  The small size and sturdy construction are plus factors too.
B00005JNJV|5.0|If you are a fan of any of the batman movies, shows or comics, it is a must own.  I am a huge fan of the original (Keaton) batman movies and these new ones really give the original a run for its money.  Great acting too.
B00948EPOQ|5.0|Not your typical Woody Allen.<br />Lovely romantic comedy with lots of history thrown in.<br />Beautiful shots of Paris, and a wonderful cast!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I know I dont have to explain why I like this movie, so I wont go into detail.  If you have seen this movie then you know why you should buy it.  If you haven't seen it then get out from under the rock you are living under and buy this movie.
1863514260|3.0|Trish Burr has written a beautiful book.  I do have a problem with her teminology.  She doesn't differiate between shades, hues and tints.  At one point she calls the values of a color (hue) shades when it fact they are all tints. As I thought this was about color in embroidery I thought she would have been more accurate. Otherwise a beautiful book.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I think this is the best book in the series I can't wait to read the prequel James dashner did a good job
B004YXE438|5.0|This game is great. The only thing I don't like is the music, but there's an option to mute it. For anyone who enjoys puzzles, this is for you. There's a very simple level, a medium level, and an even harder one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My boyfriend snores terribly and white noise, fans, and soft music weren't cutting it. I run this app on my kindle every night and it really is like I'm sleeping in a beach house on a rainy night. Cheesy maybe but this app rocks!
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Cameron Diaz saved this film for me. Wish she had time to star in more films. Her character has a heart, and a lot of fun felt sarcasm. A TEN star rating for her believable portrayals, always.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves this game.  She can relate because she can draw stickman!  She wakes up every morning asking to play this game.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher has done well in both her singing and acting careers.  Ms. Aguilera is an American treasure. A well casted film.
1400049628|3.0|because you never know when the zombie apocalypse is going to strike, better to be prepared :) it's a fun read, I ended up skimming after the first 100 pages or so.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Not to be confused with that awful &quot;tongue frozen to the pole&quot; Christmas Story, this movie is an almost magical telling of the story of Santa. It tugs at your heart strings and will leave you and your family wanting to watch it again and again. Each year I pack it away with our ornaments and we watch it after decorating our Christmas tree. It's dubbed in English but please do not let that change your mind, they did a very good job with the dubbing.
B000GBFQT8|5.0|Starting reading it to me daughter (five) and she immediately latched on to the book - her first one without pictures.  The story is well told and is a great allegory.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have read from this author. Loved the storyline! I plan to purchase another book by this author.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Not much to say...I LOVE this movie!  It's just so romantic.  I also love that it's situated in my favorite city, New York around Christmas time.  How much better can you get??!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love it it all ways wakes me up at the exact time I set it for it is so awesome
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Long on action short on story line.  I expected it to be as intense as the previous Bourne movies.  Lacked any real story line and was a real disappointment.  This could have been a great story but the writers dropped the ball.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I give this book a solid three instead of a four only because it had such a happy ending.  I knew it would probably be a kind of feel good book when I got it, so I was expecting that.<br /><br />I recommend this book to people who are looking for a quick read but want something a bit more philosophical. A good break from the news, and better than a hunter games type story. It is a good story, and I enjoyed it.  Yet, I was glad I didn't spend too much more of my precious time with it. Pun.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I loved this book, until the end.  I kept hoping that Picoult was going to wrap things up, bring closure, answer the unanswered questions and she never did.  A very disappointing ending to a good read.  The book goes nowhere, but an endless circle.  The fiirst, and maybe the last Picoult I'll read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the series. This book kept my interest and I could not put it down until I read it all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really funny<br />Pigs pigs add nice girls no yes pigs can fly did you know that?? Byee
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. Could not put it down until I had read the whole book.  Cannot wait for the movie to come out.
B0013QKV9A|5.0|I enjoy listening to this cd. To me all the songs on here are good. The sound quality is also very good. recommended
B004U52VPS|1.0|Could not figure out how to play.  I bought this as a Christmas Gift and when we could not figure out to play he never touched again.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend it to anyone interested in the civil war. The acting and special effects were top notch.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This story is consistently as funny as the previous story and ...dare I say, the Home Alone 3 that we owned earlier.  This is an amazing serious for children and shows creativity in the child's mind.  My boys watch it and roll over laughing each time.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Wonderful combination of advanced astronomy based on writings of  the late respected and admired Carl Sagan.  Outstanding cast and acting enhanced by imaginative cameo by President Bill Clinton. Impossible to overlook futuristic cinematography skillfully integrated<br />with this jaw-dropping and entertaining  Completely believable partial bio-pic creates a fun and entertaining film experience with longevity.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works well, but as a new user of digital books, had some issues on getting back to page I left off.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|Extremely well written and well acted.  Thought-provoking plot,always surprising and fun. Suprising combination of history and future combined with science-fiction. Enjoy and have fun!
B005R32L66|3.0|Works but on my 1.2 GHZ is not the good answer for lots of SKYPEing.  It need a higher speed wifi or streamline of software to be more efficient.
B00ADS90EQ|1.0|I like stupid humor, but this is not even stupid humor.  Only value it has is some of the music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game, just as good as PC with Endless possibilities.<br />For those who complain that the earlier version was not good try and think AGAIN.So far I've built A mountain house in an amazing world and a huge castle which I'm working on currently.0.5.0 is great and 0.6.0 is coming soon !<br />If you are a person who likes fun interactive games than this is for you .<br />In one sentence this a MUST BUY GAME.
B002R5HR70|1.0|I love the movie , for years, but  trough amazon video it  is terrible. Sounds delays as long as 3-5 sec, so you see they open a mouth ,you expect to hear your loved song but you hear a voice of  the other men. Really got  you nervious . Few times it was freezing , tried to finish next day- the same .I feel sorry , next time 'll rent at blockbuster.
B005FNJL7K|5.0|Beautiful rendition of the great music Howard Shore composed for the LOTR trilogy - excellent!  I highly recommend this for anyone who loved the movies.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|there is a problem with the camera calibration you need a lot of room the get two players into the game as teams<br />you need at least 7 feet away from the camera for two people 6 feet is fine for one person at a time to play each other
B008LD09LS|3.0|It's a cool toy and a great idea.  I really like the idea that it's a Linux built on the chip that controls the copter.  But I only could get 5 to 6 minutes on a full charge and if there is the slightest of breezes you can't fly this.  Now I know you can get spare batteries but 90 minutes to charge for 6 minutes of play is just not worth the price of this.  I'm getting a copter with a bigger battery to do the same thing.  The connection between your phone or tablet is a BIG COOL FACTOR but it's one of the reasons you can't go more than 150 feet and the low battery time.<br /><br />Like I said, it's cool.  Just not for me.
B004DK49DW|3.0|Was pretty disappointed. Only two or three songs I liked that were like old Social Distortion. Others were too main stream.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|What is there not to like? its a shame its ended. Lets hope the actors go on to new roles as good as this series is.
0307744434|5.0|This is a love story. But not the one the back flap would have you believe.<br /><br />No, this book is a love story about the circus itself, and the patrons who adore it. We are given glimpses into several characters within the circus, and several characters outside it and how the circus affects them. The book's description would have you believe this story is about the dueling magicians, Celia and Marco, but it's so much more than that.<br /><br />Halfway through this book I was beginning to be frustrated at the lack of character development or plot progression. We barely know a thing about Celia, other than her appearance (dark brown, curly hair and wide eyes). And that she has a nasty temper and a dick for a father. Marco is slightly more interesting, an orphan \\"adopted\\" by the man in the gray suit, loves his books and lives a solitary, scholarly life. But still, not a lot of details or personality building to know WHO these \\"main characters\\" are...<br /><br />But then it struck me. There's a chapter about halfway through the book, when a tarot card reader (Isabelle, Marco's lover for a time) is reading for Celia and the fortune in the cards is not for Celia, but for the circus itself as a whole.<br /><br />I suddenly understood! The main character in this book is not Celia or Marco; the main character is Le Cirque des Reves, The Circus of Dreams.<br /><br />Duh.<br /><br />Once I let go of that and I let myself just enjoy what I was reading (or listening to, as I switched between the beautiful narration by Jim Dale, and reading it myself) I was able to sink into this book the way it was intended to be read; as a gateway to a magical, enchanting circus beloved by so many:<br /><br />\\"I find I think of myself not as a writer so much as someone who provides a magical gateway , a tangential route for readers to reach the circus. To visit the circus again, if only in their minds, when they are unable to attend it physically. I relay it through printed words on crumpled newsprint, words that they can read again and again, returning to the circus whenever they wish, regardless of the time of day or physical location. Transporting them at will. When put that way, it sounds rather like magic, doesn't it?\\"<br /><br />I could picture the goings on of this circus in my mind's eye with perfect clarity; something I think is rare in a novel these days. So many authors just leave descriptions by the wayside, or give us enough of a canvas that we fill in the smaller details ourselves (whether that's good or bad is entirely of your own preference). I've never wanted a caramel apple more than when the author walks us through the circus. I could smell ginger and cream, feel the chill in the ice garden, the sway of the boat of books on the sea of black ink. This book is a tease to your senses, and it is magic.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern is about my age (late-twenties/early thirties) and I often found myself wondering while reading this book, if she was a child of the Harry Potter generation; a child who did not discover the love of reading until JK Rowling introduced us to the boy who lived. She seemed to illicit the same love and enchantment that washed over me when I was little and first picked up that series (having never read for pleasure until Potter, at age 12). I like to think that Morgenstern too grew up loving Hogwarts, her story just has the same whimsy and flair I would expect from someone who grew up reading those books. But I digress.<br /><br />This book is enchanting if it finds the right reader, and for me, it snuggled deep into the recesses of what I look for in a book; to be entertaining, enchanting, and engaging.<br /><br />Not every 5 star book has to be an earth shattering, personality changing event, and I believe that's why so many people have rated this book poorly, feeling the plot gets lost or there's a lack of substance to the story. But if that's how you felt, I'm afraid you missed the point.<br /><br />Some booksare just there for you to be enchanted by, to help you escape reality, to help you dream...<br /><br />Bon Reves.are just there for you to be enchanted by, to help you escape reality, to help you dream...<br /><br />Bon Reves.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works great--allows me to use all my old adapters with my new macbook air without issue.  The magnets hold it on the cord fine, so it doesn't fall off.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|attach files and pics and view on all my devices is really handy when I want to show pictures to my friends and family
B0031RAOVY|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE I LIKED IT SO MUCH I ALSO GAVE AS A GIFT. VERY TOUCHING AND HEART WARMING FOR PET OWNERS.
1400032717|4.0|a good book but hard and sad to read. This requires eleven more words but I don't have anything else to comment
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Vintage Jack Reacher. The reader is not disappointed because Reacher is Reacher...always. Beginning the book this time as a hitchhiker, Reacher finds himself in a peculiar situation, but the twists and turns keep the reader turning pages and tuned in throughout.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out to help cut down the boredom of a long flight.  Iis one of my most favorite books. I believed in this book, and I wondered how I would do if I had faced one tenth of his situation. To me there is a very fine line between fact and fantasy in ones mind, therefore I believe in both stories.  This book is a &#34;Can't put it down&#34; book.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book is helping me move (slow but steady) from my hoarding background to a new way of living! Exciting!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it because it is fun and addicting and educational and fun I like the app if I were you I would get it
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|The claymation gets better with every movie Tim Burton does. I love the extra plot line & monsters in the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|as a matter of fact I can't rip them away from it to do anything they are supposed to do.
0545265355|5.0|i didn't notice when i ordered it that it was a hardcover...was a wonderful surprise!  great to do business with!!
B00511PTWM|5.0|I like the adjustmant and its flexability to move the head to different positions as needed. Works well and is buile solid.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Great movie.  I have watched it several times now and it is still funny every time.  Defiantly not one to watch while the kids are around.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is well made, sturdy, nice pockets and comfortable for my son to wear even when it is packed heavy.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|M son loves to watch it all the time and specially for grown ups too. it will be watched again next Christmas.
B00AG51RU6|3.0|\\"Anybody see which way that boat went?\\" While on vacation with his family Will (Cavill) gets bad news about his luggage and his job. When his families boat gets close to a town he heads in for supplies. When he comes back to the boat he finds his family gone and also finds some uncooperative police. It is now up to him alone to find and rescue his family. After the last few movies that Bruce Willis has made I had an expectation for this going in. I was right. Pretty much just a cookie cutter action movie that he is in for about five minutes. That said the movie was pretty entertaining and I did enjoy it. Nothing really all that gripping or original but it does have a decent story line and enough action to keep you watching. If you liked the movies \\"Catch .44\\" or \\"Fire With Fire\\" then you will like this one as well. Overall, nothing amazing but it is entertaining and I enjoyed it enough. I give it a B.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is more like the old Tom Clancy.  Layered plot lots of action.  Welcome back Mr. Clancy.  We've missed you.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Good caracterisation of of the particpiants however the events are too cinetographic to increase the visual impacts of the conflicts.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Spell bounding mystery. The plots and sub plots keep you on the edge of your seat. It was hard to put the book down once i started reading it.
0062101897|5.0|I bought this for a Harry Potter fanatic friend as an xmas gift. Shipping was so fast and the book is beautifully made! Also, it is huge! A definate buy for any Potter fans out there.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was very detailed and had a lengthy plot which is normally hard to find, but my first trial was a bust because it glitched and wouldn't allow me to progress any further.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|20 to 30 pages into this book I asked myself why I was wasting my time reading a teen romance. I now have to get up for work in two hours, the book was fantastic and I will not regret my exhaustion tomorrow.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|After reading about Alice I learned in depth the emotional as well as the physically aspects of a person developing<br />Alzheimer from beginning to end. It shows how the disease affects their lives and<br />their love ones. I learned some medical info about testing and genetics of people affected.It's a short book but it makes an impact.
0385040253|5.0|the only true book for scouts and sailors and climbers and anyone who needs to tie a good knot,<br />the book of books
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My friend has this app on her ipod.  I just got this app and I luv it.  Horses are my favorite animals. I'm glad it was free.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I had read a few reviews of this book before I started and expected much worse, but was surprised when I got caught up in it in the end. Do not get me wrong, this is no where near as enthralling as \\"Storm of Swords\\" but in the end I couldn't put it down.<br /> Once you get past the first half of the book, which runs the same timeline as \\"Feast for Crows\\", New information and old friends 're appear. A few un expected twists at the end leaves me waiting, impatiently, for \\"Winds of Winter\\".<br /> Bottom line is, if you have read the other 4 books, you may as well read them all.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|This is totally the scariest movie i have ever seen!! it is the best!!! it is so creepy. i had to turn on all the lights in the entire house after it was over. i think this is scary because it can really happen and because it did happen. great movie!!!
0761171703|4.0|I glanced through the book, and liked it and think I would enjoy leisurely enjoying it. But it was a gift for my daughter who used to dance ballet, and glancing through it she was ecstatic.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|this is such a great movie!!! some parts were actually funny and not scary. but it is great and i would reccommend it. its definatly one for the collection.
B006BG7RI0|4.0|The refurbished Casablanca is better than ever. Certainly better than when it was seen in theaters. No dust, no judder, no gate weave. Can things be too perfect? The book is really informative, the table coasters a nice touch. The total package is very nice.<br /><br />The only blemish is in the nice book that comes with the package. On a late page there is a photo of three Warner execs holding Academy Awards and a fourth person, listed as 'unidentified'. He looks like Jack Benny to me (wasn't he another Warner talent?). Furthermore, in one of the commentaries it is noted that Jack Benny was the Master of Ceremonies at that Academy Award ceremony. How could this get missed???
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was attracted to the game because of its colors and patterns and I enjoy playing it. Works fine on my Galaxy S3.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book in a day, primarily because I couldn't put it down.  The author uses the platform to share the amazing, true story, of the hunt and successful neutralization of one of the world's greatest enemies, Osama Bin Laden.  He writes in such a way it makes the reader feel like the proverbial fly on the wall of the world of secret ops, and the heroic men and women who conduct them.  He accomplished this without any attempt at self-aggrandizement, as a matter of fact he portrays his role as that of just another guy, no different from any other member of the team.  In conclusion I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, but also to anyone who just enjoys an exciting read.  Remember not to start it late at night.....
B00124LFR0|5.0|I used the song &#34;Children of the World&#34; on a video I made for my children showing them growing up.  They still sing this song to reflect the 70's music - ha!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded this ap for Kindle Fire HD. It will not work! I even deleted the game and reloaded it. Same thing. It tries to load but won't. Too bad because this game is fun!
B00917IQFY|4.0|It's mature and sometimes hopeful, sometimes bitter; classic Parker songs with a great band.  Gotta say, I hate the cover, even as I kinda see the irony.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars but would have given it 10+ if I could.  I found this to be one of the BEST BOOKS written by Nicholas Sparks and I think I have read just about everything he has written.  BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed!
B0096PAA6E|4.0|The EP was more consistent.  To beat a dead horse, this comes off like a sorta blues-Prince album, in that it's all over the place in style.  And that's OK, but I'd prefer consistency, and really like his tough blues the best.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|i can not get enough of breaking bad, waiting for the season 5 release and delivery from amazon; call me an addict!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|You either love Steely Dan, or just tolerate them.  Besides the great low-key playing, tho', all the jazz approach and chords and studio sounds and adenoidal vocals, the writer's voice - as a writer - is uniquely intellectual, funny and often nasty.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|this game is waste of my time this game should be erased for wasting life and time so this game can go to h**l
0312576463|1.0|Make sure to read this novel on a surface that can be easily wiped clean, because it's oozing with white privilege! Incidentally, I'm white and privileged and even I took offense to the insular nature of this book. I guess kissing some New York Times ass in the first paragraph has paid off for Franzen.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Beautiful colors and effects.  Glad we got this for blu-ray. would suggest to any blu-ray owner to get for their library.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Movie for my 5 year old daughter. The movie wall delivered promptly with now issues and my daughter loves it. She now has the main character full costume. My wife and I enjoyed the movie as well, which is important because its been played half a dozen times.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|I got through about 45 minutes of this movie and shut it off.  It was a terrible remake.  I will watch the original, thanks.  The stripper-style dancing and swearing weren't neccesary in the classic, why is it needed here?  The actors were sub-par and made the storyline not believable.  I usually don't review movies, but felt I could save someone else from wasting their time with this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and the book was much better. I highly recommended this read. I couldn't put it down.
B000IDCJK8|5.0|This film really holds up. A great Western with a dark backstory, High Plains Drifter delivers on everything from suspense to action, one-liners to moral boundaries. A must-have for Clint fans!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Even the kids like to play this game. Good game for all ages. We were surprised by some of the challenges.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show very entertaining, twisted and graphic cant help but stay glued to the screen.  Cant wait for Season 4
B000OXHRRC|5.0|I like movies about vineyards and orchards and nature in general ... and if you throw Russel Crowe in there I like it even more. This movie did a great job of showing us the underbelly of the French vineyard trade and gave us a look at small town friendship and love. Just an enjoyable movie all around.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child's character, Jack Reacher, continues to be a GREAT read... too bad Hollywood couldn't find a more appropriate actor to play Jack Reacher!!!!
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Thought this was crap. Locke had you going throughout the whole book - if you just make friends and work social networks you, too, can sell millions of dollars worth of books on Amazon. What Jumpin Johnny leaves out - and something online news pieces chronicle as fact - is that he only saw the big jump in his sales after he spent thousands of dollars to BUY REVIEWS on Amazon!!! This guy's a total fraud.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm about 1/2 way through the book and I love it.  I look forward to getting home in the evenings from work so I can read it!  I love it when I have a book like this!  Great Read!
B007SOQBCM|1.0|this app is absolutely horrible. If you try to open a stream, it opens a random page or gets stuck at the loading circle. I would rate this 0 stars if I could. THIS APP SUCKS!!!!
B002VECLVO|4.0|This film was beautiful. It's packed with tons of emotion and I enjoyed the storyline though at times it was painful to watch.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My granddaughter (4 yrs. old) loved it, watched it over and over.  Good story about friendship, love, trust and togetherness.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|Now I can watch all four seasons of SAMCRO whenever I want, and you can bet I'll order season five, too.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Very easy to use, simple but effective .<br />Recommendable to anyone, older or young persons.<br />Free space is a great incentive.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|my son loves this game. he is 4 and has been playing with minimal assistance. my wife and I both enjoy it too
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first book and couldn't go to sleep tonight until I finished. Ready to start Book 2 tomorrow-
B006FE83UE|4.0|Gregory Peck at his best. I bought this as a gift for my college aged son (political science major). SHould be a big hit.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read for teens.  Simple storytelling but the cliff hangers are too obvious. Descriptions are thin and unless you've seen the movies the landscape is hard to envision.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a bit hard to get used to at first but once you get the hang of it, it's really fun. If you like horses you'll love this game. Have patience though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good way to pass time. Good game for kids to play. :) I play it all of the time!
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Downloaded this player to watch a movie file on my Acer Iconia tablet. Was told it would play all files. Wrong!! wouldn't play my files and locked up my tablet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this game very enjoyable and relaxing. When I want to simply unwind I go to this app. I highly recommend this app.
B00243FQFA|5.0|As a big fan of the entier sg programs I would recomend buying this at these great prices.  I have also bought SGU
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I had no idea when I purchased this book that it would be about high school kids.  At times it was sickeningly cheesy and often the feelings of these characters didn't match well with their age.  I bought it because it was rated so highly, but i'm not entirely sure why a lot of people gave it 5 stars?  I'd say it's a teenage girls book.  If you're over 20 something, don't bother.  The child sexual abuse twist is also a bit weird and I don't believe overly necessary.  It's certainly not captivating reading, but on the other hand it's not the worst book i've ever read.  Probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|makes you think gives you a challenge, good way to work the mind to keep it active.<br />Thanks for making it available.
0425252868|4.0|A great read!  An almost unvbelievable story, told in a very engrossing and literate manner.  A must for any WWII buffs.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was relatable and absolutely entertaining. I think high schoolers should be required to read this book though readers of all ages will thoroughly enjoy!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A thought provoking book about a subject that men have questioned for centuries. Having seen the lengths ancient peoples went to to not be alone at death, this book may actually answer that question, Is there a heaven?<br />And what about hell?
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|This chest rig was better than I expected it to be. I thought that the kangaroo style would make it too bulky and stick off too much from my chest, however, it is fine and creates a nice place to rest your arms when taking a break. The MOLLE attachments are tight (not too tight) which holds my dump pouch securely. I have tried to put as much stuff in it as possible to make sure it feels good. I don't have very many magazines so I put extra ammo in the unused pouches, which is nice to be able to do because there aren't any pockets for anything other than magazines. It is very easy to get off, but not so much to get it on. Especially if you are wearing a thick winter coat like I have been so far. The buckles (back swivel ones) don't feel extremely durable but haven't given me any problems so far.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this is that there is no way to attach a hydration pack. I thought it would be a big deal, however, I just wear my camelbak over this and it works fine. I still will probably find a way to sew something onto the back so I can attach my hydration. I knew this before I bought it so I can't take away any stars for this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Molle compatable<br />Easy to get off<br />Ample storage for magazines<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not hydration compatable<br />Semi difficult to get on<br />Not a ton pockets for anything other than magazines (but you can add them)<br /><br />All in all I love this chest rig. As of right now, having owned it for about 3 months and taking it out on about 3 trips, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tactical chest rig.
B007REV4T8|2.0|\\"Skyfall,\\" the latest entry of the 007 franchise, takes itself so seriously, trying to give some depth to the James Bond character. This time Daniel Craig's MI6 agent, who looks (intentionally) much older than before, is allowed to go back to his roots. Obviously this is a 007 movie envisioned by Sam Mendes, director of \\"Road to Perdition\\" (where Daniel Craig was seen). Perhaps Mendes, Craig and producer Barbara Broccoli thought it would be a nice idea for the long-running series to feature Bond (and \\"M\\" for that matter) with a past.<br /><br />Nice, had they given us a range of gadgets, a so-called Bond girl and a good (and often outrageous) story only a Bond movie can tell. What you get instead is a technically superb but ultimately dull action movie cobbled together from set-pieces of other better action flicks. Even the much praised opening 15 minutes, the best part of the movie set in Istanbul, makes us feel \\"I have seen this before.\\"<br /><br />Probably you did. Plus, the screenplay has so many lapses of logic that, when Javier Bardem's character \\"Silva\\" finally reveals the true motive for what he has been doing, I thought it was a bad joke. I didn't find his half-comical mannerism and aging make-up impressive, but what is really disappointing is his dead seriousness that is totally out of place in this franchise, making Gert Frobe's villain \\"Goldfinger\\" look more convincing.<br /><br />After all, much anticipated installment \\"Skyfall\\" suffers from its approach to the subject matter. A James Bond movie should be fun, something directors like Martin Campbell know much better.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was another great story written by Nicholas Sparks! Tough to put down....wish there was more to the ending. Maybe a fast forward on the characters. Highly recommend!
B009439HEY|5.0|I have been a fan of Genesis and Steve Hackett since the beginning.  I have enjoyed their entire body of work, but I have always had a special love for the older works (before Trick of the Tail). Steve Hackett has done a spectacular job of reworking these old tunes. Nothing will ever take away from the work that Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford and Collins did on these tunes, but Steve has taken them to a new level. His first Revisted album was good, but this is a different animal althogheter. I am still getting goose bumps listening to these tunes.  It's even more amazing when you consider that some of these tunes are over 40 years old!!  As other reviewers have said, \\"Suppers Ready\\" is a masterpiece; and I got tears of joy listening to \\"Entangled\\".  I just can't say enough about this excellent collection.  I think any old Genesis fan would be overjoyed with this recording. Five big stars for this one.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Give the rise of Susan Boyle and her beautiful voice, people cannot but like this album. It repeats some of the earlier songs and added a few new ones. Yet all resonate with vocal quality..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun!! But a warning to parents:  You'll have to beg, borrow or threaten serious, long-term punishment to get your Kindle back. &lt;smirk&gt;
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|SO glad I found Draw Something for my Kindle.  The bigger screen really makes a huge difference in the accuracy of drawing.  This is a fun app and can get addictive, especially with all the colors and updates added since it first launched.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|a fun getaway.  no intense thinking required as in so many esoteric moview.  it is just pure entertainment with a moral.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|I love all the Saw movies and this one is no exception I bought it because I want to have all six of them in my dvd collection the suspense continues ...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote! I use it for everything from clipping coupons to taking notes for the boss. I use their web clipper on Chrome to clip to Evernote, then can add additional notes of my own. I keep a running record of questions for the doctor or things that need addressing with the boss. Very handy and always available cross platform. And they keep updating it too :)!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I mean, this is no The Opportunist or Dirty Red (I declare Tarryn Fisher my favorite author) but I absolutely enjoyed the unexpectedness of enjoying it. I'm 40, for Pete's sake! Well done.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Great graphics. Awesome gameplay! Now that I understand the game I love it. It is a little like ultimate capture the flag. Cool graphics and a neat story behind every hero in the game. Give it a try!
B000HIVOFU|5.0|One of the best SACD recordings purchased; great details and separation of vocals. Will look for more Chesky recordings and titles.
1476712042|5.0|I loved the characters, their chemistry together. Finished this book in one day. Couldn't put it down. Definitely recommend this read!
B00992CF6W|4.0|The kids love building different houses, gardens and forts with it.  They also enjoy the online ability of the game.  It is a little harder to get around and building.  It took some time to figure it out, but once you do, then you can build lots.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|lalalalalalalalalala.......neighh......omg haha. i think i should get a pair of glitter shoes......a horse in tree dee...i like unicorns and they aarree pretty.
B005O7Q6FM|1.0|I ordered it and was charged for it but it wouldn't play on my computer.  I have yet to hear from tech support.
B000I186FW|5.0|This was a chilling movie about a society that allowed thier government to go too far.  The parallels to what is going on in this country right now are eerily foreshadowing.  The characters were amazing, the visual effects were stunning. This is a movie I would recommend to ANYONE!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Very nice, sleek interface, easy search tool, favorites list, song search tool  this player was a free so of the day for me, but it I'd well polished and works very well!!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|What's not to love. i now have the entire series at my fingertips. I can watch my favorite episodes whenever I want. Best of all, my sons are there with me, learning more about mom and about a place that took hold in my life when I was their age.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Was pleased to find this for a great price on Amazon and would highly recommend their digital downloads. Always available in the cloud, too.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Using a Phrase from the book, I don't live (love) it. The only reason is because I am not into going on-and-on about how to kiss a person. If you like that type of stuff, then you will love this book. It is definitely something you can't put down and I recommend it if you looking for a suspenseful read.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I would like to have the bible app with me as I am on the go.  I have found that this particular app does slow down my Tab a lot; which is why I removed it.  I would have liked to follow the daily reading plans, but it kept starting me over even though I read the verses for the daily devotion.
B006LSZECO|3.0|WELL WRITTEN, IT SURE KEPT ME READING.  AREAL HORROR STORY WITH A DISAPPOINTING ENDING,I have enough stress in my life!
B0095G5AFU|3.0|I like the app and how it works.  I like the fact that I can use different covers for the different classes that I am enrolled in.  I still would like to see some tabs inside the notebooks as there are different aspects to a class (ie like a lab) that I can insert into the notebook instead of creating a new one.  Otherwise the app works really well
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love love love this show, the DVDs came and it was just what I wanted, the DVDs were not scratched and it was in perfect condition.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I love it, but my brother-in-law (for whom this was purchased), didn't.<br />He said, &#34;I don't really listen to popular music anymore.&#34;<br />I said, &#34;Wha-? This is NOT 'popular music'. You mean you only listen to instrumental music now.&#34;<br /><br />Bingo.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I have no children and bought this book to help a friend with his 13 year old. It consolidated 60 years of medical and psychological studies into one readable book. I found the information useful for myself in understanding what motivated me to succeed and have suggested it to my friends as a must read book on how to be happier and more successful and to overcome a bad childhood.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille has written another winner in The Panther.  I thought with John Corey being married, it might hamper his character somewhat, not true!  The action in Yemen is fast and furious!
B007NZQU72|5.0|LOVE this book.  Love Elaine Aron for being such a pioneer with HSP.  After 46 years of living, it all makes sense after reading this book.  Changed my life.
0316069434|5.0|I have been following Harry Bosch for quite a while and always look forward to a new story.  Michael Connelly wrote another winner!
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Pink does solid, personal music.  To a greater extent than seems usual these days, Pink's musical message sounds genuine.  Do not make the mistake (as apparently some have done) of dismissing this album as synthesized, voice modulated bubble-gum kid stuff.  It's far from that.  Pink just isn't one of the plastic retail barbie singers.  Buying this album for your 9 year old kid is about as smart as buying him or her a bottle of tequila.  Don't.<br /><br />Buy this for yourself.  Every song is good.  Every song is sincere.  This is the classic Pink sound, with the raw honesty that she brings.  It can be a bit shocking, which I think is part of the point.  She's poking at our sensitive spots and she has pretty good aim.  If this album were a bottle of booze, it would be tequila.  And not some $150 bottle of high end stuff.  Oh, no.  Pink has bite.<br /><br />Come to think of it, a tipple or two of tequila would be just right with this album.<br /><br />The vinyl is on two records.  No digital download (bummer!).  No insert, either.  But, the sound is good.  That's what counts.
B009MO57H6|4.0|A fast paced sequel that, once again, leaves an ending open to continuation. This time the previous enemy becomes an ally to fight a greater evil. Resident Evil fans will enjoy this continuing chapter.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I can't stop singing these songs in my head.  I really enjoyed this movie and I don't watch glee.  It was much better than I expected.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Grishams books and this is typical. He is not only a great author but he has a vivid imagination which sets him apart .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another great season of the Walking Dead!  Man, if you love zombies then this series is the show for you.  Won't disappoint!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Read the book and was very excited to see this show come out.  The actors fit the characters perfectly!  Will buy the next season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|some were excellent and some were great and some were not good at all read the first few chapters and then put down
B00A757EFW|3.0|Not a bad game.  I do enjoy it but it does not hold my interest for very long.<br />It is a little slow and not as easy to move around as some of the others.  Just ok.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|This album is pure energy, a fury that will engulf you. The vocals sound very demonic, never heard anything like it.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|So I like Sci-Fi movies, but I got confused at one point but went with it hoping it would get more clear, but then stopped caring.<br />The movie did not feel important enough to care about any of the characters. The character development was basically created in flashbacks if you need an example. I also felt making Joseph-Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis was very distracting, he looked strange, sometimes it looked like he had lipstick on. I don't really recommend this movie.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  Really tests your patience.  I like that you are not timed and can take your time to make your move (at least on the levels I've played so far).
1423124960|5.0|My 5-year-old loves the book! I read her one story every night and she gets to pick which one she wants to listen to. Book uses good quality papers!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A Christmas classic to be sure. Charles Dickens is an amazing author if you haven't read it yet pick it up its worth the read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found Wool Omnibus Edition quite engaging. I have purchased no. 6 and no. 7.  I am reading no.6.at the moment.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised with how funny and clever this show is.  The characters are very developed and lovable. Great story line. Love it!
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I liked this season but Season 1 had me so addicted that I bought this season's copy on Amazon. I would suggest that if you are used to HD then spend the extra money to get it in HD because the regular copy can look like regular tv if your internet connection is slow.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas and it was a hit! Neatly packaged and worth every penny. Great show!
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|I've always liked the movie. It's a modern classic with heavy doses of subtext if you know how to read it. The DVD itself is adequately entertaining. It includes the movie, commentary and a short &#34;Making of ...&#34; style documentary.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|She is so down-to-earth and has a great voice. This is a beautiful albun that expresses a wide range of emotions.
B004U52VPS|5.0|grandson loves this item and stays busy with it .  good quality and great price ..I would recommend this to any kid
0345803493|5.0|i loved fifty shades darker. i am looking forward to the next one. all my friends are reading the series as well.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Paid for it... will not even open up to try it out! can you say REFUND AMAZON???!!!<br /> Pretty disapointing when an expensive app wont work as advertised.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Say goodbye to the clones of Ace Frehley (Tommy Thayer) and Peter Criss (Eric Singer). Now, welcome the REAL Thayer and Singer, unleashed on the new KISS record Monster.<br /><br />Monster, the twentieth studio album of KISS, \\"has no symphony orchestras, boy choirs, keyboards, outside producers or songwriters,\\" as Gene Simmons has stated. Simmons is telling you the truth. Well, for the most part. Track three, Freak, has a piano solo (performed by Brian Whelan) mixed in beautifully with the creative and personal lyrics executed by Paul Stanley (with the help of Tommy Thayer in the songwriting department) as if Stanley really is the character's song! Stanley and Gene Simmons may have taken KISS into a league different from that of their heroes (most notably The Beatles and The Rolling Stones)--but it is on songs like Freak where Stanley and Simmons (along with Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer) show that, as musicians, there is far more to them than just pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Speaking of Tommy Thayer, it is Monster where Thayer becomes his own self. Even on Sonic Boom, Thayer's guitar solos replicated those of Ace Frehley's. On Monster, however, Thayer develops his own style. While the song that Thayer sings off of Monster (Outta This World) replicates Ace Frehley's Shock Me in tone, it is only to a small extent. Thayer borrows from the talent of Ace Frehley (who is believed to have inspired Thayer to become a guitarist when he was still in high school), but he does not plagiarize it or try to become KISS' original Spaceman. No; he simply takes his inspiration and makes something original out of it. It is a breath of fresh air, and it gives real authenticity to the current incarnation of KISS. No longer is the current incarnation a tribute to the original incarnation. The current incarnation (in spite of how desperately they need to give brand new characters, make-up, and costumes to Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer) are finally taking themselves to a higher level that the band has never explored before. They are doing this boldly, with Monster being produced by Paul Stanley (the album's only outsider next to Brian Whelan, Greg Collins, is the co-producer and engineer) and all of the songs being written or co-written by Stanley, Gene Simmons, Tommy Thayer, and/or Eric Singer (on the record that finds Singer, for the very first time, writing songs with KISS!)<br /><br />Monster is missing some things: and to some people, that will be a good thing. To others, it will be a bad thing. For example, if ballads like Beth and Forever are at the top of the list for your favorite KISS songs, Monster may disappoint you: there is not one single ballad on it. This may be a deal breaker for some people: however, in my opinion, the absence of ballads from Monster allows KISS to spread their wings and fly. The absence of ballads from Monster appear to be an appropriate step for the band to take, given the flesh and blood that they show on Monster as a hard rock band becoming harder, yet not shying away from their original selves. Monster stands completely on its own, which is effective in that it allows the current incarnation of KISS to grow into something bigger and better, rather than restricting them in their growth as a band.<br /><br />Second, there may be fans who find themselves homesick for the 70's era of KISS, music that was richly executed so powerfully that Ace Frehley has gone on to become known as one of many \\"guitar legends.\\" This nostalgia was, in my opinion, a part of what helped Sonic Boom climb to #2 on Billboard: it captured the original 70's sound of KISS. The brand new sound of KISS that Monster offers may be too much of a goodbye to the original KISS for some fans. I can empathize with this, and I think that most of us would agree that Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley have milked the KISS legacy. But, if you want to search for optimism in the milking, you will see that Simmons and Stanley have driven KISS far away from being a tribute band to themselves. If it makes any of you feel better, I did not start following KISS again until I heard Monster...<br /><br />Last, but not least, some of KISS' greatest songwriters--Jean Beauvoir, Desmond Child, Diane Warren, etc.--are nowhere to be found in the songwriting credits for Monster. And it was songwriters like Beauvoir, Child, and Warren who gave KISS some of their greatest songs: Heaven's on Fire. Uh! All Night. Who Wants to be Lonely. Turn on the Night. Nothing Can Keep Me From You. And many more. Still, with the eye of optimism, good can be found from the previously mentioned absences. That good is that Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley are pushing themselves harder than they ever have before (Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer have never written any KISS songs with band outsiders). And, through that pushing, with the help of Thayer and Singer, Simmons and Stanley have discovered what they are truly made of as musicians. In turn, you have the powerful album that is Monster; a phenomenon for KISS on its own; and in its delivering of the band from the tribute band they used to be to themselves.ibute band to themselves.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is simple, yet has all the features you need for a quick desk clock. Not too many things in the way on the free one like the others.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|For the price, this is definitely what you're looking for if you're trying to play a keyboard and mouse for PS3. As for attaching your high speed $100 gaming or wireless mouse, I don't know if they will work. I bought myself an LG usb mouse and keyboard for $20 and it works flawless in the game.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|My wife and I saw the first season 6 years ago and every episode of every season. We gave this First season as a Christmas present to one of our daughters who had it on her Christmas list.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love the different sounds and that you are able to mix them together. Very relaxing- it helps me sleep much deeper.
B008XBHBX2|4.0|Jaws is and was one of the great classic Movies that made movies fun to watch. Kids loved it but ....i dont like the profanity. Had to mute out the obscenity. No kids under 13 for this movie.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Es una obra de arte, musicalmente hablando es fabulos. Tienes canciones que llevan sus orígenes musicales y se remontan a la realidad que vivimos hoy en día

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I read the book The Game of Thrones and loved it and the 1st episode on dvd and I thought  was amazing.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|When I like, I like!  this book is VERY good and explained well the atmosphere of the URSS/Russia during the communist regime.<br />Being myself from Russian origin, I appreciated reading something so true and poignant from a country that I love dearly.<br />The story is a little romanticized at the end, but never mind that!<br />It is certainly a book who will tell people who do not know, what happened there at the time, a long time!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp is, as always the character he portrays. He is expert in presentation and is skillful in portraying the very best. Add this to your collection.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I think I already review this book month ago, but here it is again:<br />This book is OK, but nothing else.  it wants to be pornographic but does not succeed.  It is barely erotic, and in fact, it is a love story disguised...<br />I read it because of the marketing of the book, but in fact I was a little disappointed.
B003SI9WYG|3.0|Burton doesn't falter in his imaginative screen magic. This movies is artistically presented for you pleasure. The purchase is well worth it.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Supposed to drop today, but on his facebook page (post dated January 5) that the album release is now scheduled for June 2013.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game has a simple gameplay but is still enjoyable. It was kind of disappointing when I found out you had to purchase the second half though.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Esto se llama canciones y se llama cantante, ella sabe lo que es cantar y escribir, hacer sus propias canciones y escribirlas es algo de admirar amo a esta mujer es lo mejor de lo mejor en la muscia! mas de 200 millones de copias vendidas, la mejor vendedora de discos en la historia de la musica! im so proud of her!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love this game. Just wish it let you gain more games when you win a game rather than taking away from the number of games you are allowed to play during a specified time limit.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This is a classic racer game that does not have any angry hogs, squawking birds, or first-person massacres.  It took me a little bit to figure out how to turn the car around corners (hey, I learned these electronic games by leaning on a pinball table), but once I did, I had a huge grin for hours.  I highly recommend this for the young and young at heart, though your 8 year old will probably roll his eyes at this game LOL.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is awesome.  I started out reading the Percy Jackson series and I loved it. Now he made a book with new characters the link to Percy Jackson. Can't wait to finish reading the next HEROES OF OLYMPUS.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I have ever played better than the iPhone version very very fun.would recommend this game to all my friends
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It is a great game with fantastic visuals. It is also overly addictive with great upgrading. I've only just started but already it's really fun. Just...WOW
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Though I never served in the Special Forces or like service component, I am a retired Army Officer. I recognize much of the material that is referenced. It made me proud of my time in the military and proud that the tradidion continues!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Obviously you would need to read the other wimpy kid books, but, this one is by FAR the best!!!! My sister purchased it for me on my birthday and I LOVE it it was very funny I laughed very hard several times!!! I recommend this book to we'll first people who have already read the other books in the series and to people who like comics....the only bad thing is for $7.00 pretty much I finished it in 2 days so I wish they were cheaper but definitely give this book a try :-)
B001H1SVO8|5.0|how did I skip this movie? Watched it for the social reference I felt I was missing. It's a masterpiece. Who knew? Apparently everyone but me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|American authors like Vince Flynn have restored crime and adventure fiction to new heights with series characters and there are very few series characters that match Mitch Rapp.  Certainly none surpasses this series.
B007JWC8ZC|5.0|This movie isn't just one of the top movies on Viet Nam but one of the best movies ever made!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Childs is one of America's best writers and he hits a home run with every new Reacher story.  This book follows the same path--gripping, fast-paced and exciting.<br /><br />It's a shame that the casting of the recent movie so detracts from Childs's carefully wrought hero.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella does it again - entertains, bewilders, frustrates and still manages to surprise the reader - a must read indeed
B006LSZECO|5.0|The last part of this book is revitting.  Great charcters and plot.  It would make a great movie. Good read.
B008F9E306|5.0|This new album by T.I. is the BOMB!! How ANYONE that likes hip hop or rap can give this album anything less than 4 stars must really not have  listened to  the same album that I listened to! This album is very,very good! It has good beats, good lyrics, and he is  going  hard! I am a T.I. fan,  but I really did not like \\"No Mercy\\". It lacked a LOT IMO. Now, THIS album has made up for that! It is as  good if not better than \\"Paper  Trail\\". T.I. can call himself \\"THE KING\\" because he is! THIS IS A CLASSIC, MUST HAVE ALBUM!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Wanted man. A good reacher book until he gets to the gov. Hotel. Seemed like a different writer. Reacher works alone, making decisions. Not so after hooking up with the people in the hotel. Still good reading.
B000641MB6|5.0|Always loved this one, when i was a child, it was because the Santa really did look real and I believed.  When I grew up, I still loved it because of the HOPE and REAL emotion going on as we all want to believe in Santa, even when we know he is just a good feeling in all of us.  Sort of a guardian angel out there at Christmas time.  This movie makes me happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a little over my 3 year old's head, but he is quickly getting the hang of it.  My 5 year old, on the other hand is quite the little runaway with the surfer dude.  Fun to watch them play and even attempt on my own.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good app and I would recommend this game for anyone. I like the game for its horse's color. Lolgamer4life1 is the best
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My 5 year old and I LOVE to play this together.  She will pick one card and I will find the match or vise versa.  We could spend HOURS playing if I let us :)
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It help me on some words but not most that i needed to know and a little frustrating looking for words
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works greats, the features are definitely high definition.  Love that I can connect with my friends using my Kindle Fire HD.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Epic<br />Epic it as it should be is all i can say for this novel good job Mr Rick riordan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great for kids. my 2 year old loves watching the horsie. I think it fun and entertaining. its so realistic too. I cant say anything but good stuff about it
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love the addicting setup and game play it is so fun. I will definitely tell anyone who thinks about  getting this game to get it.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Was a good space adventure. Kept you reading and wouldn't let go. Better than most by a long shot by far
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's easy to use & great to have at my fingertips.  I like the mobility of having it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00001W9G0|3.0|A nice story though somewhat dated by today's standards, Well  worth adding to a person's DVD library and fun to watch as well
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just added this but it's nice to be able to look up the weather wherever I am or going to be.  I also look up what it's like where family members are.
B007P7UF0G|3.0|Franco Nero's performance is a bit on the stilted side, but Redgrave and Harris give fine performances in this fine musical
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A truly amazing film that has fun characters, an amazing vilian with great colors and music, not to mention a great climax
B0054YIQLW|5.0|Placido Domingo at  his very best.  the location is beautiful and adds so much to this classic opera,,a great buy!!
B004NIFK9Q|4.0|People don't care so much about manners any more (or perhaps don't have any) so novels of manners are quite unfashionable. Still, this book has a lot of insight into the social conflicts and changing mores of Eduardian England, carried by an interesting plot weaving together the lives of three socially very different families: two generations of the colonial capitalist Wilcoxes, three intellectual Schelegel siblings, and the lower class Basts. A young modern editor probably would be tempted to take out quite a few words but it is very readable for us older folks who are more comfortable with classic literarystyles.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Greg should have gotten a girlfriend to. I think it is cute that Rowlly got a girlfriend but what about Greg
B002RI98BA|5.0|I'm so glad I read this before the \\"Lincoln\\" movie comes out here in South Africa. I've recently been on a biography binge, first reading about Benjamin Franklin, then Thomas Jefferson before starting this book.<br /><br />This detailed multi-biography flows like an engrossing novel, including not only the life of Abraham Lincoln but also his main political rivals whom he included in his executive Cabinet. I will forever equate the word magnanimous with the name of Lincoln, that's how deeply the detailed narrative etched itself in my memory.<br /><br />After 4 days and some nights of reading, I was left with the feeling I had witnessed the sadly shortened career of a truly great man.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I think it was fun. my sister would love to play it some time. But I wish you didn't have to pay for blunt.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is really good. I really enjoyed it. Also if I was that guy I would of not did this and I can't even see my self  kidnapping someone.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I received this product I was unhappy with the appearance and contacted Lifeproof directly (as the inside information instructed).  After giving my serial numbers I was told this product was a counterfeit and obviously not eligible for any warranty repair or replacement.  I was also informed that Amazon was not an authorized dealer for Lifeproof and I needed to return this product and inform Amazon immediately.  I have returned this product and am still waiting for my refund.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal.  It was thought provoking, sad, and very well written.  I lost a little momentum, however, as I got about halfway through.  Still enjoyed it.  Just found myself able to tear myself away more easily.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Gripping with twists and turns that keep you guessing until the final page!  You also learn about Norway and its way of life.
0762445262|5.0|What can I say?  My son's a Batman fan. This is a quirky addition to his dorm room and he loves it.  It is not big, but you'd know that if you read the full description.  It was exactly the size we'd expected and it works just fine.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is awesome! I love the quick wit and humor. Every episode gets better and better as the characters develop. I was surprised that I could enjoy a show around law, but the writers do a fantastic job of weaving snippets of their work into the story line without fixating on the dry, boring subject that it is. Can't wait to start Season 2!
0060591714|5.0|Isabel Allende's trilogy includes 3 of the very few novels written in Spanish for young adults.  It combines  adventure, awareness of cultural and ecological issues, and an engaging coming-of-age plot, A very good read!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is a cute little puzzle game, great job by zeptolab :-). kind of like a cartoon version of quell.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good Graphics, Nice selection of horses. Like that you can train and care for your horses and compete in contests.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Very challenging game that is tons of fun.  It keeps me busy when traveling for work and keeps my mind occupied when I'm bored.
B0053O89WY|5.0|And it doesn't end -- we laugh and laugh and laugh!!  If you like Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj, Penny, and the gang, you will not be disappointed in the latest installment of laughs!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app os so fun! I love how you can compete and buy tack, horses and characters! at some points you get low on money, hut eventually earn it back
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love this show!  It's great escaping with this show.  Also, Steven Amell would be the perfect Christian Grey for the 50 Shades of Grey movie.
0062014102|1.0|This is not a book about cosmology, physics or astronomy. It is a book about the paranormal - and a dated one at that. It's been years since I've had to put a book down, but I couldn't make it past page 75. I am interested in the paranormal, but this book jumps all over the place, and is poorly written, with far too many irrelevant anecdotes. I was very disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After seeing the first movie,I decided to read the next two books in the series. Normally,I'm not a big reader, however with these two books I couldn't stop. Suzanne Collins did a great job and rekindled my enjoyment of reading
B000VXLHWG|1.0|These performances from the Mahler Festival given the last three years in Amsterdam are outstanding - one of the world's greatest orchestras in music with which they have a century history.  Conductors are appropriate - video quality is superb with the cameras usually in the right place. But production values are wretched  - no program booklet with timing information, no DVD menu, no on-screen ID of performers, etc.  And although these supposedly are 5.l surround sound, as there is no menu, there's no way to access this format.  Let us hope RCO Live fixes this mess and reissues it in corrected form.  For more comments, visit [...]  Thanks!
B005HP2JAM|2.0|Thought I was getting a movie about the exploration of a cave, but it is more about cave drawings found within a cave and the analyzing of what that would reveal about prehistoric man and animal... yet nothing scientific just ideas that scientists have though maybe could be. The cave formations were skimmed over to show the same drawings over and over again. It is a 90 min movie with 40mins of information just being repeated multiple times. My husband who never can sleep during any movies found it difficult to keep his eyes open and I felt I was back in history class. Some camera shots were pretty but many were grainy so it's not that I can brag about the view either. Might be good for those highly interested in the paleo era... but make sure that is what you are looking for before purchasing.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Tense plot kept me on edge throughout.  Haggis' direction kept the story flowing. Russell Crowe's performance was flawless; the short appearance of Liam Neeson was quite well done - loved the interplay between two top actors.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very nice book. I liked how  the story started. Not the typical love story. Highly recommended to all hopeless romantic out there.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The legendary score and lyrics are given new life in this beautifully raw version. Every member of the cast contributes to the power of the ensemble.  Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks are outstanding.  Loved Russell Crowe's solos, especially the prayer-like version of Stars, which gives a whole new insight into the plight of Inspector Javert; and Hugh Jackman's Valjean is commanding throughout.<br /><br />I wish it were longer and had included more of the interchanges between characters.  Maybe a full version will follow before long; meantime, this is an empowering soundtrack.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I love this game so much I cant stop playing it also my sister loves it. to this is a great game for anyone
B002JVWQSW|2.0|One of the discs in the case can't be read. Kinda makes buying the &#34;complete&#34; first season pointless. Probably just a glitch.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an excellent show. PBS, masterpiece, British period film that is not too theatrical or frou frou. Highly enjoyable.
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|Touching the Void really doesn't need a review.  It is one of the greatest survival/adventure stories in the literature, and a Kindle edition was long overdue. This first person account of disaster, self-sacrifice, heart-wrenching choice and refusal to give up in the face of overwhelming difficulties vividly captures the emotions and struggles of those involved.  Joe Simpson is a talented and sensitive writer who went on to produce a number of excellent books on mountaineering (indeed, one can make a case that he is a better author than mountain climber), but Touching the Void is easily his best.  Plan to read it in one sitting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was a very touching story. I liked the style of the writing. I really identified with the main characters feelings.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is too slow moving for my taste. . .It is a game that I was easily tired of.
0385536828|4.0|Stay with the story.  The first page grabbed me then the book slowed down far more than the first page led me to expect.  By the time he has slowly introduced everyone it is interesting and intriguing.  Too much said will spoil the story.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|A surprisingly good watch!  Sure, it's a leap of faith ... but if you're willing to take it, you're in for some fun. A cult classic.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great story, strong character development, intersting story line and young adult romance. The poetry was beautiful and well integrated into the story as well. I loved it ans was so happy she wrote a second book.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|A good movie ... but a little bit of a let down. It's slow and drawn out in some parts.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My grandson loves Star Wars and Legos, so I bought him this carry case to go with the Legos I bought him.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This was so much better than I had anticipated ... very fantastical (is that a word?) A fun &#34;movie night&#34; selection.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|Worst movie ever!!!! No plot, stupid acting, dumb jokes. Come on man, are you for real? You're wasting my time.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|It just kept dragging on and I kept hoping it was going to get better, but it just didn't.  I didn't get it, weird and didn't make sense.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Once I started reading it I couldn't stop. Made me smile and cry. My mom and sister are reading it now. Cannot wait for the movie!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|cant wait for part 2. love the graphics and game play. love the mysteries included. really hard to put down once you begin it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Almost felt like I was hiking along with her. While I occasionally said \\"you are so stupid\\" out loud, I couldn't help but admire her gumption.  Always wanted to find out what she was going to get herself into next.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a book everyone needs to read at least one or more times.<br />Viktor Frankl  has given us invaluable<br />tools for living.  His experience has<br />brought Logotherapy into being.<br />He gives hope a whole new meaning.
0156013983|5.0|Will read French up against English to see whether same story is coming through.<br />to brush up on French and storytelling.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Like the ability to zoom in on the gameplay. So far so good. I also like the option of skipping tasks if you desire
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed all three books. A must read.  Not overly explicit as some were saying.  Im glad i purchased and read for myself.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|too bad they didnt kill this chick in twilight. cant tell if this isnt twilight with this whiny depressing no talent hack kristen stewart.  this movie was painful to attempt watching. i thought the other cast would make up for the always depressed stewarts lack of range but i was wrong. total waste of time as i couldnt watch more than a few minutes of it. my 13 and 15 yr old daughters thought it horrible as well
141694737X|5.0|I purchased this as a book for my 1 year old son.  He loves the lift-a-flap books since they really let him interact with the books.  He loves this book!  He loves seeing what is underneath the flaps and it's not too long for a 1 year old.  Definately one of his new favorite books!
B007L6VR12|5.0|Ah, the joys of adolescence.  You are hounded by your parents, chastised by your peers and scorned by your first love.  You are misunderstood, underappreciated and overprotected and at the end of the day, your life is just now starting to `begin' and you have a whole lot of life left to live, so you better get used to it now!<br /><br />I don't know why I'm drawn to movies about childhood, but I certainly am.  Maybe it's the fact that it is a part of my life I often reflect on, or maybe it is because I can see it starting to form in the eyes of my children, but the bottom line is that these films truly impress something upon me, truly speak to the core of me.  Like Jonze did in a more fantastical way, and Zietlin did in a more earthy way, Anderson proves that he understands the misunderstood in a more humorous and charming way.<br /><br />Yes, Wes Anderson understands what it means to be a child.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Wes.  I'm not a rabid fan.  I don't bow down at the altar of Wes Anderson.  I thought `Rushmore' was uneven and `The Life Aquatic' slightly vacant, but `Fantastic Mr. Fox' was fantastic (pun intended) and `The Royal Tenenbaums' is one of the best comedies of the past decade.  For me, `Moonrise Kingdom' is his finest film and, without question, a masterpiece!  A beautifully intricate screenplay (so much subtle depth), a brilliant ensemble (Willis!  Norton!  Swinton!), not to mention two leads that truly understood the balance needed to sell all aspects of their situation.  Gilman and Hayward were outstanding to say the least, full of such adolescent truth and wonderment mixed with the sparks of individuality that make themselves prevalent at that ripe age of change.  Mix in with that Anderson's keen use of visuals (the sets, the costumes) and the beautiful score and you have a pitch perfect film from start to finish.<br /><br />What makes `Moonrise Kingdom' so insightful is the subtle way in which Anderson is able to bleed his themes into all aspects of his film.  When you consider the core story regarding Sam and his relationship with Suzy (the birth of adolescence through the pangs of first love) and then you see that same central theme trickle into the depiction of the adults around him, whether they be the lonely Captain Sharp (a magnificent Bruce Willis) or the repressed Laura Bishop (McDormand) or the childlike innocence of Scout Master Ward (a beautifully toned turn from Edward Norton), Anderson took the time to develop so much substance behind every conversation.  There is so much to glean from the development of story here that it demands repeat viewings.<br /><br />The key being that this film is wonderful enough to deserve them!<br /><br />And that is certainly key here as well.  Wes Anderson has a distinct style of filmmaking.  He is clever and witty and possesses a charm that makes his films rest warmly on the palate.  Using his sharp sense of direction, Anderson creates such a welcoming format for his tale.  He has perfected his approach and delivered a film that is tonally perfect, one that pulls us in and holds us close and urges us to keep watching with gentle prods that assure us, like a parent does a child, that we truly want to see how this story unfolds.of his film.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the kindle app! I don't have to spend tons of money on a kindle device to enjoy reading kindle books. I have an Android phone and tablet that I use this app on. I really enjoy not having to carry all of my nerdy, techie, text-book style books all over with me. I mainly use them as references and it's nice to have them all in one convenient location. I also save money on not having to buy the physical copies (sometimes). Very solid app. I can not think of a single time it has crashed on my Galaxy S III or my Nexus 7 tablet.<br /><br />I gave this app 4 stars because I think it can still use some improvement. If eReaders or their apps are going to replace the physical book then they need to be programmed to do so.<br /><br />Here are a few ideas that I think could accomplish this:<br /><br />1) Cross referencing - My biggest issue is there is a serious lack of cross referencing capabilities. This is most likely of little concern to those who read novels from cover to cover. It can be more of a problem for people like me. When I want to read something at location A and then cross reference with information in location B it's extremely difficult to do. I have to actually change the page I am viewing and then do so again to go back to my original location. An app that has done this well is, the LDS Gospel Library which has amazing cross referencing functionality. You can browse to location A pop open another window and browse to location B. You now have two windows open and can easily jump back and forth between the two. In fact, you can open multiple windows which can be very useful.<br /><br />2) More color options for highlighting - It would be nice to have multiple options for highlighting instead of just yellow. Let me choose what color I'd like instead of just yellow and also allow for underlining instead of always highlighting.<br /><br />3) Linking locations - This could go along with cross referencing but the option to link locations together for faster referencing. This way I don't have to find my cross-references again when I return and re-read material. It would be a time saver and a huge convenience.eferencing. This way I don't have to find my cross-references again when I return and re-read material. It would be a time saver and a huge convenience.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|This had great potential. But it had so little intrigue or suspense. Writing about stories within the story was so confusing at times. I had to stop and go back to see who he was writing about. Would not recommend at all.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|When I looked at the charging cable for the headset, I was immediately concerned about it being proprietary and easy to loose so I ordered the charging case. Although a bit large, it is much easier to keep track of, safely stores the earpiece, and keeps it charged. I haven't used the original charging cable since I got the charging case. Since I posted my review regarding how easy it might be to loose it, I've already heard from someone who has. Now I don't worry about loosing anything and it is always charged and ready to go.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Plot was weak.  Acting was lacking.  The movie tried to make it on action and shart appearances by big name actors
B000A0K2JO|5.0|had to do a bios update and could not find a ps/2 keyboard anywhere. hope i don't have to buy another one...lol
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|To me, this book started out as a feature in Seventeen Magazine and turned into a Lifetime movie. While Hopeless was entertaining (I couldn't put it down) and a quick read (literally took me 2 days) after the first surprise twist (that wasn't really a surprise) it became kind of predictable.<br /><br />*UPDATE: I realize it was so predicable because this is pretty much The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but from a girls perspective (enter mush, a snarky best friend who thinks calling each other \\"whore\\" is a term of endearment. But I digress.<br /><br /> The writing was great for a YA book, although I don't really understand the NC-17 rating (vampires and brooding teenagers and sadly most 7th graders are more sexed up then this book). But nonetheless, it was overall a good read. Especially since it was only $4.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Best first shooter game on any tablet ever. It has awesome graphics and the weapons can be made during the game.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was a very entertaining movie, lots of action, Bane was a beast as well. I just couldn't help but giggle at moments of the film. Bale makes an interesting Batman, it's just that that Bat Voice of his got really hilarious at moments in the flim.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|This album speaks to me. Know how it feels to be/feel alone while struggling with things behind my face and above my throat keeps me listening to this amazing duo. They have amazing lyrics that make u think and make u want to sing along. Twenty One Pilots is perfect!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|If you're looking for the same tone as the Stallone/Schneider combo, you're in for a disappoint. This movie packs a punch, loaded with effects and awesomeness. There needs to be a sequel or a continuation of Dredd into the Mega City
B00AHXIC50|5.0|As an ex teeny bopper, (I'm 27 now therefore I experienced the boy band boom of the late 90's) Unorthodox Jukebox invoked the feelings and emotions of my tumultuous adolescence. There were a few ecstatic screams in my household followed by episodes of playing this album on a loop for several days. Here I thought I grew out of that stage of my life. I guess one can grow old, but never really grow up. With heartfelt lyrics and catchy synth-pop beats, Bruno and the Smeezingtons have awakened the fan in me. Everyone needs this album in their life. I do not own DooWops and Hooligans, it seemed way too teen pop for me. His sound and lyrical content has matured significantly. I will now end my review in true fan style I LOVE U BRUNO MARS *throws undies*
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first in a series of 5, this book will suck you in leaving you wanting to plow through the next four. A must read for fans of dystopian future novels.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|almost as good a raiders of the lost ark.  i look forward to the next movie in this series !
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have just started using it and haven't had time to figure out everything. So far I have my menus for the week and I have my shopping list. I did install it on my cell so that I can use it from there if I leave my Kindle at home
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a fun read similiar to fifty shades of gray.  Not quite as explicit.  I have read some of her other books and this one was her best.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love spider solitaire. I don't like the ads, but I assume they would go away if I purchased it. Overall it is fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|I liked this game, very fun game. My sons love it. They are playing non-stop. Would recommend it to friends.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Fantastic movie with a great star studded roster. The kids were wonderful and they are definetly the stars of the movie. Lighthearted and fun. Will definetly watch again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is quite addictive and fun. I enjoy the graphics and how you can constantly do something while waiting for other goals to be completed.
B0037NB6QE|4.0|The book and characters and description of the neigborhood makes you want to go visit and walk the streets that Debbie describes.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the very large clock on my kindle (those of a certain age can appreciate this).  It will come in handy on trips.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Good acting to help understand in a small way the way an autistic person's thought and perception process is different from a non-autisitic person's.<br />Rounds out the understanding I got from the books.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I had not realized that my Kindle fire had a camera in place, so I ordered the HD camera.  It is not clear how this works.  Do I point the screen out or not?  How do I save photos?  The kindle is intuitive to a great extent, but I think that clear instructions accompanying new &#34;apps&#34; would be particularly helpful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it looks so awesome u should get it I cant get it bcuz the price............ but.i totally recomend.u getting .it
B007M45PMU|5.0|Just seen these guys on SNL playing Hey Ho and immediately loved them and their style. So I decided to download this album even though I knew nothing about them or their music and I was not dissappointed. Love it, love their sound.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love all these actresses so it was easy to like this movie. The songs were catchy and the scenes were super funny!
B000Q76K1A|4.0|This movie has you leaning into all the twists and turns... very entertaining ...will watch the other 3 sequels next.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|The audio and video quality are extremely good.  I have watched this disc no less than 15 times since I have bought it.  Amazing musicians, spectacular 5.1 mix and an excellent all around show.  Buy it!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter loves to bathe and feed her new pets! This game is easy and fun - fit for a younger child!
1451695195|5.0|To argue, from a scientific perspective, that consciousness exists outside of the human body/brain, is no easy task.  This book makes just such an argument, and, thanks to the writers' neurosurgical background, the argument is grounded in scientific fact.  What I like most about this book is that it forces us not just to 'think outside of the box'...but to consider breaking free of what we think we know...and to throw the box away!  A fresh, humble exploration of what might just be reality....
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I thought it was great really but I did not like the fact that I had to keep going back and fourth to go or get back to places. Overall a great game though I can't wait for the next one.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My kids have taken this over. They love it!<br /> Wish they had a kids version, as some of the words are hard for them or inappropriate. Also would be nice if we can have multiple accounts so each family member can have their own game going.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this, I take it with so when I travel I can use this to sleep. Works great!! It has a TON of different sounds that oyu can mix and match!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a really well written book and very hard to put down.  I hope to read another of her books next.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I bought this after seeing his interview on Opra's SuperSoul Sunday.  This book is thought provoking and I loved it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Initially, I thought I had this story figured out.  I was wrong for the most part. I was able to to read Sky's past correctly but I was wrong on the main plot. I would recommend this book to others. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little slow starting out. I encourage everyone to keep reading as it becomes very interesting!!!!! I'm very impressed!!!!
B003R50FRI|5.0|This book is an awesome read. Once you start reading you wont want to put it down. India sounds like an amazing place with amazing people! I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a great read.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Actually my Son-in-law loved it, as it was a gift for Christmas. We will want the next in the series.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The fat girl is hilarious, awsum movie. A lot funnier than I though it eas going to be. Worth renting
B002KH4KSY|3.0|The movie came in a cheap little case with no cover.  I had to make a case and cover for the movie to go on the shelves with my other ones.  They need to let people knoe the movies will not be in cases.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My two-year-old daughter absolutely LOVES this movie. She doesn't understand some of the actions and references that I don't yet want to explain, but I do have to make sure that she knows not to imitate all of the actions; (kicking in the shins, splashing water on the floor, pillow fights, etc.) My husband loves the historical references.
0670023329|5.0|I recommend this book, it makes you appreciate how good we have it in America.  It closely follows the documentary I watched on Netflix.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It's great ...I love it ! I use it 4 school in the morning so it prepares me! Like it gives me simple math problems before I can hit the snooze Button..which is fantastic ! And if u don't think that's cool it gives u other options before u hit the snooze Button:) idk... I think I'm gonna marry this app! Lol ...download now ... u should
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun but can be challenging which is all the better.  Some screens you fly through but others you think are impossible until you find the solution.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire I find is THE best book ever! It was so interesting that I never wanted to put my kindle down!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent.  Allows you to listen and read at the same time.  Multiple choices for bible versions and has reading plans and other options
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I had a tamrac bag before but with 2 bodies being carried at all times I was running out of space. This bag solves that problem and had more space to carry more lenses and accessories. Am I going to get rid of the tamrac, nope, it will carry the 5D exclusively, but the rest of the crop bodies can fit in this one.<br /><br />One nice thing, I can fit my tamron 70-200 f2.8 in it lengthwise :)
B0087HT36U|5.0|love this game, can't get enough....keep the upgrades coming.  Have it both on my tablet and on the iphone 5
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A child hood fantasy, a world of wonderful memories, a beautiful aesthetic and a very simple complicated story, believably told through the eyes of children, thus is a delightful little movie :)
B008458O3S|5.0|One of the best inexpensive apps for the kindle fire. Great puzzles with open solution possibilities which challenge the brain in a fun, addictive way.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play spider at night when I can't sleep.  It is very entertaining and I plan to take it with me on our trip to Hawaii.
B003L77G06|5.0|If you have never watched Modern Family you are missing one of the greatest comedy series of all time. You need to buy it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I bought this particular CD as a gift for my sister, I have a lot of Elvis in my CD and record collection. This album had a good selection of his hits, but since he had so many of them, it is hard to compare with other collections. Good buy.
B0053O89RY|4.0|This is again a great season of Modern Family. It is worth the money and the time to watch it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a great movie!<br />It was so wonderful to sit down and watch a great movie that didn't depend on foul language & sex to fill up the time on the screen.<br />This movie moves your heart to see the need for someone to take the time to stop and listen to their heart and in doing so, make wonderful changes in this world. We highly recommend this movie!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The graphics and 3 D effect was really worth the money. I think it is one of the best 3D movies of all time.
B003PBB4ME|2.0|I HAVE A NIKON D 300S WITH A BATTERY HOLDER ATTACHED SO IT DID NOT FIT AS PER HIGHT, HAD TO SEND IT BACK.DID NOT REALLY BOTHER TO REMOVE BATTERY HOLDER EVERY TIME I NEED TO SHOOT MOVIES.
1455502758|5.0|This lovely piece of work was painfully honest and bitingly hilarious.  It allows the reader to enter into his overwhelming reality of this fearsome disease with such intimacy. The fact that he was able to focused his energy to discuss his final dance with death (which is so rarely portrayed with such candor) at a time when most are so devastated by the pain alone, was just astonishing. This is just a beautiful book and it left me feeling deeply moved. Bravo Mr. Hitchens' for living your life &#34;out-loud&#34; until the very end.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|The server is way too slow at being able to do anything and the customers get mad and leave way too fast.  The player should be able to set up a series of actions in a row instead of having to do one action at a time.  Also the food takes way too long to make.  Finally the games upgrades cost way too much.  Diner Dash is a much better game if looking for this type of game.  This game is cute but too frustrating because of the horribly slow speed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Could not put this book down. loved the characters. can not wait to get to the next book. very entertaining.
B005AUWY90|5.0|like always, Pixar never fails to deliver good wholesome family movies and has become my 2 year old sons new favorite movie. The DVD/BLU RAY combo pack is useful when the boy wants to see the movie at grandma's house (who hasn't upgraded to blu ray yet)
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The book presented relevant studies of habit in a readable manner.  Good background information for persons who may want to modify certain behaviors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It might look terrible but even the it looks like pixels it's awesome noch or whatever rocks I thank him for making this game
B00846REIS|5.0|Better written than 50-Shades and I enjoyed it immensely.  Sylvia Day did an awesome job setting up this series.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B00004R99F|4.0|Gave this to a nephew who apparently enjoys it immensely. His mom was happy to have it for him to watch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day did an outstanding job continuing this series following Bared To You. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|After reading around 50 ebooks per year from various sources this book is the most entertaining that I have read in the last five years. The plot development and characterisation are both outstanding. The excitement and pleasure each page brings is sustained right through to the very last page.<br /><br />Stop reading this review.<br /><br />Get this book now.<br /><br />Can hardly wait for the second book - The Tower Lord.....
B006IYG5HE|4.0|For many years, Americans have been dipping into the seemingly bottomless store of crime novels from Scandinavia with noteworthy enthusiasm. Not so long ago, Stieg Larson's trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, dominated the best-seller lists almost as surely as have Harry Potter and the various Shades of Gray. Earlier, many of us got hooked on Henning Mankell's brilliant creation, Kurt Wallander -- certainly, I did, having read all of those superb Swedish detective novels. Earlier still (1990s), the best-selling Danish thriller Smilla's Sense of Snow captured wide attention, and in the 1960s and 70s there was the Swedish writing team of Maj Sj&ouml;wall and Per Wahl&ouml;&ouml;.<br /><br />Most recently, there's been a lot of buzz about a Norwegian novelist, Jo Nesbo, and his anti-hero, detective Harry Hole. The Redbreast is my introduction to Jo Nesbo's nine novels about his complex and often exasperating fictional detective. I have to say I'm impressed. Nesbo's plotting is fiendishly complex, and his insight into character runs deep. As a writer, he (or perhaps his translator, Don Bartlett) matches up to any of the other Scandinavian crime writers, and he's a damn sight better novelist than most of the Americans who write best-selling murder mysteries.<br /><br />In The Redbreast, Harry Hole finds himself on the trail of a would-be assassin. Not only is the assassin's identity unknown to him, but so is the target. To begin with, all he knows is that someone has paid a fortune to acquire what is described as the assassin's rifle of choice, and he's determined to discover who bought it, and why. Meanwhile, having screwed up a major assignment and created an international incident in the process, Hole is ordered to investigate a neo-Nazi organization and sidetrack his work on the rifle. Naturally, he ignores the orders and doggedly pursues the trail of the overpriced murder weapon. His journey yields a new perspective on Norway during World War II, when the country was occupied by Nazi Germany and many misguided young Norwegians volunteered to fight for the Third Reich. The historical references are both integral to the story and fascinating for an American whose experience of Nazism has come exclusively from books and film.try was occupied by Nazi Germany and many misguided young Norwegians volunteered to fight for the Third Reich.

B000007XUQ|5.0|The wife looked for the DVD at several stores and could not find it.  Thanks for looking after the customer.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This was the easiest app to download and use.  It works great! Thanks for having this for me to download on my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, lots of activities to keep you busy and interested!<br />My daughter loves to play too.
B001XUKFAQ|5.0|this movie is hilarious. I laughed hard the entire time. Acting is top notch and for a comedy that's amazing.
0736092269|5.0|Lots to learn and lots of great pictures and diagrams in this book. They go through tons of exercises and let you know the proper way to do them and what muscles and muscle groups you are using. If you want a working knowledge of all the muscle names and which exercises target each, this would be a great book to start with.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I have heard many things about this series from friends but don't have AMC with my cable plan.  So when I saw this for a great price I jumped on it!  My older kids and I love it!  We are looking forward to watching Season 2!
B00138GZAC|5.0|When her first two albums came out I bought them and listened to them over and over again.  This Best of Sade mp3 album is fantastic.  She is just as wonderful as I remember!
B002B3WEO4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums by Tom Petty!  Great for road trips or chillin' at home!  This album is a must have!

B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this and I enjoyed learning about the characters.  The twists were really interesting!  I recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game has some good graphics but i wish you could change from creative to survival without  making a new world.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie more than anything!  I watched it at night with headphones while my husband was sleeping.  I kepy waking him up from laughing!!!  IT IS MY FAVORITE!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Coolest game ever I think it's awesome but it's even better when purchased .. I love this awesome adventure it's got a coo mystery and even some scary parts for people that can't read this game will be challenging ... :) ;) the last part is so funny with the rat
B008S8PPPG|5.0|Love the album. If you love Sade and Lauryn Hill, you'll love Jessie Ware. She is a little bit of both and more. Very sensual and sexy. LOOOOVVEEE HEERR
B003JTHXOK|4.0|What can I say... once in a while I buy a Nicholas Sparks book because I know exactly what I'm going to get and it never disappoints. For me, reading Sparks is like having a big bowl of ice cream or fresh made cookies. It's definitely not the best for you but it is oooohhh soooo delicious. Safe Haven went in a little deeper in areas of mental illness, substance abuse and domestic violence than you would normally expect from a book in this genre. Sparks did it in a way that was more uplifting rather than depressing. I love the magical touches he inserts in his stories and the beautiful settings offset the ugliness of some of the story line. I did not give it 5 stars mainly because I wanted more romance between the main characters. I am not talking about bedroom scenes, I wanted to have their relationship developed more and the love grow deeper. By en large, another win for Mr. Sparks.
B004QX07G4|3.0|This book was fine for a light read, but I didn't laugh out loud and some of her musings were a little strange.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|The movie depicted an empty nest couple that has lost the love that marriage brings to a relationship.  They were in a rut that life brings from the repetitive tasks of daily living.<br /><br />A trip to Maine and a therapist makes both of them to think about why love left their marriage.
B000FC130E|2.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman book, and may be my last.  While there were a lot of creative & unique aspects to this story, I found it disappointing.<br />I can't classify the genre it would fall into, either. It's a little bit fantasy, but nothing like classic fantasy books I could compare it to.
B002AOWXO0|5.0|I first heard Scarlett singing during the closing credits of the documentary Chasing Ice. I was blown away by the sexy raspy quality of her voice, and immediately came to Amazon to explore recordings.  Her voice and artistic expression is very much to my liking and enjoyment, and these duets with Peter Yorn appeal to me so much I have listened to this CD over and over.  I am hoping to find more of Scarlett singing!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|All the Ice Age movies have been above and beyond and this didn't disappoint me. Awesome as always and I would recommend it to all.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|Not my favorite movie but my sweetie just adores the extended version.  He was delighted with the DVD and has already watched it multiple times.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book! Easy read. Keeps ones interest throughout the book. Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I love the new music! It reminds me of their 70's music which I really loved. I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|i loved every minute of this movie and i really cant wait for the next one, i was so involved in this movie i honestly felt as if it was too short and left more questions than it answered
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!!  It was so addicting and I couldn't get enough! Very well written and can't wait to read the next one!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this story! I was amazed at the story line. I felt like it dealt with serious subject matter in a delicate way. It had many twist and turns and I couldn't put this book down! Highly recommend
B001EN71DG|5.0|I recommand it do anybody that is or will be a fan of the serie, the unaltered version is realy worth it!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|great price .... .....  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,, ,,,,  ,,,,  ,,,  :-)  better than nextflix because you own it and watch it over and over and over again
B001DJLD1M|4.0|This Matrix collection is for the true Neo follower.  I think the stories get too long winded and many scenes are sometimes stretch too far to keep your interest.
B003NX75B8|5.0|This John Green/David Levithan book is awesome. I usually do not read the normal teen lit, it's all fluff; she said this! He said that! However, this book is nothing like that. The characters are well developed, and you can see their faults, like any normal human being, as you get to know them. The story is heart felt and true, and despite the fact that normally I only read books once; this one, I keep coming back to.<br />Thank You, for this book it really stuck with me.
B003MAOTP2|5.0|Great epic style story - lots of action and great scenery and costumes.  Actors and main actress will keep you interested in the unraveling saga of greed and power struggles.
1449433251|5.0|I bought this for my 11-year old son who loves Calvin and Hobbes.  A good thing is that he loves it and laughs like crazy.  A bad thing is that he tries to imitate what Calvin says to his dad to me... Still, we have a great time reading this together.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Jason will have a cult following, I am sure.  All three films are as good as the books.  There is action, intrigue, more action, slight love interests, and good film direction.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I have just finished the book - great story - great characters and you were kept guessing till the very end.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I saw all the hype on this game but fail to see the attraction.  Deleted it soon after I played it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I have to admit, I'm not into romance type books.  A friend suggested this book.  My opinion may differ from people who enjoy reading love stories. The incest truly bothered me more than enjoying the love story revolving around the high school kids.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Don't try this one.  The tiles are too small to see properly.  I have trouble playing it. I will probably delete it from my tablet.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Both of there CD's are so great. I was lucky enough to see these guys in person and also meet them back stage. What a cool band, cant wait to see them again
B007RTAR64|4.0|Had to buy, just to keep on hand when I watch the moves or read the books.  Have read them more than 3 times already.  Will watch Hunger Games in preparation for Catching Fire.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|These guys are so tallented, I dont know where they come up with these songs but they are the best!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I LOVE FRUIT NINJA!!! I'M OBSESSED!!! It is SO AWESOME!!! I LOVE IT! I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME! I DEFINNATELY RECOMEND IT!!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|OK, I love this movie. I know some don't, and that's OK with me, but I do.<br /><br />From my perspective the extended version should have been released in the theaters, as it adds a great deal to the production. So if you you are a fan of Avatar and want an even fuller experience than the theatrical version, these are for you. The reproduction is very clear, and when played on an up-converting DVD player it is darn close to Bluray.<br /><br />The Amazon price was the best I found, and when I had a problem with the first set I received (The Disc 2 was faulty and wouldn't play), they sent me a new set even before I got the return label, AND they paid for the return shipping. Now that's great service!! So five stars from me for both the movie and for Amazon as well!! So I guess ten stars. * * * * * * * * * *
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really good game.  Very clear pictures. I even like the background music which doesn't happen often. It's never crashed  or frozen and I've played it loads.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is the most amazing cd I have heard by far a great artist and a very talented man .
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Bought the Kindle version- lots of fun. Sometimes the content is a little sparse, but very interesting, informative, and fun. Highly recommend even if you are not big on cooking.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|The detailed approach in gathering information for the book and the presentation was excellent. The view behind the popular press to reveal the atrocities of holocost proportions in the Congo and elsewhere is much needed. The extensive bibliography for follow-up was very helpful.  This reading is a must for the times that we live in.<br />Dr. Pennon Lockhart
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I had pre-ordered several copies of this Album.  Everyone I gave a copy to agrees with me that this is<br />Susan's best Album so far.  We all love it.
B000ICLRJ8|5.0|It's like wedding crashers, except, Owen Wilson is crashing Bosnia not weddings. Rule number 52: don't land in a communist country.
B003719GGS|5.0|I have often wondered what it is that punches my wife's buttons but so far that has remained elusive.  I thought there was no harm in reading this book to derive some insights that I could potentially harness. I think the philosophy articulated in this book is certainly rational and logical and it struck a chord with me.  I only wish that I had read it a number of years ago.  Perhaps I would have been a far better husband?<br />The five languages is a simple and easy book to read and one that has armed me with a strategy that I can try to help resolve differences between my partner and I.  While it is not a guarantee to keeping any relationship going, it at least provides a tool to help others help themselves.  The questionnaire in the back of the book will enable you to determine what your primary and secondary love language is.  In addition the book provides a number of FAQ, which help reinforce the books key messages.  I would recommend this book to others even if their marriage was not in trouble.  In this case I would classify this as a risk mitigation strategy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great period show.  All the English proper talk and all the servants competing to get better positions is hilarious.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Will not replace skilled hands with a whetstone, but this device is excellent.I've had this for a few months now. I even found old rusty knives in the basement and they sharpened up in just a minute or two.  I really like the sharpener for serrated blades.  I would definitely recommend this for backpacking, bug out bags or even the kitchen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I found the game fun, and relaxing. Having to use real money if you don't want to level at a snail's pace is annoying.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|i decided to watch th movies leading up to legacy so wehmn the bourne legacy came outy it would make more sense.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Loved it!!!!!<br />Such a feel good story with a great message to any woman! I highly suggest it to all!
B003U6BE8I|3.0|i wanted to see the movie becuase of the whole greek gods craze that there was back a year or two ago. the movie wasnt great but wasnt bad either.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An interesting take on world history.  The families seemed like real characters.  Everyone should begin at the beginning with this series.  I didn't but enoyed it anyway.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|i wanted to watch the movie for a while and decided to buy it so i could. it was worth the money but it could be worth more than even i paid. it was pretty good and easy to follow.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is far and beyond the best version of Angry Birds to date. A must for any Star Wars or Angry Birds fan.
B002436WFI|5.0|Super!  Includes material from The Light Fantastic, and does a wonderful job!  David Jason is particularly good as Rincewind; he's everybody's Rincewind!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|It could be worse, and for all I know may well be better than Stalone's effort (which I have not seen).  But where's the humor?  Judge Dredd was FUNNY!  Or at least, the old ones by his creator Wagner were.<br /><br />MegaCity One is all grimy and delapidated, rather than packed with color and imaginative futuristic details.  Which is a shame; for the world of the comics, however distopian, was certainly colorful.  But I could forgive that, on account of the budget, if only they had injected a bit of brightness and color into the script.<br /><br />It's nice that Dredd keeps his helmet on (one of the reasons I never bothered with Stalone).  Thus we never find out he is really Karl Urban, and not Judge Dredd.  But it's not enough.  Dredd, implacable as he was, had -- and needs to have -- a bright side - for otherwise he is not Wagner's larger-than-life embodiment of implacable justice (and occasional mercy); but merely another angry thug in a cop-suit sadistically taking out his frustrations on the criminal element.
0307744434|3.0|I was so excited to read this book, as all reviews and the blurb got me eager to escape into a new world, however I really didn't feel like the book lived up to expectations. There are only so many times one can read florid prose on the wonders of this 'night circus' before it begins to feel repetitive and superficial - even to a language/literary lover like me. I think it may have been partly due to the book being told omnisciently that I felt a lack of connection to the characters and felt that the descriptions were too passive (even self indulgent on the author's part) to hold my interest for the entirety of the book, because really that is what this novel is: a novel of beautiful description and prose which takes priority over plot and character development. I much prefer a novel where characterisations takes centre stage, and description acts as the driving force, however I felt that the characters and plot were merely second thoughts to the author's desire to convey a picture of the imaginary setting. This is all very well if you enjoy a fluffy, imaginary romp in someone's beautiful imagination, but I prefer a more multifaceted story I can sink my teeth into, and The Night Circus's lack of depth made it an ultimately dull read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Bought as a gift.  Love this series!  Might even buy more.  I am done with this review now - thank you.
B00AYB1RXE|4.0|This is an amazing story..Just think if by the American standard if Jimmy Hendrix or Elvis Presley were still alive we would have had the same reaction.  I really like this guys music, I actually bought the soundtrack.  The story is a true fairy tail, you won't believe it!
B005WQ4RP6|3.0|Had trouble with video stream.  The movie was fine.  I was doing a review for a college course so it was convenient to get it on my computer without having to go out to a video store...  but was irritated with the pauses in the streaming.  since we have fast connections I don't believe the issue was on this end.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I really thought this was so funny, Rebel Wilson is hilarious. I would recommend to anyone who likes Bridesmaids or Glee.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|JUST A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY...ONE OF THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS STORIES EVER TOLD. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANY CHRISTMAS CAROL FAN!!!
B001HN694K|5.0|I have always loved Alice in Wonderland and to have Tim Burton do it is the best! If you like the story and also like Tim Burton then you'll love this version of Alice in Wonderland!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I'm not a wordsmith or anybody that can interpret lyrics anywhere close to what others have done here so I just want to throw out a couple of improvisational comments about the music; the musicianship.  1st, like most of us here; huge Rush fan.  2nd, I've been a fan of instrumental music all my life.  3rd, Geddy and Neil (with occasional Alex) fire the music neurons in my brain like few others. Here are a few observations from CA:<br /><br />+ 1st Rush work in several years that I like right out of the box.<br />+ Geddy jams on this album in a way I have not heard since Signals- And this fact alone moves the album into the lead of recent releases.<br />- Alex got lazy.  Way too much delay and blistering solos lacking phrasing.  Where is that tasty and thoughtful work of Hemispheres, GUP, and so many others?  When I heard Caravan in concert I thought that was a filler solo that would get replaced with a real one on the record.  Sadly not.  However, The Garden solo is tasty and feels like a warm blanket.  Can't shred on that tune so he was forced to think it through.  I repeatedly wish I could listen to this with only bass and drums. Side note - With all the home studio gear out there now wouldn't it be nice to sell music with a separate track format option so you could make your own mixes?! I would pay a lot extra to get that capability.<br />- Too much background \\"noise\\".  The steam punk sound effects and multitrack layers might sound good on studio sound systems but to those of us listening on standard gear it just sounds a little overbearing and distracting.  All the layering was a complaint I had about the two previous albums.  Just too much going on; especially on guitars. I yearn for the clean three piece jams of yesterday (i.e. Counterparts).<br />+ Some of the catchiest choruses I have heard in a long long while.  You weren't listening if you don't catch \\"I can't stop thinking big\\" or my favorite chorus \\"seven cities of gold\\" swirling in your head at any given moment.<br />+ Totally agree with others that I had my 1st \\"album\\" experience since the early 80's.  It was really a treat to sit on the sofa and listen start to finish while following along in the booklet.  And the experience ambushed me.  I thought I would just sit down to listen to it on my big system.  Oh, what's in the booklet?  Zing - transported off to album land.  Nice.<br />+ Being an instrumental music fan I was disappointed with the fact that there were none.  However, when you familiarize yourself with the concept part of the album you realize that an instrumental piece just has no place here.<br /><br />Overall nice work.  If this ends up being the final album it's one that they and we can be proud of.  If they retire music's IQ will take a huge hit.
0399160450|3.0|Stopped reading it, for awhile, to give myself a break.  Will pick it up later.  Very detailed and unnecessary wordy.
B003M98792|4.0|Interesting to see where Quentin pulls some of his crazy stuff from.  This has to be the earliest example of &#34;blood geysers&#34; that I have seen.  There are probably earlier examples, but I'm not an aficionado on the samurai movies.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This movie is a little raunchy, but there is just no funnier movie out there. Plus its romantic and smart.
B00173EVDQ|5.0|MFSL makes the best vinyl on the market.  And it helps when you can get it in near mint condition, even though the ablum is vintage.  Many thanks for a great transaction.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. This is actually the second time I've read it. I bought it for my Kindle so I'd have it and I re-read it because I also purchased the second one in the series and wanted to read this one again before reading the next one.
B000FG0DKG|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said.  One of the best albums of all time by a group that will never perform in its entirety again.  The MFSL copy is awesome I'm sure, but is likely going to stay in its plastic sleeve for most of its life.  Thanks for a great transaction.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have to be honest. For a while there I HATED Gideon. He almost screwed everything up with Eva. In many ways he's more messed up than Christian Grey from the Fifty Shades series. I can't wait till the next one is released :)
B0026JQ9NK|5.0|In great condition.  I actually bought this at a record store to give as a gift, but after hearing had to have a copy for myself and was able to find it at a great price on Amazon.  Thanks!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|My husband's niece does homework and needs a dictionary so I gave hear this one and she loved it ,thanks.hbgbchn
075669812X|4.0|I basically bought this to add some variety. I have practically bought lego ninjago everything and my kids like them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game considering that it is on a tablet but I wish it had caves and armor and that iron isn't so rare but still very impressive for a game on a tablet
B002BWP49C|5.0|Of course......i luv this movie cannot wait for the Breaking Dawn 2 is out. My order was delivered great. l
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I connected on an unreal level with this book. Everything from the love Holder and Sky share to the every ounce of heartache. I cried countless times and was laughing out loud at Sky's embarrassing moments. Well done, Mrs. Hoover!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson wont give me back my Fire when he is here he loves the game. A must have for grandparents
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Beautifully drawn, but not much of story.  Worth watching for the art, and there's a little humor there, but not enough to make up for a disappointing plot.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|great movie with some surprising twists! after seeing this one i hope they continue to make more, certainly worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game provides enjoyment and realistic aspects as well as good quality. It will occasionally give a blank screen but you can easily get out of it by pressing the back button. I do wish it provided for opportunities for manually taking care of it (such as brushing and things like that) but it is fine as it is. I would recommend this game for horse/animal lovers or just to pass the time.
B003O86MY8|4.0|This was again for my husband, music is good.  Just not something I can listen to over and over like some music.  Just me.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Have used a couple of times at gym while running.  So far, so good.  Don't expect them to be long lasting.  The quality has really gone down over the years, shockingly so.  Speaking of \\"shocking\\", I noticed that I was getting small electrical shocks in my ears where the earphones touched while using a treadmill that seemed full of static electricity.  Didn't happen once I switched treadmills.  Yikes.  Oh well.  I still prefer even these cheap-o headphones to the earbud type.  Just wish someone would make a higher quality product, which I would be willing to pay more for.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Performances are amazing,l especially Christoph Waltz, and the story is riveting, hilarious and infinitely satisfying.  Tarantino is a true treasure.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Found this author while looking for ebooks at my library page. Decided to try this one since it was first of a series. Well written, nicely drawn characters and excellent plot as soon as I return this one I'll check out the next one in the series
B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-Men: First Class has become my favorite X-Men movie, and one of my favorite comic book movies in general.<br /><br />This is one of the rare comic book movies where the plot is great, the acting is exceptional, the character development is mature and interesting, and the visuals drag you into the movie (The Avengers is another rarity in this case as well).<br /><br />Definitely check it out, especially if you're a comic book fan.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved The Pact because of its author.  Her stories are always impossible to figure out quickly.  I couldn't stop reading until the end.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|If you like Tron: Legacy, and especially the original Tron: Legacy soundtrack, you should check out this CD as well.<br /><br />While it plays off of the original CD very well, I thought it was slightly less interesting and exciting. Still worth a listen, however!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is I fun game but you have to let it take hours to finish item unless you want to buy jewels.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|From the minute I started playing Plants vs. Zombies, I was hooked.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Amazingly fun gameplay. Killing zombies with plants sounds ridiculous, but it's a great concept that's worked very well for them.<br />* Great graphics. Not top-of-the-line, but great. More &#34;fun&#34; than anything else.<br />* Easy to get a handle on the game concept.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The game pace might ramp up a little too fast for the casual gamer, but if you stick with it, you should get the hang of it.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this app, for any price.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I love Hawaiian music, and the soundtrack caught my fancy when I saw the movie.  I play this CD nonstop.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Another great Disney classic available on Amazon Instant Video. The story and movie are well-done and family-friendly, and worth watching for any Disney fan. The quality of the movie streaming is good considering the age.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I am not a big fan of vampires books or movies, but this one was well done and the story line was interesting
B0055S348W|5.0|I LOVE this app.<br /><br />I use this printing app to print from my phone or table to my Google Cloud Print printers, which this app can pull from. Can also print from WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, and Windows or Mac shared printers (cf. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055S348W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_65).<br /><br />If you plan on ever printing from your phone or tablet, definitely check out this app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Title says it all.  I'm glad I can catch up to the current season, and glad I'm an Amazon Prime member so I can stream it for free.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|I remember when Space Jam came out, I was so excited. Michael Jordan was one of my sports heroes, and he didn't disappoint in this movie. Yes, it's wacky, yes, it's cheesy, but it's great. Anyone who remembers watching it in the '90's still speaks fondly of it to this day.<br /><br />Amazon did a good job streaming this video as well. It's not of the highest quality since it's a '90's movie, but they a great job with what they had.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome I really like it because it is like it is a real horse you are taking care of
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The Avengers is, without a doubt, the best comic superhero movie yet. While there are other, single-superhero movies that have done well (Batman series, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, X-Men, Amazing Spider-Man, etc.), this movie stands out for combining so many superheroes and doing it so well.<br /><br />Joss Whedon, known for his character development, does a great job not only weaving a bunch of individual stories together, but keeping it interesting at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone who's a fan of superhero movies, comic book movies, action movies, or well-done CGI should give this movie a watch. Or two. Or three. Or four...
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Evanescence is awesome!!! What more can I say? A A A A A A AA  A AA A A A A
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'd heard of this game, but hadn't given it a shot until this past year.<br /><br />This game is one of the more fun constantly-scrolling games I've ever played. Speed increases over time, power-ups are available for purchase and throughout the game, and the &#34;little things&#34; (like the scientists running around) make it a quality product.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this game takes a bit of time to increase your skill. It's fun, but tough!
B005R32L66|3.0|Well I have to say that the app is great on the tablet and computer. The phone is another deal. I hear background noise and the video is not that great. I wish that is was better for I would use it more.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|purchased this to read for our book club. I am a huge fan of NS but am not a big reader...I read this in a week or so and quickly read another of his books I had sitting on my shelf...<br /><br />This book is a whole lot different then he usually writes. Crazy, was so not expecting it...so good but not quite my fave.<br /><br />I can not wait to discuss it with the group on Sat!!
0670026603|5.0|As neurosurgeon I don't like to read books &#34;close to home&#34; but this book is a must read for everybody.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I haven't put my kindle down for nearly 2 hours, this is so much fun and the real time activities aren't outrageously long either, great graphics too!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Love the movie love the price! Thanks for a great product and customer service! Enjoyed watching this with my son and daughter.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Omg that was the best book I have ever read! I sat down today about halfway through the book and didn't put it down til I reached the end!! Praise to the writer!!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Of course I loved this book, wishing I had the next to get started on:(  I've read reviews saying Books 4 &5 are not as good as 123 but I disagree, yeah sure there is a not so interesting part here and there but if you are truly a fan of this series there is no way you could not like all of the books. GOT fan for Life!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It has saved my laptop from several threats and trojan horses, so I trust it.  I recommned it very highly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game of ever played since moviestarplanet I love this game.<br />I've had slot at fun playing with my friends and seeing their horses
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It really kept me interested.  I didn't want it to end, and when it did, I wish it went on.  I read &#34;The Guardian&#34; quite awhile ago, and was looking for another book to read.  I saw the movie Nights in Rodanthe; so I knew I couldn't go wrong choosing something by Nicholas Sparks.  Looking forward to reading more of his stories.
B001F12J48|1.0|We were all ready for a #D experience and discovered that the movie is not in 3D!!! We tried our own expensive 3D glasses and then the glasses that came with the product and the result was similar, the screen was still blurry and not viewable.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|It's so fluffy I am gonna die!  Really do I need to say more?  Well, for those of you who haven't seen this show, let me just say it is awesome for all ages.  Nothing like kids to make an evil mastermind have a change of heart.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|My son loves the game but it was very hard to get this to work on the Kindle.  I had to delete tons of stuff and unload and reload the app several times.  It seems to work now but it does get jerky/freezes at times.
B00304LF0W|3.0|My teenager loves this show.  I myself hate it.  I would have given it one star but I felt I had to consider her opinion as well.  It's not that the story is bad.  It is just so slow moving I hate to sit still for it.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I watched this one Saturday when I was home alone. This definitely isn't anything you want to watch with the kids around. It was ok for a rainy Saturday afternoon and there's nothing else on tv. There were funny moments but it wasn't consistently funny. It'll cure boredom for a while.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I have two children, 10 and 17.  We all absolutely love this movie.  There is a few parts that may not be for younger children, but even 20 years later you can't help but enjoy this quirky comedy!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought the movie was rather interesting and so did my 65 yr old father UNTIL the vampires came out. Great movie if you're into sci-fi plus pseudo history, but otherwise not for everyone. I was thoroughly entertained though.
B00899F0G8|5.0|It was great being able to catch up.  Just started watching recently, and was probably watching Season 2, when the first part of Season 3 was being aired.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Need this for my new iMac. $30 for an adapter is crazy. Lower the price and I'd give it 5 stars!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a sad book and sometimes it was happy. I even cried a few times. It is very sad.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I would rate this game 5 stars if i could ever play it. It wont even open anymore. One of the key selling features to the kindle is its ability to run games and have an appstore along with its beautiful book selection, but Amazon's appstore doesnt even begin to compare to googleplay. Amazon's app updates are also behind. I don't know if its Amazon or Gameloft, either way I am very disappointed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|For a free game it is ok, but the level get to hard to quick to really do anything with it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I suppose I should say I love it.  But, do I feel love?  Is the passion of my monster some sick love or just hate?
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so good your hooked as soon as you start playing. Great game for the little bit of money. Yea!
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|My husband and I started the Dukan Diet on New Years Eve, 3 weeks ago.  I'm down as of today 16 pounds and my husband is down 12 pounds.  We both have about 30 pounds to go but it really works!!  The craving really do go away after about 3-5 days.  Stick to it and you will be amazed. Thank you Dr. Dukan!
1419703692|3.0|When I received the book which was a gift, it was in a fairly large box with no cushioning to keep it from sliding back and forth. So by the time it reached me, the top corner of the binding was dented and the cover was permanently wrinkled.
B007SGM084|1.0|Being a fan of good erotic fiction, I so wanted to like this book.  Thank goodness it was purchased as a gift- I would have been very upset had I spent $30 dollars on a trilogy when I could barely get through the first half of the first book.  I almost stopped because I found myself not liking either of the main characters at all. I prefer my erotic fiction to be a little more realistic (I know, maybe I am the one having the fantasy), but these weren't characters- they were caricatures. We never do find out what the oh-so-mysterious Christian Grey did or does to become so wealthy at such a young, young age.  But you wouldn't know he was young from the dialogue. He talks like a 65 year old English lord. Let's not forget about the college student who apparently has never encountered such technological wonders as an email account or an iMac.  The sex scenes I read were almost anti-erotic.  I almost bailed when the female protagonist (who, of course, was a virgin) screamed, \\"Aaargh\\" during her first orgasm. Funny, nowhere did it say she was a pirate. Finally, after reading \\"Holy crap\\" and \\"Holy cow\\" coming out of Ana's mouth for the bazillionth time, I had to give up.  I'll wait until Megan Hart, Opal Carew, Lora Leigh, or Maya Banks/ Shayla Black come out with something new.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I not only liked the book, I loved it, it was a wonderful way to expand my horizon. The best cook book book not only were the recipes good but the history that was involved in this book .<br /><br />I would recommend this book to the people who like me love to cook .but not only to them but also to the ones who think that cooking is the hardest thing to do. so I would like to say this book is the best mix between cooking and history so please don't hesitate to read this amazing book.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|This is the worst peice of crap movie i've seen in the last 5 years. the martial arts is terrible and overexagerated, it's not even decent fight choregraphy it's terrible. Say what you want about<br />\\"The RZA\\"'s music the man simply cannot act. the story is all over the place and makes almost no sense. the character development is non existant the best reason most of the players do what they do is \\"just because\\" it's not even bad in a good way like a grindhouse picture it's just boring. the weapon design is kind of cool at times but other than that there is nothing good about this movie, NOTHING. i want that time of my life back.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is quality television. I can't wait to see how it all turns out in the last episode!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|if you are old enought to appriciate, ww2 movies, this is the one for you. enclosed in a tin, you will treasure it like no other.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game because its challenging but not impossible to solve. The graphics of rain drops and background designs are relaxing and add to the whole experience.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|i have series,1-2-3. so when i got the opertunity to pre-order #4 i did just that, am i glad i did. now i can't wate for what i beleive is the final season,#5. of course i'm watching it as it comes on television, every friday at 9 p.m. cst. wouldn't miss a date on friday!  i've always loved the knight, the round table , king arthur, and all the regalia! i'ts been around since i was a boy, i'm 81 now!! so much better than reading it in books! best part is getting them all from one place, amazon of course!! thank you amazon!
0399142533|5.0|I got this for a gift for my husband - I read it as well.  What a great author - I thoroughly enjoyed this book - right to the end it was full of surprise - never knowing 'who done it'!
B001LF347E|5.0|when i saw merlin, the first season, on amazon . com. i rushed to order it. within a few weeks they came out with episode 2&3. NATURALLY I ORDERED THOSE to my surprise weeks later i was told i could per-order the 4th. season. i had to wait a time for this because it had just been put on the market,in england. wait, wait, wait, finally the 4th. season arrived. now of course i watch the 5th. season on friday evenings, at 9p.m. CST  when this i beleive is the final season, i'll be first in line to have this season as well. proves to be a great season, and with what i've seen so far it is!
B00A6I87UQ|3.0|This is a review of the Kindle version of the Sky Atlas. I am using the Kindle Android program on a Xoom tablet. The download was easy and the file opened without problem. The format of the program is good, but the programming leaves something to be desired. The ebook is set up like a sequential page to page ebook. But this is a reference book; one might want to look at things on various pages. One must manually go page by page. I did not find a way to go from page 60 back to the list of constellations except page by page. It's been a LONG time since I had 20/20 vision so the scale of the drawings is rough (very tiny). The page charts are about 40 percent of the display screen (at a guesstimate). I tried to enlarge the diagrams by touching the screen and spreading my fingers apart, without success. This was possible in the introduction and list of constellations, however. The introductory material looks great in landscape view, but you'll want to turn your (Xoom) to portrait view or the tiny scale of the sky charts becomes impossibly small! I hope for an improved next version.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I  find this book somewhat confusing and not as exciting as her others. However,  I find Kay Scarpetta a very interesting and exciting person, then you add Benton, Lucy and Marino what more could you need.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The characterizations were excellent as was the writing. One felt &#34;in the story&#34;--especially if you are a parent. There was never a moment of not being totally gripped. This story has so many layers--I recommend it highly!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Its an okay movie but i probably won't watch more than once. Fast service though thanks very much. My husband liked it.
0812993357|3.0|It was breezy and chatty like a very long magazine article.  I didn't really expect more as I know she's not a writer, but it wasn't very insightful or illuminating.  I got bored about half way through but stayed with it.
6304711905|5.0|One of our favorite movies of all time. We have watched it so much we know all the lines. Fast service too.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Some of the language was tough to get through, this is not a fast read. But it's an exciting adventure nonetheless.
B005LAII08|5.0|I always buy movies for us to watch with the grandchildren. We all loved it and Grampa and I will watch it by ourselves.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|It belongs on vinyl, totally. It is better than expected and I listen to it whenever I get the chance.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Riveting plot, crosses, double crosses and triple crosses.  Difficult to put down, keeps you thinking. A winner. Harry b schrier, md
098555780X|5.0|I have 44 books in my library on Knot Tying. This is a welcome addition. For the first time in a long time, there is something new being added to the knot tying field, which has much repetition of past practices. JD has some new designs and his illustrations are in color and excellent. I made a complex keychain first try. I liked this book so much, I bought JD's other book. If your new to knot tying or you want to make keychains, bracelets,etc. this is an excellent book. I bought a copy for my grandson who's just getting started in knot tying. Thanks JD for a great book. I look forward to your next one. :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely wonderful series...It catches your attention and then it keeps you there.  Certainly worth the money and most important your time.  Enjoy!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Second World War England via present day Florida does not sound plausible or even interesting. Sprinkle bizarre vintage photos and a boy in search of adventure and you've got a nice stew of intrigue, fantasy and possibly nazi hunters. Can't wait to re-read it again. My teenage kids liked it as well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is the man!  I've read almost all he has written and wait for the new one<br />with anticipation.  His books hold you hostage to the point you don't want to put them<br />down as you want to know what happens next.  Always a great read.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like this game a lot.  The app worked great for the first few days. Now I can't get into the tournament game and it freezes now and I loss all my credits and winnings.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|I consider myself a well-rounded bad religion fan: my favorite album is \\"no control\\" but I love even their their newer sound (sorry but I wasn't a big fan of their Atlantic years...) this album is a hybrid of how awesome greg and Brett's songwriting has gotten with the energy of suffer/against the grain.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|Great music.  I was given this cassette years ago when i was recovering from  a very serious car accident. I know the music helped with the healing process.  Uplifting.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I admit that I was not drawn to reading this. I did not like the title or the premise. I'm not a big fan of thrillers in general. And I hate paying almost the same price for an e-version as the hard-cover cost. But I kept getting told by friends whose reading taste I respect that I must read it and so a few days ago I broke down and downloaded it to my iPad. And I could not put it down.<br /><br />If it is nothing it is highly addictive reading. The plot is disturbing...at least to me...and becomes more disturbing right up to its very disturbing end.<br />The author brilliantly weaves an intricate story full of so many twists and turns, you stop trying to figure it out what will happen next. I at once liked and hated both Amy and Nick, right up to the last page. That aside, the author is a wonderful writer with a sharp and clever and yes...page-turning style. Definitely recommended reading.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|One of the dumbest movies I've seen in recent years.  The gore factor was ridiculous.  It was surprising with a pretty decent cast, but the movie itself was idiotic and brutal.
B009NXV51S|5.0|A good movie, espically for fans of Classic Rock. One of the best movies ever made. Great story and great acting overall.
B007STBUIW|5.0|It's Jaws on Bluray. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Picture quality was excellent for an older film and you get an interesting behind the scenes &#34;Making of Jaws&#34; bonus.
B003YV0A02|5.0|One of the best action movies of all time. Great at Christmas or anytime. A true classic, better than the sequels.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This CD arrived on time, was brand new, and I had no problems with it at all. No damage or anything
B003FM1MNO|4.0|Not as good as Fellowship, but the trio movies really flows as one. Great movie and great acting all around.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Need a basic notepad for your Droid? Then try this. You can set up different colours for work, personal, etc.
B00271SFB6|5.0|After the silly over the top movies of the late 90s and early 00s, Bond finally goes back to the roots and becomes a dark, gritty action movie again! Craig is perfect for a modern day 007.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Buy this album, seriously. Stop what you're doing, buy, and listen to one of the best albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />I bought this album about a month ago and have been listnening nonstop ever since, which is rare for me. This album has multiples genre of music woven together seamlessly, and accompanied by some of the most beautiful poetry you've ever listned to. Every song is good. I've especially started to like Interlude 1, the vocals-only track.<br /><br />These guys are seriously talented, and I can't wait for more!<br /><br />Like all good fruit, the balance of life is in the ripe and ruine!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|LOVE this series, finally I can watch it on my 42'' hdtv. looks great. Although I like parts 2 and 3 better than the 1st.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|When got past viewing issues the film was wonderful.  Men would consider a chic flick but very meaningful could visualize this happening.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I was so glad when this came out. Looks friggin' amaaaaaaazing on my 42'' tv. Love the story as well!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is not your ordinary boy meets girl, lots of unexpected twists in the story line!  A must read romance.
B007G51UV0|1.0|Had this board send two day shipping. Got here the next day.<br />Mounted board and put in my RAM, 15 gig 1600. There is a little MEM light that came one solid red and the board would not post.<br />Verified the RAM was 1.5volt and compatible.<br />Pressed the \\"MEM PK\\" button. This lets the board check the mem and adjust it it.  No post.<br />Tried one stick - No post<br />Tried another stick of 1333 MEM - No post<br />Tired another stick of 1866 MEM - No post<br />Contacted Asus online via chat.  Took 56 minutes.<br />Person was kind but said that the board was DOA.<br />returning the board, I realize now I have to also replace the CPU silicone grease, frustrating.<br />Then I noticed that even though the original Board got here over night, the replacement board will not be here until next Monday the 28th. The grease I have to buy more of will get here faster than the replacement board.<br />In the mean time, no computer for me...<br />Just frustrated with all the work and having to wait another week. If I had picked up the board a store locally I could just run it back.  Lesson learned.<br />I will update my board experience once I get a working one.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Another fine book full of fun and excitement!! Found out I was missing this one from my collection so I had to have it.
B00866H7SS|3.0|This book was ok. It's story line is very similar to fifty shades.<br />However this is a must read because the second book reflected in you was fantastic.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|My oldest daughter loves lions, my husband and even our baby had fun with the songs. I love digital movie options so I don't have to worry about physical copies cluttering up my house.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great read. I loved it.<br />It has it all romance , mystery and drama. A great story line.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Loved it--food for thought! I have more thoughts than words<br /> I guess I won't respond any more<br /> Thanks any way
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Counting the days down for book 3.<br />Bared to you was a good read, however reflected in you was fantastic, I loved it
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome! I am glad there is diamonds! The multiplayer is cool, too! You can play multiplayer with WiFi and 2 devices in the same network. It is awesome!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't believe that this was so easy to purchase and watch.  I love the story line and the ease of using Amazon.com<br /><br />I didn't even know it was available, and felt extremely confident that this wasn't going to be some type of web program to attack my computer!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for having what I needed for my &#34;fix&#34;.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very fun and very addicting it's even better when you get limited dragons; they earn can quickly get this app!!!!!!
B000009ED0|1.0|When I finally received this order, cd was damaged beyond repair. This cd had so many scratches on it that it was not fixable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. Just simple as that. Suzanne Collins is by far one of the most significant authors ever. Worth reading this series!!!!
B0058DRUV6|3.0|The extensive research that backs up this book dwarfs the simplicity of it's findings. It's disappointing knowing that most of the companies featured in this book are now stripped of their &#34;good to great&#34; titles. Nonetheless, this one's a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very realistic. It looks like a real horse. The training is really easy too. Bottom line this is a great game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What a compelling story teller! Great connection with current events and very plausible scenario. I can't wait til the next book comes out!
B007SGM084|3.0|It is to graphic for me but the story line was fine.  I read to much to pay what the three books cost so I consider it over priced.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Please give this CD a try. Its so different and fresh. It will have you smiling and stomping your feet for more....Love their style
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So far its better than the first season. And the british seem to always have better dialog than the American writers...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent story line.  The characters were very well developed.  Hated for the story to end!  I would highly recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I started this book as an audiobook, then halfway through I stopped and left it for about three months. I recently picked it back up to actually read the rest. I just finished it and am pleased to say that the second half is better than the first half.<br /><br />\\"My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My hold is District 12. I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The Capitol hates me. Peeta was taken prisoner. He is thought to be dead. Most likely he is dead. It is probably best if he is dead...\\" (4)<br /><br />This book changes things dramatically from the first book, and where the second book left us. A lot of things happened that I didn't expect, nor wanted to happen (after a while you get a little picture in your head of what you want to happen to/ with the characters) but I suppose that is what made the book more surprising. I feel, however that the taking down of the capitol happened way too fast, as it only last about a paragraph or so (especially in comparison with how long it took them to plan the war.) I also found the ending to be a bit anticlimactic as Katniss settles in with her new way of life, but it does finalize everything.<br /><br />\\"Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire.\\" (352)<br /><br />In all, I feel this book is great at tying everything up, but it was no way near as great as The Hunger Games or Catching Fire. I hope to read a lot more from Suzanne Collins, because she is wonderful in portraying her writing through to the imagination of her readers.<br /><br />First Line: \\"I star down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather.\\" (3)<br />Last Line: \\"But there are much worse games to play.\\" (389)<br />-----------------------<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />\\"Some walks you have to take alone.\\" (5)<br /><br />\\"So after, when he whispers, 'You love me. Real or not real?' I tell him, 'Real.'\\" (388)
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I can't even begin to explain this book after finishing it just now. I'm trying to gather my thoughts on how Immensely I feel about all of this. 1007 pages, this book is worth the MEMORY itself not to mention the expected 9 other dawnshards of the Stormlight Archive delivered by the Radiants themselves. Go with the Spren my friends.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun, addictive, relaxing, tricky, makes you think, but not in a stressful way. Bright colors make it a &quot;feel good&quot; lets do this kind of game.
1451695195|3.0|I really enjoyed reading Dr. Alexander's book. I also met him in person and he is very present and always at the ready to answer questions. His presence makes one feel that they are comfrotable and have known him for a long time.<br /><br />I read the book in one day. I could not put it down. As much as I feel the back story of his life and illness were needed, I do wish he had spoke more of the \\"other side.\\" I am greatful though that he did tell his story. I just feel that it was more of a brian teaser. The book left me with some questions, but I did attend a workshop of his and he is always prepared to answer what he can.<br /><br />It is an enjoyable book, but not the most detailed. He did provide new knowledge however and had a different NDE than other people have which makes his book unique in that perspective.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Hard to put down. Looking forward to the next one.  Good story telling. Kept me thinking when not reading the story.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|for Disney to be involved in anything where the female doesn't need a male hero. Priceless! Pixar, thank you! 5 Stars!
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|probably my fault but being a user of elements, I trusted the adobe name to be a friendly program...all i want to do is edit pictures, not distort them and as of now this app doesn't do that.  I want a program to add and subtract light, brighten colors and crop easily....photoshop for kindle seems more a project and composition app...Maybe this app does what it is supposed to do but it doesn't do What I want it to...simple editing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game definitely keeps my attention and I like the many different options to choose from. Really glad I stumbled upon this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent opportunity to drift away for a while into the historical aristocracy of the landed gentry of England. Always interesting and even dramatic at times!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Game is very enjoyable to play.  It does take some time getting use to but after you play for a bit you get the idea.  The only thing I do not like is having to pay close to five dollars per app to complete the adventures.  I personally feel that is quite costly.  If it wasn't for the costly upgrade I would have given it a better score.
B008P76UKE|3.0|For Wagner newbies, its probably better to get a set of the abridged operas, Bohm and Karajan have two disk releases, far more interesting and true to Wagner than this invented and too-long tone poem.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|watched 1st 10 min. couldn't handle any more. if I would have known it a comedy musical i never would rented it
B009JBZH54|5.0|Batman<br /><br />Great trilogy, everyone should own this.  I already saw this movies a lot of times and i'm not tired of it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love the show, love having the dvd to watch at my discretion... Eight more words to finish this review... boo!
B0012FHGCW|1.0|This was an incredibly bad movie with a counterproductive message. It is an exercise in navel-gazing with a selfish destructive main character. Do not waste your time with this one. If you need a summary of the plot, it is the story of an individual with promise and potential who decides to throw his life away because he is so busy searching for \\"meaning\\" that he is unable to find the existing meaning around him. In the end it did not matter because the search costs him his life. I am just upset that I cannot get back the portion of my life wasted on watching this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is realy fun there is nothing wrong with it what so ever and should stay free oh yeah.cant wait for a second won
B0030B621W|4.0|I enjoyed this movie -- not because it made me giggle, but because it made me feel something.  There are some plot holes big enough to drive a lunar harvester through, but they don't distract from the over-arching theme.  Pretty well done.  Kevin Spacey did a bang-up job voicing the 'bot; his smooth voice translates well into monotones.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this in one day.  Loved it. The author allowed us into sky's mind heart and soul.  A great read.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|By far, this is one of the most amazing albums of Kylie Minogue, is unique, this woman is a real singer and this album can probe that. Every track have his own soul, and the lyrics have a new meaning. Perfect!
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|This was by far the worst movie in the series. It's boring and has an ending that would be barely excusable in a ballywood film. Don't waste your money on this movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you like hidden mystery games I think this is a good one that keeps giving you enough quests to keep you interested.
B003VANOFY|2.0|This is a great pair of headphones with great sound and great comfort. However the quality is ruined with sound cutting out and crackling every 15 minutes or so due to interference along the 2.8 ghz band.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Vogt bathtub  yvtvtbtvtvtvt.  Ft.  T  t  f.  Dr  f2f f f f f.  F f f f f f d. Safe Ghost
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A wonderful classic read. I highly recommend it. Still a few scanning inaccuracies but better than the last version I downloaded.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I like this type of game. The only thing I dislike is that there aren't more games like this for the kindle fire.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Ice Age: Continental Drift is an excellent movie for all ages. It is well made and very funny.Buy you'll love it, we did...
B002XED5TY|4.0|we rented this for my 7 yr old son who LOVED it.  It wasnt as good as Batman and Robin with George Clooney but he still loved it.  of course the batmobile was a huge hit, along with all the gadgets.  was a good movie to watch for a family of super hero nuts.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy an excellent movie for an excellent price.<br />Buy it and see for youself.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|IT puts  Abraham Lincon in a rediculeus positions, but the that was their intention, to make a LAGHING STOKE OF ONE OF OUR FINDING FATHERES, OR TO BE MORE PRECISE, THE ONE WHO FREED THE SLAVSES.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best virtual horse game in the world it's free so anyone can get it . you should. try it
B005R32L66|2.0|I downloaded this app and it kept processing.  I never got to video chat with anyone. Not to mention how much space the program takes up on my phone.
B004LL1HMY|5.0|An already great album song-wise I decided to purchase on Vinyl. The price isn't bad and the record is beautifully packaged, along with a free MP3 download code. Was nice addition to my new collection.
B003LPR4ZK|5.0|Beautifully acted; beautiful story. Could NOT ask for more. One of the top 5 movies I have ever seen...one of the top 5 books I have ever read
B006LSZECO|5.0|Despite all the reviews about the ending, Gillian Flynn really pulled this off. Can't wait to read her other novels.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|This was a very fun movie to watch with a good amount of action and comedy, and no overwhelming romance.  The colorful and pronounced computer graphics make this a spectacular visual experience that I wish I could have seen in 3D!
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|This review is not of the movie, it's of Amazon's movie rental \\"service\\".  I settled down for a nice evening of watching the film only to find the video I was streaming from Amazon stopped after 24 seconds. It kept stopping at the same place.  Amazon did call me right away when I left me phone number (that impressed me) and did cancel the order, but they told me that I had a slow internet connection which is far from true.  I have Comcast Xfinity and stream television programs all the time with not even any lag, ever. I can't imagine a faster connection.  The person who spoke to me was condescending and officious.  I will never \\"rent\\" another video from Amazon  EVER EVER EVER.  A shame, because it probably would have been a service I
B00992CF6W|4.0|I bought this for my grandson to use on my kindle and he loves it. Easy download and easy installation
B0068FYZ9S|3.0|Since its initial release in 2002, The Bourne Identity has been reviewed countless times, I am not here to review the film. As we all know, this is a very entertaining movie, one of the best in its genre. I am however going to review Universal's 100th Anniversary Edition release of the Bourne Identity [[ASIN:B0068FYZ9S The Bourne Identity [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)]].<br /><br />In the item description/product info it says that this is a 2 disc edition, however it only includes one disc. This is where my main complaint comes in. The disc is double sided, meaning that one side is in DVD format, while the opposite side is the Blu-Ray format. In my opinion, this is a totally dumb way of releasing movies as one of the sides is prone to scratches, affecting its longevity.<br /><br />On the positive side, it includes an insert with a code to download a digital copy. I want to commend Universal for re-releasing great films in Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy bundles at such a great price.<br /><br />P.S: Universal's 100th Anniversary Edition of The Bourne Supremacy [[ASIN:B0068FZ18C The Bourne Supremacy [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)]] & The Bourne Ultimatum [[ASIN:B0068FZ196 The Bourne Ultimatum [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)]]are also 1 double sided disc editions, despite what the product info/item description may say.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good to play when your bored. Its pretty fun i guess lol. It teaches you a little bit about horses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|\\"Please, Momma, can we download Subway Surfer?\\" That was all I heard foe two weeks. They have really enjoyed it. It is not just for boys. My daughter llikes it too.
B004J64QSI|4.0|Loved the opening view of the full orchestra... Nice full sound!<br /><br />Did they cast an opera singer as Valjean?  I prefer Colm with his grand, yet sensitive voice.<br /><br />Otherwise, loved all the performers in this version of the musical.  Surprised that a Jonas brother could pull-off the part of Marius so well, and that such a young Samantha Banks has such an impressive voice.  All others were worthy of this DVD purchase.<br /><br />Highly recommended performance as long as you can get past the operatic Valjean.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle reading even if it is on a XY Board for Android. I really like the Board and happy that the kindle has made apps available.... more please :)
B004HX4RT6|4.0|The game works well but has few bells and whistles. It let's you play chess so what more do you need...
B0076DELIG|3.0|I loved all the Bosch series by Connelly (I've read them all), he is a great author.... however, I was disappointed in this particular book.... seems like he has lost some of his umphf.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|I played this for a bit and then it quickly gets boring. Give it a try because it may be just the game for you.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|Not very easy to use... I canceled after just using it for an hour....I wasn't a smooth or easy as the one on my wife's IPAD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story! Thought I knew where the story was going then she threw a curve ball! Great read! Would read another novel from this author.
B0019GO58C|2.0|The viewers (if they can even care) are left to suppose why passing strangers allow themselves to follow through on an attraction to each other even though they have apparently loving marriages to very nice, supporting people.  Maybe it's the influence of society as portrayed by their best friends who are casually unfaithful to their own spouses.  Maybe they want a thrill.<br /><br />Streep and DeNiro are portrayed as having happy marriages until they start thinking about the stranger from the book store. Why?  And what is it they have seen in each other when they're in love?  There is no depth portrayed in their relationship, yet we're supposed to believe it's love?  They aren't teenagers who can be excused in seeing a monumental love in a returned admiring glance.  No sale here.<br /><br />I gave it two stars for the sake of the acting and filming, but took three stars away because there was nothing there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm big horse lover and I recommend this game to other animal lover's. easy to navigate and so far no problems.
B00886XQO0|4.0|There is no static noise compared to Delta's, and the Bluetooth works great on cell phones.<br /><br />The main reason I bought this was so that I could play Xbox with it, but it's actually pretty nice to take it outside and listen to music on your phone.<br /><br />Voice morphing is pretty fun to use by the way.<br /><br />The only con about this was that It is not compatible with PC, if I ever buy these kind of headset again, I'll make sure it is compatible with PC and my Game Consoles.
B005VTGB0S|2.0|I am not very happy with this product. Until today I was never really disappointed with any of the AmazonBasics products, but this one I will not recommend.<br />It does not fit very well and lots of controls are hard to reach.<br />Only good thing is that you get to choose different angles to fix your screen, but thats not of much use.<br />Many other cheaper options do much better job at protecting the iPad. Definitely read the reviews before finalizing on any one.
0811876373|5.0|This is a no-bake option for those wonderful little desserts. I made Reindeer and Snowmen, then I just started experimenting with Cake BonBons. The boxes looked like boxes of candy, however the surprise was the cake. This book will give you concise directions and within an hour, you will be creating cake pops. Use your imagination and surprise everyone with a peppermint kiss, or a cherry, or peanut butter cup center!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. As a trained sociologist, I admire the different perspectives and adherence to historical accuracy. And the story line is wonderfully addictive!
B0034G4P4O|4.0|This is a great family movie; however, I purchased it for a son-in- law who looks like Tin Tin, the best part was when I located a little &#34;Snowy&#34; on Amazon. The two items will make a great gift for children or adults.
B002AOWXQ8|3.0|I'm a music-lover that normally will fall in love with entire albums, but this one wasn't for me. I loved &#34;Home&#34; and expected the rest of the record to have infectious hooks, but I was actually pretty disappointed, which is rare for me. Still love the band, just not so happy about this album as a whole.
B003FM1MNO|1.0|Sound not on time with picture<br />Switched into SD every 30 seconds.<br />I Couldnt even watch it without restarting Amazon every minute.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|With all the sci-fi futuristic action/drama movies that come out I didn't expect this movie to be anything more or less than the others, but I got a lot more than I expected. The story line was enjoyable and fairly easy to follow for a movie that jumps around in time, and the futuristic difference somewhat believable. The lessons learned are good ones, but this definitely isn't one for the innocent little kids, there is some nudity, violence, and language. The relationship with his girl was not at all what the trailers I saw made it appear to be either, so don't be disappointed. I like the character, much like all of us, given a choice to do what is just for others or just right for ourselves. If you like to get caught up in multiple space timelines though stay away cause you won't like the way this movie portrays time travel since it allows infinite realities that still remain to exist with memory of the past practically no matter how the past changes only changing the future for the current timeline but no others in which case the ending for you will not matter since all timelines will still experience both the good and bad endings regardless of how it ends basically making all decisions, results, and the entire story-line practically pointless. On the other hand, if all that lingo just makes your head hurt, then you'll like this movie from beginning to end.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a pretty good book so good that I kept my neck in the same posture creating crick .
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I remember when I first watch this movie as a kid and wanted to go find treasure afterwards. I find myself quoting the movie all the time now as an adult and its an unforgettable movie. I wish more movies were like this one, movies now try to push the envelope for fun by adding questionable scenarios instead of the wholesome fun like the Goonies. I haven't found a person so far who has enjoyed this movie after I showed it to them.
034580404X|5.0|The first book is great.  A real page turner.  I can't buy one premise of this story.  **spoiler alert**  that the lead female is a virgin.  A virgin would run far, far away.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Enjoyed every album since her first this alum is truly is her at her best worth the $$ and then some s\def swizz bests blend On fire
0349001359|5.0|i am a huge fan and the book is awesome. it seem so real the development of the character i felt i was with him on so many  thoughts
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was not expecting the book to go in the direction it went. I love holder and sky together. What an unfortunate set of circumstances for the two of them.
031620157X|5.0|i would recommend it to anyone who likes twists on Grimm fairy tales. it was an addicting easy read. i loved it and have already recommended it to my friends.Love Chris Colfer ability to write.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have really enjoyed this. great graphics. entertaining.great way to relax. somewhat challenging but not too difficult. I'm very satisfied
1476719071|1.0|Come on, an 18 year old college freshman that plays professional poker in Los Vegas?  The bad guy with a heart that wins every fight in an extraordinary manner, setting a college on fire with no aftermath.  Great book for the college student that dreams the bad boy sexy guy is really going change in a month or two.<br /><br />There will probably be a movie made from it, but it is certainly not Jane Austin or Ana Karinena!  Love the cover art but I am sorry that is about where my interest waned.<br /><br />Fun light read on the beach, but that is it.  I had hope for more with such a great name and creative cover art.
B0007MUR2W|5.0|This is an excellent conceptual album about a divine extra terrestrial coming down to a doomed planet and offering the inhabitants rock and roll salvation.  They loved him so much and wanted more and more of him that everything went to his head and then he destroyed himself in the end.<br /><br />All of the songs are awesome.  The first two songs build you up and then there is Moonage Daydream (Ziggy Stardust revealed) I got lured in and put under the hypnotic spell of that song that I often want to hear it again and again. After that, you;re pretty floating along in orbit.<br /><br />The demo version of Ziggy Stardust is awesome because I feel like I'm alone in the room with David Bowie as he's playing and singing it; an intimate feeling.<br /><br />I would feel sorry for anyone who has gone their whole lives and not heard this.<br /><br />As in a lot of things, David Bowie's voice is hot and beautiful.  The whole band was wonderful.<br /><br />I only wish Mick Ronson were still with us.
B00A3OTNTC|4.0|Very up beat.  I bought it for just 1 song, but like several.  It's a great work out CD for the treadmill.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was a funny movie. The Thunder Buddies song was priceless! It is not appropriate for children at all. There are a ton of vulgar images, suggestions, scenarios, bad language, drug use, and drinking. Don't let the Teddy Bear fool you, lol!
B00899DR40|1.0|I am very disappointed in this album. I bought it for 2 sounds, thinking it would be a little more grown up than it is.  It's still to bubble gum.  Great for tweens.
B003O86FMW|4.0|You'd buy the third one. The author make you just get into and you can't stop reading. It is an awesome trilogy
B008011XQQ|4.0|This CD was recommended to me by a friend.  It is classic Santana.  You'll listen to it over and over again!
B001BR7CU2|5.0|i watched this when it first came out, i still watch it today, i now have it on all my stuff...
B00APUYN0I|4.0|The movie recounts a simple story which is supposed to be based on actual events.<br />It is a good movie well acted and easy on the viewer
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was pretty fun and makes u wanna get a horse . I had a great time playing my horse the game yeeeeuh
B00AE2J93I|3.0|Take &#34;the Sixth Sense&#34; and every New England/Salem Witch Trial story you've ever heard, whirl in a blender until smooth, and you've got this film. Decent story, fun visuals, lots of physical humor--and zombies!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not since \\"Presumed Innocent\\" or at least \\"Primal Fear\\" has there been a legal thriller that grips you by the throat and won't let go. Landay balances taut courtroom proceedings with an increasingly tense domestic drama, that calls into question what a parent believes their child could be capable of, and how much they're responsible for their child's actions. Warner Bros has optioned the book to make in to a feature. Should be a great film.
B009SQQRH2|2.0|We found this film heavy on what we felt was (for lack of a better expression), an excess of English (as in UK/GBR) sentiment and cultural norms and memes. This made it difficult for my 7 year old to enjoy...and made it a challenge for the adult audience as well.  Some nice twists on the usual &#34;Santa is real and uses technology&#34; and &#34;every child deserves christmas presents,&#34; themes. My daughter rated a &#34;Meh, daddy. Just...meh.&#34;
0380715430|5.0|This is a real eye opener, and it's fun--full disclosure, I'm an English prof. I love this book. It's like a conversation with a good smart friend.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|If you like epic gunplay and destruction, this is your film. Much better than you might think. Now I have to add three more words.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|For all those who enjoy nail-biting suspense and serious intrigue, this new series is for you. It will be obvious to you stright from the jump this series is produced by a well-oiled, highly capable production machine. The writing is top shelf, incorporating dialog that is believable but never repetitive. The basic premise and plot is also believable, as the possibility of something like this actually occurring, though highly unlikely, certainly falls within the purvue of just probabilities.<br />I enjoyed this show's entire first season at one fell swoop. I purchased the opening episode through the Amazon Instant Viewing offered by my Roku Box, but when I decided this series was very much worth a closer look, I rented the entire season, which is three disks (the upper limit on my Netflix rental plan), thus saving a thirty dollar instant rental fee.<br />The actors used in this innovative series are all well-known established personalities working at the top of their craft. You will recognize the lead from Band of Brothers of course, and who today isn't aware of Claire Danes? Every secondary and third and fourth-tier supportive cast members have been properly vetted for their roles, another production coup for the producers.<br />This is a series well worth an investment of your time. Set aside a Sunday afternoon, when your wife has taken the kids to soccer and you have the house to yourself. Grab a couple of brewskis and a bowl of whatever, sink comfortably into the Barko, pat the dog who is sitting next to you, and prepare to be transported by the magic of American television.<br />HIGHEST STARS! You don't want to miss this!
B00425S1H8|5.0|This product works flawlessly for updating the Laser Interceptor system.  You do have to install the driver for windows and I would recommend getting the latest version on the manufacturer's web site.<br /><br />Also of note:<br />I was running Windows 7 using VMware Fusion on my Mac.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|The video quality was so poor I couldn't stand to watch it. Way out of focus. The film wasn't compelling enough for me to want to get  past the poor quality, so I can't really review the film in a fair way.
B002APU580|5.0|Great music, great acting, great story, great movie.  This will definitely be on the list as one of my all-time favorite movies!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I live outside the U.S. part of the year so had only recently heard of Downton Abbey when a friend told me she was hooked on it. I was so happy I could watch Seasons 1 & 2 with Amazon Prime and get caught up quickly and be ready for Season 3 to begin.  Now that I'm leaving the U.S. again, I'm praying I can connect to my sling box so I can keep up with this wonderful series. Like everyone else, I'm hooked.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Book one was wonderful - though I read it not knowing it was a series. Book 2 was my least favorite...but maybe because I was not looking forward to paying for each.... and since it was mostly building the story for the big action to follow. But good thing I had this omnibus edition for the rest, as they were awesome to the \\"can't put it down\\" level, which I haven't enjoyed for a while!<br />Thank you, Mr. Howey, for the thought provoking escape - and thanks to my son for recommending this series.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I highly recommend this weather app.  One of the best I've seen and I've tried a lot of weather apps out there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it!!!!!! There are so many fun things you can do this a five star game!!!&lt;3 Love this game!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I hate when they say it is free. The download is free, but it cost money. You have to by tokens to further advancement. It looks like it could be a fun little game, but that is where they get you...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun. My sister had it on her ipod and I really wanted it but it hadn't come out yet
0199267170|4.0|It has in depth summaries and notes, but it lacks footnotes. The writing is very clear and is close to the original spellings
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I made a commitment to try to read books other than self help in 2013 my first choice knowing nothing about the most famous authors of romance I was so surprised could not put this book down. Great book and great stories even for non novel readers.
0307891372|5.0|Great guide anything you ever need for the game is here. Couldn't have covered the game more perfectly. Would deff recommend to buy :)
B0030MM68O|2.0|was all the fuss?  this was just ok.  no more than that.  just ok and not worth all of the hype.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|If you've read the unabridged Les Miserables, you know that the book was very very thick (actually several books put together) and there is relatively little story. Victor Hugo saw great injustices in the French system and wanted to educate the public about it in hope of changing the system. Essentially, it's an in depth, lengthy political commentary with just enough of a story to hook people.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is about humanity and exploitation as well as the fight against being exploited. It loosely strings together stories over centuries and I think that it was very well done. I watched the film first and thought that was the most ambitious film I could remember seeing. It differs somewhat from the book, but as David Mitchell himself said, a movie shouldn't be an audio book with pictures. This is a film and a book that made me want to talk about it in depth with others who had also experienced it...and yet I don't want to give it away by saying too much. I recommend reading it and watching it for yourself.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I hadn't chosen to read a Grisham book for ten or so years and thought I'd give his new one a try.  I found that it was just average.  I didn't root for the main character.  It wasn't incredibly suspenseful or anything.  I felt like there really weren't any real tense or climactic moments.  The climax was just kind of ho hum.  It wasn't a bad book at all.  It was just okay: one to pass the time and one that I wouldn't recommend to my friends.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am trying to be patient as I wait for the 3rd book to be released. I love this story, and the ending absolutely has me ready for more! Steamy!!!!
B00A6SZRGS|5.0|This cd. is amazing! I baught it after their concert at the paladium ballroom in dallas tx 01-10-13... i highly recomend this to all black veil brides fans.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was very happy that these books captivated me the way they did from the very first few pages! I love the characters and how well written the story lines were. I am looking forward to the 3rd book!!! I can hardly wait!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am enjoying playing MLP with my son! Kindle has some bugs that keep me from friending properly. Hope they get the issues solved!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great Game. I really enjoyed playing. Worth the price of admission<br /><br />. I've played dozens of these hidden object game and this game is definitely in the top 5
1451638450|5.0|First and foremost, I really, really enjoyed the book and pretty much read it in a couple of sittings over Christmas break.<br />Bujold not only is a good author, she is a smart author - rather than go to the well one more time with Miles Vorkosigan she instead writes her latest novel about a lesser character in the Vorkosigan universe: his \\"n'er-do-well\\" cousin Ivan. \\"N'er-do-well\\" is a relative term -- anyone in comparison to the hyper overachieving Miles might suffer in comparison. Still, Ivan meets and rescues a \\"princess\\" and her guardian fleeing from enemy forces who have overthrown the family's \\"kingdom\\" on -- wait for it -- Jackson's Whole. (Shades of Kurosawa's \\"The Hidden Fortress\\"...) It gets better: there is a Cetagandan tie-in. The novel is a great romp, and to avoid spoilers, I'll stop here. However, Bujold introduces enough new characters and enemies to provide material for two or three new novels in the Vorkosigan saga while keeping things fresh. And as always with her novels, the novel is focused on people rather than theneat technology they use, which is why she has a pile of writing awards.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is Reilly fun but after me and my brother started playing it together we would be in the middle of something and it would just say disconnected and every thing in my inventory would disappear.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|i have enjoyed the franchise but this has to be the end. they are obviously out of ideas and alice looks old
B000MRAAJM|3.0|This US version is 550 minutes, get the full 660 minutes version (Region Free), look it up on amazon uk . Not sure if they ship to US, worth checking though. You may be able to find it elsewhere too.
B00004T9UF|5.0|If your a fan of eminem this a a must have album. Great beats you can dance to. Explicit lyrics.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Definitely worth seeing. If you like sci-fi and Bruce Williss uncanny ability to be cast in time travel films, then you'll love it.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|can't watch my favorites so the app is kind of pointless. hope they add that feature soon so I can actually use the app
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love these guys. Their videos are fun to watch. (No pun intended).  Their lyrics are deep, their music draws one in.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I fell in love with Grisham all over gain with this book. Classic Grisham style and characters...with a nice twist that made me miss my train stop a few times it was so engrossing! Well done...can't wait I read the next one!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is what it is, a naughty daytime soap. Couldn't put it down, but was frustrated by redundant wording and the use of overly &#34;big&#34; words to explain simple things.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. People will be watching it for years. I've seen it about 7 times and I will watch it again.
B003UMW65W|4.0|This is an intertaining movie and has very cute music. I love the guest appearances and I would recommend this movie to anyone who has any kids.
0399160450|5.0|His books are always exciting and timely.  This author really does his research.  The things in this book are happening in the real world right now.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Perfect for one of the first BluRay DVDs I have purchased. Great quality, excellent picture and nice extras. It's always been one of my favorites... Thanks!
1416550534|5.0|This is her first book and I think it is the best one so far.  I really enjoyed it and hated for it to end.  It is slightly reminiscent of Downton Abby.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|A little tricky to download the driver and find what is needed to make it operational, but I did succeed. Having no optical drive, I had to drop and drag the contents from the mini CD they provided for the driver software. From the USB stick I then downloaded it to my ultrabook. After a semi-smooth install it worked and I now have Ethernet Internet when wi-fi isn't available. This is a nice addition for the traveler.
1451695195|2.0|I found this book very vague.  As a Christian, a lot of it didn't really make much sense.  It sounds like more of a drug induced fantasy to me.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins makes his case and does so intelligently and logically. Bottom line: You can be a moral, kind, responsible, loving, caring, law-abiding, and monogamous atheist. A zinger from Dawkins: scientists are happy to admit when they are proven wrong; it's how knowledge is increased. Believers of religion run from criticism of their blind faith.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Find the story intriguing and even though its futuristic the story really draws you in.  Good book for any reading level.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I've been a big Bad Religion fan for years and, while I've liked their recent efforts and they've certainly had their high points, I haven't felt that those albums been quite as good as their earlier work. True North, however, changes all of that. It is easily their best album album since Against The Grain. If you've been missing the classic BR sound of the early 90s, then you wont be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really brings it all together.  You are able to relate to the other books and the back grounds of the characters.  If you read the other 2, you will resolve everything in this book.

0765325950|1.0|Nothing can ruin a television episode, movie or book more than a lousy ending.  14 books, hundreds of thousands of deaths and what do we get?  A pointless return to the status quo that had been achieved by Lews Therrin.  The Dark Lord lives and the reasoning for Rand not destroying him when he was quite capable of doing so is ludicrous.  Of course, this means there can be an endless cycle of sequels, as events in the future permit the release of the Dark Lord again.  Personally, I was hoping for closure for the people of Jordan's fantasy world.  Closure does not exist in real life, but fantasy is not suppose to be like real life (and yes that is a swipe at a statement that Jordan once made about loose ends).  In the fantasy world much of what happens does not exist in real life(in good fantasy that is)there is magic, the supernatural and the good guy always triumphs (and never dies).  In real life there is no magic, or supernatural, and right does not always triumph. One reads fantasy to escape.  I watch the news on T.V., or read the newspaper (or Scientific American) when I want reality.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore's masterful score blends scenes and adds power to the Hobbit's action and drama. I love the songs, I love the orchestral numbers and the choral selections. THere's an excellent picture addition inside and a collectors app that leads to more material.  Very very nice.

B008602KQI|5.0|it takes some flack for being a rip-off of the Japanese film &#34;Battle Royale&#34; but I think both films are great for what they present. Hunger games pulls your tear strings a bit more than Battle Royale. I believe this is the beginning of a genre ( kill off contest) and now we have two films now with the same premise. there is no doubt though that Battle Royale was first.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love the challenge and the setup.  But it should have more challenges.  Most of them are too easy. All in all a good game.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is hilarious. The characters are a little two dimensional, and the laugh track is a little grating, but most episodes still bring me to tears of laughter.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book has a really good story and a realistic emotional interplay between the characters. It doesn't try to explain in depth all the science that is part of the story,it just has a nice flow to it.
0307200477|1.0|This book fell apart and the squeaker broke in the first week of having it!!  DO NOT BUY!  We only read it to out 4 month old - so adults were handling it alone and the binding is thoughtless.  I can't imagine if a child were to want to/try to read it.  The publisher need to rethink its product.  If I could return it I would.  JUNK!!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|It's a great story but personally I found the language on the book a bit complicated which made it hard to follow sometimes.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It is overly rated.  I download this on 1-13-13 and have had numerous problems like, deducting bingo cards ie if I mark for 1 card it substracts two or three cards from my inventory.  If I win coins or keys in the chests it deducts those from my inventory instead of adding to the inventory.  If I win coins on the bingo card it never adds up the correct amount to go into my inventory.  I spent about $150.00 buying additional coins before I figured out how I have been cheated.  As soon as I use up the coins I have I will not buy anymore.  Numerous reports to the Buffalo support teams answer has been &#34;we are aware of these problems and are trying to fix them!!!!!!

B008NA3I30|1.0|Spoiler alert! This review will reveal the end of \\"Take This Waltz.\\"<br /><br />\\"Take This Waltz\\" tells the story of Margot, a chronically depressed woman who is in a nice, stable marriage to Lou, a nice, stable guy. Margot meets, by chance, Daniel, a man who is slimmer, poorer, more artistic, and more conventionally handsome than her nice, stable husband. Don promises Margot hot experiences in bed. Margot leaves Lou for Dan.<br /><br />In a montage sequence, Margot is shown having hot encounters with Dan, including three ways. Then Margot is shown being, again, chronically depressed. Margot implies that she regrets leaving Lou.<br /><br />And that's it. That's the whole movie. It's not funny; it's not smart; it's not wonderful to look at. The direction, sets, costumes, dialogue, are all very not-special. The one powerful thing in the film is Michelle Williams' performance as Margot. Williams is a one woman storm front. Williams flutters and pouts and tears up and mopes with great gusto. Her performance totally overpowers anything else in the film, and it just starts feeling odd that someone is acting so hard in response to such a flimsy script in a film that isn't going anywhere.<br /><br />Lou and Margot aren't believable as a stable, settled couple. Michelle Williams is too young and too attractive. You think - he married her for her looks; she married him because she was looking for a rock. Their marriage is awkward. They aren't shown supporting or enjoying each other. They are shown not connecting and letting each other down. You don't get the sense that Margot is sacrificing one good thing - intimacy and security - for another good thing - dangerous but thrilling encounters with the unknown. You get the sense that someone without much life experience or depth wrote this script very quickly and without input or rewrites.<br /><br />The film throws in attempts to be artistic. Margot meets Dan at an open air museum where historical re-enactors whip a man accused of adultery. Margot is lectured by naked older women in a public shower: even new things get old. Lou is a cookbook author who writes only about chicken. The joke is, of course, that even exotic meats like snake are said to \\"taste like chicken.\\" Exotic Dan will eventually bore Margot just as domestic Lou did. These attempts to be artistic just make the film desperate and pretentious, not deep.<br /><br />The problem with the film is the problem with Margot. She is depressed; that is the central fact of her life. A dramatically arresting film about Margot would address her depression. She'd do what depressed people do - go to a shrink, try various medications, contemplate suicide, talk it out with friends. The film tries to be about the entropy of nice, stable relationships versus the appeal of the hot Bohemian stranger who promises an erotic candy shop of delights. That very interesting dilemma is not honored by the film. You don't look at Margot and think, \\"Appreciate what you have,\\" or even, \\"Go for it!\\" You look at Margot and think \\"Prozac. Please. Or talk therapy or something. Or else this film is going to kill me with boredom.\\"of adultery. Margot is lectured by naked older women in a public shower: even new things get old.

B0055Q5F36|1.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my husband. He can be rough on phones so he wanted a durable case. A friend told us about the otterbox however it did not fit the phone!
B008XCM18Q|5.0|A real page turner . It grabs you from the very first page and builds up to a crescendo. The reader gets  the reader into the mind of the protagonist , and the excitement and mystery of what transpires takes your breath away. Bravo, bravo  to the very talented author who spins a tale of intrigue and mystery that keeps the reader spellbound.,  I give this book all 5 stars without any reservation or hesitation.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was a terrific movie. I had high expectations for this movie prior to seeing it and I must say, it delivered.<br />It's about a group of British retirees--with depleted resources---who decide to take up residence at a new establishment in Japiur, India.<br />Once they arrive, they quickly learn that the hotel falls short of their expectations--but eventually grows on them.<br />In the process, they each learn a few valuable lessons proving that you're never too old to learn anything!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|LOVE IT  I think you did great on writing this book  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the previous two, I couldn't put the book down! I'm sad that I'm done reading them. They were incredible and captivating, a series I would highly recommend to anyone!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|We watched this movie right after watching the first one. If you liked all of the older Stallone movies you will like this one. The movie features other action heros from the past as well. There is some light humor thrown in (references to past action hero lines). The movie is not going to win any awards or anything but all in all it is fun to watch....we really enjoyed it.
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|Quality album, one of T.I's best body of work from beginning to end. This was a much needed album right now
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Don't let the title fool you this is a good movie. Romance and drama. Both men and women will like this movie.

B00APUQT7I|5.0|Excellent movie for adults and kids. I have watched all of the Ice Age movies and they are all great. I love it that they add new characters to each movie. Very cute movie.
B009IF7SWG|5.0|This film was just as funny the second time around. It been a few years since I have seen it, but well worth it
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|What a good movie. Action packed and a really neat idea for a movie. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt make a good team. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has come a long way from his hit show 3rd Rock From The Sun. I watch a LOT of movies and I really enjoyed the twists and turns of this movie.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|where is the new update wit gutsi and truffles? I have it for the I phone and gutsi and truffles r there. UPDATE PLEASE!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|A bit slow at times.  It is addicting and relaxing to play.  A cute physics Sim with both floating and gravity effects.
B000069HJN|5.0|I didn't know much about the 80's supertramp until recently.<br />I decided to look into these albums by reading online reviews and listening<br />to select tracks on youtube I was rather impressed. Then came the cd purchase<br />of BWYB. This is a great record with a superb title epic track. I love the strong jazz<br />vibe the album has but it also strikes a good ballance between jazzrock and progrock<br />this record gets 5 stars and it really earned it.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|While I am a non-fiction junky, I have found this an incredible look inside the office of the Presidency and the relationships betweens the men who served.  I have gained some more respect for a couple I didn't like while in office and some disdain for a couple I did.  I couldn't put this book down.  My only regret is it didn't explore the Presidents before Harry Truman.
B004YKB50Q|3.0|The fragile is viewed as a yes essential by most prog fans.<br />I would say that it fits nicely with the  other 70's yes records<br />but I dont necessarily see it as the best of that decade of the<br />years. What we have here is 5or 6 songs woven together by little<br />intro's, excerps, instumentals extc.Not to say that they aren't good<br />and add to the album but i was expecting a little more based on the<br />reviews that I heard. All in all its maybe a step above the previous<br />record so i give 3 stars.
0439023513|3.0|I had no plans to read the books or see the movies until DISH gave us a free weekend with HG in the lineup. Watched it and it intrigued me enough to want to read the book. So in a rare move, I paid full price for the books, and read them all in five days. I should have stopped at the first book. The second book was okay, but once it was read, reading the third book was a must. So, should have stopped at HG. After I read Mockingjay, I started reading the reviews to see why people liked it so much, because I did not. It seems that of those that don't like it, the fans like to uniformly criticize them for not understanding that this was a war, that war is ugly, deaths are senseless, and that they shouldn't have expected a fairytale ending. I've noticed that some rabid fans have even cut and pasted the same rebuttal to several reviews, strange. My main criticism of the book is that the story did not evoke any emotion from me. Some have said that Katniss had PTSD and therefore her emotions were suppressed. Since the book is written in first person, Katniss' lack of emotional response makes the book read like a list. First this horrible thing happened, then I was mad, then I was crying, then I was hiding, then I ate, then that scary thing happened, then this person died, then we were running... I think the author's goal to write a book with a message interfered with her writing a good story. About the ending, I would have liked it to have been more developed. The emphasis on Katniss' PTSD meant that since she didn't care about anything, we didn't find out about what happened to many of the characters. Disappointed, what a waste of my time and money.
B00000E5MC|3.0|This is my first magnum cd. after listening to it i can see what the buzz was all about.<br />This is really a strong AOR record. However i do feel that some of the songs could've<br />been longer to allow the groups progressive talent to shine through. Dont wake the lion<br />is an okay epic but not anything truly special or would make this record more valuable.<br />The album is what it is a more than decent rock album.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|This sweeping tale is the stuff of great film making. Eastwoods masterful direction and a cast of some of the most prolifc actors we know have created a film that virtually ignites the screen. Any doubt of Sean Penns' ability to recreate himself for a role, to transform every eye movement, every speech syntax into someone new is proven yet again in Mystic River and his fearless performance is riviting.<br /><br />The story both dark and heart wrenching pushes it's way beyond predictable and happy hollywood endings. It owns itself and stands in the light of both impeccable story telling and brilliance. A modern day classic.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|Super band from Tucson, very popular here in Flagstaff. Great blend of guitars, percussion, bass, brass, vibraphone, and keys. Really recommend seeing them live if you can.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I have to agree with some of the comments about being able to organize your photos and all. BUT, this app is just what I needed. I recently tried to upload all of my pictures on my cell phone (~800) to my computer and found out my droid phone was incompatible with the program verizon uses. My droid incredible 2 is only 2 years old. I was pretty frustrated and could not figure out any way to move my pictures off of my phone in a convienent way. This app let me do that. It was very quick and I was more excited than I thought to be able to view those pics on my Kindle fire.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|LDR's voice is mesmerizing and I've played the album straight for over a week.  Nearly every song is truly hypnotic and I would strongly recommend this album
B00846REIS|5.0|This book had me hooked on the first chapter. Love this book can not wait to read the second one.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|As a close follwup to the very successful Born To Die album, this album I think is even better.  I hardly ever write reviews, but this album is worth the price and you will be highly impressed.
B008SVS0K0|3.0|I was excited to hear the new album after all the reviews saying how amazing it was.  Billy Talent is my favorite band, and have been since the first day I heard &#34;Try Honesty&#34;.  The truth is they have never bested their first album, actually they havnt come close.  The worst part is that the best songs on this album very closely resemble remakes of some of their past songs (so much so that after hearing them, I began singing the lyrics to older songs that the melodies matched).  After listening to this CD a few times through, I had the urge to put in Billy Talent I -  All the comments mention how mature the bands sound has become, and how much they have evolved, yet to me, any of these songs could have appeared on their first album and would have fit in and sounded just the same.  Also, lyric content seems very similar.  When I think of a band evolving and maturing, I think of my second favorite band Brand New, who have certainly matured from album to album.
1439156816|5.0|I really have enjoyed this book.  It is a great combination of his personal experiences and practical information on how to be a better writer.
0765325950|4.0|As a long-time fan of the series I have to start off with a big thank you to Mr. Sanderson.  If it weren't for him we would be stuck forever wondering how this story would end.  The story is well-written and extremely fast-paced despite being very long.  The only thing that is missing is closure for so many of the characters I have spent more than a decade getting to know.  It's almost like the story moving so fast caught up Mr. Sanderson and rushed him along to the conclusion.  I want to know what happened to more than a small handful of characters!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love the graphics on this game I also like the multiplier is really awesome,I can't wait to show all my friends!!!!!!!!!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. This is a good purchase. I can never get enough of this movie.
0345803485|3.0|I would also like to comment on the author's choice of the hero's name. Distinctively, \\"Christian\\" is a name reminiscent of our Savior's Name, so it is difficult to connect it with grey color and its 50 shades, as E.L. James does in her novel \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".<br /><br />In my romance novella titled \\"The Life of a Love\\", already available at Amazon's Kindle Store, I have also used the name \\"Christian\\" for my male protagonist's ID, but solely for the above mentioned reason.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is my absolute favorite equine-related app, the game gives you the ability to own, take care of, and show your very own horse. The graphics are very clear and I have yet to have a glitches with the app.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I've been wanting this for a while for my Kindle. I'm so glad I got the free version before making a purchase. I tried playing the game by first using my fingers, and it just couldn't keep up...the response time was off. When I tried using the controller arrows at the bottom, it just felt awkward to me, so I deleted the game altogether.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is a great series, but I did not like the ending.  The further it went the more dissatisfying it got.  I understand a dark ending to a dystopian society, but unlike the preceding two books, this didn't feel real or make me want to relate to the characters.

B007RKPO84|3.0|At first i really enjoyed this album but that enjoyment quickly declined. Its not that this is a bad album but a average when comparing it to Kreator's previous works. It definitely has its moments and their are a few songs I still enjoy but looking at it overall it doesn't quite hold up to Kreator's works in the past. Now Kreator is one of my favorite album all time and I hold the album Extreme Aggressions as my favorite album of all time. Switching from not only that album but their more modern albums to Phantom Antichrist tends to make me just wish i was listening to their older stuff. I have noticed a decrease in production as they seem to just blast you with noise(sounds seem to blend in) some parts and then it suddenly drops to a quite part. This would be fine if they used a bit more dynamic range when mixing and mastering but its just not their. Some songs i just really cant get into because of just how over played Kreator makes it. Its like they want me to feel perhaps mournful or inspired some parts when they just don't pull it off. I will say that when they want me to feel aggressive they get the job done. Although I see clear problems with this album I still enjoy it from time to time but not too often or else it falls short.<br /><br />I will admit that thrash metal has declined overall in regards to my interests in music. So your personal interests in thrash metal could very well make you feel that this is a better album. I just don't understand why people are giving this 5/5 and a 10/10 i mean if you genuinely feel that way then by all means do so. But i feel people are listening to this album without keeping the older material in mind. To make fans of this album feel like I haven't lost faith in Kreator i will say that this is my favorite thrash album of 2012.<br /><br />P.S.~ Buy Extreme Aggressions over this! It will change your views on music forever!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book. It is so incredibly sweet and funny, yet heart breaking at times. The main characters optimism and belief in his ability to change himself into the person he wants to be is beautiful. The morals of the story are to work towards bettering one's self, and showing kindness and appreciation to those around you. I highly recommend it.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Beautiful, eye catching,and down right funny, this is the movie that started all the other types like it, Mat and Heath give 2 memorable performances and I think Heath,s best movie , not for small children
B00846REIS|4.0|Good follow up to 50 Shades series. Almost a copycat but second part gets very good. Looking forward to third book
B001EAWMGA|5.0|have seen the following movies pertaining to vikings , Pathfinder, Beowolf and The Vikings and I must say this movie is as real as they were, the premise is a little out there but the movie is so freaking beautiful the Morwen is really eye catching and makes you wonder where the  Dragons and Vikings combined, If you love fantasy with a thinking twist or new unique creatures then this is for you, LOVE this movie,
B005Q2505M|4.0|It is very understandable but i found a lot of unrequired explanations and that makes you want to skip the page.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|great at the beginning but you'll have to spend actual money as you progress throughout the game. Stuck right now because I have to buy gems for Rarity to continue the missions. highly disappointed.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Many choices of sounds, each with its owm volume setting. It is very easy and not intimidating at all. On my Kindle Fire HD I use rain, campfire, and thunder. What a lovely way to fall asleep or play solitaire!
