B000089RVX|5.0|I am what some may say a hardcore fan of Evanescence, but I am for a good reason. This band goes beyond the slutty, pointless blubber that many bands today have become known for. Plus, their music, considered Goth/Metal by some, actually has good lyrics and music, not the complete screeching and screaming someone would expect. Here's a quick overview of the songs: <br /> <br />Going Under- 4/5: A good song, a decent way to start out the album. Mainly the song is about being held down by someone and struggling to break free. The vocals are good and the tune keeps you interested. <br /> <br />Bring Me to Life- 4.5/5: One of the most famous of Evanescence's songs, Bring Me to Life takes Amy's chilling voice and Ben Moody's decent one and combinds them to get a great song. <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool- 5/5: A very angry song that talks about posers and people pretending to be who they're not. The Music adds a lot of feeling to the lyrics, allowing the listener to picture what is being said. <br /> <br />My Immortal- 4/5: This is a good song, but it was WAY overplayed on the radio. (The radio version isn't as good anyway) Amy with her piano create a sad and deep melody really drawing in the listener. <br /> <br />Haunted- 4.5/5: Very chilling and just as the title says, haunting. The lyrics merely add to the spookyness of the song along with the music that only adds to the feeling. <br /> <br />Tourniquet- 4.5/5: Another chilling song, which I figure is about suicide and redemption takes Hard Rock music and Amy's voice to create a great song, with somewhat strange and a little creepy lyrics. <br /> <br />Imaginary- 5/5: My favorite song on this CD, likes with the strings end of Tourniquet and takes the listener from a dark, chilling area, to a more hopeful, almost happy tune. The lyrics are wonderful as is the music. I was shocked to never hear this song on the radio. <br /> <br />Taking Over Me- 3.5/5: They seemed to come up a bit weak on this one. I don't know why this song doesn't draw me in. The music is good, as are the lyrics, but there's just something about the song that doesn't catch me as the others have. <br /> <br />Hello- 5/5: This is the \\"My Immortal\\" of the CD. Once again we have taken Amy's voice and the piano to create a very deep song. This one seems to focus on silence and peace, a nice reprieve from the other louder, agressive songs. <br /> <br />My Last Breath- 4/5: This song reminds me of \\"Taking Over Me\\", with somewhat different lyrics. The tunes both have similarities, but I like this one's lyrics more I guess. <br /> <br />Whisper- 4.5/5: Quite an end to the album this song is. Very loud and agressive, along with the interesting chanting in the background makes a great end to the CD and makes the listeners want to beg for more. <br /> <br />I would give this band a 4.5 stars, but I'll gice them the 5 for overall presentation. I am very pleased with this album and cannot wait for the sequel. I highly recommed this to anyone looking for some great music that can look past the veil and see how great this band really is.
0140544518|5.0|To think that all this time we've gotten it wrong! According to this tale in the very words of Alfred T Wolf, he has suffered for years under the misnomer \\"Big, Bad\\", when the truth is that the whole brouhaha is the result of a borrowed cup of sugar and a few random sneezes. (Sounds like the allergy alibi to me.)<br /><br />Apparently, Mr. Wolf is only guilty of trying to borrow a cup of sugar in good faith, caught in exigent circumstances beyond his control. That the first neighbor's house (Pig #1) was made of straw only occasioned a fit of sneezing, leading to the pigs demise, followed by an equally unfortunate visit to Pig #2, with similar results. And still no cup of sugar! By the time Wolf approaches Pig #3, the allergy excuse has worn thin and a fit of temper lands A.T. Wolf behind bars. Of course, the press makes a mountain out of a molehill, blowing the whole story out of proportion. Hence, the slanderous name of Big, Bad Wolf!<br /><br />This imaginative perspective on a familiar fairy tale is a delight to read, if a bit self-aggrandizing, the inimitable illustrations of Lane Smith making the case for one very misguided lupine, willing to go to any lengths for a little free press. Luan Gaines/2005.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|When I first heard of Nightwish, it was from a friend who said they reminded her of one of my favorite bands Evanescence. So, following her recommendation, I picked up this CD. I am SO glad I did! Nightwish takes classical, opera, and metal, mixes them and comes out with a great album. Here's a quick overview of the songs: <br /> <br />Dark Chest of Wonders- 4.5/5: Wow. That is the word for this song. A great opening and very inspiring lyrics makes this song one of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />I Wish I Had an Angel- 4/5: Somewhat different from the usual songs on the album, this song has a very catchy tune and good lyrics, the overall sound seems to set it apart from the rest of the songs on the CD though. <br /> <br />Nemo- 5/5: This was the first Nightwish song I heard and I still love it! The lyrics and melody work wonderfully together to make a beautiful song. <br /> <br />Planet Hell- 4.5/5: An interesting song, the lyrics astound me. They link together so well making this great song and with the music, it just adds to the pleasure of listening. <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood- 3.5/5: This song, although it has an interesting theme and tells about the Native Americans, didn't capture me like some of the other songs seemed to. The Indian language at the end was a nice touch though. <br /> <br />The Siren- 5/5: One of my favorite songs on this CD. There aren't many lyrics but the music does way more than make up for that! I love the feeling this song gives and I love listening to it. <br /> <br />Dead Gardens- 4/5: A good song with good lyrics, but the end doesn't sound natural. It kind of just cuts off rather abruptly and confused me at first. Still a good song though. <br /> <br />Romanticide- 4.5/5: Reminds me of the song prior to it, but the ending is better. The lyrics once again are pretty and the music really packs a punch. <br /> <br />Ghost Love Score- 4/5: A very nice ballad, sung well and the music is great, only it was a bit long for my taste and kind of drags on. It a good song, but I guess I prefer more fast-paced ones. <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan- 3.5/5: This song was probably my least favorite, although it is a good song, it never managed to capture my attension. The lyrics in Finnish are interesting, but once agin the song didn't manage to capture me. <br /> <br />Higher Than Hope- 5/5: Possibly my favorite song on the CD, the opening with the acoustic guitar was nice and the lyrics chilled me. The music fits so well and everything together just screams as a masterpiece. <br /> <br />*Bonus Tracks: <br />White Night Fantasy- 4/5: For a bonus track this song isn't that bad. The lyrics and tune are decent and add up to a good song. <br /> <br />Live to Tell the Tale- 4/5: The better one of the 2 bonus tracks, this song is a really nice addition to the other songs on the CD. <br /> <br />Overall, I give this CD 4.5 stars for both music and lyrics. I think I'm hooked on this band now and I recommend this to any Evanescence fans or someone looking for a great CD.
B00079FUI6|3.0|I'm not going to talk about the show. I'm assuming if youre reading this you already know how good it is and what its about. The question is will this DVD be worth it. <br /> <br />My answer is unfortunately, no. Where I see Lost and Alias strong as DVD box sets, I think Desparate Housewives lacks the intruige that would keep you coming back to watch the DVD over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I love the show, and it is worthy to have its own seasons of DVDs, its just I don't think its worth it to have this series on your shelf. I'd recommend to rent it, I definately will.  <br /> <br />I give the TV show itself 5 stars, but the value of the DVD 3. I hope you understand what I mean, if that made sense. Thanks for your time. <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This is going to be quite a short review.  Why you may ask?  Well this film is based a lot on the mysteries surrounding it.  If i say too much, the mysteries are already solved.  So im going to attempt to say as little aobut this movie as possible.  Anything that i think might be damaging to your enjoyment of the movie is marked with the regular ###s<br /><br />This film messes with your mind.  A few times i had to think a bit \\"Okay is this in the present?  The past?\\"  It switches times and places on you without much warning.  However even with the sometimes rushed feeling of the film, it still wasnt quick enough.  The more you learn the more you want to learn.  There came a point when i was highly impatient and couldnt stand the thought that the movie had as much time left as it did.  Everything that went on was interesting to me and compeled me to continue watching just to see how things turned out.  Sometimes i have a tendency to pause the movie to get up and get something to eat or drink or whatever.  But that didnt happen once this movie started!  I HAD to know what was happening so there was no way i was pausing anything!  The last twenty minutes or so (possibly half an hour?) are VERY intense.  I found myself wringing my hands more than once.<br /><br />The gore factor is there, but not overstressed.  In fact reading the trivia on Internet Movie Database it says they took out some of the more gross scenes to get their rating down to an 'R' from a 'NC17'.  It also says that they used some of the reharsal takes for the movie.  Must be why Cary Elwes sometimes annoys me.<br /><br />###The mystery is actually quite simple.  But its SO simple that it ends up being quite complex.  You overthink yourself and what might be going on.  And ive probably already said more than i should.###<br /><br />Bottom line, DONT let anyone ruin this for you!  If you havent seen it, go out and get it NOW!
B000069KGM|5.0|Remember when Chicago was a rock band with a horn section?  It was 1969 and the then-christened Chicago Transit Authority released their debut album--and a double-LP at that! Both sides of the original first disc (tracks 1-6) have become classics in the Chicago canon: \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is,\\" \\"Beginnings\\" and \\"Questions 67 And 68.\\" The second disc kicked off with Terry Kath's six-minute-plus guitar freakout, followed by the heavy \\"Southern California Purples.\\" \\"I'm a Man\\" is a seven-minute piece of blue-eyed soul complete with an extended drum solo. The album closes with a 14-minute semi-jam \\"Liberation.\\"  Chicago would have bigger hits after this, but they never consistently rocked as hard. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00004W50T|5.0|\\"Music From Big Pink\\" is one of the handful of records that changed everything. The record is amazing by itself, but becomes even more awesome when seen as a two-record effort in tandem with the group's second effort,  \\"The Band.\\"    Normally I don't place reviews on Amazon regarding widely-recognized masterpieces of this sort, because I feel the better-known giants are already well documented.  I want to write about this album because I want to stress the influence that it had over other people's music.    Among others, this record was supposedly the immediate progenitor of efforts as diverse as: \\"Layla and other Assorted Love Songs,\\" \\"The Beatles\\" (a.k.a. \\"The White Album\\"), \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"John Wesley Hardin,\\" \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" \\"Eat A Peach,\\" and frankly most of the late 1960s/early 1970 music scene. This record was huge. It really changed what we listened to; and it's influences still can be heard.    A simple way to judge how important \\"Music From Big Pink\\" was is to simply examine the huge impact that the album's centerpiece, \\"The Weight\\" had. It's on cellular telephone commercials still, and it has been recorded by artists as diverse as: LeAnn Rimes, John Denver, Van Morrison, Matt Nathanson, Aretha Franklin, Duane Allman, Smith, The Staple Singers, George Martin, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Jackie DeShannon, (and many others).    This album never sold the way it should have (yeah, it's sold in the millions, though it should have outsold \\"Thriller\\" or \\"Saturday Night Fever\\"), but it has cast a shadow that we still see in the music industry.
B00009ATIX|2.0|The basic premise has been seen before: a small isolated group of people is visited by apparitions from their past. In this case, a psychologist from Earth is assigned to a space station orbiting a strange planet (sun?) called Solaris, to sort out what has been driving the crew to suicide and murder. By the time he gets there, only two crew-members remain alive - and he starts getting visits from an alien impersonating his dead wife.  It doesn't take him long to form an emotional attachment to her, even though he knows on an intellectual level that it can't really be her.  She acknowledges that she's formed out of his memories of her - so, even if he remembers some things wrong, that's how she'll appear - and this could have been interesting to explore.  But we never learn much more than that - what these aliens really are, whether their intention is malevolent or benign, what they really want - and in fact, we never learn much of *anything* in this movie.  It's all scenery (and not very interesting scenery, at that), long meaningless pauses, unpleasant background music; it drags endlessly toward absolutely no resolution.  By the end (finally!), you're not even sure what really happened.  I suppose that was the point, but it's neither insightful nor satisfying.  Had this story been condensed into half an hour, it might have been a nice \\"mood piece\\" - but movie-length, it was just soporific.  The only reason I give it two stars instead of one, is due to the pure visual appeal of George Clooney and Natascha McElhone.  But this is not a vehicle worthy of Clooney's talents, nor is it enjoyable science fiction.
B000002GBK|2.0|As a long time Rick Wakeman fan it always puzzled me why King Arthur was missing from my collection, now I know why. Compared to the 'Journey' album this is a disappointment, the vocals are muddy and there is no story being told, just a collection of Wakeman tracks with an orchestral backing. I will probably hold on to the CD for a while just in case it grows on me but don't be surprised if this album ends up in a second hand store.
B000003TA4|5.0|I can't believe there is actually people giving this album 1 star,its pathetic,the fact that this album was released 14 years ago and there is STILL people coming on-line to review it is testement to how great this album was and still is.Nevermind & nirvana defined and set the stanard for every punk,metal,nu-metal & *grunge* band we listen to today,without them I doubt alot of the bands today would even be around. <br />to say they were made up by the record company to exploit a growing trend just goes to show how little some people know about the band.Its totally unacceptable to say this album is rubbish,because put simply,its a lie.who cares how many albums nevermind sold? <br />Even today I still carry at least one nirvana album in my car,they were just that good!Bands like nirvana only come around once every few decades & since they finished no-ones even come close to the level of hysteria they caused back in 1991 with the release of nevermind. <br />If your not a fan dont listen,but dont come on just to give out about them,thats just pathetic.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Much like the previous Radiohead albums, this one will need to grow on you.  Once it does you can't get enough.  From start to finish they keep you interested with Pink Floydish tunes, and that typical Thom Yorke flare.  You won't be disappointed with Hail to the Thief.
B00006ADFL|2.0|The first thirty minutes of this movie are by far its strongest: we see the oppressive and provincial girls' Catholic school being turned upside down by the arrival of a worldly and precocious outsider, Kate Winslet in her trademark finest spunky form.<br /><br />After that the next 30 minutes are spent elaborating on how much Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey develop an intense codependency on each other, as a natural result of Winslet's traumatic childhood and emotionally distant parents, and Lynskey's deep insecurities as a result of her looks and class.  Kind of your typical pretty-girl-ugly-girl combination, to put it bluntly.  They pretty much create an incredibly vivid and powerful fantasy world that they inhabit together, and which will propel them towards the murder and mayhem of the last 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />I bailed out with about 25 minutes left to go because by that time it was painfully obvious what was going to happen, and if there's one thing I really cannot stand, it's a painfully predictable and obvious movie especially one involving a long downhill slide that you can see coming a thousand miles away...King Lear type stuff.  However I was already starting to get restless about 45 minutes into the movie...I stayed longer mainly to finish the very good bottle of wine I'd opened, LOL!<br /><br />You can sort of see Peter Jackson's talent in all the fantasy scenes which he brings to another level in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also Kate Winslet's onscreen charisma (this was her film debut apparently) which continues to make her one of my favorite actresses.  The cast is pretty much flawless, the film is well shot---but all those factors simply cannot save a fairly dull and commonplace plot that really would be better suited for some Made-For-TV movie, not a real feature film.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is such an amazing CD.  It will take a while to grow on you, but it really is one of their best.  Throw it in the CD player and leave it there for two or three weeks.  Guaranteed to get you into more Radiohead.  Once the addiction starts it is tough to quit.
B0000256VK|5.0|The lush vocals of chantuese Bryan Ferry, gracefully winding through the landscape of Roxy Music is pure bliss.  I purchased this album in 1986, when a new friend told me he liked RM.  Randomly scanning the bin, I chose \\"Avalon\\" among the RM collection, and discovered an inimitable masterpiece. Check out [...] for more info re: Avalon and other \\"Roxy Music\\", including tour dates and possible new studio recording.
0440418569|2.0|For me a good book needs several ingredients such as originality, mystery, depth of characters, etc... and it must be unpredictable, however it must have an ending that hits you in the face or leaves you intrigued. <br /> <br />Overall, I read this book and it did keep my interest (easy read), but once again we have a fantasy writer putting forward the idea of children that do not know their destiny or what they must do, will fumble through a saga/quest and make all the right decisions and win the day.   <br /> <br />I like the dust concept, the knife and several other concepts, however multiple universes (done before) is getting old. <br /> <br />The death of the main support players and the way they died was boring.  Plus `love rules the day and saves the universe' what's with that? Plus the ending! Go off and educate the universe? Why not have Lyra pregnant with a baby that can travel through all the universes and this baby has no soul <br /> <br />A good hard hitting, surprise ending would have made this book.  I feel the fact that it did not happen, turned an easy read into a bit of a disappointment. <br />
0670033693|5.0|Far more than a mystery (although it is also a great, suspenseful mystery), The Cold Dish is a book about people:  their friendships, resentments, doubts, and loves; in sum, a book about the human condition as it unfolds in the gorgeous mountain country of Wyoming.  Fast-paced, yet lovingly developed, The Cold Dish introduces us to Sheriff Walt Longmire -- a widowed Vietnam vet living in an unfinished log cabin -- and his best friend, Henry Standing Bear -- a Cheyenne Indian deep in intellect, compassion, and great humor.  The hilarious repartee between these two men is reason enough to read the book.  Add to these two the foul-mouthed deputy sheriff, Victoria (Vic) Moretti, from Philadelphia, the aging but very much alive former sheriff Lucian, and a whole host of other loveable or not-so-loveable characters, and you end up with a potpourri of human beings who are presented with such depth that, by the end of the book, they feel like close friends you've known a long time. <br />   These characters all interact over the brutal sexual assault of an Indian girl and the subsequent lenient sentences received by the four white boys who attacked her.  When the boys start being killed, the whodunnit begins.  And though the ending is totally unpredictable, and painfully tragic, The Cold Dish is so much more than a whodunnit that you're grateful that Craig Johnson gives us additional pages to come to grips -- along with the Sheriff -- with all that has transpired.  Far more is at issue here than who is killing the four teenagers, and solving the crime does not solve the human tragedies involved. <br />   Storytelling at its very finest, the only consolation for all of us who feel compelled to re-read the book because we miss those characters so much, is the promise of a sequel.  Thanks, Craig, for having the dog find Walt.  It helped us too in getting over our own sadness at finishing the book.  Best book I've read in years and WAY better than ANYTHING on the bestsellerlist.
B00008NV4I|5.0|This has to be one of the best Star Trek films to date. Its right up there with 2 and 6 which is what I believe to best of the whole series. There are questions raised and never answeared but who cares really when this film was made to showcase some really good sci-fi action. After seeing this film in theaters I was blown away at the fast paced action packed plot line.<br />The film does have a silly sub plot with the other version of Data but who can not love the battle of wits between the two men in the dead of space. Finally Picard has a real equal like Kirk had in Khan from ST 2. Picard also let lose and showed that he isn't really the thinking old man that the TV series showed him to be. Also the scimitar is the coolest ship ever to come out of the ST universe which felt like an homage to ST 6.<br />This movie with great sci-fi fun in mind and it hits home hard. Pick this film up and lose yourself in the phaser blasting light show or starship battles to save all of mankind aswell as themselves. I just hope we haven't really seen the end of this crew just yet. I feel they have a couple of more films in them.
0743454529|1.0|Ever hear the urban legend about the guy who insures a box of expensive cigars, then smokes 'em and tries to claim the insurance money because the cigars were destroyed by fire?  Ms. Picault has the girls' father, a firefighter, tell his wife this story as if it were original.  Later Ms. Picoult has the judge in the story's case state that he knows - because a relative who's a dentist told him - that a tooth left in a glass of coke will rot. <br /> <br />What?

Good grief.
B00005JKGO|5.0|This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, a vast panorama of life in all its complexity:  the search for love, for career, for perfection, and the deterioration of all flesh.  It is very much a film of the experience of a middle-aged man:  he has reached his limits, and yet yearns from something more, always beyond his grasp somehow.  At the same time, it is about Italian society in the 1960s, a kind of affluent, celebrity-driven culture that resembles the US is many ways, yet has its own style.  Having lived in Italy, I particularly enjoyed Fellini's humor and savage wit, particularly about romantic illusions.<br /><br />Every ten years of so, I watch this film and marvel at its depth, at the new layers that I see.  The ending is truly shocking and unexpected, with incredible symbolism.  Many things left unsaid, unresolved, unexplained, creating tension in the viewer and the need to resolve it alone, afterwards.  Along with Bergman, this is a true genius of the cinema.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B00004T0US|4.0|The chief problem of Elvis' 70s album was 1) marketing and 2) publishing.  <br /> <br />RCA chose never to be selective of the material they released, opting instead to release everything they had in the can in a haphazard manner. Horrible songs, rough outtakes and jams, bad sound mixes--and all of it wrapped in lame packaging. This was compunded by the songs Elvis recorded. Because he was beholden (by Col Parker most likely) to recording only songs that he owned the publishing rights to--and many good songwriters refused to sell their rights to him--Elvis didn't get the quality material he deserved. Still, that's not to say Elvis couldn't have released some great album in the 70s had RCA shown more marketing savvy. Moody Blue is a perfect example. <br /> <br />Imagine if RCA had realized that they only had enough good material from the Graceland sessions in '76 for one album. Was this so uncommon at the time? Most bands and performers of that era went into the studio to record enough tracks for one album. Why was Elvis different? All he needed was 10 songs for an album. What if RCA had forgone the From Elvis Presley Boulevard album (a cheap attempt to cash in on recording at Graceland), and instead released Moody Blue? The idea of a blue record (as the original record was) in blue packaging would have been powerful. They still could have marketed the album as the first ever to be recorded at Graceland. What makes this even more tantalizing--or regrettable since it never happened--was that there were among these recordings some of the best and most heartfelt material Elvis had recoded since the '69 Memphis sessions, which by the way were marketed shoddily at the time, too.  <br /> <br />RCA had a chance to correct that mistake with this reissue, but instad chose to release everything they had--including the lousy live tracks that show how bad things were for Elvis. This album should have contained: Hurt; For The Heart; Moody Blue; Solitaire; He'll Have to Go; Way Down; Pledging MY Love; Blues Eyes Crying in the Rain; She Thinks I Still Care; It's Easy For You; <br /> <br />Moody Blue, with the kind of marketing a performer like Elvis deserved, would have been a huge hit, and would today rate as a classic. Elvis' last hurrah. Unfortunately, the album is evidence of the malaise of the King's last years. In fairness, Elvis didn't do much to change his fate. And the true nature of these recording sessions was chaotic at best with Elvis being alternately stoned silly or paranoid (he planned hits on local drug dealers). <br /> <br />One can't help but wonder what might have been if RCA had read the writing on the wall in the late 60s and saw where modern rock was going and applied that to Elvis' releases. Things would have been much different---at least from a musical standpoint. Alas, it wasn't.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This is a good album.....it is something nice to listen to....nothing different here....just something to enjoy once in a while......IT IS NO \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\"....and if you do not like the beatles...maybe something a little newer like the white stripes Elephant...we all know Bluesrock is the best rock. <br /> <br />-3-  <br /> <br />Goo Goo Gjoob
B000005S6H|5.0|I remember distinctle the first time that I heard a song played nick cave & the bad seeds. It was the summer of 1994 and he recorded his let love in album and I saw the video \\"do you love me\\" for the release \\"let love in\\".  This 1997 release the boatman's call sounds allot like Let love in. Nick Cave is a great lyricist and a decent vocalist. The book-let is very nice and the front cover photo is a photo of Mr. Cave dressed in some black coat with an artistic expression as if he was thinking. The lyrics are written in red ink on black background and the font is the right size that one can read the lyrics and who played on each track and which instruments that were used. I would like to know the brands...but one can not get all and there are much worst booklets out there, believe me.
B0006J28BO|4.0|Haru is a very nice girl. She helps her friends, and argues about which boys are the coolest - not that they seem to be arguing about her. She even helps stray cats: first that white kitten when she was little, then the gray one today, the one carrying the gift box.<br /><br />Gift box?<br /><br />That sets in motion a charming story along the lines of Alice in Wonderland. Haru unwittingly saves the prince of a magical cat kingdom. The king and all its citizens are now determined to thank her, whether she wants it or not. After getting in trouble for few dozen cats following her into school, and after finding dozens of gift-wrapped mice in her locker, \\"or not\\" is what she wants. A mysterious voice tells her to find the one who'll lead her to the Cat Bureau -<br /><br />and then it's down the rabbit hole, sort of. She follows the little white guide through mysterious passages, grows way too big for the house then as small as a kitten, tries to avoid the royal \\"Off with their heads\\" (or \\"out the window,\\" here), scatters the bright-colored but not-too-bright guards, and grows some lovely whiskers and a tail. There's lots more, centered on The Baron and guide/guard Mutu. There's excitement but no violence, and the unwanted marriage to the cat prince is a matter of white lace and ribbons more than adult fact.<br /><br />The story has a safe and happy ending, with Haru happier than ever just being herself. It moves well, it's animated well, and has some clever scenes. It's not for the more sophisticated child, though. Only younger kids or grown-ups are likely to enjoy it.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Megadeth is one of my favorite bands and 'Countdown to Extinction' is their best effort. This is the album that made Megadeth a huge success in the music industry and it will probably be remembered as Megadeth's finest hour. It was also recorded with Megadeth's best line-up. Dave, Marty, David, and Nick.  <br /> <br />From beginning to end this record will get your attention. There are no filler tracks to be found. Dave's classic snarl is used perfectly on songs such as Symphony of Destruction, Sweating Bullets, and Skin O My Teeth. The guitar work is some of the best that Megadeth has to offer, and Marty's solos are perfect. I cannot think of one thing bad that I can say about this recording. It is that good. <br /> <br />I would advise anyone that likes metal or rock music to pick up this masterpiece. What have you got to lose?   <br />   <br />
B0007DAZW8|5.0|When I went to buy this album, I was very excited...4 years is very long.I bought this album, I listen to it 1 time and I was very very disappointed.I was like:&quot;What's that??? What the hell......&quot; But the day after, I had the Human After All and Robot Rock riff in my head all day long. Maybe I was hoping of an album like Discovery which was awesome and also Homework. But this album is like a mix of these 2 albums. This album is excellent but they can do better...Their songs are long and it's pratically always the same riff all over the song.<br />1-Human After All 9/10 Very good opening song, catchy riff and simple<br />2-The Prime Time Of Your Life 8/10, The beginning is very good but they can do better on that one...<br />3-Robot Rock 10/10 Very awesome song, good single...<BR>4-Steam Machine 6/10 Not a big hit,long for nothing...<BR>5-Make Love 7/10 5 minutes and it's the same thing all over the song, there's only a fade-in and fade-out effect and that's all<br />6-The Brainwasher 7/10 At the beginning I was thinking of a Black Sabbath cover (Iron Man)...like a rave song, if I was the producer, I would have do a shorter song with this one...<br />7-On/Off Interlude<BR>8-Television Rules The Nation 8,5/10 Very cool song but it's the same riff again all the time ,but...anyways<BR>9-Technologic 10/10 Best song with a lot of lyrics, if someone learn that one, I'll give you a big hug ahhaahha<BR>10-Emotion 7/10 Like Make Love, it's long and there's not a big difference all over the song...<br />So if you're a Daft Punk fan, it's a great cd but if you don't know Daft Punk don't begin with this cd, go with Homework or Discovery...<BR>I give 4,5 stars on 5 for the beautifl album which you most listen a couple of time before really loving it
B0007O38F8|3.0|Despite what all these people are saying, The Massacre is not that bad.  I really liked most of the songs, and 50's style is still no way even remotely close to ja rule's.  If you have actually heard this cd, you would know that 50 still has it as a rapper.  Come on people, \\"Get in my Car\\" and \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\" are just a couple of examples of why 50 is here to stay.  Don't get me wrong, this album is not in the same league as Get Rich or Die Trying, but it is definetely worth purchasing.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No doubt is my favorite band and I love this cd but its not their best. I dont think they thought about it too much the songs on this album are too repetative for my liking. At first i only liked \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"In my Head\\". While on a road trip i listened to it non stop and the album really grew on me and i love it now. <br />MY FAVORITE TRACKS: Hella Good,Dont let me down, In my head, Platnum Blonde Life,Rock Steady. <br />WORST TRACKS: Making out, Detective, Waiting room. <br />
0307155102|5.0|I think I have to agree with the title of this book.  Richard Scarry wrote and illustrated what might be the best word book ever for kids.  I love Richard Scarry, especially his story books.  His pictures give just enough detail and complexity without overwhelming a child and he has a variety of ideas that keep things interesting.    \\"The Best Word Book Ever!\\" is great for young children who are really starting to manipulate things well and are recognizing more and more of the world around them.  My son is 17 months old and he loves the size of this book.  The pages are big and easy to turn (although the size lends to the pages ripping easier so keep the tape handy) and it fills his lap for a big viewing area in front of him.    Scarry has filled the book with more than enough themes to make this a book you can go back to again and again.  From pages that just list items like colors, parts of the body, kitchen items, the alphabet and numbers to scenes that bring in a wide array of related and unrelated words and pictures.  This includes one and two pages spreads of neighborhoods, firefighters, the beach, the city, the countryside, rooms in your house and more.  So if a child or parent is done with or bored with one page, the next page brings a different presentation.    The animal characters in the book are familiar to anyone who has read Richard Scarry and work well in presenting an everyday view of the world, even if rabbits don't really wear pants.  This helps when pointing out actions on the page (Where is the bear?  Who is driving the truck?).    As for negatives, they are few.  Yes, the books do seem to wear out and tear but I believe that is from the size and from the attention they receive from eager children.  Nothing wrong in that to me.  Also, I have no reason to compare this version to older versions.  If pages have changed or are missing, I don't notice and my son definitely doesn't notice or care.  He loves what is in there now and 72 pages is more than enough for him.  If this were a storybook, sure, I'd take issue, but this is still a Word book that has a big horizon of words and fulfills its purpose well.  My copy does not note a new edition but does mention new illustrations approved in 1980 so maybe the author updated it. (It is possible that some people are confusing this book with the similarly titled, \\"Richard Scarry's Biggest Word Book Ever!\\"  That may explain why it seems like pages are missing.)  Also, since the whole book is illustrated, if you want actual photographs of objects, it would be good to have another word book to cover that base.  And like any book, some of it might seem dated but it there is not much.  A rotary telephone still is recognized as a phone.    I'm sure this book will continue to get lots of use and love from my toddler and I'll be there with him a lot, looking at it too.
6305176299|2.0|There a few basic rules that movies must follow to create some sense of reality (such as the laws of physics) that the director of Speed has disregarded. I will give him credit, however, for taking a storyline that is thinner than a strand silk and squeezing out a 1 1/2 hour movie. The low point is the last scene when Sandra Bullock has somehow survived a gigantic train wreck handcuffed to handrail without getting her hands ripped off and she and Keanu Reeves calmly enjoy a long kiss and talk about all the great sex they are going to have.  This pathetic last-ditch effort to try to create a storyline made me gag.<br /><br />If you are looking for action videos that build some suspense and even have a few laughs, get an of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. They are all better than Speed.
B00004RFFM|3.0|This movie is trashy and makes sharks into evil robots. Genetically altered sharks with large brains attack their captors.

0141439475|5.0|Like a lot of people who avoid this book because they think they are familiar with the story, I continually passed this classic over until I had to read it for a class.<br />I was absolutely humbled and astonished that a girl of twenty-one could write such a fantastic story.<br />This book is not about some monsterish ogre who skulks the earth searching for victims...not at first. This was a being given life by an overzealous scientist and then promptly abandoned  because of his outer ugliness.<br />Victor Frankenstein's monster lives in solitude and finds ways to learn language etc... but what he really craves is love and some kind of mutual contact. This book says so much about the importance society places on appearances. Every time the \\"monster\\" tries to reach out to someone he is beheld with the utmost horror and disdain. He begs his creator to make him a female counterpart so that he may no longer be lonely. It is when the creator, Victor Frankenstein, selfishly refuses this favor that his creation torments everyone Victor loves.<br />This book necessarily makes one think about what they would do if they were the monster. There is logic, if not vengence in his actions. What he does to his creator is justified in his own mind, and you may very well find that you feel the  same way.<br />This is a quick one or two day read and I highly recommend it as a classic that will enrich your overall reading experience.
B000000W5L|1.0|That's what happened to me after listening to this. <br /> <br />Just woke up, what day is it, oh my God it's tomorrow, got to go to work, anywayz before I go. <br /> <br />This as you should know is well err...awlful, I mean the singer don't know his name, he can't sing...why can't he sing like Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey, he just screams, this isn't music it's just noise. <br /> <br />Also there's a song can't remember it, but it's a rip off of a Neil Young song IN THE COUNTRY have they been sued yet. <br /> <br />And why does he need to shine a light, shine a light on what??? <br /> <br />They can't write a song, why is this? <br /> <br />I don't know!!!!! <br /> <br />Give me Celine Dion any day <br /> <br />Near far wherever you are <br /> <br />BRILLIANT <br /> <br />The Stones can only dream of lyrics like this <br /> <br />Also Good Charlotte, what a band!!!! <br /> <br />And Linkin' Park <br /> <br />WOW <br /> <br />This is the music of the FUTURE <br /> <br />Not this I'm afraid!!!! <br /> <br />This is noise <br /> <br />P.S <br /> <br />The E stands for Expert
B000683VI4|5.0|I think that was because I saw the movie first.  The movie reflects more on the youthful relationship while the book goes more into detail of their reuniting and their elderly years in the nursing home. <br /> <br />Also, what really bothered me was the point in the movie when the old Noah is looking back at photos of his wedding and they showed pics of James Garner as a young man....with jet black hair and Gena Rowlands....with platinum blond hair!!  Well, the young Noah was light haired and the young Allie was strawberry blond....so were we supposed to think that the young Noah and Allie that we were watching the whole time were just figments of an elderly woman's imagination?????????  The two who portrayed Allie and Noah in their youth looked NOTHING LIKE the wedding photographs in the album. <br /> <br />But, overall, I loved the movie, saw it twice and bought the DVD.
1577311523|5.0|An excellent work! Eckhart brings so many spiritual Ideas together. I saw many critical reviews of this great work. Don't buy them. Know-betting will get you nowhere. When you read this book, read it like you would drink a fine wine. Pause often to reflect and enjoy its flavor. If you watch yourself--watch the thinker--choicelessly in the now, everything of importance will be revealed to you, perhaps not instantly, but in time. Time itself is not really necessary, but our heavy conditioning makes it difficult to slow the mind down, and everyone has to start somewhere. The Power Of Now helps you start wherever you are. If an idea seems strange to you at first, do not stress over it. Just reserve judgement until the truth shines through. Authentic spirituality does not require beleif, only perception--perception in the now.
B000003T9B|5.0|Overkill are probably the most consistent metal band around, as they never slack off and take a couple of years off between albums, and the albums they do make are consistently good.  Tomorrow, Overkill will release their 13th studio album of original material.  No other thrash band has more than about 8 or 9. (Well American thrash bands, anyway. Some foreign bands are less lazy)  Currently, I have 9 Overkill studio albums, and they're definitely all worth keeping.  Their debut, 'Feel the Fire' is one of the better ones, and is also superior to any of the debuts by the Big Four of thrash metal.  Pretty impressive stuff.<br /><br />Though this album was released in 1985, Overkill had been around for quite a while at that point, and much of the material on this album was written by 1983.  Thus, it is a bit more primitive, proto-thrashy than some of the other 1985 albums, though it is definitely more thrashy most of the pre-1985 material.  Where it stands in history doesn't matter much though, all that matters is that it's excellent.  Still, since they first released an album in `85 some may think them bandwagon jumpers, which I'm quite sure is not the case.<br /><br />The production on this album is very rough, though rough in a way that accentuates the intensity of the album rather than diminishing it.  And, at this point, Overkill wasn't so big on subtlety, so you ain't likely to miss too much.  The guitar is dead center, accentuating the fact that they only had one guitarist at the time, and the bass is a bit louder than in most thrash.  As a whole, though it is a thrash album, it does have quite a bit of a punkish speed-metal vibe going on, making the whole thing kinda feel like thrashified Motorhead. (though there is some distinct Iron Maiden influence, at times)  This sound works for the whole Overkill feel and persona, particularly Blitz's vocals, which are surprisingly good here.  He lets out lotsa nice screams.  The riffs are generally simple, but plenty crunchy and effective.  Gustafson's leads aren't the height of originality, but they sound good, and complement the riffwork well.  The rhythm work is effective, but perfunctory.  Still, it's enough.<br /><br />'Second Son' is the weak point of the album.  It's alright, but not very memorable.  'Rotten to the Core' is a classic, and pretty ahead of it's time, sounding more like Anthrax than Anthrax did, at the time.  Great shout along chorus.  'Hammerhead' is a very fun, driving number.  Has got a nice Maiden gallop and another great shout along chorus.  The title track is probably the best thing here.  Total Maiden worship, particularly by the rhythm section, done about as well as anyone has ever done.  The middle break is totally sweet, particularly Blitz's crazy vocals.  'Blood and Iron' is another rocker, with the finest, most intense riffwork on the album.  Nothing fancy, of course, but metal doesn't always need to be.  'Kill at Command' is most notable for it's awesome middle break, with some fine leadwork and great, backing vocals.  'Overkill' is another classic, with some over the top, 'scary' atmosphere, a totally unforgettable main riff and another insane performance from Blitz. (Particularly the shrieking)<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  If you like thrash you need to hear this.ve.

B0007QJ1MK|3.0|Something odd happened the other day when I first heard this album. I was in a state of exhilaration, my mouth was literally watering as I hit play. And it stayed that way until about track 10, 'The Blood is Love.' After that, my mind drifted to back to, well, other things. I got bored. Bored with a Queens album? Blasphemy! But it happened. I've never listened to a Queens CD and skipped tracks. I'm doing it on this one though. After listening to everything the Queens have done and comparing it to Lullabies, you can truly appreciate the raw, unbridled, bitchin bass playing Nick Oliveri. You shall be missed my naked dwarf, and so shall your bad ass bass lines and disgusting screech.
B000000WCV|4.0|Daft Punk, what can I say?  Some of their songs are going to be classics, and this album includes a few of them.  While some of the songs and this album may be duds, several of them stand out besides the hits Da Funk and Around the World.  Revolution 909, Hi Fidelity, and Alive go well with this album.  One of the halmarks of Daft Punks sound is there ability to exploit the repetiveness of a beat, so more progressive minded fans may want to skip this one. <br /> <br />As far as buying this album, if your low on cash or not a fan of Daft Punk's other work, you might want to skip this one.  There are a few songs on this album that aren't worth paying money to listen to frankly.  However, if you are a fan or want to hear some other quality tracks this group has come out with, I would encourage you to buy this album.
B000058983|5.0|This is perhaps one of the finest albums ever!!!  <br />Nothing but masterpiece can be used to describe this album, the greatest secret of the 1960's for sure.  <br />From start to finish brilliant. Highlights include A House is not a Motel, Andmoreagain, Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark and Hilldale, and my personal favourite You Set the Scene.  <br />If you're an open minded music fan who is willing to listen to something different then this album is for you, if you're expecting hard rock stuff, then you'll be dissapointed.  <br />
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I need to address the comments of longshotex - Firstly, the characters do not speak with an Italian accent because they are American actors.  It doesnt seem to matter that the Ghibli films set in Japan (Mononoke, Spirited Away etc) dont have actors speaking with Japanese accents.      Secondly, the character of Porco is deliberately distant.  He considers himself to be essentially worthless to the world, and nothing more than a coward for thinking of himself at a time when his friends were in need.  Consequently he withdrew from the society around him.  The film is essentially showing the events leading up to his acceptance as a human being once more.  Thus you are not expected to identify with him that much, just understand his motives for being how he is.      Thirdly, while the ending to the film is admitedly quite abrupt, the clues are in the last few scenes as to whether things have turned out right or not - you just have to pay attention.  I think personally that a film which gives the viewer a little nudge in the direction of the fate of the characters but leaves the imagination to flesh it out is a good film.  If a film spoon-feeds the viewer too much information, it becomes good ammunition for those who believe TV/films rot childrens minds, and Miyazaki can never be accused of that.    For me, Porco Rosso is just as good as any other Miyazaki film - and as anyone who has other examples of his work will know, thats a pretty high praise.  True, its a slight departure from his normal situations and stories but the same basic threads shine through regardless.  Excellent animation, beautiful watercolour backgrounds, appealing characters and a plot that doesnt get predictable or feel like its being worked from a template.  Hisaishi also does a cracking music score as usual.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a GREAT movie! You won't be disappointed. Even my husband was moved to tears (and that is saying a lot!).
068987474X|4.0|I know the problem that a lot of women have with this book. They say the book is too geared towards the male ego. But I believe that this book does something that is incredibly hard for any friend to do: be brutally honest. We have all been in the situations where a friend comes to us begging us for advice about her love life. We really want to tell her the truth. That the guy is not worth it and just not that into her, but its hard to do. How can you tell such an amazing woman this worthless male is simply not that interested in you? So often we do the opposite. We tell her to wait and see. He'll come around. The best thing about this book is that it says screw waiting find someone else. The greatest point the book makes is that you are too wonderful to wait around for some guy to get a clue while there is a great guy out there who would be great for you. Its all about not wasting time. However, I would not recommend reading this book when you are in a REALLY bad mood because it can be depressing, but hearing this kind of advice is necessary. I am certainly the type of person who likes to live in denial. Denial is a nice place to be but IT IS NOT REALITY. This book is like a wakeup call or metaphorically speaking it makes you just pull off the bandaid really really fast. Sure it hurts, but why slowly torture yourself? <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|With 888 reviews before me --I will not bore you to tell you how great the album is --just some points the other reviewers (no... I did not read them all) seem to miss. If there is one who reiterated any of my points... I apologize .. <br /> <br />1) This is not the first concept Album but then again neither was Pet Sounds...that honor goes to Ol Blue Eyes himself --Frank Sinatra in 1955 with the classic In The Wee Small Hours(on Capitol by the way) was recorded in 1955 a full 12 years before Pepper, the first 12 inch concept album. <br /> <br />2) If one is lucky to get the rare mono album of Pepper -u are in for a real treat ---the mix is different and I swear there are different takes than the normal Stereo mix of the album. <br /> <br />3) The Pepper Album is not overated at all it deserves every alcolade it gets-It truly is THE CLASSIC ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME. <br /> <br />

0670033375|2.0|I'm an old fan of Diamond, but with each book I like him less. \\"Collapse\\" isn't really about science or ecology or the lessons of history, but how to sell books. Take a no-argument topic (People can destroy their environment,) add urgency (This is happening to us!)get some research assistants to dig up what interesting facts they can (even if they get them wrong,) and get a saleable author to provide some paragraph links and put his name to it, and everyone makes a buck (except the consumer.) <br /> <br />You can keep publishing costs down by eliminating editors and proofreaders, e.g.: \\"...for the benefit of the corpses of the souls\\" instead of \\"the souls of the corpses.\\" (p.237) <br /> <br />There are plenty of astonishing facts too: We learn that the Norse ships took \\"a week or more\\" to cover the 2000-plus sailing miles from Norway to Greenland (Given the means of navigation and the weather in those latitutes, truth is, six weeks would have been a quick trip.) But then time ran backward in those days, because, according to Diamond, Erik the Red assumed that artifacts he found on his first visit to Greenland were left by the Vinland Skraelings. (Trouble is, the discovery of Vinland came 20 years after the discovery of Greenland, so at the time Erik knew nothing of either the land or the people his son Leif later came upon.) <br /> <br />Virtually all of the information on Norse settlements and culture is lifted from a single source, The Vikings, The North Atlantic Saga, by Fitzshugh and Ward eds., published by the Smithsonian in conjunction with its recent touring exhibition. There's no reason to believe Diamond actually read any of the other books in his bibliography, or he'd realize much of the scholarship, such as the work done by Jesse Byock, actually contradicts his conclusions.  <br /> <br />Obviously Diamond knows better, but the book was obviously slapped together fast and marketed. <br /> <br />Read the book and enjoy it, but don't trust a single fact in it. Double check everything.
B000003C5C|3.0|I have no idea who this band is but I just wanted to shout out to Pete and his ignorant post on the 50 Cent album. AND I HATE 50 CENT, BUT HE DISSED ALL RAP MUSIC SAYING IT TAKES NO TALENT. You say they don't have talent just 'cause they don't play instruments? Well, I'll say that your type of music could never move me strictly with the lyrics as Hiphop is often capable of. Nothing is as profound and deep as some of the Hiphop out there. But of course Pete seems to judge Hiphop by lame ass 50 Cent! Now I can see if you despise 50 Cent but to call out all Hiphop? <br />You're just ignorant if you think music just has to be all instruments. Have you forgotten the lyrics? No genre can touch most underground Hiphop lyrically. I respect those who master an instrument but that can only take you so far. Hiphop explores and destroys lyrical boundaries. Like I said I respect those who play instruments, but all these kids grow up just playing their guitar or their drums, that lyrics seem to be a second-thought. Huh? Oh yeah, he took one of the worst rappers and quoted one of his simplest lyrics, then seemed to think it was fair to compare it to a good quote from one of his Death Metal bands or whatever. Why don't I just find the weakest commercial representation of your genre and find the lamest quote then compare it to a monumental quote from one of Hiphop's finest? Hell, I could find hundreds of Hiphop quotes that are just as deep and profound or even more significant than the one you offered from your death metal band! <br />I'm not hating Pete, just wanted to guide you from dropping that ignorant bias you showed on 50 Cent's reviews! You think that 50 Cent really represents our Hiphop Culture you're sadly mistaken. You're just searching for a reason to keep us down. Just show some freakin' respect for our music as we do for yours! I may not personally prefer your type of music, but I damn sure respect it and don't blatantly and blindly diss it, just as you should show thesame respect! True Hiphop is all about upliftment of the listener and expansion of the mind through the power of words! Did you ever know that? Did you know that Hiphop is not just a music, it's been a culture since the 1970's and has expanded internationally? <br />PEACE

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I picked this up from a seller in Russia, which forced me to wait almost 30 days for it to get to me. I had been filling out my collection since buying 3 Marillion cd's in one shot about 5 years ago, those being \\"Brave\\", \\"Season's End\\", and \\"Clutching at Straws\\". I'd since bought \\"This Strange Engine\\", and with those four - all of which have immensely enjoyable moments - I have to say I like \\"Brave\\" and \\"..Engine\\" the best.<br /><br /> Now comes \\"Marbles\\", and I am so impressed and so moved that this CD goes with me wherever I am. I listen to it at work, in my car, and at home on my computer.<br /><br /> I find this music - and Steve Hogarth's emotional vocalizations - immensely compelling. Favorite tracks are \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\", \\"You're Gone\\", \\"Neverland\\", \\"Angelina\\", and \\"Fantastic Place\\". Come to think of it, there isn't a stinker or even a so-so track on this whole album. The \\"Marbles\\" interludes are fascinating, and the keyboard work opening \\"Marbles 3\\" is simple, yet effective.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this CD to Marillion fans and progressive rock fans in general. Probably will be the best CD I buy all this year!
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Now this is more like it. Yes, I know a lot of the North American and European fans are moaning about the number of Donna Summer compilations available. Well here in AFrica we dont have that problem the last one was 1994's Endless Summer...this one however DESERVES an international release as it perfectly updates 1993's ANTHOLOGY and encapsulates Donna's groundbreaking 70's work, more experimental 80's, 90's and 2000's return to dance. Unlike the others available this one includes almost ALL the major hits and deserves 5 stars for including DINNER WITH GERSHWIN and THERE GOES MY BABY, MELODY OF LOVE, I WILL GO WITH YOU and WHEN LOVE CRIES all major hits out here.  <br /> <br />Having said all of the above though...2003's You're So Beautiful, and I will Live for Love show that Ms Summer still has what it takes and its time for a MAJOR NEW ALBUM...in order to show all these wannabe divas how its done.
B0002OERI0|4.0|arite... I first listened to this album about 2 weeks ago when my sister got it (i hadn't bought it myself cuz i thought it was gonna be terrible, but man was i wrong!) first off, this album is not as consistent as albums like \\"dookie\\" or \\"insomniac\\", but with those two albums being so great, the only way you can go is down, unfortanately! anyway, here is the rundown... <br /> <br />1. American Idiot- great way to kick off the album. it felt good to be blown out by Green Day after 4 years of waiting for this album. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia- personally, i LOVE the 5 part pieces on this album. i think jesus of suburbia is a great mix of cathcy riffs and lyrics (typical green day), and is my 3rd favorite song on the album. all the songs here sound like they could have been stripped right off of nimrod. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Holdiay- i dont know what it is about this song, but something makes it really fun to listen to. and has heartwarming lyrics 4 all u anti-bush people out there! ill get back to you if i ever find this thing out (cool video too)! 4.5/5 <br /> <br />4. Blvd of Broken Dreams- this is by far the most popular song on the album, but its really irratating. this is in my bottom 3 songs on the album. 2/5 <br /> <br />5.Are we the waiting- i'm definitly not a fan of this song... kinda boring. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />6. st. jimmy- far and away the best song on the album! explosive, power chord riffs and clever, addicting lyricsmake this song bring me back to the dookie days (which is a great thing)! i wish this song would get more media attention so everyone would see how much a*s green day can still kick! love this song! 6/5 <br /> <br />7. give me novacaine- umm see review for are we the waiting. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />8. shes a rebel- i like this song... a lot! brings me back to that mid 90s green day sound. awesome stuff. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. extroadinary girl- see the reviews for give me novacaine and are we the waiting. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb- wicked! this song is one of my favorites on the album. edgy sound w/ sentimental lyrics. this song is really unique too. like, it doesn't sound anything like green day has done in the past. solid song. 4/5 <br /> <br />11. wake me up when september ends- the only slow, acoustic song that works on this album. its an alright little song, but 0% edgy. don't let that dissapoint you though. its still very good. 4/5 <br /> <br />12. homecoming- like i said before, the 5-part pieces rock hard. this is better than jesus of suburbia and is my 2nd favorite song on the album. really clever lyrics, really easy to relate to, and theres definitly a guest performer in rock and roll girlfriend, but i dont know who it is (his voice sounds sooo irratating, makes me appreciate just how good billi joe sounds). very unique sound, and umm, im not sure how to describe it... just listen to this and jesus of suburbia and you'll know what i mean! it kix a*s. <br /> <br />13. whatsername- never mind my statement before that wake me up when september ends is only slow song that works. this sound pretty good, just has no edge. not for the eardrum bleeding, blisteringly powerful type! 4/5 <br /> <br />overall, this is a great album. i'm very impressed considering that the last few albums were a bit dissapointing. i know green day is proud of this and they should be! worthy of the grammy! if you don't have this album and are a fan of green day, BUY THIS NOW!!! i command you!!! however, if your planning on making this your first green day purchase, reconsider (go for dookie or insomniac, which are CLASSICS!) <br /> <br />green day is beastly and this album is no exception. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B0000AFQS0|5.0|*Original Who performances remastered in DTS and Dolby Digital.      *Original video clips remastered from the original source film.    *Original interviews with the Who telling their own story.     If you`re a fan you must own this, if you`re taking an intro course to Who 101, this is required viewing.    From the moment Pete`s guitar comes crashing through the FBI warning to the bonus disc to the solo bass Enwistle track and interactive tour of Who History in London, this is pure 100% maximum Who R&B. This video captures the historical and cultural importance of The Who better than any other video I`ve seen.    What more can you say?    Rock doesn`t hold up under close scrutiny as Daltry points out, and good rock has no musical \\"quality\\", as Townshend implies...     So buy this album and let the music speak for itself (even in DTS if you so desire)...
B00008BXJF|5.0|Heavy, guitar-based music just doesn't get done more masterfully than this right here.
0375507256|4.0|I haven't finished this dizzying, mind stretching, humbling riveting read yet - but just had to encourage others to buy this books.  Humane, moving, scary and . . . well, words can't do it justice, six interwoven stories that follow the path of a comet shaped birth mark - the fact that this \\"constant\\", mentioned in each story is a small insignificant thing just adds to the wonder of the book. <br /> <br />Seriously an amazing read, I don't need to know how it ends to recommend it!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This dvd is another good one video and audio are great and the show is great. this dvd is full of stars and if you like the rockin blues you will love this, buy it you won't be disapointed from person who knows good music dvds I have 75 some good and some bad.
B00005JNQQ|2.0|Robots is a nice visual journey but not much else. The character development is weak to none, so the viewer really doesn't become attached to anyone. The story centers around a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom (Ewen McGregor) who leaves his parents to go to Robot City and find his way as an inventor. His seeks out his idol, the master inventor Big Weld (Mel Brooks) who has mysteriously taken a \\"leave of absence\\". Along the way, Rodney encounters some friends and uncovers the mystery of Big Weld's disappearence. Robin Williams turns in a surprisingly uninspired performance as Fender who becomes Rodney's best bud. I can't put my finger on it exactly but Robots is missing something, I suspect heart. If you look at great children's films of the past ten years (Monsters Inc, Toy Story, Finding Nemo) they all endeared us to their central characters first and then told the story. Robots gives very little background information and jumps quickly into the plot. It seems as if Halle Berry's character Cappy was a useless write-in just to cash-in on star power, as her character has no essential purpose other than taking Rodney to Big Weld's home. Overall, Robots is probably a journey better left untaken; the litmus test I use is my 3 year old son and his reaction to the film was indifference. Bottom line: cable fare at best.
B000002GQL|4.0|Most people's main observation about this album is how sad sounding it is, and the Moodie's own bad feelings during that time have been well documented. However, once you get past that, it really is a wonderful part of the Moody Blues story. Yes, songs like New Horizons and Isn't Life Strange are very sad, there are a few very happy and optimistic moments on the album, namely Land Of Make Believe and You and Me. The Moodies never could be totally negative, and this album proves that. And Ray, God bless him, as he so often does brightens things up marvelously with For My Lady.  Although it is one of the most introspective of the classic seven, it is also one of the best.
068485743X|5.0|I was surprised that there were any ratings under five stars for this book.  It is superb and an absolute must for anyone hoping to be published.  Start out on the right foot and get this book.  It will save you lots of time and trouble.  Whenever I recommend books on writing, this is the one I recommend.  And if I were a teacher of writing, this would be required reading.
B00005JMJG|4.0|The thought that went into the script is unbelieveable.  The idea is a great one and execution is amazing.  Not a huge Jim Carey fan but I loved his performance as well as the rest of this talented cast.
B000002JK2|4.0|An album that won awards and critical acclaim, but did not get much help from the label, \\"Rough Mix\\" puts the Who's Pete Townshend and Small/Faces Bassist Ronnie Lane together for an exploration of rock, folk, country and other tangents. <br /> <br />Lane was looking for some help after getting out of the Faces, and he encouraged Townshend to work with him.  The album included famous friends such as Eric Clapton and Charlie Watts, and is famous to me for its ecelctic nature. <br /> <br />\\"My Baby Gives It Away\\" is a rocker that has its moments, \\"Annie\\" is a folky number of the kind Lane indulged in (very heartfelt)--\\"Misunderstood\\" is an odd number that perhaps showed a bit of Townshend's dark side, as did \\"Street in the City.\\"  \\"Keep Me Turning\\" has turned up as a Townshend favorite in shows with his own band, and on the recent Royal Albert Hall release with the Who. <br /> <br />All very interesting, but the kicker to me was the cover of \\"Til The Rivers All Run Dry.\\"  The Don Williams hit was really nicely done. <br /> <br />Sadly, Lane was already suffering the effects of MS, but didn't let on, and his performance does not suffer.  One of those odd albums you just can't pigeonhole, and good for that. <br /> <br />
B00000272N|5.0|for me facelift is the best album of alice in chains. along with soundgarden this band was the heavier band in the seattle grunge scene and facelift is the prove of it.great songs with a fabulous lyrism; a fantastic guitar played by jerry cantrell and the vocals of a genius- Layne Staley.i can't make a nomination for the best song(s) of this album because all of them are really good and you should listen to them.
B000002P2V|5.0|The recent remastering of the Who CDs for the most part I think has been done well, and I'm glad to see the live and unreleased tracks getting to the light of day.  I just wish there were more of this from the back catalog, than the constant reissuing of the \\"Greatest Hits.\\" <br /> <br />Oh, well I digress. <br /> <br />The Who were at a pivotal time as they regrouped for what would become the \\"Who Are You\\" album.  For the most part, they were hitting on three cylinders, as Keith Moon returned from LA, overweight, out of shape and out of practice. <br /> <br />His problems were well-documented by many, but his weren't the only ones.  Studio problems, injuries to Townshend and \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick, a fight between Daltrey and producer Glyn Johns and a bunch more marred and slowed the work.  Eventually Johns left and Jon Astley took over producing the album.   <br /> <br />Moon got the ship righted and the result is an album that paid homage to rock, but also noted the punk explosion, with the Who trying to find a space amidst that and disco. <br /> <br />\\"New Song\\" cuts right to the chase at the beginning, Townshend's clever track talking about the treadmill he and band were on (he felt).  \\"Sister Disco\\" thunders along, and the 6/8 timed \\"Music Must Change\\" is a textural dream, with some nice guitar work from Pete.  Keith couldn't handle the drumming for this, but added good minimal cymbal and percussion. <br /> <br />John Entwistle continued with strong bass work, and three songs, \\"905,\\" \\"Guitar and Pen\\" and \\"Trick of the Light.\\"  All good, and there's a different version of the second on the remaster. <br /> <br />Daltrey was consistantly strong, especially on the title track, and really all the way through. <br /> <br />The swan song for Moon was a decent one, and the band showed that even at their dark periods, they could still get it together.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Wow, they really tried with this movie to attain a certain feel.  It didn't work. <br /> <br />Buy Dick Tracy - that one worked.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This is a typical quirky comedy from the sixties! Some may like it, and some may not.<br /><br />But, if you're a Mini Cooper fan, or merely a car enthusiast (the opening scene, with a Lamborghini Miura driving thru the italian Alps is awesome!), you have to see this film!<br /><br />The Mini Coopers are the real stars in this film! The already mentioned Lamborghini Miura, a DB-4 Aston Martin, a Daimler, a couple of E-type Jaguars, and a bunch of late sixties italian cars such as Alfa Romeos and FIATs are the supporting stars!<br /><br />This is undoubtedly a car enthusiast's film! A must for Mini Cooper lovers!
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|Alright, it's getting two stars because there's two good songs on it, and that's the ONLY reason it gets two stars. This CD and this band is so over rated it makes me sick. If they would have been around say 20 years ago, they would have fit right in with their 80s hair band sounding drivel. The lyrics aren't bad, there's a few lines that make you go HELL YEAH, but for the most part, BOREDOM sets in around the 4th or 5th track. And only lets up on one or two songs. So I've already let it go to someone else who wanted the CD but couldn't pay for it. I'll stick with my obscure bands that no one has ever heard of. As for this CD, the best thing about it is the cover. SO, goodbye QOTSA, until next time.......
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is undoubtedly a great action film! It has a very good story and some truly great actors working in it! However, the real stars here are the MINI Coopers!!! So much so that it has become an iconic film among MINI enthusiasts!<br /><br />This is an essential film for any MINI Cooper lover! If you own a MINI, this is the DVD to have in your glove compartment!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|An outstandingly beautiful collection of celtic songs definatley worth every penny. Between the peaceful yet effective sounds of the irish fiddle and the heavenly voices it is possibly one of the most worthwhile classical albums.
B00004YTZE|5.0|After the break up of the New York Dolls in 1975 drummer Jerry Nolan and guitarist Johnny Thunders formed the Heartbreakers.  Along with the brilliant Walter Lure on guitar, the band went to the UK in 1976 to open shows for The Sex Pistols' Anarchy Tour.  <br />While most gigs were cancelled Johnny and Jerry were able to introduce the young British punks to heroin.   <br />Every young punk rocker idolized Johnny Thunders and wanted to be like him so they all jumped in head-first into his lifestyle.    <br />1977 The Heartbreakers cut thier only album, L.A.M.F. (Like A Motherfu....).  The origional mix was murky but in 1994 Thunders' friends and fans found the origional tapes and remixed them into this top notch hard rocking disc (the final two cuts are bonus tracks not on the origional album). <br />While all his followers died from drug overdoses (Sid Vicious, a few guys from The Pretenders, etc.) Johnny carried on putting out a new album every few years while focusing all his attention on staying loaded until he finally ODed in 1991.   Jerry Nolan followed him a few months later. <br />Sad story of the man Richard Hell called, \\"The Dean Martin of heroin\\" but he is a legend and this album is a classic.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Many many reviewers have written about the plot of this movie, so I am not going to waste anyone's time rewriting it.  I was surprised to see reviewers complain that they were misled ino thinking that this was going to be a romantic comedy, or who were grossed out by some of the BDSM aspects of the movie.  It is definately not your typical romantic comedy.  The leading lady is a cutter who has just been released from the mental hospital.  The leading man is an incredibly repressed attorney who can't keep a secretary.   That being said, this manages to be one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.  These two people are so damaged and so unlikely to find love, but they do, with each other.  I have watched this movie at least 10 times because it affirms my faith in the idea that there is someone for each of us.
0771008538|3.0|I am a seventeen year old girl and this book really struck a chord within me. The things that the girls did to Elaine sent a chill down my spine but they didn't shock me. At all. I had friends much like Elaine's and I wouldn't be surprised if I had once been a friend like that. <BR>The novel was well written and the first half of it had me entranced but as the novel continued on, I felt as though Atwood had grown bored with the plot. I forced myself to finish the book just because I had read two of her other novels (The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake) and loved them.

B0001LJC2K|4.0|A friend recommended Muse to me not too long ago, and not knowing anything about them, I gave them a listen. I have to say I was very surprised by just how much I liked them. <br /> <br />Yes, they sound like Radiohead. We get it, but that's why some of us actually like them. If you're a highly devoted Radiohead fan and despise any band that sounds remotely like them, then this is not the album for you. If you miss the sound Radiohead stopped producing a long time ago, then you have to pick this album up. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is pretty solid. There aren't any songs that I feel I have to skip over. It's great from start to finish. It contains some of the best songwriting and instrumentation I've heard from a recent band.
0743454537|3.0|Let me preface this with I HAVE NOT FINISHED THIS BOOK YET.  So if you are worried about spoilers, have no fear.  I am very torn about this book, none the less.  I have really enjoyed it, it grabbed my attention from the get go and I am still very into it. I want to go home and read it right now.  I like that each chapter is from a different character's point of view.  I have deepest sympathy for everyone, but very little for the mother who seems intent on sacrificing one child for another. However, I have worked in both kidney and bone marrow transplant which gives me difficulty in suspending my disbelief or believing in poetic license.  There is not a transplant center in this country that would take a kidney from someone who is not old enough to give consent.  That is even a problem if the parent (and potential donor) of a child is under 18.  Some centers require someone to be 21 years of age before they would allow them to give a kidney.  Additionally, the point is driven home that Kate will die without a kidney transplant which is unlikely, given that there are two types of dialysis available to those who have end stage renal disease.  It is not like a heart or liver transplant, where you have no other options.  All that rambling aside, I really like this book.  I just wish that the medical end had been a little further investigated.  I know, I should get a life . . .
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I found it to be a great mix of music.  I also came to find out from a foreign exchange student from Russia that the translation to \\"Ya Soshla S Uma\\" is actually \\"I Have Lot My Mind.\\"  And as he translated the rest of the Russian song, it turned out to be nothing like the English sung in \\"All The Things She Said.\\"  The words \\"mne nuzha ona, mne nuzha ona\\" spoken between the opening \\"ya soshla s uma\\" is translated to \\"I need her, I need her.\\"  I'm not sure what to think of the rest of the translation.  But, overall, I very much like the music.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I think having a rudimentary grasp of the English language is really detrimental to the enjoyment of this album. Perhaps to a Georgian goat herder from the Caucasus these new western pop sounds might be pleasing to the ear but the bland, lowest common-denominator melodies and insipid lyrics will leave the ear of the discerning listener rather bored and slightly irritated.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|i remember the first time i heard daft a while ago. one of the tracks off discovery and one of my friends encouraged me to go buy it. it grew on me after a while, and now is currently #2 on my favorite albums of all time. i bought homework a while after discovery, and was also impressed with that. so after 4 or so years of waiting, my friend gets an internet leak of human after all. my pants literally flew off at the thought. he burns me a copy of the cd after sending me robot rock to hold me until he could get some more blanks. the second i came in contact with the cd, i threw it in my cd player and let it run. i was sent into immediate depression at the lack of musicality daft put into it. the whole album just looped. nothing changed. i posted a review in my blog warning whoever read it to stay away and let someone burn it for you. someone then pitched the idea that because it was an internet leak, it could just be parts thrown together by some kid in their basement. i accept this idea, but to my demise, itunes released it and it was the same exact thing. this is why you should just burn it from someone who has it and go buy discovery. <br /> <br />tracks: <br />primetime A+ <br />human after all A+ <br />robot rock A+ <br />make love B+ <br />steam machine C- <br />technologic B <br /> <br />i dont necessarily feel like rating all the tracks, but the first three and make love and technologic are the best tracks of the 9(not counting on/off)
B000002MIB|4.0|I love this CD even though a lot of people bash.  It is a live CD therfore it shouldn't sound exactly like the studio versions.  I agree at times the mix is a little rough but still great.  I saw VH on the tour promoting this CD back in '93 and it is still one of the greatest concerts I've ever been to.  Alot of people feel Sammy is not the half the showman that DLR is err! was but that's bull.  I like the Hagar and Roth eras of VH but VH just seemed more like a true band with Sammy where Roth was always trying to hog the spotlight.  Sammy does a great job on \\"Ain't Talkin Bout Love\\".  The only Roth song on here I feel that is not up to par is \\"Panama\\". Sure there are some flaws sound wise but once you get past that it's great.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that you never get tired of watching, I have lost count on how many times I have seen it but it must be somewhere around 15 times.  The Goonies is about a group of kids that find a map that leads to a lost treasure ship, along the way they encounter a series of booby traps and pursued be a group of criminals (a mother and her two sons). But I don't know why I am explaining the movie I mean seriously who has never seen The Goonies.  If you are one of the unfortunate people that have never seen it trust me you will not me disappointed.
B00006WKY9|5.0|This CD is the most beautiful one I own. The opening song called 'Steamrock Fever' is very cool, then you have 'We'll Burn The Sky' this one also rocks, and it belongs to my favorite Scorpion-ballad. Then 'I've Got To Be Free', this one is a very good rocker, 'The Riot of Your Time' shows the melodic rock-side of the Scorpions. And 'the Sails Of Charon' and 'Your Light' are typically Roth compositions, not ugly! No, wonderful, but he always starts with a guitar intro.... I'm happy he left the band after the Tokyo Tapes, ofcourse, he's a good rocker, and he writes good music, but at the 'In Trance' album, he really sucks (who likes 'the Sun In My Hand'?). But about this album: 'He's A Woman, She's A Man' it's a VERY GOOD song, I love it. A good advice: read the lyrics, you can laugh about it. Next: 'Born To Touch Your Feelings', people say this song is the most wonderful ballad ever, like in Der Kommissar's review, but I absolutely disagree with that point. It's nice, but not great. It's takes more than 7 minutes of time, and the 'real' song is finished after 5 minutes. But next is 'Suspender Love', I like it better in live, but this one is still rocking. And last but not least: 'Polar Nights (live)', this one is taken from the Tokyo Tapes live-album, and it's just wonderful, and the guitar intro in the beginning, just very nice. It's a guitar intro which can only be played so nice by Ulrich Roth. The singing voice isn't so great, but come on, you're a Scorps-fan or not. Keep On Rocking!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park remains at #2 of my top five favorite films of all time. Everything about it is just amazing and magical. <br /> <br />Acting: <br />The whole cast did an amazing job, but in particular, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards, Sam Neill and Laura Dern did the best and gave their 100%. Jeff Goldblum, Samuel L. Jackson, Richard Attenborough and Bob Peck also did magnifacent jobs at acting in their roles. The cast also fit their roles perfectly! <br /> <br />Direction: You would expect the direction of a movie thats directed by Steven Spielberg to be creative and original and well...it is, the direction of Spielberg adds originality as well as tension and chills to the already magical and thrilling as well as frightning scenes. <br /> <br />CGI/Anamotronics: The animatronics and CGI were just, whats the word?...AMAZING! I would say Jurassic Park and it's first seqeul have the best CGI/Ani to date, the dinosaurs are just so realistic and look so real that you wish you were inside this theme park ride. <br /> <br />This film contians some of the most memorable scenes of all time which include SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: When Tim and Lex Murphy(Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) are trapped in the kitchen and are being stalked by Velociraptors, the scene is ultimatley chilling as well as magical and jaw dropping. Another scene is the Tyrannosaurus Rex's first appearence in which it attacks and overturns the explorer car that Tim and Lex are inside of, the whole scene is magical and terrifying. The film is great from a very chilling scene to one of the best climaxes I've seen from a movie! The movie is just...magnificent, and ear pounding, one of the best movie scores of all time! This movie is just so many things put together. If you haven't seen this film yet then where the heck have you been??? You have to see this film!
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell's latest is a breezy, enjoyable read that unfortunately left me wondering about the whole point of the book.   <br /> <br />The discussions of the way we intuit, or thin-slice things, can be fascinating.  However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach.  I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice. <br /> <br />This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point.  While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end.
B0000060NH|5.0|I'm glad the previous reviewer called the Amazon \\"expert\\" on his disparagement of Trouble Man, but I winced when he himself put Marvin's oeuvre down (with the exception of Trouble Man). I am comforted, however, by the fact that in the self same sentence in which he dismissed Marvin's other albums, he lauded this one for the very things that make the other albums magnificent works of art. My friend, do thine self a favour and give albums like 'Here, My Dear', 'Let's Get It On', 'I Want You', 'Vulnerable' et al a good spin. You'll swallow your words. That I promise you.
B000065V1V|5.0|This is the one we've been waiting for. A fine return to form with a contemporary twist. Heathen is just simply brilliant!  The album seamlessly marries the lighthearted and bubbly Bowie reminiscent of \\"Kooks\\" from Hunky Dory with tracks like \\"Everyone Says Hi,\\" and the gut-wrenching existentialism of \\"Quicksand\\" permeating Slip Away, Slow Burn, Heathen and Sunday.   Slip Away is a standout track, on the surface appearing like a simple comic book parody of characters from the US based Uncle Floyd show, the narrative soon reveals heartfelt emotions of the bittersweet loss, separation and introspection associated with the deterioration of relationships. Bowie even brings out the old stylophone for the final few bars.    If there is one album that defines Bowie's career this is probably it. Awe-inspiring.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I'm a death/black metal fan through and through.  But I got to tell you, I love Marilyn Manson, as well, and he is one of the few industrial bands that I care to listen to (the other two being Nine Inch Nails, of course, and Rammstein) I got Antichrist after I had already owned Holywood for about a year, and while Antichrist is maybe not as rock and roll heavy as Holywood was, it is far darker and more disturbed/disturbing and in my opinion a far better album.  Gothic and depressing, the music is all perfectly constructed (thanks in no small part to Trent Reznor's briliance) and the lyrics are all thought-provoking and deep.  Stand-out tracks include Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Tourniquet, Cryptorchid, Antichrist Superstar, and Man that you Fear.  Buy it if you're into metal, or want to own a great piece of 90's American industrial.  I would also recommend buying NIN's Downward Spiral and MM's Holywood.  Great albums that compliment each other.
0316172324|5.0|Well, I thought that after that high-falutin book about butterflys and subways and what-not I'd be in for another sleeper, but this book is zen gold!  My girlfriend always complains to my dad, sayin, \\"uncle, that boy of yours just dont THINK!\\"  <br /> <br />Well missy, guess whos got the experts behind them now!
B0000029GA|5.0|First of all, all of the wise sages of hip hop history know that this album is the greatest rap album of all time. Every naive soul who gives this classic opus less than 5 stars is clearly a 2pac groupie who probably listens to rap out of his or her daddy's BMW in the suburbs. True hip hop scholars realize that \\"Illmatic\\" is 10 times better than any trash that 2pac produced. Nas is a street poet, while Pac was a studio gangsta-rent-a-thug clown who had no true wisdom. Go spend the money and buy this album!
B0007TKH66|4.0|I've read the reviews (most of them anyway) and from what everyone has said, I can tell you this:  Star Trek Enterprise is the best installment in the Star Trek Universe, or the biggest piece of crap that has ever sucked up people's free time. <br /> <br />I watched most of the first season before giveing that up to wait for the DVD sets.  It was too hard to try and find when it was going to be on every week.  Networks need to take note of that. <br /> <br />But anyway, I enjoyed the show quite a bit.  I hadn't really developed too much of a connection to all the characters yet, but they seemed pretty good.  My only complaints would be that Cpt. Archer was a bit wishy washy.  Of course, when you're used to people like James T. Kirk, and Jean Luc Picard, you are looking for someone who will be ready at the drop of a hat to put their foot down.  Hmmm, maybe they wanted to try something different...  Can they do that? <br /> <br />The Vulcan girl.  Yeah, she was a bit strange, and probably way too hot.  I can say that she had the ability to keep my eyes on the screen.  Her looks are used very liberally, like when her and a few other cast members way early in the series (maybe it was in the pilot) have to disinfect themselves, by rubbing a clear lotion all over their finely tuned starfleet bodies.  I liked it, but I sat there feeling that I shouldn't.  Make your own call. <br /> <br />Time travel.  Urk, it's nice that they wanted to tackle some nice time travel stories, but I think that there was a lot of overkill in that area. <br /> <br />The last little complaint is the poor continuity.  I understand that basing a show in the past of timelines that we already are very familiar with is rough, but they did choose to do it.  Hows about taking some time to do it right? <br /> <br />Anyway, I think that it's pretty good sci-fi and fairly good ST, so if you like any of those things, you might want to give it a try.  If you can afford it, that is.
0684800713|5.0|Ernest Hemingway wrote in short declarative sentences putting as much stock in what he didn't say as what he did.  The Sun Also Rises is the quitessential Imagist novel.  Hemingway gives you an image and leaves you to develop it in your mind.  Anyone could read and enjoy a Hemingway novel, because on the surface, simplicity reigns.  It is an easy read.  But beneath the surface is where the depth of character and meaning reside making Hemingway that rarest of breeds, the writer both accessible to the common reader and challenging to the reader looking for something more.   <br />All of that said what drives this wonderful novel is great characters.  They are not great in the sense that they are outstanding people.  They are great in the sense that they are wonderfully developed and wholly believable.  Robert Cohn is perhaps the most annoying invention this side of Fran Drescher, but his character rings true, and while we hold contempt for him, we also pity him.   <br />The story is about a man, Jake, who lives in paris after the first world war, and works as a journalist for a foreign paper.  Jake is in love with Brett, but due to an unspecified war injury, he is unable to consummate the relationship.  Robert Cohn is Jakes clingy friend who takes an instant liking to Brett, and has no such shortcomings as Jake.  He does however, manage to alienate Brett because she never loved him.  He also alienates Jake, because of the love Jake holds for Brett.  He alienates Brett's soon to be husband as well, and Jake's true friend Bill Gordon.  All of this happens during the vivid description of a fishing trip in which Hemingway equates nature with God, as the stream Jake fishes in is more akin to church than church, to a bullfight festival that is a lively and vibrant as if it were happening right in front of you.  To tell too much of the story would be to give away what is one of the five greatest American novels ever written, so I won't. But this a must read for anyone who can read in the English language.  This is the masterwork of one of our country's greatest writers.
B0000C8AVM|1.0|This album is not good at all. Bob Dylan's voice is terrible, he can not sing. I really do not understand the big deal with Bob Dylan. I have listened to this Bob Dylan album and a few others, and I just can not stand it. The music is very boring and he can not sing. For those of you who enjoy folk music sung by a guy with a very winny voice, this may be an album for you. This album gives me a head ache, it really does. If you want real music, with people who can sing the songs they write, listen to The Beatles, The Rolling Stoness, Pink Floyd, I could go on and on naming better music than this. Roger Waters is a more than excellent songwriter, and hey, guess what, he can sing the songs he writes, and not just sing them, sing them well. \\"Greatest Album Ever\\", PLEASE! give me a break, those who say that need to broden their listening. There is better music out there people, you do have the ability to find it. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is the greatest album ever, by the greatest band ever, and everone should know that.  <br /> <br />Sure, whatever, the songs that Bob Dylan writes are good, if you look at the lyrics page, but music is about more than that... ITS ABOUT THE MUSIC. Bob Dyaln should have sold his songs to someone who could actually sing them, that would have been a lot better. Its one thing to be a songwwriter, and its a whole other thing to be a singer, well a good singer anyway.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Half the reason i like progressive rock is because it stays out of the mainstream. It doesnt change to fit the mainstream. But recently new prog has become tired and boring. I can't think of many good prog cds that have come out in the last couple years. Crap like \\"Octane\\" by Spock's Beard and \\"Adam and Eve\\" by the flower kings... wow, those cds suck. Sometimes, a genre HAS to change to fit the mainstream a little, or it will die.  <br /> <br />At The Drive In was a wonderful punk band. In/Casino/Out is a beautiful cd. When the band split up, i wasnt sure what to think. Deloused, this bands other album, is okay, but i dont like the band Sparta at all. But on this CD, The Mars Volta takes their prog talents and uses them to their fullest, to create, somehow, a top ten selling prog-funk masterpiece. <br /> <br />From the haunting accoustic guitar opening to \\"Cygnus... Vismond Cygnus\\" to the deranged riff that follows it, you can already tell this cd will rule. The music goes all over the place. There are ambient parts, some of which are better than others. The most ambient stuff would be in the song \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore,\\" which i think is amazing. the first half of it is practically inaudable, but its kinda pretty. it goes into a truely haunting part with vocals, one of the highlights of the album i think, and is followed by an ambient guest trumpet solo played by Flea. Wierd! The outro to the first song is ambient, and its cool but far too long. Parts of the last song have ambient free-jazzy parts which are really amazing. Then some of it is just crazy. listen to almost all of the first track, or part one of the last song. It's insane. Yet each time you listen to it, it starts to make more sense, until it doesnt seem that bizzare anymore. Its a cd that takes many listens, but its worth each one. Track 3 is like a spanish rock song with John Frusciante on it, which is cool. This song is awesome but not my favorite. \\"The Widow\\" is the single andits very pretty, though the ending is too long. I actually prefer the radio edit. <br /> <br />Lyrically this album is very interesting. I'll let you figure out the concept for yourself (partly because I CANT) but it is based on a diary the band found in a limo, that one of the members of the band (i think) who died recently found that this diary related a lot to his own life. I find that a very interesting, almost haunting concept. The lyrics often dont make sense, but in a fun way. <br /> <br />The album plays well as a whole. Its got a constant loud/soft dynamic going from song to song, and it makes the album really cool to listen to all at once. unlike their other album, the songs dont really medley together. each song is very definately its own song. There are only a couple repeating themes but it doesnt really need any. this album is totally unique, yet somehow its been selling well. Its so good that ANYONE can appreciate it, not just the prog-snobs that like new prog crap simply because they feel they have to. Its a cd that takes time and a high IQ, but the fact is its brilliant. It will blow your mind. It will change your life. <br /> <br />I'm seeing this band live in may, and i honestly can say i am so excited i can hardly contain myself.
B000000H57|5.0|This is the one album I've listened to most out of any other. The album starts out with 38 second track of a 60 hertz hum which then leads into a little introduction from the band laughing about the little joke. Personally I think they should have kept these two tracks off the album. The third track \\"Love You to Death\\" is amazing. The vocal melodies and guitars work together perfectly. Later on in the album, they do a cover of Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl\\". They did a great job keeping the feeling of the Neil Young version, yet giving it a whole new sound you'll enjoy. Still after 8 years of listening to this album, I still hear things that I've never noticed. I heard something about the band using 40 or more recording tracks for some of the songs in the studio. You can hear it too; you hear layers and layers of orchestras, pianos, sound effects, and everything you can think of. They all work together perfectly too. The production behind it is amazing.  I have yet to hear an album that even comes close to it. Buy this album, it's different in a good way. Nothing else sounds anything like it.
B00005T30L|3.0|A well-received film in which two cynical teenagers, having just graduated from high school, spend a summer casting sarcasm and disdain over the superficiality and expectations of them. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who make fun of things, play pranks and approach everything with a condescending eye. Having planned to move into an apartment together, their plans immediately face obstacles. Rebecca gets a job and starts to conform to a lifestyle Enid wants no part of. Rebecca matures and sees the reality of needing money to live independently, while Enid wants to linger in this adolescent-aimless-loser phase (ruining all her job possibilities almost as soon as they start). One of her pranks leads her to meet Seymour (Steve Buscemi) a middle-aged loser of sorts whose one passion in life is collecting rare records. Perhaps because they each personify the loner-loser stereotype so well, Enid and Seymour are drawn together. Other reviewers have quite thoroughly covered Enid's attitude, her wasted intelligence and self-destructive nature, and certainly provide a glowing recommendation for this film, which my review only supports.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" instantly rose to my top 10 all time favorite movies.    I don't recall the last time I was so captivated by a movie as I was when watching this one.  There have been many films which attempts to capture the world of children as seen by adults, and most come off a bit sappy and overly nostalgic.  This one is perfect.    Johnny Depp, as he so often is, was masterful in his role as the shy, introverted, imaginative, and playful playwright J. M. Barrie.   Kate Winslet was bold and provocative as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the mother of the boys who provided the inspiration for  Barrie's play Peter Pan.    But, in all honesty, I think top honors should go to Freddie Highmore,  Joe Prospero,  Nick Roud, and  Luke Spill, the boys who played Peter, Jack, George, and Michael Davies.  Freddie Highmore played Peter (not Peter Pan, but the real Peter) and I would have to say that he nearly stole the show.  For a child actor his performance was moving, vivid, and strikingly real. (He also has the lead child role in the upcoming Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, again plating with Depp.  Johnny was so impressed with Highmore performance's in Neverland that he insisted he be given the lead child role in Chocolate Factory as well.)    The story is told through the eyes of Barrie as he befriends the young Davies boys, and despite the social objections which flutter around them, becomes their adopted uncle and spends his afternoons and evenings playing cowboys, pirates, kings, etc.    These scenes of playful imagination are filmed in such as way that we are fully engulfed in their world of make believe, with occasional flashes back to reality to remind us that it is only pretend.  The flashes back and forth between imagination and reality are handled with just the right touch of reserve and taste.      I can't emphasize enough how touching and magical this movie is.  It's an innocent and sweet look into the lives of three people:  One is an a creative and simple man caught between his desire to still be a kid and the world of adults in which he lives, one is lonely and stressed widow trying to raise four boys on her own, and the third is a scared little boy who's grieving for his father's death and must learn how to become a child again.    I absolutely promise you will love ever second of it.  If not, email me and I'll refund you for the cost of the rental :-)    Enjoy!
B00004TWZF|3.0|For many people, this is a beautiful, inspiring film-a favorite in fact-but I have never really felt so drawn to this film. It has attained a kind of cult status, but I don't think it is because the story itself is so compelling. It is beautiful, particularly in cinematographic terms, but for example, the presence of Rosanna Arquette is several strikes against the film right off the bat. She alone can almost ruin the film, and she very nearly does. The cinematography is stunning and the lifelong competition between two very different men (Jean Reno and Jean-Marc Barr) with very similar purposes is fascinating to watch. Jean-Marc Barr portrays Jacques, a very sensitive young man with a deep connection to the sea; Jean Reno is more extravagant as Enzo, a more boisterous sort. Be sure to watch the director's cut; not the American cut up version. The added footage makes a more reflective film, even if not deeply \\"action packed\\".
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Not as good as their self titled debut or Songs For the Deaf but better than Rated R, Josh Hommes new modified Queens album tries it out without the dynamic of Nick Oliveri. The resulting product is still, nonetheless, a better-than-average, powerful rock endeavour, pushing the envelope like no one else out there. Josh Homme, while belting out some killer, break neck riffs, engineers some pretty memorable melodies ready for rock radio if radio rock meant anything anymore. Standout tracks include the flawless and driving \\"In My Head\\" and the lovely, epic \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" a desert highway ballad that brings U2 into stonerrock. Not great but get's 4 stars just for being there amid the rest of the rubbish lately.
B00005JNEI|4.0|How, with all of this clear evidence against him, was George W. Bush re-elected? A well-done indictment of the behind-the-scenes workings and connections of the Bush family and bin Ladens and how Bush's decisions warrant more in-depth examination. However one feels about Michael Moore's in-your-face, unrelenting style, or his facts/research (he was armed to the teeth with researchers and backed up facts this time), the key point of Moore's work (here and in his other films and books) is that he presents his take on issues but does not ask or want viewers/readers to take him at face value. His work is about challenging people NOT TO ACCEPT what they are fed or told-- but to question, dig and find out their own answers. Isn't that, after all, what it means to be American?
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Sod off with your radiohead comparisons yanks, we got over that back in 2001...but thats probably because you havent had Origin Of Symmetry released over there and half of you condescending gits havent even listened deeper or seen them live...so up yours...
0385510454|5.0|This was a great read. I think the spy satelite story is a fascinating subject.  <br /> <br />Grisham did a wonderful job with the setting too, I savored every meal, the food, the wine and the cappuccinos right along with Joel Backman. <br /> <br />It's a fine story, with some lite romance, and Joel Backman sort of redeems himself--makes a new life. It was well done and I found the ending was very satisfying.
B000002KDS|5.0|To me, this was the original band's finest moment. From the classic rock opening riff of Under My Wheels to the freaked out psychoatic white nosie the album  closes with (which scared the crap out of me the first time I heard it), this was Coop's most uniformly satisfying album. Be My Lover has one of the greatest bridge riffs I've ever heard (the guitar part right after Alice sings I'm still on my own), it still gives me goosebumps it is so great. Halo of Flies, Desperado, and Dead Babies/Killer are mini sagas within themselves, Killer's music especially sounding like it could have been the soundtrack to an old mystery or spy movie. But my favorite song on the album has to be You Drive Me Nervous. I love the cymbal sound Neil Smith has throughout the song (almost identical to Ian Paice's sound at the very end of Smoke of the Water, but Neil got it out there first!!) and Michael Bruce and Glen Buxton's guitar interplay. Those guys were both so underrated as guitarists it's a crime. Just a fabulous song all around, not that there is a weak track on this album. The only thing I question on the whole album is why did they put horns on the last chrous of Under My Wheels? It takes away from the band.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone have a unique ability to blend the nuanced with the obvious, to mix cerebral humor with cheap sight gags and fart jokes.  If this appeals to you (watch an episode of \\"South Park\\" if you are unsure), and you don't mind having your sacred cows slaughtered and made into taco fillings, this film is a must-see --for repeated viewings.<br /><br />Mad dictator Kim Jong Il plans to subvert Hollywood and become the megaproliferant of the stars.  Who can stop him? Only Team America, a gang of ultra-right wing marionettes who think Rush Limbaugh is suspiciously liberal.  But don't fret, conservatives: Hollywood pinkos and Michael Moore take a beating, too.  Nothing is sacred to Parker and Stone.<br /><br />Puppets were a mad choice for a medium, but they are done hysterically.  I don't know what had me laughing more, the whiskey glass soldered to the team leader's hand, or the thought of the splinters and friction fire from marionette sex!<br /><br />The sound track alone makes this film worth it.  \\"Freedom isn't Free\\" could have been a real country hit and Kim singing \\"I'm so ronery\\" had my wife blowing her cola out her nose in the theater!<br /><br />If you are straight-laced, have a poor sense of humor and can't admit it, or can't laugh at yourself, this may not be you're film.  If you've got a slightly warped sense of humor, you'll love this!
B0002858YS|4.0|When my brother dropped this CD in my player last January as a birthday present, I was a bit hesitant.  After all, this was the guy who had recommended Moon Martin to me in the past.  But boy was I surprised at what I heard.  The Killers sound like a modern rock band from the 80's with a hard edge from the 90's thrown in.  I love the synths and the guitars, and when you mix the tracks from \\"Hot Fuss\\" up with tracks from Interpol's \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" they are sometimes indistinguishable from each other.  It's a great modern rock sound for the 00's, the highlights being the first 4 tracks (especially \\"Smile Like You Mean it\\") and the great techno mix of \\"Somebody Told Me\\" available as a single.  I will be doing more exploring into the Killers.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|\\"Without doubt, one of the most hysterical parodies ever!\\" <br /> <br />Given the current world political climate, Trey Parker and Matt Stone hit the ball right out of the park with this film.  I haven't laughed so hard so frequently in a theater in years!  This was simply amazing. <br /> <br />The sheer goofy look and movement of the deliberately low-tech puppet bodies, combined with their high-tech heads and incredibly elaborate sets, makes for some truly classic moments.  When the World Police thoughtfully swoop down to take out a handful of terrorist, while simultaneously destroying much of the surrounding city in the process, you can't help but laugh at the irony.  Can you say \\"collateral damage\\"? <br /> <br />And the overly extended scene of the two lead puppets engaging in the obligatory sex scene had me laughing so uncontrollably that I thought they'd have to take me out of the theater on a stretcher.  Oh my Lord was that funny.  It was one of those rare movie moment that had me laughing days later just thinking about it. <br /> <br />Not only do Parker and Stone mercilessly poke fun at the silly, over-the-top nature of certain Hollywood filmmakers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay (e.g., his nearly unwatchable \\"Pearl Harbor\\"), but they also take the public personas of world leaders like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and practically feed them into a wood chipper. How this film didn't spark an international PR incident with North Korea is just astounding to me. <br /> <br />What makes their political edge so refreshing and sidesplitting is they're willingness to take on everybody, rather than merely bolstering a right- or left-wing view.  And the merciless way they go after Hollywood celeb-activists was profoundly funny.  Too often I've been sickened by the overly simplistic mentality that comes from the mouths of certain actors when they use their status as public figures to comment on the world affairs.  Parker and Stone portray acting notables like Penn, Baldwin, Robbins, Sarandon, and Garofalo as complete idiots, who are as easily herded about by Kim Jong-Il as so many sheep.  Matt Damon is practically a troglodyte who is so stupid that all his brain can manage is to say his name over and over again. <br /> <br />Like \\"South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut,\\" this film has numerous musical numbers that are used to punctuate the humor of various scenes.  The song \\"America, F**k Yeah!\\" once again practically had me on the floor, especially when it was uses a second time but with a much slower beat. The level of adult humor and vulgarity here will probably not make this film suitable for small kids, and much of the political edginess may be lost on most teenagers.  But if there were a category for \\"Best Comedy Film,\\" Parker and Stone would both win an Oscars, hands down!
B000003489|5.0|I'd say this recording is within the top ten most essential, influential, brilliant, and groovin' albums recorded by John Coltrane from 1956-1967.  <br /> <br />This was the first album with all Trane originals on it. Trane had a couple gems before this like, Coltrane, Soultrane, and Mating Call, but this was truely a masterpiece. The only other Trane album before it that I would compare would have to be Blue Train. This was only the start for Coltrane's musical exploration. The albums and the music only got better from here on out.  <br /> <br />Coltrane hadn't really crossed into the avant garde scene yet; this album is fairly straight ahead. He was currently with Miles Davis, and recorded the influential, Kind Of Blue around the same time as this recording. <br /> <br />He was truely at the top of his game. His horn playing only got better, and he let his ideas pure out of him, in excellent compositions, all demonstrated here. <br /> <br />The title track, Giant Steps is fiercly played, with energy, by Trane, and Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. (other musicians who were at the session include, Cedar Walton, piano, Jimmy Cobb, drums, and Lex Humphries, on drums, also.) The tune got its name because the jumps from note to note were rather big, so naturally it became \\"Giant Steps.\\" Some of the most brilliant improvising is shown in this tune. <br /> <br />The bluesy Cousin Mary swings so violently. My personal favorite track here is Syeeda's Song Flute. Mr P.C. comes in at a close second.  <br /> <br />The fireous, Countdown, with excellent drumming by Art Taylor is improvisational work at its best. It perhaps foreshadows some of Trane's later avant garde playing. <br /> <br />The ballad here is Naima, written for his wife at the time. For this tune, Art Taylor sits out and Jimmy Cobb, (who also was working with Miles at this time) gets the throne.  <br /> <br />There are a whole bunch of bonus tracks, which make this reissue clock in at over an hour. Drummer Lex Humphries, perhaps best known for being a part of the early Jazztet, gets the throne on all the bonus tracks.  <br /> <br />This album is without a doubt, a masterpiece. 40 years later, it's still as fresh to this day, as it was in 1959. Coltrane and Giant Steps live on!

078322947X|5.0|REVISED FOR THE BLU-RAY RELEASE AND INFORMATION ON THE DVD REISSUE AS WELL.<br /><br />William Friedkin's remake of \\"The Wages of Fear\\" brought a more contemporary, edgy slant to a classic French film. The scale is bigger but the plot remains the same; Roy Scheider plays Jackie Scanlan a member of a crew who accepts what appears to be a suicidal mission; transport nitroglycerin across the treacherous landscape of South America to put out a massive oil fire. All four members of the driving crew have shady pasts making this an ideal chance to escape from the events haunting them at home.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this is a five star movie and superior to the film that inspired Friedkin to make this.<br /><br />The remastered, restored blu-ray release of this classic film looks terrific--colors pop and depth is exceptionally good even considering that this is on a single layer blu-ray disc.<br /><br />The new remastered widescreen DVD uses the same new transfer supervised by the director.<br /><br />The 5.1 HD master audio sounds marvelous adding to the suspense of a terrific film.<br /><br />The blu-ray, beyond the booklet included as part of the package (this may receive a regular blu release later in a standard keep case as is often the case with these Warner book-style releases)is truly the only \\"extra\\" included here which is unfortunate--a commentary track by Friedkin would be welcome discussing the difficult making of the film. I'm not sure if a vintage featurette (these often appeared on TV to promote films)exists for the film or not but if it did it would be nice to include that as well.<br /><br />Still, the booklet is very good with Friedkin discussing the making of the film and plenty of photos. I'm sure that the booklet is excerpted from Friedkin's new memior The Friedkin Connection which is (curiously) adverised on the back of the hardbound book that houses the blu-ray.<br /><br />Friedkin's vision and the shooting ran out of control contributing to the unforgettable atmosphere of tension that lingers in the finished film. During shooting Friedkin routinely fired crew members forcing the production company to fly them out of the remote location jungle in the Dominican Republic adding to the film's budget. The replacement members had to be flown in as well. Tensions ran high and tempers flared due to illness, production screw ups and the location which, ironically, created a sense of claustrophobia and isolation. While many prefer the original classic French film, Friedkin's remake creates its own unique signature with the outrageous stunts and dangerous conditions that dogged the crew at every turn.<br /><br />Nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound, \\"Sorcerer\\" remains a taunt, flawed classic that sound be seen. It stands apart from its source film and on its own. While I love \\"The Wages of Fear\\", Friedkin's film captured my imagination when I first saw it in theaters.

0525457585|5.0|Andrew Tully <br />        Hour 1 <br />        March 21, 2005 <br />        Book Review <br /> <br />Neverending?  Unfortunately not. <br /> <br />  Not a very likely first statement for a standard book of fantasy.  But, then again The Neverending Story, ironically, written by Michael Ende, isn't a standard tale.  This story is written in third person, something not unusual for a fantasy story, the single twist is this, the reader knows the \\"All Knowing Being\\" is a boy of twelve who is reading along with you.  Both the narrator and the boy whose story he's reading are very believable, and yet maintain a set of demigod-ish attributes.   The plot is basic; an unlikely hero needs to save the princess and the world, named Fantastica, while undergoing innumerable and unimaginable trials, and the aid of mythical characters such as nymphs, dwarves, rock giants, luckdragons, and the occasional will-o-the-wisp.  Just as the story seems to end, the young boy reading with you is sucked into the book!  Whoa...I didn't see that coming. <br /> I won't ruin any other twists in the story, but that doesn't mean that by any stretch of the imagination this book is boring.  In fact, I would say The Neverending Story is one of the best books I have ever read, and from a guy who's read everything from Shakespeare to Douglas Adams, I have a pretty well versed portfolio of things to compare with.  The reasons this book was so appealing are simple.  The language was simple, and yet wound together in a fashion that makes the description fluent and eloquent, and so events are intertwined by detail that seems fine-tuned.  Transitions from the real world to the world of Fantastica are clean, yet they are made clear by the use of Italics for the real world script and regular text for the interactions in Fantastica.   <br /> But, can one have a well-versed fiction book with just description and fancy language?  No, there must be a moral.  Ende's moral is simple: be true to yourself.  Both main characters in The Neverending Story experience trials that test their innermost beliefs about themselves.  If either boy should fail to recognize the importance of their own self-confidence, that consequences will be even worse than death.  A very appropriate theme written by someone raised in one of the most highly political time the world has ever seen.  Michael Ende was born in Germany in 1929.  He was raised by his parents, and when he was old enough, he entered into the Waldorf School.  He attended for two years, but was forced to quit when the German Army drafted him.  After World War 2, Ende held various jobs in the arts until in 1960; he published his first book, Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver.   <br /> Well, I personally enjoyed this book, and most others who read it agreed.  Reading Matters, a UK based book reviewing site says: \\"If you enjoy fantasy and roaming round totally new worlds populated by the outlandish and bizarre, then I'm sure you will enjoy this book!\\"  I would recommend this book for all people who love fantasy.  It is filled with all the best aspects of the genre, and it holds a few surprises that make it worth the read.
0975991477|5.0|This information is powerful and the book is pure delight to read! In a clear, easy-to-follow and elegant way, Dr. Bruce Lipton explains the new field of biology that is unraveling the mysteries of how our perceptions of our environment influence the behavior of our cells. The book explodes the myth that our genes are beyond our control. When we recognize how positive and negative beliefs control our biology we can use this knowledge to create lives filled with health and happiness. This is the science book everyone should have who wants a good foundation for understanding how the cells of our body are affected by our thoughts and perceptions. I was blown away by the fact that `genes cannot turn themselves on or off' and that `something in the environment has to trigger gene activity.' I especially enjoyed the chapter on the origins of self-sabotaging subconscious programming and his supportive evidence that we can rewrite our old, outdated programs with ones that we choose ourselves. I loved this book and highly recommend it in the workshops and classes I teach, as it is a perfect complement to my work. He even states, `In the end, these cellular insights serve to emphasize the wisdom of spiritual teachers throughout the ages.\\" Dr. Bruce Lipton helps us gain insights that better equip us to take charge of our lives.

B000002UA2|1.0|I wouldn't waste much time on this. It can't compare at all with Dark Side of the Moon; it's hard to believe the band that wrote and performed Dark Side is the same band on this album. The only thing interesting about this album is how it may add evidence to the theory of a meaningful connection between Dark Side and the movie \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  The band had an opportunity to put music to a movie shortly before making Dark Side.  Anyway, Obscured by Clouds is the only Pink Floyd album I have that I doubt I'll ever listen to again.
0399230033|5.0|Given that I'm not a fan of gorillas/monkeys/chimps, I was not expecting to like this book at all when we got it as a baby gift--but I love it!  I love the colors, I love the characters, and I love the silliness of the story!  The little mouse is great; even the gorilla is cute!  It's great to see so many kinds of animals sharing an adventure together.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|i found that this movies story was a little week and the acting needed improvment. but the comedy was crazy!! it it left my mom in stiches for the next week! if ur gonna watch this movie then u better not be a guy who looks for the plots or anything cuz u won't find one, just laughs......
6301966562|5.0|This is one of those movies that MUST be in my collection.  Why can't I get this?  I have a list of great movies that I bought on VHS and have been trying to find on DVD.  Somebody has to get their feces together and make this available.

B00025ETIW|5.0|After a pretty good debut album, MCR has managed to work out some of the kinks and put out a killer album here. Its well produced, there's a lot of variety in the songs, and they manage to leave you with many hooks without selling out. Popular songs like \\"Helena\\" and \\"I'm not okay\\" are great, but this album's highlights lie in songs that don't make the airwaves, like \\"You Know What They do to Guys Like Us in Prison\\" and \\"Ghost of You\\". A couple months after buying this CD, it still makes its way into my car's CD player on a regular basis.
B000002JS6|5.0|Legendary is the only way to discribe this album!The AC/DC comeback album after the Death of Bon.This is simply a MUST HAVE for any and ALL AC/DC fans!The best song is the title track BACK IN BLACK.This is one of thoses songs that you like the second you here it!(Then again,thats how the whole album is!!)There is not one thing wrong with this album.So,yes if you are an AC/DC fan(hardcore or not)this is for you!!!!!!!!!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut released February 10, 1978 was also, appropriatly enough, my introduction to this band some years later when I recieved the cassette as a Christmas present; and what a great place to start! Not only was it my introduction to Van Halen, it was also my introduction to heavy rock, and I remember as a 12 year old kid being blown away by the heavy riffing, and incendiary guitar work of Eddie Van Halen, the likes of which I had never heard in my life! David Lee Roth's distinctive voice seems to compliment this fun-loving style of hard rock very well, although he is really at his best in a live situation. Eddie's groundbreaking solo \\"Eruption\\" marked an important turning point in the history of rock music and guitar-playing, and even all these years later if you dont find this impressive, you're probably on smack.  <br /> <br />This album is classic, party-hard rock, and I dare you to give it a spin and not feel good! And in my opinion, this is Van Halens best.  <br /> <br />(Okay, I know this is maybe a cheap shot, but I couldnt resist. An anagram describing tupac wayne gacy's reiew: SOCKBOLL!) :P

0441172717|5.0|I believe Dune is a remarkable and well-done book, solid sci-fi that hasn't worn out over the years. Frank Herbert's writing creates the idea and understanding of an entire galaxy one planet at a time. The plot is most certainly unique; I have rarely seen a science fiction novel about oversized worms, especially when the book is serious about them. <br /> <br />   The first book, of course, is best accompanied by the others. In Frank Herbert's writing style, he gives readers of the books knowledge only right when it makes a difference, which leaves many things less than full explained after this book. Even after reading Chapterhouse: Dune, there is still much more to know. <br /> <br />   Back to the book at hand. The novel is about one, small, almost uninhabitable planet. The irony is that this one planet is the place where a drug that the whole Universe needs is. The majority of the series is about how strange things and power struggles can be made around one small planet, and how the entire population of the Known Universe responds when it is...Ooh, but I'm giving it away. Read the book, it's the best science-fiction there is. <br />

I guess it would not be so frustrating if they hadn't of done such a good job with widow. But the rest of the cd is horrible.I dont understand how people can classify this as music when im sitting here, listening to over 4 minutes of erie tones. I think it would be wiser, less costly, and just as \\"intriguing\\" to buy the song on iTunes, and go buy a halloween cd with the erie tones on it. Overall, i just wish i could get my damn money back! <br /> <br />My Grade <br />F
B00079018K|5.0|For those of you having a problem ripping this CD, go to the Apple website and download iTunes.  iTunes bypasses the copy protection on this CD and rips mp3s perfectly at any bitrate.  As far as the program pop-up that comes up when you load the CD, just hold down your Shift key when you load the disc and wait a few seconds.  That will keep the CD's autorun from executing (if you can't stop the program popup, you can still run iTunes behind it.)  <br /> <br />Ignoring the annoying copy protection, this CD is easily an early frontrunner for best disc of 2005.  Highlights are L.S.F., Cutt Off, and Butcher Blues.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the only album that just won't get old. I bought \\"OK Computer\\" when I was 13 years old. I had seen music videos of \\"paranoid android\\" and \\"karma police\\" being over played on MTV at the time and trying to remember the last music video that I didn't mind watching every other minute. I couldn't and with the kind of music MTV plays now, I wish they could go back in time. Now I'm 21 and still an avid listener of Radiohead and yes, \\"OK Computer\\". There's no doubt about it that Radiohead's albums preceeding \\"OK Compuer\\" were more than just OK, they were great but \\"OK\\" is obviously hands down the band's masterpiece.  <br />This album continues to get air time from me in my car and at home. It is the only album that I truely love, love love. Every song is so lush and filled with complexities. It's a joy everytime to listen to. Many have said that the band and this particular album are overrated. How can this be when there are listeners reviewing this album genuinly and truthfully? I love Radiohead's work because every piece is significant. I don't even have a favorite song because I love them all.  <br />They're emotional, dark yet hopeful, epic, lyrical, and perfect. \\"Let Down\\" and \\"No Surprises\\" can still manage to get me teary-eyed. I don't know how they do it but I thank them. \\"OK Computer\\" was simply ahead of it's time. For being 8 years old, it still proves to be as fresh and alive as their latest efforts. It's a classic with a lot of hype. Only this time they're right.
B00000JG41|5.0|Mr. Bungle's California is perhaps the greatest musical mindf--k of all time.<br /><br />Why is that? It certainly isn't as *overtly* weird, noisy, or crazy as the previous two Mr. Bungle releases, let alone even more deranged avant-garde collectives such as John Zorn's Naked City, The Boredoms, or even Patton's own Fantomas.<br /><br />No, this album could be described as accessible, even mellow at times. This is Mr. Bungle?<br /><br />Indeed it is. Whereas previous albums wore their psychosis on their sleeves with lots of random genre-hopping schizophrenia, the genius of Mr. Bungle's third (and sadly final) release lies in its rather Lynch-esque demeanor; some fairly messed-up stuff lies underneath the glossy pop exterior. Consider the opening number, Sweet Charity. You've got a nice toe-tapping tropical melody, Beach Boys-esque harmonies, and Mike Patton toning down his usual vocal anarchy in favor of sweet crooning. But the sound is... off, perceptibly minor-key and dark. This ain't Brian Wilson. And once the lyrics start evoking imagery of \\"bombs and scarecrows singing\\"... uh-huh. Pure Patton all the way.<br /><br />The insanity continues unabated in the more frantic None Of Them Knew They Were Robots, which takes swing and bends it into something truly frightening, and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare effortlessly parodies '50s surf pop and adds its own dark spin on things. The old Bungle muse is resurrected briefly with Ars Moriendi, which can only be described as \\"Gypsy-polka-techno-thrash\\" (!). Then there's a weird \\"New Age/inspirational\\" piece (The Holy Filament); a funky and bleepy-bloopy videogame/musicbox ditty (Golem 2..); a deliciously cheesy '50s lounge-lizard spoof complete with hilariously overwrought backing vocals (Pink Cigarette); and a seemingly innocent do-wop parody with lyrics that'll have you doing a double take (Vanity Fair).<br /><br />It all finishes with the crowning moment of madness, Goodbye Sober Day. Throw together bits of lounge, bossanova, electronica, Gregorian chants, thrash, and Patton's own take on the Balinese Monkey Chant (!!!) and let 'er rip. Music like this is the reason why I am a total Patton sycophant. Trey Spruance, Trevor Dunn, and others do a top-notch job backing Mike, as always.<br /><br />Anyway, if you love music that's slightly cracked; your favorite Zappa album was Cruising With Ruben & The Jets; or if you simply dig talented chops with a deranged sense of humor and hummable melodies, add California to your collection post-haste.s, thrash, and Patton's own take on the Balinese Monkey Chant (!!!) and let 'er rip.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie. It is completely original and absolutely stunning. I loved every minute of this film. This movie really really gets you to think. And, in the end, everything begins to fall into place. I was left stunned and shocked by how everything turned out. I took absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in picking this movie up to own. I definetely recommend that everyone at least give this movie a view once. I can gurantee all of you that you will find something that you will enjoy in this movie. Don't hesitate. Experience Donnie Darko today!
6302636779|5.0|Hands down, this was Audrey's best performance in my view. It was stunning. Hepburn put so much into the role. I am Roman Catholic and in 1959 the film was on the banned listed for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, and I did not get to view it until well into my 30's. Prior to then I had become a Audrey Hepburn fan when my parents took me to Radio City to see \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and \\"Charade.\\" Beyond then I viewed \\"The Children's Hour\\" in which she gave an excellent performance, but this is her best performance ever. I understand there were some variations from the book. In reality Gabrielle's Dad did not allow her to marry because her fiance's Mother had been in an insane asylum and he was too concerned she would conceive children who were mentally ill. Someday perhaps I will read the book, but for now, I always enjoy the film and will always enjoy Hepburn's performance.
B000059XUO|5.0|I remember the very first time I had watched this movie back in December of 2003. It was about a week before XMas and this show came on one of the movie channels. I had heard lots about the movie and I decided to give it a try. I was taken in by the beauty that this film creates. It presents such a well written and original story line. The acting is absolutely superb.<br /><br />After watching it, I ran to my parents and told them they must buy this movie for me for XMas. Thankfully, they did. The special features are also incredible on this film. They give you a real indepth look at the making of the movie and will satisfy any fan of \\"special features in movies.<br /><br /> This is one of me and my girlfriends favorite movies. I have gotten her a ring set from this movie, which the ring reads \\"Real Love Is Forever\\" (one of my favorite quotes from the movie. She has also purchased me some gifts from this movie including a Crow zip up sweater which her parents had purchased for me for XMas in 2004.<br /><br />I have shown this film to many of my friends and they all loved it. I will give my gurantee that you will watch this movie and enjoy it just as much as I have the very first time I watched it. This feeling will come back to you each and everytime you watch this marvelous film.

0064407667|3.0|Despite all the hype I've been hearing during the last few years over the Series of Unfortunate Events books, I just finally read the first one.  I didn't particularly care for the writing style; in fact, I found it rather annoying.  But the story was so captivating that I couldn't put the book down.  I read it in one sitting...I guess it's partly our morbid curiosity that has made these books so popular. All in all, a good story by a not so good writer. I will probably read the other books in the series just because I'm curious about what happens to these poor, unfortunate children.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals (1977.), Pink Floyd's tenth studio album<br /><br />So I'm sitting listening to 'Animals' and yet again that thought crosses my mind, can you ever relate Pink Floyd to substandard material ..... because, quite simply all of their music I've listened to is definitely nothing short of excellent combining raw genius with a great sense of pure innovation. 'Animals', the Floyd's tenth studio album, released in 1977 is another example of this - another Floyd album which gives you something different to what you've heard from the band before in previous and subsequent albums. This is definitely one of their more underrated works - Dark Side and Wish You Were Here are in mine and many others opinions the greatest Floyd works but this one (and Meddle from 1971 also) are not far behind them in terms of excellence.<br /><br />Pink Floyd were certainly given a reality check around the time of this albums recording in 1977 as the rock genre in general was going through a transitional period. The punk revolution in Britain was very much taking hold around this time and those involved were very much committed to knock bands like the Floyd, with their supposedly 'long, drawn out meaningless music' out of the music scene altogether. With 'Animals', the Floyd made the perfect response and showed that no way were they a dead cause (for the record, the Floyd have and will never die - their mass popularity amongst loads of generations will see to that!). It is very much a change in direction to what was seen in the previous Floyd album, 'Wish You Were Here' with its combined tribute to original Floyd frontman Syd Barratt and attack on the music industry. Animals draws its inspiration from George Orwell's Animal farm and the ideas of a pecking order in society (i.e. the dogs, pigs and sheep) and the opression and troubles which arises from it. Also in 'Animals' is some of Dave Gilmour's finest work on lead guitar and it gives the album real impetus - there's some great guitar lines in parts and he plays out some of the riffs brilliantly. This couples with some further experimental genius certainly were voice overs are concerned - there is some very clever keyboard work from Rick Wright in the album as a whole. This was the first album which the Floyd recorded away from the Abbey Road studios, at their newly fitted out recording studio at Brittania Row in London - they also (i.e. Gilmour and Waters) did much of the mixing and engineering of the album themselves - a great group effort overall in those terms, sadly a thing which was to break down in subsequent albums when Roger Water's ego expanded too greatly for the band to handle.<br /><br />So, to the music on the album itself. The album has only 5 tracks but the bulk of this in 3 of them. The album opens and closes with 2, just a minute long acoustic pieces called 'Pigs on a Wing' which gives the album a unique feeling. The first epic track on 'Animals' is the 17 minute 'Dogs'. Theres some great guitar work on this track and also some clever keyboard work which imitates the sound of a dog barking very effectively - great lyrics too, the 'Animal Farm' theme soon kicks in. 'Pigs, 3 Different Ones' follows this - a track with a classic Pink Floyd tempo and chord progression - a great keyboard opening. Listen out for the pigs snorting also in parts. The 'Pigs' track then blends well into 'Sheep' which follows - the track has a clever sequence with a rather futuristic sounding voice speaking a rather distorted version of Psalm 23, the words are actually bitterly truthful, using the sheep theme to represent those who are oppressed and doomed in life. The closing riff to the track from Gilmour is a killer - I'm sure is another one of those Floyd riffs that has been ripped off by many subsequent bands, it sounds all too familiar. Just sums it up really, the Floyd are such an influential band!<br /><br />Therefore, an overlooked Pink Floyd classic not to be missed out on. Theres some amazing material on here which spells out another illustrious chapter in the bands history. Oh, and I forgot about the cover - the pig flying high over Battersea Power Station, now thats an album cover youll not forget in a hurry! 'Animals' is a must for any Pink Floyd fan or for anyone who likes a clever, sometimes alternative direction in rock.ther illustrious chapter in the bands history.

0316172324|1.0|I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in.  This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing.  At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point).  At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about \\"thinking without thinking.\\"  If you're interested in the thesis \\"the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,\\"  buy the book.  Because that's all there is to it.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|This wasn't the greatest movie.  It was actually kind of studid and lame.  It had no point to it, but it was hilarious.  Just the things napoleon said were hilarious along with the other characters in the movie.  He did what he wanted to and likes to draw cartoons and animal beasts.  Its about napoleon and his 2 new friends that decide to elect his friend pedro for class president.
B0002OERI0|4.0|If you're still stuck on the days of Dookie and crave that era of music from them, then this may not be the album for you. But I say you should still buy it. Why? Because of track #10: Letterbomb. It's old-school classic Green Day at their best and makes this album worth it with just that song. Even if you don't like the rest, you'll still be somewhat happy. <br /> <br />If you're a new listener to Green Day and you've heard them on the radio, buy this album! It's the best pop-rock album of 2004 and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Many classic sing-a-longs and head shakers. <br /> <br />Although it's not the 'punk' that Green Day was once known for it's a good buy for just about anyone who likes rock.

0393312836|4.0|The main character in A Clockwork Orange, Alex, has many hobbies such as stealing, fighting, raping, murdering, and listening to classical music.  As you hopefully can tell, Alex isn't your typical teenager, and this is not your typical novel.  Instead it is a quirky and offbeat story that highlights the conflict between individuality and conformity. It also dips into the realm of totalitarian governments, propaganda, brainwashing and pretty much everything else that has to do with THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLING YOU.  Alex lives in a desolate near-future world were his friends are not his friends, his enemies are not his enemies, and nothing is truly what it seems.  From page one it is evident that Alex is already a sub-human whose only emotions are rage, jealousy, greed, lust, and hatred.  He has no aspirations, no goals, and no motives of any kind. The reader follows him through the night and bears witness to his senseless and repeated acts of violence and destruction.  Although he believes he is the master of his own domain, it is made evident throughout the story that he is nothing more than a mere pawn. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book because it made me think about how the world may someday be.  In many respects it reminded me of George Orville's 1984, in that it creates a world where human rights are frequently violated so that the government can control the entire population.  I will admit that the unique language in which Alex speaks is obnoxious until you eventually decipher the meaning of his words.  On the whole though, A Clockwork Orange is a quick read that you will not be able to put down, and it will keep you thinking long after you finish it. <br />
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It's spoken in italian, but it makes the movie even more great.  It's about a Jewish/Italian family who gets caught in italy.  They have to go to a concentration camp and live the rest of their lives in there.  The parents have to do work throughout the day while the kids are watched by officers of the camp, but they eventually get killed in the oven.  It's a very sad story, but i would recommend seeing it.
0380002930|5.0|The main characters of Watership Down may be fluffy little bunnies, but the novel should not be written off as a children's book. It has enough danger and drama to keep the pages turning until you realize in disappointment that you have reached the last one. At the same time, it has something more to offer. Beneath the bare bones of the plot, an unseen hand paints a charming portrait of the English countryside in the green and yellow tones of midsummer. These pastoral images are all the more enchanting when seen through the eyes of a rabbit, and the more you read, the more you actually begin to think like one. At the first sign of danger, a rabbit's instincts tell him to go underground, into the safety of the earth. This is the more subtle message of Watership Down - reconciliation with Mother Nature. Out on the down with Hazel-rah and the rest of the warren rabbits, simple days yield simple pleasures. Happiness is found in the warmth of the sunlight and the lazy hum of the bees in the tall grass. Nothing else is needed, except a friend or two to share the moment. This is the message that Richard Adams has conveyed through his skillful painting of words.

B00005JNEW|5.0|This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made, and it's one of my favorites.  It's about the Permian Panthers making their way through their season, with a bunch of tradgities happening to them.  At the first couple games of the season , it looks like a blowoff with their star athlete, booby miles.  He gets seriously injured in one of his games, and that costs the team their season.  It's a great movie to watch and its also an intense film.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|Bridget Jones 1 was amusing and light.  Bridget Jones Edge of Reason should never have been released.  This movie is absolutely terrible from start to finish.  Firstly, it lacks the originality and charm of the first one -- a symptom of being a forced sequel.  Secondly, it's not funny in the least.  Thirdly, the acting is terrible.  I am usually a fan of Renee, but she is terrible here.  Hugh Grant puts in his usual canned performance, and someone should really tell him it's time for him to try a slightly different role in the interest of saving his career and pride.  Colin First is just plain unlikeable. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is a great kids movie.  I even enjoyed seeing it.  It's about a couple of monsters living the monster world, goin to the most important job in town.  The 2 main characters mike and sully are the best of friends, and they're partners on the scare floor.  They go into little kids rooms and scare them to provide energy for their town.  One of the scarers tries to get ahead of the game and tries to cheat his way, but everything goes wrong. Sully and mike are in the middle of everything and this shows how they make their way through the dilema.
B0007D5FZK|4.0|Hi<br />It Comes in a black Plastic case with the cover, Opens like pages with one disc per compartment. (2disc 2 compartments) <br />There was no insert or coupon ( I like inserts that have info and pics! it's like an egg you dont have to look for). no worry none in the compartment.<BR> <BR>There was no Paper information other than a card advertising other trek dvds to buy and even it was one sided.<br />-Disc one is the film. <br />-Disc two has the extras,  If you do not happen to be a big fan of the films directer ( Jonathon Frakes) then you may get tired of how great he is said to be. But hey they can not say bad things and get in the extras part of the dvd LOL.<br />-So far I have found Three Easter eggs or not so obvious extras. I wont tell you what they are but where they are at the end. Otay. <br />This dvd is in wide screen and the picture was great on my 20&quot;Flat screen toshiba tv. Also Nice on a Jvc 27&quot; just to let you know. <BR>For a few shots in the film I Used my dvd zoom and they still looked great.<br />There are subtitles and CC.  <BR>If your dvdplayer does transmitt CC dvd you can view cc or subtitles. NOTE: Not all dvds have subtitles but some come only CC and not all players transmit the CC signal...So if that is a issue well now u know.<br />At this price and the fact that it was fast delivery to my post box then home and ripped off the shrink wrap and made popcorn and Zoomed up the volume...and hit play.... OoPS Sorry!<BR>OK I had this movie on Vhs and and and I like the film ok. I would buy this dvd for my relatives ad friends but they don't dig it the way I do. so that is that.<br />A gripe was made about the ... Female character of color in the movie... If you watch the extras you find out why her character was there. I liked her. but thats just me. <br />This Film is an action trek film and tells you some trek history.  Some is quite kind of dark and a bit of fright in the borg theme, but these are the bad guys right! (I do not like horror so its not like that).<BR> Take note though of the rating of the film before you stuff the kiddies in front of it and then later get mad if they want to crawl in your bed. :)<BR>  <BR>You have to just love the borg Queen!!! or luv to dislike her as the case may be.<br />As for the Eggs I found.... ALL on disc 2<BR>You will see the spheres on either side when the main menu comes up. AT PRODUCTION move curser to right and the circle turns red ENTER.<br />At StarTrek Universe enter, @ Jerry goldsmith tribute try right or left to hilite the circle and enter.<br />The last I found was at Borg Collective Enter then down to the bottom hilite menu  and move to left to hilite the circle and it has turned red as the others did. enter.<br />Off i go to try it with the commentaries.... Fun fun I hope!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is a great movie.  Its one of the funniest i've seen too.  Will Farrell plays as a an elf in the movie, but he doens't realize he isn't one.  He was a little kid in an orphanage, when santa came down to deliver presents on chrismas eve.  Farrel some how climbed out of his crib and snuck into the present bag.  Santa went back to the north pole with the baby in his bag.  Ever since he's been living in the north pole, twice the size of everbody else,  and having the greatest time of his life.  He finds out he's not an elf and deides to go to New York to find his dad.  He finds him and lives the rest of his life in New York.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|ROBOTS is a fun filled, family friendly film that keeps everyone entertained.  However, after some clever jokes, the film falls into the same race-to-get-somewhere-without-any-plot-development that seems to plague most animated films recently.  SHREK 2 went overboard with its GHOSTBUSTERS II ending, MONSTERS INC. opened too many doors, and now ROBOTS goes on and on endlessly.  Although, Robin Williams saves the day along the way.  Kids will love it (in fact, the kid behind me giggled so loud so often, I found him to be funnier than the movie at times), and adults will be happy to keep the kids busy while not being board out of their minds.  Where this film would have been rated higher a few years ago, it is now just your average run-of-the-mill computer generated storyline.
B000002UAU|5.0|One of the greatest albums I ever heard. Unbelievable songwriting. Instead of ripping off American R&B and Rock artists they truly have their own sound with this album. Even though this wasn't the first concept album, this is the blueprint for all concept albums to follow.
B00005JNQQ|2.0|Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) grows up with his Mom and Dad (Dianne Wiest and Stanley Tucci) telling him that he will, one day, do great things. As a young man, he sets off to the big city to meet Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the creator of all of the robots, a great benevolent robot.  Rodney wants to be an inventor and knows that Big Weld will value and help him with his ideas. Upon arrival, he learns that Big Weld's corporation has been taken over by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent). Rodney soon learns of their plans and enlists the aid of his new friends to help him.<br /><br />\\"Robots\\", directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, the folks behind \\"Ice Age\\", is a bright, colorful, richly detailed film with very little plot.<br /><br />The animation is very well done. All of the robots have slightly burnished edges or area where the paint is wearing away. This detail, coupled with an overall 50s-era visual reference creates a unique and interesting visual style that many adults may find interesting. Hopefully, because that is about all the adults will enjoy.<br /><br />It is very easy to tell each of the studios animated films apart. The Disney and Pixar films are at the top of the heap. They contain an attention to detail unrivaled. Characters and story are developed to the point that they could be real people. The films contain true comedy, suspense or drama, as the story dictates. The films are also worked out to contain a lot of interesting moments for young and old alike. They appeal to everyone, which is why they will become classics. Dreamworks has a mixed record, but their \\"Shrek\\" films are classics, containing all of the thought and attention to detail found in a Disney film. The \\"Shrek\\" films are funny, irreverent gag filled fairy tales which appeal to everyone. The Fox animated films are none of these things. \\"Robots\\" is fun to look at, but the story if overly simplistic.<br /><br />None of the voice actors is memorable or funny. Ewan McGregor seems to be auditioning for his next dramatic role. Halle Berry, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, Drew Carey and many more all join in, to little or no effect. The only actor who seems to be a natural fit is Robin Williams. But he is basically doing the same shtick he always does. And it is less funny than it was in \\"Aladdin\\".<br /><br />\\"Robots\\" will clearly enchant the children with the bright colors and the fast moving sequences. The adults will most likely find the short preceding the film more funny than \\"Robots\\". It features Skrich, the squirrel from \\"Ice Age\\" in a hilarious tribute to the Looney Tunes cartoons of the 50s.s memorable or funny.

B00008OLYN|5.0|What can I say ... somewhere in the middle of \\"Hope Leaves\\", I remembered having watery eyes ... I have listened to a lot of music from Norah Jones through Dream Theater to Pantera, but no music has ever struck such a strong emotional chord than this one 43-minute effort from a death metal band. The songs are generally about post-relationship sadness and depression. I believe that there is a certain beauty to the feeling of sadness that Opeth has captured in a highly emotional outpouring of melancholic guitars, mellotrons, amazing drums and the gorgeous voice of Mike Akerfeldt.<br /><br />There is absolutely no moment in this record that sounds boring, \\"Hope Leaves\\" being the strongest point. The only moment that I was dissapointed was at the end of the last song when I longed for the sadness to continue ...<br /><br />A lot of negative reviews for this album are based on comparisions to other prog. rock legends. Please folks, this is a unique piece of work that needs to be appreciated on its own. And, by the way, if Metal were to be about depression, sadness, gloom, melancholy, and negativity in general, then ladies and gentlemen ... this IS Metal.<br /><br />PS: It really helps if you imagine yourself alone in a dark alpine forest in Sweden during peak-winter before beginning to listen to this album. (Or better yet, imagine yourself in the place that appears on the album cover of Opeth's Morningrise).
B00000J2SO|5.0|I really cant believe some of the bad reviews this album gets especially the criticism of Graham Bonnet's vocals, I tell you I havent heard many singers come near to the power and passion this guy has in his voice. A lot of people just cant see past Ronnie Dio who was also a great singer but the wrong kind of singer for the direction which Ritchie Blackmore took with this album. Graham Bonnet was absolutely the perfect choice here, you just cannot imagine how classic tracks such as Since You Been Gone, All Night Long and the awesome Love's No Friend would sound without this guy. Not only that I found him a guy you could Identify more with than the old dungeon master Dio, a bit more down to earth... Anyway, as you can probably tell the guy became an all time hero to me with this album, right up there with Rob Halford of the Priest.  <br /> <br />Anyway onto the songs themselves, all the songs on the album are great apart from 1, No Time to Lose, which is just a throwaway filler track. Along with the 3 aforementioned tracks the other standout tracks are Eyes of the World and Danger Zone, dont know how many times ive lost my voice trying to sing those songs when im drunk, not many singers could pull em off like old leatherlungs Bonnet, awesome stuff! so buy this album, buy a few six packs, get out the big shades and the cardboard guitar and play it loud, Bonnet and Blackmore rock, 24 carat gold, absolute dynamite! <br /> <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|The opening scene is shot in slow motion with Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) dancing on the balls of his feet in a boxing ring while wearing a robe with the hood over his head.  The area in which the boxing ring is located is full of cigarette smoke, as occasional flashes of cameras try to capture the moment before a fight.  Jake throws some punches into the smoky air while soothing music is played throughout the scene.  It seems absurd to play this kind of music to boxing, yet the music continues.  Despite the absurdity of the music it will make sense to the audience as the story unfolds.  The blood red title, Raging Bull, appears as a bad omen between the ropes of the boxing ring while Jake keeps dancing on the balls of his feet.  Shortly after, the screen shows the year to be 1964 and the name of the city as New York.  The audience can hear Jake's voice saying, \\"I remember those cheers, they still ring in my ears, for years they remain in my thoughts, `cause one night, I took off my robe and what'd do? I forgot to wear shorts.\\"<br /><br />After the recital by Jake in 1964, the film turns into one monumental flashback beginning in 1941, which is unlocked by a powerful hook into Jake's face.  This punch into Jake's face has a symbolic value as to how he sees the world.  Hubris comes to mind when one thinks of Jake's persona, a man with exaggerated pride and confidence.  Overtly he walks the talk that he backs up with his two lethal fists and an attitude that can take any kind of beating.  His attitude also projects an image that he needs no body, as he punishes those who he fights in the ring through murderous punches.  Through boxing Jake dreams of getting a title match, but his attitude seems to turn people away from him.  His brother, Joey (Joe Pesci), tries hard to get him the match while he tries to sway him to do what the people in power want him to do.<br /><br />In the world of boxing testosterone flood every aspect of life, as hurting someone is what brings home the bread.  Successful boxers are treated like gold and their aggressiveness is nurtured to perfection.  Hostility is needed to destroy the opponent while compassion and sympathy are being perceived as a weakness. Everything surrounds this attitude in boxing, and Jake is the best there is at hurting others.  Domination is what he brings with him wherever he goes--even home to his small apartment, where his wife slaves for him in front of the stove.  De Niro does a magnificent job in being perceived as a male chauvinistic pig in his role as Jake when he uses his wife as a verbal punching bag.<br /><br />When Jake first sees the neighborhood girl Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) he falls in love at first sight.  When Jake's wife finds out about it she leaves him, which probably was the best thing for her, and he begins to date Vickie instead.  Their relationship is not based on mutual respect and commitment, but more on Jake's bestial desires.  During the time when Jake sees Vickie he continues to box and dream for a title match.  However, no one is willing to give him one.  Something happens at home where Jake does not give into Vickie's desires, as Jake does not want it to affect his boxing.  Nonetheless, in between fights Jake and Vickie get married.  The moments between fights, including the wedding, are depicted through the only color scenes in the film, seemingly shot by a personal camera without sound, but symbolically it offers some of the happiest moments in Jake's life.<br /><br />Through Jake's attitude he does not get any chance at the title, and because of the way he has been knocking out his opponents no one wants to box him.  When Jake finds out that Joey has set up a fight against a younger and lighter boxer, he gets upset.  This moment turns the whole film in a new direction, as Jake's inability to understand women is magnified.  His view of women seems to be heavily colored by his upbringing where women were supposed to serve the men while in a socialcontext they are perceived as either virgins or whores.  In addition, Jake must begin to diet which probably plays further tricks with his mind while he is working out to get into top shape for a possible title match.  His aggressiveness turns into jealousy and distrustful paranoia, as he begins to watchfully observe Vickie's every move while he is around.  Eventually, Jake begins to imagine that Vickie is doing something dishonest, which explodes on the day when he asks his brother if he has slept with her.<br /><br />It turns into a downward spiraling affair for Jake, as he loses everything he has worked so hard to gain in the boxing ring, the only place where it seems that he fits in--a place where he feels that he is in harmony.  This brings back the notion of the soothing music in the opening of the film.  Nonetheless, Jake learns his lesson, but at a very high price.  As the film comes full circle, the audience is brought back to New York in 1964.  In the beginning of the film, the audience can see the same poster that was shown in the beginning of the film, which showed Jake La Motta's name on the top and botton stating \\"Tonight 8:30\\". This is the second time the audience gets to see the whole poster, which will provide some insight to what Jake La Motta gained throughout the film.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese directs a powerful film that deals with wisdom, identity, and love through boxing.  Using visual symbolism and other ways he directed many of the scenes.  The black and white photography makes it feel like minimalism, yet all scenes are very rich in details, but not excessively thanks to Scorsese's meticulous approach to what is in the frame of the camera.  De Niro's performance was brilliant and well worth the Oscar it won, as he must have gained a tremendous amount of weight during time it took to make the film.  The cinematography is excellent by Michael Chapman, as it helps highlight the emotional moments and the brutal fight scenes.  When all the cinematic aspects of filmmaking come together in Raging Bull it offers a truly brilliant cinematic experience, which will leave the audience in awe for a very long time.social context they are perceived as either virgins or whores.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|So far I've read that ND is a male version of WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and in many respects, that's true. The major differences are that the main character in WTTD knows she's a dork, knows the other kids ridicule her for it, yet feels powerless to stop it and just unempowered in general.Not so with ND.  Although Napoleon is a dork among dorks, he's oblivious to it all. His apathy with life in general serves as a protective shield, and if he feels victimizes, he doesn't let it get him down and doesn't show it.  In a strange way, he has a lot of self confidence, because in his eyes, he's okay, and that's what matters.The story moves against a backdrop of gorgeous Idaho landscapes.  Who knew there was more to Idaho than just potatoes?Here's the story: Napoleon is an apathetic nerd whose life is inhabited by a daredevil, dune-bike-riding grandma and a cybergeek brother named Kip.  The Dynamite parents are both conspicuosly absent.  Grandma and Kip treat him with a good deal of indifference and apathy.  Even Pedro, the gentle-natured Mexican boy he befriends, is indifferent to a degree.  Then one day Grandma injures herself while riding her dune bike, and Uncle Rico, a washed-up football player yearing for his glory days, commandeers the house.  Undoubtedly he's come to stay so that he can take advantage of Grandma's absence in order to give himself a break from living in his early 80's behemoth orange housevan.  Between eating all the red meat in the house and selling dubious goods door to door with Kip, Uncle Rico makes Napoleon live in complete mortification by screwing up his dating life and just embarrassing him in general.It gets better when Pedro decides to run for class president, but I'll let you watch and see!  The humor is so deadpan in ND that at times you may forget to laugh.  If you rewatch it, you'll see all the funny parts you missed the first time and laugh out loud!
0451169514|5.0|I'll keep this review short:  This book was creepy from the very beginning.  I like how King's monsters aren't always supernatural; some of the human characters in this book are scarier than It!  If you like horror novels and haven't read this one yet, read it.<br /><br />A side note:  When one gets near the end, and if one is familiar with H.P. Lovecraft's work, they'll see a remarkable similarity.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This film possible ranks as one of Hitchcock's best.<br /><br /> The premise is the growing paranoia of Stewart as, laying up injured in his flat, he is given to snooping on his neighbours in the block of flats visible from his living room. He has a high old time giving them names and animating their lives based on their day to day comings and goings as he witnesses them.<br /><br /> Then he believes he has stumbled on a murder as one of the more brutish neighbours (Burr) seems to lose his wife, increasingly he gets his georgous girlfriend, Lisa (Kelly) and his acid tongued Nurse (Ritter) in on his theory.<br /><br /> A remarkable study in human behaviour and paranoia with beautiful constructed sets and camera work, Stewart is intense and increasingly unhinged as the film progresses, Kelly is cool, collected and stunningly beautiful and Ritter is bitingly humorous.<br /><br /> The film is also now a great study into life in 50's America with it's themes of domesticity hiding a thinly veiled sense of wrong doing and paranoia, while the avant garde is frowned upon and scapegoated. Excellent and highly intelligent stuff.
B00000IAU3|5.0|<br /> <br />My older sister owned Dido's first CD \\"No Angel\\" first and I would listen to it on the stairs while it was turned up on the highest volume possible. I now own this CD and I have listened to it in one day which isn't impossible.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Dido's music creates a wide variety of tunes and scenarios in which the music could relate too, the first track on the CD \\"Here with me\\" is a prime example of this. Afterward the music continues to change into a more sadder or angsty sound, much like \\"Don't think of me\\" and \\"My Lover's gone\\" without skipping a beat and sometimes the tracks seem to run together.  Tracks 7 \\"Honestly, OK,\\" Track 8 \\"Slide,\\" Track 9 \\"Dear Isabel,\\" Track 10 \\"No Angel\\" and Track 11 \\"My life\\" are also prime examples.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />But by far the best songs on this soundtrack of Dido's has to be \\"Thank you\\" and The bonus Track \\"Take my hand.\\" Which is a sweet ballad of violins and manipulated sounds of a dreamy sense. All in all I enjoyed \\"NO ANGEL\\"; it a wonderful CD worth buying. [a 5 out of 5]
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Honestly, the negative criticism of this music from so many people must come from fans of At The Drive In or similar emo-pop garbage, or dare I say it, Clearchannel. I've been a serious collector of music from all genres of music most of my adult life with thousands of records in my collection, and I can say honestly that this is some of the most refreshing rock-oriented music of the past few years. The Mars Volta manages to out-do Radiohead's attempts at reliving Kraut-Rock through the lens of '80s Post-Punk and Alt-Rock by fusing modern electronica with '70s space rock and prog-rock, adding a dash of free jazz, noise rock, vocals that sound like they belong in an aggressive arena rock setting, and a rhythmic sensibility that sounds like Robert Fripp decided to hook up with Melt Banana.  <br /> <br />This is neo-prog that outdoes all other neo-prog by adding that one element so often forgotten in that scene -- creativity and originality. These guys are masters at improvisation, texture, dynamics, and atmosphere, somehow managing to include a serious dose of hard rock aggression and pop songcraft. If you have any interest in art music at all, pick up this album as well as its predecessor. <br /> <br />A+
B00068IOWC|5.0|It' s a shame that envy and lack of talent, unappreciation of art have become the order of the day. And that it is happening with the storm of bad reviews of this fantastic U2 opus. I am not going to say anything the songs in this cd. It is the type of music that must be taken as a whole and compact group of songs woven through a multicoloured rug. It is the inability of keeping up with the current times. And to make it short, and despite of whatever people say and think, time will prove that U2 is the greatest band on earth today. It takes guts and responsability to stick together for more than 20 years.
B000063DHL|3.0|I bought this  really soon after I got hooked on a burnt copy of powerslave, I didnt really know what to expect but I was pretty damn surprised at the synthwork, this album defenitely marks a high point in the musicianship aspect of maiden, even though they were never sloppy before.  <br /> <br />Alot of the percussion has more double bass than what youre used to hearing from nicko (not a bad thing at all) and the bass is just as melodic and pounding as before, and they are all just kicking ass througout... but the production seems a little more distant and sometimes the guitars get buried under it which means that alot of the melodies are not as clean and clear as they should be but the risky move pays off because the synths add alot to the songs... even though they defenitely comes off a little too strongly once in a while. <br /> <br />There are a few songs on this album that are catchy (heaven can wait, stranger in a strange land, wasted years) but dont really have the substance of the others...The songs caught somewhere in time, and the lonilness of the long distance runner have some of Iron maidens most elegant melodies... and theyre also heavier than most of what theyve done up to this point in the classic era. Sea of madness also has a really awesome chorus... and alexander the great is pretty good, even though there is sort of a noodling section in it that doesnt mesh well with the song. <br /> <br />I think the good songs on this album, are defenitely worth the price (actually the best songs on somewhere in time would give anything on piece of mind or powerslave a run for their money) but there are also alot of other sections where it gets repetetive, and the songs all tend to blur into each other... there is a pretty well defined prog thing going on here too, and a few of the songs lose momentum because there are some relentlessly mean solos that unfortunately drag on a bit, but the guys always pull the songs back into perspective just before youre readyto get frustrated or bored. <br /> <br />If you were to just buy this album,having never heard any other Iron maiden albums, it would stand pretty high on its own, but Id probably get any one of the other three \\"classic dickinson\\" maiden albums first... even though some of my favorite iron maiden songs are on this album.
0780021967|5.0|I admit I have a special affinity with this film and therefore would probably offer a slighty biased review, it was made the same year my home was built. But the glaring fact is it is still a cracking film and superbly acted. It is a cracking pursuit film and mark's out what was to become Hitchcock's definitive style, paranoid pursuits, dhastidly spy plots and the scapegoated do gooder. I won't spell out the plot because if you don't know the 39 steps then you must have been living under a rock! This film is the first and best version, the 1950's version is credible but the 70's version is weak and pointless.<br /><br /> Donat is cracking and it is such a shame he was taken away from us so soon, he died of an asthma attack in the 50's making \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\", with Ingrid Bergman.<br /><br /> Carrol proves to be the first in a long line of Hithcock's cool blondes, she is feisty and forthright which although common now was unheard of in her time, woman usually played whimpering damsel's in distress so she really broke the mould.<br /><br /> Again, after a brief flirtation in a Bob Hope film during the war years, she dissappeared from the silver screen.<br /><br /> Carrol's Sister was killed in the London Blitz, after which she became a Nurse and she returned only to the London Stage after the WW2. This is a cracking film, the accents are terrible plummy and frightfully, awfully British, which kind of adds to it's appeal; it speaks as much of a lost Britain as it does of espionage. There is also a brief appearance by Peggy Ashcroft (Later \\"Dame\\") as a young, terrified, Scottish Crofters wife. EXCELLENT viewing!
B0007GAEW6|2.0|hmmm. what can i say about the new album expect its virtually impossible to lsiten all the way through. while DE-Loused was considerably long the song strcutures pretty focused and werent as meandering as the follow up. The album is pratcially one 77 minute drugged out jam that is diificult to listen to. It does though have handful spralling and engaging moments but that is usually neglected by long periods of silence or pshydellica tweaks thats makes this 77 minute effort seem like 3 hours. decent in its own right but ntohing reaches the catharatic and grooving heights of DE-Loused.underwhelming
B000000H3W|5.0|I bought this album for the cover (found out about Morbid Angel's Blessed Are The Sick the same way)  At the time, '91, I was looking for fast aggressive music and when I picked up Sepultura's Arise and saw the cover I said to myself \\"This album looks like its going to kick my ass into the ground\\".  And it did.  Not just because the music is so brutal and well recorded, but because of the nature of the lyrics which are thoughtful, very political and VERY angry.  They're worthy of any number of '80s era punk bands (not the limp pop mind candy of today) that put their frustration with the world and it's injustice to music.  Max Cavalera's almost death metal like vocal delivery just ups the intensity. Arise is Sepultura's finest album if not their most musically sophisticated.  This is before they got interested in tribal music, when Max, Igor, Andreas and Paulo wanted to just kick some major ass, thrash and vent. Quite simply, at the time they were probably the best metal band on the planet.  Who knew that sunny Brazil could be such a hotbed for metal activity?  It's a long way from The Girl From Ipanema to Infected Voice.  The bonus tracks included in this release make a great album that much better.  Buy it now.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I originally intended to watch Saw in the theatres to get the full effect that I thought I could get from such a movie. Thank god I didn't waste my money. Now usually I'm a pretty easy going critic of scary movies. But this one I just couldn't appreciate no matter how hard I tried. As far as the plot line goes, it wasn't too bad. The fact that its been done a million times, the bad guy trying to teach \\"innocent\\" people lessons, is getting a little played out. The aspect of the movie which I could not get over was the HORRIBLE acting. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell over acted so much that it seemed funny. Even Danny Glover, who played a disjointed cop, was unconvincing. It got to the point that I was wishing someone would stop playing games with him and just put ME out of my misery by killing both of them. Now not to take anything away from the plot because I actually thought it was still creative even after being done a million times before. I also liked James Wan use of lighting and how he kept things a little abstract and dark so that we couldn't get the whole picture until the end. Now Saw 2 is in pre-production and I can only hope the casting director will step up and get some really good actors so we can all enjoy the \\"Jigsaw Killer's\\" next little game!
B000021XS0|4.0|I certainly appreciate Dream Theatre's work...as a Prog rock fan since the early 1970s, I believe DT puts together a completely full package for both the prog rock AND the heavy metal fans to enjoy.  It is a difficult and fine line to play and they do it masterfully.  DT appears to occupy that knife edge of space between where KING CRIMSON achieves industrial heavy metal from the prog rock side and where TOOL achieves prog rock from the metal side.  Understandably, some (okay, most) people may not like this genre since it completely assaults the senses, but truely there is no denying the superb talent of these five guys.  Their combined knowledge of the full spectrum of different kinds of music is spilling out from every conceivable nook and cranny of sound space to produce some of the most densely populated, textured, melodic and hard driving wall of tunes that anyone could expect from any successful band.  After listening about 5 times to Images and Words and Metropolis 2, it appears that DT is the BEST at analyzing all the Prog and Metal that has ever been written since 1968, stripping it down to fundamental components, stringing bits and pieces together and then restructuring and integrating it all into a seamless package that will take you on a historical ride through 6 or 7 musical styles.  By the time they have sewn it all up neatly and added the wide range of vocals, it has become a completely solid nut that very few bands could crack to try to emulate, copy, play or even figure out the timing and tempo changes.   It is true, though, that DT themselves copy and emulate very specific bands of years past, but personally I believe it is what they do with that information that is important, and that is where DT shines.  Just one very specific example of this absorption of other bands...check out Metropolis Pt 2, Act I, Scene Three, II  Fatal Tragedy - right at the end, before LaBrie starts singing Scene Four, Beyond this Life - there is an unmistakable \\"likeness\\" of a Zappa-esque segment that goes on for about 1 minute....Now, we all know that there is NO WAY that these five virtuosos are not fully aware that they were \\"heavily influenced\\" by Zappa in a very precise manner for this segment (hell...who do you think they studied in music school?).  But that is cool, cuz it is a great tribute to the pioneering prog rock genius that FZ embodies and it is integrated into their song beautifully. (If you have ever listened to Frank Zappa, you will know EXACTLY what/where I am talking about). Other examples? Scene Six - Home (great song!) = sped up version of TOOL's 46 & 2?;  Scenes Eight/Nine - sure sounds like Floyd's The Wall; Metropolis Part 1 - consists of some Steve Morse/Dixie Dregs followed by Jeff Beck and King Crimson, drifting into Kansas....And they do this throughout, like a machine, grabbing onto all these prog rock/metal tidbits from all over the world and assimilating them into their songs. They are the \\"BORG\\" of prog rock/metal, but it works for me since it reminds me of nearly every band I have loved listening to throughout these 35 years.....Zeppelin, King Crimson, Yngwie, Steve Morse, Marillion, Rush, Kansas, ELP, YES, TOOL, Al Di Meola, Jeff Beck...I think I even heard my 1970's favorite - Jethro Tull in there somewhere.  All the greatest bands have done similar actions - perhaps not so blatantly, however.  Nevertheless, keep up the great work, DT......MUSIC and FANS WILL BE ASSIMILATED.....RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.....four stars for obvious superb muscianship
0805076476|5.0|You know why I love to read?  Because you can go at your own pace.  You can go back and re-read a beautifully written line.  You can take the time to roll it around in your head, to say it out loud--to just appreciate what the writer has done.  You can put the book down for a couple minutes while your mind absorbs a new idea.  Some books are good simply because they tell an interesting story.  Other books are good because they INVOLVE you--they make you squirm, make you think about your own life.  These books call you to decide whether you agree or disagree with their content, and then you find it necessary to dig a little deeper to understand why you feel the way you do.  These books can teach you little something about yourself.  These books are an experience.  Fight Club is such a book.   <br /> <br />Many reviews have compared the movie to the book.  The movie was amazing--they didn't mess it up.  It was perfect, exactly what it should've been. <br /> <br />Still, I enjoyed the book more.  The stark, one-line paragraphs.  The disjointed prose.  Tyler's quotes.  The incredibly real descriptions.  THE HOLE IN HIS CHEEK. I watched the movie, I experienced the book.   <br /> <br />Read this book.  You don't need me to give you a synopsis, or tell you my interpretations.  Just read it.  This book is real, it's alive.  It will talk to you and ask you questions.  Take the time to answer it back.
0385720920|2.0|Choke by Chuck Palanhuik starts out with a bang, but quickly boils down to nothing more than a whimper.  <br />   Many people have compared Palanhuik to genius Kurt Vonnegut, but Palanhuik should never be mentioned in the same sentence as Vonnegut. Vonnegut uses the weird as story telling devices, while Palanhuik's books are weird for the sake of weird. <br />  The story starts out by grabbing the readers attention, by talking about the trials and tribulations of the main character, Victor Mancini. Victor was kidnapped at an early age by his \\"mother\\", is a sex addict, pretends to choke on food to get money, is a medical school drop-out, and thinks he is the second coming of Christ. All of those might seem to make for an interesting character, but like the rest of the characters in the book, he never changes or grows. <br />  Palahnuik tries to satirize the empty, chaotic mess of society today, but it seems as though his book is nothing more than a product of the times. The book uses profanities, \\"plot twists\\", and gross out tactics only to reach out to the target audience, rather than use them to tell a meaningful story. <br />   At the end, the reader is left cold and upset. Since Palahniuk never establishes his characters well enough, the reader doesn't care what happens to them at the end. Also, the ending is very anti-climatic, that it seems to defeat the entire purpose of reading the book. At the end, nothing is learned, nothing is gained; no one learns anything, and the reader learns nothing about the human condition. <br />   Choke is nothing more than entertaining tripe, that has a weak plot and a pointless existance. <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|1- lullaby; at first they remind me of a different band, i'm not quite sure who though. it's very deep and a little dark, but it's a slow introduction to a good album. <br />2- medication; it does sound like a rewrite of feel good hit of the summer but there's something that makes it 'medication' [and no, not just the lyrics]. it's pretty catchy. i'm surprised they didn't make this the single from the album. <br />3- everyone knows that you're insane; great song. very catchy, i also wonder why this one wasn't a single, it would have made a great name for the album, it's a little slow to begin but it speeds up <br />4- tangled up in plaid; very eclectic, another great track on this album <br />5- burn the witch; once you get into the song, it's very southern, to an extent. it has that feel. <br />6- in my head; also a great single, very straightforward <br />7- little sister; THE single from this album, understandably so, very upbeat from the beginning, it reminds me of a song by someone else but i can't think of who, maybe hot hot heat [just the beginning] <br />8- i never came; this reminds me of another artist too, just the beginning riffs do at least <br />9- someone's in the wolf; another great song, i'm running out of adjectives to use <br />10- the blood is love; starts out sort of like the introduction but delves into rock, drums, etc. very good <br />11- skin on skin; starts out upbeat, one of only a couple songs to do so on this album, the blocks add a bit of character to the song <br />12- broken box; sort of sounds like dance music if it were a little more upbeat, still good <br />13- you've got a killer scene there; very qotsa.  <br />14- long slow goodbye; a great closer to a wonderful album, almost sounds like a closing song <br />15- [hidden track]; orchestral, sort of like the beginning, but continues the melody from track 14 into an orchestral context..  <br /> <br />the album overall is great, i'd go out there and buy it if i were you, it's something that will top your 2005 list of great albums
B00025ETIW|5.0|For not letting punk/goth die. <br />I'm Not Okay first attracted me to this band.  Seldom has there been a punk anthem like this since Anarchy In the UK. <br />Helena: I want this played at my funeral. <br /> <br />The vocal and intrumentals are very complex for this style of music. Smartly, the lyrics are simple and easy to understand, without setteling into cliches, which balances this out. <br /> <br />Once a year, we actually get something good out of the music scene, like the White Stripes and the Dresden Dolls. <br /> <br />I will follow MCR where ever they take me... <br />
0316172324|2.0|Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements). <br /> <br />The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon. <br /> <br />There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it.
0671015206|5.0|This book is a breakthrough in its findings on wealth acumulation, millionaires' domestic lifestyle, and wealthy Americans' consumer habits.  The analysis is a result of over 15 years of data accumulation and academic analysis.<br /><br />I was first introduced to the book in 1999 when I had to read it as a required text for a Personal Finance class at the University of California at Davis.  The second read, years later, was just as fresh, enlightnening, and captivating as the first.  Now I own the book on CD (which is a truncated version of the book, unfortunatelly :-( )<br /><br />The two academic authors do an excellent job at condensing their study field and interview results, and outlining in clear English the traits of the wealthiest people in the US.  Each chapter talks about a different topic.  The topics range from how millionaires became such, to how they raise their kids, to what kind of cars they drive.  I was suprised to learn some cool and interesting facts.  For example, the most popular cars (inadvertently) are the ones with the lowest rate of cost per weight.<br /><br />I cannot sing this book's praises enough. This book deserves a 5+ stars.  Enjoy the read!<br /><br />Good job Danko and Stanley.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta consists of a few of the members of \\"At the Drive-In\\", so if you enjoy that band, most likely you won't this one...Why is that? Because they are two seperate bands with two very different sounds. If you can, why don't you listen to a few of the tracks from this album. It's a 70's psychedelic rocker's wet dream. Each song possesses both the longivity and \\"trippy\\" nuances classic rockers like Pink Floyd or the Doors would applaud. Mix that with vocals you might hear from \\"Coheed & Cambria\\" or any other band whose lead singer sounds like a chick, and the musical calamity might smell a bit like Mars Volta. My favorite track off this cd of theirs is track 3 \\"Via L'Viaquez\\". For those of you who are looking at the track settings now and are puzzled, trust me, track 3 is \\"Via L'Viaquez\\". I got the CD at home...it's Amazon that's wrong; I'm calling you out! Track 2 is nice, too. It's called \\"The Widow\\", not \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus: Unbilical Syllables\\"...that's completely wrong. \\"The Widow\\" has a nice soft blend of guitar and vocals, while \\"Via L'Viaquez\\" is half Spanish lyrics, the other half English. It starts out a quick tempo Spanish song, then slows way down to an almost \\"Tango\\" Spanish dance circulo type rhythm...it's so wonderful! Why don't you give it a try and buy it. The rest of the album is as superb...you'll love it, I already know it! Did I mention I'm a psychic...because I'm not. If you're cool, you will buy it.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I recently discovered Celtic Woman courtesy of my local PBS station that aired their performance that is already out on dvd. I just fell in love the mix of classical and celtic music. What really struck me was the clarity of the women's vocals were. Lisa, Chloe, Meav, and Orla sang with great restraint and did not go down the Celine Dion route and oversing each high note known to mankind. While I do think that Lisa and Meav has the strongest set of pipes, it does not mean that I think Chloe and Orla has thin, weak vocals. I just thought Lisa and Meav's vocals really stood out for me.<br /><br />My most personal favorite song on the album is the gorgeous ballad \\"Someday\\" from Disney's \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\". I was truly moved by Chloe's performance when I saw her sing it on the PBS special. That song along is why I bought this cd. It is a beautiful song that sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. Chloe also does a stunning job on \\"Walking in the Air\\". It is quite a contrast from the heavy metal version by Nightwish. Another favorite song is \\"Harry's Game\\" sung by Orla. Her vocals on this song also gives me the chills. I am so glad that \\"Si Do Mhaimeo i (The Wealthy Widow)\\" was included on the cd. It is one of my favorite songs from the PBS special. A very playful song. I wish I knew what the english translation were. Another favorite highlight for me on this album is their version of \\"You Raise Me Up\\". That really made the hair on my arms stand up tall. It really moved me emotionally, more so than Josh Groban's version. What I found rather interesting about the recorded version and the live version on the PBS special is that the recorded version sounded like it was sung strictly by Meav while the credits listed Meav, Lisa, Chloe and Orla. If you listened to this cd as much as I have (which is a few times a day), you can easily recognize Meav's delicate soprano vocals.<br /><br />I wish that the cd also included Enya's \\"Marble Halls\\" and Bach's \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\". They were simply breathtaking. Other than that, I loved this entire cd. There was not a single song that I didn't like or felt should have been left out. I look forward to hearing more music from the women of Celtic Woman.esiring\\". They were simply breathtaking. Other than that, I loved this entire cd.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Ah, The Mars Volta. They wrote this album while engaged in a heavy acid trip (true story), which is why it is so heavily concentrated on bizarre guitar riffs and superbly done drum and vocals. All the tracks are great. Listen to them while you are so mentally out of it or if you are sober, it really doesn't matter. It all sounds exoberant and is honestly one of my favorite CDs in my collection. By far a must have for fans and one no music lover should be without. It you buy it, listen to it, like it, then go out and buy their newest CD \\"Francis the Mute\\". It's just as good.
B000002L82|3.0|I will admit that, at the time of writing this review, Power Corruption, &amp; lies is the only New Order or Joy Division record I own. I admit to being ignorant of the history of this band.<br />However, my knowledge of the band does not change the fact that this record is, in a way, too consistent. The melodies almost repeat themsleves verbatim track after track, and the songs get boring fast because the songs rely heavily on them. There are a few standouts, like The Village, Leave Me Alone, and Blue Monday (CD version), but they are only temporary periods of excitement in an otherwise stagnant record. The lyrics are pretty good, that is the strong point of this album.<br />I gave this album three stars so that I can give in another chance.
B000067J1H|5.0|This movie is ground-breaking.  Edward Norton deserves an oscar for this movie.  Brad Pitt also gives a great performance.

I feel it is my duty as an educator to introduce excellent literature to my students.<br /><br />Laura Ingalls Wilder has captured a snapshot of the past for readers to enjoy for years to come. It's a fantastic way to introduce pioneers way of life and the hardships they endured.  My students especially like the small stories within the story; the stories that Pa tells about his family, his youth and what life was like when he was growing up.  Laura Ingalls Wilder truly does an excellent job describing what really is important in life; the simpler things we to often forget.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book, my favorite of the series.  If you have never read this book or it's been a long time since you have been in the `Little House' world.  I highly recommend reconnecting to a simper time and place.  My wife rereads the series once every year.<br /><br />In today's busy fast paced living, Laura Ingalls Wilder and her series reminds us of what really is important in our lives; our family, our friends and the love we share.<br /><br />Click, Order and be transported back to the past with Laura, Mary, Ma, Pa and Baby Carrie.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album finally shows Slipknots full range of talent. Unfortunately though, those who have no musical backround fail to see this. If you only listen to heavy metal, this album is probably not for you...but if you like MUSIC, you will not be disappointed. I get tired of listening to bands that play nothing but the same song over and over...i.e...Korn....and just give it a different title. Slipknot has shown it has more talent than that by trying new things. Keep it up!
B00005M989|5.0|this should really be titled \\"prince's best radio and chart reaching hits collection\\", because that is all that it is. nothing more, nothing less.  anybody who complains about what song is missing off of this release is basically missing the point.  this is a warner brothers hand-picked collection, not prince's, as he had no input to what should be constituted as 'the very best of...'.  he had already been freed from his contract at warner bros., so now warner has the fine job of milking off whatever money that they still can from this genius.  and, hey, this ain't that bad.  from his first real hit \\"i wanna be your lover\\", up until his last real hit for WB, \\"money don't matter 2nite\\", which peaked in the mid-20's on the charts early 1992,  this is the kind of release that you'll see stacked in any jukebox in any bar all over the country.  so relax, don't whine, just enjoy the sounds and have a damn great time.
B000001ELR|4.0|Time has been kind to 1982's \\"Creatures of the Night.\\" After the commercial failure that was \\"The Elder,\\" the band decided to take a back-to-basics approach, and apply a heavier sound. This would set the stage for the band's rebirth w/o makeup for their comeback album, \\"Lick it Up.\\"<br /><br />When the album originally came out in 1982, Ace Frehley had left the band and Vincent Cusano (Vinnie Vincent) took over on lead guitar. Yeah, Ace is on the cover, but no, he's not on the album. Nevertheless, it's still my favorite Kiss album cover. While \\"I Love it Loud\\" got airplay, it only peaked at #102 in the US. The album peaked at #45, then dropped of the charts with nary a whimper.<br /><br />It seems that fans redicovered how good this album was after Kiss started gaining a foothold again in the music industry in the mid-80's. After \\"Lick it Up,\\" \\"Animalize,\\" and \\"Asylum,\\" new fans began looking back for more and latched onto \\"Creatures\\" again.<br /><br />It ranks in the top five of my Kiss favorites (\\"Destroyer,\\" \\"The Elder,\\" \\"Dynasty,\\" \\"Rock & Roll Over,\\" \\"Creatures\\"). Much of that has to do with Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons having something to prove at the time. They were hungry again and had the desire to reestablish Kiss as a force in the music industry. It has since become a fan favorite as well as a favorite of the band's.
B000669GAI|5.0|Grunge is not dead.  Pearl Jam has outdone themselves again!  \\"rearviewmirror\\" from Pearl Jam tops the list when it comes to greatest hit colections.  Normally when you think of greatest hits you think of all the radio hits you can't stand to even hear one more time, but Pearl Jam has remixed some familiar tracks and reintroduced some tracks unknown to many, but much loved by die hard Pj fans.  I was anxiously awaiting this release, hoping to not be disappointed, and not only was I not disappointed, but i haven't taken this cd out of my stereo yet.  It covers all of the radio hits for a generic audience, but also manages to seduce already smitten fans with new remixes of songs like \\"Black\\" and \\"Alive.\\" One thing I enjoyed with the experience of relearning Pearl Jam was the fact the disc one is more hardcore, for times when i need a litte pump,and disc two slows down the tempo with more mellow tracks.  That's great for a girl like me who may have more moods than hours in a day.  Fortunately for me, Eddie Vedder and crew can always make me feel better.  Listening to a complex album like \\"rearviewmirrow\\" somehow sets me adrift and makes makes me feel that my life is not so complex.  The best part of all- you can take this trip for less than a 20.00
B00007LTIC|5.0|YES in high gear, and some bonus tracks. I loved \\"Going for the One\\" in a time when prog-rock stations were dying or going to the \\"underground.\\" Yep I remember a local Phoenix station playing the ENTIRE version of \\"Awaken.\\"! Times have changed. No more stadium rock, and sadly- no real bands to do it anyway that are young. <br /> Without Dream Theater, the genre would be almost dead. A few issues with \\"Going for the One-the Remaster.\\" I would like to see the extra's of this album randomly placed. A few of them are nice, and to hear Chris playing \\"Amazing Grace\\" would have been nice after \\"Awaken.\\" (I suppose one could always hit the : \\"random\\" button.) <br /> A superb representation of the band's last true great studio offering, despite the Keys sessions, which were torn into 2 albums. The remastering is best heard on the title track and \\"Awaken.\\" Steve Howe's guitar is toned down from it's noisiness on both tracks, and instead has a nice muffler effect, keeping it from sounding like he is just winging it loudly with abandon. In my opinion his solo on \\"Awaken\\" was his best since the live version of \\"Your's is no Disgrace\\" on Yessongs. <br /> Tremendous effort and class from the band that broke all the rules. God bless YES.
B000069AUI|3.0|I was not a fan of Coldplay until I heard Clocks. That song just did it for me, and made me want to hear more music from this group. After listening to this album in Circuit City, I decided to purchase it. It's a really enjoyable album. I particularly enjoy listening to it at night, because of the mellow, soothing mood it exhaults.  <br /> <br />I got curious about Coldplay after hearing artists like Brandy and Justin Timberlake praise them for their efforts, and now I see what all the hype was about. Brandy even sampled \\"Clocks\\" on her latest album Afrodisiac, and it really came out great. <br /> <br />The only thing I don't like about this album is that it only has eleven tracks. I know Coldplay has more in them than that. Other than that, it's a pretty good album. <br /> <br />AllStar's Favorite Tracks: <br />                          * Clocks <br />                          * Warning Sign <br />                          * Amsterdam

B00064MW6A|1.0|You know the old saying, \\"Do not change horses mid-race\\", well I think that heavily applies to this film.  I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer.  Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes.  Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was.  You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters.  I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film.  Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did.  There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat.  Catwoman was more than \\"just a cat\\", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish.  That is what never came through with Berry.<br /><br />Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film.  The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's \\"My cat's breath smells like cat food\\" moment.  I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible.  It would have granted this film one additional star more.  Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't.  What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work.  I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work.  All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past?  Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle.  There was no development here, just plain assumption.  I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.<br /><br />Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains.  Who were they?  What was their purpose behind their situations?  Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding?  I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister.  Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain?  Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time.  I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation.  It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3.  Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.<br /><br />The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom.  Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution.  There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is \\"ok\\" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere.  It was like bobbing for themes in this mess.  Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture.  It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character.  There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.  This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess.  I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it.  Not me, and that is how I felt with this film.  I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up.  It was pathetic.<br /><br />Overall, I was not happy with this film.  Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved.  With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big.  You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed.  I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result.  The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning.  This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters.  Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover.

B00002E23E|5.0|Some people may not find this DVD as capturing as I do, but if you're a true Zeppelin fan it's almost a must-have. The real genius of these musicians can be seen in this presentation. Four of the best at what they do in action. Yes,it has some faults but lets not forget that this was created back in the mid-70's & was an after-thought rather than a planned project. <br />If you have trouble staying awake through \\"Dazed\\" then you are not a true Zep fan, which is not a crime. Personally, it's one of my favorite tracks as it shows Page at his finest(best rock guitarist IMO). One may not care for the version of \\"Stairway <br />to Heaven\\" at 1st but it grows on you. If I had a gripe it would be that they didn't put the same tracks on the CD set as that are in the movie. Other than that, I can live with any other shortcomings one may point out.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|The title definitely fits the album's songs.  This album is pretty boring, especially by Kyuss and previous QOTSA standards.  There just doesn't seem to be any creativity in any of the songwriting.  In most of the songs, it's the same riff or lick over and over.  There are practically no bridges, tempo or melody changes in the course of any of the songs.  And there is really no edge to most of the songs.  They seem to just drone on.  Only Medication, Everybody Knows That You're Insane, and Tangled Up In Plaid save this album to some extent.  Overall, extremely weak.
0385335482|5.0|This book was really great.  It was hilarious!  HOWEVER, IT HAS SOME MATURE CONTENT.  So, anyway, it was a really great book, but there were some drawbacks.  1)So many of these events seemed unreal, such as the debate on the TV Show 2)Becky is very unrealistic, and very irrisponsible.  But, this is good in some ways it adds more funny-ness to her character 3)I thought this book would have more actual shopping in it, but she hardly goes on shopping sprees.  The first chapter is totally unlike the rest, and it gives a wrong idea about the book.  Becky doesn't look at any VISA bills and even the writing style is different.  All in all, this is a great, funny book any shopaholic (or not!) will enjoy!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I saw the pbs special and had to run out and get this cd.  The music is hauntingly beautiful.  Soothing, sweet.  15 year old Chloe is amazing.  I know I will listen to this cd everyday.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|The combination of Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone has surpassed all of my expectations.  This CD is constantly playing in my car and home, and even when it is not playing, I am replaying it in my head.  I truly can't hear it enough.  Ennio Morricone's music is just beautiful and Yo-Yo Ma just brings it all to life.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who treasures beautiful music.  <br /> <br /> <br />Mary Schaeffer <br />New Jersey
B0007OCG56|4.0|Not really knowing what this movie was about made me appreciate it more. Its well put together and surprisingly touching. Good acting mixed with a well thought out story just make this picture work.
B00080Z53O|5.0|this spanish film sadly tells the true story of a young sailor who while diving in the sea at his home suffers hoffific injuries, with the raging debate in the us at the moment this film examines a timely topic, his wish to die  (although he is still able to communicate) this film is a stunning acting performance by all involved, however some of the real facts have been airbrushed, firstly the scene with the quadreplegic priest is totally inaccurate (they met and had a v cordial convesation) also his sister in law is seen to be unsure about his wish to die (while in real life she was adamantly opposed) in fact everyone who supports his desire to die is seen to be smiling , understanding and intelligent, while those who are opposed are seen as ignorant , hostile and uncaring,  <br />the climax of this film is when he and his brother have a final conflict about his request, ramon tell his brother that his is a slave while his brother retorts that in fact he is the slave and has given his life to look after ramon, this in my opinion is real motivation  roman sampedro had for wanting to end his life( to ease his familys pain) sadly this argument is not examined in this film. <br />however despite these points this film is a mini masterpiece and will stay in your memory for along time
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" is an amazing musical loosley based on the shockingly wonderful, irrevrent 1995 novel by Gregory Maguire of the same title tells of the misunderstood Elphaba, who later becomes the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, originally portrayed in Baum's classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".  <br /> <br />The soundtrack is a pure adrenaline rush that is well put together.  While some of Schwartz's tracks are far too slow and sappy (the strangly out of place \\"Something Bad\\" and both of the sappy, boring songs sung by the Wizard), he exceedes his limitations by producing some emotional stirring numbers with include the show's anthem, \\"Defying Gravity\\" which is an amazing power ballad.  Other show stopping songs include \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"I'm Not that Girl\\" \\"No Good Deed\\" and \\"For Good.\\"  <br /> <br />And the soundtrack mainly owes its greatness to its amazing leading ladies. Kristen Chenoweth plays Glinda the Good Witch, and is portrayed more as a shallow, goody-goody cheerleader. Tony-winning Chenoweth shows amazing comic timing and exceptional pipes. Yet, the gold medal must go to Idina Menzel's moving portrayal of the young Elphaba (she won a Tony for her work in this play). Menzel is definatley given the majority of the well written songs in the play, and she uses her skills amazingly.  Her voice is unique and effortelss; a joy to listen to! <br /> <br />Overall, this is an extremly well done musical that is emotional moving and keeps you laughing right through (check out the tracks \\"What Is This Feeling?\\" and \\"Popular\\" for a good chuckle). You'll never look at the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" again after expirencing \\"Wicked\\"! <br /> <br />(DEFINATLEY read Magurie's novel if you have an intrest in the Broadway musical)
B000002LEE|5.0|This is one of the few albums I can say 'saved my life'. Any fellow audiophiles out there probably have a handful they can agree with me on, and this is one that sits in that bunch for me. It's an outrageously ballsy album that came completely out of left field in the 80's. To this day, it still pumps me up and gives me an adrenaline rush. Although I'd love to see the disc get a nice remastering to pick up the volume in the mix (a la 'Downward Spiral' for example), Perry and the boys never topped this disc as far as I am concerned. It's ambitious, obnoxious, controversial (on the cover alone, not to mention some of the lyrics), and amazing. This is one of of the all-time greatest heroin-fueled albums in rock history. Two thumbs way up.
6304535570|5.0|There are some who say that fans of Simon Templar should not see this film, but I say that Templar fans should make up their own minds. Some detractors accuse this Saint of being unrealistic and \\"corny\\", but fans of The Saint who dislike fictional escapism and \\"corny\\" entertainment should really find a new hero. There has always been a great deal of escapism and \\"corn\\" in The Saint canon, films, radio shows, comics, and TV shows. This Saint is certainly no worse, and in many ways is far superior, to other later day Saints like Ian Ogilvy or Simon Dutton. They each had their strong points, but Val Kilmer's Templar is by far a more intriguing character. I have very little knowledge of Val Kilmer's other work, but he's engaging and entertaining in this role. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that the origin of the character is revealed for the first time. Some have said this only takes place at the start of the film, but in reality the entire film IS the origin. It includes Simon's journey from criminal to Saint. His transformation, and three \\"miracles\\", kept me hooked from start to finish.  All Simon Templar fans should give this one another look. This Saint is a damn good picture worth seeing.
B0000029DD|5.0|I could go on and on about this disc, but I'll keep it short. Do yourself the favor, and if this is the only disc you buy in 2005, go out and buy it now. Jeff was a blessing to the music industry, and he had so much to offer. His voice, his guitar-playing, this disc is mind-blowing. You'll be hard-pressed to ever find another disc strike you the way this will.
B00008RV1L|3.0|This movie gets better everytime I see it. I really think I love this movie. As far as the DVD goes, the features such as the interviews and trailers were okay. I was frustrated that this movie was missing commentaries. It really could have used a commentary. I think it would have been awesome if they would have had a commentary with Mary Harron, Christian Bale and Bret Easton Ellis. That would be worth buying the DVD for; but it doesn't and it looks like I'll be holding out for the special edition if they decide to release one. Over all, movie is good with great replay value. DVD is okay.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Give it up for the 'stoner rock' kings (or should I say \\"queens'?) again. Not the sonic attack that 'Songs for the Deaf' was, but \\"Lullabies\\" is another masterpiece. Although I have to admit I miss the presence of Dave Grohl on this record more than Nick Olivieri (hope Nick records with them again, though), I was pleasantly surprised at how great this album is. Worth the wait and the best 'heavy' album I've heard so far this year.
B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album the Beatles recorded together and so listening to it never fails to stir emotions in me if just for that reason alone. After the slightly erratic \\"White Album\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" and the unhappy sessions that produced them, \\"Abbey Road\\" comes in like a breath of fresh air. Oddly enough then, several songs on \\"Abbey Road\\" were actually written at the same time songs on the \\"White Album\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" were penned, so maybe it's the clearly evident enthusiasm of all four band members on this album that makes it sound so fresh, as though the group somehow knew it would be their last time together and thus gave it their all so as to go out on a high. You really sense that this was a very happy record to make after the tension-induced sessions of their two previous albums.<br /><br />George's songwriting had been showing real significant signs of maturity in the two or three years prior to \\"Abbey Road\\", particularly with the penning of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" on the \\"White Album\\", but on \\"Abbey Road\\" George actually manages to equal any of the contributions made by those colossal songwriting peers of his, Lennon and McCartney, in terms of craftsmanship. \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" are two of the finest songs to be found anywhere in the entire Beatles' song catalog. 1969 and 1970 were probably George's strongest years for songwriting, with \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" being another real gem and the incredible solo album, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" finally fully showcasing George's talents devoid of the shadow of Lennon and McCartney. That's not to say John and Paul were resting on their laurels at this point in time. In fact, the music here is very often on par with that on \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". The Beatles' keep rocking literally until the very end with such great rock tracks as \\"Come Together\\", \\"Oh! Darling\\", \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"The End\\". The multi-layered three-part harmonies by George, Paul and John on \\"Because\\" are breathtaking, Ringo's hand at songwriting is merit-worthy with \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and the two connected song medley's that complete the album are just fantastic, both containing brilliant songs who's charm has been enhanced by the fact that they are kept short and form part of a medley. Just as you are thoroughly absorbed by one song, you're immediately taken into another terrific gem. Ever since I discovered \\"Her Majesty\\" was originally intended to run between \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\", I can't help but think the first medley might have sounded even better if it had been included, although it is still a nice surprise to find it there unannounced at the end of the album, although the CD does list it as the final track, in which case you can alternatively look to the unannounced segment of conversation that appears at the very end of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". To my knowledge, this makes the Beatles the first band to use \\"hidden\\" tracks on their albums.<br /><br />Paul's \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is the highlight of the album for me, and one of my all-time favorite songs. The beautiful introduction and melody of the first few verses really strike a sad chord that the end is nigh for the Beatles as a working group, but the uplifting change of melody and tempo partway through the song is typical of the Beatles' constant optimism, and in keeping with the times.<br /><br />Somehow, this album feels more like a celebration. A celebration of the 1960's and of the Beatles' themselves, with both about to dissolve forever, but having already firmly secured a place for themselves in the history books.are breathtaking, Ringo's hand at songwriting is merit-worthy with \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and the two connected song medley's that complete the album are just fantastic, both containing brilliant songs who's charm has been enhanced by the fact that they are kept short and form part of a medley.

B000002L9J|5.0|This is another disc that truly changed my life. Had they only recorded the song \\"I know It's Over\\" on this disc, it would have sat high on a list for me regardless. But this disc is fantastic. Morrissey and Marr were on a roll (they rarely made a bad song anyway), and this disc epitomized their genius at the time. One of the greatest albums of the 80's, and time will show (as it has begun to so far) that people will be coming back to this disc for years to come. Incredible.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I am reluctant to give too much praise to this album. Simply because a lot of it sounds like progressive rock to me. However, there also is that unique sound that makes PMG  such an inspirational group -(if you have the patience to listen through the artistic pretentions and the distorted guitar.)
B0007NFL18|1.0|this has got to be the most overplayed and most annoying piece of trash i've ever heard. i wouldn't recommend this $h!t to anyone. i feel sorry for who ever wasted there money on this crap. just like jadakiss said it's gonna end up as a weed plate. DON'T BUY IT!!
B00022LRXA|4.0|The last in Eno's series of quirky, unique albums from the 70's before he moved totally into ambient music and expored his \\"rock\\" side only through production of other artists.<br /><br />Like the titles that came before, Before and After Science finds Eno stringing together a series of offbeat numbers ranging from rock to pop to ambient and everything in between.  This record was sequenced with most of the more ambient numbers at the end, unlike Another Green World's free admixture of styles.  I personally liked the AGW way better, but fortunately we have the option these days of programming the songs in any order we want, so problem solved.<br /><br />Eno's star-studded array of collaborators had become as legendary as his skewed sense of pop by this point, with everyone from Phil Manzanera to Phil Collins to Robert Fripp sitting in on this one.  They were Eno veterans, but Eno's concurrent interest in German art-rock brings Can's Jaki Liebzeit and Moebius and Roedelius from Cluster to the table on Before and After Science.<br /><br />My favourite moments:  The atmospheric but too-short \\"Energy Fools the Magician\\" with the Brand X rhythm section of Percy Jones and Collins, with Fred Frith.  The frantic new wave single \\"King's Lead Hat\\" (an anagram of Talking Heads) with Fripp.  And all of the old \\"side 2\\" especially the beautiful \\"By This River\\" with Cluster.  The piano has haunted me since I first heard it way-back-when, and I enjoy playing it myself.  The closing \\"Spider and I\\" summons up a massive wall of synths-n-bass, and Eno's resigned vocal is quite fitting as he was about to leave the rock world (as a performer) for a very, very long time.<br /><br />I have the earlier CD edition and to tell you the truth I don't notice anything radically different about the remaster, so the cheaper original CD might be a good bargain unless you're a real audiophile.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The firt time I saw the preview for the Phantom of the Opera, I thought it looked a bit too \\"opera-ish\\" and flamboyant for me.  But I broke down when a friend of mine begged and begged and begged me to go, with the additional pushing of my mom.  Walking into the theater, I was a bit afraid I had blown eight dollars on a movie I was certain I wouldn't like.  Yet when the end credits began to roll, I found myself grinning from ear to ear, singing along with my friends to Masquerade!  What a simply beautiful movie!  I was pleased with most of the acting; Raoul seemed like he could've had more emotion, but Gerard and Emmy did a marvelous job and had great chemistry.  Minnie Driver made me laugh out loud with her vivacious accent and drama queen persona.  Not to mention having dashing Mr. Butler as the Phantom certainly made you more biased towards Raoul;).  The sets were gorgeous, especially the scene of the Masquerade, I loved all the dancing and interesting costumes.  As for the songs, I found myself humming them for weeks after I saw the movie (twice!).  When I finally broke down and bought the soundtrack, they became permamently engraved into my brain!  Very hard to stop singing the beautiful lyrics to Music of the Night.  Of course, no one can deny the wonderful talents of Michael Crawford.  I am a big fan of the original Broadway soundtrack.  But for a movie adaptation, it blew me away.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Tom Cruise was very interesting to watch in a real bad guy role, but the movie just didn't keep up with him.  The chance occurrence regarding two random fares in a taxi winding up having very much to do with each other is ridiculous.  Having the taxi driver pretend to be a hit man and getting away with it was another incident that left credibility behind, as well as the insertion of the mother into the film.  This film was an excuse to portray Tom Cruise in a particularly nasty role, but that was just not enough of a reason to sit through it, at least not for me . .
0345446798|3.0|This book provides some interesting information about the innate differences in the ways dogs and humans communicate. It is not a training book, nor is it very useful for the dog owner seeking lots of practical advice. It's an interesting read for someone who likes dogs and wonders what might be going on inside their heads as compared to ours.    The author focuses a great deal on how dogs naturally behave, which is useful for dealing with the many untrained or poorly trained dogs out there. There are also some touching stories of the author's own dogs and some of the animals that she has worked with.    Unfortunately, the author does a poor job of giving dog owners any practical advice on training or dealing effectively with a problem dog.
B00005JN0T|2.0|This movie could have been more than it was.  The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process  . . .  This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up.  Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself.
B00028HBKM|5.0|One observation that can almost be stated as fact - whenever the subject of Jesus is addressed in film and in virtually all art forms, for that matter, there is sure to be some sort of accompanying controversy that goes along with the artist's individual statement.  There are many who are and were against \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" because of all of the anti-Semitic hype generated before the film's release.  Many were opposed to its graphic violence.  Some were opposed to Mel Gibson's deviations from the Gospels in his decision to incorporate non-Biblical sources and artistic license to fill in some of the gaps in narrative.  Unfortunately, many find it difficult to get past some of these controversies and preconceptions to fully begin to appreciate and respect the film for its message and its purpose.  Mel Gibson set out to give us a very real and vivid telling of the Passion narrative - one that will serve as a visual context into which to place these events from Jesus' life.  Unfortunately, many of the previous Hollywood treatments of Jesus (there are a few exceptions of course) have made him a very inaccessible person - emphasizing the divine nature rather than man.  Jesus was a very real person, a man who experienced every emotion, feeling, & temptation that every human has and will.    The Jesus in \\"The Passion\\" is both divine and a very real man, a man that we see being put to the test - both in spiritual and physical terms.  He is a man who faces up to the temptations of the devil and his own fears of His Father's abandonment to accomplish his mission.   I believe that the realistic violence depicted in the film is truly necessary and essential to fully understand and convey the impact of the sacrifice Jesus has made for us.  After all, Roman capitol punishment was very real, brutal and barbaric in its nature.   <br /> <br />Although \\"The Passion\\" is more of a spiritual experience rather than a cinematic one for me, aesthetically, the film itself is very well made and wonderful to look at.  The cinematography is beautiful, as are the costumes and set design.  The acting is very top notch and convincing.  I especially admire Maia Morgenstern's moving depiction of the Virgin Mary and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Christ.  The part of Jesus, as written in the context of this film, really necessitates more of a non-verbal and physical presence in the role which I believe Jim Caviezel fulfills perfectly.  I truly respect his spiritual and physical dedication to the title role.   <br /> <br />There are many images in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" that I will never forget - nor will I ever want to.  For me, these images will always serve as a visual reminder of these events to ponder while reflecting on the Passion of Jesus Christ.  I hope that once the hype and controversy around this film subside as the years pass, viewers will appreciate the true message of the film and have that message enrich their spirituality after watching it. I tip my hat to Mel Gibson for having the conviction to take on such a project and to not compromise his vision in the process.  <br />
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I am often in the minority in my view of this, but I feel \\"Counterparts\\" is the Rush masterpiece of the '90s, and may well be their best album.  I've often heard of it referred to as Rush's stab at alternative, which I really don't agree with either-- certainly, the band was influenced by a return of guitar-based rock music to the forefront of popular consciousness, and no doubt that assisted in this album fully embracing the guitar as main driver behind the music, but this is the direction the band had been heading for the past several albums-- after the synth wash of \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" and \\"Power Windows\\", \\"Hold Your Fire\\", \\"Presto\\", and \\"Roll the Bones\\" all walked the path of guitar based performance.  What may have been more alternative influenced on this record was the focus on rock rhythms rather than the budding focus on funk and even hip hop rhythms that was so present on \\"Roll the Bones\\".    As a result of this sonic shift, this album features some of the most inspired playing by guitarist Alex Lifeson in a long time-- Geddy Lee's bass, so often the most interesting component in Rush material on the past few albums, moved into a more traditional rock roll, freeing Lifeson to fill space better (mind you, Geddy Lee still has one of the most distinctive voices on the bass guitar in rock music, and is instantly recognizable).  I also find that Lee's singing is superlative, perhaps the best he's done-- his confidence as a vocalist allows him full control over his range and he fills each song with an investment of emotion I don't feel we'd heard from him in the past.  Lyrically, the album also continues the evolution of previous records-- Neil Peart's early albums were fantasy/science fiction influenced, often allegorical or parable.  As time wore on, he brought his lyrics into a more modern society, into the current view.  The past few Rush albums began to show a trend of lyrics with a much more personal bent, this album continues that trend-- themes largelyof love and relationship dominate the album, and even the more globally minded songs (\\"Nobody's Hero\\") have a personal slant to the lyrics.    To talk a bit about the songs themselves, there really is a wealth of stunning material here.  The rolling, jangly opener, \\"Animate\\", with its synth soaked bridge, stands out as one of the best cuts on the album, ditto for instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\", which musically manages to portray a haunting, tense feel.    Beyond these two, the album seeks several directions, easily viewed in its thematic content-- the two I mentioned previously fit in with a sort of struggle in relationships theme that's all ofver the album, including the great, driven \\"Cut to the Chase\\" (with another stunning Lifeson guitar solo), \\"Alien Shore\\", lyrically an explosion of metaphor, musically its funky in a way much of the material on the last album was, and one of the album's singles, \\"Cold Fire\\", a bitter love song with clever word play (how can you not love a love song with the line \\"she said, 'this is not a love song'\\") and a sufficiently affected vocal delivery by Lee.    There's also definitely an undercurrent of sort Whitmanesque uplifting of the everyday people, the single \\"Nobody's Hero\\", reflecting on how the death of a loved one means everything to some but nothing to most, and the fairly obvious message of \\"Everyday Glory\\", the latter a powerful, swelling song, again with a great vocal by Lee.    Finally, there's a handful of experimental songs-- Rush seeking new directions continuously stabs out in a number of ways-- \\"Stick It Out\\", with its overt guitar (and great bass playing in its bridge) doesn't quite succeed as well as you'd hope, nor does the straightahead \\"Speed of Love\\".  The funkier songs on the record though, the unique \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" (with great lyrical word play and a monster riffing) churns and chugs and spins and explodes in its chorus, one of the great, overlooked Rush songs, and one of Peart's cleverist moments as a lyricists, and the bizarre, funky, bass-driven \\"Double Agent\\", with its strange spoken word vocal, as the peak of '90s Rush experimentalism, it does far better than expected.    Overall, this is a great album, with a lot of varied, intriguing, and successful material.  Experimentation abounds, and Rush does well with it.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|4.0|When I set out to watch this film, there were two questions in my mind: How am I going to react to the change of director? and Will Michael Gambon be able to replace Richard Harris in the role of Dumbledore? In terms of the director, I noticed that Alfonso Cuaron was able to capture the essence of the direction in which the series is moving. As the story progressed in the novels, we found ourselves reading about darker events and experiencing an ambiance that is filled with danger and dread. In the movie Cuaron starts incorporating elements that suggest this, including the illumination used when shooting the different scenes. As to the second question, Gambon does a good job as Hogwarts' headmaster, but we are going to have to understand that Harris cannot be replaced, and that we settle for the alternative.<br /><br />It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and things start out bad when he leaves the house of his uncle after an argument, in a furious state, and ends up in a very special bus in which he learns about the existence of Sirius Black. Sirius is a dangerous criminal that was jailed in Azkaban for aiding Voldemort - excuse me, You-Know-Who - and who has recently escaped. When Harry arrives at the Weasley's house, he finds out that things are even worse than they look, because Sirius is expected to come after Harry in order to kill him, and in that way eliminate the bigger obstacle in Voldemort's path back to power and glory.<br /><br />As a result of these events, Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementors, which are abominable creatures that act as guards of Azkaban, and whose power resides in the fact that they feed on fear and drive people mad. Some things in the school have not changed though, Hagrid is still there, and he is now teaching one of the classes; Malfoy and his friends are still in the prowl for trouble, and Hermione keeps studying like crazy. There are some new characters though, for example Emma Thompson plays to perfection the role of Professor Sybil Trelawney, the divination instructor, and Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, is the chosen one to play Sirius.<br /><br />The kids playing the roles of Harry and his friends continue to show improvement as the series of movies progresses, delivering more convincing and relaxed performances. The special effects are praiseworthy once again, and I particularly liked the way in which they created Buckbeak, the hippogriff. One of the few aspects that I did not like was the costumes, since the students wore jeans most of the movie, instead of the traditional cloaks in which we are used to seeing them in. Regarding the extras, the DVDs include a myriad of these, from deleted scenes to interviews with the protagonists. I especially liked the fact that the extras include the trailers for all three movies, since it was nice to remember the highlights of the previous ones. In my opinion, Potter fans will not be disappointed with this film, and will certainly be looking forward to the fourth one.the divination instructor, and Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, is the chosen one to play Sirius.

B0007QJ1N4|4.0|Although it doesn't come out of the corner swinging like \\"R\\" and \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" it's a long round fighter so to speak, the longer you listen to it the more it knocks you out.  Queens of the Stone age are one of those bands that has staying power, even after losing one of the founding members, Joshua Homme shows that he still has the touch.  I recommend this cd to anyone who likes this style of music.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Lets see, another CD by Avril Lavigne, the \\"Anti Brittany\\".  Everybody thinks she is more talented than Brittany Spears, but when you listen to these singers, Brittany Spears definately has the best voice of the two.  Now, saying Brittany has a better voice than Avril Lavigne isn't much of a compliment, since even Marge Simpson has a better voice than Avril Lavigne, but if I had to choose between these two pop stars, I'd choose Brittany, no question. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, I've never been a fan of manufactured pop, but the manufactured pop of Brittany Spears is much easier on the ears than the screaming anger rock of Avril Lavigne.  This music is LOUD.  Loud, loud, loud.  Avril Lavigne's voice is harsh, screechy, and annoying.  She sounds like a cat with its balls caught in a vice.  How anybody could consider the raging screams of a whiney teenager \\"music\\" I'll never know.  Avril Lavigne's fans probably think gang graffiti is more attractive than a Leonardo DaVinci masterpiece, and that a trailer park is more beautiful than the Taj Mahal.  I bet these people probably think a stagnant pool of water is more spectacular than Angel Falls!  Such is the taste of anybody that thinks a bratty suburban delinquint screaming at the top of her lungs is \\"music\\". <br /> <br />If you insist on listening to prefab pop, at least listen to someone who can carry a tune without everyone in the room going deaf.  Kelly Clarkson, Christina Agulira, Celine Dion, Laura Branigan...ANYBODY but Avril!
1577311523|4.0|I found the book inspiring, mainly because its ideas seem to \\"work\\" in the sense that I feel peace when applying them. I practive yoga and some meditation, and I find that any tool that causes me to think in the present moment(not escape the feelings, but be aware of them) helps me \\"feel\\" peace. I don't think any book is a silver bullet, and perhaps others read with expectations of \\"enlightenment\\". It is an awareness, a tool, to be used and practiced over a lifetime.  <br /> <br />Throughout the book, as a Christian often meditating on the words of Jesus, I found myself comparing the points of view to Jesus' words and trying to find the common threads (of which I think there are several). That is an interesting exercise and I feel helps me to understand and develop faith, although it poses many unanswered questions. No one author has all the answers, but perhaps it is not meant to be that way.    <br /> <br />I have read the netagive & positive reviews here on Amazon. I can't say that I understand much of the complaints of those who didn't like the book. Perhaps I am not as advanced in my understanding or learning as they are, and maybe in their path they have need of more substance, I don't know. One reviewer mentions inaccuracies related to the \\"now\\" as defined by teachings of \\"mystics\\"..frankly I would not advise a spiritual seeker to put too much emphasis on such complexity...at least if they are at my (maybe early?) stage on the path.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale is Trevor Reznik. His performance as a deathly thin insomniac machinist is so unerring perfect it's disturbing. He is the character in every way. By now it's well known he dropped down to an unhealthy 117 lbs for the role (though the movie says he weighs 119, he admitted afterward that he actually weighed less). Throughout the film Trevor is tormented by Ivan, a man no one else can see. Bizarre, horrific things are happening all around Trevor and he believes Ivan is responsible for it.<br /><br />If you liked Se7en and Fight Club, you'll probably like The Machinist. It's a rather simpler story, but the style is very similar, even in terms of cinematograpy (it's directed by Brad Anderson, not David Fincher), though the execution may be even better. Perhaps because the movie is smaller in scope than either aforementioned films, the story is more coherent and when it's over, more conclusive and satisfying (partly because Fight Club did not use the book's original ending). Even more so than Fight Club, the ending is surprising, though you'll wonder why you didn't see it right in front of you the entire time. The Machinist is an intelligent, clever take on what could have been a predictable, cliche mess. Highly recommended.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|Having seen trailers of both the Bridget Jones films in theaters (and being grateful at not having spent the theater price for this duo), renting the DVD was for one reason only: could these films be as bad as they appeared in trailer or was there really a reason they were successful?<br /><br />When a cast of the order including Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Hugh Grant,  Colin Firth, Renee Zellweger, and Jacinda Barrett, there must be a reason for this group to consent to participate in this mindless mess.  Money, I suppose, because there doesn't appear to be another reason.  The script is poor at best, the 'fat actress' concept and poor accent that besiege Renee Zellweger's attempt to create a credible comic character is ludicrous, and the obvious big budget/multi-location squandering of production costs is shameful.  Sad that there is an audience for this type of film.  Maybe others can be entertained by this escapist route, but the smarmy digs at characters embedded in lesbian or Thai prisoner roles etc are in poor taste and definitely not funny.<br /><br />Let's hope there are no plans for the further lack-of-adventures of this fatuous Bridget Jones idea.  Grady Harp, March 05
0385510438|3.0|I do believe that Grisham captures the mood and times of the Deep South. I do believe that he constructed a suspenseful plot, but had trouble staying on track. I also believe that this is not a high-tension legal thriller, and that the focus of the story isn't primarily on the legal case. The story is more about racism and the growth of a newspaper editor, then a trial. This is a heartwarming story about a young adult friendship with the last juror, which is exactly why I don't like it. The title implies that the book will be a suspenseful mystery thriller. Well, the story did not live up to the title. <br />Grisham seems to divert the readers attention away from the plot far too often by going into lengthy descriptions of food, when he should be following the path he already paved by describing the trial, the jurors who are showing up dead, and the Padgitt family. You should read this book if you want to read about southern cooking, perhaps if you are looking for ideas for thanksgiving dinner, but not if you are looking for a good high-tension legal thriller. Grisham is a very well respected author of thriller novels, and I am very disappointed in him in the aspect that he would mislead the reader into thinking that this was another one of his mystery novels. Grisham's \\"mystery legal thriller\\" novel eventually turns into a documentary about oppressed African Americans in 1970s and a documentary of Miss Callie's recipes. Maybe John Grisham was hungry while writing this novel? <br />
1400032717|5.0|I am not a big reader.  I purchased this book for something to read on a long plane flight.  After recently reading \\"The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", it seemed that another story of one's mind may be interesting.  And was it.  From the moment I opened the book I could not put it down.  Not only was I captivated by the thoughts of this kid, but had a growing appreciation for the challenges someone with this condition has, page by page.  The story was written in a light and easy reading way, where I just flew through the pages.  It was humorous at times, and at times felt deep compasion for Christopher.  Have to give this 5 stars as one of the best books I have read.
0425152251|2.0|I have serious problems with this book, which was recommended to me by many people, of whose opinions I am now in doubt.  The book serves its purpose well, to educate fiction-readers about the history of philosophy, increase our sense of wonder about the world, etc.  However, the book has no sense of wonder for its own characters, its plot, or its literary choices.  The novel is not written well at all and there is little if any character development.  It's a poorly-masked attempt to increase the points of access for philosophy, but the voice of the main character is oversimplified and insults the reader's intelligence.  This book actually made me enjoy philosophy even less than I already do, though it did succeed in answering the question of why we continue to study it at all.  Still, the writing is awful.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|A lot has been said about \\"Francis the Mute.\\"  Good and bad.  But never indifferent.  \\"Francis\\" evokes polarity.  I love that.  It's a challenging record to say the least.  From my perspective, it's one of the best collections of music I've ever heard.  \\"De Loused\\" is great, but it doesn't touch the creativity and scope of \\"Francis.\\" <br /> <br />So far, \\"Francis\\" is the best record of the year.
B0007NFL18|3.0|Get Rich or Die Tryin' was excellent. I loved every song. It was a great album. My least favorite song was In Da Club, and the singles released for The Massacre have that same commercial and poppy edge. I had a feeling The Massacre was going to disappoint me, but I bought it anyway. I love 50 and G-Unit, so I listened to the CD, and it was alright.  But it doesn't come close to GRODT. So if you compare The Massacre to GRODT, its completely awful. So if this was anyone else, this CD would be good. Not great, but good. But this happens to be 50, and this album happens to suck.   <br /> <br />The Best 3: <br />8. Outta Control <br />9. Get In My Car <br />22. Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit Remix) <br />
0743454529|5.0|Never before has a book elicited such intense feelings and heated discussion in my book club. We either admired the courage of the main adult female character or hated the neglect of select family members by her. It seems to me that individuals who have had an easy life could not empathize with a woman who gave her all to her one child, a girl diagnosed with a fatal & rare form of leukemia at age 3. Many found it unconscionable that she gave birth to another child with the desire to save her ill daughter with the blood from the fetal cord. Those of us who have had sick children and know that it puts a family in crisis and that frequently the illness takes as big a toll on the \\"healthy\\" family members were sympathetic, whereas the most vocal negative comments came from individuals who had not experienced long term family crisis. This book tugs at your heartstrings and is a must read for your book club groups......schedule extra time for discussion!
0553212621|5.0|I had always been under the impression that this book was written long, long, LONG ago.  Even though it was written in the past with many other societal influences that actually deemed it inappopriate for the US market, almost every single word and ideal still applies, and so profoundly applies!  We need every young man and woman, every politician, every puritanical joker or influence on social law to read this.<br /><br />D.H. Lawrence was a man ahead of his time.  He had it all figured out: the difficulties and attraction between men and women, the differences between love and sex, the differences between the classes and cultures, and the how and why of our everyday human afflictions that plague us from childhood on.  So many views and ideals are inserted into the text that I can't begin to list them, but they're all incredibly important.  If only we, as modern generations, could read, consider, and adapt these principles and understandings.  The world would truly be a different place.<br /><br />Lawrence gives me new faith in the genre of fiction itself.  Never have I seen so much taught in a single made-up volume since reading Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  Lady Chatterley's Lover is a work that touches upon and attempts to free of us of all our associated qualms from freedom of speech and sexual expression to the institution of marriage and judgment of others.<br /><br />I agree with authors of erotica and advocates of sexual freedom who promote this book as a must-read, but must also add it to the list of must-reads for the entire population.  It's not just about love and sex, but about life, being true to yourself, and relating to your fellow man.
B000002KBU|5.0|32 years ago I was sitting on a beach with a girl and she said to me \\"There is a line in a song that goes 'Just before our love got lost, you said \\"I am as constant as the northern star\\" and I said, \\"Constantly in the darkness.  Where's that at!  If you want me I'll be in the bar.\\" And I was hooked!  I listened to the album (\\"Blue\\") and it has followed me through my life - as an anthem - a paean of the sweetest poetry - a melody to life.  My youngest daughter heard it some years ago and now Blue has become her companion.  This is unrepeated beauty and the sweetest companion in love and sadness. Mitchell has done a lot of great stuff since but nothing that quite matches the exquisite emotional subtelty of this musical masterpiece.  Give it a try. If you have the ear you won't regret it.  If not, that's ok.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I love dragons have since I was a kid so when this came out I was very interested. Then like an idiot for one of the few times in my life I listened to the critics and didn't go. <br />What a moron! This film was quite good, I rented it, and was surprised that folks had such a negative reaction to it. <br />I love that it is a sort of post apocalypse type film but no bombs no viruses just dragons. <br />It was great, very dark and gritty with the real feel of what the world would be like if fire breathing monsters like dragons roamed the earth. <br />And the ending was great I loved how they did this whole picture it made sense and was very enjoyable. <br />The critics be damned, I'm done with all of them!
B000001YOW|5.0|I think I misunderstood what art rock meant, or could mean, until I listened to Porcupine Tree.  While art rock may call to mind groups like Yes, King Crimson, the Moody Blues and other early progressive rock groups, there was a certain pretension and bombast to their work that often made you wonder whether the heavy music was overdone just to show you how awesome rock music could be (I love these groups, by the way).  Porcupine Tree has some music that approaches bombast, and yet their focus is on the art of music.  Through more than a decade of sculpting music they have yet to succumb to the dark side of rock (commercialism), keeping true to their musical vision in spite of mediocre sales.<br /><br />\\"Signify\\" is somewhat different from the two previous Porcupine Tree CDs I have reviewed, the incredible \\"In Absentia\\" and the excellent \\"The Sky Moves Sideways.\\"  The latter album is focused on psychedelic instrumentals; vocals, though infrequently used, are well done.  The former album I consider to be one of the best rock albums I have ever heard, and the best progressive rock album I have ever heard.  \\"Signify\\" seems to be a combination of genres, with more standard rock elements than either of these two albums, yet combining highly surreal poetry with the music.  There are still sufficient musically interesting elements for most progressive rock fans, but only four of the twelve tracks are beyond six minutes.  One should not be misled by the length, however, as some tracks feed the next track.<br /><br />This CD opens with \\"Bornlivedie,\\" an instrumental track with a voiceover that invites you to sit back and enjoy the music.  This artistic track ends with the word, `signify,' before launching into a rock instrumental with synthesizers and mellotron helping expand the musical scope of the guitars and drums.<br /><br />\\"Sleep of no Dreaming\\" is the first song, and the music has a hard bite to it to match the heavily poetic and psychedelic lyrics.  I would provide a sample of the lyrics, but a portion here would be to short-change the true effect of all the lyrics.  The closest I can come to giving a reference are some of the more bizarre lyrics of Tool, and even that is a woefully inadequate description.  \\"Pagan\\" is another instrumental that feels somewhat dreamlike with samples, synthesizers and drums.<br /><br />The next two tracks are linked.  \\"Waiting Phase One\\" is a gloomy song about some of the worst things that life has to offer, depression, drugs, and pain.  The music has an almost pop-like flavor, and could be pop but for the topic.  \\"Waiting Phase Two\\" is the fourth instrumental and the longest yet on this CD, with two even longer instrumentals to come.  True to form, Richard Barbieri's phenomenal synthesizer skill unites the samples, pianos, guitars and percussion to form a track that is interesting and challenging, and yet not so esoteric that it becomes inaccessible to a casual listener, which might also be said of the other instrumentals on this CD.<br /><br />The following track starts off with interesting vocal effects before launching into incomprehensible lyrics that may push beyond avant garde.  The lyrics of \\"Sever\\" transcend poetry as they are a juxtaposition of images that hint at a unifying theme without immediately revelation.  This song contains elements that would be exploited more fully in \\"In Absentia,\\" particularly the lush harmonies alternating with a more dramatic vocal style.  This track is one of the best on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Prayer\\" begins as a two-layered instrumental.  In the background are a variety of electronica that provides the backdrop for programmed drums.  There is a spoken part that I can hear only partially, with only the \\"please help\\" standing out.  The instrumental finishes enthusiastically with a more traditional rock beat standing out from the electronic effects.  This instrumental is nothing special, just very good music for listening.<br /><br />Another of the better tracks on this CD is \\"Every Home Is Wired.\\"  My preference for the style of music that would be on \\"In Absentia\\" is obvious, as this song has that style, though with far more surreal lyrics.  This song is relatively unique on this CD as it is the only one that is similar to the style of Yes.  The vocals multi-layered harmonies, with numerous overdubs, and the result is excellent.  The last two minutes of this song features an eerie assortment of electronic effects that may invite comparison to science fiction movie sound effects of the 50s and 60s.<br /><br />Two instrumentals follow that are related at least by title, \\"Intermediate Jesus\\" and \\"`Light Mass Prayers.'\\"  The first instrumental features a heavy and somber sound with occasional vocals by an evangelical type person.  This instrumental may have been a musical commentary on the heavy-handed way in which some religions deal with people and problems.  The second instrumental is in sharp contrast to the first in that it is very meditative.  The effects are mellow and harmonious, and somewhat in contrast with much of the rest of this CD.  However, given the breadth of the music included on any Porcupine Tree CD, the scope this instrumental adds is consistent.<br /><br />The last instrumental flows smoothly into \\"Dark Matter.\\"  This song could be interpreted in so many ways.  The ephemeral nature of life and fame are subtly, and poetically, suggested.  The song may also be a partial condemnation of the coverage and momentary fame our society, exemplified by the media, gives violent criminals.  This song is well crafted and yet another excellent track.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree has impressed me with each of the three CDs I have heard.  I plan to get them all.

B00008ADPF|1.0|I want all of you so blinded by your own ignorance to throw this album AWAY.  Cast it off of a casm, destroy it as quickly as you can...because this type of music epitomizes what is so wrong and souless with modern music, movies, and popular culture.  This is yet another band that has been manufactured (i'm aware they were some sort of \\"real\\" rock band prior to getting a record deal, but that's beside the point) by a label into churning out totally insipid, formulaic and safe music that the clueless masses will eat right up.  All that said, they clearly have little if any talent.  So, to FREE yourself from years potentially wasted listening to \\"music\\" such as this (Simple Plan, Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, etc), download or buy yourself some music with real feeling, creativity, originality and lasting power:   <br /> <br />Radiohead, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, Bob Marley, Neil Young, Curtis Mayfield, The Doors, Herbie Hancock, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, My Bloody Valentine, Ravi Shankar... <br /> <br />These artists and many others are the TRUE luminaries.  Yes, music taste is objective...but just try any of these artists and stop being confined to single genres and unchallenging bands. <br /> <br />PLEASE...it's for your and everyone else's own good.

B00028HBKM|5.0|What I found was that I loved the movie, I felt it was dramatic and touching and worth all of the acclaim and hype that it received.  Even if it had no subtitles, or words at all for that matter the movie would have had a huge impact.  The scenes and cast are simply spectacular.  What I found impressive was that the movie took a story that we've heard about for ages, read about for ages, discussed for ages and laid it out in a format that doesn't tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth's last 12 hours but instead you experience the intensity of those last 12 hours first hand.
0792165020|5.0|Sometimes you love a movie so much you almost can't put into words why.  \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is one of those films, something haunting, something that stays with the viewer long after the final credits roll. <br /> <br />Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a penniless young New Yorker who lives in squalor and works as a men's room attendant; playing piano provides his only real joy.  A gig as a substitute accompanist leads to an offer from shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn): for the princely sum of $1000, Tom heads off to Italy to try to corral the millionaire's renegade son Dickie (Jude Law) and persuade him to return home. <br /> <br />Once in Italy, however, Tom immediately falls under the spell of Dickie's ex-pat life of luxury and indolent pleasure.  Dickie has pretty much everything: looks, charm, money, nice clothes, gorgeous digs, a sailboat, pretty fiancee Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), and a gaggle of admiring friends.  With a mix of guile and well-timed lies, Tom quickly ingratiates himself into the lives of Dickie and Marge, indulging in some light-hearted hedonism.  But there's a current of darkness just beneath the sunny dolce vita, both in Tom's and Dicke's personalities.  The tension between them escalates slowly but steadily, and the viewer knows that sooner or later, the powder keg is going to explode. <br /> <br />In the two \\"Bourne\\" films, Damon plays a professional killer who's stumbling back toward the light; in \\"Ripley,\\" he plays a fairly ordinary guy (a \\"nobody,\\" he calls himself) spiraling down into darkness: the journey, like a train wreck, is awful, but still somehow mesmerizing.  Given Ripley's backstory, it's easy to empathize with him despite his immorality, and as with Jason Bourne, the viewer ends up rooting for a morally ambiguous character.  Damon is simply aces here, bringing a lot of subtlety and depth to his insanely clever but deeply insecure character.  Ripley's extreme neediness fairly leaps off the screen: even more than desiring wealth and luxury, he yearns to be loved, accepted, and well-regarded by others, but given his devious machinations, that's pretty much never going to happen. <br /> <br />Damon has to be at the top of his game, because Jude Law gives him a run for the money at every turn.  If Dickie were merely a shallow cad, the movie wouldn't work half as well as it does: the character's appeal isn't that he's wealthy and gorgeous and sexy, it's that he's funny and charming and has a way of making everyone feel special.  But he's mercurial and fickle--in one of the film's most revealing scenes, Marge cautions Tom, \\"The thing with Dickie--it's like the sun shines on you, and it's glorious.  Then he forgets you, and it's suddenly very cold.\\"  Every character wants Dickie in some way, they all crave his attention, and even when he's not around, everyone talks about him.  Like Damon, Law brings a lot of nuance to a character who isn't necessarily the nicest guy you'd ever meet, balancing a very fine line between desirable and despicable. <br /> <br />Paltrow is also terrific as the good-hearted Marge--the character lacks real complexity, but Paltrow nevertheless imbues her with a lot of warmth and sincerity.  Over the course of the film, her sunny ebullience begins to dim as she slowly realizes the extent of Ripley's evil, and Paltrow conveys Marge's confusion and anger and fear in a way that's never anything less than convincing.  Her wardrobe provides a wonderful indication of the character's mental state: as the light and joy are sucked out of Marge, she grows more groomed and coiffed and covered up, so that by her final scene, she's practically encased in armor, an apt emotional metaphor for the cold, empty shell she's become. <br /> <br />The supporting performances are likewise terrific.  Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers a knockout turn as Dickie's odious friend Freddie Miles, the only character who sees right through Ripley immediately.  Cate Blanchett issimilarly strong as Meredith Logue, a well-meaning but vapid socialite who always seems to turn up at exactly the wrong moment--like Freddie, she constantly threatens to expose Ripley's duplicity.  Blanchett's performance is remarkable given Meredith's almost complete lack of dimension.  I particularly liked Jack Davenport's charming, humorous turn as Peter Smith-Kingsley, probably the most innocent of Ripley's victims. <br /> <br />In addition to a great story and stellar performances from its cast, Ripley boasts some of the nicest possible visuals.  Italy in the 1950s provides a sumptuous backdrop for the unfolding drama, from the splendors of Venice and Rome to sun-drenched beaches and postcard-pretty fishing villages.  Director Anthony Minghella employs some breathtaking imagery--the use of mirrors and reflections throughout the film is subtle and effective, and there's a shot of the Madonna rising from the sea that's used as masterful foreshadowing.  Also top-rate is the music--not only Gabriel Yared's creepy score, but the music that the characters listen to and perform, which brings added dimension to their feelings and personalities. <br /> <br />Rarely do the elements of film-making come together as beautifully as they do in this movie: it's by turns romantic, dramatic, funny, and suspenseful; the acting is top-rate; the visuals and music all support and enhance the characters and story.  While not gratuitously violent, it's not for the faint of heart, either: \\"Ripley\\" is dark and twisted and ambiguous, its conclusion deeply unsettling.  This isn't a film for viewers who like happy endings and pat resolutions.  But if you're looking for a film with real substance and no easy answers, I recommend \\"Ripley\\" without reservation. <br />
B000006045|2.0|Aside from the stellar single Teardrop, the absolute gem of this collection, Mezzanine falls short of the dynamism that was a hallmark of their previous two albums.  I am confused as to how others see Protection as a low point of their first three albums.  My conviction is that Mezzanine is certainly the \\"weakest link.\\"
B0007TKNL0|4.0|As a die hard fan of the stage show (5 times), I eagerly awaited this movie and was not disappointed, despite a few minor quibbles: <br />(1) The \\"through the mirror\\" scene, one of the first spine-tingling moments in the show, was done terribly. <br />(2) Parts of the some of the songs were cut. <br />(3) The crashing of the chandelier was moved to the ending. <br />(4) I'm not sure I liked some of the little bits added in here and there. <br /> <br />But overall, a WONDERFUL film, undeserving of the bashing it tooks from critics. Emmy Rossum is luminous and lovely as Christine, Patrick Wilson is a perfect Raoul, and Gerard Butler sizzles as the Phantom. Minnie Driver and Natasha Richardson also excel in their supporting roles. THe sets, costumes, and cinematography are also terrific, and much like the stage version, the ending will break your heart and send chills down your spine.
B0006399FS|1.0|I love the song VERTIGO, but that's where it stops. The rest of the album DOES NOT ROCK. More esoteric crapola from the epitome of arrogant eurotrash. Those who have been on the U2 strokewagon, it's way past time to get off. One STAR for Vertigo, and a big THUMBS DOWN on U2.
B0000630BT|5.0|You should be listening to the greatest metal album I have ever owned, and I own a ton. <br /> <br />JUDAS PRIEST-PAINKILLER......IS PRETTY MUCH THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPEND TO ME. <br /> <br />BUY IT.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I have a particular interest in the development of Johnny Depp's career; the man has shown genius for so long (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), but he really went over the edge in \\"Pirates\\", and suddenly he's a force to be reckoned with. Johnny Depp is the best of our current crop of actors working today. The man has control, insight and tremendous ability to entertain, as the situation sees fit. After the crazy performance in \\"Pirates\\", Mr. Depp gives a subdued, thorougly complete rendition of J. M. Barrie's life during the creation of Peter Pan. Very fine performances from Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and a bunch of really good kid actors made this a wonderful film experience; a feel-good film that's intelligent enough for kids of all ages. A young (20's) female friend of mine thought it was dumb. As a 50+ male, I can relate, especially since I'm amused at the idea of \\"Peter Pan Syndrome\\". I hope I never grow up.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Having written a screenplay in the action/comedy genre, I fully enjoyed the masterful way Guy Ritchie created this film.  Every character had a distinct, unique profile, the story kept you on edge and entertained, and the dialogue was refreshing and unique (as well as unintelligible at times!).  Great movie, made my top 5 list.
B00003CX8N|5.0|A charming little picture about a woman booklover in NYC (Anne Bancroft) who develops a 20-year correspondence with the head of the bookshop in London at the address given in the movie's title (Anthony Hopkins). She is quirky, particular, and opinionated, but also thoughtful--she sends the shop workers food which is greatly appreciated because of the post-war shortages. The letters are the movie: Bancroft spends much of the time typing them and reading them aloud to us. Thus time and the story, meagre though it is, unfold. Bancroft and  Hopkins never meet, but they obviously have developed strong feelings for each other. Finally, after 20 years Bancroft, who is now a writer, has saved enough money to come to London, but when she arrives Hopkins has died. A very low key, literate movie; one for booklovers everywhere.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am serious about this: lost in translation is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life! This movie is going to last forever in the eternity of the worst movies ever made. If you don't believe me, please watch it. You are gonna remember me.
B0002X314C|5.0|John \\"Legend\\" Stevens has made a great first step into what will definitely be a successful career as a wonderful singer/pianist. This album is simply amazing and it's really neat to see an artist with thoughtful lyrics and that has something innovative to add to todays music, which is originality (I'm not being sarcastic either, there is a lack of originality in music today). John Legend definitely has his own style and does not sound like any of today's big R&B artists. As wonderful as this CD is, it is a bit of a dissapointment just because of the fact that it doesn't really show all of his talents as a piano player. \\"Ordinary People\\" is basically the only song that really shows his talent as a pianist while every other song is produced with more of a hip/hop beat although it is very fitting to his voice and style. Don't get the wrong idea though, the production is awesome. Kanye West did an excellent job producing for John Legend. John Legend already has great vocal talent, but his lyrics are amazing especially with how thoughtful and sometimes spiritual they are. This LP certainly earns each of the 5 stars that I gave it. <br />Here's a couple of my fave songs: <br />\\"She don't have to know\\" -Great example of his wonderful vocal talent. It's an about affair he's having with another woman. <br />\\"Number One\\" - This song has an awesome upbeat beat, great lyrics and an awesome appearance by Kanye West. <br />\\"Ordinary People\\" - Here's a song probably many of you have heard. If you've heard it then you should already have this CD. This song is the reason I bought this CD. Really shows what he has to offer.  <br />There's 14 tracks (13 not counting the Prelude) and I like all of them except for I Can Change ft. Snoop Dogg. GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!
0930289455|5.0|Written by the same genius mind that created \\"Watchmen\\" and \\"V for Vendetta,\\" and the horrific reinvention of the \\"Swamp Thing,\\" the Batman finds himself in the middle of his most hated enemy's most sadistic attack ever: the crippling of Barbara Gordon (the former Batgirl) and the kidnapping of police commissioner James Gordon. But there seems to be something more to the Joker's motives than just for sick laughs. It seems, in his own twisted way, the killer clown is trying to say something important, something about how he and the rest of world are not really all that different. This is the story of how the nameless maniac known only as \\"Joker\\" fathomed into insanity, the wrenching secrets of his troubled past are finally revealed...or at least how HE remembers it. <br /> <br />Unlike many of Alan Moore's other works, this is a \\"short story.\\" It's a simple enough, easy-to-follow story, but Moore, like he always does, builds the events with dramatic flair, which blends nicely with Brian Bolland's artwork. The best thing Moore does here is how disturbingly real he portrays the Joker. Deep inside the crooked corridors that is his mind Joker knows *something* had to drive him insane but he can't exactly remember what it was, but we see bits and pieces about as the story progresses. The character interaction and development is amazing. The complex relationship between hero and villain, and the predictable path it must follow, has never been as deeply explored as Alan Moore does it. The Joker's take on the human mind is also something to think about (\\"all it takes is one day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy--that's how far the world is from where I am\\"). This can also be interpreted as an insight into one's moral fiber, and the symbiosis between Batman and Joker. Though Joker suffered a traumatic accident that turned him into the sadistic madman he is now, Batman went through a similar \\"very bad day\\" but chose to fight for good causes, and Commissioner Gordon, even under extreme trauma at Joker's mercy himself, did not lose his sense of self; he insists Batman captures Joker \\"by the book,\\" to show him that \\"our way works,\\" and thus proving Joker's theory wrong. This what I like best about Moore's work, they always have some sort of significant points to make that make you think, or they all at least represent some kind of struggle between two forces--in this case, the relationship between comedy and madness. This short-but-sweet tale portrays the Joker at his very nastiest since he killed a bunch of boy scouts with poisoned cotton candy in Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" but it also shows him at his most human and...rational.
B00007LTIC|4.0|Suburb reissue of the long-running British progressive band's 1977 album, with six (6) fine bonus tracks added on. The title cut, \\"Going For The One\\", to me has always made Yes fans aware just how good the group has been able to put together great tunes as such. \\"Parallels\\" (one of my all time Yes faves) has rarely failed to cause my neck hairs to stand up within it's first ten notes and \\"Turn Of The Century\\" as well as the fifteen-minute \\"Awaken\\" hold up rather well on this long-player. As for the extra cuts, I was really taken with the \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Going For The One\\" rehearsals. Way to go, Rhino! A must-have. Line-up here: Jon Anderson - vocals, Steve Howe - guitar, Chris Squire - bass, Rick Wakeman - polymoog and Alan White - drums. Comes with improved / restored artwork and extended liner notes.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album revived me. It had been awhile since I heard something eccsellent. There have been good and above average records in the last couple years. This one is outstanding and really makes a statement. It mixes French lounge type stylings with great melodic, textured rock. I can't push this album enough.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I ultimately enjoyed watching this film on DVD, though I have to say that I enjoyed and was frustrated by different aspects of this film in equal measures.  On the plus side, I liked the performances, the scenery, the music, and the offbeat nature of the love story (specifically, seeing two people get so taken with each other after only a few brief meetings where only a handful of words were exchanged).  I also liked the playful sense of humor peppered throughout the movie.  On the negative side, in too many cases that sense of humor appears immediately before or after moments of horrific violence, which is jarring and disruptive.  Also, I didn't like the fact that the deputies (for want of a better word) looking for Inman because he deserted his regiment are made to be really over-the-top villainous.  This turns Inman into a kind of tragic victim when they finally catch up with him.  I think the story would have been much more memorable if the deputies were simply regular, honorable people with an unpleasant task: rounding up and punishing deserters.  That would have resulted in Inman being responsible for the consequences of his actions (deserting his regiment to find the love of his life), which is much more interesting and tragic than having cartoon villains finally catch up with him, the \\"good\\" guy.  To end on a positive note, \\"Cold Mountain\\" is over two-and-a half hours long, and it held my interest throughout.  Nice image quality and a second disc of extras round out a generous and nicely-produced package.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Slayer really came through to me on my headphomes. They talked to me through their music and made me stronger. Granted, the music is about the devil and I don't like him much, but all the same, I was able to pedal my bike a lot faster on my paper route because he was in my head. This band wins.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is an awesome CD, Highly recommended, all the songs are AWESOME!!!! GO BRITNEY!
6304509170|5.0|This movie was great. The special effects were really good. You have to pay close attention in order to follow what is going on. Michael Ironside plays a great pyscho.
B0000931OG|5.0|Since I like all allbums of Blur very much, I can not say that this is their 'best'. Every album has a specific sound and feeling to it, and there's one for every mood. Having said this, Think Tank is probably Blur's most beautiful album. Those melodies!! Of course there are a few 'mistakes' on the album (\\"We've got a file on you\\" for example), but in general this album is one of the most sophisticated and musical albums I have ever heard.
630471193X|4.0|Confusion. Nauseating. Touching. Homey. Four words I'd use to describe the movie known as \\"Phenomenon\\", one that I watched yesturday during my psychology class. Why the confusion, why the nausea? Perhaps because I wasn't expecting this movie...I didn't even know what it was called. But aside from that, and aside from looking at a scientific explanation, this movie exceeds on most standards. What fooled me at the beginning surprised me near the end; towards the beginning I was feeling almost stupid watching this because there was no scientific explanation for what was happening. A man sees a bright light and the next day wakes up a genius. He seems oblivious to wanting to know why this happens to him but instead choses to go with the flow and, after sensing the beginnings of an earth quake, seems at a loss and seeks for answers to his newly developed questions when all begins to go downhill. <br /> <br />I won't go into too much detail about what happens next but for the most part of the movie, I was in a state of confusion. Why was Travolta feeling like this? What happened to him? And most importantly, why doesn't he seem concerned when everybody else in his know-all town is? I think that, coupled with the small-town feeling (which makes me feel nauseas at times) and the irritating music made me feel out of the loop while everybody else around me was oohing and awing over Travolta's performence. <br /> <br />Towards the end, I was feeling a little bit more reassured. There are some touching scenes but Travolta's great performence more than makes up for the confusion surrounding his diagnosis. His love interest (who's name I cannot recall at the moment) does an outstanding performence as a torn bystander who doesn't know what else to do but simply watch her friend break apart day by day. Altough Travolta's diagnosis is truly devastating, it's wonderful to watch how he deals with it...and I think that's where this movie excels, the point it's trying to make and the point I missed entirely (perhaps because I was expecting more of a scientifically visioned film). This movie isn't about psychology or about earning 200 IQ points over night - it's about being the outcast, being the scum of society, being the freak of nature...and learning how to deal with it.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00030590I|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I rented Hero, but I was pleasantly surprised. With its intense visual style, gracefully choreographed fight scenes and a storyline that you are really able to get into, Hero proves to be the only movie I've seen recently that is really worth a damn. I've heard people say it's the Chinese 'Braveheart' and I really think that sums this picture up. This definitely feels like epic filmmaking. I would absolutely recommend this one to not only people that are fans of martial arts movies, but also to people who are enraptured by awesome storytelling. Plus the visual style in this film is just phenomenal.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|two couples, caught in a web of passion and betrayal, struggle to find lasting love in a modern world.  DVD includes \\"the blower's daughter\\" music video by damien rice and minimal special features.  a great look at \\"the other side\\" and proves that even though some might appear to be, nobody is perfect.  clive owen definitely steals the show with his powerful performance and jude law's character was also strong, but this movie is miles away from happy.
B00008OLYN|5.0|A friend of mine recommended I check this CD out, saying it was one of the best he had heard in a while.  Being familiar with Opeth's previous works, I was expecting a torrential downpour of progressive death metal.  What I encountered was an album that made me angry; angry that music like this isn't getting radio play, while no-talent idiots rule the mainstream rock arena supreme.    With the music turned down a notch and the vocals being a bit more understandable, Opeth managed to capture their sound without deviating from writing good music.  In an era where most metal bands write a soft album to \\"get big\\" and forget about whatever originality they previously had, Opeth wrote a softer album in homage to their progressive influences and came out with an astonishing album that not only highlights their exceptional song writing ability, but also fills even the most novice music listener with a euphoria commonly associated with a religious experience.    Despite being eight songs deep, each song carries itself rather well.  Windowpane, In My Time of Need, and Death Whispered a Lullaby bring through a wave of deep, ambient energy, which suits to build up Closure, which may be the heaviest sounding track on the CD.  It almost feels as if these songs build the introduction to the theme of the album, whereas the final four songs seem to establish the resolution of the album, especially the instrumental near the end, appropriately titled Ending Credits.    There is one track which I personally feel goes above and beyond the level that would be considered exceptional.  The song Hope Leaves is absolutely beautiful and hypnotic, unveiling singer/guitarist Mikael Akerfeldt's ability to demonstrate a part of their music that can relate to the core of the human experience.  While a poetic love song about losing that \\"special someone\\" might sound contrived when many others write a song on that topic, few can truly capture the feeling the way that Opeth does during this song.I feel sorry for the Opeth fans who've turned their back on this album, claiming that it should be as \\"metal\\" as their previous efforts.  They're truly neglecting a work of excellence due to the fact that it doesn't fit into the conventional context of what is expected of a \\"metal\\" band.  Lesser bands have achieved platinum status.    Please stop at nothing to get this CD.  You owe it to yourself to make this a part of your collection.  Hopefully, radio will open its eyes to this type of work, and a new standard will be set for exceptional song writing once again.
B000002P72|5.0|By and large live albums are mostly a disappointment, but occasionally there are those rare moments when an artist connects with the audience and something truly magical occurs. There are only a handful of truly essential live albums, like the Allman Brothers' AT FILLMORE EAST, the Rolling Stones' GET YER YA YA'S OUT and the Who's LIVE AT LEEDS. You can also add to the list B.B. King's LIVE AT THE REGAL.<br /><br />On Nov. 21, 1964, B.B. King stepped onto the stage of the Regal Theatre in Chicago and produced one of the best blues albums of all time. What makes this all the more amazing is that by 1964, B.B. King had been doing about 300 shows a year for the previous ten years and he still had the energy of a man half his age.  Judging from the two separate introduction (before track 1 and again before track 6), the songs were taken from two different sets.  Of the ten songs, he went back to the early years of his career with 1953's \\"You Upset Me Baby\\" and 1955's \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\" and continued through to the present with his then current hit \\"How Blue Can You Get.\\"<br /><br />B.B. King is backed by a six-piece band, including Kenneth Sands (trumpet), Johnny Board and Bobby Forte (tenor sax), Duke Jethro (piano), Leo Lauchie (bass), and Sonny Freeman (drums).  As stated in the original liner notes: \\"These are the blues, and this is the King--B.B.!\\" 'Nuf said. ESSENTIAL
B000007T2Z|5.0|Fisrt of all, this cd is amazing, it is probably some of the best music of our time.  I here some of you saying that you wasted your money on F#A# (oo)because the cd is only brought up of three tracks, your right to a certain extent, but if you listen to the music and listen to the whole track on all three tracks, you can clearly HEAR that Tracks one, two and three are also consisted of movements.  Yeah one track is between 16 to 29 minutes long, but its not just one song its many different Movements to make one song.  Sort of like when you see a ballet or an opera which usually consist of 2 or 3 Acts, but the acts consist of how many movements.  Act one alone might have 6 movements in it where as Act two might have 8 movements.  It is the same. If only some people would open up the front cover, the movements to tracks one, two and three are there.  Here are my ratings on the songs:    1) The Deadflag Blues (16:27) - 100/50 AMAZING     First Movement) The Deadflag Blues (Intro) (0:00 - 6:37)     Second Movement) Slow Moving Trains (6:37 - 10:10)     Third Movement) The Cowboy (10:10 - 14:27)     Fourth Movement) Outro - (14:27 - 16:27)    2) East Hastings (17:58) - 100/50 AMAZING     First Movement) Nothing's Alrite In Our Life/Deadflag Blues                      Reprise - (0:00 - 1:35)     Second Movement) The Sad Mofioso - (1:35 - 12:19)     Third Movement) Drugs In Tokyo/Black Helicopter -                      (12:19 - 17:58)    3) Providence (21:15) 100/50 AMAZING     First Movement) Divorce And Forever - (0:00 - 2:44)     Second Movement) Dead Methany - (2:44 - 10:51)     Third Movement) Kicking Horse On Brokenhill - (10:51 - 16:44)     Fourth Movement) String Loop Manufactured During Downpour -                      (16:44 - 21:15)      J.L.H Outro - (24:54 - 29:02) 100/50    Also They don't state in any of there songs about hating the American people, this is just ignorance.  It clearly states In Baise Bailey Finnegan 3 (If you heard anything different from them) They State they love the American People They just don't agree with our government and as a matter of fact, I don't agree with our governement either. I mean, I am not an Anarchist or anything. But, if you say thats why you don't like Godspeed, then you should state why you dont like the Anarchists in our own country, as well.  I mean you guys should worry more about the People in our own country like ANARCHISTS not a band from Canada. And they don't state anything about 9/11 in any of their music.  A lot of people think that F#A# (infinity symbol) has to do with 9/11 but it doesn't at all and in plus the cd was released in 97/98 4 or 5 years before 9/11 ever happened. If any of there cd had to do with 9/11 then we wouldn't call IMPROF we would call it wirtten music and it isnt that why we can't catergorize them in any genre.  The cd F#A# (infinity symbol) has to do with the end of the world and how everyone (not just americans) including them are at fault.  And if you think about it we are.  All of the Hairspray, Perfume, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, is tearing a whole in our ozone layer, look at all the factories just about every country has.  That is what they are talking about in this cd not 9/11, I want to know how that rumor evolved.  It is perfectly clear that music is bassed upon movements it is not just a 3 songs it is 12 and if you guys open the cover you would clearly see that.
B0006399FS|1.0|Let me start by saying I love U2, have been on the bandwagon since \\"War\\" and own every CD they have released. U2 have now completed a decade of sub-par releases! <br />When I heard that they were getting back to their roots on \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" I was overjoyed, being disappointed with everything since \\"Actung Baby\\". After listening to this CD, I have to wonder where this hype was coming from. It is NOTHING like the earlier albums. Except for \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" this is a CD of lullaby's, and Larry wanted to leave the band after \\"Rattle And Hum\\"? Put it this way, If their career started with \\"Pop\\" they would be DONE. Where as \\"War\\" played in a car will get you where your going faster, this CD will put you to sleep and off the road! It's as if the band has run out of ideas, and has nothing new to say. Hang it up, boys. Rock &Roll is for the young, and your age is showing. Thanks though for the first fifteen years, it was a great ride.
B0002OERI0|4.0|First off, let me say that I am a firm believer in freedom of speech.  I may not always agree with what is being said, but I will respect ones opinion and give them props for actually standing for something. <br /> <br />That aside, I don't agree with the politics expressed in this album.  In fact, that would be the main reason why I set this album aside for as long as I did.  When I first heard the song \\"American Idiot\\", I was severly turned off to the whole album.  I have always been a Green Day fan (their first few albums at least), and have always given them a chance.  But I just couldn't find it in me to give this album a chance!  Too bad for me... <br /> <br />After a recent suggestion from a co-worker, I found myself changing my mind, and decided to give the album a try.  I listened to the title track with an open mind, but still couldn't like it.  I think it's more of a musical dislike than political.  Expecting more of the same, I proceded to the next track.  Wow.. a good song!  Next track.. another good song.  I listened to the whole album with a similar feeling.  I was very impressed with the music quality, and lyricism (even though I don't agree with the political standpoint of the album, as previously mentioned.) <br /> <br />Long story short, I was genuinely impressed by this album!  After a slump over the past few years, it looks like Green Day is back and as strong as ever.  I still prefer their older sound, but this album was still a welcome relief worth listening to. <br /> <br />4/5.  Great Album.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|I just recently purchased \\"Human After All\\" off Itunes, the newest album from the techno wonder boys from France. Having both \\"Homework\\" and \\"Discovery\\", I wasn't expecting this one to be similar to either of those two. Truth be told, \\"Discovery\\" sounded different from \\"Homework\\", so another change in style I was expecting. That's exactly what I got with \\"Human After All.\\" Yes, this CD is a lot of fun to listen to like the previous two, but alas, it isn't perfect and does have a few shortcomings. <br /> <br />First, to the good stuff. This CD is not as happy sounding or as cheesy as \\"Discovery\\". That means this isn't going to sound as peppy as the previous album. Is that a bad thing? Well, depends. It did give \\"Discovery\\" it's overall theme of good times for the new millenium (who at that time wasn't coming out with a party album for the beginning of the 2000's? Hell, Prince did his back in 1983!) \\"Human After All\\" takes a harder rocking, darker approach. This means the peppyness and cheesy sound of \\"Discovery\\" is gone, in it's place are songs with more guitars and upping the drums. For some like me, this makes for a more rhythmatic sound and also gives more of an edge. However, it leaves for less experimentation and diversity. That is where this album starts sounding like \\"Homework\\". Many of the songs on this album sound alike and get repetitious, like they did on \\"Homework\\". Also, the electronic noises and sounds are harder sounding and more present than in \\"Discovery\\", which sometimes can lead to headaches or just getting annoying. Those are the things that separate this disc for the better and the worse from previous outings. <br /> <br />Now what songs are good? There are a few in the bunch. The titles track will get you moving, and it will also send a chill down your spine. It really doesn't sound like anything they have ever released, so in that way it is killer. It's probably my favorite track on the album. \\"Robot Rock\\" is the most (ironically) rock soundingsong on the album. For that reason, I really like it, and it's the hardest rocking and has the most edge that Daft Punk has had. \\"Make Love\\" takes the typical Daft Punk \\"ballad\\" like \\"Digital Love\\" from \\"Discovery\\" and makes it more direct, less dreamy and varied, and just as relaxing and even more smooth. Beautiful keyboards and piano on that number, though it does start to get repetitive and long. \\"Technologic\\" shows that the boys still can makes plain ol' silly songs that still can get you moving, just like they have before. <br /> <br />If you love Daft Punk, you will need to pick this album up and add it to your collection. If you don't like them, this probably isn't going to change your mind or perception. It's an acquired taste, and those that don't have it, this album will just trigger the gag reflex. For those who love techno or Daft, pick it up today and feel the rhythm take over.
140004281X|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read by Munro, and it far exceeded my expectations. That said, this wonderful collection is also more than capable of breaking your heart.The title story was my least favorite of the collection,instead loving the surprising and superior \\"Tricks\\", which left me with a lingering ache. All of the stories run on a somewhat familiar terrain of love, longing, regret,and betrayal, three of the eight centering on the same woman at different stages of her life. The stories are painful in their honest representations of the heart. Yet that's what also makes it such terrific writing
6304806434|1.0|Con air is an unrelenting bludgeoning of the viewer's ability to suspend disbelief, more so than any other movie with the exception of that other Bruckheimer atrocity, Armageddon.  If American moviegoers had any sense of honor in this day and age, the writer of this offal would have his back permanently stained yellow with the nation's collective pee rather than rewarding this magnum opus of balderdash with their wallets.  <br /> <br /> Rather than delve into the myriad throughly unrealistic events that occur in the film that other reviewers have mentioned - I'll just concentrate on the finale.  The plane full of cons is out of gas and running on one engine just outside Las Vegas - looking for a place to land, Nicolas Cage's character, Poh, and the con pilot claim that they can't make the airstrip and must land the plane on 'the strip'.  Last time I flew into Vegas, I recalled the airport to be no more than 1/4 mile directly adjacent to 'the strip' - PLEEEEZE.     <br /> <br />The only enjoyable aspect of the film was the writer's choice to challenge Cage's acting chops by crippling him with a Southern accent.
B00008RH3L|3.0|Twisty script is ok, clever dialogs are ok, acting is ok.. What about the cinematography you get loads of in latter coen movies such as Barton Fink, O Brother, Fargo, Big Lebowski..? Miller's Crossing belongs to a theater play rather than cinema..
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|The sound of the new QOTSA album this time around is a more lush one. Swirling melodies and catchy guitar licks are abound on this one. This isnt a \\"rock opera\\" or \\"concept album\\"...even the now diluted Green Day couldn't make an album this good. The music is effective for what it is, which is a groove laiden rock and roll album. Lullabies is the perfect word too; They take almost childish-like melodies and rock them out. Mind you this isnt Song For The Deaf, which was meant to be a hard rock album. Josh Homme and Co. change their musical style every album, but always retain the rock n roll element. So if you are a fan this should come as no surprise to you. As laid back as this album is, it is quite heavy in sound.  Overall even minus a one Nick Oliveri, I dig it. I dig it a lot. The vocal treatments were well done. This is a sarcastic album so be prepared for some random sillyness! A bonus: The instrumentals and acoustics are awesome!Get it most definitley if you liked the first album. Same nostalgic vibe.<br /><br />Worth repeated listenings;Its like Alice in Wonderland meets Queens of the Stone Age...
B000683VI4|2.0|Cloyingly sweet tear-jerker that overflows with sentimentality that left this reviewer feeling emotionally manipulated. The first 20 minutes or so are soporifically boring as the two main characters meet and slowly fall in love. After that, the plot moves forward at a more rigorous pace. However, the plot revolves around the standard \\"rich girl-poor boy\\" device that has been done many times before, including their separation and reunion many years later. Then comes the dilemma of the woman having to choose between her current fiance and her previous lover. Snore.       What is somewhat redeeming are the terrific performances by James Garner and Gena Rowlands who play the lovers in their old age. The ending is contrived, but will wrench tears from you nonetheless. Recommended for those seeking a romantic cry-fest.
0671015206|3.0|This book is common sense. I bet the author is a multi-millionaire after he sold this book. I will summarize and save you the price of this book. <br /> <br />1)If you spend more money than you make you will not be rich. So, if you want to be rich, save more money than you spend. Common sense. <br /> <br />2)Most people who own expensive cars and houses are not rich. In todays world anyone can get a credit card or loan and afford almost anything they want. Common sense. <br /> <br />3)Invest or buy stuff that will make you money. Do not spend money on name brand clothing if you only plan to wear it a month than throw it away. Common sense. <br /> <br />4)Own a business. Why go to college and invest time learning stuff only to work for a company for little money? The company is getting rich off of your hard work. I know a person who owns a business she never went to college or has any indepth knowledge of what her company produces. Yet, she makes more money than the high skilled employees. Common sense.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|First off, this is Queens of the Stone Age's FOURTH album, not third. People must be forgetting the ass kicking, booty shaking self-titled debut. But on to the review. The easiest way to sum this album up is Desert Sessions 9 1/2. A very good album and I personally believe very influenced by Josh's sessions (In My Head was actually taken from Vol. 9 & 10). The album doesn't rock as hard as Songs did, but, what rocking out it doesnt have, it makes up in with smooth, catchy, eerie, riffs and vocals that will make you want to listen to the album over and over again. You can definitly see the difference in drummers (Dave Grohl was loud and random while Joey is softer and more punctual). Definitly not Songs for the Deaf but definitly an album worth checking out. Constant reinvention, you have to love it.

B000063JZQ|1.0|This has to be the most boring MacBeth I have ever seen!!!! I love Shakespeare and different interpretations, but this one was unbelievable.  The only things remotely interesting were the naked witches and that was interesting only because it was weird.  Really, why would witches run around naked in a very damp and cold looking Scotland? I actually fast-forwarded through the movie I was so bored.  The actors had the charisma (for the most part) of dead fish.  The only one who seemed flesh and blood was Banquo.  Even Lady MacBeth was rather dull, though the fact that she looked the epitome of a California girl was interesting.  Basically, rent it once.  Do not buy it!!!!!

B00008V5VN|3.0|I really loved Sleep's Holy Mountain, and couldn't wait to get a hold of Dopesmoker. I kept on hearing that it was like Holy Mountain times 90, and much slower and heavier. Well, after a lot of listenings, it has it's ups and downs.<br /><br />1)The riffs are awesome, that is true. The beginning riff is so simple, yet so heavy, you have to stand in awe. Also, the riff after the slow sitar-thing is great.<br /><br />2)The vocals are irritating. They sound like a barbarian doing opera. It's ridiculous.<br /><br />3)The song starts to lose steam in the middle, and has too much singing. Also, the riffs aren't as good as the earlier ones.<br /><br />4)Things pick up and never lose steam after the 2nd guitar solo.<br /><br />5)It's not as slow and heavy as people say it is. Electric Wizard was slower. AND heavier.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good song, but I prefer Holy Mountain. Also, there is a cool bonus track called Sonic Titan that rules. If you enjoy Electric Wizard and Holy Mountain, this is for you.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is a wonderful film, and the best judges of it are my kids.  They have watched this - and forced me to watch it with them - at least 10 times in the last few weeks.  I really like the characters in it and find all sorts of subtleties, many of them precedents to the later masterful trilogy.<br /><br />I don't know why people are so critical of this, unless they wanted more of the same from the first trilogy.  That would be boring if you ask me:  this is a different world complete with a crumbling political order and the latent seeds of destruction and chaos, leading directly into the themes that are so rich in the original Lucas production.  Indeed, these themes are deepened here with new details that are left for interpretation.<br /><br />Moreover, the story is extremely dense with details that can live in the imagination.  For example, while we know Aniken becomes Darth Vader, his relationship with Qui-Gon is such that if he, rather than Obi-Wan became his mentor/master, his future might have been very different.  That is fate, but also incredible richness in character and theme.  You can get into all of that if you are so inclined, which as a scifi lover I am.<br /><br />It is a matter of taste, of course.  I think this is truly brilliant sci-fi, with wonderful values that beg for thoughtful interpretation.  It teaches kids a lot, too, about loyalty, ambition, and even politics.  I simply love it all.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B0007O38F8|4.0|50 Cent's second solo CD dropped recently and I picked it up the first week. Now I'm a big fan of 50 Cent, and pretty much the entire Shady/Aftermath label. When I first heard this CD, I gotta say I didn't like it alot. Though after a few times, this CD really grew on me. The beats are sick, the lyrics are tight, everything. The song ''Piggy Bank,'' which everyone has probably heard about by now, completely disses the entire New York rap scene, pretty sick stuff. It's a good song, but to me, the best song on the album is ''My Toy Soldier'' featuring Tony Yayo. I love the beat, sound effects, and the flow. Awesome song. This CD is a very good CD, maybe even better then the first, you need to go get this.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead's CD is one of the best out there! With all of the pop bubblegum glittery crap, she is a breath of fresh air. She may only be 15  (almost 16) but she has a voice WAY beyond her years! You will be missing out on some amazing music if you pass up this cd!
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|For you Queens fans, I'm glad that they didn't make a \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" Part II.  While \\"SFTD\\" was more of hard rock record, \\"Lullabies\\" incorporates a lot more different influences.  \\"Burn The Witch (Swamp Boogie), \\"Someone's In The Wolf (Led Zeppelin), \\"Broken Box\\" (Love & Rockets !!) and the string of three hard rockers (Medication, Insane, & Tangled Up In Plaid).  As usual, Josh's pyschedelic and Cream influences are splattered throughout the record. <br /> <br />Complaints: \\"In My Head\\" and \\"I Never Came\\" are filler.  \\"Medication\\" almost sounds like a \\"Feel Good Song Of The Summer\\" rewrite.  Joey Castillo is still their worst drummer and his drums really have been mixed down in this record.   <br /> <br />It's great record to listen to at 1 in the morning.  Be patient with the record as a whole and make sure you sit down and give the proper time to give it a good listen alone.  Without a doubt, buy this record !!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan since Dookie so it's great to see these guys still producing such high quality music.  It's all here; slashing guitars, bitingly sarcastic lyrics and pop hooks that grab your cranium with all their might and won't let go. Green Day proved long ago they were an excellent punk band. How many other bands could have stood in for the mighty Ramones when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame?  On \\"American Idiot\\" Green Day show us they are also a great pop band.  Billie Joe Armstrong is one hell of a songwriter and he proves it over and over again on this CD.  I haven't been able to find a bad song in the bunch, even after many repeated listenings.  \\"American Idiot\\" is a swift kick in the balls to the right wing junta that have taken over our government and are trying to force-feed us their neo-fascist agenda. It is even more unkind to the co-opted media and the hypnotized masses who are even now mindlessly drinking the kool-aid. It's a great song and absolutely burns the house down.  \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" is a masterful long form piece that takes on American suburban alienation with a nod and a wink. (It's no easy feat to keep a pop song going for over 9 minutes and still keep it fresh!)  Equally good and similar in subject matter is the punk anthem \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\".   \\"She's A Rebel\\" and \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" have soaring hooks that take you straight to pop heaven.  The boys aren't afraid to bring it down a notch and show us they can be tender on the wistful ballad \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".  Best of all \\"American Idiot\\" hangs together as a cohesive whole.  All 13 tracks add up to one big piece of music that is greater than the sum of its parts. Repeated musical and lyrical themes appear across various tracks adding to the sense that this is actually the first punk rock opera. It represents a giant step forward for Green Day, a band that continues to fight the good fight against the endless deluge of mediocremusic flooding our radio waves and cable transmissions. Keep up the good work guys. Don't give up!
0142002038|5.0|Like all of Ian Fleming's novels, this book is vastly superior to the movie of the same name.  James Bond is much more realistic as his closest escapes come from his cunning not a crazy gadget.  He is more lifelike and easier to relate to than the megastud actuion hero of the movies.  The plot is tautly woven, and the mystery begins on the first pages with the murder of Strangways.  Fleming shoves a lot of information the reader's way, and it is up to you to decide what you believe at the final encounter.  Doctor No is also great because it was written in 1958.  Its Jamaica is one still part of Britain and untouched by tourism.  Nearby Cuba is a friendly nation, and all James needs is a trusty gun and a beautiful girl.  There were problems then, but they were much simpler than those of today, and it is refreshing to read about them
B000063DIH|3.0|`Fear of the Dark' is a good album, but it is also one of Iron Maiden's weakest efforts. There are some classic songs and a lot of filler. There is more filler on this album than any other Iron Maiden record. The title track is what saves this album from being a total failure for the band. It is one of Iron Maiden's best songs, and a crowd favorite.  <br /> <br />The record starts out with a bang. `Be Quick or Be Dead' is one of the best tracks on the record. Bruce Dickinson uses a different, rougher vocal style on this song and it fits perfectly. `From Here to Eternity' is a good song that is more commercial. `Afraid to Shoot Strangers' is a classic Iron Maiden song with a blistering solo. As you can see the album starts out promising but it goes downhill fast. Tracks 4 through 11 are filler with a few good solos and vocal melodies. As I said before, the title track is perfect and ends the record on a good note. <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD to any hardcore Iron Maiden fan because it does have its moments. But if you're just a casual listener then I would not recommend it.  <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|These musicians are phenominal!  The overlapping texture of sound on this album is amazing.  The vocals are amazing, and the guitarist bassist and drummer are some of the best I have ever heard.  How come these guys are not more popular??  I can see how this might be an acquired taste to some, but I liked this album right from the get-go.   <br /> <br />the album starts off with a haunting and seductive intro that blasts you into the second track at assault speed. If you can imagine a high-pitched (but beautifull) voice scream-singing \\"NOW IM LOST!\\"  in such a way that it will make your spine shiver while the band plays at full punk throttle.  The starts and stops of the album with odd sequences of sounds in the middle add to the melee.  Somehow they take all of their outside influences, which include everything from latin fusion to King Crimson, and make it all fit.  I can only imagine how many drumsticks and guitar strings were sacrificed in the process.  I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for something fresh, energizing, and new.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|Yeah I did'nt like these movies until about 2000. I did not get it I thought he was serious then I saw it and I understood. There were 3 movies about Austin Powers and his battles against Dr. Evil. I thought the best one has to be the third where they meet Mr. Roboto and they find out Austin and Dr. Evil are brothers. We find out that Dr. Evil was the #1 in his spy class. <br />The Second Movie had the Intro of Mini Me and Fat B******. <br />The First one is the Introduction to the series.
B00014NE62|5.0|I saw this in college in 1987 when it was first released in the theaters - yes, a bunch of us took a sort of \\"field trip\\" to dare stand in line to see the (at the time) controversial MAURICE - remember, this was when the very act of going to the cinema and buying a ticket for a certain kind of film was an act of courage, defiance, and even self-definition.  Alas, they just don't make movies like this anymore.  Simply put, if you've read the original book, you know that the acting, casting, cinematography, music, writing, and directing all come together to form a perfect piece of art that has the power to change lives.  Almost two decades later (and I feel so old now!), MAURICE takes on an even greater resonance, clarity, and emotional power - try not to watch the film's final few minutes (where Maurice and Scudder's love OPENS a new door, while Clive SHUTS another to his own life) and not be moved.  Whatever happened to James Wilby, who played the title role? We all know what Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, and others went on to, but what of the superlative Wilby?  Thank goodness the valuable DVD extras fill us in with fascinating interviews and inside insight into the creation of this masterpiece - also included are a half-hour of deleted scenes, many of them making the \\"love that dare not speak its name\\" much more explicit than the final cut, which shed some skin, as well as whole minor characters to boot.  In any version, MAURCE is a must-have - and hats off to Criterion on another world-class DVD to set the standard.  Like THE COLOR PURPLE, this is a beautifully made contemporary CLASSIC that you can watch over & over without ever getting bored, each timing discovering new elements.  If you love this also check out other Merchant & Ivory winners like REMAINS OF THE DAY, et al.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|I loved the first film, Bridget Jones' Diary.  It was witty, funny, clever, realistic, and touching. The sequal, however, was the opposite.  <br /> <br />The film begins nearly right where the first left off, which was a plus, for so many of us were curious to see where the romance of the heroine, Bridget, and her new beax, Mark Darcy, would lead. It quickly loses steam and SENSE from then on. Why?  Gone are the \\"insightful\\" reflections of Bridget that lead us to care about her in the film.  In its place are a few ill-matched diary-esque insights amidst a series of odd (a Thai prison, are you kidding me?) situations or the stereotypical social scene (Mark's lawyer's ball).  In an effort to make us laugh, Bridget is thrown out of plane, a ski lift, and is subjected to drugs, water puddles, and hair and make-up mishaps.  Also missing was the clever infiltration of Bridget's parents (they have a very minor role this time) who really livened up the first film.  What could have been a satisfying final chapter wound up being a big dissapointment.
0930289455|5.0|... yes, it's dark, twisted & a little sick but it's wonderfully written & brilliantly illustrated. Those reviwers who have said things like 'the Joker wouldn't do that' are missing the point entirely. Just 'cos it hasn't happened before doesn't make it wrong. This is Moore's take on the story, his version of the events that led to the Joker's persona shed an interesting light on the tale, he could easily be a sexually depraved pervert. He didn't buy the carnival - D'uh! HE KILLED THE GUY! And shoot Moore for suggesting that Batman wouldn't laugh at a Joker joke! What are you personal friends of Bruce Wayne? It shows that he too can be pushed over the edge. C'mon people... every Batman story is a new author's take on the legend. Moore is clever enough to break out of the mould that says every Batman tale must show the Waynes being murdered... it's a Joker story & a well told one at that!<br /><br />Buy this book... it's not for kids (or it seems Batman nerds!) but it's cool!
B000003TAW|5.0|In today's world of post-punk mortem, its always comforting to find a band that can still write a somewhat poppy rock song with lyrics you can actually understand. This is found in the freshman effort of Weezer on their magnifican Blue album. Their cover art tells a lot about them- simple band that just wants to make great music. Their power chords manage to be somewhat overpowering on the opening \\"My Name is Jonas\\" while still letting lead singer Rivers Cuomo spin his web of brillance with the simplistic verses that still reek of metaphoric meaning.Of course, I have no idea what he is talking about, but thats beside the point. The album then goes into \\"No One Else\\" and \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\\", which Rivers has described as \\"an idiot being overly jealous of the boys who talk to his girlfried, and the same idiot wondering where she has gone.\\"  <br /> <br />  Following that, the CD turns into 2 massive radio hits, \\"Buddy Holly\\" and \\"The Sweater Song\\". 20 years from now, when you mention Buddy Holly, every 30 something will immediately say \\"Oh yea, that song with the Happy Days video!' But this song is so much more than that. It has great guitar riffs, a simplistic drum  beat that works perfectly, and of course the \\"Wo-woos\\" that punctuate the chorus. Sometimes, I get caught up in the sillyness of the Sweater Song, and start headbanging to the slow decay from a really calm and organized first verse and chorus into a minute long guitar solo at the end.  <br />  Things kind of mellow out for a few songs, with Surf Wax America being a fantastic live song (especially at the end after he screams \\"Lets Go!\\") and with Say it Ain't so showing a little darker side of Weezer that shows up in full force on Pinkerton. Then comes the albums gift to nerds with In The Garage. This song mentions Dungeons and Dragons, X-Men and Ace Freely-I mean, how trivial can you get? Still, this is the best use of the power chords on the whole CD, and is a fantastic song. Holiday has a pretty good bassline, but is probably the only weak link on the album. But it'll sure as heck get stuck in your head! Then we come to the ending Only in Dreams (I bet your dreaming that I would wrap this review up already). This song is pretty much him reading some poetry over music, and then he rants for a few minutes, and the last half of the song is like guitarapalooza, if you know what I mean. Overall, if you are planning to learn more about a fantastic band, buy this album, then buy Pinkerton, then buy Maladroit. Hopefully, Make Believe, their 5th album will be as rocking as these are, and I expect to find out on May 10th, and I think that you should too.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|I know her voice isn't the greatest but the mixing & production of these tunes is nothing short of outstanding.  I also know there are detractors who say she just relies on her body to make money.  Yet, they fail to mention that she did in just 6 years what no female solo artist since Madonna's heyday in the 1980s has done; that is go from a new artist with a great debut album to cultural superstar. <br />Her 3 new tunes are all great, My Prerogative is a great opener, I've Just Begun is a nice addition that holds its own against some of the legendary female artists around, & Do Somethin' is a great closer with a beat that is solid. <br />The real strength here is the material amassed in such a span <br />of time.  Baby One More Time, Oops! I Did It Again, Stronger, Lucky & Everytime are all very solid tunes that're what carries the album & shows off her musical skills.  The tracks aren't in chronological order, but that's okay because there's so many good tunes here that it doesn't matter that much to me.  The musical quality of these tunes is nothing short of great on each one & the production & mixing are really solid & keep the album sounding so good. <br />I'd like to have seen Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know & From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart make the cut as well, but this is still a very solid & tight greatest hits package that I've not seen a female solo artist pull off since Maddona's wonderful The Immaculate Collection was done.  I don't know about the quality of the 6 bonus tracks as I've only got the standard 17-track disc.
B0007O38F8|3.0|The two best tracks on the record are also the last two tracks on the record, \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" and \\"Love It Or Hate It (Remix)\\". The former jacks its beat from Ghostface's \\"Metal Lungies\\" and the second is a remix of a track from The Game's The Documentary. This would be a really bad thing for an album that clocks in at just under 78mins if these two tracks weren't so tight. Also, these two tracks do not carry the album as there are hits galore littered across the album. \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\" are hits. \\"Ski Mask Way\\" are \\"Gunz Come Out\\" are underground classics and essential parts to any mixtape worth spending your hard earned $5 on. \\"Piggy Bank\\" is the necessary diss track that has everyone holding their breathe waiting for what's going to happen next. \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\", \\"Outta Control\\", \\"Position Of Power\\" are all waiting in the wings to explode onto the charts.<br /><br />The problem with the album is that  its too long, too many tracks & too much 50 cent. If I could use one word to describe The Massacre it would be overkill. The tracks are overproduced, the lyrics are repetitive and the delivery gets tired after 21 tracks. Even when 50 does get clever with his wordplay like on \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" its too little too late. I usually hate interludes but this album could have used more breaks from 50's monotonous flow. I usually hate albums with too many guests but they could have been useful here. Track for track this is not a bad album at all but it needs to be taken in doses to be appreciated. I can compare this album to Encore which was also loaded with great tracks (\\"Encore\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Mosh\\", \\"Rain Man\\") but was not a great album compared to the previous Slim Shady releases. The Massacre is unlike The Documentary, Welcome to Cashville and The Hunger For More which played like albums whether you liked them or not.<br /><br />I'm sure that over time this album will grow on me like the first one did but the first impression is that 50 could have done much better.ion is that 50 could have done much better.
B000002B2T|5.0|Alice In Chains.....Pearl Jam.....Screaming Trees, get yourself chris cornell and you've got yourself an unrivaled supergroup. but that's really just being greedy.  <br />this album is a 10 song collection of some of the most haunting and beautifully crafted grunge songs ever. a one off album like 'temple of the dog', 'above' deserves to be a hell of a lot more acclaimed than it is. but that's part of the attraction. spinning this disc and knowin the masses are missing out, perversly makes it that more enjoyable. 'long gone day' 'river of deceit' and 'artificial red' are the stand out tracks on an album smouldering with some of the finest recorded songs ever. no exageration, it really is that damned good
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I loved this show. Just saw that it is going onsale on ticketmaster tomorrow for Rochester. I will be at the show on July 28th! Can't wait.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie, based on the book by J. Gallagher entitled \\"Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican\\" describes in somewhat romantic detail the true story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, represented in this wonderful film by Gregory Peck. This is a World War II era based film, well written, concerning the Priest who is in reality a close associate of Pope Pius XII and the Holy Office of the Inquisition. The Monsignor and his Italian associates hide escaping POW's who sought sanctuary at the Vatican once they had escaped unguarded Italian POW camps at the time of the Italian surrender and German occupation of Rome. O'Flaherty took considerable personal risk and became the object of Gestapo hunts and demands for arrest. He is shown going in and out of the Vatican in disguises as a postman, a trinket salesman, a nun, a street sweeper and even a Nazi Officer!  Christopher Plummer plays a Nazi Colonel who becomes obsessed with capturing the Priest, his ring and the secret havens for hiding POWS that O'Flaherty has in motion. In this role he does very well, although his hair seems a bit long for Nazi military men of that era. The screenplay is gripping, tense, exciting, and above all entertaining because it is true. Honestly, I can't understand how this was ignored or perhaps it is indicative of bias on behalf of film award councils because it concerns a true righteous gentile who aided Jews in WW 2 and was responsible for the lives of perhaps 7,000 allied and Italian people wanted by the Nazi regime. The film is a bit long but is worth every minute. An excellent drama!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The Good, the Bad & the Ugly is my all-time favorite movie, so my prejudices should be clear.  I had the previous MGM version that had 14 minutes of deleted scenes.  I bought this new extended version, and I'm very happy I did.  The quality of the restoration is fantastic.  The scenes added back in are fascinating for multiple reasons.  While their absence didn't prevent me from loving the movie as we first saw it in the USA, putting them back resolves some continuity glitches.  Why was Tuco alone, and then suddenly has three cohorts?  How did Angel Eyes know what area Carson would be heading for?  How did Tuco find his way to his brother's mission?  Etc. Also, simply getting to see something new after so many years and so many viewings was great.  The new English dubbing by Eastwood and Wallach (in those scenes that only previously existed in Italian) certainly doesn't sound the same as they did when they were so much younger, but I think it's really nice that they did it at all.  Bottom line, for me at least, is that this set was worth the money even though I already had a DVD of the movie.  I enjoyed watching it again, and yet again to listen to the film historian's commentary.  If you don't already have one, there's no question at all that this is the version to get.
B0000214F0|5.0|The film is good. The acting ain't bad and the grotesque scenes are just fine. <br /> <br />This film perhaps could've been better but people c'mon! take as it is....and it's good. <br /> <br />No sense in overanalyzing it. Just take it for what it is and enjoy it!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I saw this in the theater in 2001, and loved it! <br />I'm not happy the Japs attacked Pearl harbor, but <br />this reinactment was so well done! Everything was  <br />so authentic, the planes, the ships, the torpedos! <br />They did an absolutely incredible job making this <br />movie. If you have a good home theater system, you'll <br />love this movie even more. (A MUST SEE!)
B000002UVZ|5.0|It completes the circle, bringing a mix of the old, the new and Stipes great volcals front and center. <br />Raw, yet not raw and produced well, there is really not a clunker on the entire album. <br />This is a turning point for them, because Document came next which is sort of a refining of their heavier sound, but this record is the one that really moved REM out of college radio. <br />Everyone likes to be cool and say that Murmur is their favorite. <br />That's a good record, particularly for a first one, but it's not THAT great. <br />What came next after Document (also VERY solid start to finish) marks a big change in their sound, and for me, Out of Time was the last one I really cared for that still clung just a little to their original sound and power. <br />I appreciated the risk-taking, but their later records are just not even close to this strong.
B00008EY65|2.0|This movie had good special FX,<br /><br />but got boring pretty fast! Not<br /><br />the worst movie I've ever seen,<br /><br />but not the best either. Atleast<br /><br />the disc has good sound quality.
B000062YAZ|5.0|just to start off this guy hydonymous is really pissing me off,he says the same EXACT thing for every review he hates..he likes to use the phrase \\"echelons of their sanity,SERIOUSLY WARPED, and the music from hell\\"....dude...just shut up alright..i looked at your list of reviews...you bashed all the metal and praised all the techno DJ crap...if you don't like the genre then just shut the hell up and stop bashing it....now on to the review..it's a thrash classic and is an amazing metal album for the times,whether you are into new school metal or old school metal(you should already have this then)you'll love it,really faced paced metal to get ya pumped up for anything
B0007DAZW8|1.0|I bought this CD without question.  Homework...classic, Discover...21st century fusion....HUMAN AFTER ALL....i don't know how to describe it...to call it bad would be admitting it actually had musical content...This is the only time i will suggest this...find it somewhere, anywhere (download if you have to).  Listen to it past the 1st track... <br /> <br />Tracks 2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10...all the same song...slow intermittent technotronic radio signals? <br /> <br />Tracks 1,8 decent...possible singles with mixing quality. <br /> <br />This CD gets 1 star for each good song, therefore 2 good songs = 1 star
0792843584|3.0|During the fall of 1980, I was looking forward to the release of Michael Cimino's epic \\"Heaven's Gate\\", a story about the Johnson County War, an obscure piece of American History. As a huge fan of \\"The Deer Hunter\\", I was disappointed and felt cheated when this costly western was pulled from its original release date after critics annihilated the director's cut. When I saw the trimmed version of the film some 24 years ago, I was less than thrilled. With a newly critical eye, I just watched the DVD version, which has a run time of 3 hours and 39 minutes. Though the film still falters under the weight of its ambitious scope, the spectacular photography by Vilmos Zsigond is peerless and there are many scenes that were brilliantly directed. However, other parts including the Harvard Commencement sequence at the beginning of the film are interminable and should have been trimmed with a chainsaw. The much debated and historically inaccurate story is about wealthy Wyoming cattlemen assembling a death list of 125 immigrants they deem as \\"thieves and anarchists\\". Kris Kristofferson plays Marshall Jim Averill, who the audience first sees as a twenty something Harvard graduate with a life promise looming on the horizon. The story fast forwards two decades to a scenic Wyoming backdrop, where a disenchanted and burned out Averill uncovers the evil plans of the aristocratic cattlemen's association, drinks excessively and rekindles an on going relationship with a lovely prostitute named Ella Watson (played by French actress Isabelle Huppert). Also competing for the affections of Watson is hired assassin Nate Champion (played by a young Christopher Walken). Though interesting immigrant characters are introduced, they are not developed and we never truly understand why protagonist Averill has become cynical at the ripe old age of forty. Other plot elements and character motivations including Champion going from cold blooded killer to soft hearted suitor are confusing and countless other scenes including a painful rape sequence are overlong. In spite of some very solid scenes, the viewer wonders if Cimino ever heard of the term film editing. Either that or he fell desperately in love with his own work, originally submitting a five hour plus version to studio executives. The climatic battle sequence between the poor settlers and hired killers is ambitious, extremely violent and ultimately falls flat, leaving the viewer feeling it was pointless. Not because violence begets more violence and resolves nothing. To the contrary, it is futile because we are not allowed to care enough about any of the characters who the director keeps at a distance. I can see that Cimino painstakingly endeavored to create a masterpiece and on a visual level he was partially successful. The story telling is where the director fails to hit the mark. The supposed plot of the grasping upper class inflicting oppression and murder upon the poor settlers seems only to serve as a convoluted pathway to illustrate a life misspent by protagonist Averill. By the end of the movie, the audience has witnessed an extraordinary carnage of practically every other character in the film. This only to see rich man Averill sailing on his yacht and lamenting his pointless existence; ultimately married to a Harvard class beauty introduced only briefly at the beginning of the movie. Again this bizarre existential payoff is apparently supposed to justify to the audience why money and beauty cannot buy happiness. Incidentally, the real Jim Averill was lynched in 1889 and I am sure he would have preferred Cimino's melancholy ending. Finally, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is worth watching to see the unraveling ambition of a director who had a great picture in his imagination but never realized it in a tangible fashion. Not a life misspent, just a bloated budget and the career of a promising young film maker.ther scenes including a painful rape sequence are overlong.

B0002IU988|1.0|This cd is crap. It's a bunch of recycled riffs and vocal ranges. Don't get me wrong though, Tremonti can tear a guitar to pieces, and this new sucka Myles has some decent pipes. But come on, they should have called the band what it really is. Watered down Creed riffs featuring a guy who sounds like Eddie Vedder. Save your money.
6305428220|3.0|There's nothing outstanding about this movie, and it was never going to be something that people will rave about in the horror movie world. I like it however. It's fun to watch, even typically, most of the teenagers, are played by 'kids' in their twenties, and Josh Hartnett as the worst hair ever!<br /><br />The best actors in this are definitely the lovely Shawn Hatosy & Clea Duvall, although I dunno what to make of Clea's hair - is it greasy, or as she overdone it with the gel? Love the eyeliner too!<br /><br />During the cast pictures at the end, the science teacher who was 'killed' in the film is shown very much alive with a patch over his eyes and bandages over his fingers.The female teacher who was decapitated only to have her alien-controlled head rejoin her body, is seen (also very much alive) wearing a scarf<br />around her neck, presumably to hide the scar.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie, Marybeth refuses to take the alien drug test by saying she's allergic. Jordana Brewster's character Delilah says, \\"Yeah, and I'm Portuguese.\\" In real life, Brewster can speak fluent Portuguese.<br /><br />Jon Stewart plays Prof. Edward Furlong in this movie. Actor Edward Furlong played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, chased by the T-1000 Terminator played by Robert Patrick (Coach Joe Willis).<br /><br />Look out for Salma Hayek as a very ill school nurse in this, and Piper Perabo as an unrecognisable teacher.<br /><br />This is a good movie, better than some teen slasher flicks that Hollywood keeps churning out every so often. This film could become reality . . . :)
B00008DDXC|4.0|A good adaptation, with one major flaw - how is the audience supposed to know that it was Ginny who opened the CoS? The writers/directors left out all hints of her involvement and disappearance. We only get the brief hint when Lucius Malfoy replaces her books into her cauldron in the bookstore and the recap at the end. We have no instances of her finding or writing in the diary, nor does anyone find her missing during the times she's gone into the chamber. <br />Other than this plot flaw (kind of important), this adaptation is great fun, even if it at times plays down to the audience with too much \\"tell\\" narration. The entire cast does another great job, the kids oftentimes outshining the adults, and the choices of newcomers to the wizarding world in Kenneth Branagh as Prof Lockhart is hilariously spot-on and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy dead brilliant.  <br />I wish they would've kept in the fight between M. Malfoy and M. Weasley in the bookshop, though, that would have been great to see!  Other things that have been changed were IMO unnecessary (the additions of \\"new\\" spells such as the ones Hermione offers, having her destroy the rogue bludger) and some of the completely left out material a sad loss (i.e., the Gryffindor's Quidditch team's outrage at Draco calling Hermione a mudblood), especially to fans of the book and \\"purists\\". <br />The Chamber of Secrets is only the beginning of the darkening of the material, and the director did a great job of instilling a sense of dread without being too heavy or scary for younger kids.  <br /> <br />The extras disc is always great fun, filled with great deleted scenes (some should have been kept in. The others mercifully cut), and fun games. Yes, I play them, and I'm 25. <br />The interviews could have been longer and more substantial for older viewers, but they're great to have as they are.
B00005Y228|4.0|Buy it for the album cover, it is better than the songs.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I know that Green Day has always been here, but I haven't heard a good album from them since Dookie. I am glad to see their punk influence is more apparent than the pop sound from \\"Time of Your Life\\" which was annoying. Overall, I really like sound on \\"Holiday\\". It rocked and with all of the poppy crap that is polluting the airwaves, it is nice to hear something DIFFERENT. Billy Joe Armstrong has a good voice and it works well with the guitars. The lyrics are deep and the sounds on this album are amazing.
B0000033TE|5.0|Brain Salad Surgery defies time.  It is still awesome. Emerson Lake & Palmer were the greatest!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I think this soundtrack is amazing.  Especially check out  <br />RUFUS WAINWRIGHT's track on this album.    You just won't regret it.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I'm sure I'm just one of many lonely 30 somethings that want to look to the past because the present state of television is more sad than funny and is generally unwatchable. I have wanted to try so many of these old shows out but just didn't want to take a $40 plunge only to be unhappy. Enter Netflix. While this may seem like a plug for the company it really isn't, for I have to actually BUY the sets I love from Amazon:) So far it's been pretty hit or miss, each time I just try the first disc to get an idea of \\"the show\\" in question.  <br /> <br />Kung Fu was the first and I was pleased, making a mental note I must buy that series as soon as possible and still plan too. Then came Baretta and honestly Blake is quite good in that but the show isn't that strong, plus his wacky costumes are simply silly. Next was SWAT... it was dull, flat, and almost made me rethink the whole thing... can you go home? I have a deep love for Columbo because that IS on in reruns but the above shows just seemed to lack THAT level of likeability... <br /> <br />Then Starsky and Hutch Disc One Season One came. I thought \\"well it can't be any worse than SWAT.\\" Within 10 minutes of the pilot I knew I had found gold. Instant chemistry, humor, action, and decent dialogue abounded. Hard to describe my jubilation, kind of like a miner who had hit a vein I suppose. When these older shows are good, they are great. I fail to see how it is possible to cast a show and have it seem like the leads have been raised together! Paul Glaser and David Soul are just perfect. It's no different than Kirk and Spock, Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton, and many others that simply HAVE IT. As far as casting this type of thing, it is no doubt luck, OUR good luck:) <br /> <br />Well, after watching that first Disc I quickly sent it back and KNEW I HAD TO buy this set. This show simply put is everything I watch TV for. Having gone through the first 2 discs and peeking at the extras on Disc 5 I couldn't be happier. The Fix andKill Huggy are stand outs and while I could complain that they didn't remaster the sound in 5.1 like a MUCH older Star Trek ('66-69) I think I'll just be happy to have found new friends and leave it at that.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The album should be lauded firstly for the effort in and of itself.  Sadly, we just don't hear this kind of sound in music as much as we need to and should.  IQ points are dwindling among many today's younger listerners who don't know any better and merely listen to whatever is thrown at them.  Rodriguez is providing a valuable service to those willing to listen to his art.  Needless to say, Frances harks back to the conceptual period of 70's rock, but I don't really recall any Latin influence being infused into the sound albeit Santana.  This is great. The album goes all over the place even bringing out a strategy common to jazz: improvisation made seamless.  Rodriguez and co. give us a bunch of sh** that becomes one hellacious bouillabaisse of music composition.  The spots I find problematic are the overextended cacophonies (with current bands like Radiohead, Wilco, Sigur Ros, etc. even using them, they kind of almost seem cliched) though I know many times these may be necessitated to consummate the story or bring out effect.  It's also been mentioned before, but SOME melody I think helps you to reconnect with your audience just in case they've gone adrift since you're asking a lot from them to engage something expansive and esoteric and/or difficult to follow.  A nice melodic song could serve as a break as truly flawless albums like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" have proven (with the latter I consider to be the best prog. rock album of all time).  All in all, if you're new to this kind of stuff, quit wasting time and get educated.  If you're a seasoned listener, I'm sure you will agree that, although Frances isn't perfect, it affirms why you love to listen to this kind of music in the first place.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|HEY I DON'T LIKE HER MUSIC AT ALL, SHE IS JUST ANOTHER JESSICA SIMSPON, BUT I GAVE HER THE FIVE STARTS BECAUSE SHE IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST WOMAN ON EARTH, OH MY GOD SHE IS SO HOT....
B000002KIE|5.0|I think you have to be a genius to come up with lyrics such as \\"she was a girl from Birmingham, she just had an abortion...\\" I love it, I hate it. Rotten gets on my nerves like few people and I do think he is deranged but I freaking love the guy. This album was the \\"reset\\" button of the late 70s. At first listen, it sounds stupid and untalented, then 20 years later, you listen to it again and realize this is truly one of the greatest album ever cut and I can't believe how well it aged. Bollocks !
B000008LL1|5.0|Thunder rocked with the best bands from the 1990's. Word on the street is that Thunder is still alive and well a dozen albums later and they have/had a reunion tour just after 2000. Danny Bowes had the vocal chords to power out a hard rocking song, as well as sing those 80's style power ballads. Their albums are extremely hard to find... most are out of print in America and now only sold in the states as imports. While perhaps their biggest release in Britain and Japan, \\"Backstreet Symphony\\" (1990) found only limited success here in America. \\"Symphony\\" spawned perhaps their biggest hit \\"Dirty Love\\", as well as the slower ballads \\"Love Walked In\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\". As good as the slower songs were, I liked Thunder because they could rock the house... check out \\"Girl's Going Out Of Her Head\\". Thunder joins the ranks with other select rock bands that had something to offer, but for whatever reason just didn't cash in here in America; like Mr. Big, Kix, Firehouse, Junkyard, etc. A fantastic rock album from an underrated British band. Seek this one out!
B000000WHX|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" I remember turning my head, wide eyed, towards the radio and <br />asking myself \\"What the hell is that !?\\" This Bristol Wildbunch's release left me speechless. <br />Did we forget what a breath of fresh air \\"Blue Lines\\" was ? It is possibly the best album I own (certainly of the 90s). It moved me and it continues to do so. It was nothing short of revolutionary, uplifting (certainly compared to later releases) and it withstands the test of time surprisingly well. <br />I am puzzled at some of the harsh things some had to say about \\"Lines\\". This album is essential.

B00005JKZ3|4.0|...and MIBII delivered. I'm rather surprised at the negative reviews I'm seeing here, since I haven't talked to anyone personally who didn't enjoy the movie. <br />  For me, Frank the Pug's appeal came largely from the fact that he was an eager promotee into a new role, and seized it with all the enthusiasm of a dog -- while vehemently insisting he *wasn't* a dog. And the voice and attitude perfectly matched the face. It's not just a talking dog, folks -- it's an alien, and a personality. That's not all that easy to create with a nonhuman actor.  <br />  Tommie Lee Jones' role here is as a *deadpan* comic -- you're complaining that he's \\"wooden\\"? -- he's *supposed* to be. Geez. <br />   Agent Jay is burned out as an agent -- burnout makes you snarky and sarcastic. Will Smith is playing a role, not \\"being rude to white people.\\" It's not about race -- it's about personality, and since Smith is an actor, he is creating a personality, not fitting into a slot. He does a pretty good job of taking Agent Jay forwards a year or two, after the fun and glamour have worn off the role. *Agent Jay* is tired -- not Will Smith's acting. There is a difference. <br />   I did not find Michael Jackson's cameo funny, I'm afraid -- the poor guy's made himself into a real alien, and I just found it pathetic and sad. <br />   The special effects were perfectly fine for this movie. The humor of a Victoria's Secret model taking over the Earth should be obvious. The scene where Kay and Jay go into Kay's old apartment and open the secret wall behind the family watching TV is definitely one of the highlights of the film. <br />   If you are interested in the characters, I think you'll enjoy the film. If you are easily \\"bored\\" by lack of novelty, go watch something else.
B000000OSG|4.0|This music is great! Great followup to AFD and UYI1. Civil War, <br />Knocking on Heavens Door, and You Could Be Mine are classics that <br />I could play over n over again 3 times in a row! 14 Years is also <br />good, but overated. In my opinion, Estranged is the weakest song <br />on the entire album. Oh well.
1592400876|1.0|Truss's book is a disappointment for Americans who love the subtleties of grammar, punctuation, and good editing.  Her inconsistent picking and choosing of the rules makes no sense.  A warning for students:  do not buy this book as a guide, and don't follow its examples when writing your papers unless you wish to see a sea of red markings along the margins.  You'd be better off with Strunk & White or the unfailing Chicago Manual of Style.  In all fairness to the author, this book reflects British, not U.S., grammar.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is the best hard rock album ever! The songs are totally amazing! Every song rocks! This is definatly a must have for any <br />CD collection! Let me review the tracks now. <br /> <br />WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE-Great opening song! The vocals by Axl are <br />amazing and the music is great! An instant classic! <br /> <br />IT'S SO EASY-This song is also good but not as good as WTTJ.  <br /> <br />NIGHTRAIN-This song rocks! One of my favorites on this album. <br /> <br />OUT TA GET ME-Great rock song! This is what the radio needs. <br /> <br />MR BROWNSTONE-Oh yeah! One of GNR's best songs ever! This one <br />opens great! The vocals are 100 percent and the whole song is 100 <br />percent. <br /> <br />PARADISE CITY-Great, great opening. Slash did good work and Steven does great on vocals. One of their best songs of all time. <br /> <br />MY MICHELLE-This is one of the heavy songs on this but not as <br />great as Paradise City. <br /> <br />THINK ABOUT YOU-This song goes fast! The vocals are really cool. <br /> <br />SWEET CHILD O' MINE-You know this one! This is GNR's best song <br />behind NR! The riff by Slash is amazing! Vocals by Axl rule! <br />One of their most famous songs ever! <br /> <br />YOU'RE CRAZY-Not totally their best but goes really fast to get <br />you working.  <br /> <br />ANYTHING GOES-Good but what's a harmonica doing? <br /> <br />ROCKET QUEEN-Great song, their best drumming behind PC does amazing. But it closes kinda weak. Although yeah! <br /> <br />If you buy this album, I'll reccomend you to get 'On Every Street' in addition to this if you like this CD! <br />
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Want One is probably Rufus Wainwright's best album as of yet. It's more diverse than Rufus Wainwright and Poses. There really aren't any weak spots to be found on this album. As always there are brilliant songwriting and beautiful production. A must have for any Rufus fan, new or old.
B000002G9S|5.0|All right now is one of the greatest hard rock songs ever! <br />Buy the cd or download it from ITUNES if you like that song.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|Those who weren't fans of the chamber-like elements in his self-titled debut can find solace in this album. Poses is a lot more raw than Rufus Wainwright, the barest being \\"In A Graveyard.\\" Those who are fans of it, however, won't be disappointed, either. Rufus accomodates to that in \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,\\" \\"Greek Song,\\" \\"Poses\\" and ect, only it's bit more toned down. <br /> <br />My only complaint is \\"Shadows.\\" In my opinion, this album would have been much better off without it. <br /> <br />\\"Across the Universe\\" is a nice addition, and while it is a great rendition, the version he does on the I Am Sam Soundtrack is better.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Buy this just for Coyote! Don't listen to any of the other tracks <br />Coyote is one of the greatest songs of all time ever! The horns <br />are really the best! I can play this song over n over again 4 times in a row! Better along with STP.
B00008977N|4.0|Four stars, not five, because the video quality is not crystal clear. (By the way, Growing Up Live has great video quality).  The sound quality is very good on a 5.1 system (both Dolby and DTS).  Yes, the sound quality of the 5.1 tracks on regular stereo does not transfer well.    However, Peter Gabriel knocked it out of the park with this concert.  In a word: Stellar.  To me, this concert is the gold standard for all modern rock concerts.  It is that good.  Secret World Live represents a very unique ability to take two albums (So and Us), and combine them to create a new conceptual piece.    Call it rock opera, call it performance art, or just call it great music, it is all of these.  Great passion and emotion are the hallmarks of each song.  It is so good the two CD set is just that much better after seeing the DVD.  The band and back-up performers are great.  Paula Cole's performance provides the sexual tension that pervades many of Gabriel's songs.  The interaction with regulars Tony Levin and David Rhodes is great.  The energy and pure joy of the performers is incredible.  There is even a magician's trick with the band disappearing into Peter's suitcase as the final act of the regular set.    This is one performance where you can't help but say \\"I wish I could have been there\\".  This is great artist at his absolute peak.
B000002MJR|5.0|This is a hard headbanging album! Heavy Fuel and Walk of Life are <br />2 hard rock metal live rocks that I could play over n over again. <br />This album kicks my head out to my feet listening to Heavy Fuel <br />a thousand times live against to the other version. This version <br />is great to the other version. Money for Nothing Live is okay <br />but the other version is slightly better. Same thing for Calling <br />Elvis. I reccomend this live album to SOSTVBODS, and OES. <br /> <br />I also feature this item to Backyard Baseball 2005.
038572179X|1.0|This book held my attention for the first few pages and then was so incredibly boring that I brought it back to the library. I'm glad I didn't buy it because it would have been a waste of my money.<br /><br />What didn't I like about it?<br /><br />The fact that it just kept repeating itself and prattling on ad nauseum.<br /><br />Not my cuppa tea.
B000002P74|4.0|I want to get Second Helping, it'll be a good match to you! I'll <br />only be listening to Sweet Home Alabama, and Call Me The Breeze. <br />Thier best song ever! WAY BETTER TAHN PRONOUNCED LENERDSKINERD
B0007CNXUK|5.0|i personally enjoyed this movie because it made me feel like a child again though i am only 21 yrs. old. It stimulates the imagination, Depp and Winslet are superb, and the final revealing of Neverland scene just gives me goosebumps and makes my imagination soar as once before when I was younger... It is a \\"drama\\" but i have to admit, maybe it's because i am a Depp fan that made this movie that much more lovable for me. I don't know but i recommend this movie. It's sweet.
B000000OSE|5.0|This is GNRs best behind AFD! In my opinion, I get this album for <br />2 songs like November Rain, and Paul Macartney! November Rain <br />is a track I can listen to over n over again 4 times in a row. <br />The best song ever! Don't get me wrong, way better than Sweet <br />Child. The riff is so amazing! This is what you definately need. <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This was recommended by my brother due to the fact he knows how I love great horror films. The storyline was very captivating and everything seems to fall into place as the storyline continues. Really not that graphic too, I like scary films but not too much gore..this had just enough to get the point across. Really creepy, I think you will like it..turn off the lights (if you dare-I couldn't), grab the popcorn and settle down for a spine tingling good time.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time! <br />There are classics such as Smells Like Teen Spirit (One of my <br />favorites of all time), In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium. <br />Breed is not really their greatest but okay! If you want to see <br />my new greatest hits CD with this song here's my list. <br /> <br />1. Same Old Song and Dance <br />2. Sweet Emotion <br />3. Seasons of Wither <br />4. Money for Nothing <br />5. Heavy Fuel <br />6. Civil War <br />7. Sweet Child O' Mine <br />8. What It Is <br />9. So Far Away <br />10. Slow Ride <br />11. Coyote <br />12. Mr. Brownstone <br />13.

Heavy Fuel (Live Version) <br /> <br />Anyway, get this if you are a fan to Hard rock.
0786915749|3.0|For what it was, I actually enjoyed _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ quite a bit. The story was very clishd. Of course, it was based on a role-playing game, so that could be expected.   <br /> <br />Dragons suceeds as a young adult novel; I think it would be a great book to use to introduce younger readers to fantasy. It's a very readable book, nothing is complicated about the writing style, and you pretty much get what you see at face value when it comes to the plot.  <br /> <br />_Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ did have some plot points with which I take issue. Several plot points totally rip off two of my favorite fantasy books: _Lord of the Rings_ and _The Book of Three_. If you really are going to take the concept from another author, be sure not to take the concept's name. That's just a bit blatant. <br /> <br />Secondly, I didn't really care for the names. There were two different characters who went by very similar nicknames: Tanis and Tas. It was rather confusing. <br /> <br />Thirdly, I personally like it when important characters are killed off. Call me a sadist, but I think it makes the story much more interesting if this kind of shock is thrown in. Think of Psycho, Marion Crane's death really draws the viewer in the story. I very nearly threw the book across the room when one character in _DoAT_ sacrificed herself and then was magically resurrected. The plot would have been much more interesting if the rest of the characters had to deal with the grieving of losing her. <br /> <br />Finally, there was a race of small, fearless bipeds known as kenders. Whenever the kender member of the band was mentioned he reminded me of the annoying Honeycomb critter. I didn't realize until about three-quarters of the way of the book that kenders were humanoid. The descriptive writing could have been just a bit more in depth.  <br /> <br />If you decide to read _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ and the rest of the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy, I hope you enjoy it despite the flaws. <br />
B0000029AP|5.0|Get this if you are a fan to Aerosmith! I'll get you to like others such as GET YOUR WINGS and AEROSMITH and PERMANENT VACATION. PUMP is a need also! Faves maybe Sweet Emotion, Adams <br />apple, and Walk This Way. Okay ever1, please read all of my reviews since I'm a bit of a hard rock heavy metal kid.
B000646MNE|3.0|This is really more a review of the DVDs than the show itself.  Without a doubt, Sex and the City is some of the best adult TV ever produced -- so well written and acted (except, perhaps, for Season 5, which is only so-so by comparison).  Sex and the City is 5 stars + insightful, meaningful entertainment.<br /><br />That said, the video quality of the first couple of seasons is rather poor (like a cheap VHS-->DVD transfer).  Very grainy.  Hardly any significant extras come with the DVDs.  Maybe this is what one gets when the whole series goes for just $200 (one of the most amazing bargains around).<br /><br />If you are concerned about video quality, I might wait until a better reissue.
B00000DGUY|5.0|This album is the best album ever! I rate 5 stars on it! The music is so great. The weakest songs are Private Investigations, <br />and Brothers in Arms. My favorites is Heavy Fuel, Money For Nothing, and Tunnel Of Love. ROCK ON STRAITS!!!! <br />  <br />1. Sultans of Swing          10/10 <br />2. Lady Writer                9/10 <br />3.

B000002GBD|4.0|The title track is incredilble. The whole album is great. I remember how big this album was because I was a teenager in the 70's.  A lot of reviewers have said they didn't like \\"Love Hurts\\", but I suspect if it weren't for the fact that AM radio played this to death for many years and the probability that a lot of the reviewers here weren't even around when this ablum was released, this song would be much more appreciated. It was played at all the Jr, High and High School dances from 76' until I graduated in '79. How I remember! And my classic rock band I'm currently in includes it in our playlist when we need a classic slow song for the couples to reminisce thier youths by. And to all you 80's kids, this was NOT what you would call a power ballad! On the downside, CW is correct, it could use a bit more cowbell....
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is my favorite DS album behind SOS! 5 songs rock! It has <br />hard rocking Heavy Fuel, and metal zone, Bug! This album creates <br />also greats such as Calling Elvis, On Every Street, and When It <br />Comes to You! If you are a fan to Dire Straits, then you will <br />most likely will need this album.
B000092ZYX|2.0|It's tough to write a review for Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\". Not because my feelings about it are particuarly conflicting but because of how impartial I am to it.<br /><br />I guess I should start by saying that this record is indeed better than 2001's meanderingly awful \\"Amnesiac\\" in pretty much every concievable way, but it isn't as good as the decent \\"Kid A\\". And that should say that it defintley isn't in the same league as the bands one-two punch \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Ok Computer\\". So that pretty much leaves you with a middle of the road record.<br /><br />But it's a little more deceptive than that. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is a middle of the road record, but then again so where the last two. Each record since \\"OK Computer\\" have been hailed as genius, yet none of these records live up to any sort of hype. Are we supposed to love this record because we're told it's great. I think not.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this record is that after a single listen I implore you to remember anything that happened of any consequence. There are three great songs on this record: the guitar driven \\"2+2=5\\" and the records lead off single \\"There There\\", that sound like classic Radiohead, and \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\" that is the best electronic driven song that these guys have produced yet. But besides that, I can't remember a single thing about this record.<br /><br />Sure I know you're supposed to listen to a record like this a few times, and I did, but still nothing. Even the most meaningless tracks on the last two records(\\"Treefingers\\" from \\"Kid A\\", the entire \\"Amensiac\\" record) had something that were memorable, either for the good or the bad, but \\"Hail to the Thief\\" has nothing of either. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is for all intents and purposes elevator music, or muzak as it is not so lovingly refered to as.<br /><br />Look if you're looking for a mood record, which is what this record appears to want to be, then you should go with Sigur Ros or even Aphex Twin, or why not replace your broken \\"OK Computer\\". I really dobut that you will listen to this record more than a few times before getting three dollars for it in credit, two in cash at your local used C.D. store.I really dobut that you will listen to this record more than a few times before getting three dollars for it in credit, two in cash at your local used C.D. store.
B00003CXCT|4.0|For those who don't like the new \\"improved\\" versions of the saga, there are always the VHS tapes.  If you didn't purchase them without the 97 changes, you may still be able to find them on ebay or elsewhere. <br /> <br />I personally don't mind these new editions, except for the obvious discrepancies listed by others.  However, I am with most people and would like to see the original on DVD minus all new \\"enhancements.\\" <br /> <br />Enhancements really don't sell that well by their own merit.  Take the Alien movie that was released recently (last year?)  Didn't do very well.  Gibson's Passion redux - ???  Some of these movies just don't need redone.  PLEASE - leave them alone.  What's next, Indiana Jones get's CGI and adds a tiger running after Ford in the opening scene of the movie (instead of the huge boulder)?!?
B000031WBV|5.0|Rubinstein's is the Chopin I keep coming back to - simply exquisite.  This album is the best Nocturnes recording.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I've heard over time that a lot of Offspring's fans find this CD to be a sell-out. What can I say? I have the \\"Smash\\" release, and I love it, too. \\"Americana\\" is full of energy and humor. What's not to love?<br /><br />\\"She's Got Issues\\" is hysterical, wreaking of truth. The same can be said for \\"Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)\\" and \\"Why Don't You Get a Job?.\\" The CD flows nicely from the one song to the next. Just because it's catchy doesn't make the band a sell-out. Sometimes the best thing a band can do is acknowledge life experience. With experience comes change.<br /><br />Without question. I believe that Offspring is one of the best contemporary, punk style bands; that includes their release of \\"Americana.\\"
0553573403|1.0|I read this book followed by the second and about half of the third  (before being too revolted to continue) and I have to say I'm surprised by the rave reviews.  This isn't a fantasy book, its more akin to horror than anything else.  The series became predictable in its own way.  A disaster will happen.  Every character will end up mangled, mauled, and mistreated without fail.  Just like the hero that always saves the day, in this series, life will always get worse.  Maybe this book is popular because gore, violence, and sex have become so popular in the modern world.  I don't know.  As for me though, since attempting to read this series, I haven't picked up a single new fantasy book.  I used to like fantasy, but if this is \\"good\\" fantasy, then I'd rather stick to something more cheerful, like cyberpunk.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|Josh Rouse really beefed up his resume with this album.  His previous recordings were mostly folksy pop with a southern feel, and each album took small steps forward from its predecessor.  By the time \\"Under Cold Blue Stars\\" came out, he had seemingly perfected his craft, and built on it with strings and horns and so on.  Though \\"1972\\" is not better than \\"...Stars,\\" it is so radically different.  Josh's 70's sensibility was not overtly present in his previous recordings, and while he doesn't completely grab the 70's sonically, he seems to have captured the spirit, and that makes for a fun listen.   His unusual, yet captivating, storytelling makes the mellow groove of the title track sound even better.  \\"Love Vibration\\" is a bouncy delight and as close to the 70's as he comes on this record, complete with a great sax solo.  \\"Sunshine\\" is a sweet love song full of California influence.  A few songs are just average in the middle of the disc, though \\"Come Back\\" picks up the slack with its almost-disco romp, complete with prominent strings and even a jazz flute.  \\"Under Your Charms\\" is an atmospheric and gorgeously orchestrated piece, fit for a movie soundtrack.  The album's finale (\\"Rise\\") is perhaps the best song on the album.  It contains a line that befits Rouse's music: \\"It's an honest thing, and honest things, they last.\\"
B000002L99|4.0|The Van Halen fan base seems to be divided into two camps.  I always like both versions (I'm not counting the Gary Cherone fiasco as even being Van Halen) equally.  I have always felt though that Van Halen seemed more like a \\"band\\" with Sammy, they all just seemed to get along so well onstage.  This is arguably the best CD from the Van Hagar years along with For \\"Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\".  Some people feel the band went to \\"pop\\" on this album. This analogy usually comes from DLR loyalists who feel Diamond Dave can do no wrong.  But it is no more \\"Pop\\" than 1984 with \\"Jump\\" and \\"I'll Wait\\".  \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Get Up\\" rock as hard as anything from the DLR years.  \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" are also underappreciated tunes.  \\"Love Walks In\\" is a great \\"Power Ballad\\".  Sure the sound of Van Halen changed with Sammy and in my opinion extended Van Halen's career.  Face it as good as \\"1984\\" and \\"Fair Warning\\" are the sound of Van Halen was beginning to stagnat.  DLR was not a very versatile singer so the band had to keep doing the same songs over and over.  With Sammy they were able to do songs they never could have done with Dave.  As I said before I love both the DLR and Hagar years and 5150 was a great begining for the Van Hagar years.
B0006399FS|5.0|Are you also one of those people who feel that their last overblown, overrated and overhyped album was just not that good? well me too, dammit, and now U2 makes a cd as good as anything they did in the 90's and people seem to be either loving it or hating it. I really don't think there is anyone in the middle of this one: personally, I love it. I love every song here except for \\"All Because of You\\" (just too bland), \\"Vertigo\\" (too overplayed) and \\"Yahweh\\". If these 3 songs were not on the album, it would rank with War and Unforgettable Fire as one of the best. No joke.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth are back with the follow up to Zos Kia Cultus and this cd blows that one away, nergal's voice sounds like that of an angry god!, my first impression was that these guys were going to just copy themselves with this and i was wrong, they are heading into the realm of epic death metal thats right up there with nile, morbid angel,necrophagist,serpens aeon, and mithras. This sounds like the soundtrack to the end of the world with thundering drums and technical swirling guitar lines and slithering grooves to, these guys are all great musicians and definately know how to get sick sounds from there instruments. I recommend this cd for anyone who wants to take a journey when they listen to there music and escape from the harsh reality.
1400032717|5.0|i was in the bookstore one day, itching fo rsomething interesting to read when i came across this book. It was orange and i like orange and it sounded interesting enough so i picked it out and bought it. To my surprise it was absolutley wonderful. i could not put it down. I read it about 3 times and i didn't let anyone read it. if you buy this book, you will not regret it. It is wonderful. ABSOLUTLEY GENIUS! It was inceredibly insightfull, and it made you think, but not in an annoying way.
0316172324|3.0|This book is about the all important two second decisions or impressions that our \\"adaptive unconscious\\" leads us to without the rigor of detailed analysis that we otherwise do. Instantly, I realized that my decision to buy this book from amongst a large display at  a book shop  at the local airport was one such \\"blink\\" decision. <br /> <br />The author introduces the concept very well. I was immediately convinced that it is important to realize the power of \\"thin slicing\\" and the need to understand and cultivate the skill of harnessing its power in personal and professional life. The quantum and the degree to which it exists and manifests differs significantly in each of us. The book aims to explain the phenomenon, situations under which it is mostly right or consistently flawed and the means by which one can build on this powerful mental resource.  <br /> <br />The chapters that follow are exciting with numerous cases across diverse fields that can interest a wide range of professionals. As the pages flow, it appeared to me that this was a case of discussing the concept more and more without following a systematic framework for analysis and application. No doubt the case studies are interesting, but then the objective of the book should have been beyond narration of stories and to build and present a powerful tool for successful deployment. The author does discuss one such model used by doctors in a hospital for diagnosis of heart attacks which substantially improves the chances of correct diagnosis. <br /> <br />Worth reading once. However this can wait till you finish reading other books in your priority list.
B00003CXPD|4.0|This British film is much like many other contemporary British films billed as comedies (like The Full Monty or Brassed Off). They chronicle (even if in the backdrop) dying industry, layoffs, unemployment, labor problems: truly depressing things. Upon first viewing of these films, I am struck more by the palpable sense of hopelessness that exists in the background, even if the main story of each film is meant to be hopeful. Depressing circumstances take several attempts to get past in order to see the funny or heartwarming story within. In this case, a boy's father (a man's man miner) scrimps and saves during hard times (a mining strike) to send his son to boxing lessons. The son instead discovers he is both more interested in and has a talent for ballet and uses his father's money for ballet lessons, lying to his father about what he is doing. When it becomes clear that his talent goes well beyond what the teaching in their northern English town can offer, Billy's instructor suggests that he apply to study in London. Family problems thus ensue, with both Billy's father and brother (both striking miners and \\"macho\\") criticizing Billy, barring Billy from this \\"homosexual way of life\\", etc. In the end, Billy triumphs, perhaps because his talent is too great to deny, perhaps because his father finally sees that this a ticket for Billy to avoid the kind of hard and uncertain life he has had to endure.
B000008L90|3.0|I am a great fan, but this is not one of Donna Summer's more memorable albums. It is well produced by Michael Omartian but lacks the timeless songs that are found aplenty on her better works.<br /><br />There Goes My Baby is a pleasant ballad where her voice gets a chance to soar, but most of the tracks sound very similar. The style is a kind of 80's Pop/R&B without the dance beat. The torch song Forgive Me has lovely piano and the title track is vaguely sensual, while the opening number Supernatural Love is embellished with impressive synth infusions.<br /><br />But overall, the album is rather tepid and lacks spark. It is with a measure of reluctance that I award it a third star. Perhaps it deserves only two and a half. I recommend the albums Bad Girls and Once Upon A Time to those wishing to hear Donna Summer at her peak.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|Here we have mindless entertainment brought to us by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. It was in fact not as entertaining as I might have hoped. Although I found the tale of two competing male models who eventually join forces to be not quite as funny as it could be, the scenes of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) visiting his father and brother (played by Jon Voight and Vince Vaughn) seeking their acceptance but not getting it rather funny... later when Voight cries in acknowledgment, \\"That's my son\\" as Zoolander unleashes his new \\"look\\" is also amusing, but that is all I can say for this film: it is mildly amusing but nothing I could not have lived without.
B000001E18|5.0|I purchased this album on cassette when it originally came out in the summer of 1993. I hadn't listened to it in several years until recently when I got the CD version on sale.  <br /> <br />After all these years, I still find the album as fascinating now as I did then. It was a best selling album as well as a chart topper featuring the hits \\"Numb\\", \\"Lemon\\", and \\"Stay Far Away So Close\\". Other noteworthy tracks include the title track, \\"Babyface\\", \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay...\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\" with Johnny Cash singing lead with U2 in the background. There's hardly a weak track on this album. <br /> <br />Anyone new to the band should try this if they haven't already. Whether or not this is as good as previous albums like \\"October\\", \\"The Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby\\" is a matter of opinion. But without question this is has to be their most daring. It had only been a year and a half after \\"Achtung Baby\\" was released and this follow up proved they were still at the top of their game. <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Ok so this film wasn't great. It also wasn't terrible. The most redeeming quality however was the plethora of scenes with Brad Pitt half dressed. I'm speaking solely to the ladies here. I'm sure there were some fine shots of the heroines as well but I really didn't notice. Sorry guys. As for the story I think we all know how it ends and getting to that ending would have been much more tedious if it weren't for all the eye candy.
B000667GFK|5.0|I think that this CD is perfect. My favourite songs are: <br />Luz de luna <br />El Viajero  <br />Mexico en la piel <br />Que seas feliz <br />Sabes una cosa <br />....... <br />Luis miguel is excellent singer.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|So, it's 2005 and Halford's back in Priest. You expect big things right? Well, \\"Angel of Retribution\\" which I expected to be really good or really bad is neither is mediocre at best. The songs that are good are really good, the songs that suck really suck.  <br /> <br />The general sound of the album is a lot like Painkiller (90). Some of the songs have too much compression used on them. A little too much treble on the middle-high end. The production is alright though.  <br /> <br />Since there is no other way to do it with an album as strange as this, here is a song by song breakdown. The first song is alright. The second song (\\"Devil\\") is pretty good, mainly because of its simplicity. \\"Revolution\\" is some power metal song with some extra cheesy effects. The fourth song is a retarded ballad.  \\"Demonizer\\" returns to that winning Painkiller style. \\"Wheels of Fire\\" isn't that great of a power metal type. \\"Angel\\" is a god awful ballad -none of the work on the song is good. \\"Hellrider\\" returns to the winning style of double bass and the demonic heavy guitar riffs. \\"Eulogy\\" is unbearable, they even brought out a piano for this one. \\"Lochness\\" isn't bad but is WAY TOO LONG clocking in at 13:29! There aren't enough change ups to justify the song being that long. The lyrical content is almost impossible to get past. <br /> <br />Overall Downing and Tippon's two guitar attack works enough to keep the listener interested. Halford voices hasn't changed at all throughout the years and his delivery is probably the best part of the music on this album. The bassist... The drummer from Painkiller days Scott Travis does a good job of keeping the beat and he really holds the album together when it looks like it's gonna fall apart. The lyrics are so ridiculously cartoonish that even if you try to ignore them you can't. I usually don't pay attention to lyrics but these are right in your face here. <br /> <br />All in all, a mediocre effort that is ridiculously expensive. Got mine at BBand it was only $11, this CD ain't worth $17-20. Maybe the next album they do will be better constucted.
0452282152|1.0|SO BORING BEYOND BELIEF.  I HATED THIS MOVIE.  IT WAS WAY TOO SLOW AND UNCAPTIVATING BY ALL MEANS.
6305903182|3.0|The beginning of Scream 1 was good. Scream 2 was boring and this one was just okay. I actually thought I would enjoy it more than Scream 2, and I did. The story gets confusing to me, but only the best scenes are with the killer. Scream 2 had one good scene. That's it. I quite enjoy it's soundtrack but you can leave it's movie to someone else who likes it more than I do. In this one, NO ONE knows who the killer is. I knew even before I saw this movie so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it all that much. Horror movies aren't my thing very much anymore than they use to be. Oh well. Believe it or not, this was the best one, but I'm afraid it's just not as good as everyone says it is.  <br /> <br />Scream 1: The best part was the beginning. <br />Scream 2: Not enjoyable like I was told it was.  <br />Scream 3: Okay, and the best...and ONLY OKAY.
B000002H2H|1.0|I don't have much to say about this cd, there's only one good song on this album called 'Fight Fire With Fire', the rest just sucks. I don't recommend this album, cause it will disapoint you very much. When you here the first track, you probably think I'm wrong, but what did I said? I said the first song is the only good one! The rest sucks! So save your money on this one!
B00000I8UJ|5.0|This was, I think, Dexter Gordon's proudest session he ever did. The second to last album he made here in the states before he packed up his bags for Europe to gain a wider and more acceptice audience.  <br /> <br />Dexter Gordon has always been one of my favorite saxophonists. His sound is warm, not as deep as Sonny Rollins, and more heavy than Hank Mobley, Dexter was his own man. He had a style all his own, and demonstrated them on a vast number of fine albums for Blue Note in the early sixties.  <br /> <br />I think the only other equivelent to Gordon's Go album is Dexter Calling. A fine work by all who participated, but back to Go.  <br /> <br />Cheese Cake, written by Gordon is an endless flow of ideas, originality, dexterity, and fine horn playing. One of the best \\"B\\" sections I ever heard.  <br /> <br />As the boys groove through Second Balcony Jump, the music is very effective. The unique (for a Blue Note album at the time) rendition of Love For Sale, is definately a highlight on the album. And so is the ballad, Where Are You. <br /> <br />The musicians on the album are all great too. The underrated, Sonny Clark, who recorded this album in the last months of his short life, was at the top of his game. His ideas are expressive, innovative, and provocative. He is the color that comes from the nifty quartet. The stride piano opening line by Clark on Three O'Clock In The Morning reminds me of the opener Miles Davis used to have pianist Red Garland do for the opening of \\"If I Were A Bell.\\" Garland also did it with his own trio. (Red Garland's Piano, circa 1957) <br /> <br />The Rhythm section team of Butch Warren and Billy Higgins must have been a dream to play with for Gordon and Clark. Billy Higgins was being used around this time on a lot of Blue Note sessions. He had made his mark with Ornette Coleman in 1959 a couple years earlier.  <br /> <br />The sound quality could be a little better, but with the exceptional music, one does not seem to notice, but the rivet cymbol overdose is a killer sometimes, when it sizzles through all the other instruments.  <br /> <br />It is no wonder how this album made its way to compact disk, but just be greatful for it.  <br /> <br />Dexter Gordon lives on!
B00005K3NR|5.0|You can make an argument that the most horrific moment in \\"Carrie\\" comes in the beginning when Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in an Oscar nominated performance) is in the shower of the girl's locker room at Bates High School and gets her period for the first time.  Carrie is so ignorant about her own body that she has no clue as to what is happening and thinks that she is bleeding to death.  Her classmates have no way of knowing that because they have largely ignored Carrie her entire life, but their reaction is that of a pack of vicious wolves attacking a wounded fawn.  We do not need to know anything about Carrie in order to have sympathy for her and to despise her attacks.  But Stephen King's story ups the ante because one of the young girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving) has an attack of conscience, which makes the rest look even worse, although Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), an original \\"mean girl,\\" does not need such help.<br /><br />Certainly female viewers are going to respond viscerally to this opening scene.  Like the unforgettable scenes in \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Jaws\\" it is about something horrible happening when you are naked and vulnerable.  But it is also comparable to the chest buster scene in \\"Alien\\" in that the initial attack is internal.  That there are so many common elements between these classic horror scenes undoubtedly speaks to something significant, but we will save that for another day.<br /><br />Another key element of the horror story is that Sue tries to make amends.  Some find her decision to punish herself by making Tommy (William Katt), the boy she loves, take Carrie to the Prom to be somewhat unbelievable, but it works in this film because of the look on Amy Irving's face when Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) reads the riot act to the girls and Sue finally gets the depth of the wretchedness of their act.  Besides, their prom tickets are in danger at that point and throwing something away before it can be taken from you is a teenage art form (one that I mastered and used early and often).  This also adds an additional level to the horror because not only does Carrie's pink prom dress get ruined by all that pig's blood, so does Sue's act of contrition.<br /><br />This attempt by Sue establishes a contrast with the way that Carrie's mother, Margaret (Piper Laurie in another Oscar nominated performance), treats her own daughter.  A religious fanatic warped beyond the limits of caricature, Margaret is a monumentally abusing mother who wraps her attacks in the language of righteousness.  Ironically, her treatment of her daughter is a twisted example of an act of contrition, as Margaret seeks to atone for what she considers to be a sin.<br /><br />There is a blatant link between the blood of the shower scene and the shower of blood at the prom in that each serves as a catalyst for Carrie's telekinesis.  The first time it is for her powers to become active, as she learns when for the first time in her life the dirty look she gives to someone making fun of her are no longer impotent gestures.  At the prom this becomes the dam bursting, and what is key is not simply the image of the blood drenched Carrie but the wide-eyed look that Spacek gives us in one of the create close-ups in horror movie history.  Her attackers have gone too far and there is a juvenile sense of justice to the fact that she responds in kind.  You know that a lot of innocent kids die in that gym that night, but silence assumes assent and it can be argued that they are culpable to some degree with making Carrie's life so miserable.<br /><br />But we are so invested in Carrie as a character that the bloody climax of this 1976 film produces mixed feelings.  She gets to pay back her tormenters, an idea that virtually all high school students can relate to, but she goes too far, another inherent trait of the teenage psyche.  It is wonderful and horrible at one and the same time.  But when Carrie claims her final victim our sympathies are engaged again because the tragedy here is that what happened is not her fault.  Carrie White is culpable for her crimes, but the primary responsibility is not her own and the final justice of the film is that the person who is most responsible pays.  However, the final image is of another teenage girl damned for all time because of forces beyond her own control and the idea that no good deed goes unpunished is a rather horrifying final point for the movie to make.<br /><br />Granted, this is not a flawless horror film.  Director Brian De Palma has too much fun with the camera at times, as he is wont to do, such as when he over does the split screens during the gymnasium scene.  What works well to indicate that Carrie is using her powers to slam shut the doors works well, but then it just because too much.  Then again, the boys dressing up for the prom is a nice bit of levity before things go to hell, and filming in reverse Sue Snell's walk to visit Carrie's final resting place is a nice subtle effect.  Whatever failings the film has, such as Laurie's way over-the-top performance and the forced symbolism of her character's crucifixion, the best moments in \\"Carrie\\" are some of the most memorable in the history of horror films.  There are just too many body punches in this one to justify rounding down.again because the tragedy here is that what happened is not her fault.

B00003BDXG|5.0|This movie gives off mixed reviews, since most people can't see through the murderous rampage the movie takes us through. This a typical Tarantino movie, even though Oliver Stone picked it up, meaning that you have to like gore, violence, and sex a whole lot more than the average Joe. I feel the cast was perfect for the topic, Juliette Lewis has always done a perfect job at portraying mental patients from retards to maniacs. Woody Harrelson also a superb job as serial killer...but my favorite has to be Robert Downey Jr. (the 'do anything for a story reporter')he's the one who gives the movie a comical touch, along with Tommy Lee Jones who plays the uptight and over confident warden, at the prison where the killers are being held.     The movie's camera angles and weird effects help get the insanity across, this may catch a lot of you off guard...  In the end the movie requires effort from the viewer to get its point through, which is to mock and portray an exagerated view of the American obsession with tragedy, and its corrupted media.
0723284075|5.0|When I was a young child we had many (all?) of the Beatrix Potter books. My favorite was the gruesomely fascinating story of the cat (naughty, of course) who was rolled up in pie dough by a rat family, narrowly escaping being served as dinner.   <br /> <br />As to content, I suppose the stories do tend to be a bit drastic in their portrayal of the inevitable consequences of naughtiness, maybe a little old-fashioned.  On the other hand, if the conjuring of rats dressed as people administering justice to naughty cats dressed as people helps shape my son's understanding of the expedience of obedience, about choice and consequence, so be it; my direct admonishments (lectures?) certainly seem to bounce off his mighty 3-year-old teflon shield. And it beats telling him that the police are going to come get him, which is a favorite threat to children here in Germany (Go figure!  Scary!!). Then again, perhaps I've got it all wrong, and the books were meant actually to celebrate mischief.   <br />  <br />Anyway, these have the old, familiar dark green cover under protective book jackets, with pages of thick, shiny, resilient paper. Great illustrations, no dumbed-down language.  The box is also really nice. My three-year-old boy is captivated by them. This box set is of heirloom quality, I'd say.  Nice gift (thanks, Grammy)!
B00002E224|4.0|what a beautiful surprise of a movie. watched it without any expectations, but the smart dialogue centered movie captures the hope, idealism, the youthfulness that builds like a fantastic date and by the end of the movie you are in love. the restrained and understated unfolding of connection between delpy and hawke happens at times quirky, sometimes awkward, and at moments beautifully like the real thing that the viewer is convinced, or at least i was. i've never been in love but i felt that strange passion and connection between the two towards the end of the movie like i was a part of the romance. beautiful.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|I think I have to agree with many of the other reviewers here when I say that this is not the phenomenal album that Songs for the Deaf is. My first disappointment was the lack of Grohl's drumwork on this one. My second disappointment sits in the first few songs. I think they're too punkish, too dependant on a single driving riff. That being said, after that this album lights up and just freakin rocks. There are some really juicy sleazy, good songs on the latter half of this album. I'm also really glad that there are none of those annoying little radio blurb things from Songs for the Deaf. Worth buying.
0316172324|1.0|the basic thesis of the book is as follows: intuitive decision making (snap, blink, or unconscious) can be more effective than scientific/analytical decision making IF we train them to be less biased. it's an interesting point, especially in  our culture of scientific determinism, but did he have to take 260 pages of anecdotes to argue that? and isn't scientific knowledge/study exists to remove those inherent biases which he so vehemently argues against?     it reads like many of the self-help/business strategy books - pseudo-psychology/pseudo-sociology, which has pseudo-valid point(s).    more interesting than the theis of the book are the various anecdotes ranging from vic braden being able to predict double faults in professional tennis players to police accident in brooklyn, which are much more entertaining and educational than the premise and the argument of the book. buy it read it if your blink decision tells you to, which probably tells you that you have a very flawed and biased subconscious: like me. but i have a copy for sell if you do.
B00030GMO0|5.0|It's been a really LONG time since i've liked 90% of the songs in one album... if you're a fan of the 80's alt days you will most definately love this one... <br /> <br />buy it!
0064407667|4.0|The three Baudelair children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny suddenly lose their parents in a tragic house fire.  Being children they must have a guardian to watch over them.  The children are sent to their very very very distant cousin, Count Olaf, to be raised.  Olaf is a pathetic excuse for an actor who is out to steal the Baudelair childrens' fortune and doesn't care one wit about the conditions he sticks the children in.  Because of it, they suffer...and nearly lose their fortune as well. <br /> <br />The Bad Beginning is a somewhat witty introduction to the Baudelair children and their adventures (this is the first of at least eleven books).  Count Olaf is a suitably despicable villian that the children must thwart and they do so, if not always easily, at least intelligently. <br /> <br />One really does tend to feel quite badly for the Baudelair children.  They obviously had a wonderful home pre-fire and very loving parents.  The underlying tension between the children and Olaf is a distinct lack of affection, going both ways.  Though the children do find affection here and there from other caring individuals and amongst themselves.  (They certainly never fight amongst each other as I did with my sibling at that age!) <br /> <br />The Bad Beginning a fun children's book, but it does not transcend the genre as Harry Potter does.  One can't help comparing the two.  Both are involving stories, but it is much easier to see how an adult may not enjoy this book as much as a Potter book.  Please don't let this discourage those adults out there reading this review...it's just fair warning.  Nonetheless, I anticipate continuing the Baudelairs story as soon as possible.
B00005JGAB|5.0|There are very few artists that can say that they single-handedly pioneered a musical genre.  The Ramones did just that with this album. This album was a phenomonal first of many classics that this band would make during the next 25 years.  The album is raw and not nearly as polished as others that the band would make as they got more recording experience. It does, however, show more than mere traces of the greatness that was to follow.   With little more than three guitar power  chords, ripped blue jeans and black leather jackets, the Ramones brought to the world an unchartered sound that pre-dated even the earliest wave of Britishpunk.  Many say that without the Ramones there would be no Green Day, Blink-182, etc.  I would go even further and say that without them, there would be no \\"alternative\\" (and I use that term loosely) or modern, post-modern, etc, of any kind.   <br /> <br />The Ramones dared to delve into territory that the world had never heard blending \\"sludgy,\\" slightly nihilistic guitar with catchy pop melodies that could sometimes be as sunny as the Beachboys.  It is a true talent (Johnny Ramone, R.I.P) that can make so many memorable and different songs with such a limited number of guitar chords.  Being way ahead of their time, the Ramones were not to see what little mainstream success they had until almost the end of their career.  This band is a very important part of musical history that will be enjoyed for generations to come.   <br /> <br />As for the ignorant and uninformed comment made by In Flames 666, you are forgiven.  As someone who champions death metal (which I personally consider the bottom feeder of all musical  <br />styles), you probably don't know any better.
0385510438|2.0|I'm normally not the type to go for Irving/Grisham/Clancy novels, but stranded in the Raleigh/Durham airport, I decided to venture into new territory. The review blurbs on the book from the NYTimes and others all glowed that this was Grisham's best work ever. It was \\"atmospheric\\", \\"tonal\\", approaching true \\"literature\\". I was sold. <br /> <br />I quickly finished the novel and set it down with a sigh of relief--relief that I'd finished the damn thing and relief that I had never subjected myself to other Grisham works. This novel was light on anything of legal interest, lacking in interesting suspense, and of dubious effect when it came to the verisimilutude of the two main protagonists.  <br /> <br />There was nothing wrong, per se, with the novel; but by the end I was completely unmoved. For those who say that this novel is great despite lacking in legal suspense, fine; but if you want a good literary narrative than go read a real novel.  <br /> <br />
B00018D3JQ|3.0|On paper, I thought this record would encapsulate everything I hate about some contemporary music, with its tendency towards glib pastiche, gutless irony and clueless appropriation. So it's with not a little surprise that I'm forced to report back..... this works! And I speak as someone who knows and loves the originals. Reinterpreting these classics from a feminine and non-british perspective brings out interesting new aspects of the tunes and foregrounds their melodic strength and lyrical sensitivity. Some skate onto the thin ice of novelty - in fact, I usually miss the first few (pretty lame) tunes out and play the disc from \\"Guns Of Brixton\\" onwards, but that doesn't mean the record overall is without merit. Some are really affecting - \\"Making Plans For Nigel\\" has a real pathos, \\"Marian\\" and \\"In a Manner of Speaking\\" are wonderful, and (my personal favourite) \\"Psyche\\" takes the anger and hysteria of the original and reworks it into a version that drips with controlled menace. Personally, I think the whole bossa tag puts a kitsch/ironic spin on expectations of this project that's unjustified. Ignore the carpings of purist punk dullards and the sniggerings of cloth-eared hipsters - give this baby a spin with an open mind and you'll be in for an interesting and enjoyable ride..
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I ever bought.  The first five minutes or so will drive you crazy, but it just provides contrast for the rest of the album which will blow your mind.
B000002LOE|1.0|this cd completely sucks.  I was never a big R.E.M. fan in the first place, but I do like Monster and Automatic and most of Green and Murmur... but this album is terrible.  I can't possibly listen to the whole thing in one sitting, and 'Shiney Happy People' really makes me want to punch someone.  This is the worst money I've spent on music since I had to buy a NKOTB tape for my sister.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Binaural is a good album, no doubt. But it is Pearl Jam's worst album that they have put out. Sure, I enjoyed most of the songs on it, but I didn't LOVE very many of the songs like I did on their other albums.  <br /> <br />\\"Grievance\\", \\"Gods' Dice\\", and sort of \\"Insignificance\\" were the tracks on this that I will play almost every time I listen to it. Why I say \\"sort of\\" for \\"Insignificance\\" is because I like the majority of the song except for a section in it where Eddie Vedder mumbles something about iron being in your blood, which is pretty much stating the obvious. <br /> <br />But I'm rambling. What I mean to say about Pearl Jam's 2000 album is that it is a good listen, but it is for one nothing like what they used to make and also features the worst song they have ever made, \\"Sleight of Hand\\", not to mention the fact that on this, like Riot Act (their next and most recent album), Eddie Vedder sounds perpetually tired and weary, which cuts down on the rocking of the album and adds a lot more acoustic tracks than usual. Some are good (\\"Soon Forget\\", \\"Thin Air\\") and some are bad (\\"Of the Girl\\", \\"Parting Ways\\"). <br /> <br />But what one can't deny is that Pearl Jam has never been afraid to do what they want, and if Binaural is the direction they wanted to go on, then so be it. It is a good direction, but not great like their older sound.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|While it doesn't have the hooks of Songs for the Deaf or the riskiness of Rated R, the new brew from Homme and crew does what its supposed to - make my neck sore, my hands crampinto permanent devil horns and my neighbors call the cops. There are plenty of gems on this disk, contrary to a previous review, but some will sparkle more for the die-hard fans than the newly baptised. Lullabies to Paralyze will probably bring more followers into the fold and undoubtedly they will find even more inspiration in the previous gospels of the Queens but it will not convert them as quickly or as plentifuly as did Songs for the Deaf, which owes thanks in part to three great singles, two great videos, and a hell of a lot of coverage by the media surrounding Grohl's much hyped return to the stool. As for those of us that have been here for a while, the dark forces of the desert rock are strong in this one and shall feed the masses until the next serving. <br /> <br />
B000002UAO|4.0|Another overrated Beatles' album. Btw, do you ever notice how the critical reviews are short (often less than the paragraph), while those gushing praise are, well...a bit longer? Well, here goes my 'brief' analysis of Rubber Soul. <br /> <br />Forgetting this was a Beatles' record, the album itself is good to very good. By the Beatles' standards, however, it is only medicore. Like most of their albums, there are a few very good songs, while the rest are only good (with a few shockers). This one is perhaps better than about half of their albums (eg. Revolver, Sgt. Peppers), and not quite as good as others (Abbey Road, Hard Day's Night, White Album).  <br /> <br />First, the good. While pop for the mainstream, Rubber Soul WAS experimental. Norweigen Wood, one of the album's better track introduced us to the sitar and 'Indian sound' (although of course the Beatles' didn't invent this sound, but merely stole it from Indian music). The best song, by far, is the slightly mellow 'Nowhere Man' which ranks as one of their best. 'Better' songs include In My Life and Michelle, while the rest are pretty medicore and simplistic. They did not possess the strong melodic hooks vital for this type of music, and so the record did not achieve potentially legendary status it could have.  <br /> <br />
B00005JKCH|5.0|this movie was an amazing \\"tranlation\\" of the comics. with the help of the original creator of the comics, who also created the X-men comics, i think they pulled off a wonderfull and timeless movie. the acting was overall alright and the action was great. a definite weekend movie to kick back and watch with the family......
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Jane Austen's Persuasion, her last great novel, comes to life in great perfection in this 1995 film version. Starring Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, this version of the classic is certainly admirable in both performance and faithfulness to the work itself. While the story is both a satire and a drama, the pervading question that surfaces is: what can we do when we let someone important slip away from us? For Anne Elliot, she must not only live in the present, but deal with a past love when Captain Wentworth resurfaces in her life years after their failed love.  <br /> <br />One of the great things about this version is not only its succinctness, but the great effort by the cast. While the movie is barely over one hour and a half long, it still keeps much of the relevant plot within the script. There is not a sense of dragging the story around; we get right into the main issues of the work and the story shifts rather quickly. The cast itself was also commendable-for instance, Anne's sister, Elizabeth, who is played by Pheobe Nichols, comes across perfectly as someone who is a bit snobbish and only concerned with the issue of class and reputation for both herself and her sister.  <br /> <br />Another successful aspect of the film is the ability to depict accurately the social values that are so crucial to the book's relevancy. For example, we really get a true look at how much family pressure made a difference in determining marital values, as is demonstrated in the case of Anne Elliot and her family's wishes that leave her feeling guilty and frustrated years later.  <br /> <br />The most essential aspect of filming a classic is to bring forth the vitality of the book, and this one does this successfully. We see the story of a woman who must try to put her family's wishes and other's interferences aside in order to find what is truly essential to her well-being.  Anne must also fight through the frustrations of others interfering insomething that is paramount to her own life-love.  <br /> <br />
B00004BZ0V|4.0|No fan of The Clash is going to have a need for this CD and likely has every album already. But if you're not a fan of The Clash and think you might want to be, pick this up. And don't listen to Hawkeye or whatever his nickname is. Every song on here is great.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Having never seen the musical performed on stage (and knowing only bits and pieces of the story) I was eager to see the original Andrew Lloyd Webber songs and storyline played out on screen.  I had to know what the hype was about -- after all, it's the most recognized musical in history.  I know the songs far better than I know what the songs are about.    While it is a rare double-threat to be a great actor and singer at the same time, it's not impossible (I.E. Julie Andrews, Barbara Streisand, Liza Minnelli).  I kept thinking, as I watched, that there must have been a tremendous amount of pressure placed upon the filmmakers to cast an artist who can do both, and do both well.  Here, the creators seem to have opted more for the acting slant versus vocal ability -- and I agree that was, perhaps, the better of the two talents to emphasize in the film version.  Still, I can't help but think there might be a perfect young Christine out there waiting to be inserted into this production, and certainly there is an actor/singer who could hit the Phantom's notes without a rather annoying rustic, country-rock squalor?    Emmy Rossum, the actress who takes on the role of Christine here (whom you may remember from \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\") is a decent performer with a history in musical productions.  She can sing fine (though I find it hard-pressed to call her a possible opera star, unlike Sarah Brightman for whom the role was penned in 1985 by then-husband Webber).  She doesn't sing strongly enough to make me believe that she could command an Opera stage.  Gerard Butler, who plays the Phantom, seems like a melodramatic resident from Melrose Place who decided he would like to start a rock band, but opted to live like a recluse in an Opera House's basement and somehow  train pretty young girls to sing like, well, Sarah Brightman.  Strange casting in the role of the Phantom, as much as I enjoy Butler's other work.  Patrick Wilson, who plays Christine's legitimate love-interest,belts his songs out fine, if not dry and uninspired.  This is a film that makes the concept of real singers singing the parts and then real actors mouthing those pre-recorded tracks seem like a better idea; everything music-wise is a tinge too mediocre.  It's as if a decent filmmaker is attempting to produce an album.    The cinematography shines.  It's a beautiful film... most of the time.  The sweeping camera shots, warm, vibrant colors, spectacular sets and costumes, and antique French charm is often entrancing.  The Paris opera scene comes to vivacious life.  Yet, the cumbersome black and white flash-forward scenes are treated with as much emotional depth as a Madonna or Prince music video from the 1980's.  It's when we're at the stage, back stage, and in the audience of the opera house -- watching elegant fake elephants trot across the stage and chandeliers crash to the ground in a fiery blaze -- that the movie comes together in the finest way.    If you're a die-hard fan of the stage musical I can't imagine that you'll be terribly blown away with this big-screen interpretation.  If you're curious as to what story fits the fantastic original Webber tunes, you might like to check this one out on DVD.    Grade: C
B0007KTAU4|5.0|Carla Bruni is pretty hot. She is beautiful. She has my attention. She could be a contender on America's Next Top Model. She was a model already when she was younger. She was born in Italy. She went out with Mick Jagger and Donald Trump. They have excellent taste. This is one of the best French language records released this year. Carla Bruni sounds like Jane Birkin and looks like Milla Jovovich. Jane Birkin actually already interviewed her. They spoke about her cover song \\"La Noyee\\" by Serge Gainsbourg. Bruni almost covered the song \\"Sois Belle Et Tais-toi\\" which means, \\"Be beautiful and shut your mouth.\\" Carla Bruni wrote most of the songs on this album. It is an accomplished folk album in French. It has sold a million in France already. Carla Bruni is up there with Keren Ann for records done in the French language. She is ready to take over the USA. Hopefully Mick Jagger won't be around as her sidekick. This is a cool record.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Let me begin by saying that the album is highly unusual.  Looking at the selection of songs, the album seems to be an oddity until you begin to listen.  Cash's voice and the sparse instrumentation combine in a way that connected with this listener on a deeply personal level.  The music seems to be Cash's vehicle to express what he felt and understood at the end of his life that does not neatly fit into words alone.   <br /> <br />I like all the songs, some more than others, but the masterpiece here is \\"Hurt\\".  Once you hear it, it is unforgettable.  I don't know what it is about Cash's performance of this song that affects me so, other than to say it does.  I heard it for the first time on a flight, one of those where you can build a playlist from onboard MP3's.  When \\"Hurt\\" came on, it instantly caught my attention and I found myself repeatedly playing it the the remainder of the flight.  It is the type of song that takes you into places you don't really understand other than to know they are real and a part of you.
0596009208|4.0|I found this book to be a lot of fun, and very easy (atleast until I got the variables chapter).<br /><br />My first problem with the book was that it didn't clarify what code to try out yourself (it even says in the beggning some of the code examples would not compile). I just sort of figured it out myself and used eclipse to run some of the code snippets and write some of my own examples.<br /><br />My other problem with the book is that in the beggning it uses examples with words like beer, cats, dog, bark etc.. but then in other examples they will use variables/classes/functions with names like main, run etc, or other words that I am not clear that THEY made up, or are ones that already exist. That is to me the most confusing part and the book is not consistant with that part.<br /><br />Please realize I have never done OOP before, but my husband has given me some pointers and helped me understand things.<br /><br />I am on page 50 or so which is way farther then I normally get in technology books. Overall I like the book and I think it's fun, I just think it could have used some more QA from newbies like myself! Most books I just never pick up again, I may have complaints but I am still reading this book!
B000001FS3|5.0|I had heard that this album is a must have, according to the \\"Top 500 Albums of All Time\\" of Rolling Stone Magazine. For once, I can say that Rolling Stones lists actually make sense. This album grabs your attention right away and does not let you go.  <br />The first three songs move. They are also the most famous. Like I have been reading in other reviews, it's not just those songs that make this album. \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is indeed a very beautiful and emotional song. \\"Exit\\" and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" are a great end to this album.  <br />For me, the song that stood out the most was \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\". The song built up throughout the verse, and it just exploded when it reached the first chorus of the song. After that, the song was just gorgeous, and it was the first time in a long time that was a drag to end. I had to listen to that one a few times. <br />The only point of criticism is the sound quality of the CD. The production on the album is very good, but it needed to be mixed a little louder. Seriously, when I go from this album to some other album, it's crazy how much I had to turn up the volume.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Well metal heads, this is a gem among boring wannabe's in the realm of hard rock/metal genre. It's sad that music execs seem to think that all contemporary rock music must have the same mundane monotonatic guitars and vocals. I grow weary of the Creeds, Chevelles, etc while in search of something new to listen to. Well maybe we need to go back to a sound that isn't new to begin with. This maybe the best Priest effort since Screaming for Vengeance. It seems as though Priest actually listened to their entire catelogue and figured out what made each effort succeed of fail. They took the best sounds and orchestration from their older albums, fused them together with the driving sounds of their later efforts and blew away the trash from their mid life kiddie rock hair band garbage. This is a fresh new album, searing from the riffs, yet deep enough to go off into headphone bliss with multi-leveled production we haven't heard since Screaming for Vengeance. Gone are the days of the dink, dink drumming of Dave Holland, this is blazing with the double bass lightning of Scott Travis, yet showcases his versatility to adapt to changing & varied sounds that has been missing from Priest for two decades. Priest shifts gears from thrash like jams, to driving riffs, to mellow ballads, and back again. This is not just an example of what metal used to be this is an example of what metal should be.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|The most discernable redeeming feature on the new Daft Punk album, \\"Human After All,\\" is the title track, and even that track's (exhaustingly basic) chord progression grows rather stale over time... certainly by the end of the 5 minute duration.     I hear no \\"One More Time\\" or \\"Around The World\\" equivalents, in fact I hear nothing that the mass musical audience can sink their teeth into; Daft's success in the past has hinged on their balance of avant garde and startlingly popular appeal. Catchy melodies are void on this disc, or if they exist they're so brief and repeated so frequently that the listener will begin to wonder if they'd been given a bootleg copy of this Daft release with nothing but 10 second loops for the duration of each track. \\"But,\\" the listener says to himself, \\"I bought it at Best Buy for 15 bucks.\\"     There's precious little development within these tracks. Daft latches onto a 5 second concept and attempts to build 7-minute tracks out of them -- in the past it worked because they were good concepts that were modified throughout the duration of a given track. The end result here is something that does its darnedest to drive you mad.     Additionally, the distressed nature of the album is comparable to spending $70 for jeans with permanent dirt and holes in them. However, in this case, there are so many holes and so much dirt that you're left with a pair of short-shorts that serve no functional purpose. Too much distressed pops and noises = bad. Where The Strokes made a mint of their lo-fi production habits, Daft Punk attempts to assemble as much intentional distortion on this one album than all the \\"The\\" bands have manufactured in the past five years. It's annoying, ineffective, and unnecessary is such high doses. It makes a shoddy album sound worse.     The second track on the disk, \\"The Prime Time of Your Life,\\" develops with some promise, but wraps up with the worst two-and-a-half-minute ending I've ever heard (and the song is only four minutes long).     \\"Robot Rock,\\" the first single, pales drastically in comparison to single releases from the previous dance-evolving albums \\"Homework\\" and \\"Discovery.\\"  In fact, it doesn't amount to an album filler from either of the first two albums; again, 5 seconds repeated to fit a whole track.     If minimal, ultra-looping dance is the direction Daft Punk is attempting to lead the electronic community, they'd better check themselves and research their own past efforts. What they've done in the past is so brilliant, so good, so alluring that they were bound to make a crappy record. Now they have, and now they need to get back on course.     Grade: D     \\"Homework\\" grade: B     \\"Discovery\\" grade: A
B00018D3JQ|4.0|This is some boss nova take on the post-punk era. Songs by Joy Division, Depeche Mode and others are given the lounge act treatment. It was a time of faux existentialism and unexamined greyness. This is music that informs the current cool bands like Interpol and The Killers. Those bands look at this period in awe. Interpol even toured with The Cure. That music did start out as obscure and underground. The Cure and Depeche Mode became really popular in the late 1980s. They were the only band with longevity. In the movie Repo Man, you have the band The Circle Jerks, which I have mentioned earlier, doing a lounge version of one of their songs. It was a sight gag about punk rock music becoming commodified. So I guess Nouvelle Vague is some comment on that. There were a lot of these types of records coming out ten years ago in the Ultra Lounge/Tiki Hut era of 1995. I am not sure that anyone will get this record unless they grew up with this music in their teenage years, like me, and possibly the creators. It's funny. It's almost elevator music.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Imagination, the source of creativity and essential for hope, provides an opportunity to dream of endless possibilities in life, as it is also a necessary tool for writers and storytellers.  The storyteller needs an imagination when creating new stories, which can help people see possibilities in dire situations when everything seems to be bad.  Children often use their imagination for play and games while adults frequently forget this marvelous tool for success as they drift into a life of responsibility and work.  The Scottish playwright and journalist Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) must have kept his inner child close to him as he wrote masterpieces such as Peter Pan that display his boundless imagination about a boy that did not wanted to grow up.<br /><br />Finding Neverland is loosely based on events that took place in J.M. Barrie's life commencing in the year of 1903 after his latest play turned out to be an expensive fiasco.  In disappointment Barrie begins to search within himself and his own imagination where he could discover new and better material for a play.  Frequent walks in the London parks lead him to bump into widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four children -- Peter, Jack, George, and Michael.  The children trigger his imagination as he begins to play pretend with the children which brings him dancing bears, cowboys, Indians, pirates, and crocodiles.  He brings his fantasy land to the children, a land he calls Neverland, to which he escapes in order to get away from the daily hassles and the responsibilities of being an adult.<br /><br />One of the children, Peter (Freddie Highmore), shows no interest in imagination or pretending, as he frequently spoils moments by pointing out reality.  Barrie brings it on his own shoulders to help Peter discover the possibilities of imagination, but it turns out to be a tougher task than what he first thought.  Nonetheless, Barrie remains persistent in helping Peter see the possibilities of pretending as they play in the backyard of their house.  It seems as if Peter is holding on to what is real, as he still suffers from the loss of his father.<br /><br />Barrie's close relationship with Mrs. Davies brings people to suspect that he has ulterior motives.  It also begins to affect his relationship with his wife who suspects that he sees the Davies in order to meet with Sylvia.  Others have darker and much more ominous imaginations, as they seem to believe that he has developed a fondness for the children beyond care giving.  Despite the allegations Barrie continues to do what he thinks is right, but it seems to bring further heartache and pain to the family as people talk behind their back.<br /><br />Caught between Neverland and the reality of adulthood Barrie has to learn how to balance both sides while it might hurt people involved in his life.  His wife complains that she never see him since he is always working by staring at a wall dreaming himself away in order to write, or that he spends too much time with the Davies.  The Davies have their own problems into which Barrie has arrived by generating a positive fantasy world where pain does not exist; however, reality is much grimmer.  Barrie is caught between a fantasy world where he always has answers and reality where he seldom has answers, as the possibilities are not as frequent as in Neverland.<br /><br />Finding Neverland is a poignant story of the power of imagination that is wonderfully directed by Marc Forster who also directed Monster's Ball (2001).  Performances by the cast are dazzling with brilliant actors such as Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, and Dustin Hoffman among others.  Depp's performance as J.M. Barrie is outstanding, which displays a very complex character.  The mise-en-scene and cinematography elevate the visuals, which are enhanced by a great script that leaves the audience with a truly touching and thoughtful cinematic experience.ilities of pretending as they play in the backyard of their house.

B00005AR3G|5.0|This movie is great for kids of all ages! I'm fifteen and i still love this movie with all my heart.  This is not your typical disney movie! This movie ROCKS!! You can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it! I confess, I have watched it so many times i know all the words by heart and can recite it to you. But thats okay since all my friends know the words by heart too! Never have i seen someone who watched this movie and didnt like it.  The best thing is that it never gets old. It's one of those movies where everytime you watch it you notice something new.  You will not regret getting this movie!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Who cares? If so, I am doing it because this album was just that awesome-tastic! That's mine, don't steal it! Anyway, it took me a while to warm up to this album, because at the time I was preoccupied with Amnesiac, which is also very lovely. After it had grown on me, I realized that every song on the album was enjoyable. \\"Airbag\\", for me, was cool with the sleigh bells. \\"Exit Music\\" was very dark, somber, but nonetheless cool. \\"Electioneering\\" was very rockin', I listened to it on the morning of November 2nd, a sad day, and the song really worked. \\"No Surprises\\" is a true Radiohead gem, and probably my favorite song by them to date. The album ends with the strike of a glockenspiel in \\"The Tourist\\". For some reason, I thought that was a genius way to end an album. Radiohead rocks my socks.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This film is one the most funniest films I ever see, the main character already worth the movie, Shaun is not a looser, he is a BIG looser but the great loosers are the great leaders (anyone remember dawn of dead 2004?). The movie is replete with memorable scenes, but the movie is not only about zombies and gore is about love and friendship, at last an instantaneous classic. Prepare your popcorn and enjoy it.
B0000255CL|4.0|This isn't black metal or death metal, it's viking metal! And it's really awesome! This disc is so epic, and the riffs are technical and \\"catchy\\". I love it!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|...Offensive to Japanese peeps, features spoiled, self-obsessed non-characters that you couldn't care less about, and is total rip-off of \\"Walk, Don't Run\\" (Carey Grant vehicle from '66), to boot.  <br /> <br /> <br />Think old Daddy-dearest Francis made Hollywood an offer it couldn't refuse...? Does he actually even HAVE any clout anymore???   <br /> <br /> <br />...And just how DOES a mostly-improvised movie win an Academy Award for Best Screenplay???!!!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />...Stuff to ponder, kiddies.
0688145078|4.0|We bought this book for our second son when he was almost two and we were expecting our third child.  He still enjoys reading this book although our new \\"baby\\" is over one year old.<br /><br />In the back there is a little bit of practical advice for the parents to use to help their little boys transition from being the \\"baby\\" to being the big brother.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is absolutely an incredible masterpiece. This movie is a show that delivers everything that you could ever possibly want in a horror movie. Hands down, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deliver extraordinary performances in this movie. It keeps you guessing all the way to the powerful conclusion to the movie. Don't hesitate to watch this movie. I gurantee you that everyone will find something to enjoy in this movie.
B0001LJC2K|2.0|I was trying to work the album title into.... Ah, Forget IT! I had heard part of \\"Apocalypse Please\\" or whatever it is in a coffee shop, and I was intrigued. Upon buying the album, I listened to one or two tracks and laid it to rest. I was sorely disappointed to the mediocrity of the album as a whole. The album did not grab me. Think of me as one of the things flying overhead on the album cover. Nothing about this album was overly enjoyable, or should I say a\\"MUSE\\"ing in the least.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I got this album back in 2003 after hearing so much about it. Once it started playin on my cd player then I realized what the fuss was all about. I had been waiting for an album like this for such a while and I thank the band for making it. I got so into them that I bought the japanese version here at amazon.com and was even impressed more due to their two extra tracks (Interlude and Specialist). I even reivewed it aswell.  <br /> <br />Check out Antics which is another great album from this band. They're truly one of my favorite now.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Who is that dude below me that thinks Avril is the hottest woman ever?  Avril Lavigne is the trashiest, sleaziest pop singer ever.  It looks like she hasn't bathed in ages.  She looks like a prostitute who sells her body to pay for her heroin habit.  What a trashy, sleazy, greasy dirtball.  Yuck.
B0000A118M|5.0|Overstated my title? No, I don't think so. For me this album is up there with the Rite of Spring by Stravinski and Axis: Bold as Love by Hendrix to name just two disparate yet amazing musically defining masterpieces.  When I first heard A Love Supreme in the early '80s, I wasn't a jazz fan, this album turned me around. Coltrane's tonal explorations and melodic sense was unlike anything I'd ever heard before and sounded truly modern and unconventional. I was hooked. That sense of exploration and innovation were not limited to Coltrane alone. The classic quartet of McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones had been playing together for about 4 years by then and it shows. Their interplay is telepathic. That I'm a drummer also helped me appreciate to a great degree Elvin Jones mighty contributions to this album. He's a polyrhythmic master who never played better than when he was backing Coltrane. Pianist McCoy Tyner, whose style is instantly recognizable, is still playing today and a master in his own right. Jimmy Garrison isn't the flashiest bass player but he's rhythmically nimble and fit perfectly and subtly within the quartet.<br /><br />Virtuosity aside, what truly hits me about this album is the emotion of the playing. This is one of the most emotionally moving albums I've ever heard, especially the first two compositions: Acknowledgement and Resolution. Tears come to my eyes; few albums affect me the way this one does. A Love Supreme perfectly illustrates Coltrane's then burgeoning spiritualiy.  The first three compositions are like an ecstatic religious experience put to music.  The album ends with the floating yet powerful Psalm that brings the listener gently back to earth.  A desert island disk for sure and a must have for any music lover. It's simply a defining moment in jazz, in music period.<br /><br />This is the album that made me truly listen to and explore the musical world of jazz.  Without having listened to this album I might never have found out about the music of Charles Mingus, Ornette Colman, Duke Ellington, Art Pepper, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis ect... Thanks John.c of Charles Mingus, Ornette Colman, Duke Ellington, Art Pepper, Art Blakey, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis ect... Thanks John.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|This is an absolutely incredible film. This movie delivers with the action around every corner. Kate Beckinsale does a phenomenal job in this film. This movie is definetely for anyone into vampires or werewolves. This movie is definetely for anyone into action. Even better, this movie is for anyone into both of these subjects. I would recommend that anyone and everyone give this movie the chance it deserves. I gurantee you will not bee disappointed.
B000068G9X|5.0|Yeah, Danzig! After he left the Misfits, He decided to form the most fiendish band Hell had to offer. The first track on the album is \\"Twist of Cain\\", a ghoulishy gripping... OK, can't do this anymore. I enjoy this album because I think it's kind of funny, even if Danzig doesn't. In fact, I have it good authority that nothing is funny to Danzig. Does he ever smile? A wise man once said, \\"Danzig needs a hug\\". I hate that wise man, but like this album. Danzig is a \\"Mother\\" of an album. Huh? Get it? Yeah, it was kind of lame, unlike this album, which rocked my socks!
B0002SROSQ|5.0|On this double CD album the Bad Seeds make a huge leap. Nick Cave is fully in his own voice now, fully in control, confident and he's finally arrived at those monstorous themes that he's wrestled with since, well, forever. I think his artistic maturity fully matches his ambition now, and the results are beautiful.    <br /> <br />In fact, a major theme of the album is the struggle to find your muse, and more importantly, what you do with the damn thing once you've caged it. T <br /> <br />It's as brilliant a singer songwriter album as anything released in the past forty years.  <br /> <br />
B0000067L2|5.0|Simply put, this is Cream's finest all around. Skip the Bonnie & Delaney, Blind Faith hooey and go straight to the source. This album (CD, whatever, it's called this week) is a veritable masterpiece . It has a myriad of musical styles to amuse and defuse. \\"We're going wrong\\" is a bit on the lame side, but suffice it to say this is one of the best 60's all around musical achievements. An excellent follow up is \\"Wheels of fire\\". Which delves into live and studio takes that hold up beautifully under the stress and pangs of time. Buoyed by Felix Pappalardi and Robert Stigwood's direction and musicality, you could do a whole lot worse. Face it, YOU WANT THIS CD. Treat yourself right. Get it. Get it?
0783227434|1.0|If, like me, you enjoyed A Knight's Tale, you could very well hate this movie.  It is the worst movie I have ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies.  Plan Nine from Outer Space was so bad it is funny.  Napoleon Dynamite was so goofy, it was hilarious.  Army of Darkness is so bad, it's, well, bad.  Bad in a very bad sort of way.  So bad, it hurt my feelings.  The special effects are cheesy.  The skeleton animation was jerky - like in the original King Kong when, seventy years ago,  there was an excuse for jerky animation.  Sometimes the skeletons were animated, and other times they were guys dressed in poorly costumed skeleton suits.  The plot was as coherent as a stuttering drunk choking on a olive pit.<br /><br />The movie begins with a scene where the hero cuts off his hand with a chain saw - and doesn't get much better.  Violence is okay, but, after long and deep reflection, I do not see how the hand severing contributed to either the plot or the character development.  I kept waiting for a tasteless pun using the word \\"disarmed\\", but it never came.  This, by far, was the best part of the movie.<br /><br />The dialog was supposed to funny in a corny sort of way.  It was corny in the worst sort of way. I got embarrassed and had to hide my face so others in the room wouldn't know I was watching.  No hidden chuckles.  No groans.  Just bad.  Bad like Mr. Whipple selling Charmin bathroom tissue.  Bad like the worst episodes of Gilligan's Island.<br /><br />Save yourself!  Run from The Army of Darkness.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day delivers us a very powerful and emotional CD with \\"American Idiot\\". Everyone can find something to relate to in this CD. Green Day is one of the most amazing bands ever and any fan of Green Day should never hesitate to pick up this awesome CD. If you are still not a Green Day fan, buy this CD and I'm positive you will become a Green Day fan yet!
6301969294|5.0|This film carves in relief with supreme eloquence the hazardous advertence about the everlasting conflict between the free will and the collective interest. An architect , a free creator of new spaces renounces to give up his ideals,  he even goes far beyond and decides to cross the frontier of the politically correct facing the public opinion .<br /><br />In those times the phantom of the collective welfare fed the mind of so many people; some of them absolutely convinced and other portion fondled the romantic idea as a possibility: but King Vidor saw with this entry the magnificent opportunity to make his own statement defending the free will and the creative gifts of the individual initiative above any other premise. He had given us that sublime masterpiece The crowd two decades before, to remark this fact. The image of Frank Lloyd Wright is obviously associated when you watch the film carefully. Lloyd Wright is in the supreme pioneer and most ambitious architect of  new paradigms in the arcane tradition of creative spirits and scientist such Edison, for instance.<br /><br />The speech given by Cooper when he appeals to the great Jury defending his most intimate beliefs, still maintain its actuality and possibly is the highlight of the film. The sequence in which we watch cooper leaving the office of Massey when he is hired to build the new see of the vanished Banner is simply exquisite and reminds once more the shadows of the German expressionism where the shadows of the betrayal and the triumph of the ideals are faced with all the merciless nakedness.<br /><br />A personal triumph and a serious warning for those who still believe in the collective welfare as an untouchable Credo simply due the man is not redeemable.
B000007U6V|4.0|In the Kraftwerk catalogue, Autobahn stands out to me as an anomaly. It's sunny and warm, with kind of a Teutonic Beach Boys feel to it. The eponymous track dominates the album, four german hippies take a roadtrip down the autobahn in an old mercedes. The track starts with a steady highway pulse then gets sunnier, almost as if you're entering the country. This Autobahn isn't about speed, it's a stretch of highway with no other cars for miles and cows on the side of the road.  <br /> <br />The album is devoid of the menance and irony of later releases and the band has pretty ditched the Krautrock muscle of the first three albums. It's a classic. It also doesn't sound like Kraftwerk.
B0006UYOJM|5.0|The Faces were underappreciated in their time, so much that their records were allowed to fall in and out of print. This album is arguably their best. It includes their biggest hit, \\"Stay With Me,\\" but tracks like \\"You're So Rude\\" and \\"Memphis\\" are every bit as good. <br /> <br />This was a great, rollicking band, with a reputation built on raucous, sloppy, and fun rock n' roll; the Faces often backed Rod Stewart on his own solo albums, particularly Rod's first four classic albums, but on their own records, they cut loose even more. On A NOD IS AS A GOOD AS A WINK...TO A BLIND HORSE, their playing is actually a bit tighter compared to other Faces albums, but it's still got the right amount of slop, and they play GREAT. <br /> <br />Ronnie Lane does a fine job singing lead on some of the tracks, but Rod is even better. In the early days, his singing was described as the male-equivalent of Janis Joplin, and this album is further proof of what he could accomplish before turning to mainstream, adult contemporary pop. <br /> <br />This gold CD is better than WEA's budget CD issue, and at $19.98 retail, it's not a bad deal (most gold CD's run about $30). The CD is HDCD encoded, so if you have an HDCD decoder in your CD player, it'll sound ever better, but even if you don't, this disc will sound GREAT. It sounds even better than Rhino's remastered box set, FIVE GUYS WALK INTO A BAR..., and like I said, this is a great album.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I was one of the first people to pick up this CD on the release date back in May. I was greatly looking forward to this release. When I had first popped it into my CD player, I was totally blown away by the incredible sound that emitted from my speakers. Avril delivers heart felt lyrics through all of her songs on the CD. You can just feel the emotion surging out of each and every song on this CD. Avril is also an amazing live performer. I have had the wonderful opportunity to see her live twice. I recommend that if you ever get the chance to see her live, DO IT! I also recommend that no one hesitate to pick up this CD today. This is an absolutely incredible CD and worth every penny. ROCK ON AVRIL!
B0007DAZW8|4.0|A lot of people say homework was their best album but i totally dissagree. Homework was a very good album but it was only something i listened to for da funk and around the world. the other songs seemed very unorginal and similar. with discovery, not only was every song different but orginal and fun to listen to. Even the slow songs like something about us or veridis quo were really great songs to have on the cd. Another thing about discovery that i really enjoyed was the songs with lyrics in them. They were really well done and I really enjoyed them. With human after all however it seems as though discovery's soft core and homeworks hard edge collide with their third album which I do really enjoy but I really wish there were more songs than just 9 (on/off doesn't count). Hopefully we Get another Album like discovery soon! <br /> <br />P.S. I hated the anime video's from discovery. I just hate anime
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Let me tell you, I was in a grand funk after suffering through \\"The Matrix: Reloaded.\\" I couldn't believe the Wachowski brothers took such a great idea and turned it into a lead balloon. The first Matrix entry was an ultraslick, hyperkinetic actioner that had me teetering on the edge of my seat for nearly its entire runtime. Everything clicked in \\"The Matrix,\\" from the intriguing and well-developed characters to the underlying story to the shock and awe special effects. The film even managed to use the action scenes sparingly so as not to overshadow the other elements, something science fiction and thrillers rarely accomplish. Then came \\"Reloaded,\\" and the gleaming gold of \\"The Matrix\\" rapidly turned into rusty iron. Turgid dialogue larded with enough philosophical mumbo jumbo to confound Plato reared its ugly head in nearly every scene. Lord Larry Fishburne, we quickly notice, is turning into this generation's Marlon Brando if the weight gain is any indication. And then there's the action sequences ramped up to insanely high levels. It's like the Wachowskis tried to outdo their own creation and instead created a film that should have bolts in its neck and green paint splashed on its face.<br /><br />It was with some trepidation that I hit the play button on \\"Revolutions.\\"  I quickly realized I shouldn't have worried. While the film still boasts enough muttered hokum to make your eyes spin around in your head, it is actually quite suspenseful and entertaining. Even professional boat anchor Keanu Reeves can't completely sink this effort. We come into \\"Revolutions\\" with the impending attack of the machines on Zion looming like a dark cloud on the horizon. Neo's in trouble again, of course, and is trapped in some subway station between the world and the matrix. Fortunately, he has a cute Indian family and some sinister chap named the Trainman (Bruce Spence) to keep him company. Obviously he won't stay there long thanks to his buddies Trinity and Morpheus, who kick some serious you know what to get their boy back in the game. It's nice to see the sleek and sexy Carrie-Anne Moss return to her character's roots, that of a hard charging warrior who just happens to look great in black leather, even if it lasts for only a few minutes. Needless to say they manage to spring Neo from his subway platform prison, and not a moment to soon: Zion is gearing up to fend off the machines and they are going to need, as Tom Berenger's character in Platoon so nobly opined, \\"Every swinging d!ck out in the field.\\"<br /><br />What follows when the machines punch through the domed ceiling of the city is my favorite part of the film. It's mindless action here, folks, as the CGI effects fly fast and furious. The defenders in the city climb into these giant robotic machines armed to the teeth with massive machine guns and await the attack. Zion doesn't wait long. Giant drills punch humongous holes in the ceiling, followed by trillions of those familiar probes from the first film. Every citizen lends a hand, especially the women. They run around in the pipes and ductwork armed with homemade rocket launchers picking off the sentinels. Meanwhile, Morpheus and Niobe race back to Zion in their ship in a desperate attempt to save the faltering city. Neo and Trinity accept a more difficult mission: flying one of the ships to Machine City in order to strike a most unusual deal. To say anymore about this top secret and desperate mission would spoil the surprise for the two people in the world who haven't seen the film yet. I can say that it involves yet another battle between the Smith clones and Neo. This time around, however, the effects in the showdown look much better than the laughable burly fight in \\"Reloaded.\\" I cried at the film's conclusion--not because of anything that happened onscreen but because I realized Keanu Reeves would probably continue making movies.<br /><br />Seriously though, \\"Revolutions\\" was an all around better effort than the second installment. I was better able to weather the bouts of philosophical bunkum here than in \\"Reloaded.\\" Too, the incredible, over the top CGI war effects helped make up for the huge plot holes--almost. For example, I complained about how the second film removed any sense of danger surrounding the Agent Smith character. In the first film no one dared to stand up to the agents, yet everyone takes a crack at them in \\"Reloaded.\\" The same thing happens to the sentinels in \\"Revolutions.\\" Weren't they supposed to be these fearsome, nearly indestructible machines? Then how come mere bullets and homemade rockets can knock them out of the air? For that matter, if humans can build giant robots that move around and respond to the movements of the soldier sitting inside, couldn't they find a way to automatically load the guns instead of having kids tote boxes of ammo around on giant carts? Seems awfully inefficient to me. Anyway, you probably won't think about these conundrums as you watch the combat sequences; you'll be far too busy trying to take in all the amazing effects. I should have gone to see this one at the theater.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that the Matrix trilogy is a failure. The first movie will stand for years as a masterful epic, much the way Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" remains an epochal film, but \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" cannot keep up the pace.

I wonder if the Wachowskis will revisit this idea ten or twenty years down the road just as Lucas did?installment. I was better able to weather the bouts of philosophical bunkum here than in \\"Reloaded.\\" Too, the incredible, over the top CGI war effects helped make up for the huge plot holes--almost. For example, I complained about how the second film removed any sense of danger surrounding the Agent Smith character. In the first film no one dared to stand up to the agents, yet everyone takes a crack at them in \\"Reloaded.\\" The same thing happens to the sentinels in \\"Revolutions.\\" Weren't they supposed to be these fearsome, nearly indestructible machines? Then how come mere bullets and homemade rockets can knock them out of the air? For that matter, if humans can build giant robots that move around and respond to the movements of the soldier sitting inside, couldn't they find a way to automatically load the guns instead of having kids tote boxes of ammo around on giant carts? Seems awfully inefficient to me. Anyway, you probably won't think about these conundrums as you watch the combat sequences; you'll be far too busy trying to take in all the amazing effects. I should have gone to see this one at the theater. <br /> <br />All in all I have to say that the Matrix trilogy is a failure. The first movie will stand for years as a masterful epic, much the way Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" remains an epochal film, but \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" cannot keep up the pace.

B0006399FS|4.0|U2 can be classified the following way - Beatles, Led Zeppelin and U2. They belong to the category of the greatest bands of all time. I really can't see why a lot of reviewers are criticizing this album. After listening to it a few times it really grows on you. This may not be the best U2 CD, but it would be the best album of almost every other rock group if they recorded something like this. I gave it 4 stars in comparison to all the other fantastic U2 albums.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Echoes (2001.), a Pink Floyd best-of collection<br /><br />'Echoes' is just what the doctor ordered in terms of an overview of the band's long career. The first good point to make is to commend Capitol Records and those who have engineered the compilation for spreading the 'best of' over 2 CD's. Great bands like Pink Floyd more than often produce a large amount of high quality material (with the Floyd this is quite close to 100% of their stuff) and so when 'best of' compilations are confined to 1 CD the overview scope is not as good. Therefore with 2 CD's, there is a pretty good spread of material from the band's 14 studio album career, from 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' through to 'Division Bell'.<br /><br />If you are looking for some 'best of' Pink Floyd, this compilation supercedes previous Floyd compilations. 'Relics' is OK but it only covers the really early stuff (i.e. Syd Barratt stuff) and the other compilation, 'A Collection of Great Dance Songs' should be deleted from the catalogue as it is basically a 1 CD Floyd compilation with about 25% of what you get on 'Echoes' and also containing less scope of their work. 'Echoes' on the other hand is great for introducing someone to Pink Floyd. Aside from choosing their best stuff pretty well (a hard thing seen as they've done so much stuff), the tracks are placed in a good order and also run into each other very well, as to not make anything sound too out of place. It is a very good remastering/remixing/sound engineering effort. I believe and hope that 'Echoes' will be successful in converting many people into fans of this band and will encourage listeners to the compilation to then start buying Pink Floyd studio albums.<br /><br />So onto the overview of the material on the CD. Rather than trudge chronologically through the Floyd career, each CD contains a mixed share of both the earlier and later work. Naturally, 'Dark Side of the Moon' has the greatest representation on the compilation, with 'Time', 'Us And Them', 'Great Gig in the Sky' and 'Money' showing its brilliance clearly - although it is kind of disappointing that 'Brain Damage' didn't make it onto the CD. The early singles 'Arnold Layne' and 'See Emily Play' are here, as is 'Bike' from 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' for that taste of the Barratt years. Albums such as 'Saucerful of Secrets', 'The Wall', 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Meddle' get a good hearing on the compilation too, although I'm not too in favour of the cut down version of Echoes. This is in my opinion, Floyd's jewel in the crown and every moment of the original 23 minute classic has its brilliance - the cut to 17 mintes gives it a kind of sewn up effect which reduces its original class - I suppose time is the issue here though and beggars can't be choosers afterall!<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this compilation. I'm often sceptical about best of compilations for the top bands as you can be never confident that they will do the bands the justice they deserve. However, this one does and it is a fitting and ideal overview of the Pink Floyd legacy and makes a great introduction to the band.y' and 'Money' showing its brilliance clearly - although it is kind of disappointing that 'Brain Damage' didn't make it onto the CD.

B000022TSY|4.0|_Easy Rider_ is, of course, one of the most important pioneer independent films of the 1960s film movement.  It is the classic biker flick: two guys traveling across the Southwest United States searching for themselves and this country.  Thus, I have a hesitant recommendation.  Few other films that I have seen capture this time period with such accuracy, vision, and emotional power.  However, if you're not into \\"road trip\\" movies of the 1960s and 1970s, you might be bored by the film's spontaneous dialogue and long visual riding sequences set to great music.<br /><br />This film reminded me, in many ways, of the movie _Vanishing Point_, most likely because that film came out two years after _Easy Rider_.  Both depict a lost generation, endlessly searching for something that isn't there, only to be sacrificed for their journey.  The acting in this film is terrific and the meaninglessness of the film's ending is heartbreaking for those audience members who desperately seek to find the same thing that these two free spirits are searching for.<br /><br />I found the \\"Making of\\" featurette on this DVD edition to be very informative and really well done.  In fact, it is one of the better featurettes I have seen.  Hopper and Fonda (among others) take us behind the scenes into the magical making of this film and how it all just seemed to flow naturally, largely unscripted.  A word to the wise: you might want to check out the 35th anniversary edition.  While I have heard that the quality of the DVD is not improved, there is a soundtrack CD and a nice booklet for any true fan of the film.  Otherwise, you'll do just fine with this cheaper version.
B000002GYG|5.0|If you buy this, keep it in your car always.  Or whenever you are in your car at night, that's the bare minimum.  This is early Tom Waits.  Defining that would be smokey AM truckstops, cafes, bars with \\"Last Call\\" being yelled.  Nighthawks at the Diner is the residue people are reduced to on late evenings after a frightful workweek, deprived of all sensibility.  It's the humanity left in your system when you're close to empty.  It's the quiet 5AM street you walk down after you leave the last affair for the night.<br /><br />There are many Wait's ramblings and slow quiet tracks to put you in that late night mood, but you're already drunk, so you don't want something loud now, anyway.  This is the perfect mood piece for such a situation.  I find it's best listened to when I'm alone in these obscure hours.  Nighthawks never failed me yet.  Hell, I always keep it in my car.  Drive a lot at night, I suppose.<br /><br />Enjoy!  Frank's Wild Years and Small Change are also excellent late nighters.
B000001FMX|5.0|The New York Dolls debut album is the exact point where the Rolling Stones intersect with Punk Rock.<br /><br />In the early 70's, Mick and Company, like mad scientists, had perfected the distillation of Mississippi Delta blues crossed with sleazy urban rock and roll and burned themselves in the process, forcing them to retreat into the comparative safety of reggae and funk experimentation, soul balladry and less inspired rock.<br /><br />In the mid 70's, the Ramones, Sex Pistols and their ilk through off all pretense of artistry or respect for tradition and fully embraced the nothing to lose vibe of urban decay. They constructed a new sound shot through with angst where speed was prized over craft and irony ruled.<br /><br />With the 1973 release of their debut album, the New York Dolls tried to have it both ways. David Johansen, Johnny Thunders, Syl Sylvain, Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan have clearly processed the gutbucket style of rock and roll offered up by the Stones but cannot bring themselves to turn away from the blast they were having in the funky but chic and lowdown quarters of NYC. Madmen running around in garish drag and rocking out with abandon, they were embraced by the bohemian cognoscenti and reviled everywhere else.<br /><br />The experiment did not work out over the long haul but they made a glorious noise in their moment and left behind this 5-star testament to excess.<br /><br />All the songs are terrific but I especially love Pills.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This was a very good performance in which they sounded really good overall. The guys did great job. Dennis sounded awesome, if you can get past his air guitars and dancing:), Tommy fabulous too. When ya feel like Styx music, there's nothing better to throw in. No fan will be let down with this. I rate it second in my collection of 10 music DVDs behind ELO-ZOOM which towers off the charts at number one. I would not hesitate to purchase if you like classic rock and/or Styx.
0800177363|4.0|_Awakenings_ is one of the better movies that I have seen recently.  It is based on the real-life story (and book) of Oliver Sacks and his extraordinary work with \\"sleeping-sickness\\" patients in the 1960s.  In a preview to his work in _Patch Adams_, Robin Williams turns in an outstanding performance as a doctor who refuses to write off the consciousness and humanity of his patients in the neurology ward to which he has recently been appointed.  If that wasn't enough, Robert Deniro comes on the scene halfway through the film and delivers a stunning performance that yanks the rug out right out from underneath Williams.  His performance is very moving and never fails to get to me.<br /><br />While his Dr. Sayer's (Williams) techniques and experiments are, from a modern perspective, unethical and surprising, one never doubts his intentions and care for his patients.  The movie really churns up debate over the \\"personhood\\" of human beings that are in a vegetable state.  To whom do we grant consciousness?  How can we tell?  What are the limits of personality?  Dr. Sayer's tireless work with these patients and brief success truly challenge many of our assumptions about medical patients and their rights.  Fortunately, Hollywood did not screw this movie up and the film does not end in typical Pollyanna fashion.  If you like emotional films, inspirational stories, or the acting of Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro, you cannot go wrong with this film.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Ever wondered why mainstream Hollywood producers just don't get it?   Watch this movie. It's not about sport, or football, its about life and how we live it, and things that happen to us that shape who we are. A beautifully simple story. The joy is in the telling. Great young cast, great script, superb perfomances, amazing soundtrack, no contrived ending. Just a wonderful example of how American cinema can be truly great.  The tragedy is so many would rather watch \\"The Pacifier\\"
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's \\"North By Northwest\\" is simply one of the finest American films ever made. It is a great example of the skill and mastery that Hitchcock exhibited throughout his career. If you think back, there are few directors that have had as much success as Hitch did throughout his career.<br /><br />Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is involved in the Madison Avenue ad business. What does he do? It's unimportant, so we don't find out if he is President, an Ad Executive or in the mail room. He is quickly mistaken for George Kaplan, a man that some spies would like to have a word with. Forcibly transported to the estate of Lester Townsend, he is questioned by a man (James Mason). When Thornhill refuses to admit that he is Kaplan and tell them everything he knows, he is dispatched. He escapes and then sets out to figure out who George Kaplan is. Along the way, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful blond, and she becomes his ally. Thornhill's journey takes him from New York, to Chicago, to a desolate corn field, to an art auction, to Rapid City, South Dakota, to the face of Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Simplicity is the key to this film and its extraordinary success. The story is convoluted and may be considered improbable, but who is to say it wouldn't happen? I can't say that, especially as it is set during the Cold War and I have heard of many stranger things happening. The story is also very simplistic. We don't learn anything we don't need to know, and, frankly, it is most refreshing. I mentioned that we don't really learn what Thornhill does. He is involved in the Advertising industry, that much is clear, and it helps set up his lifestyle and his character quickly and plainly.<br /><br />As I watched the film again last night, another thing struck me. In many films today, the filmmaker treats the audience as though they have no attention span and little ability to think. They show us a key piece of evidence, show the character looking at it, show it going into a pocket, later show the character pulling it out of the pocket, looking at it again, getting someone else to look at it again, and then getting some feedback. Each of these acts produces a view of the item in question for the audience. There is a sequence in \\"North By Northwest\\" which I want to use to illustrate how Hitchcock did this very differently. Thornhill and his mother (the very funny Jessie Royce Landis, actually only a year older than Grant), visit Kaplan's hotel room at the Plaza. There, Thornhill spots a picture of a group of men which includes the man he thinks is Townsend (Mason), he points it out to his mother and the audience gets to see it. He puts it back on the desk and goes about his business. Later, as he is rushing out, he grabs the picture. Outside the hotel room, he slides it in his coat pocket. We don't see the picture again, but we know it is the same picture. Later at the United Nations, he pulls the picture out and shows it to someone else. Again, we know which picture it is, not because we have seen it again and again, but because Hitch has allowed us to see it once and we are intelligent enough to know what they are talking about.<br /><br />\\"North By Northwest\\" was made after \\"Vertigo\\" and before \\"Psycho\\". It makes perfect sense. \\"Vertigo\\" was reportedly a very personal film for Hitchcock. He put a lot of energy into the film was disconcerted when it did not receive the critical praise or box office that he felt it deserved. This is the first time that Hitchcock took the emphasis away from thrills and went for a more cerebral kind of suspense. He really delves into Scotty's obsessions and paranoia. It is a beautiful film and one of his best, but I can imagine that he was exhausted. It is pretty clear that Hitchcock was at the stage where he wanted to experiment a little. I can imagine that he probably felt that he should return to something that would help him get another hit. MGM purchased a book called \\"The Wreck of TheMary Deare\\". Hitch asked Ernest Lehman to adapt it for him. Lehman tried, but a few weeks later, he said he didn't know what to do with it. They talked a bit and then Hitchcock remarked that he always wanted to make a film with a chase across Mt. Rushmore. This single idea prompted Lehman to come up with, as he puts it, \\"The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films\\". \\"NbNW\\" certainly explores territory that the director traveled before, but he brings a mastery to the work that sets this film head and shoulders above the rest. It certainly helps that Lehman created some of the best dialogue ever written. More on that later. So, while \\"NbNW\\" doesn't exactly push the boundaries of obsession that he was trying to reach with \\"Vertigo\\" or the psycho-sexual babble he tried to explore in \\"Marnie\\", it does examine the relationship of Thornhill and Kendall. In fact, the entire film is about relationships. The relationship between Thornhill and his mother leads him further into the mystery. Her mocking seems to make him more determined to prove he was abducted, pushing him further into the mystery. Thornhill's relationship with Kendall is erotic, intense and takes many turns, some of which take the story in new directions. Kendall's relationship with Vandamm is threatened by her relationship with Thornhill, causing Vandamm to doubt her sincerity. Vandamm and his henchman, Leonard, have a relationship that causes more friction between Vandamm and Kendall. The relationships in the film are the most intricately plotted part of the production.<br /><br />Cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors. He accomplished in his career what people like Schwarzenneger and Stallone are trying to do today. No, I am not comparing the two action stars to Cary Grant, but they are trying to break out of the action molds that they have created for themselves and lengthen their careers by trying other genres. Grant had great success in many genres. Of course, he was a handsome leading man in many romantic films. He also had great success in screwball comedies (\\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\" and \\"Bringing Up Baby\\"), War films (both serious and comedic) and thrillers (primarily, films he made with Hitchcock, but also notably \\"Charade\\", one of his last films). He was versatile and enjoyed a long career. If Lehman set out to make `The Hitchcock Film To End All Hitchcock Films', Hitchcock almost robbed Grant of one of his more memorable roles. They originally considered Jimmy Stewart. Someone suggested Grant and Grant received The Cary Grant Role to End All Cary Grant Roles. Grant is known for his great looks, his sexy accent, his suave character. These all fit perfectly in the role of Roger Thornhill.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is one of the sexiest Hitchcock blondes, perhaps eclipsed only by Grace Kelly. Saint's portrayal of Eve Kendall pretty much defines what this type of character would be in hundreds of other films. She has to play both sides, never revealing too much to anyone, keeping her cool, trying not to fall in love. It is a difficult balance and Saint achieves it beautifully. She and Grant are so sexy together that it makes the films produced today look tame. In every one of their scenes, they are fully clothed, yet manage to create more sparks than any scene in which the actors are partially naked and simulating actual sex. In a couple of scenes, they spar verbally, flirting with each other. One of the sexiest kisses ever is captured in this film. They are kissing in Eve's train compartment and they move around each other, Thornhill's hands roaming all over Kendall.<br /><br />As much as Saint creates a character that defines the role, Mason creates a villain that is very scary without ever using physical force. His voice is so rich and full of character that pretty much anything he says can be viewed as threatening and menacing. He seems the perfect characterization of a spy about to sell government secrets.<br /><br />Martin Landau, in one of his first film roles, creates the role of Leonard, Vandamm's sidekick. Leonard is very devoted to his employer and dislikes Eve Kendall. There are slight homosexual overtones to the character which fit beautifully and help to further complicate the relationships in the film.<br /><br />Hitchcock is a masterful director, but in the case of \\"NbNW\\", he had three very notable contributors. Ernest Lehman created a screenplay that is masterful in its simplicity. He created a story that is suspenseful, memorable and efficient. It moves from one point to the next, never boring us with details that we don't need to know. The dialogue in the film is perhaps the most memorable. Everything is slightly veiled. When Kendall and Thornhill are talking in the dining car, everything they say will eventually lead to their romantic evening. The dialogue is rich and entertaining. More importantly it is not cloying and sentimental. The dialogue also becomes threatening at the drop of a pin, as voice by Vandamm and Leonard.<br /><br />Frequent Hitchcock contributor Bernard Hermann created one of his most rousing scores for \\"North By Northwest\\". What struck me when watching the film again is that there are very long passages with no music. You don't hear that in films produced today. John Williams and Ennio Morricone seem determined to prove their worth, overlaying every frame of film with music that is sure to evoke an emotion. In \\"NbNW\\", Hermann uses his music to accentuate the suspense or romance, not to substitute it.<br /><br />The other contributor that deserves mention is Bob Boyle, the production designer. He and his team recreated Mount Rushmore in a studio and did a very good job. Just a few brief moments of the chase reveal that it is shot on a sound stage, remarkable really when you consider that none of it was actually shot on the monument.<br /><br />The documentary included with the film is a treat in some ways and disappointing in others. It is great to see Eva Marie Saint again, very beautiful, narrating the documentary. It takes us step by step through the film and the sequence in which it was made. Some great production photos are used to illustrate. I found it disappointing that the documentary made various statements, but then provided no examples. For instance, at one point someone says that they felt tension between Hitch and Grant. Why?<br /><br />\\"North By Northwest\\" is my favorite Hitchcock film and certainly my favorite film.

In this book you follow him on his journey of revenge and bloody justice. This isn't a comic book, it is a rated R movie on printed pages. Guns, blood, nudity, and violence is its theme but yet if you look at it deep enough its also one of the most messed up love stories EVER! One you start reading the story you can't stop. I've read this story back to back in one sitting for the both. If you want a comic book with a great plot, rich characters and a hard goodbye then pick this up! Bloody good I tell you!
B0002858YS|4.0|I've been very happy lately that bands like Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol (my favorite band of all time), Modest Mouse, and The Killers have been getting popular. Sure, they're not the most original, but hey, at least it's not retarded little teeny-boppers such as Jojo and Ashlee Simpson. So, there's one reason I got this album. I fell in love with both the singles (\\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\") so I decided to get the album. Also, how much fun is it to say \\"I got hot fuss today!\\" I like this CD, but I think they go a little overboard with the synth. After the 5th song, you're almost begging them to just do one song without any synth, but no, they keep at it. Hot Fuss is pretty good and I would have it in my list of my top 10 favorite albums at the moment. But, in a couple months, I'm sure I will have forgotten about it. Go ahead and get it if you can find it for under ten bucks and you can't go another day without having Mr. Brightside (the best song on the album, sadly). By the way, isn't Brandon Flowers gorgeous?!
B0002VK66U|3.0|I'm sure most of you know or heard some Rainbow songs.With this album you pretty much get the same deal except that the songs are a bit more mellow than that of the Rainbow lineup with Turner from 1981-1984.If you like good melodic hard rock than this is what you need.Most people who like the 80's will love this. <br />1.Losing You(8/10)Good opener.Sounds like a cut from Rainbow's Bent out of Shape album! <br />2.Young Hearts(7/10)Good track with the usual chorus line that screams the 80's sound! <br />3.Endlessly(10/10)One of the best ballads ever! This song is really great.This is how a love song is done the right way.The guitar sounds really good on this track. <br />4.Rescue You(5/10)I didn't like this one too much. A bit too much pop and not enough guitar. <br />5.Feel the Fire(6/10)Not bad.A bit too weak sounding I thought. <br />6.Get Tough(6/10)the guitars sound better on this track. <br />7.Eyes of Love(8/10)This song sounds great.Another 80's classic. <br />8.On the Run(10/10)Sounds like a cut from a Rainbow album once again.I enjoyed this one.Fans of Rainbow will love this one! <br />9.Soul Searcher(8/10)Good tune this one is. <br />10.The Race is On(8/10)A good rocker this one is. <br />Overall I say if your just starting out to buy some good 80's albums, then this is a good start. I also Recommend buying Rainbow Bent out of Shape 1983, Straight between the Eyes 1982, and Difficult to Cure 1981.Thee are all so much better than Turner's solo work. <br />Long Live the 80's!

B000007T1M|5.0|Before System of a Down got repetitive radio play with Toxicity in 2001, they released this masterpiece. \\"Sugar\\" is a f**ked up song, but in a good way. They get really experimental with their music. \\"Spiders\\", the second single, is mellower, but still a good song nevertheless. This is a good album. You should buy it.
B000002L9J|5.0|Just the other day, a horrible feeling came over me. A feeling much like when you forget that you have something cooking on the stove. And you turn around, only to see two foot flames coming from what used to be a good pan. I was listening to 'The Queen Is Dead' by THE SMITHS!!! Not only that. But I thought it was GREAT! OUCH!!! THE PAIN!! Oh, well.
0312263120|1.0|First, I kinda liked Angels & Demons.  I read it outside of Florence, before visiting Rome and Vatican City.  It bothered me that the author didn't seem to know how radio worked, and was ignorant of radiation in general, and had no concept of EMP following an antimatter explosion--but I figured it just wasn't his field, so I let it all go and had fun. <br /> <br />But this one is just junk.  Sadly for me, I've worked for years in software development, and cryptography has been an element of that.  This Dan Brown guy posits a wonderful, unbreakable cipher that makes no sense at all.  After trying to analyze his description, it's either something so simple I could achieve the same thing in 30 minutes--or it's self-contradictory.  Still, I let that go. <br /> <br />Then he has a programmer at the NSA sending an attachment to email that will automatically send a response when the reader gets it, thus identifying...well...not very much.  But which plat form will this attachment run on?  Windows?  Linux?  Which email program is it designed to exploit?  And it gets worse.  A coworker \\"cancels\\" the program.  How?  The email has been sent already.  And there's a \\"return code\\" when he does it...um...this is like something written by somebody who hung around with a 1970's computer programmer but never quite understood what he was hearing. <br /> <br />So the book hit the wall.  It was too much.  Worse, I now question everything I thought I \\"learned\\" in Angels & Demons.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This Australian gem is one of those rare films that entertains, thrills and pokes fun at an established activiity (in this case, a ballroom dance federation).<br /><br />To take this film seriously is to miss out on one of the great moviegoing/ moviewatching experiences of the 1990s.<br /><br />In a nutshell, an up-and-coming champion ballroom dancer gets bored dancing the same tired steps that everyone has danced in competition the past 50 years and wants to break out and do things his way.  Of course, his way is the better way, but that causes all the angst, high drama, dashed hopes and utter hilarity that ensues as forces clash to prevent the young man from taking the ballroom dancing world by storm and up to a new level.<br /><br />Of course, it's what we've all, always, expected:  Things don't change in such events because those who judge and teach can only judge/teach that with which they are familiar.<br /><br />The cast is perfect, from the dashing young lead embodied by Australian ballet principal Paul Mercurio to the shy, at-first clumsy female lead played by Tara Morice (who also lends her vocals to Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Time After Time&quot; in a stunning rooftop pas de deux as she starts learning how to dance with him).<br /><br />Paul's mother -- beautifully and hysterically portrayed by Pat Thomson -- and his seemingly introverted, odd father -- a wonderfully giddy Barry Otto -- are perfectly realized, as are all the other roles, including Bill Hunter's terrifically change-resistant Barry Fife, president of the dance federation.<br /><br />This is probably Baz Luhrmann's most mainstream movie, since it's more firmly grounded in the now than anything else he's done.<br /><br />Be on the lookout for a stunning cinematic moment during an outdoor sequence at the girl's house with the lead learning from her father how to correctly dance the Paso Dobles.  When it's clear he's gotten the hang of it, the camera does a closeup on him turning and then cuts to anoncoming train, that parallels the house, sweeping down the lower right of the screen.  It's one of those Luhrmann touches that set him apart from most other working directors.<br /><br />&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; is a wonderful entertainment that flows along so quickly..and has dramatic highs...and even more thrilling dancing highs...that most of you will be very sorry when it's over.<br /><br />But never fear...it holds up very well on repeat viewings.  It's one of my most-played videos.
0316096199|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. It is a page-turner, how something so bad can happen and you can more forward. Life is hard and most keep things bottled up. I think that it is wonderful that she could share this part of her life. I read her other book The Lovely Bones and it is also a great book. She is now one of my favorite writers and I would read any of her work. I think that her style of writing is open and free very relaxing. I think if you enjoy page-turners then you would enjoy Alice Seybold's work. <br />I don't really like to read, but I enjoyed every minute of reading her books. <br />
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I HAVE BEEN A JUDAS PRIEST FAN FROM THE BEGINNING. THIS IS, FROM START TO FINISH. OLD LIKE NEW. THE RE-BIRTH OF THE BEAST THAT IS THE PRIEST RIGHT HERE THIS YEAR!!!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I don't understand all the hipe about Sarah and Michael.  I've seen the stage play twice (and hope to see it again) and neither time was Sarah or Michael in it and both experiences were fantastic. <br /> <br />I was expecting to be disappointed having seen the play, but I was very pleasently surprised.  I'm not familiar with the book so I had no expectations regarding the story.  The beauty of this movie is that you don't have to have seen the play or know the book.  It speaks for itself, giving you more to the story than the play while still retaining the atmospheric beauty and music of the play.   <br /> <br />Approach this with an open mind and I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B0000UJL96|4.0|thisa  movie was the point where the series finally got dramatic tension injected right back in it, thats been missing since The Wrath of Kahn (although 4 was great it didnt have Trek signtaure tension). The movie is the probablly one the more engaging entries of the series. With a strong plot and series usual great charchters. This is still one of my favorite Star Trek films.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|It really makes me sad that this movie did not get the recognition it deserves.I think the reason could be because Spider-Man and the Hulk were released around that time,and they are more mainstream.Daredevil was better than the first Spider-Man and WAY better than the Hulk(THAT MOVIE SUCKED!!!!).The theatrical version was really good,but I highly suggest that you buy the directors cut instead.The directors version really brings the characters out more and gives you a better idea of who Daredevil is and why he does what he does.Before I saw this movie,I knew almost nothing about Daredevil.I wasn't a fan but, thanks to this movie,I am now!!!!!
B000083C49|4.0|well rtest assured this the least action oriented chapter in the series since uh the first one, but like the older star wars films it still has a good charachters. The plot seems a little too much like a overblown series episode but The nice brisk direction from Leonard Nemoy makes the film enjoyable and probablly the most light hearted of the series. Hardcore fans will probablly grope but I got into Star Trek mainly because of the chrachters not so much the horrible special effects and sometimes the nice twists thrown in each film got me into them. It still is a nice change of pace of the melodrama serounding 2 and 3 (although those are both pretty good films,especially kahn.
B0007P3582|2.0|Two years after the huge success of his major label debut, 50 Cent releases his new album. The production is great, but all of the songs sound very similar. The lyrical content is not the best ever either. The album mainly focuses on the things that \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" focused on: shootings, rap rivalries, and getting a woman to shake that almighty ass. I understand that the level of quality in not only the new rap music, but in all music in general is at an all time low, so I wasn't expecting this album to be very ground breaking. Given that fact, this album is definitely not one of the best ever made, but it is way better than most of the garbage heard on pop and rap radio lately. Hopefully rap music will climb out of its dark hole and become diverse and creative again someday soon. Until then, go listen to some Public Enemy, Run DMC, Tupac, Beastie Boys, or any classic rap if you want to be exposed to quality rap music.
B00000ILBK|2.0|probablly one of the worst of the Star Trek film series thanks to a thin plot and flimsy direction. But the chrachters manage to keep it alfloat slightly, but like said before Im not crazy about the Next Generation cast.The film seesm standard Trek and jsut feels like a along episode. ITs watchable but hardly noteable
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple Plan returns again to damage the ears of everyone who hears their 'music'. Their first single \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is the most feminine song that I have ever heard. While 'singing' the lead vocalists voice sounds like a woman, young boy who hasn't reached puberty, or someone who has clogged nostrils belting out annoying songs about how the world is so harsh to middle class white teenagers. \\"Shut Up\\" is another horrible song off of this album, which my friend just had to listen to in my car one day. Afterwards, I promised my car that I would never allow sewage like that to be played through its speakers ever again. What happened to the good rock music? Remember Def Leppard, Metallica, and Van Halen? They have sadly been replaced by pop punk and emo garbage, as well as idiotic death metal. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disgrace to rock music.
B00078XGRO|4.0|Ill be honest with you like the Kirk-and-crew cast better the generations. the chrachters were more amusing and memorable the new crew has always been a bit stale. Contact seems to be the franchises most action oriented chapter yet. Here there against the borg. The movies action is actualy pretty nice, and the special effects are considerably revamped. But the plot is solid enough but not the most engaging. But if anything though ill give the movie credit for being the most intense of the batch since The Undiscovered country. So for all itd faults it still a solid sci-fi adevnture.
B0007OASII|5.0|First of all I feel the need to point out an obvious and striking difference between this album and previous releases.  'The Black Halo' is much heavier than anything Kamelot has done in the past period!  I am sure everyone who has heard the album has noticed this, but I have not read many reviews that have pointed out this glaring difference.  This is still unmistakenly Kamelot with all of the melody intact, but with much more power and crunch in the guitars.  In my humble opinion this is a very good thing because on Epica I felt Kamelot was sounding a bit to light for a metal band.  The production is really good and bottom end heavy yet still crystal clear.  It reminds me a lot of the 'Fourth Legecy' sound only more well balanced and up to date. <br /> <br />On to the songs, this album smartly opens up with no intro this time.  'March of Mephisto' is a mid tempo song with a soft verse which gives way to a crushingly heavy and middle eastern sounding chourus.  A great dynamic and building song.  An album highlight and I feel one of Kamelot's best songs ever!  Could have been even better though with a ripping guitar solo instead of the just ok keyboard solo. <br /> <br />'When the Lights are Down' is a typical speedy Kamelot song with some really cool riffs and a great chourus.  Another one of my favorites on the album and a very strong start. <br /> <br />Other highlights include 'Momento Mori' as well as the title track 'Black Halo', though almost every track on this album is great!  In fact the only tracks that seem to be a bit under par IMO are 'Soul Society' and the ballad 'Abandoned'.  Other than that this album is pretty much a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Some little things I felt could have been better.... <br />1.  More emphasis on the guitar solos!  These might be the weakest set of guitar solos of any Kamelot album. <br />2.  Khan's vocals sometimes get burried in the mix, could have easily been nudged up a bit. <br /> <br />Overall though this album is a masterpiece and probably my favorite Kamelot album to date!  Will be very high on my tops list of 2005!!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|this is one of the most beautiful love stories ever made into a film... <br /> <br />everything about it is charming. <br /> <br />i never thought i would care for a love movie of any sort beacuse Hollywood has a way of making carbon copies of the same love movies ever since Casablanca... <br /> <br />but leave it up to the French to make something that's so beautiful and so original. Actually the French tend to make very melancholy movies that end very sadly <br /> <br />but with the touch of enigmatic Lou Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) came one of the most beautiful love story ever made... <br /> <br />everything about this film is so well manicured... it seems that every detail from the sets, the music, the costumes to a very sweet story is highly paid attention to. <br /> <br />the sets were wonderful... everywhere you looked on the screen seem to glow or shine with brilliance... Jeunet seems to be telling you to slow down and look how beautiful life is! the cinematography is always full. what Jean does for this small town in France reminds me what Woody Allen did for Manhattan... he makes you fall in love with it. <br /> <br />and if anyone came away from this film not loving Audrey Tatou they did not watch this film... having seen other films with Audry i realized that she's just playing a character (contrasted from her brooding Senay in Dirty Pretty Things) but i think most people would like to always see her in this role... she pulls off the right amount of innocent and beauty that Amlie demands... <br /> <br />i could only pray that someone like Amlie would be meddling with my life... <br /> <br />the subtle touches with the special effects were not overwhelming but very fitting (the talking paintings and pictures... the melting into water and some the amazing shot of Amlie skipping stone) <br /> <br />everything about this film seemed to fit toghther... i recommend to anyone who is feeling downhearted and needs a little faith in the human spirit!
B0000028M7|5.0|For me personally, this album came into my world at the exact right time, when I really needed a band to relate to, it was in 2003, being 16, and starting to think more deeply about this world, and starting to understand music better. This is an insanely contageous and superenjoyable album. There are no bad tracks on \\"Dirt\\", the \\"interlude\\" or whatever (...I am Iron Gland..)is just unuseful and weird, but it proves that AIC took inspiration from Black Sabbath (...I am Iron Man!), the 2nd thing really close to Sabbath is the title track \\"Dirt\\" and its lead guitar riff, the slow and hard mystique riff is almost identical with Sabbath's \\"Electric Funeral\\", but f*ck it, no worries, just saying that Alice In Chains was 1990's Black Sabbath! for those of you who haven't realised it yet... <br />Well to the the songs, the big theme of the album is heroin, what the song 'Junkhead', says itself! and all the other songs you can't say for sure, but very, very much likely are those who atleast singer Layne Staley wrote \\"Hate To Feel\\" & \\"Angry Chair\\", but the rest of the songs also talk about atleast being in some deep trouble and how to cope with it...but as Staley once said about AIC lyrics, was that it's how YOU feel they relate to your life, than that's the meaning of it! for example, \\"into the flood again, same old trip it was back then, so I made a big mistake...\\" could talk about drugs, yes, but if you're a clean guy, but have some sort of other problem you get into over and over again, then that's how you get a meaning for the song. This album isn't that wide in range, but it doesn't have to be. Most songs are dark and hard, but they all sound so different anyway. \\"Them Bones\\" kicks off the album, a fast headbanger song, just insanely good chorus and melody, just a perfect undying song. \\"Dam That River\\", just an entertaining song, nothing that special though. \\"Rain When I Die\\", frustrating intro, but gets better, the chorus is sad but extremely powerful! good one indeed.\\"Sickman\\", it took some time to like this one, it's a bit \\"out of control\\" but it works, it's a sick song. \\"Rooster\\", perhaps this album's \\"Man In The Box\\", cause of it's insanely powerful and catchy guitar and singing, good lyrics too, no doubt. This one talks about the Vietnam war, and lead guitarist Jerry Cantrell's dad, who was in the war. \\"Junkhead\\", well, what it says, probably about Layne's past (during Dirt, I assume he was clean?) but about the excitement of starting to use heroin, I guess, it doesn't really talk negatively about it, he's probably saying \\"mind your own business!\\" you know, if he does drugs, it's his business, but it's ironic, in a way that Layne didn't keep one bit quiet about his use, but well, atleast he's honest. \\"Dirt\\", slow but great, has that good old mystique and darkness, danger and sickness (in Layne's voice), and some really dreepy lyrics like \\"...I want you to kill me, and dig me under..\\" \\"God Smack\\" one of the weaker songs, it's probably political, god smack (religion being an obsession and drug for some people), and yes, Godsmack took their name from this song!! It's a kind of groovy song, actually, but just slightly boring, but it's a little different from the others, slightly lightyer. \\"Hate To Feel\\", again a little slow song, little laid-back, but lyrically really rich, and a creepy but catchy chorus, just plain good. \\"Angry Chair\\", another classic! a very creepy and mystique song, but oh, so great! \\"Down In a Hole\\", a very beautiful but sad ballad,  a loveable song. \\"Would?\\", a masterpiece which sums up the album, has all the best ingredients of AIC, dark riff, catchy melody and singing, good lyrics and an magical atmosphere, JUST REALLY F*CKING NEAT! One of the true masterpiece albums of the 90's, undeniable talent and quality. This is the good stuff! An album and a band NO ONE should miss! It's sad to see many of these days bands copy AIC, and more annoying having friends loving them, and not paying attention to AIC, that just breaks one heart..but for everyone who really understand about depth, heart, soul and talent in rock, this is one of those bands, you can't deny!   <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|The global warming phenomenon, as explained by scientists, has already resulted in changes to the Earth's climate, and these effects will likely continue over the next 100 or so years.  In many ways, our goose is already cooked, due to the high levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases already released into the atmosphere during the past century.  We're making some progress now, but how much of a difference it will make is open to question.  Relative to energy output, emissions have already been scaled back, and more dramatic changes in transportation, power generation and even the components of buildings are taking place designed to reduce emissions further.  Against this progress is the fact of rapid industrialization and growing Third World development (and thus growing demand for the kinds of things we in the U.S. take for granted, like personal automobiles and larger refrigerators), particularly in two of the world's biggest nations, China and India--countries that were inexplicably left out of the Kyoto accords, rendering them meaningless. The other problem for environmentalists about the global warming issue is that the only practical way to accomplish Kyoto globally--or to go farther--is via the wider application of nuclear power, which is emission-free.  At which point, some of us say, hmmm, maybe milder winters in Canada might not be so bad.<br /><br />Unless Dick Cheney has been secretly alive for 120 years, and exerting unseen powers from his undisclosed location, however, he is not the villain of global warming. He is merely one of thousands of stooges for the energy industry since the first crude was pumped from Pennsylvania soil.<br /><br />\\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" however, casts a Cheney-like figure in the role of villain, responsible for the deaths of perhaps tens of millions of people during a bad few days during which the majority of the Northern Hemisphere gets frozen stiff, all because Cheney is too close to the energy industry.  What is worse is the embarrassing science depicted here. The film wants to raise consciousness about global warming, and instead discredits the theory by turning it into a premise not unlike a 50s science fiction flick.<br /><br />The acting of Dennis Quaid, as the bold scientist who repeatedly insults Dick Cheney and is thus ignored, Sela Ward as his saintly wife, and Jake Gyllenhall as his shy genius son, is all terrible, but it's probably not their fault given the sappy dialogue they have to utter. The emotional payoff of this movie is that Jake's character gets a girl to like him, although both remain virgins throughout.<br /><br />Why does this idiotic movie deserve three stars?  As everyone else has said, the CG special effects are satisfyingly vivid and destructive. The scenes of powerful tornados destroying Los Angeles, the rising waters swamping Manhattan, the mango-sized hail in Tokyo, and the flashfreezing of almost everyplace in the northern hemisphere--yeah! Even better than the aliens blowing up the White House in \\"Independence Day.\\" That's what this movie's all about.  I hope it leads to a new era of ultra-CG apocalyptic sci-fi, the dumber the better!  But, directors, please leave important issues like global warming out of it.industry.

B0006IIPJ4|3.0|Skycaptain has that comic book feel, which matches its all to comic book story.  Picture this: scientists are disappearing, giant robots pop up randomly across the globe, and Jude Law's character with his Flying Tiger style airplane is the worlds hope.  Now that's a comic book plot. <br /> <br />You know what?  I saw almost no advertising, except for one poster, thus I had actually a rather bad presumption of the film (although I try not to pre-judge.)  When it comes down to it though, the story was interesting enough to keep the viewer watching, but not nessecarily too deeply. <br /> <br />The largest fault in my mind was the style.  I mean could anyone really see what was going on because of how dark everything appeared to be?  Maybe that's because Skycaptain was the first film done entirely with green screen, or maybe that is not it.  On top of that issue, the story is just chock full of holes.  Not questions to be answered just spots of boredom.  On top of that, another Jude Law film, which for those who don't or won't remember 2004 should no it as the year we Jude'd too many. <br /> <br />  Summarily, those looking for Jolie will be suprised by her brevity on screen, and those looking for Jude will wonder why everything looks like a pit.  All in all, the movie was mere popcorn entertainment.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|As a big fan of Enya, Lorenna McKennitt and other celts, I was very dissappointed with this CD. These women's voice have no depth or character, they sound like 12 year-old boys. Doing covers without adding anything new or intersting is a waste of money. Especially the cheesy remake of Orinoco Flow. I was very let down.
6300181553|5.0|HOLIDAY INN captures Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire together and at their peaks, competing for the affections of one girl, Linda Mason (played by Marjorie Reynolds).  Jim Hardy (Crosby) has grown tired of performing in New York nightclubs and decides to open Holiday Inn, a resort for dinner and dancing that is open on holidays only.  Jim's friend and co-star Ted Hanover (Astaire), a regular ladies' man, pursues Linda to the inn after his own fiance and dancing partner, Lila (Virginia Dale), leaves him.  The movie's very first number, \\"I'll Capture Her Heart with My Singing (Dancing),\\" sums up the contrasting charms of Jim (the crooner) and Ted (the dancer).  Apart from this number (which is reprised at the end of the movie, after Jim has won Linda) and Ted and Lila's \\"You're Easy to Dance With,\\" Irving Berlin's tuneful score is holiday-themed and includes \\"Be Careful, It's My Heart\\" (for Valentine's Day), \\"Easter Parade,\\" and \\"I'm Singing a Song of Freedom\\" (for Independence Day).  \\"Abraham\\" (for Lincoln's Birthday) is a good song somewhat disconcertingly performed in \\"blackface\\" - clearly a custom of another era (HOLIDAY INN premiered in 1942, but even then the \\"blackface\\" number must have been going out of style).  But who could forget Crosby singing \\"White Christmas,\\" or listening to his own recorded voice singing a Thanksgiving song, \\"I've Got Plenty to Be Thankful For\\"?  Astaire dazzles in all of his dance numbers, especially the Fourth of July \\"firecracker\\" one and the stunningly costumed one for Washington's Birthday (which turns hilarious, thanks to Jim's machinations).  And HOLIDAY INN's \\"movie-within-a-movie\\" sequence is very clever, anticipating SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  Appealingly filmed in black and white, HOLIDAY INN is a wonderful musical from the movie musical's Golden Age, perfect for enjoying on any holiday of the year.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|With bassist Nick Oliveri and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl gone and ex-Screaming Trees' frontman Mark Lanegan barely in the periphery, the post-\\"Creem\\" team of choice musicians that created the popular Songs for the Deaf in 2002 is officially defunct.  In its stead, Homme has recruited a passable crew of replacements and somehow managed to grind out a modest batch of pulsating, sulfurous tunes ready for raw consumption.     While most of the songs are still anointed with the hard QotSA tang, the doctored band is at its best here when it takes measured dips into the orbit of distorted psychedelia.  \\"Burn the Witch,\\" a diabolical call-and-response between Homme's slithery falsetto and Lanegan's throaty growls accompanied by eerie high-pitch riffs, is easily one of the album's most solid tracks.  Similarly, the slurring vocals on \\"You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\" tilt and gyrate like an earthy monkey on crack before reducing to melodic breathing in the final minute.    The disappointing moments, not surprisingly, are found in the songs that try to evoke the quintessence of QotSA from days of yore.  \\"Tangled Up in Plaid\\" is less a tip of the hat to Dylan than to the band's past hit, \\"No One Knows.\\"  It's just as infectious but clearly lacks the touch once provided by the frenzied timbre of Oliveri's backings and the distinct smack of Grohl's drumming.  Still, there's no denying that Homme has made this album an impressive effort to slick up the band's makeover.
B00005JMJG|4.0|The first thing I must say is that the DVD doesn't have any significant extra stuff. I think I have should have the 2-disc set, but this is what I've got... <br /> <br />Talking about this film I must say I was very impressed. I'm not really sure that the whole plot has convinced me at all, but I think it is really innovative, close to Amenabar's \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and much better than Cruise's \\"Vanilla Sky\\". The way scenes are developed is also fascinating. <br /> <br />The science-fiction background is something you can be for or against. You can be conviced or not about the experience that is carried out with the \\"main character\\" mind to let it be spotless. During the first 3/4 hour you can see what is all about. <br /> <br />The romantic background is out of all doubt. The story of these two strange couple is lovely and their acting is very funny. Carrey can and must do the best of himself like in this movie and forget doing things like \\"Liar Liar\\" and \\"Ace Ventura\\". Winslet is at least the actress she could be in \\"Titanic\\" and now is showing the best of herself. Brilliant job. <br /> <br />But, why did I have to quit one star and not give five? The reason is, for me, very simple, the middle of the film is somewhat ridiculous. I have to refer to the scene in which the treatment is applied. The assistant doctor, his friend and his fiance having a party at the same time they try to erase the memory is something apart of the main line of the story. <br /> <br />Yes, the idea is memorable. A very good try. But it could even be better. Instead of one Oscar, perhaps two or three more could be earned with a simple effort.
B00005R62N|5.0|If that's an exaggeration, it's not a big one. This thing went on my iPod Shuffle as soon as I got it, and I can't stop listening. The sound quality is unbelievably good, and the song choices are practically a \\"best of\\" of their early work. If anything, I'd say that a lot of the songs sound even BETTER than their studio versions, especially Green Manalishi (where Halford delivers a hellishly haunting wail reminiscient of the original Peter Green version), and Victim of Changes (much faster and heavier). The four (!) additional live tracks are apperently from the same concert(?) and make an already spectacular live album that much better. <br />  <br />If only ever buy one Priest CD, make it this one. It's just that good.
0451529308|5.0|The loveable March sisters are easy to grow on you. For my recent (14th) birthday, my 16 year old brother gave me Little Women. I read it, and it took me a while, but it was totally worth it. Occasionally, I would have to re-read sections. But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!
B000286S8S|3.0|Van Halen reminds me of guns n roses... a great band that walked away and wasted it's talent for decades. The songs here seem so dated and old. The best work they ever released was FAIR WARINING and it is only represented by one track here. FAIR WARNING was the closest the boys ever got to being a band... the rest is just party music... like and 80's pop metal Beach Boys. David Lee Roth is the only thing that stood out... and nothing much has changed over they years. A good collection but it shows the limits of the band.
B00004HYLF|4.0|Back in the day, my friends and I (fusion freak teens all) used to consider this the ultimate jazz rock album, and probably still do.  It was completely mind blowing in it's time, but like most fusion music, it hasn't stood the test of time all that well. When you listen to this album today, some of it sounds very dated, just pointless riffing and speed runs punctuated by disjointed ensemble parts, with very little substance in the writing.  In particular, \\"Medieval Overture\\", \\"Majestic Dance\\" and \\"The Musician\\" suffer the most from this.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's some really great stuff here.  Lenny White's \\"The Sorceress\\" sounds amazingly fresh to me, probably because it is more flowing, has such nice funky grooves and less frenetic soloing.  To me, Lenny was by far the most underrated member of this supergroup, for his writing skills as well as his incredible drumming.  The acoustic title cut \\"Romantic Warrior\\" is absolutely beautiful.  The closer, \\"The Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant\\", pretty much stands as the pinnacle of the 70s jazz-rock movement, with amazing soloing and instrumental interplay.<br /><br />To me, fusion never got much better than this.  Of course, there's still Mahavishnu, Weather Report, Brand X, etc.!  But even more importantly, almost every one of these fusion albums has a \\"Tribute to John\\" or a \\"Miles Beyond\\" on it.  These fusion bands wore their influences on their sleeves, and as a result, jazz rock became the bridge for us rock'n'roll guys to explore the world of classic jazz.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac is a band filled with lineup changes from the very beginning. The longest-term affair in the band was was known as the 'Rumours lineup'.  <br /> <br />So before listening to this album, one has to note that this is not the 'Rumours lineup'. For the first time in almost thirty-four years, Christine McVie is not present. And that's a huge change. The notorious english keyboardist/singer/songwriter, with her charming compositions, was a key part of what made this band make a peaceful transition from hardcore blues, passing through different stages of rock and pop, to the straightforward and exteremely successful adult oriented rock act they were in the late 70's and through the 80's. Of course the sound that defined Fleetwood Mac during those years of success was also constructed by the talents of guitarist/singer/songwriter/producer Lindsey Buckingham and singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks, but it was really the mix of those three extremely different personalities which made classic albums such as Rumours or Tusk be that succesful. <br /> <br />So an album like Say You Will, which does not have that mix, cannot be reviewed with the same criterium that, say, Mirage would have. Even though this still IS Fleetwood Mac (any incarnation of the band with Mick Fleetwood on drums and John McVie on bass is Fleetwood Mac since they own the name - and this includes the much maligned Time lineup). This time the mix of the obscure and 'enchanted' Nicks songwriting, and the pop experiments of Buckingham is very attractive, but different to what we've heard before. <br /> <br />This was originally Buckingham's album, and you can note it, since his songs shine the most when it comes to review track by track. \\"Say Goodbye\\" is easily his best song in years, meticulously arranged by almost classical acoustic guitar parts and featuring poignant lyrics about lost love. \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" is almost the ultimate pop anthem, a very McVie-sounding track which by the way features McVie's collaboration on background vocals. Those would be his two highlights, having also other very good songs (\\"Miranda\\", \\"Peacekeeper\\", \\"Red Rover\\", another chance to enjoy Buckingham's masterful and vastly underrated guitar playing) and a pleasant commentary about the world's current situation (\\"What's The World Coming To\\") in his favour. The production varies from good to great in these tracks, but it just goes too over the top in \\"Come\\" (weird lead vocals) and most of all \\"Murrow\\" (an army of lead guitars in the end). You'd just wish to hear the real thing, which is something that only happens when you hear \\"Come\\" live, when the song just comes to real life. On this album it almost sounds out of place. <br /> <br />Stevie's tunes are carefully arranged to fit in here. Thus the electro-acoustic sound of Lindsey's guitar follow the songs as they develop with their magic lyrics. Some very fine lyrical work by Nicks is heard here (most notably \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" and \\"Destiny Rules\\"), and she rescues two of her most precious demos of the past with fairly different results (\\"Smile At You\\" is almost ruined by the bass-percussion-high lead vocal arrangement, and \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is favored by the melancholic piano and the moving lead vocal, making it one of the best songs on the album). But she also manages to deliver her worst Fleetwood Mac song to date (\\"Silver Girl\\", featuring memorable lines as \\"she was a girly girl\\"), and another song which had excellent intentions, but not really well done, in my opinion (\\"Illume 9-11\\"). <br /> <br />The title track is almost an attempt to have that Christine sound that the record misses. (And this does not mean that this is a bad album because McVie is not there). It is a very good collection of individual songs, with some low points here and there - which can always happen if you release an album with 18 songs in it, with attempts to create a more or less homogeneous sound which work in excellent ways at times.  <br /> <br />Perhaps this actually *sounds* as two separate solo albums (mostly because of the awful running order, which can anyway be changed by programming your stereo the way you want it to sound), only partially joined by the production. But the fact that most of these 'solo' songs are actually excellent, and that, at least from Buckingham's side, it's one of the very best collection of songs he's released in years (Stevie did have a great deliver with her 2001 album Trouble In Shangri-La), makes enough for a great listening time. The chemistry between those two, which began \\"when love started out in the darkness\\" creates a tension which can easily be felt in some of the more poignant tracks on the album. And the huge music voyeurs in us always like that.
B000060P79|1.0|Ever since a certain Berkley trio unleashed the petulant lyric &quot;listen to me whine&quot;, there's been no end of bands queuing up to unburden their litany of woes. Canuck five-piece Simple Plan are one such outfit, quick to illustrate that they too can moan about how life is so damn unfair, with a canon of songs so depressingly pedestrian you simply can't imagine just how difficult growing up must have been for them.<br />&quot;No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls&quot; is an abominable listening experience, crammed full of soulessly crafted gems as turgid as &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;. Even contributions from Blink 182's Mark Hoppus and Good Charlotte's Joel Madden fail to prevent this record from sounding as if it's scraped the last remnants from the pop-punk barrel.
0385474547|5.0|As so many others have noted, Things Fall Apart is a brillant book that deserves several readings.  I have used this text at the college level, and find that readers of all abilities get something from it.  Because of the rare English dialect of Achebe, lower level readers will need guidance, but they can still get through it.  At the higher levels, the subtle and brilliant symbolism and tragic irony that fills the pages will keep advanced readers pondering beyond whatever class time is devoted to the book.  Naturally, background schema concerning the life lived in West Africa is very helpful regardless of reading level, and so I have put my stills and videos from my travels to the region to great use in presenting this novel.  And yet, the basic human tragedy presented needs no additional preparation.  Achebe's character Okonkwo is not unlike many a Shakespearian figure--an action figure with tragic flaws in character.  These are timeless aspects of personal and interpersonal relations which are cause for discussion in any setting.  To add to this complexity of tribal and timeless character is the dual audience that Achebe addresses.  His satrical style regarding Christian and Animist dogma cuts both ways--attacking both European and West African sensibilities.  As a result, the message is manifold in its classic effect.

B000026FOA|5.0|This is hands-down, just a stirring and beautiful album. Distinctive guitar playing, the saddest voice you'll ever hear this side of the Red House Painters. This is one of the most haunting and elonquent albums you may ever hear.
1878574590|5.0|Fans of Miller know and appreciate the cutting edge details of these novels or novellas in comic book form. But here's the latest scoop: Sin City is now in movie form, a form strongly overseen by Miller himself (who was, understandably, suspicious and reluctant to let his work be potentially bastardized on film) He'd worked hard enough to get his own series and I doubt he liked the idea of putting it in other hands. Luckily, he had an integral part in the production and it shows.<br />  Still, you might well want to check out his books first because they'll prepare you for the strong noir atmospher of the film, the grittiness, the corruption various levels of society. In other words, you'll know what to expect, although the movie is still something other than the comic in tone and style, pleasurable in its own right. So biy the book and then hit the movie theatres.
B000002UAX|5.0|What can be said of the Fab Four that hundreds haven't said before? Without being too derivative, as I became old enough to truly appreciate them, this was my first true favorite. The strange thing being, this was the first Beatles album where they really weren't so much of a 'band' in the unified sense anymore. At any rate, this laid the groundwork for so much incredible solo work that would come from each of them after the breakup. Although my 'favorite' Beatle album constantly rotates depending on where I am in life, The \\"White\\" album is truly great.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.<br /><br />Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?<br /> Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.<br />  The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen. The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.<br /> If it sounds like I\\"m holding back on the plot details, I am..because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience. You won't be disappointed but this movie won't be for everyone. Check out the word of mouth first, especially from people whose opinions you trust. My group loves this one.<br /><br />One of the most creative and innovative movies of the year, so far.
0060977493|4.0|It's been a while since I read a book with this much subtle and effective wordplay. Richly written, Roy indulges in words and uses contrast in language to great effect. This  <br />aalong with the storyline structure (though at times confusing, it all comes together beautifully at the end) makes for a hyper-realistic, nuanced novel that is 'about' the medium of the written word just as much it is a story about the downfall of the family. As a character study, the book does not fail, though I found having to read between the lines a little bit more difficult toward the end of the novel, when the twins are grown. Overall, a book that requires thought, interest, and an appreciation of a story that takes time to develop.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|\\"Rush in Rio\\" in many ways breaks the pattern for Rush live albums-- it came after only one studio album rather than the usual four, and rather than being culled from several dates, its one show, and as aural evidence attests, a very special one.  The show is further augmented by a pair of recordings from earlier in the tour of songs not included in the Rio set. <br /> <br />Featuring a varied setlist (four from \\"Vapor Trails\\", three from \\"Power Windows\\" and \\"Permanent Waves\\", two from three different albums, and one each from eight records, this is an exciting, varied, and different setlist-- while it leans a bit heavy on the popular material, its certainly more varied than the setlist on \\"Different Stages- Live\\".  But there are quite a few rare gems in here as well-- we get \\"The Pass\\", \\"Bravado\\", \\"Natural Science\\" (although it was quite commonly played by now), \\"Red Sector A\\", \\"Resist\\".... but honestly, how many times DOES Rush have to play \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Limelight\\", \\"Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Working Man\\", etc.?   <br /> <br />The show is the usual top-notch performance from the band-- there's highlights all over, I was particularly happy with the entire second disc-- its great to hear some of the more modern material played-- \\"Red Sector A\\" was a particular highlight, what a great song.  The two bonus tracks tucked on-- \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\" (from \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\" respectively) are also superb-- these were actually highlights of the tour when it came through my area. <br /> <br />If you're looking to explore Rush, this is as good a place as any to start, if you're listening to the band, this may be a good live record to start with, its a nice show.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Upon the little change in her style (musically), many fans quoted, \\"Alicia finally leaves her piano behind.\\" From punky pop music to soulful r&b, many fans were happy for Alicia but some thought that the change of style might ruin her career, but guess what? It didn't! Even though Alicia add in some r&b beats in her new music, she didn't leave her piano behind, but twist the music together by adding r&b beats and a bit of more soothing r&b voice and her original piano notes makes this album the best of her, yet. All I have to say is I love her musical style and adapt to change up to date, but didn't leave all her past behind, because that's just a turnoff in music if people do those kind of transferation, like Mariah Carey did in the past, but Alicia just adds in more stuff in her music, and at the same time, keeps her old ones. Here's the rating for each song.<br /><br />1. Harlem's Nocturne- 5/5: It's an introduction to the album, but I was kinda disappointed because she won't makes this a song, because it would totally rock, with all those music and stuff.<br /><br />2. Karma- 5/5: As a violinst, I think that this song really rocks because Alicia adds in a lot of classical instrument, but in this song, the violin+piano sounds so modern.<br /><br />3. Heartburn- 4/5: Great song, this song has some similarity to her past songs from \\"Songs in A minor\\" album.<br /><br />4. If I Was Your Woman- 4/5: From the old song from some other dude, but Alicia sings it like her own!<br /><br />5. You Don't Know My Name- 5/5: It is a slow song from her but yet one of the best songs in this cd.<br /><br />6. If I Ain't Got You- 5/5: My favorite song of all time, well, ever since this album was release of course...The lyrics is so true.<br /><br />7. Diary- 4/5: One of the singles, but I didn't like it that much, but yet, the beats are cool.<br /><br />8. Dragon Days- 4.5/5: I like this song because of the definition of the song.<br /><br />9. Wake Up- 3/5: This song is more of a r&b song than others.<br /><br />10. So Simple- 4/5: It's a really fun song to listen to.<br /><br />11. When You Really Love Someone- 5/5: I don't know if she is going to make this song a single, but it should, it has something similar to \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" but not as good, but still good at the same time.<br /><br />12. Feeling U, Feeling Me- 4/5: A intrelude that is not as good as \\"Harlem's Nocturne\\" but cool r&b beats<br /><br />13. Slow Down -4.5/5: Just slow down...another r&b song<br /><br />14. Samsonite Man- 4.5/5: I like the title of this song, and after listening to it,  I know what it means and I think that is pretty thoughtful.<br /><br />15. Nobody Not Really- 4.5/5: A closing short song, like a interlude, it is pretty good.<br /><br />Gotta get this, I mean, afterall, Alicia got 5 grammys, so you know that she has it in her!le- 4/5: It's a really fun song to listen to. <br />11. When You Really Love Someone- 5/5: I don't know if she is going to make this song a single, but it should, it has something similar to \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" but not as good, but still good at the same time.  <br />12.

B0000026WD|5.0|When I first heard this CD when I was little, I loved all the songs on the album. \\"Black Or White\\" has been one of both mine and my mother's favortie songs. Even though this CD is my mom's, I still listen to it while I practice my hip-hop dances in either my room or living room. This is one of the best MJ CD's you will not stop listening to. If ya'll are Michael Jackson fans, be sure to find this CD in whatever music store you can find it in.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of the greatest adventure movies ever made. Everything works, first rate acting, great writing, excellent action, and just a whole bunch of fun. Errol Flynn shines in his best movie, he was born to play Robin Hood and no actor (I'm talking to you Kevin Costner) as even come close to his Robin Hood. Olivia de Havilland is also excellent as Robin's love intrest Maid Marion, her chemistry with Flynn is unmatched. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone both shine as the power hungry Prince John and the cold heart Guy of Gisborne. Also worth mentioning is some great work from a lot of the great character actors of the 1930's people like Alan Hale and Melville Cooper and Eugene Pallette. It's a great movie with some very memorable scenes (Flynn walking into the Castle with a deer slung over his back is classic). <br /> <br />Now for the DVD <br />The print is excellent, the picture is clear and clean and the colors all vibrant. <br />It's also jampacked with special features most notably a long and in-depth documentary on the making of the film that goes into every area of the production. Another nice feature is called \\"Warner Night at the Movies\\" this feature allows you to watch a cartoon, an old trailer, and new update (1938 news of course) this simulates the feel of watching the movie in an old theater back in the 1930's. It also has commentary by a film historian that you can play throughout the entire movie.  <br />There is another documentary on so-called Glorious Technicolor and there is also some thing called Robin Hood Through the Ages that is mostly footage from the old silent Douglas Faribanks Robin Hood.  <br />Also it has two short films one shot and narrated by Errol Flynn about a scientific expedition on his personal yacht, the other is an Archery showcase by Howard Hill (widely regarded as the best archer in the world at that time, he shot the arrows during the archery tournemant sequence and other sequences in the Adventures of Robin Hood.) Wait, there's more!? There are galleries in which you can view concept art, and posters and other kinds art from the Adventures of Robin Hood. There are even two Robin Hood based old cartoons one with Bugs Bunny and one with Daffy Duck. <br /> <br />All in all this one of the best DVD's I have ever bought definatly worth the low price. Great movie, great DVD, highly recommended
B00005JNQQ|1.0|I wouldn't have thought it possible for a computer-animated film to be described as \\"lazy,\\" given the amount of work required to pull off computer animation. Then I saw Robots. <br /> <br />Or should I say, then I saw one hour of Robots. <br /> <br />At the one hour mark, having checked my watch for the 4th or 5th time, I realized that it was not going to get any better. Robin Williams just wasn't going to deliver one inspired punchline. The plot was not going to take one remotely interesting twist. The fart and butt jokes were not going to stop substituting themselves for actual humor. It was going to suck out my will to live if I stayed and so I left. <br /> <br />I have to wonder how such a talented cast could be so incredibly misused. Wait-- Incredible-- Let's talk about the Incredibles. Another computer animated film and one that combined eye-popping animation with a compelling story sprinkled with fabulous action sequences, hysterical comedy and a surprising emotional depth. One of my favorite movies in recent history. <br /> <br />If anything, the brilliance of the Incredibles made me even more excited about seeing the movie Robots. And Robots, amazingly, managed to be the \\"bizarro-Incredibles\\" being absolutely the opposite of everything good about the Incredibles. Boring story, bland animation, almost no visual interest, not one laugh, zero emotional honesty. From Robin Williams on through the entire crew and cast it's hard to believe anyone cared about this film even as they were making it.  <br /> <br />Due to the talent involved, the time it must have taken to make and the sheer amount of money wasted in making and promoting it, I'd have to consider Robots the worst movie I've seen in years. Or, more accurately, the worst first hour of a movie. Walking out of a theater has never felt so good.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This CD is as perfect as they say. It shelters the love we feel. I really think this CD was perfectly designed. It is about truth, beauty, freedom and love.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|When WICKED opened on Broadway many of the reviews were mixed with several outright pans. The public vetoed the press and bought up all available tickets.  The $14 million managed to pay off in just 14 months and become a rare Broadway hit.<br /><br />Truth is WICKED is a good show. It's not perfect. It is uneven and the pacing is sometimes erractic. Much of the dark psychological subtext of the original novel is ignored. All of this doesn't stop the show from being an entertaining production and this orignal cast album is quite well produced.  There is enough dialogue to put the songs in context, and all the lyrics are included. But there is a serious drawback with the packaging: There is no synopsis. If you haven't seen the show you might have trouble following the plot.<br /><br />The performances are great: Idina Menzel as Elphab pours out her powerful voice in the sensational \\"Defying Gravity\\" and Kristen Chenoweth scores another in a series of musical theatre triumphs as the vain, slightly flighty Galinda. Carole Shelly, Joel Grey and Norbert Leo Butz all register strongly and the orchestra directed by Stephen Oremus offers a rich variety of textures.<br /><br />The opening notes of Stephen Schwartz's score are properly dark and ominous, but Schwartz  occasionally slips in a bland pop balld (the song \\"As Long as Your Mine\\" sounds like a left-over from AIDA) but at least he writes some great choral ensembles (\\"One Short day\\") and a ballad of emotional power for the two parting friends (\\"For Good\\") that will bring a lump to your throat.<br /><br />While there are better shows currently on Broadway there are also several much less rewarding than WICKED.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I just heard of Jack Johnson this week when I received \\"On And On\\" as a gift.What a fantastic CD, from beginning to end.The CD <br />reflects the amazing talent of Johnson as a singer, composer and guitarist. He can really write, sing and play. What I like most is the eclectic mix of pop, folk, jazzy fun groove that Johnson carves out with these slick, crafty little tunes. I use the word \\"little\\" only to imply they are too short. I wish each song was much longer. Nevertheless, the disc is so superb, I don't care. My favorite tracks are \\"Rodeo Clowns\\", Traffic In The Sky\\", <br />\\"Mediocre Bad Guys\\", \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\" and \\"Taylor\\". Johnson reminds me of Jon Mayer, Dave Matthews, Michael Franks and the overall product comes out in such a well done package. I can't wait to get his other discs. In the space of a few days, I just keep playing \\"ON AND ON\\". BUY IT!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I liked this movie, I am a big horror film buff. This wasnt TOO scary, but just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Full of mystery, and plenty of suspence. I recommend seeing it. (I would watch it more than once)

B00005ATQ9|4.0|As has been previously pointed out, the music, costumes, and in general, the art direction of this film are impeccable. The film is a joy to behold--and to be hypnotized by. Yet it is still lacking. I can understand when others say that Kubrick cared more about bringing 18th century life to screen even at the expense of developing character. Many interactions in the film are very subtle--for example, when the Countess Lyndon is at the card table, seeing Barry for the first time, her response to his interest is expressed through her eyes, through the light movement of her mouth. It is barely visible, but it is there. Or we can consider the character of Reverend Runt, who is played wonderfully--his character is expressed through his every movement, through the way he turns the pages of the prayer-book during the wedding scene, through the way he looks at people, through the way he holds his hands. The result is that most of the movie advances slowly, meanderingly, via minute detail and creates an overall mood for the entire picture. Consequently where the film really falls short is where Kubrick brings in more traditional action in order to advance the plot. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie. A few examples: first the battle scene near the beginning of the film. It felt entirely unnatural, especially considering that the English regiment was getting shot at, but kept advancing without firing. Barry's loss of his friend in the skirmish seemed too melodramatic; the event also is one of the few times when the actor O'Neal, expresses any emotion. In fact, O'Neal is in two states for most of the movie--expressionless, or crying. His lack of expression is usually not a detriment, but he just does not have the range that the rest of the actors have, he does not seem to pay as much attention to detail of subtle body movement as the rest of the cast. Also, the scenes when Barry is beating his step-son, or the scenes of Brian's death seem very overdone. I suppose wheremany people complain that this movie is too slow, I wish it were slower yet. <br /> <br />Simply put, don't watch this movie if you want to see action, because most of it consists of slow scenes intermittently broken up with a little bit of \\"fast action\\". If you do watch it, you'll have to watch it closely because the spoken dialogue is usually subordinated to subtle expression. This is a film more for hard-core Kubrick fans, than for general audiences.
B00030EIXW|5.0|You have not seen conducting greatness until you have seen this man!!!  Barenboim, Rilling, Szell, Thomas, Bernstein, Solti, Levine, Karajan, Rattle, and on and on....not one of these fine conductors are like the great Carlos Kleiber.  So passionate about the music and orchestra in front of him he once conducted through an earthquake!!!  I first saw this video in grad school in an aesthetics class. This is a must have for all serious musicians.  Kleiber doesn't bother to simply beat time through these pieces, he allows the music to explode out of the orchestra.  His 7th is enchanting and exciting.  Buy this. Watch this and carry this man's energy into the your music making.

0679721037|5.0|While many people may have thought that the nuclear bombs blasted over Hiroshima & Nagasaki were justified to end the war, this book would certainly give people a lot of room for thought.<br /><br />John Hersey gives us the story of six of the Hiroshima survivors (& their families & friends). This new edition also includes a chapter written 40 years after the bomb, following up o the lives & fates of the 6 survivors.<br /><br />While the book can be extremely graphic & detailed in describing the results of the bomb on many of the survivors, no one would b able to read it without being impressed with he disaster these people went through.
0385512058|5.0|I've read many networking and business books but none as good as Keith Ferrazzi's \\"Never Eat Alone\\".  In my view anyone, anywhere, in any type of business can apply the concepts that Mr. Ferrazzi describes in this book - relationship building. His personal experiences provided concrete examples of how he has successfully built and maintained relationships throughout the years.  Even though many of his readers will not be rubbing shoulders with the likes of President Bill Clinton, the concepts and suggestions are easily applied to the average business. What I especially liked about the book is that Mr. Ferrazzi provides explanations of why some ideas have worked better than others.  He describes both his successes and failures. After reading the first few chapters I found myself reaching for a pen and paper to jot the ideas presented so I could implement them into my own professional practice. Many authors just provide a list of what you should do but never explain why or how it works.  The personalized style and ancedotal stories refreshingly provide the answer.  An excellent, quick, must read for anyone already in business or starting a business.  A++
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|I love this album, you can't help but groove and swagger along to it as you listen to it. It really surprises me when I read about how worried people were that Nick was kicked out and that the band wouldn't be the same. The album was never gonna be like SFTD, without Grohl or Nick. However Josh has shown with his previous work (Kyuss, Desert Sessions) that he is an extra talented song writer who attracts other talented musicians. Some of the songs of SFTD had a similar feel to them (five star album all the same), but that can't be said for Lullabies, almost every song something original. The only reason I didn't give the album 5 stars is because I think an album gains that fifth star if it still excites you after a year of listening. There is definitely no filler on this album, if you dont get excited by a song I can asure you its most likely someonelse's favourite. A few reviews I have read on the album have said that Broken Box is unpleasent or distasteful, I disagree, its a song from a jilted lover. Bonus DVD is great as well, it shows how Josh and his crew's attitude and surroundings really soaked into their recordings. There are few things you can bank on, but one is that anything Josh Homme has a hand in, is worth listening too.
0142401668|5.0|What really impresses me with Stormbreaker is how Anthony Horowitz takes a teenager like Alex Rider, turns him into a James Bond-hero of sorts, and yet still makes it very believable. Alex is potrayed as a kid forced into a position he really doesn't want to be in, made to spy by MI6. It really sheds light on the world of espionage, really showing that it is not as glamorous as in the movies. There is no sex or anything like that, and Alex isn't the smooth talking manly-man (or whatever, you know what I mean) like James Bond. There is enough action in here to satisfy action fans' tastes, yet it keeps an entertaining, suspenseful, and really very human plot. Any youth reader should read this one. (Just be warned that the title Stormbreaker refers to a computer. Sorry, my friend complained it was a bit misleading and I thought I would bring that up. Very minor I would say, but still...)
B000002GQJ|3.0|The Moody Blues were a big part of my musical life back in the first half of the 1970s. I had several of their albums, and I saw them in concert a couple times. As I drifted more into jazz, the Moodies sank slowly into my listening past. Then, in the 1980s, I found a cassette set entitled This Is The Moody Blues and have regarded that ever since as an excellent overview of their first seven albums. And, after hearing a couple of their CDs from the period covered by that compilation, I remain of the opinion that it is one of the most aptly compiled \\"best of\\" albums I've heard. <br />Recently, my interest in progressive/symphonic rock music revived and I tried to find the aforementioned compilation here on amazon. As it seems to be either out of print or just plain unavailable, I instead settled on picking up on CD the Moody Blues early releases I did not already own on vinyl. A Question of Balance was the first as it contained some songs I remembered from back in the day. <br />Well, after listening several times, it came to me that most of the songs and the instrumentation sound quite dated. In the remastering, the tambourine is far too prominent. There are some excellent songs on AQoB, but its clear that the greatness of the Moody Blues lies not in the great quality of any particular album, but in the fact that they were able to mine the same musical vein for so long and come up with a remarkable number of great songs scattered amongst the dross spanning the period from Days of Future Past to Seventh Sojourn. <br />Question is without question the \\"hit\\" that powered this album. I like the song just fine despite that radio wore it out, but I think the best songs on this album are And the Tide Rushes In, which highlights a new sensitivity in male/female relationships, and the introspective masterpiece, Melancholy Man. I also enjoy Tortoise and the Hare as well as Its Up To You. <br />Though this is not a CD I will have in frequent rotation, its a great one to have atthe ready for a \\"Big Chill\\" type party for folks of a certain age. Give it 3 stars plus.
077106506X|5.0|You either love story collections or you hate them. So it goes with the writing of author Alice Munro. She has found her niche and sticks to it. She has themes and topics that are present in most of her books. You either like it or you dont.  I happen to think her writing is fantastic just the way it is. I would be distraught if I opened a Munro book and found her trying to be someone she is not. I know what I can count on her to produce, and thats why I love her story collections. She is a highly dependable and entertaining writer. RUNAWAY is written in the same style as Munros previous efforts and will be a welcome delight to those already familiar with such titles as HATESHIP, FRIENDSHIP, COURTSHIP, LOVESHIP, MARRIAGE and THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN.  There will also be strong appeal to those familiar with A COMPLICATED KINDNESS by Miriam Toews, THE CHILDRENS CORNER by Jackson Tippet McCrae, and MY FRACTURED LIFE by Rikki Lee Travotla.
B0002N4ZEW|5.0|This album is pure genius, there is not much more to say about it. Not only is the premise (To musically follow an acid trip) very intruiging but the music itself has gravity. It pulls you in and before you know it you can't turn it off. This is the mellow rock/ambient genre in it's perfect state. The songs are constructed in such a way that you as a listener can expirience everything the subject is. It makes it so the obscurities that an acid trip may bring on seem normal, just as they would if you were really on the drug. Anyway you look at it, this CD is great and if you enjoy porcupine tree, no-man or any other great ambient groups like godspeed you black emperor you MUST have this CD. It's definetly worth your money and time.
B000002LIM|5.0|I went and saw this movie when I was a kid and I loved it so much. I watched it at home so much on vhs that the sound didn't work but I knew everyline in the movie anyway so it didn't matter much, but the music wasn't there and it just wasn't the same. I bought the soundtrack and fell in love with Danny Elfman's music. It was the first soundtrack I ever bought and it is still my favorite one. Tim Burton and Danny Elafman make the best do o in the movie business. I would recomend anything by Danny Elfman. Any Batman music by him is great just not batman forever or Batman and Robin that was composed by a different composer and it's just not the same.
0679731369|5.0|This novel, Barnes's third, published in 1984 still stands as his most acclaimed book, despite a plethora of other writings since, and deservedly so. I once attended a talk given by Julian Barnes on this novel, and he was asked if he felt as if it were an albatross around his neck. He quoted Kingsley Amis, whose own reputation was founded largely on his first novel, Lucky Jim, who said with a sniff: 'better than having no albatross at all.' Indeed.<br /><br />Why is Flaubert's Parrot widely known to be Barnes's albatross? I feel it represents the best combination of his particular writing talents. Gustave Flaubert (his favourite author); an elderly English narrator who reflects wistfully on human identity, love and the past; Anglo-French cultural matters (see the excelleng Cross Channel chapter set on a ferry); and witty, sophisticated humour that is the hallmark of Barnes's best writing.<br /><br />The form is also totally original. After two early novels written in a fairly conventional narrative structure, Barnes ripped up the rule book and set this novel with two bookend chapters narrated by Geoffrey Braithwaite, an elderly doctor who motors around Rouen and Croissset trying to track down which of two parrots was the original that sat on Flaubert's desk when he wrote 'Un Coeur Simple'. Inside of these is a series of chapters that explores the life of Flaubert, each from a peculiar angle. For example there is a chapter containing three biographies of the man - one positive, one negative, one constructed from the accumulated quotes of Flaubert during his life: 'I'm so tired that I feel I'm liquefying like an old Camembert'. Such is the problem of tracking down the identity of this elusive writer. Another chapter focuses on the colour of Emma Bovary's eyes as depicted by Flaubert in Madame Bovary, another is a memoir from Louise Colet, Flaubert's mistress. In addition there is a collection of Flaubert's writings on railways, in another there is a quasi-spoof exam paper on Flaubert's work. Barnes stated at the talk that the aim of this was to try and construct a biography of the writer not by going at it conventionally, but by sinking mineshafts from various angles into the subject and seeing what light can be cast on the past.<br /><br />With typical English reserve, Geoffrey Braithwaite tells the story of Flaubert because he can't come to terms with his own personal tragedy - that of his wife's suicide. What results is a curious meditation on human identity, literature and the difficulty of capturing the past. It merits several rereadings to grasp the intricacies of the different sections, many of which contain wry asides and tantalising surprises.<br /><br />The spliced narrative model was followed by Barnes in his 5th novel, A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters, but with less success. Flaubert's Parrot is a rare example of a bold, genre changing writing experiment that comes off brilliantly.exam paper on Flaubert's work.

B00005OAIE|5.0|The editor of these reviews needs to be fired.  He is a loser, and evidently does not know good music because my boy is hot.  Amazon needs to hire some better people.  He sucks
0743454537|5.0|Picoult knows how to tell a great story and she does it again this time.  She explores the dynamics of a family in crisis, and tells it from differing viewpoints.  She makes the characters so real that you respect all of them and she deftly shows that in some cases there is a very fine line between right and wrong.  Or maybe there is no right or wrong.  Some people have criticized the ending but I thought it added more to the complexity of the situation.  This is a book that i recommend to people again and again.

B000069HK2|4.0|the songs are great all cool catchy when it came out it was different than the other bands that were really popular at the time (now there are a million copycat bands. Bert McCracken has a really great voice. he can really sing when you listen to some of thier slower songs ( own my own, blue and yellow) but overall the used are  a really good band
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|This is what you come to expect from QOTSA.  <BR>From the first listen, I really liked it.<BR>It's a perfect blend of fast and mellow.<BR>I think that the only thing that's missing when you listen to this record is that Dave Grohl isn't playing drums, and especially on &quot;Everyone Knows That You're Insane&quot; you would really want to hear him.  The song still rules in my book though.<br />As does the album.  If you liked Songs For The Deaf, I think you'll have no problem fitting this into your daily listening routine.<BR>Definitely a keeper.
B00025ETIW|5.0|i love love my chemical romance. im not okay(i promise) does this bad no justice. its a great song but its crap compared to the rest of thier album. the first time i put in the cd and listened to Helena i couldnt stop listening to it. thier songs are really great and i think they are a little different from the other 'scene' bands out there
B00020X88O|5.0|.... that should be the Amazon suggestion on purchasing this DVD with another. Just fantastic! I loved Showgirls, it has all the makings of a classic cult film, main stream flop, bad dialoge, campyness that is not ment to be, T & A, please..... what more so you want! Buy this with the movie GLITTER for a real treat!
B0002858YS|1.0|Someone had to cash in on dumbing down new wave for a new generation, and I guess it's these guys. Doesn't really matter, since in six months they'll be forgotten. If you want to be ahead of the curve, ditch this faux-indie schtick and start idolizing the  Pig Destroyer.
6304779356|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was when I was 9 and i fell in love with it. The actors played their parts very very well. Sam and Michael were great together and the Frogs brothers. The teenage vampires were great too. My favorite actor (YET CUTE and HOT) is Kiefer Sutherland he really is a great actor. I think that his voice and creepy laughter is the scariest thing about him. That is what makes him a great actor in my opinion. Joel Schumacher is a great director I have heard of besides Tim Burton.
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is GREAT! From the moment I got it (which I got the day it came out) I have not stopped listening to it. You can feel all his songs and the message behind them are real. He tells a story and you can feel him if you listen from start to finish. I wish JL the best and I know that he will go far. <br /> If you get a chance to catch him in concert he is AWESOME and knows how to rock the house.
B00005AWMF|5.0|what else can i say.i would give this cd 10 stars but it only let me give 5.this is the woman everyone is talking about.can't get any better than this.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have to admitt i was a bit skeptical when i saw that Phantom was being turned into a movie, but then i saw the previews. Them alone made me dig out all of my Phantom CDs and books.  <br /> <br />When i saw it for the first time, i was amazed. Not only had they captured the spirit that i had longed for since i saw it on B-Way, but they also added new light to it by adding scenes that they were not able to do on the stage.  <br /> <br />The casting was excellant. Emmy played a wonderful Christine, capturing her youth and innocence and of course, her beautiful voice. Gerard Butler played a great Phantom, his voice was encahnting and suductive. Truly a Phantom to remember.  <br /> <br />Overall it was a wonderful movie, that captured it all. One to own on DVD for sure. I am looking forward to it's release.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie was just amazing.  Just a wonderful story and just one that was wonderful and sad, and happy.  I can only wish that I would be blessed with a love such as these two characters had.  Why does love this passionate have to only be in the movies? The young Noah is just to wonderful for words.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I was so excited when I hear that \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" was being released as a movie.  I have never seen the stage production but have been listening to the music for years.  I found the movie to be very beautiful and beautifully made but I cringed every time there was a close up on the actors singing.  The dubbing was HORRIBLY innacurate.  It looked like a bad lip-sync.  I do not know whether or not the actors actually sang their own music or if it was done by other people.  The characters' faces were expressionless and dispassionate while they were singing, and they looked like they were uninvolved emotionally with what was happening to them.  They ought to have looked frightened, in love, or at least concerned with their situations.  I almost gave this movie 5 stars, but had to back down to 4 stars.  I'm definitely buying this the day it comes out on DVD, but may watch it with one eye closed.
6305971099|4.0|Starting with the movie, it's a great continuation from Halloween 4. Our favorite characters rejoin from the last film (at least the living ones) and Donlad Pleasence and Danielle Harris are brillant. As far as the dvd itself, the short documentary is great. It shows some old footage shot behined the scenes that's total eye candy for any Halloween fan. One particular feature of the dvd that I enjoy is the reverse side of the cover. As most of you know, you can pull out the covers from the dvd plastic shells. On the reverse side of this movie is a nice little review by Michael Felsher, adorned with behined the scenes shots of cast memebers being applied with stage blood. Very nice!
B000000WA4|5.0|...so let me tell you.\\"  I'm going to try to write a simple, objective review of this album, since I've seen so many subjective ones on here.   <br /> <br />Many people do not believe Billy Corgan's voice is pleasant.  If you can tolerate his voice, you can tolerate this album.  He took singing lessons very soon after this album was finished, therefore he sounds much more rich and in tune on Adore (1998) and Machina (2000).  This album is very bombastic, raw, and loud.  I feel that his voice adds to the raw aspect and complements it nicely.  This record sounds good if you are angry.  There are also a few songs thrown in between which are quiet and laid back.  I really appreciate this kind of variety.  The lyrics are frequently (over-)dramatic, whiney, and depressing; they portray lost love (lots of it), love in general, anger at love...you get the point.  The lyrics though, to me, are very objective and can be interpreted in many ways.  I also like this aspect of this album.  Michael Stipe of REM once said that 3/4 of his lyrics were sentences he overheard people saying on the street.  I think Corgan uses this method as well somewhat, as he works many different lines into a song to portray a common theme. <br /> <br />Other people who reviewed this one (mostly the 1-star ones) often suggest another band to listen to instead of SP.  The bottom line is that if you are a Pumpkins fan, this is it.  Their magnum opus, trump card, masterpiece.  This is the apex of the Smashing Pumpkins, as a group.  Sure, they went on to explore electronica on Adore and mixed the two styles of hard rock and electronic quite nicely on Machina, but I think Mellon Collie was what they were gunning for since they came together.  Although, during the Adore period, the Pumpkins were nominated for a Grammy for their contribution to the Batman Soundtrack, everything after Mellon Collie was not even close to being as successful (in record sales) as this album. <br /> <br />I could say, like others, that this album is objectively awesome.  But instead, I'll say that this is one of MY favorite albums of all time.  People who write reviews such as \\"You call this a concept album?  Dream Theater rocks!\\" piss me off.  Comparing DT to Pumpkins is apples to oranges.  It's very funny, though, how similar DT's concept albums are to this one:  a commentary, whining about love and death and everything in between.  'Oh Nicholas...' <br /> <br />If you are just getting into Pumpkins, I don't know where to tell you to start.  It doesn't really matter.  But I believe that this album is their best, and record sales would agree with me on that one. <br /> <br />Selah. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
6305546797|5.0|For anyone who bought this while it was released, they truly own a gem. It's one of a kind documentary is a treat enough for anybody, but the Hologram cover really puts this one in the treasure box. Sure you can still go out and buy the first version, but when you realize you own a version that's out of print, it makes it that much more special. I personally own the 2 disc set with the extened Television version. Most critics say the extended footage is horible, but I think it's a blast to watch, considering the 25th Anniversary edition doesn't even play those scenes seperately. They talk about it for a few seconds and show minor clips. Again, the restored limited edition is a great gem for the true Halloween fan's collection.
B000062YB1|5.0|While I could never pick a favorite Slayer album (that's like asking a parent to pick their favorite child) I would say that this stands as one of their best. Their song writing is top notch, representing the very best in 80's style thrash, blowing anything else out of the water in terms of aggression, darkness and intensity at the time. This is also their most accessible album and it is no surprise that three songs (War Ensemble, Dead Skin Mask and the title track) all went on to get radio play and videos. There are no bad songs on here and the overall atmosphere is one of Slayer reaching maturity, combining the best elements from their previous albums into a cohesive package. Truthfully, this disc is almost like the sampler platter at a resturant; you get a taste of everything you want, all of it done to perfection. Highly recommended for people who have never bought a Slayer album, but want to start. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: War Ensemble, Blood Red, Dead Skin Mask, Seasons in the Abyss.
0385474547|1.0|I found myself studying the elements of this novel and, after a somewhat promising setup in the first chapter (when one is driven to believe the plot is made of Okonkwo's conflict with someone in his village or with his own personality), I could see the scenes dissolving into nothingness and losing any dramatic grip it could've had at the beginning. Most of the novel sets Okonkwo's issues apart and is focused in how the rites, ceremonies, marriages and feasts of the Umuofia village are being prepared. Anyone looking great Fiction entertainment, great characters and memorable conflicts should be dissapointed. On the other hand, some Historians or Anthropologists might find it resourceful of the lives in Nigeria's thribes before Colonialism.
B00005OMTT|1.0|A lot of people like Enigma, and nothing wrong with that, I guess.  A lot of people also like Slim Jims.  No accounting for tastes.  But when I read some of these reviews, in which New-Agey \\"sensualists\\" gush on about how Enigma \\"changed the way we look at pop music\\" and so on, I feel compelled to write my own review in response.    I mean, come on people.  At its very best, Enigma is bland, insipid, uninspired elevator music.  If you're looking for something to take the abrasive edge off that Enya record, or you're having a discussion about freshness over flavored instant coffee with your mom and you need a soundtrack, or you just want an album that won't distract you from staring at your wallpaper for hours on end, welcome home.    There's nothing worse than when somebody who is really totally artless develops \\"artistic pretensions.\\"  In the case of Enigma, Michael Cretu exhausted his entire store of creativity with the (itself impossibly lame) hit \\"Sadeness Pt. 1,\\" and it's all been downhill from there.  Either he repeats the exact same formula, in which his mystic electronic schlock is at least marginally held together by repetitive white man's hip-hop beats, or he lifts some exotic miscellanea from a world music CD and backs it with Cirque de Soleil synthesizers, or he tries to actually produce \\"songs,\\" with, like, singers and lyrics and stuff, but the songs invariably suck, the singers invariably blow - especially when Cretu himself lays down the vocal, yikes - and the lyrics are so bad that it isn't even funny, it's practically vicariously humiliating.     By the way man, not many people know about this, but if you take the initials of the title, it's like he's talking about LSD dude!  Oh my god man, wicked.  This dude is like on drugs dude!  Sweet.    (P.S....OK. I wrote this review based on my memory of Enigma, and really, I wasn't too far off the mark. Having just re-listened to a few tracks at a friend's house, I am willing to amend that the \\"Sliver\\" mixof \\"Age of Loneliness\\" really isn't too horrible, even with the cheesily-sexy breathy French chick rattling off corny lines addressed to the film's lead character. And \\"Callas Went Away,\\" although it doesn't appear here, and in spite of the fact that it is likewise bursting with cheese-corn, actually makes me feel like I'm in the middle of some forest sporting around with nymphs and fauns and Yanni. Credit where credit is due.)
B0007DAZW8|2.0|But it still is not worth buying. Human After All simply doesn't have the effect as dance music as Discovery and Homework have. 'Television Rules The Nation', 'Steam Machine', and 'On/Off' are probably the worst songs on the album, and the worst songs Daft Punk have ever done. 'Emotion' and 'Make Love' are just weak. 'Technologic' is like 'Teachers' and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' had a retarded child. 'Robot Rock' isn't bad until maybe 10 seconds after it starts; after which it's the exact same as those first 10 seconds. In a word, this album is repetitive. I wouldn't bother.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|In an era of film making where the studio's main concern is the opening weekend box office report, Napoleon Dynamite kicks that mentality in the family jewels with some sweet kung fu moves.<br /><br />By showing quality movies can come cheap and make a profit hopefully a new trend of big studio gambles on little movies made with more heart than moolah will emerge.  Napoleon Dynamite was made for under a million bucks and grossed over forty million in theaters.  Not to mention its phenomenal success on DVD.<br /><br />Jon Heder plays Napoleon(in the best performance by a new actor in 2004), a delusional geek who's claim to fame are imaginary numchuck skills and drawing mythical monsters.  He's awesome at tetherball(singles) and a whiz at political campaign strategy.  He's fond of tater tots and his lips are chapped.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time a movie had me laughing to the point of tears.  Boy was I cryin', I can admit it.<br /><br />An instant cult classic and 2004's funniest movie, Napoleon Dynamite is a treat for anyone who attended high school or is amused by life's little absurdities.  Even the soundtrack is hilarious.  Watch this movie and laugh.  If you don't there's something terribly wrong with you.<br /><br />P.S.  Vote for Pedro!
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I certainly don't think Daft Punk are ignorant about the effects this album is going to have and it's hard not to assume it's some sort of statement. And although I believe this statement (a cynical look at pop music) is engaging, the music never quite reaches that level of engagement.   Like most Daft Punk albums I approached Human After All as half art project, and I really liked it at first, and assumed it would grow with more listening.  Sadly, the first listen was the most exciting, while most Daft Punk albums grow richer over time.   I still appreciate the audaciousness and noisiness of it, but just wish there was a little more meat in this thing.  If nothing else, it poses a conceptual conundrum:  Can you make crappy music on an album about crappy music?
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is one of the best homages to Horror films I've ever seen.  Hilarious, bloody, and extremely well written; Shaun of the Dead is executed with blistering gusto and loving affection for the Horror genre.  Tribute is given in particular to the films of George Romero (um, just look at the title folks) and Sam Raimi(extreme close-up/quickshot, shovel to the head, \\"Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather\\").<br /><br />Shaun (played by Simon Pegg in one of 2004's breakout performances) is an affable loser, stuck in a dead end job with a lovelife on the rocks.  His only constant comforts are his unemployed couch potato/stoner friend Ed and drinks at his favorite pub, The Winchester.  After his girlfriend dumps him Shaun goes on an all night bender with Ed, never noticing the somewhat strange behavior some of the townsfolk are exhibiting.<br /><br />The next morning Shaun wakes up to one hell of a hangover and a world overrun by the walking dead.  Although it takes him a while to realize it.  This movie is so good because so many scenes are executed with dead on brilliance and near perfect comic timing.  That's one thing the Brits will always have over us Yanks, they're damn funny people.<br /><br />What follows is a harrowing and hilarious sequence of events as Shaun is suddenly thrust into the position of leader.  Whether he's using zombie mimicry as urban camouflage or wielding a cricket bat as a bludgeon, Shaun gets the job done.<br /><br />Shaun of the Dead is an amazing film, a cult hit for the new millenia. Its uncanny blending of Horror affinity (with some quite resplendent gore) and romantic comedy is a bright, shining glimmer of hope for the Horror genre. So get your Horror loving friends together and sit back for one damn fine show.<br /><br />P.S. The DVD is packed with tons of extras so make sure you check 'em out when you're done watching.
1591396190|5.0|Unlike most reviewers I come to Blue Ocean strategy as a marketer and product developer, rather than a strategic consultant.  I've used the Blue Ocean Strategy/Value Innovation toolset to help develop several new products and businesses, some for small startups and others for Fortune 500 companies.  I've also been developing products and businesses long before coming across the BOS toolset so can put the tools into perspective.    To summarize: Blue Ocean Strategy serves as a pragmatic rudder.  It isn't the ship itself: you still need creativity, good business insight, and -- when applicable -- clever engineers.  But it shows the marketer where to steer the energies of those teams so they're not forever caught in the traditional red ocean fights most businesspeople are accustomed to.    Under the \\"old\\" pre-Blue Ocean Strategy model marketers might spend a large amount of time and money navigating through red oceans: duking it out with competitors, suppliers, customers, and resellers a la Porter's Five Forces.      Blue Ocean Strategy instead provides a framework and tools to minimize or avoid that time consuming and often futile fight.  Blue Ocean Strategy guides the business and/or product developer to offerings so unique competition becomes irrelevant.    A summarization of the framework here would be superficial so, instead, I'll use an example.  When developing a new product that had traditionally been in the realm of purely functional -- with the traditional characters bickering over features and price -- I realized from a BOS six-paths study that the product had a counterintuitive emotional appeal.  Switching a marketing message from functional to emotional gave me a strategic advantage, substantively helping to differentiate my offering from others.    Whether you're a student studying product development, or the senior manager of a large company, I strongly recommend working with the value innovation methodologies outlined in Blue Ocean Strategy.
B000002J20|3.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans to me is like Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (and particularly Shine On...) in the sense that both have some good musical moments stretched out over too much time given to it. In another way it's like Genesis' Lamb Lies Down on Broadway in that they had four sides to fill, and they were going to fill it come hell or high water. <br /> <br />There are certain passages that are gems in the YES lexicon, but there seems to be a lot of extra, that wasn't intended to be filler I suppose, but it certainly isn't engaging (to me at least - and thanks to the age of the ipod I put YES on shuffle and have it in the background while I work and I was surprised by how many passages on TFTO capture my divided attention, so it's not all bad by any stretch). Though, with a straight through, undivided listen, by the end I feel like I've been around the same block a couple of times with a few mini-loops along the way.  <br /> <br />Attention span isn't the issue as I dig many other album-side or double side epics. But this stretches my patience. Putting four 20 minute tracks together seems contrived. If not, and the whole album as an entity in itself, why couldn't the multiple statements be broken up even more? There obviously was an attempt to say \\"we showed how mighty we were with an album side, this will really show you what we're made of!\\" It seems to have a lot of form over function in its track layout. Genesis' TLLDOB perhaps is improved by having the 4 sides fractured into more songs. <br /> <br />Perhaps if the material were segmented more logically, the music would have been better than it turned out to be. To keep the 4 song layout intact, it has a great feel that some of the musicians were merely along for the ride instead of adding punctuations of their own to make a combined statement as with the highest points in YES' output. <br /> <br />What Peter Gabriel did to Genesis' with TLLDOB, Anderson and Howe did to YES, make a very self serving double album that perhaps confused the other members and left them outside the box and the overall music suffers. <br /> <br /> <br />Still it IS YES and that counts for a lot in maintaining 3 stars.  <br /> <br />
B00004W19V|5.0|My mum videotaped Short Circuit when it was on ITV1. And even though it had moderate language, I enjoyed it thoroughly. My dad says he understands how they made a robot, but doesn't understand how they got it to act so well. I couldn't agree more! <br />The songs are great too, even though there aren't necessarily many. And I would like to know who sang \\"Who is Johnny\\" and where I can get it on soundtrack. <br />All in all, Short Circuit is, even in present years, a classic. I think you'll love it, and your kids will too... as long as you persuade them not to repeat said moderate language.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|I got only one thing to say....brilliant! It is truly a great album. I think that anything Joshua Homme does is brilliant. This album is real good and all the people that worked on it did a great job with it. QOTSA ROCKS!!!
B000683VI4|4.0|Upon my wife's insistence, I sat down and watched The Notebook with her.  I must admit that despite my reluctance at first to view the movie, I was quickly drawn in to the story and watched intently until the end.  I knew going in that it was a romance which didn't bode well, I thought.  But as it turns out, the plot and characters are just unique enough that you don't feel as if you've seen it all before. <br /> <br />Fans of romance films will likely dub The Notebook as the second coming of Gone With The Wind.  I will concur that it comes very close to being a truly great film, romance or otherwise.  There is a rare chemistry that exists between the two romantic interests in the film that ultimately carries the day for the movie.  You most definitely find yourself caring for these characters early in the story.  Once a movie achieves that it has half the battle won. <br /> <br />My criticism of this film is twofold.  First, while James Garner does a passable job in his role, he just seems miscast and appears to be a fish out of water in his scenes.  Perhaps I'm just so used to him playing gruff, tough guy characters that I won't allow myself to believe him as who he is in the film.  Or maybe he's so acutely aware of that reputation himself that he guilds the lily a bit in his scenes.  Either way, I feel there were better choices out there for his role. <br /> <br />The other criticism I have is germane to the story itself.  What was so great about this romance, is that pretty much all of it could indeed have happened in real life.  The film sets real world rules and plays by the them 99% of the time.  There are harsh realities everywhere in the film and it makes no bones about them.  You come to realize that perhaps things won't end happily ever after as most romances do.  The Notebook doesn't allow itself to drift into a fantasy existence where \\"the keeper of the stars\\" leads the principal characters by the nose.  But as the movie hits the finish line, it changesthose rules and crosses over.  There are two endings in the film, and I am not referring to a DVD extra that you can view.  I mean there are two endings that occur back to back.  One is the proper and natural ending that is in keeping with the rhythm and rules of the entire film.  It leaves to the imagination what we already know is an inevitability, but at the same time affords the audience a last chance at a bittersweet ending.  At that point the credits should have rolled and everyone would be talking about how this movie is one of the best romances ever made.  Alas, the story goes one step too far and isn't satisfied to let things end as they are.  An additional scene is played out and is the chronological ending, which is both entirely unnecessary and a bit of a cheat.  It appears as if the director just couldn't make up his mind which way to best end the film, so he just decided to punt and include both. <br /> <br />From the sound of it, you'd think I hated the film, but nothing could be further from the truth.  I was just frustrated at the way the ending was handled and how the rules that were adhered to for the length of the film were broken right at the end for an overly sentimental purpose.  It was unnecessary and took a 5 star film down to a 4 for no good reason.  It's still most certainly worth a purchase.  The acting, writing, cinematography and pacing are all superb.  I highly recommend the movie, but I'm quite sure that many will agree with me once they see it that the first ending was all this movie needed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I too like many others joined the Whedon camp late. I didn't get into Buffy and Angel until they were both off the air. And although my wallet does not thank me; my soul does. I am a true fan. Because of this I bought Firefly... it was Soooooooooo good. For every reason you could like a show. I don't even have to repeat, everyone before me has already said it all. I can't wait until he does something else. Whedon is truly a \\"god\\" to TV watchers everywhere.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbra Streisand's incredible career is concisely showcased in this beautiful album of duets. Working with some of the most prolific stars of her times, she blends and empathises with each artist's own particular style. Each song is unique, providing yet another angle of her amazingly dynamic voice. The Manilow duet is particularly nice. Two wonderful Jewish stars together...the noses...WOW! Duck, I think they're taking off!

B00005JL0I|1.0|It's a star-studded cast, but the story line lags badly in several places leaving the viewer wondering when the movie will finally end.  The sound track is a classic one featuring many of the premier musical performers of the middle to late 1960's.  I would buy the sound track rather than the film if I were you, which is also available through Amazon.com
0425170349|3.0|It's a pretty good book, but definitely can't match 'Without Remorse', which I read a year ago and still feels like Clancy's best thriller. I've played the 'Rainbow Six' video games, so I have a pretty good feel for the license. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it's gotta be said, this book definitely suffers from recurrent bouts of 'super hero syndrome'. The enemies never really seem like credible threats. The book is great, the characters are pretty cool, but that is about it. <br /> <br />It is a page turner, though. Well worth the money. The two flaws I named above are the biggest weaknesses this book has working against it, and the writing never really recovers. There is nothing wrong with being the best of the best, or elite. However, Clancy falls into the trap of cutting the characters very close to boring. We know they're good. But you have to repeatedly read passages of text showing how good the members of 'Rainbow' are.  <br /> <br />As I said before; not bad, but falls a bit flat after reading 'Without Remorse'. It's like a comic book; very satisfying, but despite being interesting, you won't be that affected by the story.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is where it all started.  There were science fiction movies before this (although aside from \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" they were pretty mediocre), but this one is special.  First, until \\"Star Wars\\", this was the ONLY science fiction movie ever made that had nothing to do with Earth.  It is mentioned a couple of times, but that's as close as it gets. <br /> <br />The relationships between the captain, his first officer, and the doctor may look familiar NOW because the original Star Trek triad came from here.  The movie makers hired an animator from Walt Disney Studios to do the special effects because nobody else could achieve what the director wanted.  And this movie was the origin of Robby the Robot.  <br /> <br />But at the heart of the film is still Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" -- an intelligent and thought-provoking premise brought up to date with grace and style.  Oh, there is some \\"50s baggage\\" -- the scientist's daughter is necessary for the formula movies of the time, and even Walter Pidgeon overacts from time to time -- but none of it detracts from the excellence of the film.   <br /> <br />That much is about the movie.  The DVD package is special in other ways as well.  The wide-screen presentation is necessary to appreciate the movie's grandeur.  The color restoration means that the sky is again green instead of blue.  (The green sky is homage to \\"After Worlds Collide\\", the 1930s sequel to the novel \\"When Worlds Collide\\".  In the sequel, the sky on the new planet contains a species of algae that produce hydrogen in a sac that allows them to float in the air.)  If you haven't seen this movie in all of its original splendor, you are missing a great deal of what made it special.
B000000W6R|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins' music that made the actual studio albums were, for the most part, nothing short of enigmatic, yet positively beautiful, otherworldly, mood-inducing and cathartic. The songs that didn't make the albums, however, are just as stunning and deserving of the attention from any Pumpkin fan. In fact, some of these songs could surpass some of the ones that actually made the albums; further evidencing the need to own the B-sides.<br /><br />_Pisces Iscariot_ is a collection of B-sides and outtakes deriving mostly from the _Siamese Dream_ sessions, while a couple derive from the _Gish_ sessions, and one track is taken from the (now) hard-to-find _Lull_ EP.<br /><br />A reviewer below makes a great observation: _Pisces Iscariot_ doesn't feature the overall grandiose, bombastic consistency of mood found on _Siamese Dream_ and subsequent Pumpkins studio albums. Instead, there's more of an intimate, lo-fi and subtly nostalgic mood that permeates these recordings. But, regardless, the trademark Pumpkins' mix of soft, dreamy ambience, and overdriven sonic extremeties are here aplenty.<br /><br />Some of my favorites: \\"Soothe\\" is a track recorded in Billy Corgan's bedroom. An intimate, low-key acoustic track featuring autumnal chords, which provide as the backdrop for Billy's equally intimate, breathy mannerisms. \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\" is a retro-sounding rocker with a tint of psychedelic mannerisms. The swirling guitars, the precise, yet seductively-rhythmic drumming from Jimmy Chamberlain (this guy was mind-blowing on the kit), and D'Arcy's bottom-heavy basslines coalesce to create this indescribably beautiful number.<br /><br />\\"Whir\\" is simply one of the most preciously beautiful things this band ever did, and they have done many, to say the least. The dreamy melody, punctuated by the strumming of the seemingly-unplugged strings, the willowy, subtle line overdubs, and Billy's breathy vocals are some of the few things that help to create this monumental beauty. The minor-key ending was a nice way to round off this one. \\"Blew Away\\" is a dreamy number by James Iha. The first part starts off slow, only to end on a heavier note.<br /><br />The next two songs are the Pumpkins at their explosive best: \\"Pissant\\" is almost punk-like in it's rhythm and lyrics, yet you would rarely find overdriven guitars as thick and heavy as this in most punk songs. \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" is almost ambient in it's heaviness; the heaviness and overdriven sonics are so extreme, that it nearly crosses over into house & techno. The wall-of-sound is massive here, and Billy's soft voice is beautifully drowned in the explosive mix. It creates a wonderful effect, and the noise only gets more intense as the song progresses. What's more astounding? The noise is actually melodic and almost trance-inducing.<br /><br />After those last two sonic powerhouses, we are brought back into the band's softer side. \\"Obscured\\" is a beautifully-meandering, mood-inducing number, which actually ends on an eerie, fuzzed-out note. \\"Landslide\\" is the Pumpkins' cover of the famous Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac track. Billy and gang actually did a nifty job on this performance. Billy claims that this song is quite an inspiration on him, and that he highly identifies with it. \\"Starla\\" is an 11-minute powerhouse. Starts off smoothly and melodically, with a few psychedelic-like backdrops. Then, later, it concludes with a swirling, drawn-out instrumental jam that you could easily lose yourself in.<br /><br />Not much else needs to be said. If you're a Pumpkins fan, you won't want to be without it. Of course, if you really are a Pumpkins fan, you already do have it. But, by the subtle chance that you fall into the former, you've got my recommendation, to say the least.ce way to round off this one. \\"Blew Away\\" is a dreamy number by James Iha.

B00005JO0J|5.0|I have seen the movie (advance screening), but I'm not giving any spoilers. It's not something you tell, it's something you live. It's the best work I've seen of Joss Whedon... yet: it's funny, it's smart, and it's heart-breaking. It's 2 hours long, but 6 hours would still have gone by quickly. For those who haven't seen the series Firefly, don't worry, meeting the crew of Serenity and caring about them is easy. Stop caring, that's just *NOT* possible. Thank you Joss :)
B00026WU82|5.0|Dylan during the 60's is awesome, his vocals are much better then one later releases. His lyrics are as good as they have ever been. The songs are so well done that only Beatles, Roling Stones and a few others come close to this kind of genius.  The photo on the cover is very nice with a young Dylan. The book-let is a cheap story with a not much of anything in it at all. I love his lyrics. There are few artists that can write these kind of lyrics, and he is one of the best ever.
0792844890|4.0|Mel Brooks is notorious for poking fun at movies, even his own. The bits on merchandising are a riot. This movie pokes lots of jabs at \\"Star Wars\\", and a few at others like \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and \\"Alien\\". Fans of Brook's movies will definitley want to catch it. Anyone that likes comedies or SciFi should get a kick out of it too.<br /><br />Great cast with Mel himself, Bill Pullman, John Candy, Daphne Zuniga, Joan Rivers, Rick Moranis, George Wyner, Dick Van Patten, John Hurt, and many more. When Zuniga/Princess Vespa and her robot Rivers/Dot Matrix is kidnapped, by Brooks/President Skroob and Moranis/Dark Helmet, her father Patten/King Roland offers a million space bucks to Pullman/Lonestar and Candy/Barf to rescue her.<br /><br />After they rescue her they have to crash land on a desert planet where they meet Brooks/Yogurt and the Dinks. Yogurt teaches Lonestar how to use the Schwartz. When they return to Vespa's planet they are just in time to see her planet is under attack from a giant maid with a vacuum cleaner. Lonestar must battle the evil Dark Helmet with their light Schwartz's to save the day.<br /><br />This one definitely goes in the annuls of Brooksmania. What can I say I loved \\"Blazing Saddles\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\", and I love this one too. Not much in the way of extras on this version, but you can't beat the price. The DVD has good picture and sound quality.
B000002C2E|4.0|This 1997 release is very good, but no it is not some of his best stuff. His vocals are not as good as they were years past and that is why it gets 4 instead of 5. His lyrics are as good as they have always been, but the vocals are a big question mark. They sound very weak. The sound is nice and laid back and good music to listen to and drink some whiskey after work. The book-let is an insult to good taste and it is quite shoddy as is the front photo. It is out of focus and looks like a 10 year old kid decided to play around with a camera. I like the fact though that one can see who played what on each track. This is a quite good album.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Peter Berg does a creditable job in chronicling the exploits of the Permian high school football team of Odessa, Texas in 1988.  Odessa, an economically depressed town in east Texas lives for Friday nights when it's heralded Panthers march toward their goal of the Texas state championship.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton as football coach Gary Gaines attempts to mold his team into a fearsome and together unit amid enormous pressure and scrutiny from the town to win at all costs.  His 17 year old players shoulder a gargantuan responsibilty in representing their town who seemingly possess no other sense of pride.  Permian's drive to the playoffs encounters a major obstacle when star running back Boobie Miles played by a swaggering Derek Luke tears up his knee.  The team must pull together to overcome this set back as they are still expected to go all the way.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" plays very much like the football version of the movie \\"Hoosiers\\".  Thornton does an adequate job in his portrayal of the beleaguered coach.  Tim McGraw playing the demanding father of one of the players was especially good in his role.  The movie evokes pathos in that it reveals the shallowness of the lives of the denizens of this Texas town.  The cinematography and football footage was very authentic and impressively displayed.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|This is a great album, but his vocals seem to have suffered a bit and his once great looks have been ravaged by time. The photos makes him look old and tired and his singing has taken a turn fot the worst. Nice hat though.  I love his ability to write seemingly wordy lyrics that still manage to work. This is a very nice album, that fits perfect after a hards day work whilst drinking  a beer or drink. Tracks such as Floater, Cry a while show that this is an artist that is here to stay and he is almost a legend by now.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|But it is supposed to be entertaining whereas The Iliad was homework. A big, flaccid, on location, away from Hollywood flop. Thanks to dvd no Brad Pitt movie ever loses money. Troy just isn't very good. Lots of 21st century guys in ancient costumes talking like 21st century guys. Brad Pitt worked out for this. He is buff & everything. He is a good actor, which is not to be confused with a very good or great actor. His legions will love it (Brad Pitt without his pants). The action & fight scenes are excellent. Production is excellent.  But after nearly three hours I wasn't interested in investing any more time, so I passed on the extras.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee of evanescence is not only beautiful but her voice is so very sensuous.  She displays such emotion in her voice that you are moved inside and she shows this on her song \\"my immortal.\\"  I, like many others, enjoyed the song \\"bring me to life\\" that was heavily played on the radio and deservedly so, but it is not evanescence's best song.  I recommend this album, you will not be disappointed and you will impatiently await the next one like myself.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Excellent acting  -- <br />Jimmy seems to have just stayed in his life of mafia crime.  Heading up the Savage brothers.  All relatives.  Was his second wife egging him on.  Because of her daughters was there jealousy? <br />How did he feel about the brutalizing of Davey? <br />Dave, of course, was still living with the trauma he suffered as a child.  Yet he still seemed to be a loving husband and father.  Was he the last one to see Jimmy's eighteen year old daughter?  What was she doing at the bar anyway? <br /> <br />Sean was having his own problems with his wife.  Yet he kept up an intense search for the killer of Jimmy's daughter.  It was spine-tingling to watch the clues unfold.  When you thought you knew who the killer was something else popped up. <br />And was Dave's wife eyeing Sean?  Good thing his wife and daughter showed up. <br /> <br />The character of Jimmy proves that mob control never leads to justice.  What a ratty character. <br />Dave's trauma was powerfully moving - he had my sympathy. <br />Sean seemed to be cool and controled in the midst of chaos even with his own problems. <br />This was a combination of some very powerful acting of both the men and women involved. <br /> <br />It must be viewed with sensitivity and an open mind to be able to catch all of the nuances of tragedy involved.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I love this album by the White Stripes, and their album \\"elephant\\" is certainly right up there with great rock albums.  I first heard the single \\"seven nation army\\" on the radio and fell in love with this album.  The chords they play are so simple yet addicting that you cant help but notice the genius in their play.  I'm sorry to big strokes fans but The white stripes are on another tier.  And I would like to comment on the critic MusicalGenius \\"Jeremy\\" who posted a comment attacking the white stripes because their title is elephant, and did not include elephants.  How stupid is this guy, he should not be let out of the house, he might mistaken a pun or innuendo.  An ignorant comment like his cannot stand without criticism.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|I really liked Hitch.  It starts out a little slow, but then once the plot thickens, it gets really funny and stays that way till the end.  I have seen it twice.  When I left the first one, I said I wanted to see it again and that is unusual for me!  I say \\"Go see it.\\"
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen. I am a true werewolf fan and these are some of the best I have seen. And to some people's dismay, the werewolves are actually real people inside those suits. Even the part where there are running down the walls of the hallway. Very little CGI in this movie which is what makes it great. Kate Beckinsale looking hotter than ever in the leather also puts on a great touch. This movie is by far one of the best I have seen as far as the transformations. You don't see much of them but they are still scary none the less. Nonstop action from the minute the movie starts. These are what I pictured werewolves to be when I was growing up, large and very in charge. Great movie to watch when you want someone to be scared and jump a little bit.
B000002J09|5.0|Come on, this album is a rock classic. Rock, blues, folk, funk... Led Zeppelin IV has got it all. This one's made many a \\"Favorite Albums\\" list since it's November 1971 release, and with good reason. Not one bad song on here. Here's a rundown of each song:    1.) Black Dog - The album starts off with this familiar rocker. Robert Plant's soulful, siren-like voice goes against Jimmy Page's buzzsaw riff and the driving, funky rythym of John Paul Jones and John Bonham (RIP). Everybody's heard this one sometime before, it's a rock classic.    2.) Rock And Roll - The uninitiated might recognize this from the Cadillac commercials. This is the album's hardest rocker, and boy does it kick! To this day, this one will pump you full of adrenaline and make you want to do 100 MPH in the Autobahn. And Bonham's drum solo at the end is crazy.    3.) The Battle Of Evermore - Possibly my favorite on the album. A soft, ethereal ballad that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. \\"Dance in the dark night, sing to the morning light...\\" Very underrated song.    4.) Stairway To Heaven - Do I really need to explain this one? Masterpiece.    5.) Misty Mountain Hop - Mid-tempo, moderate rocker about life in the late 1960's/early 1970's. You might know this one from the movie \\"Almost Famous\\" (when they arrive in NYC). Good one.    6.) Four Sticks - The title for this song comes from the fact that Bonham played this with... four sticks. Cool, huh? Decent song, not quite up to par with the other seven, but still good.    7.) Going To California - Beautiful acoustic folk ballad about searching for your hopes and dreams, or a girl that has \\"never, never been born\\".    8.) When The Levee Breaks - Beastie Boys fans might recognize the familiar beat of this one as the beat sampled in \\"Rhymin' and Stealin'\\". Great closer for a great album.    Anyway, if you want a great classic rock album (because you're sick of the foolishness being unleashed upon us these days... can someone please explain Kayne West to me?), pick this one up, along with the rest of Zep's catalogue, Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", et cetera. Your ears will thank you.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Getting this record, i expected to get about two good songs, and a bunch of (...). I did not think that the political theme could support the entire album. I was so wrong. The whole thing is not political, alot is social commentary, not just bush-bashing. They make fun of anarchy, which proves that they are not stupid unfoucused government hating punks. I think nofx are very smart actually, and the lyrics that they write, though not beutiful, are insightful and clever.     The seperation of church and skate 5/5  -simply an awsome song, kinda like old bad religion. Very influenced by nofx's last work(and greatest song ever) the decline. One of the best on the record.    The irationality of rationality 4.5/5  -another decline influenced song, with great lyrics, just not as loud and angry as seperation so it kinda comes short after hearing that.    Franco un-american 5/5  -sort of radio friendly, but still cool. It's funny, yet political. The lyrics are just where they should be. And i think that the keyboard ads to the coolness. Everything works with this song.    The idiots are taking over 5/5  -best song on the album. Great lyrics, intensly influeced by the decline, very nofx song. Perfect in every way. One of nofx's all time best songs.    She's nubs 4/5  -really funny song, nofx could not get through an album without a  funny song. It would fit better in pump up the vallum, but this cd needed it. Not perfect, and because its funny, it also gets old, but still really cool.    Mattersville 4.5/5  -This one is kinda funny, with better music than shes nubs. Another decline influenced song. This whole cd was influenced by nofx's best song ever.    Decom-posuer 4/5  -really cool song with cool guitar. classic nofx.    Medio-core 5/5  -this song is so cool. It makes you nod your head and agree with everything he says. Starts soft and becomes hard. All about how music is not original anymore. awsome song.    Anarchy camp 4/5  -this one has really grown on me. The lyrics are funny, and it's a ska song. It thought it sucked at first, but its actually really good. I love this song. Not nofx at its best, and i prefer punk, but its is so cool.    American errorist (i hate hate haters) 4/5  -this song is really awsome, but its to short. Maybe if he used all the lyrics(fat mike literally sings only half of the lyrics written on the sheet)it would be better. I wish it was longer, then it would be one of the best of the cd.     We got two jealous agains 4.5/5  -cool song about meeting his soulmate, by seeing what cd's she owns. Gives credit to all of the sick awsome 80's hard-core street punk. Its got sex pistols(they're 70's) black flag, circle jerks, early vandals, misfits, and a bunch more. Really cool song  crediting all of his roots.    13 stiches 3.5/5  -This song is so sick. But its missing something. Its like it's all leading up to a blast of punk at the end, but it's soft all the way through. Bummer, cuz i like this song.    Re-gaining unconsciousness 5/5  -THis is one sick song. Its awsome from start to finish, and it is another decline influenced song. really really cool.    Whoops, i OD'd 4.5/5  -since when does nofx speak abouth the dangers of drugs? ten years earlier they wrote a song called drugs are good that said drugs are good they make you do things that you know you not should, and when you do em people think that your cool. But this is a great song to end and awsome album with.     NoFx seems to keep getting better, although i don't think this beats out punk in drublic, nofx keeps honing there skills and composing music that is original, that no ones ever heard. Get this cd. Down with bush. This cd is all about constructive critisism. We want to make the government better, not kill it. I read a review on here from some guy named jollygreenmetalhead 2002. He said punk is antigovernment, and unaccepting of other people. Yet fat mike says in the lyrics booklet that he loves this country. You say that were not accepting, andyou call modern punks biggest gathering, the warped tour, a (...) festival. Seems like your not accepting punks and gays. You see we are all about excercising are freedoms, wich is why america rocks. so get this cd and be amazed by the almost punk(real punk has been dead for awhile) and get the decline for the best think nofx has ever done.
B00005JLEX|2.0|The case the dvds come in is flimsy and worthless and all the dvd cases look the exact same from the side so if you have multiple seasons you can't tell what disc is from what season and you just can't tell one disc from another by looking at the cases.  Doesn't make me want to collect them at all, just makes me want to buy them to watch one time then sell.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|It is impossible to review a sequel without first mentioning the movie which gave rise to it.  \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" is a wonderful film, sweet, sexy, full of pathos, humor, and yes a bit of the absurd.  The sequel is not up the prequel, but I think it is two different films in one.  The first part oscillates wildly between edginess and slapstick, disconnected scenes which seem to exist only to convince us that Bridget is horribly conflicted.  It is also terribly predictable.  Then, entirely unpredictably, the film reverts to the format that made the prequel so good.  Bridget's struggles enchant the viewer, and a mild surprise enlivens the film.  I give it four stars because the second part is so good, though I understand why others would give it only two or three stars.  The music, BTW, is very good.
B000002USN|3.0|Let's say that you're Capitol Records, and you've just re-signed your biggest star from the 1950s, Frank Sinatra.  Here it is the 1990s, so what can you do with Sinatra?  The guy's in his late 70s and he doesn't want to learn any new songs.  Maybe you could have him re-record some of his old songs, but why would anybody buy those same old songs again?  Maybe you could have him re-record the songs as duets with other singers.  But Frank's an old man, he can't be running back and forth to the recording studio every time another singer shows up in town.  So, just have him record all the songs in one recording session, and then overdub the other singers later.  Yeah, that's what you would do.<br /><br />Duets is a decent album.  Sinatra's voice was shot, but he still was great at phrasing the songs, despite his vocal limitations.  The arrangements of the songs are generally good, too.  As for the duet partners, some of them blend better with Frank than others.  I could tell you which ones I prefer, but everyone has a different opinion, so what would be the point?  This is a \\"love it or hate it\\" album for a lot of people.  Me, I fall somewhere in the middle.  It's not a complete disaster, but it's not a complete success, either.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|underworld was a pretty good movie. which has alot of action. and i was impressed with most of the scenes from this movie.
B000003TAL|5.0|I first heard Daydream Nation when I was 15 and it completely blew me out of the water.  I was really into Hendrix and Zeppelin at the time, like a lot of 15 year olds, and I honestly questioned the band's sanity.  Sonic Youth represented something radical, chaotic, mysterious, sexy, and completely alien to me.  This is the album that introduced me to the underground.  Listening to Daydream Nation is like coming home.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Overall, this was the greatest Wrestling event ever. It was suspensful, surprising, and exciting. Besides the matches, their were amazing promos and the interviews were pretty good. Here are the matches: <br /> <br />1. John Cena vs. Big Show  8/10 <br />US Title on line. Match went pretty slow but John Cena made the match good with his F-U''s on Big Show, to win the match.  <br /> <br />2. Fatal 4-way for World Tag Team Championships 7.5/10 <br />RVD and Booker T vs. Renee Dupree and Rob Conway vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley <br />This match had its moments, but overall, it wasnt the greatest match. The ending was pretty entertaining with Booker T hitting the scissors kicka and RVD hitting the Frog Splash to win it. <br /> <br />3. Christian vs. Chris Jericho 9/10 <br />This match was really exciting. Both guys gave it their all and did some really nice high-flying moves. Surprise ending when Trish Stratus comes out and
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Another incredible experience from QOTSA, after an intro that's mournfull and brewding get ready to be lost in the deserts after sundown with songs that are HARD and DRIVING, sometimes raw and edgy, sometimes trippy and spooky.    <br />You'll find elements of ALL your favorite QOTSA albums crafted into Lullabies and beyond.   <br />'In My Head' a great rock song combined with Joshua's awesome and unique falsetto voice is one of my favorites on the album.      <br />
B0000039PW|5.0|In 1994, The Notorious B.I.G. came out with what I think is the greatest rap album ever created.  Biggie had an amazing rhyme style which he unleashed in every single song.  He could change his style from song to song and still managed to keep in character.  He made songs that showed what he knew about when he was growing up hustling.  His raps are easy to understand but he manages to still make them outstanding. Biggie's loose and easy flow made his songs great.  When he begins to pile multiple rhymes on top of one another you know you're hearing a classic.  My favorite aspect of The Notorious B.I.G. is his dramatic storytelling and how easily he slips in and out of different characters.    1. Intro - Nice intro to introduce The Notorious B.I.G. into the game.     2. Things Done Changed - Very deep song.  Great to start off this album. Really defines himself with this song about changes. \\"Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us. Look at em now, they even f***ing scared of us!\\" 10/10     3. Gimmie The Loot - Classic track. Biggie flawlessly portrays two different characters.  This song is funny and has some classic lines. \\"I wouldn't give f*** if you're pregnant. Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant!\\" 10/10     4. Machine Gun Funk - Great lyrics, great beat and sample. \\"Relentless approach, to know if I'm broke or not, Just cause I joke and smoke a lot, Don't mean I don't tote the glock.\\"  10/10      5. Warning - A great song.  One of his best actually.  This song shows Big's storytelling ability and manages to inject some humor and his lyrics are perfect. \\"There's gonna be a lot of slow singin, and flower bringin if my burgular alarm starts ringing.\\" 10/10     6. Ready To Die - Classic song.  Biggie tears up the 1st verse and when you hear him finish off the verse, you know it's a classic. 10/10     7. One More Chance - Good song with a good beat.  Not a standout track in my opinion but it's still great. The phone messages in the beginning areannoying though.  8/10     8. #!*@ Me - Strange skit.  Go ahead and skip it.  Definately not worth a second listen.    9. The What - One of the rawest songs on the album.  It features Method Man who completely tears it up.  As usual, Biggie holds his own. \\"Excuse me, flows just grow through me like trees to branches, Cliffs to avalanches. It's the praying mantis.\\" 10/10     10. Juicy - A now classic song about growing up in the hood and finally making it big. 10/10    11. Everyday Stuggles - Great song about growing up in the ghetto.  Nice deep song with nice beat and great lyrics. \\"Packed up my tools for my raw power moves. Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves. For chumps tryin to stop my flow, and what they don't know will show on the autopsy.\\" 10/10    12. Me & My B*tch - Great song about his girl who met a sad fate.  Big manages to lay some deep rhymes throughout this depressing story.  \\"She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies.Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger. One day, she put 911 on the pager.\\" 10/10    13. Big Poppa - Now a classic song.  Not really much to be said about it that hasn't already been said. 10/10    14. Respect - Good song with a Reggae twist. BIG just rapping about his ascent in the world since birth.  Tight rhymes as usual. \\"I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy. The doctor looked and said, 'He's gonna be a Bad Boy'\\" 9/10    15. Friend Of Mine - Probably my least favorite song on the album but BIG still manages to lay out some nice rhymes in this song about girls cheating. 7/10    16. Unbelievable - Pretty nice beat but once again, it's Biggie's rhymes that carry this song.  \\"Rappers can't sleep, Need sleepin. Big keep creepin, Bullets heat-seekin, Casualties need treatin, Dumb rappers need teachin.\\" 9/10    17. Suicidal Thoughts - My Favorite song on Ready To Die.  BIG's rhymes are flawless and he manages to explain everything he feels he's done wrong that justifies his suicide.  Classic and depressing ending to a classic album. 10/10
B0002OERI0|1.0|Why don't you get bombed you stupid anarchist punks. These types of morons want to mess with the country and if they got the country they would not do s**T. Why don't you grow up you stupid punks. The only good song is Bolevard of Broken Dreams.
B00004BZ16|1.0|As the party line goes, on \\"Sandinista,\\" the Clash experimented with reggae, dub, rap, world music, jazz, rockabilly and disco.     Everything but good songs.     Which is what has made this album - originally released as a three-LP set - one of the great enigmas in rock. Somehow, because it was made by a band whose earlier work had earned justifiably high praise, \\"Sandinista\\" is commonly accepted to be a sort of masterpiece in its own right. Seldom has critical opinion been so alarmingly off the mark.     For while the great early work of the Clash (the first three albums) commanded the attention of the listener and crackled with energy and passion, \\"Sandinista\\" just sits there. The roar, the power, even the pop smarts of the Clash's great work - the things that made you love this band in the first place - are nowhere to be found.     But \\"Sandinista\\" is not merely a bad album. It's also a cynical, arrogant album. It's the sound of a band believing its own press. A band so blinded by adulation that it utterly forgot what made it great in the first place. Just lend an ear to such clinkers as \\"Hitsville U.K.,\\" \\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe,\\" and the kiddie-song remake of \\"Career Opportunities.\\" Could Jones, Strummer and crew possibly have thought these were good ideas...or were they so convinced of their own importance that they believed ANYTHING they put out was inherently great?     So, with this very long album, the Clash showed us what a bore it can be when a stellar band just flat runs out of steam. It's been lauded for its breadth of style but, curiously, seldom called on the carpet for being chock-full of truly terrible songs. But for all its sprawl and incoherence, \\"Sandinista\\" does beg an interesting question: Because we love a band's early, GREAT work, are we somehow obliged to like or defend its later AWFUL work? The answer, of course, is no.
B0000CABBW|5.0|How refreshing to find a film that feels more like you're observing a slice of life than a watching a big Hollywood blockbuster.<br /><br />WHALE RIDER is the story of Paikea, the female surviving twin and most recent decendant of her Maori tribe's line of chiefs.  But leadership does not extend to girls in their tribe, and her grandfather tries to find the \\"true chief\\" among boys in the village by conducting lessons of strength and endurance.  Pai (played extremely effectively by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes) is not allowed to join in these lessons, but her indomitable spirit is not crushed by her grandfather's rejection.  There are excellent supporting characters, such as Pai's grandmother, uncle, and often-absent father.  Each of these supporting characters help play a part in molding her character into a young woman with the leadership qualities her grandfather is looking for in others.<br /><br />This is a very well-made movie because it doesn't feel like a movie.  You are simply watching these colorful characters live their lives, exert their beliefs, and become one with their beautiful New Zealand surroundings.  It is a treat for anyone who likes a quality film as well as for young people who can appreciate a fine story.  Enjoy--
B00005JLKN|3.0|I am not familiar with the book, and never saw this one in theatres, which I think now was a good thing. <br />It might have been the script or the acting, but it certainly wasn't the major actors's faults, given the range and quality of the entire cast, but I wasn't left with as much a sense of dread as with \\"the Silence of the Lambs\\". It's as if the actors weren't really \\"into\\" their roles. This film wasn't nearly as scary or psychologically thrilling as Silence, and it's hard not to compar the two. Instead, it felt very much like a rehashing of the same script - Hannibal Lecter (much, much weaker here, I must say) helps an FBI agent track down a killer. <br />And Ralph Fiennes cast as an \\"ugly\\" psychopathic killer? I beg to differ. He pulled the role off well enough, but I wasn't convinced that he was really murderously dangerous. Creepy and disturbed and definitely demented (he does that so well), yes, but I just wasn't convinced. He's perfectly capable of pulling off that kind of person, which made it so much more of a disappointment to me. <br />Also, the Tattler Reporter didn't strike me as being or having very much to be afraid of. I just didn't sense the horror. D's picture show was gruesome, but that was the only scary thing about his revealing himself and his tatoos. <br />And not knowing the original ending doesn't mean that I wasn't disappointed with ending. I found it weak and anticlimactic. There was just something about this film that just didn't work. Pity.
B00070Q7VO|1.0|This was good when I listened on my stereo to a couple of songs, but when I went to import it into itunes for playing on ipod, it will not see the CD. If you are interested in putting this on your ipod don't buy this CD. (Windows Media Play will not recognise this CD either)

0753506483|5.0|\\"Losing my virginity\\" is an entertaining page-turner all the way from the beginning to the end. It is fascinating to read about what a mildly dyslexic man with no college education could create for himself.<br /><br /> Richard Branson is a man with a zest for life and all its challenges. Fun lies at the core of everything he does. The best part is he makes money doing what he does. His social circle includes a wide variety of people that include his small-town neighbours, Peter Gabriel, Queen Noor and Rod Stewart.

B00004XQP4|5.0|absolutely everyone in sight is going to tell you NOT to buy this album. something about sell-outs, rah rah rah, not being punk enough, etc.    newsflash: NO ONE CARES.    is it good music?, can the album sustain itself?, do i like what i hear?    these are the questions you should be asking.    and when i thought about it, my answers to all of those questions was YES. this is rad music which sounds nothing like dookie. we should be giving green day cheers for that. why would we want another dookie-sounding disc so many years later?    \\"fashion victim\\" is a direct relation to our current materialistic standards with a fantastic beat, and is in my top three songs on this record. the other two would be \\"blood, sex and booze\\" and \\"macy's day parade\\" (which, for the record, beats \\"good riddance\\" hands down). the album also features a five minute song (\\"misery\\") which incorporates the story of four people, which might have been the prelude to green day's new concept album, american idiot.    really, after nimrod, it was hard not to see this coming. it was a turning point in their music where they thought, \\"hey, screw this. i've got better music to write than standard punk 3-chord music.\\" you've got to give them credit for writing a record they knew would cause so much controversy. because GUESS WHAT WORLD, this record was written because green day felt like it. and it shows. the complexities in the music are high above the likes of dookie and insomniac.    however, there is something missing from this record that made it seem so foreign to listeners: that \\"green day energy\\" which is present in every other album they've produced (including american idiot, thank you very much). it's a little too slow, it's a little too soft. green day weren't meant to quite go to those depths. but for their first delve into such a mature, unique sound, they pulled warning off with close to flawless music.    just goes to show how versatile green day are.

B0007DAZW8|4.0|The boys have learned alot in their tims as musicians.Human After All is an engaging concept album put forth by Daft Punk. Its cynical twist on today's modern music proves to be a huge success. To say that this CD is `too repetitive' is like saying Homework was \\"too repetitive\\". Am I the only person who has learned that Daft Punk is basically all about repetition? This collection of 10 pop tracks has a significant Daft Punk sound about them all, and this record will be treasured for a long time to come.    1. Human After All - The track on the album which comes closest to conveying any image of human qualities, with a cynical, happy, repeating melody throughout. Robotic voices galore, this track is about as far from being human as you can get. 9.5/10    2. Prime Time Of Your Life - This track is the epitome of what this album is about - being fake. Commercialism overrides everything you hear, including this track which puts forth a huge statement in its simplicity. It quickly evolves into an incredibly alien sound as the speed reaches thousands of beats per minute. Incredibly artistic. 9/10    3.Robot Rock - Musically, not the best track on the album but is a huge favourite of mine in what it conveys - the songs starting guitar riff shows potential to evolve into such a great song, but it never actually changes except for some underwhelming breaks within the song. The promising riff is repeated for about 5 minutes and falls flat on its own back. A perfect track - commercialism really is turning us all (including musicians) into robots. 9.5/10    4. Steam Machine - An incredibly alien, foreign sounding sound brought to Earth by the hissing humanoid voice Steam... Machine... The first track you could actually dance to and is very reminiscent of Homework... The same inhumane, cold, clinical sound plays throughout, lulling you into a tense, anxious world. The only reason it doesn't reach a perfect 10 is because rather than being overly musical, its concept is one I findamazing... An artistic challenge almost won over by Daft Punk. 9/10    5. Make Love - Cool, straightforward Acid House from D.P. Yet again, another fantastic pop song twisted in its cynical way emphasizing the fact that today's music really is robotic and unchanging. The promising start follows in the same vein of Robot Rock for 3 minutes until the only change throughout the song happens - a male, very human, very cool voice chants Make Love... The cool piano accompaniment throughout adds to the theme of the song - a pleading, human cry floating somewhere in the universe. Simply amazing. 10/10    6. The Brainwasher - Here we come crashing back down to Earth with its repetitive, brainwashing beats and pounding rhythms. Another song which perfectly encapsulates the feel of the album, a cynical, instrumental rant about the farce that is pop music, brainless, mindless, brainwashing music. Musically, it's pretty funky too. 9.5/10    7. On/Off - Not so much of a song, pretty disappointing that this is featured on a 10 track album. Adds very little in the way of flow of the album. 2/10.    8.Television Rules The Nation - A pounding, alien track, creating feelings of inanity and an insightful look into the mediocre world of today's music and its ruling factors. Pretty good track, but the theme has been done over and over in the album. I get the cynicism already! 6/10    9. Technologic -... and ANOTHER track along the same cynical viewpoint of today's culture. Humans are being taken over by all this rubbish, but the album has clearly fallen flat of its inspiration and ideas have been drained. Nonetheless it's still a pretty funky track. 7/10    10. Emotion - An upsetting song. It brings all the themes of the album into the one cheesy song, rampant with feelings of fake emotion, emotions that really don't exist. The generic, alien yet vaguely humanoid voice resounding throughout further emphasizes this point. The alien synths, everything comes together to symbolise exactly what this record is all about - the fake, cheesy state of commercialism today. A funky track also. 9.5/10    Not being a Daft Punk fan, I was astounded by this complete change in direction from D.P. Rather than releasing another Discovery (fusing genres together) or another beat driven Homework, they took yet another step forward and made a concept album based on what was happening in the crumbling subculture of labels and formulas around them. Daft punk were fully aware of what this album would mean to most, i.e. very little, repetitive drivel, but I can assure you all this was a huge step in the right direction. With their newfound sense of cynicism in todays pop culture, as well as everything they have learned and put forward in Discovery and Homework, D.P's next album will be yet another huge classic if they continue in this artistic vein. Their next album will truly be something to be in awe of. A heavily flawed, but nonetheless great CD, and perhaps one of the few true remaining dance 'artists' of the 21st century.    7/10.
B00000HZH7|5.0|I truly feel that Possessed is a band who do not get the respect that they should. Possessed were a band who weren't afraid to do what the wanted to do and they just sat down and mustered a loud, evil, rude, heavy type of metal resulting in death metal. That fact isn't shown better than by the album Seven Churches, the music is truly unbelivable. This band (and album) introduced growling vocals-picking up where Venom left off, an eerie melody weaved within the heavy and brutal guitar work, and even featured the movie \\"The Exorcist's\\" theme sound for an intro for the album. I highly reccomend this album.
1869504917|3.0|I went to New Zealand with the book, hoping to see as many sites as I could.  Everyone has the book, and everyone has the same comment - it gets you almost there.  Almost just isn't good enough.  But my first complaint is the scattered writing. Stick to the subject - the sites.  One site is mentioned.  Then a bunch of drivel, and suddenly you're reading about that site again, and this time it's different information.  The book could have so much better organized.  Why not put decent maps in a location guidebook?  One example: we followed the written directions exactly and found ourselves at the park off Gemstone.  Okay.  So, where exactly along this park is the site?  I searched for an hour for rock formations that matched the picture in the book and never found them.  Same thing at \\"Rivendell\\".  Got there, but what good is it if the exact sites are not given?  We ended up going out again the next day on a tour, and told the tour guide about our trouble with the book.  \\"Everyone says that,\\" she said.  \\"I see people out walking around with the book, trying to figure out the exact site.  Finally they ask if they can follow me.\\"  Ian, you present this as being a location guide, and you got everyone to buy one.  But I didn't go halfway around the world to get \\"almost\\" there.  It needs better pictures, real maps, and better organization.  Keep ALL the information about one site together, not spread here and there over several pages.<br /><br />Give directions from the major city, not from the previous site.  And I am still steaming over Legolas's rock at Deerpark Heights.  The picture shows the VIEW from the rock instead of the rock itself.  You know how many rocks are at the location?  Why is the world didn't you put a picture of the rock in there so we could tell when we were in the right place?  I appreciate the fact that someone even wrote a guidebook.  That said, it should have been done 100%.  I paid 100% of the price for it.
B000002L42|5.0|I don't know what these other reviewers were missing!  I saw SD live in 93, loved them, and was so glad to find this live album later.  Unlike a lot of bands making comebacks, they have not only not stagnated, but have kept growing musically, playing their old hits with new and exciting and dynamic rearrangements.  Much more jazzy, much more dynamic. The new live version of \\"Bodhisattva\\" is to die for!  The drummer and guitarist pump the band for all they're worth.  All the performances are sterling!  I think it's the best ever recording of a live rock band, any time, any where!
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|Definitely an album you need to work with. Not much is going to reach right out and grab you off the bat. Definitely a \\"headphone\\" kind of album. You need repeated listens to really grasp a lot of what is going on. There's actually some really neat, dare I say pretty, things going on. But it definitely lacks the chaos and aggression of a Nick O. project. Very simliar to the Rated R album IMO. Some tunes are straight up QOTSA, but some of the songs just don't go anywhere. You're waiting for something to happen and nothing is resolved. For now it's at the bottom of my QOTSA pile. That may change...................
B000002JOH|5.0|Umm, wow...just wow.  This album is absolutely amazing.  Mouth For War, best track for an opener.  A New Level, the second track, has just an unbelievable guitar riff to it that sticks in my mind for hours after i listen to it.  I havent had a chance to listen to the whole CD quite yet, but from what I have heard so far, this CD is totally worth your money if you are a Pantera fan or just a metal fan in general.  Great work Phil, Dime, Rex, and Vinnie. <br />
0385335482|3.0|OMG!Could this girl be any dumber? She Bullsh*t's her way through life. She lies to everyone she knows even her best friend. She is in debt so much that she can't figure out how to fix it. Then by some stoke of luck her life turns around and everything ends up peachy. Things like that would not happen in real life.
B00009V7P8|5.0|To give you an idea of where I am coming from.  Most commercial music that I come across, I usually find boring and unispiring.  It tends to bore me.  I search for my new music by looking through indipendent magazines and the web.   <br /> <br />I went and saw the movie \\"Closer\\", manely because of my enfactuation with Natalie Portman.  Basically I cannot get enough of her.  The movie opens with \\"The Blower's Wife,\\"  which at the time, I had no idea who sang it or the name of the song.  I believe that if any other song in the world would have been played, I would not have enjoyed the film.  This song opend and closed the film, and not just a fifteen second sound bite, but a good minute and a half in the beginning and the end.  This song, made you feel where otherwise You would not have.  This song triggered emotions in me that made the movie that much more enjoyable, and rewarding to watch.   <br />   So, after I came home from the movie, I hoped on the web and searched the web for the artist who wrote this song.  After I discovered that it was Damien Rice, I became a little skeptical, because I heard and seen his albums at trendy music stores and at the mall.  I figures that this album would contain this one gem, and the rest of the album would be non-sense.  Nevertheless, I bought the album. <br />    I was presently surprised by this album.  I have enjoyed it many times over.  I do not want to give too much of the music away, because I believe that the listener should buy and listen to this album with no preconcieved ideas.  The listener should form their own ideas and iterpertaions of the music, and the imagry in this album is quite suffient to do so.
1401300901|5.0|This was a great book. It will appeal to all the romantics out there. I couldn't wait to see what the next note contained. I couldn't stop reading it. It did have a few surprises in it, but good surprises.
B0007CNXUU|4.0|This is a good family movie. The author of Peter Pan with mixed success produces a hit play in turn of the century (early 1900s) England. He befriends a family and is inspired by the four boys to create a fantisyland play.  <br />Enjoyable to watch. Not my favorite movie but a good one!
B00005AR3G|4.0|When the movie starts you see a sad lama sitting in the dark. Then you hear the voice of David Spade and the fun starts. Animations are always mentioned in the lists of movies actors have made and deservedly so; ever since 'A Bugs Life' and 'Ants' have the on-screen animated figures started looking like the actors themselves, including the humor and antics.  <br /> <br />The story is the usual Disney. Good people vs Bad people, cool animations, a lot of songs, and a good dose of humor. Provided in the most part by David Spade and Patrick Warburton, you may remember him as Elaine's Boyfriend Puddy in Seinfeld or a small part in a few episodes of 'Newsradio', his dry, dumbwitted remarks are hilarious and the best thing about this movie.   <br /> <br />The theme song by Tom Jones is also funny (he is credited as 'theme song guy') and has the great line \\"an enigma and a mystery, in Meso-American history\\". <br /> <br />Even as an adult I had to laugh out loud sometimes. You can say what you want about Disney, they can deliver movies that suit 3 year olds through 103 year olds.  <br />
0385336810|5.0|Where to begin? This book is simply amazing.  From the first sentence I was hooked on this book.  I read it in 4 hours and read it again 2 weeks later.  This book rocks! It's funny and light hearted and you can relate to so many of the situations Emma, the main character, is put through.  This book is a must to add to your collection! I was extremly satisfied reading this book and cannot wait to start reading some of Sophie Kinsella's other books!
B0007CNXUK|3.0|Wonderful portrayal by Depp as J. Barrie and Kate Winslet, awesome.  The movie plodded a bit at times for me, but it really got me to appreciate the story behind Peter Pan.  Interesting.

I mean, the last time I was in Mobile, I was talking to this hot blonde in Whiskeys, and then this flathead comes up to me and gets REALLY aggro, I mean considering his girl is like half hair-spray, and goes mental on me like its not just a Saturday night thing, and he goes nuts whipping out a buck knife, so I go back to my Iraq-Z and get my shotgun and blow all the tires off his mustang and then hop back in and drive off and what can he do? NOTHING.  I give it a four because it was a bit too many words to say it, but good common sence none the less.

B0007QJ1N4|3.0|In the Amazon.com editorial review, Mr. Aidin Vaziri wrote,\\"the restless front man keeps things dependably loud and sludgy on the group's third album\\". I'd just like to let him know it is their fourth album. The first album was self-titled, then \\"R\\" or Restricted, Songs For the Deaf, and Lullabies to Paralyze. Just thought I'd set things straight. <br />
B00025ETIW|3.0|this is a realy good cd but i think that thid band will mainstream out wich realy sucks.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I know this film came out almost five years ago, but I just watched it again last weekend and I can't resist logging onto Amazon and telling you how inspiring this story is. <br /> <br />I'll skip talking about what a great actor Russel is (and he truly is) and jump right to the heart of the story.  Ridley Scott has created for us a tale of a man who was born to be a warrior but who at heart is a gentle, sad, kind hearted man who wants nothing more in life then to honor his wife and son, and the depths to which he searches his soul to reach that goal left me more aware of my own place in life and how I must strive harder to lead a more fulfilling existence.   <br /> <br />I don't see this as an action film.  Okay, I know that it IS of course, an action film, but to be honest the fight scenes are few and far between.  Yes, there is some blood and gore.  No, it is not excessive.  Yes, people die.  No, it is not glamorized. <br /> <br />The real story takes place out of the Coliseum and comes to life in the dialog:  Maximus (Crow) with his soldiers and fellow gladiators, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) with his sister, Commodus with the Senators, Maximus with the child Lucious.  The dialog is remarkably well written, and the acting is stunning.  THIS is where the real story takes place. <br /> <br />And to punch-down what was already a timeless masterpiece, the cinematography, the special effects and the music are humbling in their perfection.  Normally these are aspects of a movie I don't pickup on until the second or third time watching it, but in Gladiator ever element is so rich and beautiful that you can't help but be impressed with all of it from the very first time you watch it. <br /> <br />This film is not for everyone.  Despite how inspiring it is I don't think I would like my own son watch it until he is well, well into his teenage years.  But when he's ready, we will certainly enjoy it together.
B000002572|5.0|It was the Bicentennial Year: 1976. I was a sophomore in high school in a small midwestern town. Diso was on the rise and then Boston blew into our lives with this record and saved rock and the rest of our teenage years from the polyester plague. I had never heard such amazing guitar sounds - ever. Neither had I ever heard such soaring compositions in rock music. This album is a landmark in rock music history without any doubt. Every song is incredible - even though a few of them might be a bit dated these days - I believe most of them still stand strong over twenty years later. When I hear More Than A Feeling and Peace of Mind - I'm instantly transported to my teenage years - crusing in a Chevelle SS on a warn summer night and blazin' in the basement of my friend's house. It all comes back. Smokin' just reminds me of the parties. The entire album just defines my high-school years. Absolutely awesome - even almost thirty years later.
B0006399FS|1.0|You can add them to a growing list that also includes the likes of Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones - artists that were at one time highly artistic and credible but over time have gone on to completely lose their creativity.  Nowadays, an album for U2 means kicking out a couple of effortless, meaningless 3 minute pop songs (or maybe digging up some B-sides from their glory days back in the '80s) as an excuse to tour and make more money - as if they didn't have enough. <br /> <br />U2 is a band that undergoes a complete transformation at the dawn of every decade.  In the '80s, they were known for socially conscious, anthemic rock that was both earnest and heartfelt - 1987's The Joshua Tree catapulted them to ubiquity and cemented their status as superstars.  The '90s found them boldly reinventing themselves, experimenting with the textures of electronic music (which might have stemmed from their collaborating with producer Brian Eno) and immersing themselves in irony, without completely compromising the sound and vision of previous efforts.  Whether or not you enjoyed albums like Zooropa or Pop, you have to admire the effort and creativity that went into these albums, and U2's willingness to take chances despite being worldwide rock stars.  They still were capable of writing the passionate rock anthems that made them famous, like \\"Stay (Faraway So Close)\\" and \\"Please\\". <br /> <br />Going into the present decade, U2 was apparently dissatisfied with the sales of Pop (which did sell several millions), and released All That You Can't Leave Behind in the fall of 2000, hoping to win adulation from the media and masses.  Sure enough, they got their wish, but at the expense of their artistic integrity and credibility.  The whole album sounded like leftovers from The Joshua Tree sessions, only without the energy or passion of that album, and without anything as powerful and engaging as \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\".  It was either the sound of a band that either forgot how to writesongs and just decided to slap something together and call it a U2 album, or the sound of a band that decided to start worshipping the dollar and dumb down their material to appeal to the people that didn't understand Pop and Zooropa.  Whatever the case, people loved ATYCLB, and started proclaiming that U2 was \\"back\\" - they even won a few Grammy awards.  U2 was back, alright, but in sound rather than spirit - all the contributions seemed phoned in.  Larry Mullen Jr.'s advancement on the drums has faded, Adam Clayton's bass lines are buried in the slick production, Bono strains to hit the same notes he once reached with ease (must be the cigarettes), and The Edge is content to play the same famliar riffs over and over again .. ATYCLB was not evolution, it was regression. <br /> <br />As far as How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is concerned - no surprises here, as U2 knows what side their bread is buttered on.  They found a simple formula for success and don't tinker with it at all - it's another bland, safe, highly commercial pop/rock album that will find its way into many homes - and many elevators.  \\"Vertigo\\" opens with The Edge's guitar making like an ice cream truck and Bono, who apparently didn't have his translation guide on him at the time, shouting \\"Uno, dos, tres, catorce!\\" (1, 2, 3, 14!).  The rest of the song is as nonsensical as the intro, with lines like \\"As the boys play rock and roll / They know that they can't dance / At least they know\\" and \\"Your love is teaching me how / How to kneel\\".  Basically the only discernable statement the song seems to make is \\"We are U2.  Go buy an iPod\\", further suggested by their first appearance in a commercial for the aforementioned product.  Hey, I guess they gotta eat ... those poor saps.  Maybe we should take up a donation for these guys: Feed U2, everybody!  <br /> <br />Believe it or not, it gets worse.  \\"Miracle Drug\\" has perhaps the worst line in a U2 song ever: \\"Freedom has a scent / Like the smell of a newborn baby's head\\"!  Kind of makes that \\"A mole / Digging in a hole\\" line from ATYCLB's \\"Elevation\\" seem profound by comparison.  The rest of the album ranges from the banal and derivative (\\"A Man And A Woman\\", \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\"), the tried and true (\\"City Of Blinding Lights\\", a song about - you guessed it - New York!), and overtly religious songs (\\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"Yahweh\\", both nowhere near as powerful and well-written as previous efforts on the same topic.  And then there's the sappy cringe-inducing \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", a blatant bid for airplay on soft rock stations.  Songs about losing a loved one are fine, but when it's this maudlin and trite, that's just a shame.  Musically, with the exception of \\"Vertigo\\", the album is pretty much the same bland soft rock that they performed on ATYCLB - nothing that really deviates from the formula whatsoever. <br /> <br />In summary: We've got songs about religion, New York, and losing a loved one, and plenty of crowd-pleasing soft rock - that's right, U2 just completely copied the template of their previous album, right down to the long-winded title.  They really dropped a \\"bomb\\" on all of us and prove that they are now just a nostalgia act that's in it for the money.  Music like this makes me feel guilty for even supporting these guys in the first place, now that their true intentions have come out.  A total lack of effort, songs that are dull and derivative, and inane lyrics make this an album to avoid.  Bono was once quoted as saying something along these lines: \\"If we release two consecutive bad albums, we'll quit\\".  Here's hoping he's a man of his word.
0141439807|4.0|Give Jane Austen credit for not recycling heroines: Fanny Price, the shy, wallflower-ish protagonist of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" is the complete opposite of her counterpart, the outgoing and self-confident Emma Woodhouse, in Austen's later novel.  Given her innocence and purity, it is not difficult to guess from the outset that, no matter what obstacles are thrust in her way, Fanny will ultimately triumph and enjoy the Austenian reward for personal virtue, a blissful marriage.<br /><br />Fanny, a little girl from a poor family, is invited to live with her wealthy uncle and aunt, the Bertrams, and grow up with her cousins at their estate which gives the novel its title.  Her reticence and plainness immediately alienate her from her socially active and radiant cousins Maria and Julia, and she shows no special mental aptitude, as her other aunt, Mrs. Norris, a parson's widow who now lives at Mansfield Park, smugly notices.  Fortunately, her cousin Edmund, who is studying to be a clergyman, is sympathetic to her and tries to make her feel like one of the family.<br /><br />A brother and sister, Henry and Mary Crawford, enter and catalyze the plot as they quickly befriend the Bertrams.  Cheerful, carefree, and irresponsible, Henry flirts egregiously with the Bertram girls, even though Maria is engaged to marry a rich young man named Rushworth.  Mary, a talented harpist, is far from angelic--she is tactless, irreverent, scheming, and selfish, but she wears it all with a bright smile.  Deriding the presence of a chapel in a private home, she is sternly reproached by Edmund, to whom she has taken a liking and of whose vocational goal she was previously unaware; whereupon she pressures him to pursue instead the more lucrative and prestigious profession of law.<br /><br />After a ball in which Fanny sheds her ugly duckling feathers for those of a graceful swan, Henry casts his attention towards her and professes his love; but she spurns him, finding their personalities incompatible.She feels some guilt over this because Henry has helped her brother William get a promotion in the Navy; and her uncle Sir Thomas, stunned by her refusal and believing that Henry would make an honorable and desirable husband, tries to persuade her to accept.  The persistence of an unwanted suitor--a motif that recurs in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Emma\\"--must have struck Austen as an amusingly dire predicament for a young lady.<br /><br />The novel has an interesting antagonist in the form of Mrs. Norris, who thinks of Fanny as the redheaded stepchild in the otherwise beautiful Bertram household.  The humor in this situation is that everybody (except Fanny, who won't defend herself) is apparently oblivious to this woman's insidiousness, which allows her to go about spreading her sourness at will without fear of reproof.  Every time she opens her mouth, it is to disparage Fanny with some surreptitiously hurtful remark that backhandedly praises her pretty cousins.  One gets the sense that Austen was projecting somebody she particularly disliked into the character of Mrs. Norris.<br /><br />Like Austen's other major novels, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a grandly designed drama about the interrelationship of love, marriage, money, and society in nineteenth-century England, in this case with a likeable heroine who doesn't try to be cute and is perhaps a little too passive for her own good.  All the other Austen elements are in place, including her patented sarcasm and the happy ending which she justifies by \\"let[ting] other pens dwell on guilt and misery,\\" but regardless of predictability her expertise in constructing monumental fictions cannot be denied.
0679735909|5.0|This book tells the stories of the four main characters: Roland and Maud (in present times) and Christabel and Randolph (in the Victorian era). The author moves seamlessly back and forth between the two stories, weaving them together. The book is part mystery and part love story, and very hard to put down! I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone.
0060931671|5.0|I've heard of Pynchon of course, but had never experienced his work, until now.  Now I know the meaning of \\"Pynchonesque\\" and will never have to wonder again what it means.<br /><br />On the surface, the subject matter of this book is serious and bleak.  Conspiracies abound.  People die mysteriously.  Paranoia and hallucinations twist the mundane into knots.  Pynchon pulls the reader's leg with his genius, provokes thought processes beyond the superficial.  He does it gradually and sneakily -- with prose that varies from beautifully wrought to exasperating, characters named Mucho Maas and Fallopian, a radio station named KCUF, and more outrageous plot twists than mind can comprehend -- until I did not know whether to gasp, laugh, or cry by the last page.
B00005JKC3|1.0|What a complete piece of crap. This movie is just one big mess. I'll stick with watching the original tv show (w/ Bill Bixby)  and reading my old comics. Don't waste your time or money on this dredge. If you like comic books made into movies stick with X-Men and Spiderman, hell even Daredevil was ten times better than this train wreck. Oh well you get my point. Don't watch this movie!
B000777J2S|5.0|I was originally introduced to Antony and the Johnsons by way of a Current 93 album EP that included a track by Antony in 2000. Current 93's frontman David Tibet has a knack for finding and creating intimate relationships with strange and amazing artists including Tiny Tim, Shirley Collins and Jandek among several others.  Being ever-interested in the strange and rare I found  Antony and the Johnsons early tracks  to be strange and a very different.  I got the sense that this music was something very interesting yet I wasn't ready for it yet.  With the release of \\"I am a Bird Now\\", and its wide acclaim, I have had a chance to revisit Antony and Johnsons work and am totally amazed.   This album is intimate, and dream-like as Antony is able to bear his inner soul through one note creating an experience that is too real and fascinating to ignore.  \\"I am a Bird Now\\" is a great and artistic album that is instantly enveloping and altogether magnificent.    Opening up with \\"Hope There's someone\\" with its falsetto sung lyrics and soulful piano and bass we are instantly presented with a sound that is both introspective and uplifting.  Antony's voice is an anomaly: it seems to be something otherworldly as it hovers between the masculine and the feminine but it is artful and extraordinary. The tracks go on with greatness, and then comes \\"You are my Sister\\" featuring Boy George.  Wow, this is track is amazing and just indicative of the album as a whole.      Overall, this is a great album that is spiritual and fantastic.  With artists of the caliber of Lou Reed making appearances on this album all signs point to the greatness of this band and its future.  Get this album and you'll see what I mean.  It is something that works cant fully describe.  This is sure to be one of the best albums of 2005.  You dont want to be the left in there...     --Ted Murena
B0007O38F8|5.0|I love the whole CD.  bought it in stores as soon as it came out and was glad I did, it was well worth it.
B00005JMUL|3.0|This probably would've been a better movie if done with real live actors. The characters looked weird and some of them even scary, there was no life to their faces and eyes, I just couldn't really connect with anything. <br /> <br />And the dancing waiters? FREAKY haha <br /> <br />Half way through the movie I was sitting there wondering what was the point, it's a kid on a train getting himself into problems, some problems didn't even make sense. The plot was weak...BUT towards the end it got a little better. The action scenes were pretty good, those helped the movie a lot. <br /> <br />Overall I enjoyed the movie more towards the end.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I just want to start out by saying that Mel gibson is a genius, I mean he took a risk funding this movie with 30 million dollars, but it payed off big time. lets be honest here this guy really knows how to put a quality flick on screen, Braveheart, Man without a Face, and Now the Passion. I'm just mentioning the movies he directed not including the movies he starred in, I could go on forever with those movies. Anyway I have to admit I was blown away on how realistic the Passion was.  Everything is accurate right down to the nitty gritty. Sure it is graphic but were talking thousands of years ago, people were ruthless back then. There are no tricks or twists, Mel Gibson keeps it very organized and gets to the point. The music and acting is stunning I give much respect to Jim Caveizel he did a great job along with his mother Mary and Pontius Pilot. At first I was hesitate of the Hebrew subtitles, but Mel Gibson does a great job of keeping the dialogue very simple. Also The strong emotional scenes kind of speaks for itself so I guess you really don't need much dialogue. I am also glad how Mel Gibson basically screwed Hollywood, I mean obviously he wasn't going to win any Academy Awards because of the subject matter not to mention like 80% of Hollywood is Jewish. but since this movie  was going to bring an anti-semitic wave which it DIDN'T I might add it couldn't get one academy award, Ridiculous! But it is great to see this master piece gross over 700 Million dollars, he basically shut the academy awards up with that. Besides that, the dvd is great too, although no special features are included which I'm not surprised at either, the movie speaks for itself. I personally would rather have a better quality movie with no special feaures than a 4-disc set with an awful picture. The quality is amazing though. This movie probably is one the highest quality looking movies ever. The sound which is in DTS. 5.1 hebrew aramic surround sound is stunning, all of my speakers get attention. The transfer is very clean with bright colors. This movie is deff. worth checking out, its accurate, emotional, and very powerful. I also suggest you buy the Mel Gibson interview with Diane Sawyer, well worth it if you want to see Mel Gibson defend his movie and make Diane Sawyer look like an idiot!!!ention. The transfer is very clean with bright colors. This movie is deff. worth checking out, its accurate, emotional, and very powerful.

1592400876|4.0|\\"Sticklers Unite!\\" is the rallying call of author Lynne Truss, who appeals to like-minded readers to share her outrage.  If you've ever seen a misplaced apostrophe to indicate a plural (e.g., \\"Book's for Sale\\") and have wanted to scream, this book is definitely for you!  The entire style of the book is over-the-top, thus it is intended solely for those who feel quite strongly about punctuation issues.  In author Frank McCourt's forward, he refers to Lynne Truss's \\"bone-dry humor,\\" and there is definitely plenty of that; \\"bone-dry sarcasm\\" might even be more appropriate, as Truss compares those who notice punctuation gaffes to the little boy from the movie THE SIXTH SENSE who could see dead people (and don't forget, he sees them \\"ALL THE TIME\\").<br /><br />As far as her actual recommendations go, I found Truss's rules and guidelines to be pretty consistent with what I learned both in school and during brief stints as writing and grammar tutors.  One point of confusion arises from the fact that Truss is British:  unfortunately, the British and American systems of punctuation do not always coincide.  In particular, after reading the section on use of punctuation with quotation marks, I remained perplexed about exactly what was appropriate here in the US.  Overall, however, I found this book to be not only an amusing read but also a validating one, perfect for a stickler like myself.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|I've been a fan of Josh Homme since his days as the guitarist for Kyuss. I had the pleasure of seeing Queens at a hole in the wall tavern in Sacramento CA for the release of their first album.  It was one of the best shows I've ever seen and I've been a devoted fan since.  This band is amazing.  It is the defining sound of what rock n roll should be.  Listening to this record makes me feel like it is ok that I missed the legends such as zeppelin,the doors, black sabbath, and the kinks.  Josh and QOTSA have become a modern day rock giant for all to enjoy.  Do yourself a favor and buy this record and listen to it as loud as you possibly can.

B000002OZY|5.0|This album stood the music world on end. It changed the way we viewed rock-n-roll almost to the same extent that The Beatles' album \\"Sgt Pepper\\" did. \\"Tommy\\" was the ultimate concept album in that it is a fully integrated piece of music which tells a single story. \\"Tommy\\" showed that a two disc rock album could be used to tell an operatic style story.<br /><br />The Story: Interestingly, the author, Pete Townsend, admits that he was unsure exactly what the story was until the movie was made of the \\"opera!\\" The basic story is of \\"Tommy,\\" who was born while his father, \\"Captain Walker,\\" is away at sea. Captain Walker returns home after several years absence and discovers Tommy's mother with her new lover. Tommy's mother and her lover kill Tommy's father in front of the young Tommy. Although left vague, Tommy may have been beaten to keep him quiet. At a minimum, he was forcefully admonished not to let anyone know about the killing. The mother and lover sing \\"You never heard it! You never saw it! You'll never tell a soul what you know is the truth!\\"  At the same time, Tommy sings at a nearly inaudible level, \\"I heard it, I saw it ...\\" but complies by adding, \\"I'll never tell a soul what I know is the truth.\\"  The psychological trauma from the incident caused Tommy to comply by becomming deaf, dumb and blind so he could never reveal what he knew, or anything else, leaving him alone with his thoughts and feelings.  The only contact he is able to have with the world is with a pinball machine.<br /><br />Thereafter, Tommy is put through physical, sexual and psychological abuse by his family. (His uncle rapes him, his cousin tortures him, and his family take him to the Acid Queen in a failed attempt to break Tommy out of his sightless and soundless state.) Because he is cut off from sight, sound and communication, he is able to have some sort of spiritual contact with the universe which others are unable to experience. -- \\"Strange as it seems, his musical dreams ain't quite so bad.\\" \\"Simpleness will surely take the mind where minds can't usually go.\\"<br /><br />But, despite his lack of sight and hearing, he becomes a pinball wizzard and a celebrity. When his senses are returned, he is hailed as a messiah. But, as with all messiahs, the masses eventually rejected him because his path to spiritual enlightenment is too difficult to follow. In the end, he was as alone as he had been without his sight, hearing and speech.<br /><br />The work is on several levels, the first of which is described above.  On a second level, Tommy is representative of the entire post World War II baby boomer generation, and how the \\"younger generation\\" (rightfully) felt it was being raped by the older generation.  This was one of the great themes of the \\"younger generation\\" in the mid to late '60s, as they were being shipped off to an unpopular and nearly endless war in Viet Nam to protect the United States' oil interests.  Those heros who served in the war came home physically and psychologically maimed, and in many instances addicted to heroine, alcohol and marijuana, marching to a differnt music than when they left, to a world where they were not given a hero's welcome, but, like Tommy, were rejected, mistreated and alone.<br /><br />The Music: Tommy was the first \\"rock opera.\\" (OK, Pete Townsend will tell you that \\"Tommy\\" it is a song cycle, whatever that is! -- and a later reviewer corrected me that Pretty Thing's operatic \\"S. F. Sorrow\\" came a year earlier.) It is complete with an overture and an underture.  The Who wanted to be able to perform it live, so an orchestra was not brought into the studio. Townsend and producer Kit Lambert added in all kinds of queues from classical music, such as the occasional use of a French Horn, trumpet and flugelhorn, and extended instrumental passages. Producer Kit Lambert worked hard to make a four piece rock band sound like an orchestra! But, this album is not one of the middle of the road pop rock operas which were to follow such as Jesus Christ Superstar or Evita.  This was the Who.  At the time, they were the loudest rock band around with something like 125,000 watts of power.  This is still the Who which performed Live at Leeds, The Who Sell Out, and Who's Next.<br /><br />Many of the songs became hits, including \\"Pinball Wizzard,\\" \\"See Me, Feel Me,\\" and \\"The Acid Queen.\\" Personally, I prefer the extended musical sections as they are more challenging and satisfying passages.<br /><br />And Keith (how the hell did he do it!?!) Moon was brilliant on drums.<br /><br />If you have an SACD or DVD Audio player, I highly recommend buying this album in those formats.  If not, and you have any sort of decent sound system, Pioneer makes a cheap unit which plays both.<br /><br />Enjoy!ar or Evita.  This was the Who.

B00004RIVF|5.0|I use to have this cassette back in back in high school (during the 80's). Some jerk off stole a bunch of my cassettes out of my car, so i didn't hear this band for almost 15 years. I finally got the reissue on cd a couple of weeks ago and it is awsome! It still rocks. I don't know why these guys didn't do any better then they did? All i know is that if you are into 80's thrash or thrash period, you need to check out this band.<br /><br />They won't disappoint. Check out the cover of Sweet's \\"Set Me Free\\".<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00025ETIW|5.0|this album is amazing. i had heard a few of there songs from their first album, and was pretty interested, then i got their second album and i was blown away. it has been a while since a great band like this has come alone. and for all you people saying MCR is for whiney little emo high schoolers.. your soo wrong.. just because you dont like it doesnt mean its just for whiney emo high schoolers. im not \\"emo\\" and i love it. if you like the used, eighteen visions or funeral for a friend.. you might like them, and if not.. you must be stupid.

0060234814|5.0|Recently, I started reading `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' by C.S Lewis and I didn't notice the time fly by, as I was completely absorbed in the story. <br /> <br />This story talks about 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy, who have just moved into a professor's home in the country. They are fascinated with the mansion that they move in to, and decide to do some exploring inside. In one of the rooms, they notice an old Wardrobe, and everyone except Lucy move on to the other rooms. Lucy, being most inquisitive, decides to open the wardrobe and step inside, not knowing that she is entering another world. Seeing all the wonderment of the mew world and meeting a new friend, she comes back to tell the others. Initially, they don't believe her, but once day, they all enter the wardrobe and into the World of Narnia. However, Mr. Tumnus, Lucy's friend has been made a prisoner by the evil witch of Narnia and it is up to the children to save Mr. Tumnus and make the land a happy place again.  <br /> <br />This was a delightful book to read. The simple language will make both adults and children enjoy the story. You get to meet interesting characters like Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Mr. Tumnus, the witch, and of course Aslan, the all-powerful lion and protector of Narnia. You meet the good and the bad, and get to see who wins the final battle between the two. <br /> <br />This book has comedy, adventure, battles, sorcery and much more that will keep you interested throughout! A wonderful read! <br />
B0006213WG|1.0|When Sum 41 kicked off their careers with the albums, \\"Half Hour of Power\\" and \\"All Killer No Filler\\" I thought that they would be easily the next big thing. Since \\"Does this look infected?\\" however, I've changed my mind. Chuck is quite possibly one of the worst albums ever released by a pop punk band. Where most songs are not even close to technically appealing, most are downright bad. For instance, the song, \\"Pieces\\" is simply a ripoff with even the same chord progression format as Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\". Sum 41 either needs to get original or get out because another album like this and I will lose all faith in the bands that the modern music industry is promoting.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|I recommend this Everwood DVD to everyone.  Everwood is the type of show that every member of the family can enjoy.  Its quirky characters and smart one-liners keep the laughs coming.  Everwood also addresses some serious issues that people of all ages face.  Everwood is one of the best and most under-recognized shows on todays television.

B00000JMQE|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about six years old.  I couldn't sleep, and my mom hid the tape so I wouldn't be freaked out again.  I found it when I was fourteen and watched it, and I thought it was an odd movie but I loved it.  It was great and I watched it over and over again.  Untill one day I turned it on and my brother had taped over it with some other stupid movie.  So needless to say I bought the dvd.  I highly recommend doing the same thing.  Whether or not your evil brother taped over your original copy.
0671004107|3.0|When I saw the film I felt there was a lot left out. The film's narrative seemed disjointed and rushed. The book while it does fill in some of those glossed in details has its own pacing problems. After spending pages and pages explaining why something can't be done, this road block is suddenly gone. Then there's the ultimate \\"trip\\" to Vega is just as disappointing in the book (though certainly more coherent than the cinematic version).
B00006RAKP|4.0|Since Amazon offers it, BUY THE UK VERSION. This has a nice pasket with all the album covers and a short history of Elton John. It also includes his great songs but the UK version has all these and more including his John Lennon tributes hey Hey Johnny (Empty Garden), his Beatles cover number 1 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and his great rocker version of the Pinball Wizard. Still, you can't go wrong with anything on the first disc of this version. The quality on the 2nd disc reflects some of his creative slumps. Anyhow this is a great album but if you can, get the other one. It also has is live Recording and Diani versions of Candle in the Wind.
0446677450|3.0|This books is not nearly as helpful as one may hope.  We come away learning that the author is rich and successful and knows how to make money.  While he claims not to be tooting his own horn, her certainly does a lot of it.  No, this book does not tell you how to become rich.  What it does do is convey the mindset of someone who wants to become rich.  Despite being horribly written, it is an interesting read.  Note that Kiyosaki knows how to make money, so he knows how to market and sell books.  In other words, by buying this book you are making him rich.  That being said, it is marginally interesting.   <br /> <br />Education is never a bad thing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Alright, first things first, if i hear \\"OH MY GOD, GREEN DAY IS THE BEST BAND EVER, BUY THIS CD, I LOVE Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" I am going to flip out, and smack someone in the face. You are making the rest of us who actually like the WHOLE CD look bad.    Now, I am going to restate a few things that people before me have said, just because some of you are unable to comprehend them. Green Day has MATURED. Say it with me. M-A-T-U-R-E-D. Their songs and sound are obviously different from Dookie. Not that Dookie isnt a bad CD, its f'ing great, but who wants to hear another Dookie/Dookie sounding CD? If I wanted that, I would have not have bothered with this CD and just would be listening to Dookie. Yes, Green Day has grown up, MATURED. You really cant compare this with Dookie, its been over 10 years, things have changed.    Also, I am sick of the bashing of an honestly good CD, because ONE of the songs is \\"TOO MAINSTREAM\\". That generally is what happens when its good. And Ill admit, I am completely against the playing this song and grinding it into the dirt. But thats no reason to completely bash a perfectly good song or CD. And heaven forbid the songs increase the popularity of the CD, giving it recognization (*cough*grammy*cough)    Another thing that annoys me, people who are just looking at one or two songs (i.e. a few people whos reviews consist of I LOVE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS, or THE SONG AMERICAN IDIOT ROX! ^-^) I like the songs too, but picking one song is like picking your favorite chapter out of a book. The CD tells a story, and you have to recognize that. Whether you like or dislike the song, it all holds to a greater purpose, telling the story of Jesus, Jimmy, and Whatsername.    So Green Day has matured. You cant fault them for changing over a decade. And you cant fault them for the radios replaying songs until you get a twitch everytime you hear it. Just enjoy the CD for what it is, a good story and huge step forward.
1594200440|4.0|I picked up Marina Lewycka's \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" almost by accident.  The title attracted my attention so I picked it up and began reading.  After reading the first three sentences, I was sold. They are: \\"Two years after my mother died, my father fell in love with a glamorous blond Ukrainian divorcee.  He was eighty-four and she was thirty-six.  She exploded into our lives like a fluffy pink grenade, churning up the murky water, bringing to the surface sludge of sloughed-off memories, giving the family ghosts a kick up the backside.\\"  The concern I have with books that begin so well is the difficulty the remainder has in living up to such promise.  I am happy to report that Ukrainian Tractors lived up to the promise of its opening paragraph.  The opening sentences sum up the story.  Nikolai, his wife and two children Vera and Nadezhda (Nadia) were Ukrainian refugees who, at the conclusion of the Second World War make their way to Peterborough, England.  Vera was born before the war and has memories of the families' travails in German work camps.  She is the \\"war baby.\\" Vera is the basic domineering know-it-all older sister.  Nadia is the peace baby, a liberal sociology lecturer with a penchant for buying her clothes used at the local Oxfam (charity outlet).  Nadia and Vera have not talked since their mother's funeral.  Nikolai picks up he phone one day and announces to Nadia that he is about to take a new bride.  Valentina is a young, buxom bottle-blonde Ukrainian whose U.K. residency visa is about to expire.  As expected, Vera and Nadia call a truce in order to prevent the marriage and protect their father from a fate they consider worse than death.  Nikolai, of course, cannot help but contemplate blissful evenings in the warm embrace of his well-endowed faux-blonde soon to be illegal alien while he writes his book, a history of the tractor, the farm implement that changed the world.  Valentina makes for a worthy adversary and seems to best Vera and Nadia every step of the way.  The comedy of the book turns a bit dark, however, as Nikolai's age and infirmities facilitate Valentina's increasing dominance over him.  Her mental and physical abuse of Nikolai becomes apparent.  At the same time, Lewycka takes us on a trip through the family's past.  In the meantime, family ghosts and secrets begin to emerge.  Root causes of the family's deep-rooted antagonism begin to reveal themselves as the story progresses.  Events race on to a not altogether surprising conclusion.    I very much enjoyed \\"A Short History of tractors In Ukrainian\\".  I was impressed by the manner in which Lewycka fleshed out the characters.  Anyone who has been responsible for the care and feeding of an aging parent or grandparent will recognize Nikolai.  One's pride is the last thing to go sometimes and when we see events beat the pride out of our loved ones we can almost see them shrink before our eyes.  The two sisters also had a strong air of reality about them.  I've seen each type in real life and I think Lewycka captures their essences well.  Last but not least we have the Ukrainian bombshell, Valentina.  By the end of the book I had no small amount of sympathy for Valentina. I could admire her work effort and her desire to make a better life for herself and her son despite her poor treatment of Nikolai.  This is no easy task for a writer to accomplish.  At the same time, her grasping nature, her dolled-up appearance, and her belief that ready-made food products were the western equivalent of high cuisine were downright hilarious at times.  There were a couple of spots where I thought the story dragged a bit or where some of the actions of the characters did not quite ring true. Some of the subsidiary characters seems a bit lifeless compared to Valentina and Nikolai. However, those relatively minor flaws were swept up in a story that was both charming and thoughtful.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|As much as I didn't want to like this film, I loved it. <br />Will Smith is Handsome, Gorgeous, and any other adjective you can come up with to describe fine!!! His acting was excellent and his costars were great. I can't wait for the DVD to come out, it's one I will buy for sure.
0142000663|4.0|I enjoyed this book up until the last few chapters. The death of the baby and nursing of the sick man was just too much for me. It was too melodramatic and overdone. Up until the disappointing and forced ending I relished in the descriptions of the drive across the country to California during the Depression and life in the migrant farms.
B000002HHB|5.0|This Album has me in tears, bobbing my head, and chuckling to myself at her sinister comments. Its all wrapped into a beautiful array of beats and melodies, piano, bongos, fantastic guitar and, of course, lets never forget Natalie's unforced and dementioned vocals. She does not need to try, she simply sings, and thats why these songs flow so well. She carries her band, and the band carries her - they do not break rythem, they do not break the flow - and its simply magnificent. I've liked Natalie Merchant for as long as I can remember, I was maybe 9-10 years old when I heard her sweet melody. I wish we had more real, naturally beautiful, and obviously beyond intelligent singers now a days, as Natalie carries her self with such grace and poise. Unfortunatly, for some odd reason, sex appeal and selling out is mainly what main stream media is all about, and it was clear that Natalie stayed true to her theme. Within Tigerlily, there is an emotion that is almost unexplainable. Its soothing, its disturbing - its uplifting and its depressing. Its sort of an elixer of what you might not expect out of an album. But I'm telling you, its pure magic. If you've heard 10,000 Maniacs and you liked what you heard, Natalie's solo albums, specifically Tigerlily, will blow your mind and soften your heart. And I read in another review that the lead guitar is a woman. Wow. That is so increadable. I wish I could play guitar. My twin brother does and has for years and I have know a few female players but she is just amazing. I'll remember now NOT the picture a man when she goes into that unbelievable solo in \\"Carnival\\".

This girl is more manufacted then Briteny Spears. <br /> <br />I songwriting team called the Matrix wrote the majority of Avril last album and made her who she is today.  Without htem she is a nothing. <br /> <br />It is funny how that same production crew callled the Matrix, went on to work with two artist that Avril hates the most, Britney Spears and Hilary Duff.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I, unlike a few reviewers on this site, loved Maiden throughout the 2 Bayley albums. In my opinion, as long as they have Steve Harris and Dave Murray in the band, they are maiden...anyway on the with the review... <br /> <br />Bruce Dickinson reunites with the band in Brave New World and folks what we have here is a reunion album like no other. While other bands may reunite for financial/fame reasons, Maiden's BNW album sounds just like any of their great stuff from the 80's. They're sound is not changed and comprimised like other bands today that reunite. This album is kick a$$ from start to finish. Key cuts include: Blood Brothers, The mercenary, the nomad.  <br /> <br />If your a new or aged Maiden fan, don't miss this one!
B0006J28BO|5.0|What can I say about \\"The Cat Returns\\", other than that it is a very well thought out, fun and a imaginative movie? It's hard to say. This movie definitely is one of Studio Ghibli's best, for it's wit and humor.  <br /> <br />The Disney English dub sees to it that you're not dissapointed, with an excellent voice casting, with the likes of Anne Hathaway, Cary Elwes, Peter Boyle, Tim Curry and Elliott Gould. Each of them brings fun and charm to their characters, sounding like they had fun in the process. The characters themesleves are awesome, Baron being the coolest out of them all in this feature. They're all so charming that they're hard not to like.  <br /> <br />If you love Kiki's Delivery Service (like I do) you'll love this little underappreciated gem. A great addition to your DVD library.
B000057NVH|5.0|When I think of albums which have retained their popularity over the years, two come to mind. Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is one; \\"Tubular Bells\\" is the other. And the fact that both have been released on hybrid SACD attests to their popularity. In the case of \\"Tubular Bells\\", this was not the first quad mix of the album to be released. The first, which was released as a CD-4 \\"Quadradisc\\" in the US, and as both SQ and QS in most of the rest of the world, pretty much mimicked the stereo version, except for the slow fade-in of the beginning and a few music-spins-around-you effects. The mix on this SACD features one that was originally created to convince Mike Oldfield to allow this recording to be released in multichannel. In addition, the original stereo mix is included on both the CD layer and the SACD stereo track. The 4.0 mix on the SACD multichannel track is cleaner and less cluttered sounding than that first released quad mix, and is more straight-forward. This mix was also released as a quad LP as part of a box set (now available on CD, and despite claims to the contrary, is the SQ version). That set, \\"Mike Oldfield Boxed\\", is worth seeking out. It also includes quad mixes of \\"Ommadawn\\", \\"Hergest Ridge\\", and \\"Collaborations\\".Now, if only they could release this box set in SACD... I digress. I highly recommend this SACD for those who want to hear what this system can do, and for MO fans, to finally hear everything he wanted you to hear.

I remembered how much I loved it and I picked it up. I am now 17 and I fell in love with this film all over again. This movie is so cool and yes it is very dumb but it is a popcorn flim what do you expect. Oh and by the way anyone expecting a good, deep, meaningful film is an idiot! The movie is about a giant mutant lizard attacking New York City what do you expect!!! Well overall this movie is a lot of fun and the best $5 I had ever spent!
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is the sequel to the popular Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) that conveys Bridget Jones' (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary.  This time the audience is introduced to her new diary, which opens with the happiness and joy that Bridget experiences through her love life.  Everything seems to be perfect, as her boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a human rights lawyer, provides the most delicious escapades in the bedroom, at least according to Bridget, who willingly shares this with her diary and people she meets.  This sharing of secrets becomes a little repetitive as the film moves along.<br /><br />Preoccupation with obsessive dreaming of Mark affects her life, as she thoughtlessly steps into trouble and embarrassment.  This embarrassment further increases her already strong insecurities.  Insecurity then leads to situations where she begins to question Mark's honesty, loyalty, and love for her through assumptions that she makes based on information inflamed with jealousy.  She could be a poster child for insecurity, as she continuously questions Mark's integrity and in the end only hurts herself.<br /><br />In the middle of her predicaments regarding her relationship with Mark she once again meets the sly womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is the anchor for a TV travel program called \\"The Smooth Guide.\\"  The TV station that Bridget works for wants to make the program more accessible for a wider audience and suggests that she becomes a co-host on \\"The Smooth Guide.\\"  Initially Bridget refuses, but as expected, she gives in.  Their first episode together is to be shot in Thailand, and Bridget brings one of her friends to help chaperone her.<br /><br />When they arrive in Thailand Daniel turns up his charm and tries to sway Bridget to give him a second chance, however, Bridget is cautious as she was once hurt before.  This happens while Bridget's friend hooks up with a younger man who asks her to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.  The naïve Bridget thinks she is going to be helpful, but she has evidently never seen Bangkok Hilton (1989), Return to Paradise (1998), and Brokedown Palace (1999), which would make her a lot more cautious.  Just as in these other films there are drugs in the item that she is to bring to England, and she is sent to a Thai prison.  Who could help her get out of prison?  Well, that might not be a surprise to the audience, as they will see this film unfold.<br /><br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason delivers a cinematic experience full of obvious stereotypes that are turned into slapstick moments.  Furthermore, the film attempts to make fun of Bridget's lack of knowledge and insecurities, which occasionally work, but frequently lead into awkward and confusing moments where the audience does not know whether to feel sorry for Bridget or to laugh at her.  As if it was not enough, the film uses clich&eacute;s that have been seen in similar films many times before throughout several decades, and this enhances the predictability of the story.  Ultimately, this sequel falls way short of the accomplishments made in the initial film.<br /><br />As mentioned, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason falls short compared to the first film, yet the film has its funny moments.  Those who are Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fans might want to see this film, as her performance is actually remarkable.  However, overall this film is only a mediocre romantic comedy that is worth renting on an evening when the audience feels that they need to put things in perspective in regards to relationships and love.to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.

B000002U82|5.0|This album is a brilliant concept album! If you are into trippy psychedelic music, then you will love this. It is cool how the songs connect with each other. Dark Side Of The Moon is a must listen from start to finish. My reviews of the songs are: <br /> <br />1. Speak To Me <br /> <br />   Breathe 10/10 <br />Brilliant way to start the album. I love the slide guitar in the intro. It is cool how the album starts with the beating of the heart, while you hear cash registers and insane laughter (which happen later in the album) <br /> <br />2. On The Run 8/10 <br />It is a cool little instrumental between songs. I think it is neccasary to have it because it brings you through many different moods before you get to the next song. <br /> <br />3. Time 10/10 <br />It is my favorite on this album. The water dripping, and the clocks ringing is definitely a really cool way to start the song. I love the long intro, and the cool guitar solo. <br /> <br />4. The Great Gig In The Sky 10/10 <br />I love the piano, and Claire Torry wailing throughout the song. It is brilliant. <br /> <br />5. Money 9.5/10 <br />The most commercial song on the album. It has a cool bassline, and has the cash register noises to act as part of the percussion. The guitar solo is cool. <br /> <br />6. Us And Them 8/10 <br />This ong is alright. <br /> <br />7. Any Colour You Like 8.5/10 <br />This song is cool, The guitar parts are awesome. <br /> <br />8. Brain Damage 9.5/10 <br />This song is brilliant. Lots of things I could say about it, but I just don't feel like it. <br /> <br />9. Eclipse 10/10 <br />I love this song. Brilliant way to close the album. Very Climactic. I love how the song ends the way the album started. <br /> <br />This a brilliant album. Roger Waters is the brains behind Pink Floyd. (Not Syd Barrett) This a classic album, and always will be.
B0000024ZC|4.0|This is Gentle Giant's third album.  It was released with a different cover in Europe than in the US. In Europe, it had a sort of abstract outline of three boys.  In the US, the cover for Gentle Giant's first album was used.  This is bad, because the backside cover includes a drawing of the members of the band from the first album, and the drummer had changed.  (The first Gentle Giant LP was never released in the US).  I think that the record company exec's that thought of that one had their heads up their rears.  I think the original, European cover of Three Friends is much more inviting an would sell more records.    Most Gentle Giant albums have a number of different CD releases with differening sound quality.  I know of two different CD releases for Three Friends.  The one sold here is from Sony (Columbia Records).  The sound quality is very muddy when compared to the LP.  There is supposed to be another version from Line records in Germany that has much better sound quality.  You can get more details on the sound quality Gentle Giant CD's at Blazemonger.  But, I can vouch for the poor quality of the Sony release, as I have a copy and compared it to my LP.    This is not really a five star CD.  Like most Gentle Giant albums, it is very short.  It is only 35 minutes long.  For a CD that is that short to rate 5 stars, all songs must be fantastic.    This CD has some great songs on it. I really like Peel The Paint; it really rocks.  Working All Day is also very good and rememiscent of the second album (Acquring the Taste).  Mister Taste and Quality is a nice jazzy tune.  But, the opening and closing songs that set the stage, are not really that interesting.  They are only songs to let you know what the album is about (about 3 childhood friends that grow up and take different paths in life).    I think that Acquiring the Taste and Octopus are better albums.    A couple of notes about the some other reviews and reviews in general.  A number of people called this an underrated CD.  This is a cliche often used.  Who under rated it and what was the low rating they gave it?  Not too many people have heard of Gentle Giant, and the group rarely go mentioned in the press.  They may be unknown to many and may be unrated, but they are aren't \\"underrated\\" or \\"unappreciated\\".   The other thing to note is that some reviewers give 5 stars to everything.  Giving 5 stars to everything makes your reviews popular and gets you a high rating as a reviewer.  In Amazon, most people do not look up reviews to help them decide to buy something.  They go look at things they love and see if others agree with them.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I was a stickler to the old cartoon, Warriors of the Wind. Despite it's dubbing back then, which was not very good, I grew up with it and loved it. <br />Then I got the graphic novels, and found out how much was cut from this movie. <br />I got this movie locally. And it was redubbed wonderfully. Never did I know Patrick Stewart (Picard on STTNG) Would turn out to be the perfect Lord Yupa, as apposed to the original voice. <br />I discovered at least 30 minutes had been cut from this movie in the dubbing of Warriors of the Wind. Which left more gaps than many would have realized. <br />Disney also went back to the original Japanese names. Which I loved. They kept the same score as you would hear from the older version. I loved the one line they kept from the old dubbing. \\"That's Lord Yupa! Kill him and you'll be famous!\\" ^_^ <br />If you want the complete version, get this movie. You won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't! ^_^
6301976622|5.0|I checked this movie out of the library, watched it once, and immediately ordered my own copy. Like _All About Eve_, _Bringing Up Baby_, _Casablanca_ and _Double Indemnity_, this is a film I will be watching over and over. Excellent actors, consummate attention to historical detail, lavish sets, fine choreography and beautiful costuming all add to the viewing pleasure.  <br /> <br />Yes, you'll be watching a fabulous spectacle depicting the plight of early Christians during the reign of the Emperor Nero. But it is the script of _Quo Vadis_ that makes the film rank high in my list of perfect movies. Clever and multi-layered, the dialogue encourages us to explore our own attitudes towards madness, faith, and sense of duty by listening in on the conversations of such varied characters as the Apostles Peter and Paul, a cast-off mistress of Nero, a Roman Senator and a Greek soothsayer.  <br /> <br />But, ultimately, the lion's share (oops, couldn't help that little pun!) of the cast is involved in a discovery of what it is to love and be loved. We encounter a slave desperately in love with her indifferent master; an emperor who longs for the approval of his people, even while despising them; a young foreigner torn between her earthly love for a handsome Roman officer and her spiritual longing for the Word of God; a slave who will kill to protect his mistress even though he believes killing is a sin;  and an advisor to the Emperor who finds that he must ultimately cast off his role of peacemaker and nursemaid to Nero if he is ever to gain self-respect.  <br /> <br />The dialogue is antique without being precious, literate without being pretentious. It does not feel at all self-conscious, as I have found to be the case with some costume dramas. It is not an impediment to enjoying the story; it is an enhancement. <br /> <br />Even the most polished script, however, will flounder without actors of the proper calibre and everyone in the cast is more than equal to the task athand.  To my mind, however, Peter Ustinov's performance as the petulant, insecure, outrageous Emperor Nero is nothing short of astonishing. Alarmingly manic one moment, Nero segues into a most royal, self-pitying sulk in a couple of breaths. Ustinov makes it believable, portraying the Emperor as a spoiled and frightened child who can react one moment with pure instinct and, the next, justify inexcusable crimes with clever and convoluted argument.  <br /> <br />Nero, who rationalizes \\"a man's acts may be cruel when he himself is not cruel,\\" will eventually burn Rome and kill scores of innocents in the arena. But throughout the first half of the movie, his worst tendencies are held in check by his friend and advisor Petronious, a nobleman who describes himself as \\"indestructible.\\" Petronious, portrayed with masterful irony by Leo Genn, relies on his quick wits in order to stay alive and prosper in the reign of a madman, and takes a certain pride in his ability to keep Nero under control.  <br /> <br />Nero is always watching Petronius, seeing how he will react, trying to second-guess him. Petronius is the only person whose opinion Nero cares about, because he is the only one who is not a total sycophant. As a matter of fact, Petronius at times goes out of his way to say the total opposite of what would be politically expedient to say, then, amazingly, turn his comment around to prove that he is being loyal to Nero by being honest and plainspoken. For example, when Nero complains about how much he hates the people, that he wishes they had but a single head that he might chop it off, Petronius doesn't shame him or tell him he's crazy as a bedbug. That would hardly be effective. Instead, Petronius reminds Nero that the mob is necessary, for a ruler needs subjects and an artist needs an audience.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Rome, Nero has decided sing about a burning city, and he has come to the conclusion that he must experience the real thing in order to interpret it. Also unfortunately for Rome, Petronius, who has previously complained of never being able to discover \\"an honest warmth in any woman,\\" has been surprised by the love of his beautiful slave Eunice and is therefore distracted. There is no-one to talk Nero down, no-one to turn his immediate impulses into something less destructive. And when the stunned Petronius hears the news that Rome is aflame, he comments ironically, \\"Now, indeed, Nero has his place in history.\\"  <br /> <br />Indeed, Petronius is able to keep his sense of the ironic until he witnesses the terrified Romans fleeing in desperation into the hitherto forbidden neighbourhoods of the wealthy. Nero exclaims in disgust, \\"Is it possible that human beings can produce such a sound?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Yes,\\" relies Petronius, doubtless speaking for himself as well as the terrified mob, \\"when they have been driven too far.\\" And, when Nero eyes the nobleman askance, it is clear that Petronius has lost major brownie points by going too far himself. Sensing a hated rival's almost instantaneous loss of status, Nero's empress suggests that perhaps Petronius himself is one of the despised Christians. To Nero's point-blank question, Petronius responds levelly, \\"I am not. I have heard that the Christians teach you to love your neighbour. And, as I see what men are, I cannot for the life of me love my fellow men.\\" <br /> <br />After the destruction of Rome, Petronius finds it hard to harbour any affection even for himself. Ashamed that he did not address the frightened citizens and urge them to depose Nero, the Emperor's erstwhile advisor berates himself as nothing more than \\"an amused cynic, a selfish onlooker.\\"  <br /> <br />But this amused cynic will ultimately redeem himself, by signing \\"with humility\\" a letter which is being sent to General Galba, asking him to return to Rome and depose Nero. Then Petronius calls for his servant Alexander, saying \\"I will give him the names of those few I love.\\" Petronius has planned abanquet, \\"an evening of farewell.\\" With his few true friends as witness, Petronius reads aloud a letter he has written to Nero, in which he advises in closing, \\"Brutalize the people, but do not bore them, as you have bored to death your friend, the late Gaius Petronius.\\" His friends gasp. Petronius assures them, \\"it is not enough to live well; one must die well,\\" adding, \\"The Christians say that death is but a transition to a better life. It will be interesting to discover.\\" His physician has slit Petronius' wrist. He will die with honour, escaping execution at the hands of Nero, prompting one of his guests to eulogize, \\"With you perishes the best of our Roman world.\\" <br /> <br />When Nero hears of the death of his former friend, he dissolves in melodramatic weeping. Yet even in his grief, he must perform, shedding tears into his weeping vial (one for Petronius and one for himself) and wailing for his audience, \\"How I have loved you, Petronius.\\" He opens the letter, eager to read the last words addressed to him by his departed friend. But, as he scans the insulting, honest words, Nero comes to hate Petronius and everything associated with him, including Petronius' nephew Marcus and the Christian girl he loves and, consequently launch what he gloatingly describes as \\"a spectacle of terror.\\" Nero always has someone else to blame for his misdeeds. <br /> <br />But the slaughter of the Christians brings no satisfaction to the Emperor. The Christians sing as they go to their slaughter, inspiring the reluctantly impressed Marcus to snap, \\"These people know how to die, Nero. You will squeal like a hog.\\" Nero cannot understand how the Christians can sing as they are being killed. After the slaughter, he goes at night into the arena and is appalled to find that they are all smiling.  <br /> <br />All too soon, Marcus' predictions concerning Nero come true. The Empress has arranged for Ursus, the gigantic servant of Marcus' Lygia, to fight a fierce black bull. The mob turnsugly and the military revolts when the Emperor is foolish enough to give the thumbs-down to the victorious giant. Nero will meet his end dishonourably, and a new ruler will come to power, a sane one who has no need of either scapegoats or audiences.  <br /> <br />Satisfying from beginning to end, from the first viewing to the twentieth and beyond, _Quo Vadis_ is a treasure.  And if you want to appreciate it (and films of its ilk) even more, check out Jon Solomon's _The Ancient World in the Cinema_.  <br /> <br />A bit of trivia from the web: While a Lieutenant-Colonel in the British Army, Leo Genn was one of the Prosecuting Officers at the British-mounted 1945 Belsen War Crimes trial. Belsen, like the other concentration camps was established to hold what were considered, by the Nazi regime, as undesirable people, ranging from Jews to relatives of famous German citizens who had fled overseas. Notable inmates of Belsen include Marlene Dietrich's sister and the Dutch Jewish girl Anne Frank. Genn was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007OASII|5.0|Its time for another fantastic production from this group.  Khan's immaculate voice, the flawless production and mixing, the thoughtfull melodies, the varying landscape of moods and stories.    Yes, it is vintage Kamelot.  I could understand how fans of early albums might not love this, just like the past several records.  But this band keeps getting better and better.  As is often the case, when a musical group grows, stretches and experiments, folks complain.  Oh well.   If real music fans spend time with this collection, and get to know it, it is the best Kamelot so far.    Try and find something wrong with this collection.  I'm not sure who was more excited about a new Kamelot record, me or my 11 year old.  These guys keep delivering the goods.  Operatic vocals, sweeping scenery with orchestral passages, metallic sections with biting guitars, pounding drums and strange spoken interludes.      I had initially felt that it was too much in the mold of Epica, which was a logical growth from Karma, but after many listens,  my opinion has changed quite a bit.   It is much darker, more serious, more hard hitting.  The new guest players add to the scenery where necessary, and the clearly defined style of the core 4 in the band proper is still super crisp.  These guys know each other, and are pros.  Khan's vocals still blow me away, and I now believe he is at the top of this genre with Russell Allen.      If you are a rabid Kamelot fan (there are lots of us), then this is simply a must have.  If you are new to the band, try Karma first, then go backwards and forwards.   But Black Halo deserves the great reviews it is getting everywhere.  Kamelot is a team, a unified voice.  There is no showboating, no bombastic thrashing or angry growling (although there is some subtle growl here and there), no insane solos by egomaniacal guitarists trying to out thrash everyone.  Nope, this is as close to a melodic metal orchestral production team as you will find besides Symphony X, who tends to be more thrashy anyway (I love them).      This is a timeless band.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a great album! I have listened to it many times and I think it is brilliant. I should say that In Utero is a lot different from Nevermind though. In Utero is a lot less commercial, and has a much rawer, abrasive sound then Nevermind. <br />I think both albums are classic and deserve 5 stars. My reviews of the songs are: <br /> <br />1. Serve The Servants 9/10 <br />It is a really cool opener to the album, and has a catchy guitar riff in the verses. I love how you can hear the count-off before the song begins. <br /> <br />2. Scentless Aprentice 8.5/10 <br />This is a good song. There are lot more song that I like more though. <br /> <br />3. Heart Shaped Box 9.5/10 <br />This is a really well written song. It is about a lot of different things. It was the biggest single off this album. It is a Nirvana Classic. <br /> <br />4. Rape Me 9/10 <br />This is by far the most controversial song on this album, and probably the most controversial song in Nirvana's career. It is a decent song, with a good chorus. <br /> <br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle 10/10 <br />I think this is the most underrated song in the entire Nirvana discography. I love the clever lyrics in the verses, and I also love the quiet guitar part at the beginning of the song before it starts to rock. <br /> <br />6. Dumb 10/10 <br />This is a great song, with interesting lyrics. <br /> <br />7. Very Ape 8/10 <br />This song is pretty good, But it is one of my least favorites off this album. <br /> <br />8. Milk It 8.5/10 <br />This song is good. You can tell that Kurt was pretty angry when he wrote this one. <br /> <br />9. Pennyroyal Tea 10/10 <br />I absolutely love this song. The unplugged version is rad too. <br /> <br />10. Radiofriendly Unit Shifter 9.5/10 <br />This song is really good, and will always be a classic in my mind. <br /> <br />11. Tourette's 7/10 <br />This is my least favorite song here. It is pretty much just filler. (Even Kurt said so) <br /> <br />12. All Apologies 9.5/10 <br />This is a good way to end the album. It is a really good song, with cool guitar parts. <br /> <br />12. Gallons Of Rubbing Alchohol Flowing Through The Strip 6/10 <br />This is the hidden song. I don't really have much else to say. <br /> <br />Overall, I like Nevermind more because I think the songs are better. But In Utero still kicks Ass! This album is definitely essential to your collection.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|i recently watched this movie and thought it was awesome. My friends favorite movie of ALL time is Fight Club. he's watched at least 20 times. Well at the moment I am thinking that this is my movie of ALL time.(i havent had one yet) The soundtrack has an awesome techno-like symphonic mood to it and was absolutley fantastic in the film. I(obviously) recommend you pick this one up if you liked the movie and liked the music in it.
B0007MVXQG|1.0|You've got to be kidding.  Dual Disc is the biggest recording industry ripoff I've seen yet.  The advertising says that it will work on any CD player.  A disclaimer on the packaging says it may not work on all CD players.  If the disc doesn't agree with your player, no big deal, you just burn it to a blank disc and listen to that, right?  Nope.  The disc is copy protected.  Well, how about creating mp3s so you can at least listen on your portable player?  Wrong again, the disc isn't recognized!  That leaves only one option . . . buying the more expensive deluxe edition, whether you actually care about the DVD content or not.  Is this legal?
B000063S6Z|5.0|I like this album, however, and like it from start to finish.  It's solid and entertaining, but he doesn't really have songs in the mix that shred the tranquility.  Overall, it just has a sunnier disposition and doesn't really even have the occasional dark mood track.  That's what hinders this album from being as sucessful from the last one.  What you get is still good, but it proves that people come down on you if they buy your album thinking they'll get exactly what they expect without hearing it.  It also demonstrates the influence of Eminem in his put downs of him and his style.  It's all good, but more mid-tempo.  His choice of samples and guest vocalists is still excellent and the best song, in my opinion, is one  that he actually sings, \\"Signs of love.\\" I think that's really an indication about why this album is more positive, he was in love with someone when he wrote this album.
B000003TA4|5.0|The album \\"Nevermind\\" is my favorite album of all time!! It has been my favorite for a long time now, and it will probably continue for a lot longer. I often read negative reviews of items that I love, and I become angry enough to review the item myself, just to add more positive reviews to Amazon. Nevermind is one of those albums that get a lot of positive and negative reviews, and every time I see a one star review, I want to shoot that reviewer! Then I read that reviewer's other reviews and find out that they like bands that I absolutely HATE like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Korn, Guns N' Roses etc. (I think all of those bands are a bunch of posers!) Whenever that happens, I feel so angry that I want to post some kind of protest review!  Many people think that this album is overrated I definitely don't think so! It may even be underrated considering all of the negative one star reviews out there! Anyway, my reviews of each song are:      1. Smells Like Teen Spirit 11/10   My favorite song of all time!! (I know, call me a poser because Kurt didn't think this song was so great or whatever, I still think it's great) It is a great way to open the album, or any album for that matter!! There is such energy to that song that is so unexplainable!! When I was first getting into Nirvana (about 5 years ago) I would listen to that song, then listen to it again because the song is so amazing!! This was the song that made Nirvana famous, and I am glad it did! Many people may think the song is overplayed then give it a bad review, but how often it is played does not effect how good a song is at all!! The best song of all time could be on repeat for 100 years and end up breaking the speaker! That does not change how good a song is. You may get tired of it, and if you do turn it off and don't listen to it for a while. After a while, you can turn the song on again, and get into it all over again. It is a great song!! The video is great too.    2. In Bloom 9.5/10   Also a great song! It is a really good song to hear right after the previous song! It is really catchy and was one of the first nirvana songs that I got into. The video for it was really cool! They were supposed to look like The Beatles on Ed Sullivan (Because that was when The Beatles were getting really big too! Obviously the Nirvana didn't get as popular as The Beatles did but it was still sending a similar message. The Beatles are also one of my favorites too!) In Bloom is a ridiculous song.    3. Come As You Are 10/10  Another classic by Nirvana! This song was the second biggest hit off \\"Nevermind\\" (Lithium might be played more though, I'm not sure) the melody of this song is totally brilliant! I Love it!!    4. Breed 9.5/10  I think this song is underrated. I love how this song rocks really hard! The lyrics are rad, and the song is very catchy. I also love how you can hear the guitar panning between speakers during the guitar solo. Absolute Brilliance to the ear!    5. Lithium 10/10  This is my second favorite song by Nirvana, and is the very first Nirvana song I heard. The song is brilliant, there isn't a whole lot I could say about this song that hasn't been said countless times before. (Unlike Teen Spirit, where I have a somewhat different opinion on.)    6. Polly 9/10  This is probably my least favorite on here, but it is still brilliant none the less. The worst song here is still a 9/10, which is better than a lot of band's best song! It has some very dark lyrics, and has a cool chorus. It is brilliant.    7. Territorial Pissings 10/10  I think this is the most underrated song on this album, and I think it is brilliant! (\\"Brilliant\\" is a very used word for this album, because that word describes the album so well!) There is such a special energy about this song that is ridiculous! I really like how different this song is. It is a perfect song to play when you are pissed off at something!    8. Drain You 9/10  Brilliant! I love the sound effects during the middle sectionof the song! I also love the furious four chords that you hear right after the rad build up!    9. Lounge Act 9/10  It is brilliant! I love the cool Bassline. Nothing much else for me to say other then saying \\"Brilliant\\" another five times!    10. Stay Away 9.5/10  I LOVE this song!! It is also a very good song to listen to when you are pissed off!! The drums are awesome! The bassline is also really cool!! Brilliant!!!    11. On A Plain 9.5/10  This song is also brilliant! (As are every song on here!!) The lyrics are very haunting, resulting chills down your spine! There aren't enough positive comments that I can say about this album!    12. Something In The Way 10/10  This song is Brilliant! (I know that I've said Brilliant on every song on here! The album is just too brilliant!!) This song isn't really about Kurt living under a bridge (even though many people believe that. I can understand, because I believed it too for a while until recently) the song is about the alienation from the rest of the world as if Kurt was homeless living under a bridge. The atmosphere in this song is soo cool! I think this song is a great way to end such a remarkable album! Normally I would think that a song that really rocks is the best way to end an album, but not in this case. The dark chilling mellow atmosphere is magnificently captured in this song. The chello sound rules! The song is very moving!    12. Endless, Nameless 7/10  This is the hidden song on Nevermind. It is mainly just a bunch of noise and feedback with Kurt screaming random things. It is about 6:40 long. I think it is a cool addition to the album; I don't listen to it as much as all of the other songs on this album but whatever.    This concludes my review of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\". It is a great classic that has been very influential. One of my complaints about other reviews I have read is people complaining about Kurt Cobain not being such a great guitar player. Nirvana is not the kind of band that has a million 20 minute guitar solos in every song. That wasn't what this band was about. They were about making good music, not impressing everybody with the fast solos. The guitar solos that Nirvana did have were more about serving, and making the song better. Not about how many complicated licks we can pull off. I'm not criticizing the bands that do have really impressive solos. I'm just saying that wasn't the point of Nirvana. Dave Grohl is an insane drummer by the way. Another complaint I have is other reviewers saying that Nirvana was the reason that all of the bad punk music of today exists. I totally disagree. The music before Nirvana and the grunge movement are bands like Motley Crue and Poisen. Those bands were not about the integrity of the music and songwriting; they were concerned about how many girls they get. And people don't really know of what music would be out today if Nirvana didn't exist. If anyone can somehow go in a time machine and somehow make Nirvana not exist and show me the music of today if it is better, maybe I will believe them. But that is never going to happen. Nirvana did not destroy rock, they improved it dramatically. We could still have the bad hair bands of the 80's but instead, we got Brilliant art like this album.    \\"Nevermind\\" is my favorite album of all time, and will probably be my favorite for a long time. If you agree with anything I said in this review, you will probably realize the brilliance of this album! \\"Nevermind\\"
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Donnie Darko is a stunning movie, complimented by a dark/eerie sense of urgency to find out what the hell is going to happen.  The acting,directing,and setting was astonishing.  The movie was very consistent with no gaps inbetween, yet very unique and questionable pertaining to the storyline.  Many people will have many different interpretations as to what this movie is all about, however I find this movie to focus primarily on time-travel.  Time-travel gives Donnie the opportunity to control future occurrences from happening.  A movie about manipulation of FATE.  Ok enough of my philosophical analysis.  The movie will leave you in question no doubt the fist time you view it, however this movie has an emotional replay value.  Meaning you need not to put this movie away in your library.  It will certainly be a movie in and out of your dvd player on a consistent basis, and with no surprise it without a doubt would spark a very interesting conversation with whomever you watched it with....(and please don't talk yourself like Donnie).

B00028HBKM|4.0|Directors Mel Gibson and Michael Moore (\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\")stirred controversy in 2004 for their films.  Many loved them, many hated them.  Regardless, their names were undeniable that year.  \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", Mel Gibson's directorial follow-up to the Oscar-winning \\"Braveheart\\" (1995), takes Christianity to a new level.  It stars Jim Caviezel (\\"Pay It Forward\\") and Monica Bellucci (\\"Irreversable\\").  This film portrays the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life.  Through the graphic images and the powerful dialect is one of the most unforgettable films of that year and of ever.  This film doesn't play part fiction, part non-fiction; it plays according to to The Bible and other testaments.  This film never holds back on its soul.  Meanwhile, it made film history in many ways. <br /> <br />Beyond the controversy is one of the most remarkable films about religion.  Though occassionally some scenes run too slow, and some text is unnecessarily repetitive, its strengths lie upon its ability to tell a story thoroughly.  The emotional aspect never fades from when Jesus is captured to the end.  Through the torture, the blood, the humiliation, and the death, some tears may fall.  Though the conclusion is unquestionable to first-time viewers, the powerful message remains at its peak.  Beyond the last 12 hours of Jesus's life also shares his beliefs and his own faith.  Such written quality was approved by many Christian churches and organizations.  Therefore, this film became the symbol of their religion. <br /> <br />The physical aspects of the film are accurate to those from the actual early first century living through the costumes and the sets.  They resemble the pictures from the testaments and history books.  The strong demands for them were met beautifully.  Jesus's physical state during his torture is wonderfully portrayed with make-up.  The blood, the sweat, and bruises add to the powerful standpoint that the film deserves.  Through the work, Jim Caviezel may have been mistaken for the actual Jesus Christ.  Its close graphic images were necessary to include and were wonderfully crafted, proving the level of pain endured.  Such crew-work quality earned this film three Oscar nominations: Best Make-Up, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score. <br /> <br />Though all the actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern stand out.  Caviezel's performance as Jesus Christ could not have been done better.  His state of pain in itself, though a few scenes were real, gives new life to this film.  This proved highly difficult since he was in that state of sadness or pain through most of the film.  Morgenstern's portrayal of Mary proved as emotional as Caviezel's.  Though she didn't say much, her facial expressions alone reveal Mary's times, especially witnessing Jesus's torture. <br /> <br />Such overall film quality makes \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" worth watching at least once, Christian or not.  Due to the graphic nature, this is not recommended for children or the faint of heart.  Viewers should use their own discretion.  Few will end this film feeling nothing.  Therefore, this will surely remain commonly talked about to its viewers, even those who dislike it.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore, stepped onto this project in the beginning,  he knew it was gonna be tough, but his love for composing and directing music  motivated him to stick it out.  For that, he recently won a grammy award. *cheers* this is the most awe inspiring thing ever recorded.  The power behind it is absolutely amazing cause so much of those movies are carried not only on sound, but on music as well.  GO HOWARD keep writing!
B0002OERI0|5.0|To think that a bunch of snotty (albeit talented) kids could grow up to produce something of this magnitude and scope... it just flat out amazes me. I'm a huge fan of Green Day's earlier works, but I've been VERY disappointed with what they've been coming out with for the last 10 years or so. This album has dispelled those misgivings entirely. Without a doubt, \\"American Idiot\\" is an amazing piece of artistry and feeling that modern music has been lacking in recent years. Not only is it a scathing indictment of our \\"fearless leader\\" but it is a complex story of modern America itself. <br />Although I miss Mike Dirnt's usually amazing basslines, I can understand why he toned himself down- he, like any true band member, put the songs' integrity first rather than show off. I respect him very highly for that. <br />All in all, this is a great album and EVERYONE must own it.
0060523794|3.0|Yes Mr Gerstner called all the shots in the 90's and yes he, the company, and the stockholders made a lot of money doing it - and no IBM doesn't need another cheerleader but I must say this book does do a good job of describing what it took to turn around IBM.  As a side benefit it also helps bring some logic to the reason \\"why\\" the computer arena runs the way it does.  In addition it also gives a \\"business persons'\\" look at the other major players in the market not just an insider techie perspective.      The target market for this book is for experienced business leaders, young IT managers, AND the everyday computer client.  I would categorize myself as an everyday client.  As a client and growing up with Apple as a market leader in the 80's and Microsoft in the 80 & 90's.  I would have to say Lou Gerstner's \\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\\" book was the missing piece to the computer puzzle for me.  It balances out what I previously read in Bill Gates' books \\"The Road Ahead\\" and \\"Business at the Speed Thought.\\" The Microsoft desktop with it's web and email access was the standard as far as I was concerned.  I simply was not aware of the IBM history that occurred prior to 1990.  Looking back, when I was in school we had personal computers on our desktop and in college we had internet access, and when I starting working, email was the norm. So you can imagine my surprise when I picked up this book and discovered that these three technology's were not the norm prior to 1990.  I had no idea that much of IBM's work from the 50's & 60's made a lot of today's e-lifestyle possible. Being in the computer industry for the last 12 years and seeing the web reach critical mass and its' subsequent explosion shed little light on what preceded it.      POSITIVES:  Here are a couple of the ideas I liked from the book:    Gerstner's/IBM High Performance Principles:  Drivers for success:  1 The marketplace is the driving force  behind what a company should be involved in    2 What isat the core of a company: In IBM's case, it is a technology and nothing else  3 Look outside to measure success via customer satisfaction and increased shareholder value   4 Operate as an entrepreneurial organization with minimum of bureaucracy and never ending focus on productivity  5 Have a sense of urgency   (Planning & analysis is secondary to action)   6 Never lose sight of strategic vision, direction & mission Reward teamwork   8 Be sensitive to ALL employees needs    NEGATIVES:  When comparing this book to that of GM's Jack:  \\"Straight From The Gut\\" where you almost need a score card to keep track of all the players - It seems to me, that the entire story of IBM and its' turn around was not told, for what ever reason some information was omitted.  I can only recall Mr Gerstner pointing out at the most 4 people.    I think it is fair to say Mr Gerstner does minimize the impact that the phone companies, like MCI, had on rolling out a individual customer based internet product in the early 90's.    Furthermore, one of the other things that Mr Gerstner  failed to address was the on-going concerns between access types in the public vs private domain:  business vs personal use of access, cost sharing and privacy issues when at work.  Issues like, on-line shopping, stock trading, personal email, etc are vague and unsupported.  Maybe this is because he is not a so-called \\"techie.\\"    Whether you buy this book or not I think it is safe to say what happens in your cube on your desktop right now was made possible in large part by the people in this book, ALL the IBM folks (past and present) as well as their competitors.      In summary I can say that I looked at this title a year ago and now in retrospect after finishing it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it.  I picked up the CD version at the library
0345440900|1.0|In need for some routine in my and my baby's life, I bought this book.  After reading the book, I felt miserable that I had ruined my baby with 'acidental parenting', as the author puts it.  Her paterns did not work at all with my colicy / permature baby, and I found myself crying about it over and over thinking that I was a bad parent.  I suggest parents  read 'Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby' by Marc Weissbluth instead.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|A classic film genre that hasn't seen much action in the past few decades is the heist film. The re-imagining of OCEAN'S 11 did a nice job as did the re-imagining of THE ITALIAN JOB. Unfortunately, even those both of those movies had some great elements, neither one was original enough to even come up with their own title.<br /><br />The original THE ITALIAN JOB, on the other hand, was made during an era when movies still reeked of originality.  In the film, Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is released from prison after having served his time. He receives an interesting message from a close friend of his. His friend was in the process of steeling over 4 million dollars in gold right under the noses of the Italian mafia. Unfortunately, the mafia found out about the gig and had him killed. Before he was killed, he had set a plan in motion so that Charlie could take over the operation.<br /><br />Charlie agrees to do the job, but he needs some serious financing. So, Charlie breaks into the prison to visit Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), one of the most wealthy and well-respected crooks in England. At first Bridger dismisses Charlie's request and has some of his goons pay him a visit. Then he finds out exactly how much is at stake and who they will be stealing the money from. He has a change of heart and give Charlie the money he needs. From there it's one misadventure and adventure after another leading from England to Italy, past mafia goons, to the World Cup, and over some mountains involving $4 million dollars in gold bars and three red, white, and blue Mini-Coopers.<br /><br />The casting and acting in THE ITALIAN JOB is some of the most original in Hollywood history. Michael Caine was not yet a huge star, but had just finished filming ALFIE when he was cast in THE ITALIAN JOB. His role as Charlie Croker made him an international movie sensation. Noel Coward was specially picked by director Peter Collinson because of Coward's generosity to Collinson in his youth. The studio had originally wanted Nicol Williamson, but Collinson swore by Coward. Coward's prescence as the lordly Mr. Bridger added a touch of class to the movie. Then there's Benny Hill, playing the large women loving Professor Simon Peach. The Benny Hill show had yet to be broadcast, but even in the supporting role of Professor Peach, Hill illustrates his connection to bawdiness.<br /><br />The movie includes a famous song entitled \\"The Self Preservation Society\\" which, in large part because of this movie, has become a favorite song played in English football (soccer) matches. Besides that famous song, there's also several great pieces of dialogue including Michael Caine's line, \\"You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\\" which was voted the most memorable film line of all time in a 2003 movie poll.<br /><br />The final scene in THE ITALIAN JOB remains as one of the most memorable, yet most frustrating in all of movie history. The film ends without any resolve because the studio had hoped to make a sequel, but the sequel never came.  It's a dirty shame, really, because this is one movie that a sequel would have added something to the original.<br /><br />The DVD includes the famous deleting \\"walzing Minis\\" scene, a commentary track, the original trailers, and a documentary. The commentary track is rather interesting to listen along with, but the documentary (chopped into three parts) is incredibly boring!e studio had originally wanted Nicol Williamson, but Collinson swore by Coward.

B000002L1L|5.0|One of DP's best recordings. Regardless of the tensions during the making of this recording, the sheer virtuosity, musicianship and professionalism of the band members resulted in a truly majestic accomplishment. It is instructive to compare \\"The Battle Rages On\\" with Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto (\\"Emperor\\"); though the styles of music are very different they are animated by the same magnificent spirit.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is one of the most exciting albums to come out this year. Last year doesn't seem so hot in retrospect. Maybe that's because the Mars Volta didn't release an album in 2004. It's only three months in, and we have twenty classic records already. We have a bunch of recordings to displace The Arcade Fire. This is definitely the album to be talking about now. Their previous weird album set the stage for this. Maybe that album was just a rehearsal for Frances The Mute. The artwork in the cover jacket looks like stuff done by Magritte. The record was inspired by a journal that ex-member Jeremy Ward found. Most noticeable is that they sing en Espanol. That is a major contribution. The vision is deep and wide. The Mars Volta is one of the best live shows. They can't be topped for showmanship. I actually ran into Omar Rodriquez-Lopez in New York City while he was mixing this album. He had just arrived from Brazil. We were backstage at a Muse gig, a band that they had played with several times. Omar seemed pretty excited about the new album, because he was producing it, and they were capturing the sound of the live band. The Mars Volta had two years in the can of solid touring. They had perfected their tone and expression. The Mars Volta are like a shark: they need to be on the move. This album evokes many moods and sounds. For every reference and comparison to Led Zeppelin, people have to realize that the song \\" L' Via L' Viaquez\\" breaks into a mariachi part, before exploding into a heavy rock sound that rips the roof off any Zeppelin comparisons. This album is seventy minutes of sheer terror and beautiful vistas. The Mars Volta has joined the ranks of the American bands that can do no wrong.
0765301598|3.0|At no time have I expected the work of Frank H to be recreated.  I did read all the Houses books (which, are better than the Legends series), and once I started the Legends I felt obligated to finish.  No reason whatsoever these should have taken three books.  A good editor could have made this one decent novel.  If the point was to show where all the parts of Dune originated (bene g's, mentats, guild, et al), why did they finally come together in a rush in the last 100 pages of a trilogy?  Talk about folding space to make the stars line up!     One point about possible \\"liberally borrowing from other works\\".  I just read HG Wells \\"War of the Worlds\\".  The discription of the martians in their machines is VERY much like how the Cymeks and Titans are discribed.  Oh well.     I fear for the sequel to \\"ChapterHouse\\" that they are puportedly writing.  Hope and pray for an editor.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This is a great movie to sit down and watch anytime. No matter how many times you have seen it, it doesnt stop being funny. It is one of those movies that you dont need to be in the mood for, and I could watch it all the time. It is such a funny movie. Will Ferrell is at the top of his game in this one, playing a much different character then he does in old school. He makes me laugh nonstop in this movie, and so do all of his costars. Most everyone in Anchorman is very funny, and it makes it such an enjoyable film. I would defintely recommend you buy Anchorman, and you will not regret it.
B0002G2B2W|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie a lot, mainly because it was so different from most of the run of the mill movies that Hollywood has  produced in the last couple of years.  <br />Although its pace was a little slow in the beginning, it picked up some pace once we start understanding the going-ons a little better. Once there, it kept me so engrossed and just a little bit confused. It struck as a movie that had the suspence of \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and some hints of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\". Giving this movie a category may be eternally difficult. But calling it a spotless movie is not!.
0812550757|5.0|I couldn't put this book down after the first chapter.  I liked Ender's Game, but this one I think tops the list as far as sci-fi novels go. <br /> <br />Ender is back in this sequel.  He was banished from earth after his episode with the buggers, and now has become a \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", which is one who finds out everything about a dead person's life in order to tell those who were near to the person what this person's true intentions were during his or her life.  A new species has been discovered on the planet Lusitania, and when one of the scientists studying the new species is found murdered one day, the community is shocked and a speaker is called upon.  Ender answers the call, even though 22 years will have passed on Lusitania before he can make it there... <br /> <br />The characters in this book are tremendously engaging.  I found myself very interested in their lives and the conflicts they feel over the new species, a deadly disease that has only recently been contained, and the arrival of Ender and the instant affect he has on them.  Highly, highly recommend as a book that will introduce you to unique new ideas and leave you thinking.
0684800713|1.0|I read this because I had heard so many rave about this being one of Hemingways best books.  I just didn't get it.  To me it was the story of one long drunken binge by a bunch of self absorbed losers.  The discriptions of the bull fights were interesting, but, I just fail to see the greatness of this work.  I cared nothing for any of the characters.  I know the writer himself was an alcoholic and it obviously played into this story.  Maybe it's just me.   <br /> <br />I did however, enjoy \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\".
0393324818|4.0|In Moneyball, author Michael Lewis sets out to show how you can win as a major-league franchise when your roster looks more like the Bad News Bears than a professional outfit. Whether or not he convinces you the reader of his purpose is up to you (I don't necessarily agree with it), but it makes an interesting and illuminating read.<br /><br />In many ways, it is an alternative history of baseball in the modern era: in a time when home-run sluggers are prized above all else (nevermind how they got those homers), the Oakland A's of Billy Beane take a different tact. Smallball is king in Beane's view, one that he formed while as a member of the Oakland management team. Beane's own brief career is documented by Lewis, as well as the rise of baseball stats guru Bill James and the cult of numbers he helped inspire (sabremetrics). Beane is one of the few baseball men who not only reads James's theories, but tries to apply them to his team.<br /><br />The story almost speaks for itself: at the time of writing, the A's had managed to continuously appear in the playoffs. Doubters will scoff that Beane's methods fail in the long run: where are the World Series rings? The fact that a small-market team like the A's can manage a run like they have, with the limited resources they have, seems to be overshadowed by that glaring lack of wins when it counts.<br /><br />And so, without denying the veracity of James's arguements as they are presented in the book, I personally didn't buy Beane's approach. Too often, it seemed, Beane and his cohorts were reducing the game on the field to a series of continuous data sheets, typing out the player's ability to get on base over their ability to hit home runs or run the bases. While it's good to try and overthrow some of the baseball \\"traditions\\" that have actually served to harm the modern game, Moneyball offers a solution that is almost \\"scorched earth\\" in its approach: throw out the old rules and concentrate on stats previously ignored.<br /><br />On some level, Moneyball doesn't necessarily champion Beane's approach, but Lewis plays into the hands of the A's by (inadvertantly by his postscript account) making Beane out to be a wizard at figuring out the game. This is the same Beane who traded Johnny Damon to the Red Sox (readers in the post-Red Sox Series win last year could be forgiven for laughing a little at Beane's short-sightedness). This is the same Beane who traded two of his \\"big Three\\" pitchers in the past offseason. This is the same Beane who struggles to manage what little cash he has, and he is prone to mistakes. While Lewis doesn't shy from that side of the equation, he almost never addresses the failures of Beane's system as much as its successes. There is something unique about Beane's approach, that is for sure. But Lewis almost destroys his own arguement by leaving out those details that don't fit with his hypothesis.<br /><br />Also, for a baseball book \\"Moneyball\\" is totally lacking in terms of giving the reader a \\"feel\\" for the team in question. Beane and his hired helpers are (rightly or wrongly) the focus of the tome, to the exclusion of players like Barry Zito or Tim Hudson. In a way, it's misleading to list it as a \\"sports book\\"; it would be a more accurate fit on the business list.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Moneyball\\" is a flawed but necessary read for those wondering what modern sports culture is all about. You come away from it feeling some sympathy for the way Billy Beane has to run his business, but you don't get a feel for the players affected by that business. You never really see the success on the field; you just get Beane and Lewis telling you \\"it works\\". That part of the equation keeps me from endorsing this as accurate or solid. But it will challenge your view of our nation's pastime for the better, as you learn what smaller teams have to sacrifice in order to surivive.red. <br /> <br />On some level, Moneyball doesn't necessarily champion Beane's approach, but Lewis plays into the hands of the A's by (inadvertantly by his postscript account) making Beane out to be a wizard at figuring out the game.

0380778556|5.0|This book has been around forever and is still popular. The suspense builds and the reader is drawn into the description of the characters and the elegant house.  Some earlier reviewers revealed the answer to the mystery so you may only want to read the first few reviews on this page.
B0001I561E|1.0|When i sat down to watch this film with my niece and nephews i expected to see an accurate representation of one of the greatest nations of our world. However, i was deeply disappointed with what i saw. Not only is the Arabic culture put to shame in this cliche display of samurai swords and desert wastelands, but the historical era is pushed aside in a weak effort to entertain.  <br />First, i was disappointed that the film was in english. I thought that it would at least be in Persian if not the language of Urdu which arose in the military camps during Sultan Akbar's reign. And Not only does the Sultan in the movie not exist but neither does his advisor unless Disney is hinting at the role Nur Juhan took in her husband Jahangir reign of the Mughals. Also, the architechtual layout is all wrong. Such structures were not created until the rule of Sultan Shah Jahan around 1630. If the movie was set in 1630 though, the royal garb of princess Jasmine would predate Nur Jahan's designs and therefore signify economic stress in the city of Aggrabah (which is obviously not the case due to the oppulent splendor which frequents the film.)I would like to add that due to the strict confines of class in the early Islamic world the peasant Aladdin would never have been allowed to rise to any station of importance. Such fanciful events should be eliminated from our storybooks as they give children false hope and skewed ideas of society and how it works. <br />All in all i found this film to be entirely frusterating. When we push history aside for the sake of entertainment we know for sure that our country is taking a step in the wrong direction. The youth of America should rise up against this movie and its subtle hints at white supremacy. I know one thing for sure though, my children will never see this movie.
0380799006|5.0|This book is extraordinary.  The writing pulls you in because of the humble nature of the author.  After reading it, there is no doubt they know what they are talking about and it's not because of their credentials per say.  It's spells out everything so clearly that there is no denying the issues.  The big thing to know about this book is there are REAL specific tips and rules for communicating and dealing with situations.  It is very well organized.  And, there is more information than \\"How to talk to your kids...\\"  I wondered if I should read both - sure enough, you do need both.  I'm grateful for this book.
B00005N9CV|1.0|If Diana Krall wasn't a tall, semi-attractive blonde, I doubt there would be any interest in her.  She is like many contemporary 'jazz' performers whose voices and instruments are emotionless and flat. Please do us a favor and stop brutalizing the old standards and trying to moderize them - they are perfect they way they are. No one can match the REAL jazz performers like Ella, Louis Armstrong and Sarah Vaughn.  Stop wasting your money on the likes of Diana Krall, and while I'm at it - Kenny G. <br />Ick.  There's no accounting for taste...
B00014NE62|5.0|This novel was believed to be Forster's most biographical work, the story of Maurice, a middle class Edwardian who is young, gifted and hopeful and yet strangely at odds with what society expects of him. He embarks upon an affair whilst at University, with a fellow student. He also mingles with like minded men at begins to realise that he is not alone and no longer affraid. Discovery of his affair and the consequent threat of expultion along with the arrest of an old friend for casual pick ups, fill him with fear. Once back at home with his Mother and Sister he is under pressure to provide and find a Girl, his former circle of friends gone or in hiding, he feels lost; even seeking therapeutic hypnosis to cure his \\"disease\\".<br /><br /> Then he embarks upon an accidental affair with the roguish and ruggedly sexy Gardener, fear and paranoia overwhelm as well as great struggles with the British class system as was. Will love find a way for the unlikely pairing? Beautifully filmed, intensley played and one of the first films to describe Gay sex in the context of Gay love. The film almost certainly shook up beliefs in the 1980's when it was realesed, as the book did in the 1900's when it was released and promptly banned.<br /><br /> Wilby is marveluosly full of anxst while Graves is bumptous, passionate and extremely erotic.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Waterlog's \\"Brained Off Drugs\\" album and music is the only thing I have heard better than Kanye's \\"College Dropout\\". Waterlog's music stands out amongst a crowd of millions and Kanye's album makes mainsteam hip-hop seem out-dated, or maybe even just behind the curve. I can't wait for the next new wave of music from both Waterlog and Kanye!!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|This album is good - but with that being said, it's not as good as it's been made out to be. There are some major strong points though. The guitar work is very catchy (most of the time) and the bass does a fairly good job as well. Franz Ferdinand's singer, though, is probably their biggest strong point. His voice is...for lack of a better word, \\"romantic\\". The sound engineer also did a great job with not only his voice but everything, and the album has a very warm sound to it.  <br />The bands biggest fault is the drummer. If you're going to be a dance band, then you have to have a good drummer, since that's what dance music tends to focus on. He plays the same beat throughout the entire album, and it terribly handicaps what could be a much better album. The best song, in my opinion, is \\"Take Me Out\\" This was the band's first single (as you probably know) and for very good reason. The song begins with a steady guitar until slows down to half of what they were playing in the intro - and this has a remarkably cool effect. Plus the song contains the catchiest guitar riff on the whole album. <br />I am glad that music such as this is becoming mainstream - that's fantastic. However, it has been slightly overhyped because frankly its not quite as good as people are making it out to be. But, if you want something you can dance to - go buy it.
B000696PWC|2.0|I think I am in minority when I see all the praise-showering reviews and zillion hits will I receive on the negative button. But I have to say this: Is this what pop should be? Yes, Kylie's songs are memorable, danceable tunes with decent production but when the hot times of the single or album diminish away, what remains left? Is there anyone who does not think that \\"I should be so lucky\\" is an extremely repulsive cheesy song? So don't you think \\"Can't get you out of my mind\\" will sound cheesy after a few years (even now gets no further airplay, because it is  simply not  a \\"classic\\"?) I mean pop should revolve around more meaningful lyrics, less naked asses, and less excellently good looking dancers jumping on the background? In any video-clip, Kylie is almost half-naked, barely covering her wonderful body- all songs are plenty of hh oohhhs shss sexy sounds etc etc Isn't this one of the reasons - almost the most important one- why several of you buy her albums?    IMHO, this kind of cheesy pop is the main factor why the disastrous times of music, I mean rap, hip-hop, are prevailing... It started late 80's, reached its zenith in 90's...If you want cheesy,  brainless but fun pop just to dance and jump around but to forget everything you hear a few months later, Kylie of course offers high quality...at least her heart is in it...she knows her limits (vocal, artistic etc) and tries to do what she does best...but if you want real brainy pop, go for Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, New Order, Air, and some Madonna albums...with meaningful, thought-provoking lyrics, mind-boggling tunes that do not sound cheesy even after 20 years. Yes, these guys or bands have no asses to show off or they do not sound exotic or reflect Ibiza-pools atmosphere but they are real talented...and if you are willing to be in tune with modern times, at least go for Anastacia's last album...with much insight than all the sexy Kylie offerings have
B000002IJO|4.0|Certainly not having the greatest vocalist in the world in range and variety Ratt certainly could pen a good song. Having tasted earlier releases through other friend's collections, for some reason Ratt's previous catalogue never caught my imagination fully. However this was an impulse buy and I have to say even to this day I find it to be extremely enjoyable and hypnotic. The production is full bodied (I thought previous releases were thin sounding) and there is a swagger and sexiness of say an Aerosmith in there for sure. There is nothing beyond Sunset Strip lyrically, not a bad thing being naively honest with it. Most importantly every song has stood the test of time well. Personal favs are the groove driven 'Slip of the Lip' and the driven 'Drive Me Crazy'. There are also later highlights in the superb verus chorus tradings of 'It Doesn't Matter' and 'Enough is Enough' with its Stone-esque bravado. Ultimate highlight is the eighties hooker and bars '7th Avenue' which sleazes and purrs to perfection. The musicianship is always solid if not workman like at times. All in all I think \\"Dancing Undercover\\" is a fine representation of this solid band that I thoroughly recommend any lover of the best aspects of eighties rock add to their collection.
B0007GADZO|5.0|1st off i'd like to state that I love Mr. Vai's unique blend of guitar virtuosity-arrangements-the most highly qualified musicians to be found anywhere whom help him peform this music in studio or LIVE-uniqueness amoungst less than a handful of extremely gifted virtuostic electric guitarists & his cross between a Zappa/James Brown form of showmanship!! HIS OWN.    I had to leave out a # of impressive qualities Vai has, which make him a 1 of a kind musician. Otherwise half of my entire reveiw would consist of describing the manner in which he works &  gives us our joy while listening to his unique 'type' of music.    I'd rather have given this great cd a 4 & 1/2 star rating, but since I only had 4 or 5 stars to choose from I chose 5, b/c i'd like others thinking of buying this cd to do so.    Also in 'the title' of MY review, I believe that Mr. Vai has now(imo)started to use the brilliant invention/original idea of his musical mentor, Mr. Zappa in that this cd is(I believe)the 1st in the vein of The \\"Project/Object\\" idea it seems Vai will now  continue. Many other Vai  affciandos will undoubtedly DISAGREE w/me thinking that Vai has ALREDAY done this w/many of his cd's.    However,I believe those albums were more like Zappa's \\"Conceptual  Continuity\\" invention than the \\"P/O\\" idea? I guess we'll find out wether i'm corect or not whenever Vai releases his next NEW cd.    I must confess I remain a bit confused w/Vai's 'story' that is partially revealed in the 'booklet/lyric sheet'. While I only gave it 1 read(maybe if I re-read 'it' the story will make his pupose clear instantly to me?)but what I 'got' from the story is Vai's newest cd is about sprituality & redemtion, but for now i'll just enjoy the great music on the cd & VERY SOON the LIVE performance of same here in St Louis!    Paul, 1 of my dearest friends COMPLETELY DISAGREES w/me about the  new Vai cd. He feels it's 1 of Steve's weaker efforts & it's songs don't contain enuff 'hook's'(amoungst other complaints)for Paul to consider \\"RI\\" the GREAT NEW cd Vai has been working on seemingly forever!     I do agree w/Paul that unlike the best albums of ALL TIME, \\"RI\\" is NOT truly great from beginning to end, where EVERY song on the album is remarkable! There is no 'filler' material on the very small # of recordings which don't have a wasted second! \\"RI\\" IS NOT 1 OF THEM!     HOWEVER, there are enuff great songs to make this 1 special to me. A few cuts that really blow me away on \\"RI\\" would be, \\"Firewall\\" probably my fave song on here. \\"Freakshow Excess\\" a feast of musical edibles. The goregous \\"Lotus Feet\\" & the 1st cut, \\"Building The Church\\" are imo all arse kicking tunes. Plus there are other very entertaining songs here.    My young, 41 yr old friend(young to me i'm 53)saw Vai just as I did for the 1st time, when Vai played lead for FZ. However Paul continued following Vai's musical odessy(where I didn't until much later)& has been able to see him around 15 times,(even the 2 nites recorded & available right here at \\"AMAZON\\"tm a shameless  commercial:) & he got me back into Vai.     So I now own numerous bootleg vid's of Steve's diff bands(mostly all hi qual both visually & audio wise)as well as many more of his cd's, & while my buddy plays guitar he is not a professional musician like me, BUT I DO respect his musical opinions! How could I not as the very 1st concert he EVER experienced was 1 by the incomprable \\"GENTLE GIANT\\"!! How could one EVER attend a concert by a new band w/NO expectations after seeing the \\"Giant\\" play as your 1st 'live' concert? Good Lord what an introduction to progressive music & the concert experience. How did you choose concerts after that Paul?    Anyway, enuff rambling. \\"Real Illusions-Reflections\\" is a damned   VG cd by Vai, & has enough gratifying songs & virtuoso musicianship that anyone the slightly bit interested in him would go buy in a nanosecond!(IMO)After hearing & seeing Vai & his band live w/the finest drummer playing today, Virgil Donati, I was a tad worried about Jeremy Colson being able to handle a recording & then a grueling world wide tour. But Colson does a fine job, & a few of the new songs have percussion that some Vai cd's do not, & this just really add's to the great stew served up by Vai-Colson-SHEEHAN-MacAlpine & Weiner. Vai ALWAYS seem's to find the BEST drummer's around(DONATI-Bozzio-Mangini)but some can do the recording but can't handle the 2.5 hr nitely shows for months at a time, but Colson handles it well.    So I now have another great cd to add to my Vai collection, & while I haven't had the chance to listen to Sheehan's new cd(Tks Paul)this too should be a  great one. So BUY \\"Real Illusions\\" as you won't waste your money! It's keeper!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is a great Led Zeppelin-esque Heavy Metal album.  Why amazon even calls it \\"Emo\\" is beyod me!!  This is great concept metal!!!These guys even believe in guitar solos, who woulda thunk that bands today till use that concept. <br />Kick As Metal album!  This band is Metal!! Metal Metal Metal!  Metal Metal This, and Metal Metal that!  Let's make the METAL and buy this album!! ...And Remember, if it aint METAL, It's CRAP!!!
0140350276|1.0|First, of all, I would like to warn everyone that this book is NOT illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman, which was the only reason I purchased it.  When I recevied the book, it was a shabby looking paperback with barely any illustrations.  I don't know whose mistake it was, but I called the seller, and they still have not done anything to change it.  So, if you're looking to order this book because of the illustrator, be warned that it isn't Trina Schart Hyman.
B000002HH2|5.0|After the initial shock that was \\"Medulla\\", I picked this up simply because it has most of my favourite Bjork songs on it. Nothing more, nothing less. <br /> <br />\\"Post\\" is a perfect follow up for Bjork's career with The Sugarcubes, and her first solo album, \\"Debut\\". The mixture of different styles is wonderful, and the fact Bjork holds the entire album together is a plus. <br /> <br />The industrial-laced \\"Army of Me\\" is a perfect opener for the album, complete with dark-sounding synth and drumbeats. Thankfully, \\"Army\\" doesn't sum up the whole album like other openers, as \\"Post\\" breaks into the upbeat dance track \\"Hyperballad\\", and followed up with tracks like \\"It's Oh so Quiet\\", \\"Enjoy\\" \\"Isobel\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" <br /> <br />As usual with her work, Bjork's voice is the main attraction as she sings over layer upon layer of strings, trumpets, synths and drums.  <br /> <br />Top marks all around for \\"Post\\"... Bjork newbies should really start with either this or \\"Debut\\"
0060763280|1.0|What he has to say could be boiled down to about 5 pages.  <br /> <br />Don't complain, don't make excuses, don't justify, work hard, work smart, keep learning, buy real estate, start a business, think BIG, tell yourself its ok to be rich and ok to have money. Break out of any subconcious negative money conditioning you may have from your childhood. OK make that 1/4 page. <br /> <br />You will not get your \\"fianacial blueprint\\" from this book, you will have to go to a seminar for that. <br /> <br />His stories seem so contrieved you would think he made them up just for this book as filler. Marv say it aint so. <br /> <br />This is a book for tiny minds. <br /> <br />
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I first heard about Peter Cincotti on the 'Today Show' and decided to find out more about this sensation since he was being called, \\"the next Sinatra.\\"  This album is an excellent follow up to his first self-titled album.  It is based on 1930s jazz, but it's fresh and upbeat.  My favorite tracks are 'On the Moon' written by Cincotti himself, 'You Don't Know Me' a cover of Eddy Arnold and Cindy Walker's hit, and 'Raise the Roof' by Andrew Lippa.  His smooth voice and relaxed piano blend nicely with his band.  I had the chance to hear him play with Baltimore Symphony, and he is one of those performers who performs even better live!!!  After the concert I had a chance to meet him, and he is an extremely sincere and cordial gentleman.  A great musician and person, I am anxiously awaiting his Strathmore debut in April to hear another extraordinary performance!!!
B00005QIPH|5.0|For me, the nineties were, retrospectively and for the most part, a musical low point. Sure, I loved Pearl Jam, Nirvana, The Smashing Pumkins and the like at the time, but I NEVER find myself pulling out those CDs for a nostalgic listen. I do not mean to say that those bands are bad or untalented, but they have not been enduring. The fact of the matter is, that the only discs I still pull out are early to mid-ninties Brit-Pop (Pulp, Stone Roses, Suede) which no one I knew, knew of or even listened to, but me. (I find it funny that these CDs are now Indie treasures as I was not a particularly cool or cutting edge kid.)      When I first picked up Is This It I was on my way to live abroad in London, and it was one of twenty discs that I permitted to transport due to luggage restrictions. My musical life, had I chosen some other of my hundreds of other CDs, would be entirely different today if not for this recording. I listened to it multiple times every day for six months, and I was never bored.  Each day and each listen uncovered something else for my ear to hear. After a decade of grunge and alternative rock, I finally felt like something new and exciting was happening in the music world.    Is This It is a raw, garage rock album that emotes motion and a certain kind of hysteria. Julian Casablancas's voice is not remotely beautiful, but it is the type that adds heart, much like  Bob Dylan's or Johnny Rotten's. Casablancas's lyrics are not poetical, but often funny and always startling real. The sound is all over the place, and yet it is quite centered and precise.    I cannot recommend this product more highly. Along with Pulp's Different Class, Is This It has been, for me, a life-changing album.  The next generation will agree: Classic.
0767834739|4.0|Would you like to know why this one wasn't a waste of time like the first movie?  One reason: Paul Anderson didn't direct it.  Mr. WS Anderson seems to have a knack for taking it upon himself to helm larger scale films with infinite potential and make total crap out of them (which he finally managed to steer away from when AVP rolled around), but since he did not direct this installment, it turned out all right.  He did write it, and that I can live with, because his scripts are very visionary and he is a wonderful writer, just not the best filmmaker in the world. <br /> <br />I've rambled on about him long enough, now let's talk about the movie.  Just a day after the events which took place in Resident Evil, one of the two survivors, Alice (Milla Jovivich), has been taken to Raccoon City hospital and quarantined, where she has been experimented on.  Meanwhile, scientists have ventured back into the hive, where they manage to release the hord of zombies still roaming around down there.  Just thirteen hours later, the city is infested with them, and Alice, who has escaped the facility, must escape with another group of survivors, including STARS special againt Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).  However, this proves to be quite a task for them, as they are not only hindered by mindless, flesh-eating zombies and lightning fast undead canines, but Umbrella Corporation has also unleashed their newest weapon, a 7 foot hulking monstrosity with incredible firepower, code-named Nemesis. <br /> <br />While edgy and seemingly pointless in a few spots, Resident Evil: Apocalypse proves quite an advantage over its predecessor.  The acting is quite well done, the writing seems planned out well and is whitty while sticking to the main points of the movie {kudos to Mr. Anderson), and the zombies are looking pretty juicy!  Not only that, but we are treated to a couple fairly graphic munching scenes.  I was also a little relieved the zombies remained slow, because if they had been very fast(ala Dawn of the Dead '04), there would seem to be no hope, as they've got the humans outnumbered by about a zillion to five.  But, what really stole the show was Nemesis, portrayed by the hulking 6-foot-7 Matthew G. Taylor.  Taylor really lended his performance to Nemesis in this movie, and personally, that is what I felt made this movie worth watching.  Nemesis was just plain cool to watch, and any oversized mutant zombie/human/cyborg decked out in a leather trench-coat-like battle suit with a massive rail gun and an enormous rocket launcher is always fun to watch kick some ass. <br /> <br />All in all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not fail to deliver the chills, thrills, and cheap laughs that horror/action fans today have come to expect.  It even made by heart race a few times.  Saw it and theaters and bought the DVD, and still enjoy it.
B000003S0P|5.0|Whereas \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" showcased the instrumentation of the new lineup, it didn't really expose it through intricate compositions, nor did \\"Sarless and Bible Black.\\" Though SABB came closer to what this incarnation of Crimson could ultimatley acheive, \\"Red\\" was the album that actually did it. A collection of 5 songs (2 instrumentals), \\"Red\\" is the culmination of a musical exploration, with fantastically melded ballads that turn into explosions of jazz(\\"Fallen Angel\\"), Tool-predicting metal (\\"Red\\"), journeys into the near avant-garde, only to come together, then drift away musically (\\"Providence\\"), humorous detours into art-rock(\\"One More Red Nightmare\\") and a song of unspeakable beauty (\\"Starless\\"). Even more amazing, is the fact that the band broke up during the recording of this masterpiece. Just imagine how incredible this could have been if they'd stayed together. I can't. My absolute favourite song at this very moment is \\"Starless.\\" Never has a song ever amazed me so. It is incredible beyond words. All hail the Crimson King!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The movies that single handedly changed cinema forever are finally on DVD.  I was born after these movies were made, and no, I did not have the pleasure of seeing the \\"original trilogy.\\" However, I must say that I do understand the impact these movies and George Lucas had in the film industry.  And as much as people complain that he changed things, this edition is by far the best thing that could ever have happened in the history of movies.  All I can say is that George Lucas is a genius and that if it weren't for these three great films we would never have had \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"<br /><br />There is no question about it; these movies are classics that will transcend time for as long as there are movies being produced. The extra disk with special features is also excellent with plenty of documentaries about how hard it was for George Lucas to get these films made.  This saga is what movies are all about - a true inspiration to future filmmakers and the standard by which all fantasy/Sci-Fi movies are measured.  They influenced my life - what else can I say?
B00000IQW3|5.0|One of the unexpected joys of the 1980s was a \\"little\\" film that packed a huge entertainment wallop.    \\"The Last Starfighter\\" broke new ground in computer graphics, but it was much more than that for many of its fans.    This is a genuinely good story, beautifully acted, sensitively directed by Nick Castle and lovingly crafted by all the technicians who worked on it.      What makes this film work so well from the opening frames are the small touches director Nick Castle adds -- a rural landscape, a trailer park...and small things like a bird feeder and a sleeping dog, plus noises coming from each of the trailers, as well as voices calling out as a new day begins.    Every relationship in this film rings true.  And the main character -- Alex Rogan -- is perfectly portrayed by Lance Guest (who introduces one of the DVD's special features).    Among the great joys of the film are Robert Preston's \\"Centauri\\", the alien being who invented the Starfighter video game (and spread them across the galaxy in hopes of finding candidates for becoming real starfighters), and Dan O'Herlihy's \\"Grig\\", who created a most believable, lovable character underneath his reptilian makeup.    It also has one of the best music scores written for any movie.  Craig Safan enthralled movie fans of all ages with an heroic theme which is interwoven throughout the film -- from the quiet moments, to the romantic scenes, to the space thrills and to the ultimate jubliation of victory over Zur's armada.  It's a tour-de-force musical creation and one of the great scores of all time.    Because of the film's human strengths, it holds up extremely well despite major advances made with digital computer graphics over the past 20 years.  During my first viewing of the DVD, I wondered if Castle had ever been approached about updating those sequences, since most of the blue-screen elements probably still exist.  But we'll leave that sort of revisionism to George Lucas.    This film stands tall as it is.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I will not discuss the plot of this movie in this review, but films like this do make you realize how much harm is man capable of doing.  The holocaust was one of the darkest episodes in human history and this film does not hide any of the cruelty and the suffering that happened during that event.  Do I recommend this film?  I believe every person alive should see it in order to understand what we must prevent from ever occurring again.  This film is also about redemption, the redemption of Schindler and how a man can change during terrible circumstances.  This movie is a classic - Stephen Spielberg masterpiece and one of the most touching films ever made.
0393035158|5.0|Can we conceive of a world based on compassion?  Can we breathe so much vitality into this vision, as to bring about its full expression in this very lifetime?  Can we loosen the strictures of ignorance that permit intolerance and suffering to increase?  Can we work in each moment, in the interest of these goals for the benefit of all?  These are the tacit concerns raised by Sam Harris in his book \\" The End of Faith\\".  To pursue such issues is, ostensibly, to enter uncharted territory.  One should then ask, as Mr. Harris has, what sort of vehicle do we need to traverse the ground, between here and there? His answer meets the landscape of mainstream consciousness like a lightening bolt, vaporizing the stalemate of provincial, dogmatic unreason.  We should, according to the author, dedicate ourselves to developing a dynamic and inclusive dialog focused on addressing the subject of ethics, one where reliance on verifiable claims and reason actually constitutes the dialog and is the sole price of admission.  Mr. Harris argues that these are, in fact, the very methods we have successfully used to illuminate other previously dark corners of our world, and are therefore, well-suited for the job.  Importantly, if we are to truly progress toward our goal we must also skillfully and lovingly turn these methods toward ourselves in an investigation of our most cherished beliefs.  For example, we can now begin to address the question of a personal God.  Armed with a rational way to interrogate the universe, our investigation leads us to a conclusion we may have secretly intuited; there is simply no reason to invoke the hypothesis of personal God in order to manifest ourselves in a most highly realized spiritual form.  Thus, Mr. Harris' prescription for our continued evolution as a people towards increasing awareness and sensitivity is not qualitatively radical, but quantitatively so.  Far from divisive, \\" The End of Faith\\" stands as a sublime act of compassion in our current era.
B000001Y2U|5.0|First, whether or not you like Marilyn Manson's ideaology and Anti-christ attitude, this album is truly great. <br /> <br />Second, if you are rating this album according to your own religious taste, you are obviously wrong.
B000286S8S|2.0|I can't believe no one has written a review criticizing the fact that these idiots released another greatest hits album with almost the same songs as Best of Vol I! Starting to look like Aerosmith. The Roth tunes on the 1st Greatest hits album are much better then these new tunes with Hagar. Eddie is gone, done. This band is over. As much as Roth's new music sucks I'd still rather hold out waiting for him to find a hot guitar player and start playing rock music. Eddie has turned into a self absorbed whack case. Michael is not even playing bass with the band he's slowly working his way into the Wabo Ritas. I gaurantee you Sammy is not back in the band. Eddie will go on another hiatus. This album and the tour was a major bomb from what I read which will be a great motivator to make new music. Yeah right!
B00018D44U|5.0|Unlike many people, I discovered Norah Jones through this album, rather than Come Away With Me. And I have to say that I am glad I did. <br />Come away with me is superb, wonderfully mellow and thoroughly enjoyable. And yet it doesn't really compare to Feels Like Home. <br /> <br />Before you get objective, I don't mean that in a negative way. I just mean the two are very unalike, so comparing them is very difficult, if not impossible. In FLH, Ms. Jones seems to have \\"shed her skin\\", and moved on to the next point in her career. This evolution is very well recieved, and one can only wait and pray for the next album to be released soon! <br /> <br />What is it about NJ's music that hooks you so thoroughly? For me it is the beautiful instrumentals and thoughtful lyrics. A sound so rarely heard today (I'm a huge fan of early seventies music), but craved entirely! This is an album you put on when going to bed, for relaxation and contemplation. This is an album you put on when doing housework, to lighten up the heavy burden and make the time fly. This is an album to play when you're looking for musical inspiration. This is an album to buy and treasure forever. <br /> <br />Sunrise- Shimmering, aural magic. Need more be said? Love the piano licks in the background! <br /> <br />What Am I To You- Initially I couldn't come to this song, but it grew on me the more I heard it. I think actually listenind to the lyrics helped, which definetly carry this song. <br /> <br />Those Sweet Words- Achingly sweet, but still enjoyable, and any song where Norah fiddles on the upper ivories in that delightful way of hers has my vote! <br /> <br />Carnival Town- My favourite song on the album, contemplative lyrics coupled with a haunting melody and a catchy oom-pah bass line...perfection in a nutshell! I performed this one for my music exam, 18/20...yeah! <br /> <br />In The Morning- Sizzling, and you gotta love Norah's vocals on this track. The guitar here is welcomed, and the abscence ofpiano quickly forgotten. <br /> <br />Be Here To Love Me- A tad repetitious, but I loves it all the same. A very Feels Like Home track that would've sounded out of palce on Come Away With Me, but blends perfectly here. <br /> <br />Creepin' In- \\"What the hell?\\" you think. I mean, I know Norah likes to dip her beak in country, but Dolly Parton? ANd then you hear it, and it's not so bad. Not exactly gold, but catchy nontheless, and singable. Nice to see Norah venturing outside of the square she could easily and comfortably sit within. <br /> <br />Toes- More great lyrics, for which we have Lee Alexander to thank I believe. We get back into the main theme of the album with this song. But it throws you off guard for the next one... <br /> <br />Humble Me-This song could easily fit on a country album, but Norah's heart seems bared, and you could easily believe she sings from experience. Otherwise not one of my favourite tracks. <br /> <br />Above Ground- Not too many people are fond of this dark little track, but I actually quite like it. Listen if you're in the mood. <br /> <br />The Long Way Home- Nice rhythm, and sing along-compatible, but all a bit silly really. No less addictive though :P <br /> <br />The Prettiest Thing- A real gem, definetely listen to this one. I feel this is \\"the\\" album song, and should have been the title track! This time the lyrics ache while the music slowly weaves it's magic. Compelling stuff. <br /> <br />Don't Miss You At All- Ha, the Nearness Of You for Feels Like Home! Interesting song, that Norah actually wrote the lyrics over Duke Ellington's music. Probably a standout live performance. <br /> <br />Best tracks: Sunrise, Those Sweet Words, Carnival Town,In The Morning, The Prettiest Thing
B00000J7S8|2.0|Diana Krall isn't doing anything Shirley Horn doesn't do better ... considerably better. Johnny Mandel's string arrangements sound lush behind Horn, not treacly and pallid, as they do on this wannabe CD. Why not buy Shirley's string album, paste a picture of Sharon Stone on the cover and have the best of both worlds? <br />  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is not the first attempt to portray the Passion of Christ in the film genre. But it is the first time that a film has focused so intensely upon the sheer weight of suffering, compressed into the last twelve hours of Jesus' earthly ministry. In one sense, it astonishing that a film of this type was made in the current era - dominated as it is, media-wise, by largely secular imagery and worldly passion. The challenge was obviously intentional.@Mel Gibson put up $25-30 million dollars of his own money to make it. He is, in fact, @conservative Catholic (if rumours are correct, conservative enough to prefer the 'Tridentine' Mass)- so, evidently  token of Mel Gibson's faith.  <br /> <br /> Jeff Shannon's staff review/product description for Amazon.com called the film 'unimaginative' - and,in  sense, it is an unimaginative film. Fifty years ago or so, a film like this would have been watched by - and targetted for, audiences with  a predominantly 'Christian' background. For various reasons, that can no longer be assumed. We live in a multi-cultural society, and besides, atheism is far more widespread. Hence, Mel Gibson seems to have pitched the movie to make it seem acceptable as a kind of empirical narrative - a tragic episode, looked at from the outside. There obviously had to be some 'religious' elements in the film, to keep the Christian context, but the 'Christian' narrative remains relatively weak. The only point where the Christian 'mythos' becomes marked - is in the 'Passion' itself. It is shocking - and deeply moving, and that is the primary impact of the film.@Perhaps it was one man's (Mel Gibson's) way of saying: \\"look how this divine person suffered, for your sake. \\"  <br /> <br /> All things considered, given the limited script, Jim Cavaziel played well in the difficult role as the suffering Christ. Maia@Morganstern took her part well, as the Virgin Mary. The occasional use of Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin in@the dialogue, lent an authenticity to the film, historically. Bit of @change from Biblical characters with a Bronx accent or Queen's English. However, without engaging in 'triumphalist' postures, as if the whole world had to be Catholic, there were surely moments when the divinity of Christ - and triumph over the cross, needed to be made explicit. As it is, the Passion shows the sufferings of Jesus - as an empirical man, and as such, what we see could well have been the sufferings of any other person, crucified on Golgotha. In this respect, Mel Gibson's seems to have run into interpretetive difficulties. These were evident in other ways - e.g. the alleged 'anti-semitism' which necessitated a modification of scripts. This dilemma faces anyone who wants to present the Passion of Christ, without  <br />reading Christian belief into it - on the part of the audience. So far as the Christian 'mythos' goes - the crucixion of <br />Jesus is to be rejoiced in, not lamented. The highly empirical,narrative style, adopted by Mel Gibson, shows us <br />the sufferings, with little sense of the divinity of Christ.@In one sense, its like William Wallace, all over again.I watched this film in a Japanese cinema. Some people cried. The over-riding impression seemed to be that this was just a very brutal and tragic event - the 'Passion of Christ' - one more regrettable torture case.          <br /> <br />
B00008YJHC|5.0|I first want to say that I probably feel so strongly about this album because it was the first Pixies album I ever heard, 13 years ago. I still listen to it with the same awe I did as a 14 year old girl. It is simply beautiful and mind blowing and perfect in every way, if you ask me. The Pixies will always be my favorite band and I wish everyone could experience their genius!  Bossanova is the best! Please buy this album!!!!!!!! Then you will wonder how you ever lived without it!
B000000H64|5.0|This Album, Demanufacture by Fear Factory, was actually the first CD by them i ever bought. I was blown away then, because i hadn't yet fully branched out into the many different genres of Metal, and in a way i'm still blown away for the fact that i can still listen to it and get something out of it. Without a doubt, this is them at their best. <br /> <br />With this album, they perfected their own sound without leaning too much towards Nu-Metal. Whereas their 1999 album Obsolete kind of did, in my opinion. And Digimortal..well..That's the album that made me realize Fear Factory will probably never regain the sound they've captured on this album. This album, Demanufacture, is absolute 5 out of 5 material. <br /> <br />The closest this album comes to a \\"Filler Song\\", is probably New Breed..and even that isn't that bad. It's still listenable. And the rest of the songs are some of the most classic Fear Factory songs, that are still played Live. Songs like the title track \\"Demanufacture\\", \\"Self-Bias Resistor\\", \\"Replica\\", \\"Body Hammer\\" and \\"Pisschrist\\" are, to every long time fan of Fear Factory, the standout tracks on this CD i think. \\"Zero Signal\\", \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\" and \\"H-K (Hunter-Killer)\\" are, to me, the not so famous yet still standout tracks too. <br /> <br />\\"Flashpoint\\" reminds me alot of the song \\"Freedom or Fire\\" off their Obsolete album. It's a good song, but not as memorable to other fans it seems. And the final track \\"A Therapy For Pain\\" is a good finisher. Although very slow, and not at all heavy, it has Burton C. Bell singing pretty well. For people who had only heard Fear Factory's 1992 release Soul of a New Machine, with Burton in death metal mode..\\"A Therapy For Pain\\" is sure to be a shock to them. But the transition from Death Metal band to Cyber-Metal/Industrial Heavy Metal band, was the best thing they did i think. They are much more suited to what they play now, and did play on this album definitely. <br /> <br />This came out in 1995, and since then Fear Factory has obviously and inevitably gained more and more respect, recognition and alot more fans. Long-time fans would already have this, so to those new to Fear Factory..Definitely start with this if you want to get into this band. This is, like i said, Fear Factory at their best.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|I love this album and have had it on repeat for the last couple of days. And it takes a lot longer than an hour to listen thru it because I have to listen to some of the songs over and over again. It's very diffrent from the earlier albums, I read that Josh thinks this is an album you should listen to at night, and I couldn't agree more. <br />Can't even say that I have a favorite song, they are all great in there own different way.  <br />A lot of people only seem to like the first half of the record, and it's great, but to me the last part is just as good, just a bit more dark and mellow.  <br /> <br />Josh's voice is awesome and to me it sounds like he is a lot more secure with it, and dares to play with it like he hasn't done before. <br /> <br />I do wish that Lanegan had had a bigger part on the album, but he was busy with his Bubblegum (great album), so what can you do? But his intro and backing vocals with Billy Gibbons on \\"Burn The Witch\\", gives me the chills.  <br /> <br />Is it only me that can't hear Brody and Shirley at all on \\"You Got A Killer Scene There...Man\\", or have a I become deaf? <br /> <br />This is an album that I'm going to listen for so long that my neighbours probobly will make up plans to kill me, so that they won't have to hear it in the stairwell all the time.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool, one of the most creative and influential bands of recent years, is also one of the most controversial.  Their views on organized religion, expressed both subtly and not-so-subtly on past releases, are more than enough to cause a stir.  This is why this album, their fourth full-length studio release, is so surprising.  Not only has Tool toned down their former unholier than thou-ness, but they have also seemed to embrace, or at least acknowledge, spirituality.  Now before all you die-hard Maynard fanatics say what an ignorant barbarian I am for writing this, let me clear up a few things.  First off, I own \\"Opiate\\", \\"Undertow\\", and \\"AEnima\\", and am a huge fan of all three.  Just because \\"Lateralus\\" expresses a different opinion on certain issues than these other albums does not mean that Tool or any of its members have sold out.  On the contrary, it means that they have learned from their experiences and have developed new, and dare I say more mature, views on some matters.  \\"Lateralus\\" represents a new growth for Tool, not a compromise of standards or some commercial venture, and for this reason it has become one of my favorites.  As for the music itself, it is some of Tool's finest to date.  It includes the very popular classics \\"Schism\\" and \\"Parabol / Parabola\\", as well as unjustly neglected opuses such as \\"The Patient\\" and the title track.  Also included is the triad (consisting of \\"Disposition\\", \\"Reflection\\", and \\"Triad\\"), one of Tool's best pieces of work ever.  \\"The Grudge\\" is another great song, and the opening riff is powerful and extremely catchy.  My solitary complaint about the album is the song \\"Ticks and Leeches\\", which, while displaying a very good percussion aspect (as do most of the songs on every Tool CD), contains lyrical content that I just don't find appealing.  Despite this, the song is still extremely well-done.  The rest of the songs are pretty much intros, and they serve their purpose well.  Overall, \\"Lateralus\\" is an awesome Cd, and ishands down a must for any Tool, or simply good music, fan.  Thanks for reading.

B00009Z576|4.0|Ah, Drama.  The poor maligned runt of the Yes catalogue.  For years, Drama has been ignored by just about everyone including the band themselves.  The tour was legendarily bad, yet I saw it (Buffalo's now defunct Memorial Auditorium, Sept. 17, 1980) and it really wasn't THAT bad at all.  As for the record, it's not only not bad, it's pretty darn good.  \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are absolute classics that stand with anything the band ever recorded.<br /><br />Some \\"fans\\" may bemoan the fact that Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman aren't on it, yet Drama is light years ahead of the putrid dreck that was Tormato or the boring, uninspired Paris Sessions excerpted here as bonus tracks.  And Wakeman and Anderson are on those, so go figure.  In the late 70's-early 80's there was almost nothing left of the classic prog era.  Everyone had broken up (King Crimson) gone pop (Genesis) or was releasing garbage (ELP's Love Beach, Yes' Tormato etc.)  In this reviewer's opinion, Drama stands with the last best records of the era along with UK, Rush and a precious few others.<br /><br />So prog fans who've resisted Drama should put away all preconceptions and the negative junk you've heard and just listen-it would be a shame if so many potential fans continue to ignore this record.  Put on \\"Machine Messiah\\" and check out the band's renewed sense of passion and fire after the torpid Tormato.  Howe's near-metallic playing reminds one of Relayer in spots, and as soon as Trevor Horne starts to sing you'll breathe a sigh of relief.  It's a little different but it's still Yes and it's also a killer prog epic, one of Yes's best.<br /><br />The middle part of Drama is often acused of being \\"new wave\\" or \\"pop\\" but I've never heard new wave or pop sound quite like this.  The stunning musicianship and inventive arrangements are pure prog, it's just that the times and technology had changed, and the non-Anderson lyrics weren't as cryptic and mystical.  Yes had always used elements of pop in their music, in fact it was one of their secret weapons, and Drama just continues the tradition.<br /><br />Geoff Downes array of keyboards included some of the digital synths dreaded by prog purists, but prog was always about using new technologies, or those beloved analog synths would never have come into use in the first place!  Downes aquits himself well enough here for me to (temporarily) forgive him for Asia.<br /><br />Having seen the tour myself, I can say that Horne was probably more comfortable as a producer than fronting a world-famous band.  But he sings well on the album and is amply supported by Squire and Howe's harmonies.  If you've never heard it, you'll be surprised how much of the classic Yes sound depended on those harmonies rather than just Anderson's voice.<br /><br />And speaking of Chris Squire, bass fans will absolutely drool over his monster performances all over Drama.  Every song seems to be built around one of his killer riffs, and this may be the man's finest hour.  Want proof?  Check out \\"Tempus Fugit\\" which also features some \\"why didn't they think of that before\\" lyrics based around the band's name.  A glorious finish to a very good CD.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are a washout, with pointless studio rehearsals, bad jamming and the almost unlistenable \\"fabled\\" Paris Session excerpts.<br /><br />Prog fans should definitely get Drama.  Even if you don't like the middle, \\"Tempus Fugit\\" and \\"Machine Messiah\\" are essential.f pop in their music, in fact it was one of their secret weapons, and Drama just continues the tradition. <br /> <br />Geoff Downes array of keyboards included some of the digital synths dreaded by prog purists, but prog was always about using new technologies, or those beloved analog synths would never have come into use in the first place!

0440237688|5.0|The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is about a community that is much like Eutopia. In this community everything is either the same or picked for you. Everyone's job and spouse are picked by the elders, All colors are the same, and the weather never changes. When a kid named Jonas turns twelve he is chosen to become the next \\"Receiver of Memories\\". As he is going through the training to become the next \\"Receiver\\" he matures and he realizes that life isn't better if everyone is the same and that their spouses and their jobs are picked for them but that life is all about making their own choices and that things like colors and weather just make everything happening in life even better. Overall this book was great except that the ending kinda left you to imagine what happens and doesn't embellish on what happens.
B00005JLFC|5.0|I am neither a Barbra's fan nor particulalry romantic but this movie is definitively one of my top ten ever.  It got it all, period drama, adventure, comedie, song, fantastic sound track and.. love and friendship and how it can developp between people.  I saw this movie in my teens and it told me a one very important lesson for life : the \\"coup de foudre\\" does not exist !  Whatever is a person appearance true love cannot exist without understanding and meeting of the souls. <br />There is actually very few movies which explains why, this is one of them. <br />Enjoy !
B0000AUHPG|2.0|This is one of the most overrated, self-indulgent, slow-moving, and terribly written movies I've ever seen--and I consider myself a fan of Sergio Leone.  The scenes stretch to such interminable lengths that you almost wish that the bad guys could kill you to stop the torture.  Minimalistic dialogue and a simplistic plot (that is nonetheless very hard to follow) top off this travesty of cinema. I give it two stars based solely on the excellent cinematography, but the people responsible for the rest of this movie should have been dragged out into the desert and left for dead.  <br /> <br />Most importantly, the characters just don't sell.  Shooting a child early in the movie is not enough to make Henry Fonda a convincing villain, because he's still got that familiar and innocent face and voice.  Jason Robards could have been convincing, but his character--who has killed several people, runs an outlaw gang, and has a sizable bounty on his head--acts like a good samaritan for nearly the entire movie.  He is also played way too light-hearted for a supposedly gritty western.  Charles Bronson manages to pull off the mystique and menace of his character, but that incessant harmonica makes him seem like a cartoon character.  Hearing the same tortured melody for most of this lengthy movie is extremely annoying as well.  If I don't fly into a murderous rage the next time I hear a harmonica, it'll be a miracle.  Lastly, Claudia Cardinale has no depth at all in her character.  She also loses a lot of sympathy when she basically invites Jason Robards and his bunch to gang-rape her--because a hot bath will make her good as new--and soon after has a sex scene with the man who killed her husband.   <br /> <br />The actors in this may be screen legends, but the characters do not even begin to compare to the characters created by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Eli Wallach, and the other actors in the \\"Man With No Name\\" trilogy.  Those three movies are so far superior to this movie that they make this movie look like Leone's high-school project, rather than the masterwork that it has been called.  Obviously, opinions vary, but if you start feeling weary after the first half hour to forty-five minutes of this movie and grow anxious for it to pick up and get interesting--don't bother waiting.  If you turn it off right now, you can still avoid wasting the next two hours of your life.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This may not be the whole compilation of The Beatles' album, but this CD is suitable for those people who doesn't know The Beatles (I'm referring to the new generation people).  This CD will justify itself how did The Beatles became legendary in the music industry up until now.  The good thing about this CD is the booklet.  I'm very amazed about compiling different vinyl cover of each of their songs.  A must have album for a fan or a not-fan of The Beatles....
B00005UOKM|5.0|Many people mention this album in the same breath as Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch and Andrew Hill's Point of Departure, and true, the similarities are striking.  Both share much of the same personnel (Richard Davis being the man present on all occasions) and style, with elaborate, \\"structured-free\\" compositions, and very impressionistic soloing from all concerned.      That said, it's not the equal of Out to Lunch or Point of Departure...the themes are even more striking on those two, and the soloing is probably better.  So get those 2 first to really learn what the kind of exploratory, blending tradition with radicalism style of the 60's really was.  Once you have those, buy this.      This is really Andrew Hill's album in a way...most of the compositions (save 2 by drummer Chambers) are his, and while he has limited solo space you can see his touch over everything the others play.  Hubbard is in very fine form here, proving he could be as avant-garde as anyone else (he often, unfairly, is considered solely to be a \\"groove\\" trumpeter.)  Rivers only solos twice, but both solos (particularly his soprano) are two of the finest on record.  Hutcherson plays great, especially on the title track.  Joe Chambers is no Tony Williams, but he reminds you that he is one of the most underrated drummers in history.  As for the bassist, Richard Davis, he is very much the un-sung hero of this album, as well as \\"Departure\\" and \\"Lunch.\\"  His bass lines combine both walking and strumming, and add to the colorful mix, while also providing an anchor to hold it together.      For the musically daring lovers of jazz, this needs to be in your collection...place it third behind Out to Lunch and Point of Departure and you've got it made.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It's very hard to make a breakthrough in the music industry these days, but for Norah Jones - she's a lucky female artist who made it. No wonder that this CD had sold more or less, 19 million copies worldwide to date. I personally got interested immediately when I heard her song \\"Don't Know Why.\\" I bought her album, and thank God - you'll never regret if you bought this album. I love the way her music blends with her voice. Relaxing songs, simple, yet catchy. More power to you Norah Jones. Keep up the good work.... <br />

B000065VB0|5.0|I know that most people say that if you listen to \\"Solsbury Hill,\\" you'll hear why Peter Gabriel had to leave Genesis. I, however, feel that it was on his third solo album that Gabriel truly established himself as a solo artist. The penchant for musical exploration that we see on his first album is present on this one, as well as Gabriel's newly discovered fondness for disturbing subject matter and ethnic rock, first glimpsed on his second album. But here we have a more mature artist than the one we saw on the first two albums. Finally, there is a strong cohesion between the songs, a center of thematic unity. You should be warned: there isn't a single lighthearted moment on this album. Every single dark facet of the human mind, the shadowy recesses of the soul that everyone possesses to some degree (but doesn't like to think about), they are all explored throughout this album. But Gabriel's songwriting expertise actually manages to make the experience an engaging one.    The opening song, Intruder, makes it clear that we're entering a dark world. In true Peter Gabriel fashion, it's a bizarre opener, albeit a bit darker than what we're used to. But still, Gabriel uses his powers of composition to make it delightful, in a sick way. The disjointed, yet solid melody, coupled with Gabriel's treatment of the lyrics (muttering one moment, crying out the next, with just the right amount of feedback to give his voice a more shadowy quality) reel the listener in. One almost gets a sense that Gabriel has assumed the role of the stalker almost too well. It's enough to raise the hairs on the back of your neck, and yet, it's artistic enough to grab your attention. It's not the last time Gabriel sings in the first person. In the following song, No Self-Control, he assumes the role of an obsessed man, again with frightening accuracy. And as in the last song, the music only heightens the unease. The driving percussion (expertly provided by Gabriel's old Genesis buddy, Phil Collins),combined with the sudden, bursting guitar riffs almost become a rhythmic, impulsive chant. He also plays the role of amnesiac in I Don't Remember, a song made even more terrifying by the fact that Gabriel might be suggesting that society itself, and the drives to conform, are the reasons that we have lost our identities. And in this song, we also hear Gabriel drifting further into modern rock than he has before, with outstanding results.     In addition to moments of artistic funk rock, we are also given hints of the direction Gabriel will go for the rest of his solo career. We hear African soul influences in the percussion throughout. Sometimes, as in Lead a Normal Life, it's keyed down. Or, by contrast, you have the vivid, multilayered percussion of Games Without Frontiers, a chilling song about how people are subconsciously conditioned to fight wars as adults through the games they play as children, complete with eerie backing vocals from singer Kate Bush (who would work with Gabriel again). We hear soft pop traces within the tragic beauty of Family Snapshot (a profile of a murderer, or a suggestion that said murderer is, to some degree, every man?), which is probably the one time on the album Gabriel is blatantly TRYING to make the listener cry. We hear modern jazz-rock within the sad reflective tones of Start, an instrumental consisting only of a keyboard synthesizer, bass, and sax. Gabriel is still exploring, but through the darkness of the subject matter, we get a unifying theme. We get Gabriel's penchant for experimentation (with a more solid focus), and through songs like I Don't Remember, Family Snapshot and Lead a Normal Life, we also get an idea of the direction Gabriel wanted his career to take during the 1980s.     Finally, after the dark, brooding journey through the bleak recesses of the mind, Gabriel ends the song on a surprising note: Biko, an anti-apartheid song dealing with the murder of South African civil rights leader Steven Bantu Biko, and how his death only strengthened his cause by making him a martyr (\\"the man is dead, and the eyes of the world are watching now\\"). The song is rich, insightful, and spiritually uplifting. The influences of African music on Gabriel shine through in both the music and the vocals. Gabriel embraces them, honors them while also giving them his own stamp, and the end result is one of the most beautiful, poignant songs of his career. It's also interesting to note that this song got the distribution of Gabriel's music banned from South Africa for many years.     If one listens to this album, one will hear the real reason Peter Gabriel left Genesis. Gabriel matured as both a solo artist and a songwriter on this album, stepping light-years beyond his progressive roots, while at the same time doing them justice. The album is bleak, insightful, disturbing, shocking, delightful, morbid, and beautiful all at the same time. While Gabriel would go on to prove his expertise as a pop artist during the 80s, nothing else he would do for the rest of his career would measure up to the richness he displays on this album. There's a very good reason critics and fans consider this his masterpiece, and through it, Gabriel established himself as one of the best modern artists of our time.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Hm..what comes to mind when I think of Simple Plan, whiney bitches is a start, complete rock and/or punk posers is another thing. If I am ever forced to listen to \\"Perfect,\\" again I am getting a gun and taking hostages..for the record. I can think of nothing more suiting then death for these guys, something I think they merit ten-fold. I wish these guys, Good Charolette, Yellowcard, and the lot, would just stop, or at least stop trying to come off all hardcore. These bands are whiney, wimpy, poser bands, they aren't rock, they CERTAINLY AREN'T punk, so stop calling them that,  it just makes you sound like a douche bag who spends too much time in the mall.
B00005K9LN|5.0|First I want to briefly discuss Killing Machine (known as Hell Bent for Leather in the US) and then move on to British Steel, so please bear with me...I heard both records for the first time late in 1984 or early in 1985 when I was 16 years old and new to the metal scene...      Killing Machine was a great record, it was released in 1978 and was Priest's first experiment with their new stripped-down sound, shorter songs and more direct lyrics.  As such, while individual songs on Killing Machine were great (actually they nearly all were), the album had a very experimental feel to it, and you felt that still better was to come.    British Steel was released two years after Killing Machine, and you felt the band had matured a lot and grown heaps in self-confidence.  The live album Unleashed In The East kept the fans' interest in the band alive throughout 1979.  Another change took place before British Steel was recorded, with Les Binks being replaced by Dave Holland on drums (sadly incarcerated now for sex offences - forvever remembered in my mind for the drum intro on Riding On The Wind).  The heart and soul of the band, Rob Halford on vocals, KK Downing and Glenn Tipton on guitars and Ian Hill on bass, remained in place for British Steel.      What can I say about British Steel itself?  I loved it, I just loved the overall sound that they managed to produce.  It was similar to Killing Machine in basic style, sound and direction, but there was more of the feeling of the songs being linked together as a complete package.  The sound was still raw, but it was slightly more polished, and by the time Vengeance came out in 1982 they would head further in the direction of a polished sound.  Halford's voice is at its best on British Steel, authoritative, powerful, passionate, able to hit the very low and high notes, and suitably aggressive in the right places.    The album starts with Rapid Fire, a speed metal track ahead of its time, that just keeps on keeping on as the words and riffs just continue unabated, with not much variation in the tone, just a grinding repetitive rythmn, and no sign of an identifiable chorus either.  It's a similar opener to Delivering The Goods on Killing Machine, but in this case I feel the Killing Machine opener is better, but not by much.      Metal Gods is anthemnic in nature with the powerful chorus of Metal Gods, backed up by the dragging of chains sound effect that occurs at the same time as the main riff, and its timing and volume mixed in with the regular guitar sound is just perfect, and chilling in its effectiveness.  The chains sound is not too loud or too buried.  The subject matter - which I didn't realise back in the day (no lyrics came with the album) - is about security cameras, as on the song Electric Eye.      Grinder is a standard, fairly slow, menacing and brooding heavy number.  The main riff of this song and Creeping Death by Metallica seem somehow similar to me.  However, to my knowledge no-one else has ever said this, now or then, so maybe I'm missing something.      United is a sing-along fun anthemn (Take on the World Part II), focusing on the togetherness and unity of metal fans back then, which is sadly (in my opinion) much lesser nowdays cos the genre has split up into thrash, death, black, melodic death, metalcore. etc. and many people are interested only in one or two of the sub-genres.  So the early to mid 1980s were really a unique time in metal history, and United sums up the feeling of the times well.  Back in the 1980s, metal was metal, and those that loved Motley Crue also loved Slayer and Metallica.  Yes, the song was cheesy but think what Queen was doing back then.      On the original LP version, Living After Midnight kicked off side two with a bang.  A great song, more commercially oriented, but its still definitely Priest in character and heart (in my opinion).  It has so much energy and simplicity, and just simply rocks.      I was in a cafe in the entertainment district of Perth, Australia called Northbridge with a Canadian friend (Mark R.) one Sunday night two years ago.  We both found out, almost stumbling upon it by accident, that we were two 80s metalheads in hiding.  20 seconds later we were both singing the words of Living After Midnight!        So I think this is the best Priest record.  The title says it all.  It summarised what Priest were all about - reliable, trustworthy, tough, unashamedly patriotic, resolute, cheerful.  I'm glad they didn't call the album Living After Midnight and make that song the title track.  British Steel sums up best what the band were all about circa 1980.    FOOTNOTE (added 9 June 2006): I have noticed on certain internet chat forums, it has become cool among some people to bash this record, and heap praise on all the Priest records that came before it and after it.  This is just re-writing history in my opinion.  Back in the day the vast majority of fans loved British Steel, and regarded it as a positive move forward for the band.  It should also be noted that whilst Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight are not bad songs at all, they are not representative of the album taken as a whole.

B00003CWTI|4.0|\\"Magnolia\\" is a long sad movie about walking wounded and human fragility featuring intricate plotting (an interwoven set of storylines from a large cast that's been compared to Altman) excellent acting (Anderson's cokeheads all always REALLY coked out) relevant topics (The Men's Movement whose importance I predict will unfold across decades is finally addressed in Tom Cruise's star turn as a charismatic misogynist), sweetly melancholic music (which rekindled Aimee Mann's career), and a sure directorial hand.  But what everyone wants to know is:  Why does it rain frogs in the middle of the film seemingly apropos of nothing?? <br /> <br />An absurdist statement of randomness?  The frogs rain hard, thudding into windshields, seeming even to pop and bleed.  It's one of the most arresting sequences in recent cinema.  What gives?  I think they're about accountability.  These characters' suffering (from estrangement, pressure, addiction, disease) is caused less by circumstances than by other people.  Where there are victims, there are victimizers, and many of them are human.  When the Egyptians enslaved and exploited the Israelites, God sent a series of plagues:  Locusts, flies, and, yes, frogs rained upon the land.  Anderson may be suggesting that if we don't respect each other, a divine retribution may be lurking. <br /> <br />Or maybe I ate too much paste in kindergarten.
630463949X|5.0|This is one of the best 5 live performances I ever saw on DVD and believe me , I've seen many. <br />Without Christine it's not the same , and here you have her! <br />unlike the Boston show in 2003 where she is missing and so are her songs (Everywhere and You Make Loving Fun...) <br />Don't worry , It's all HERE!!!!!!!! <br />her voice is so mellow , so relaxing.WOW! <br />Stevie does her job pretty good as usual. <br />MIck on drums is fantastic with the crazy look in his eyes :) <br />Lindsey ofcourse with \\"So afraid\\" - great guitar and vocals. <br />and finally , John Mcvie On Bass , especially on TUSK!!!! <br />I always thought the better DVD's of live performances would be from later years (technology , sound , picture etc.....). <br />Well guess what ? I WAS WRONG! <br />Maybe The Boston Show has a clearer picture and ofcourse the widescreen technology , but this one is so much better. <br />BUY THIS ONE.
B00006879E|2.0|The Depth and the Shallows.  Music that will past the test of time.  Music that will not.  I thought that \\"This Love\\" was the catchiest song ever.  A fusion of alt rock and dance funk with a razor sharp hook, \\"This Love\\" got turned up whenever it hit my radio.  Well, it hasn't aged well, and it sounds shallow and irritating at this point.  Ditto for the infectious \\"Harder to Breathe.\\"  And I never really cared for \\"She Will Be Loved.\\"  It's packed with cliches, which ruin its soaring attractive melody. <br /> <br />This is a band that has been undone by its videos.  Sure, they're slick and professional, but the lead singer comes across with egoistic swagger.  Models glom onto him; clearly, he thinks he's the shiz-nit.  News flash:  Your voice is thin and nasal and your body is very average.  The guy moves as though he sings like Jeff Buckley and looks like Tyson Beckford.   <br /> <br />Give me the quirky individual anyday:  Prince, Tori Amos, Rufus Wainwright, Joss Stone over this Chili Peppers Lite.  Straight white males are clearly running out of things to say and subcultures to plunder.  Ick.

0446677450|4.0|I would have given this book 3 stars for being theory-heavy, but it earns a 4th because it does motivate one to seek out different means of income streams. <br />Mr. Kiyosaki, in so many words, says this: The world's about assets vs. liabilities.  Build your asset column until it equals or surpasses your liabilities (or expenses), and you will have a sound base toward becoming rich.  And he's absolutely right, provided you get your assets to that point.   <br />Otherwise he hints at a few pieces of asset-building ventures which I believe are best left to upper middle-class and wealthy folks (1031s, etc). <br />His greatest point: THE NEED TO TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT FINANCIAL COMPETENCE AT AN EARLY AGE.  Nothing more can be stressed except that, I'd say.  He said it right...just because you're highly educated doesn't mean you'll be rich.  You do have to be savvy, though. <br />Worth reading.

B000005J08|5.0|As I write this, its been 16 years since these recordings were originally released, and remarkably, they still sound 10 years ahead of their time.  One of many high peaks in John Zorn's career, \\"Naked City\\" (both this album and the project) stand, to my ears, pretty much on their own.    Zorn assembled a monster band, featuring himself on alto sax, Bill Frisell on guitar, Fred Frith on bass, Wayne Horvitz on keys, and Joey Baron on drums.  This group is joined on several tracks by vocalist Yamataka Eye as they explore, well everything, musically.  The accomplishments on this record are stunning.  Tackling material by Morriconi, Henry Mancini, Ornette Coleman, Jerry Goldsmith, John Barry (\\"The James Bond Theme\\") and a series of Zorn originals, the band moves genres effortlessly.    The opener on the album pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the record-- \\"Batman\\" begins with a crazed guitar figure, then moves underneath a wailing sax to a driving rhythm and backbeat, maintains this sort of pseudo-swing feel but structures itself such that it occasionally collapses into hard core noise.  The band proves themselves capable of extraordinary beauty (\\"The Sicilian Clan\\") and noise (the entire middle of the album-- all hardcore songs under a minute featuring Eye), sometimes all in the same song (\\"Snagglepuss\\").  I once heard someone say, \\"if you don't like Naked City, wait ten seconds, it'll sound completely different\\", and its really quite accurate.  Whats stunning is that zorn manages such that swing fits next to hardcore fits next to country & western, then slinks into \\"The James Bond Theme\\".    When I first heard this recording, I'd never heard anything like it before, and I never expect that I will hear anything like it-- this music requires a certain level of fearlessness (and probably a healthy dose of bravado) combined with virtuoso performers who are willing (and capable) of expressing themselves in any form.  But really, in order to pull this off, both thecomposer and the musicians have to know when to let loose and have fun-- when serious is too serious, and John Zorn does know this.    Probably one of the most important things to remember about this album is that it really bears repeated listens-- there's a lot here, I've pretty much played it nonstop since I first heard it, and I'm still finding new and exciting moments in it.  But I know people who didn't \\"get it\\" at first, and eventually, it sunk in and made sense.  Give it a try or two or three, skip anything that really bothers you and come back to it later, this is not easy music, but it is brilliant and highly rewarding.    If you are a fan of unique, creative, improvised, or just downright interesting music, you owe it to yourself to check out this recording.

B000002B2T|5.0|Some of the most creative, lyrical, and tightest-sounding grunge is on this album.  From start to finish, I can give it no less than 5 stars. <br /> <br />It is perhaps fitting that this one-time band made only one album.  This album is nearly peerless.  It is also not well known and after you listen to it you'll be thankful for that. <br /> <br />If you have sweet memories of the day, you will find, as I do, that this album is powerful and brings you right back.  It is what the best of the grungers made then, and would be making today had they not blown up.  <br /> <br />Discover it for yourself and see if you out grow it in 10 years.  It's been that long for me and I'm still captivated by Mad Season.
B00000ILDF|3.0|Alien 3 is not bad considering Alien 4 and certainly AVP. It is the third best in the series but to be honest why Box Set? I own all by accident of a present, but I would rather get \\"Aliens\\" and then \\"Alien\\" and then \\"Alien 3\\", stopping there, although true fans will say owning Alien 3 is even pushing it, but there are some things that still make Alien 3 interesting. This is the first CGI alien. It is a David Fincher movie. It is the first hybrid alien suggesting that the face hugger mixes the victim's DNA with the alien DNA to produce a new type of hybrid alien (even the originals are human developments). That concept was again played out in Alien 4: Resurrection and Alien Vs Predator but to a lesser effect and certainly with less grasp over why it was there in Alien 3. Ripley is back, but not as per the tagline in the poster. It may have been Weaver herself who is ultimately responsible for a toned down Alien, but there was pressure to develop an Alien without guns. Alien 3 went through several drafts and edits before this final version was chosen. Most of us think that Fincher would have probably produced a much better Alien 3 if the studio and cast let him do his thing. Ripley is really a shadow of her former self in this, although the acting on all counts is better than the others maybe, it still leaves much to be desired in the action department, but can we blame Fincher for an Alien 3 without action? I think not. So Fincher gives us a brainy idea, prison on a remote planet, Ripley's pod crashes there and an alien gets loose in the complex, there is only one alien. You can watch Alien 3 but I would hold back on buying it if you do not own the first two. If you have then do you really want to push your alien collection? A Fincher collection is why I would own it.

B000069HK2|5.0|SIMPLE. THE USED = THE BEST BAND TO PLAY MUSIC. They have become mainstream lately, but I was backing them a long time ago. This cd is really amazing, and raw. You can almost feel the time, effort, and pure emotion the put into this album, and you can tell how much The Used loves music. The Used single handedly inspires all the music I write, and Jeph is an AMAZING bassist. They're second cd is pure genius, no doubt about it, but it does not compare to the first.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|It took me 5 or 6 times to really get in the flow of this album, but after I let go of the fact that's it's quite different from their previous efforts, I'm finding a breadth of familar Queens and some great new sounds. The excellent lyrics and vocals of Tangled Up In Plaid and Broken Box, and the catchy guitar riffs of In My Head and Little Sister are just some of what I've dug so far. Good stuff.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I saw Big Fish in the theaters 3 times; it was just that compelling to me. A couple people I know didn't really care for it, and some liked it, so liking this movie means having a certain aesthetic taste, but regardless, Big Fish can really be appreciated for its incredible artistic presence, whatever your tastes.  <br /> <br />The dialectic back-and-forth between story and real-life is a powerful element in this movie, and the cinematography really fleshes out the fictional scenes to great effect.  <br /> <br />One thing I love about Tim Burton is his symbolism. All the imagination he puts into his movies really come through because you can see and feel the symbolism in what happens to the characters and in the style of the scene or how everything looks, and watching Big Fish, I just felt like his depictions of certain sensitivities to life and emotions were so RIGHT. His artistic metaphors, like Ewan McGregor getting entrapped by an eery Snow-White-esque tree, realizing this isn't the way he dies, and then abruptly plummeting from the tree's ensnarings, that's just brilliant, I mean, you're watching something totally unreal happening but you couldn't feel closer to what it means.  <br /> <br />In addition the characters are great, they are acted out with nice charisma and charm, and the running theme of the movie has to do with story-telling and imagination itself - so fundamental and ~SO~ good.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|DVDs that force one to watch previews are among the biggest annoyances of modern life. I seldom put in this DVD, simply because I know I'll be forced to sit through the same previews again. Universal, the company that made this, should seriously consider that it's creating all sorts of anger among customers, and that people subjected to this idiocy will go out of their way to avoid the company's products in the future (I plan to boycott Univeral's DVDs until this practice is changed). If it realizes this, it will remove previews from its offerings - they're sure to hurt its profits more than help. As for me, I'd like a refund, please.

630469878X|3.0|This modern flip on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining thrill ride through the American southwest. Thelma and Louise's escapades were quite liberating for them, as they were two women held down by typical society's constraints. Both women were trapped in their lives as a housewife and a waitress, who had nowhere to go. They had never lived a life of much excitement, especially Thelma with her overprotective husband. The two women start their liberation small, with Thelma not telling her husband she'll be gone for the weekend and the end with things like murder and armed robbery. The film is a great example of how women are equally capable of anything men can do. In this case it just happens to be violent crime, something that men are much more associated with. <br /> Many have argued that the film is not actually liberating to women, because of all the male chauvinist elements of the film. Elements like condescending down talk towards the women and how the men seemingly win in the end (they don't get to Mexico, etc.). In my opinion all of these elements actually contribute to the film be liberating to women. How the women are talked about and treated in the film actually works in their favor, because in the end they do things on their terms, not the men's. For example the women don't get to Mexico, but they aren't captured either. They go out on their terms, by driving off the cliff. Another example is how they are constantly referred to as `girls' by the police, portray the police's opinion of them as very lowly and not dangerous. When in fact they prove to be quite dangerous and capable it makes the police seem stupid, because they underestimated them. In conclusion this is the story of two women's liberated journey across the country in an attempt to find their true selves. <br />
0312330529|5.0|You might say I'm in love with this book. I clearly see its shortcomings, but I adore it nevertheless. It's a vast, gorgeous story with memorable characters and a setting so well described that I feel as though I've lived there. Many chapters dance and writhe with more joy and pain than many novels do in their entirety. Yes, that's partly because it's a ridiculous 900 pages long, but it's also because the author is writing from his own life experience and tells the story with palpable passion. That is the book's weakness and also its strength.  The author holds nothing back in the telling of the story, so the writing feels unrestrained and is rarely succinct. The author gushes about a lover's lips to the point of embarassment and peppers every page with a distracting number of adjectives and commas. The frequent digressions and philosophical musings feel ponderous as often as they seem enlightening. But the sheer vitality of the story along with the force of the author's joys and sorrows are so convincing that these shortcomings often seem as substantial as dust motes. Perhaps I even love \\"Shantaram\\" more because of them. <br /> <br />Final note: If for no other reason, you should read this book in order to meet one of the most endearing characters ever brought to life in a novel--a man by the name of Prabaker.
B000089CJI|1.0|Why does this entire album make me want to dig up and blast early Metallica like \\"Kill em All\\", which I haven't listened to in years? Why does listening to the incredibly dull, sappy, syrupy sweet \\"Sleeping In\\" give me visions of Iggy Pop, half naked and screaming, charging onto the stage, tearing the microphone away, kicking the drum machines over and howling \\"Now I want to be your dog!\\" \\"Natural Anthem\\" is the best of the batch, until the ponderous singing kicks in toward the end, seemingly oblivious to the rhythm of the song. It completely defuses the building intensity of the first 3 or 4 minutes, and ultimately sounds more or less like the lyrics in every other song, with the same lack of dynamism and energy. It's like an academic exercise. On the whole, the writing is pretentious instead of poetic, the music is clever but dull, the whole thing is \\"a mess\\" as one reviewer put it. Not recommended.
0743506650|4.0|(Memoir / instruction) King gives a memoir of  how he became a writer and a great deal of  instruction on how to become a better writer  yourself, especially focused on fiction but - I  think - capable of being generalized.

Potentially offensive material: lots of strong language

B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is rock & roll man! This album is also a bastard. Literally. To be more refined, two songs are from High Voltage, the group's first album, and the other seven are TNT, their second album. But who should worry? It rocks! Angus is still young so he ain't as amazing, but for meaty licks and riffs, it's the best of its kind. Malcolm provides some weird backing vocals, from the growling of Live Wire to the robotic drone of the title track. And Bon is in top form. Love the pipes of Long Way. <br /> <br />The goodies: <br /> <br />It's A Long Way To The Top: Bon rocks and the mike with his nic fit voice and bagpipes! The meat on the riff is excellent. <br /> <br />The Jack: The ultimate double entendre song. This song's extra bluesy. <br /> <br />Live Wire: Pumping bass and cool lyrics highlight this one. <br /> <br />TNT: OY! OY! Need I say more. Another meaty riff. <br /> <br />Little Lover: Groovy little metal blues number. <br /> <br />High Voltage: Classic r&r anthem. Great guitar and grwat Bon vocals. <br /> <br />Other albums were more metal and more serious, in fac t here they were called a novelty act. But its classic. Definately high voltage, definetely punk.
B00000272N|5.0|The very first time I heard Man In The Box I was just blown away because I'd never heard anything like it and it was a breath of fresh air, I mean I was just tired of all of those stupid 80s Glam bands that were ruling the music industry. I fell in love with the dark side of this album and I still listen to it today. Its just a timeless album that will have you straight up rocking until the very last song.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is one of very few CDs that I could put into my CD player and put on repeat without ever getting tired of it.  As a matter of fact, this is my favourite album of all time, definitely the best RATM produced.  They took things that were already out there, and they refined them, and improved on them.  They fused rap and rock, and imbued it with a great and eloquently-worded message.  Challenge authority, look at what's going on around you, they said.   <br /> <br />Each member brought something great to the band.  Tim and Brad gave it a foundation, with great bass riffs and solid drumming, and then added onto that were probably the greatest guitarist since the days of Hendrix and Page (Tom), and the most angry, passionate singer since... I don't even know who...  <br /> <br />Almost every track on the album is amazing.  I could do a track by track breakdown but there's not enough space for me to say how great I think this album is.  The only track I don't outright love is \\"Settle For Nothing,\\" and that's only because it's a downbeat, introspective track, smack dab in the middle of loud, angry rock. I can't even really pick favourites from among the rest.  \\"Take The Power Back\\" probably has my favourite solo, and \\"Freedom\\"'s got my favorite opening. <br /> <br />Aside from that, all I can say is \\"BUY THIS ALBUM!\\" I've bought it a few times over the years, due to losing the CD or having friends get it scratched, and I've never regretted spending the money.   <br /> <br />Oh, and I wanted to end with something I think is important.  People say that RATM are (or were, worst day of my year when they broke up) hypocritical because they were on Sony's Epic label.  As far as that goes, you really can't do better than hear it straight from guitarist Tom Morello himself: <br /> <br /> \\"A lot of labels contacted us, and lots of them just didn't seem to understand what we wanted to do.  They kept talking about the message of the music as a gimmick. They were interested in usjust because  there was a buzz... They saw us as the latest local rock band to be hyped. But Epic agreed to everything we asked--and they've followed through... we never saw a conflict as long as we maintained creative control. When you live in a capitalistic society, the currency of the dissemination of information goes through capitalistic channels. Would Noam Chomsky object to his works being sold at Barnes & Noble? No, because that's where people buy their books. We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists, but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from Granada Hills to Stuttgart.\\" <br /> <br />So there you have it. You snooty RATM haters can get off your high horse now, thank you very much. Not only are they great musicians, but they are well-read too.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|qotsa return with quite possibly their best album to date with lullabies to paralyze. this album is a little more brooding than previous releases with some bluesy guitar riffs and repeated choruses. there is the radio hit \\"little sister\\" and other outstanding tracks like \\"burn the witch\\" (a little help from zz top axeman), and others like \\"everybody knows you're insane\\". this album is best listened to at night while dark riffs and wicked songs display the queens best whole album.  lullabies gets better with repeated listens and stands out of their previous releases. dave grohl's drumming is missed and where is that bass player? it doesn't matter too much, it's excellent on it's own.
B00005ATQF|4.0|A lot of people complain that the movie doesn't portray the Vietnam war accurately. It's understandable--it's hard to suspend disbelief enough to even accept that someone as weak as Lawrence, the broken recruit who kills the drill sergeant, would get through boot camp in the first place. But I think the movie is more about psychological reality than physical, historical accuracy. In this aspect, the film succeeds. The main character Joker's naivete, compassion, cowardice, cruelty, inexperience, and bravado are beautifully mixed into a coherent whole of a human being who seeks even when those around him no longer have the strength to think.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's best album ever. The others are good. With this one, however, she is more comfortable in the delivery of the words and vocals. The music and her vocals accompany each other flawlessly. It is a spiritual journey of sorts. I just love to listen to this one while on the computer. I mostly listen to it from beginning to end. It is in my cd player often. A must for any fan and a must for any one interested in music. 'Ray Of Light', is enlightening, soothing, touching and it will make you want to dance. Every song is a highlight on this cd. Enjoy!! <br />

B0007P3582|4.0|The Massacre: 4.5/5    Damn!!! 50 CENT'S, THE MASSACRE, IS HOT! It's not as hot as Get Rich or Die Tryin', but it's hot! It definately wasn't a massacre to listen to it. 50 Cent makes almost all of this album's beats really nice. It will get your head banging, unless you're not a fan of 50 Cent! I DON'T KNOW WHY THE HELL MAD PEOPLE BE HATIN' ON THE MASSACRE, BUT I LOVE IT! Damn, this album sold 1.1 million copies in its first week, so I recommend you get this album. I couldn't even wait for 50's 2nd LP to drop after I heard his club banger, \\"Disco Inferno,\\" and then I saw his overplayed video, \\"Candy Shop!\\" After The Game's, The Documentary dropped, I knew that The Massacre was gonna be hotter than that. By the way, I got The Massacre a week ago. There are 21 tracks on this album. Here's my ratings of 50 Cent's, The Massacre:      - In My Hood- I love this track because it's a good way to start off The Massacre. The beat to this track is hot, and it sounds like it's a 1990's beat. 8.5/10    - This is 50- This track is wack! I usually skip this. 5/10    - I'm Supposed To Die Tonight- I like this track because of the production and chorus. It's a slow and hot beat produced by Eminem. It's also one of my favorites off The Massacre. 9/10    - Piggy Bank- This track is alright. I don't really like it anymore because it's pretty worthless since Jadakiss came back with some good disses to 50 on \\"Checkmate\\" and Fat Joe got on him with a song. The beat is hot though. 7/10    - Gatman and Robbin' feat. Eminem- I like this track a little. Eminem comes on hard, but I don't like the beat of this track. 7.5/10    - Candy Shop feat. Olivia- Come on now! You know this love hit is overplayed and been hot for a month now! It's alright! 8/10    - Outta Control- This track has great production. I like this track though, and it's one of my favorites off the Massacre! 9/10    - Get In My Car- This track is sick. I like the beat to it. 8/10    - Ski Mask Way- This is pretty hot. I like the beat, and it's serious. 7.5/10    - A Baltimore Love Thing- This track pretty hot, but it's funny. 7.5/10    - Ryder Music- This is impressive, and you sure could ride to it. I like the calm and slow beat produced by Dr. Dre. 8/10    - Disco Inferno- Oh yea, I love this hit fo' sho'! It's close to being like an \\"In Da Club.\\" It's one of my favorites off of The Massacre. 10/10    - Just A Little Bit- OH YEA, I LOVE THIS HIT FO' SHO'! The production of this track is nice. This is produced by Dre. Another one of my favorites off The Massacre. 10/10    - Gunz Come Out- DAMN!!!! THIS TRACK IS SERIOUS! I'M TELLING YOU!! I recommend you listen to this hit. It's produced by Dre, and it's my favorite off of The Massacre! 10/10    - My Toy Soilder feat. Tony Yayo- This is a hot track. It has nice production, and Tony Yayo comes on it hard. 8.5/10    - Position of Power- I think this track is hot. 7.5/10    - Build You Up feat. Jamie Foxx- I love this track. It's another one of my favorites off of The Massacre. 9/10    - God Gave Me Style- I think this track is pretty hot. 8/10    - So Amazing feat. Olivia- I think this track is pretty hot. 7.5/10    - I Don't Need 'Em- The last track on The Massacre is alright, but it's a slow beat.     - Hate It or Love It feat. G-Unit- The bonus track off of The Massacre is alright. It includes the whole G-Unit. 8/10      50 Cent doesn't rap too nice on The Massacre. Obviously, almost 50's whole album is mad hot! Like I said, I recommend you go cop The Massacre.     DAMN!!!

B0007QJ1N4|1.0|For months now, notorious control freak Josh Homme has been heralding the return to rock via the new Queens of the Stone Age album that was released this past Tuesday.  In article after article, Homme would extole the virtues of the cowbell, talk about the swelling sexy, and make it seem like \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" would single-handedly save music from the likes of Britneys and American Idols.  But for all Josh's hype, he doesn't deliver.  Most of the songs on LTP seem to just be rehashes of the best (and sometimes worst) of other QOTSA albums.  The second song, \\"Medication,\\" sounds exactly like \\"Regular John\\" from their first self-titled.  There are familiar guitar licks and chords phrasings throughout.  And please, can he not come up with a better chorus than \\"Everybody Knows You Are Insane.\\"  I almost wrecked my car when Track 6 \\"in My Head Came On\\" - this track was already released - almost identically - as \\"In My Head...Or Something\\" less than two years ago on Josh's side project, Desert Sessions 9 & 10.  So he's not able to write enough new songs, he has to just repeat himself?  Or he couldn't have just cut this song?  There's already fourteen tracks anyway.  Really, there's only like one good song on this album, I think it's either Track 9 or 10 but I can't remember because they all just kind of blend into one another.  I haven't even watched the DVD yet - I can't believe I actually paid $20 for this album (and had it not be onsale, it would've cost $27).  I think Josh Homme is very talented - I love his other 3 QOTSA albums and his side projects.  I was amazed when I saw QOTSA on tour for \\"Songs For The Deaf.\\"  And that's why LTP is such a big disappointment.  SFTD set the bar so high, and despite all the talk, QOTSA hasn't delivered on this one.  Josh should beg Mark Lanegan (who appears only on the lackluster opening track), Nick Oliveri (um, how is it a Queens album without Nick's desperate, screaming songs at this point?), and Dave Grohl (no one drums better) to come back and create something amazing again.  Or he should just stick to drumming in Eagles of Death Metal.  Because this album is boring.etter) to come back and create something amazing again.  Or he should just stick to drumming in Eagles of Death Metal.  Because this album is boring.
B00000AF98|4.0|To be honest, I really hated \\"Crazy Night\\" when I first heard it. After a few listens, however, it has grown on me. It's not one of their best albums (even from their 80s output) but it's still a fine album.<br /><br />It's no secret that since \\"Dynasty,\\" KISS has often embraced the current sound of what is hip for the day. In the late 70s it was disco pop (Dynasty, Unmasked), in the mid 90s it was grunge (Carnival Of Souls), and in the late 80s it was pop-metal with \\"Crazy Nights.\\" But even if KISS has not always been original, they have, for the most part, always put out good albums. KISS has always had the gift for following a trend, but still make it sound like KISS. KISS's stab at pop-metal works out nicely with this tight, solid collection of songs. One thing that I like about this album is that although it's very slick and has a very glossy production, it's also somewhat dark, as song titles like \\"I'll Fight Hell to Hold You,\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" would suggest. This makes for an interesting contrast.<br /><br />The KISS lineup of this album was Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Carr, and Bruce Kulick. Paul Stanley has always been one of rock's more underrated singer/songwritters. The albums' highlights' are the Stanley numbers. And his delivery sounds as passionate as ever, especially in the magnificent \\"I'll Fight Hell to Hold You\\" and the mid-tempo \\"Reason to Live,\\" two of the albums' highlights.  The Simmon's songs aren't quite as strong, but are still solid, especially the closing track \\"Thief in the Night.\\" Guitarist Bruce Kulick may not have been as technically gifted or as flashy as Vinnie Vincent or Mark St. John, but he was still a great guitarist. His solos throughout \\"Crazy Night\\" are awesome, yet are not over-the-top or self-indulgent. Eric Carr's drumming is exciting and dynamic and gives the songs an added kick.<br /><br />This CD has a good pace and is about 45 minutes in length. There isn't a whole lot of filler. Some of the songs sound very dated and are somewhat embarrassing-- \\"Bang Bang You,\\" and \\"No No No\\" for example, but even those are fun songs with good, albeit cheesy sing along choruses. All of the songs on \\"Crazy Nights\\" have catchy hooks and strong melodies--which ultimately makes the CD a winner. And, as mentioned previously, beneath the gloss and slickness, there is an element of darkness which gives an edginess to the album, which separates \\"Crazy Nights\\" from other albums of the pop-metal genre.<br /><br />In conclusion, although \\"Crazy Nights\\" isn't all that original, or the best KISS album, it's still a good CD. If you are a KISS fan and hate this album, I would suggest giving it another spin with an open mind and you may gain a fresh perspective.ound very dated and are somewhat embarrassing-- \\"Bang Bang You,\\" and \\"No No No\\" for example, but even those are fun songs with good, albeit cheesy sing along choruses.

B0006IIKS0|1.0|Good GOD!! Is it possible that Lars Ulrich could possibly be as in reality as much of a materialistic, immature, spoiled cretin as it appears in this painfully long and banal documentary?????? He is an embarassement to the Danish people! As an amateur drummer I can tell you...he is much less prolific than most pre-teen speed metal drummers I run into in the local Guitar Center!!

These cats are spaced out, man... like, you know, they're speeding... groovy man! Isn't it far out? f@ckin' A, man!  <br />This DVD is a must have. A piece of archive. Every time I watch it I think of the people who might recognize themselves, especially those who were only kids at the time, cos I'm about their age. We're all the Woodstock generation in one way or another. A beautiful movie, about beautiful people. You're gonna dig it too!
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath invented heavy metal. Their 1970 self-titled debut is a classic, and I listen to it every day. This album, however is even better. In fact, it's THE best Sabbath album. The best song here is Children of the Grave. Other great songs include Solitude, Into The Void, and Sweet Leaf. I also beleve this album started Stoner Rock. If you listen to Sweet Leaf, you'll know what I mean. All the songs rock, but the above mentioned are my favorites.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1. Sweet Leaf 5/5<br /><br />2.

B00063EMJ6|4.0|Not the definitive collection of his works by any means, but a fair representation of his most accessible works. Even casual Neil Young fans will recognize many of his classics here and there are almost no \\"weak points\\" in this collection of 1970s to early 1990s Young tunes. <br /> <br />There are some noticeable gaps but this is not the \\"Decades 2\\" collection intended to cover a wider swath of his work.  This is however a nice representation of where Neil's work has gone (at least hits wise) over twenty some years. <br />
0790731002|5.0|This movie feautures a whole new look at the Batman saga,balancing Burton's vision with Schumacher's.From my opinion it's far better then BATMAN RETURNS,but better then BATMAN & ROBIN as well.The action is great too,at least for a mid 90's movie.I also think that the fans overeacted at the scene with Batman's butt-I don't believe that it was mean as a ''sexy scene'',but just a scene to show Batman's new suit.
B0000084J7|5.0|I got this CD from as a special gift from a friend 6 years ago. She thought I will love it since we both were a long time collector of music.  <br />After a long time listing to it and experiencing this sublime music over and over again, I can tell you that my experience with Mark Hollis solo album is incredible: never get tired of it, and always is about beauty and great music. <br /> <br />I understand that this CD is only found as an IMPORT. My is from Germany and the sound of the recording is gourgeus even when this includes dealing with silence. <br /> <br />If you are a serious collector or like good music over the usual shallow expectations of commercial music, don't doubt it and expect perfection! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm not really a big fan of heavy metal or rap, but this album is awesome!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I listened to it at my friend's place, and the next day I woke up early and got it as soon as I could. Best $20 (Australian) I have ever spent at Kmart. I listened to it for the rest of the day and I haven't stopped listening since (bought it around Christmas 2000 i think and it's now March 25 2005).  <br /> <br />My favourite songs are Points Of Authority and In The End, closely followed by Papercut. The lyrics in all of the songs are so well written and the music matches these lyrics perfectly. I haven't listened to a better album EVER!!!!! <br /> <br />Mike's raps are really well done and Chester's singing and screaming are absolutely awesome. Sends chills up my spine everytime I listen.  <br /> <br />Hope you find this review helpful, and trust me you won't regret it if you buy this CD.  <br /> <br />Peace Out, Caz
0441009425|3.0|This is a book that makes me pine for half stars, or a 1-10 system, because I would rate it 3.5 stars if allowed.  I liked it, but it was a little ho-hum.  The good parts were the capable writing - Reynolds can adeptly describe his world - and an excellent imagination.  My beef with the work is the flatness of the characters.  In some instances the motivation just wasn't convincing and their actions seemed to advance the plot and little else.   <br />Revelation Space does have some great action scenes and a sense of grandeur and scope befitting the \\"New Space Opera\\" genre.  But where authors like Peter Hamilton and Iain Banks seem to be making a statement about the human condition, Reynolds seems to run out of steam beyond the really cool ideas he has.  If the message was \\"hubris comes before the fall\\", ok, but I think we've all heard it before.   <br />Make no mistake, his imagination is great, and the technology and world building is top notch.  But in the end the individual players seemed to be just that - players.  Great SF gives you spectacular worlds and a compelling story with fascinating characters.  Revelation Space has a great premise, good pacing and a different take on our lack of alien contact.  In the end it`s a pretty good space opera, but with characters that are a little shallow and tough to sympathize or identify with.  It's good beach reading, but doesn't merit deeper attention.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|For more than ten years, screaming metal maniacs from around the world have been forced into starvation. Then came the \\"Angel of Retribution,\\" and the maniacs were then fed lavishly with the Prime Ribs au Jus!  <br />   As a loyal fan of the Priest machine, I have found the new album to be a well thought out combination of both the progressive and classic sounds that define Judas Priest. One listen to the songs such as \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Judas Rising\\" will send the message that the Priest is Back. Then relax and listen to \\"Worth Fighting For\\" and reminice of the classics such as those offered on \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\". Yes, \\"Angel\\" offers it all and is a fine addition to the Priest catalogue.  <br />
B00013RC66|4.0|A woman (Theresa Russell) marries rich guys and then poisons them; Debra Winger is sent to investigate. A real cat-and-mouse game develops between the two on Hawaii, and Winger sets up Russell perfectly--and surprisingly for the viewer. The characterization is a bit weak and fuzzy, but the story development and that terrific surprise ending (my lips are sealed) make for a neat little mystery/crime movie.
B000002U82|1.0|I truly couldn't find one song worth keeping on this album, and I love Pink Floyd. They have some really good songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"High Hopes\\", or \\"Hey You\\". I didn't like the \\"Echoes\\" Collection either because the songs were un-naturally spliced together where one song from an album ends and where one song from another album begins on the following track. They had to have altered at least 7 songs from their original endings and beginnings. It's like a complete album there.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the Phantom of the Opera film more than once and enjoyed it each time. It is exquisite, moving, and never ceases to give me the shivers.  <br />The music is of unparalled beauty and I think, wholeheartedly, that Miss Rossum, Mr. Butler, and the rest of the cast did a fabulous job. <br /> I have never seen the PTO play, but have heard so much about it from people that have, that I might as well have. I have heard the Sarah Brightman/Michael Crawford PTO music countless times and I simply love it.I own and have read the novel by Gaston Leroux several times. I favor the book over both the movie and the play and found the Phantom a tad bit...wimpy in the movie, but also see that he is portrayed more as a tragic lover than a more-than-slightly-insane genius with a taste for torture and a fettish for sleeping in coffins, but I love it nonetheless. <br />I believe that the new movie, the play, and the novel are the same in many ways, but in some respects completely different and can hardly be compared against one another. I am madly in love with all three stories and greatly encourage the enjoyment of each. Even if you have misgivings, I highly suggest that you at least view the new movie with an open mind.
B000002LRX|5.0|I remember this CD coming out at the same time Pearl Jam released their first CD and the Red Hot Chili Peppers released \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\". I picked it up and was blown away! Never had I heard anything like it. THis CD would remain in rotation in my CD player on and off for the next 10 years! Every song is a gem. Mike Patton and Faith No More went out on a limb and did their own thing without being concerned about their CD selling to the masses....while influencing a whole genra of music over the last 10 years! If you dont have this, pick it up. This is a classic. <br /> <br />It's great to see also that still to this day, even though FNM is no longer around, Mike Patton is pushing the bounds and still making great innovative music.  <br /> <br />PS: FNM reunion tour in 2006!
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Here is one band that you can expect amazing music from consistently. Queens of the Stone Age have one of the most unique styles in music today. This band doesn't follow your conventional Rock/Metal album, they just have that extra flavour of originality that far surpasses everything else. <br /> <br />I loved this cd. Front to back, sheer brillence; ballsy. Only QOTSA can write songs like Lullaby, Medication, Everybody Knows That You Are Insane, Tangled Up In Plaid, Burn the Witch, In My Head, Little Sister, I Never Came, and \\"You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\". Those are my favourite songs on the record. However, I love the whole cd and can listen to it over and over. <br /> <br />I went into this cd trying not to expect anything. I knew the songs would be catchy and original, but I didn't expect this. Especially after Songs for the Deaf. To this day, I cannot get enough of that record and I didn't want Lullabies to Paralyze to be pale in comparison to their previous work and it sure as hell didn't. <br /> <br />It's a masterpiece, but then again, would you expect anything less from these guys? This is one band I can rely on all the time for amazing music.
B000063UR2|3.0|A good fantasy movie. Dark and sinister. This DVD was obviously put out at this time because of the success of Lord of the Rings.  <br /> <br />The directors cut is better then the US version. The devil isnt shown till the end in the directors cut which makes for more suspense. Plus the US musical score was down right cheezy with 80s synth pop dubbed over. As for Tom Cruise, he's the worst part of the movie (as goes with any of his movies ). Tim Curry is whats makes this film shine. It would be interested to see what this movie would look like if Ridley Scott had done this in the 90s??
B00025ETIW|5.0|If you like punk/hardcore/emo bands you should really check out MCR. This is one of the most amazing bands I've heard.They are fronted by the handsome and dark Gerard way,who if full of energy.You can feel every word on this record and it stays with you.This is a cd to save your life,Buy it now or you will be missing out.Every single song is 10/10 stars!!
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|I can't believe Eastwood said this was his best film.  This flick is to be avoided entirely unless you are a glutton for misery.  The final revelation of the film -- in which Penn's character finds himself in a VERY bad, regretful, and awkward position -- redeams nothing, least of all the entertainment value of this dirge.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|Before I go any further, I must first say that this album may have the best QOTSA song ever! \\"Everybody Knows You're Insane\\" is one of the most haunting, pulsating songs I've ever heard. He's obviously singing about his former bandmate. The song alone captures frustration, doubt, and possible regret. This may be the ultimate break up song. When he's saying, \\"And I feel the same/am I better now,\\" you can tell his singing through clenched teeth. Too bad the rest of this cd isn't like this. \\"Little Sister\\" of course, is great. The first half is really good, but the rest is just kind of, well tame. I mean Songs For Death had a number of slow songs, but they were great. So I will say the inevitable. He needs Nick. Just like Nick needs him. It was a perfect balance. Nicks wildman to Josh's melody. They're supposebly cool again. I honestly feel that the next one could be great, but while this one is good, and definitely worth getting, it's lacking. Oh yeah, and the drummer is a little tame too. Couldn't he find someone with more thump? Well whatever teh case, you should still get it.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I was expecting the worst from this album after seeing so many bad reviews here.  How pleasantly surprised i was after listening through the whole album. I loved Homework so much, even more than Discovery.. and now ive got Human After All!! Yeh its repetitive, and some songs might give you a headache after a while (same deal with Homework) so what!? I'm sure i'll be listening to this for ages and im sure others will come to love it too!
B0007CNXUK|4.0|I did the unthinkable, and bought this movie without seeing it first.  I have made that \\"mistake\\" before, but thought my chances of disliking this movie were close to zero.  I am a big fan of Johnny Depp and love Kate Winslet, as well.  The story was also intriguing to me... so, although I have learned never to expect much of anything I get my hopes up about, I bought this feeling as if it had incredible potential.    I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie lived up to exactly what I hoped it to be... clever, well acted, inspirational, imaginative, visually stunning, and an overall treat with a powerful ending.  What a rare surprise, a movie lived up to my expectations and delivered!    I have heard several things about the innacurracies of historical events, but the spirit and the emotional impact were spot on and the historical \\"error\\" (although I believe it was deliberate), is completely irrelevant in my mind - in fact, it appears necessary in order to fully portray this story's significance in less than 2 hours.    Johnny Depp has proven himself, yet again.  In fact, with a list of great acting credits, this ranks up with one of his best, in my mind.  It is worth pointing out that the story is driven by dialogue and the character relationships, so - although there is nothing innappropriate for child minds, it may appear a bit slow and cause them to lose interest - although my three year old loved the ending!  This, I think, explains many of the poor ratings that this movie has received on Amazon - but dont let those \\"bored\\"  by this movie fool you!    This movie is inspiring and does what it intends to do - bring out the child in your heart; so long as you believe!  And I believe J M Barrie would be pleased by this movie.  When the movie ended, I pulled out my son's copy of Disney's version of Peter Pan and watched it, experiencing it and enjoying it all over again - and in a new light, thanks to this incredible movie.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|...mess that \\"High Fidelity\\" indeed is, but it turns out (despite the perhaps stupidest story ever as a consept of \\"turning boys into men\\") to mix the two most different kind of people -that makes this an outstanding nice cup of tea, to say it like an Englishman (I'm not by the way...)!    No seriously, this movie -\\"About a Boy\\"- is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and not to mention imagined to see Hugh Grant act in. This is my favorite Grant-movie, and it was after this I really began to respect the actor behind the famous icon -no one could have done this better than him in this movie -in fact; \\"About a Boy\\" IS Hugh Grant, in good company of young boy he acts against. Their chemistry, and their characters' contrasts are what makes this movie so interesting, and \\"realistic\\" actually. It's not a comedy, yet it's funny -it's not an ordinary drama, yet it's gripping!    You probably know what the movie is about after reading various reviews here, all I have to add is;    See this movie!
B0006SSOHC|2.0|Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot?  This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.  I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so.  I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br /><br />I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.

B00005JN2Z|4.0|To begin with, the movie had a pretty good story:  A Los Angeles, cab driver Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) picks up a gray-suited man named Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent offers Max a large sum of money to drive him to five locations around LA before the night is up. Max accepts, but realizes that Vincent is a hitman who has been hired to kill five people that night.<br /><br />'Collateral' features the career best performances of two seemingly different actors: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is a heavy-hitter; every one of his movies usually makes good dough, and a lot are good. Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies. When you hear their names mentioned for the same movie, you don't think it's stupid or impossible, just that the product movie will be some sort of run of the mill, action/comedy buddy picture.  The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night. Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />Another magnificent aspect is the ending. I wont spoil it, I'll just say that Vincent finds out the answer to the question, 'Who notices?'
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign in Blood is without a doubt Slayer's most famous album, and with good cause. Their muscianship is tight, the lyrics are less cheesy than previous albums and the songwriting is out of this world. I mean, let's face it. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are the John Lennon and Paul McCartney of extreme metal. They score direct hit with Angel of Death, Altar of Sacrifice, Jesus Saves, Postmortem, and of course Raining Blood. I've seen other reviewers complain about the monotony of this album, but I disagree. The songs are all of the same style and mood (extreme), but that is the point. The album is under a half hour in length, the perfect balance between being too short and dragging on. If it was longer, this disc would indeed get to be more of the same, but the Rick Rubin and Slayer wisely keep it quick and devastating. The guys set out to make the best album to bang your head to that they possibly could and they succeeded 100%. I might not reccomend this as a first album if you are new to Slayer (Seasons in the Abyss is more represenative of all the different styles that they play) but if you are an experienced metalhead, this is an essential part of any evil record collection. <br /> <br />Solid start to finish; highly recommended.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I first heard \\"here with me\\" when I was watching videos late one night and I completely fell in love with her soothing voice. Every song on this album is incredible, from the catchy and most famous \\"Thank You\\" to the soul shattering \\"My Lovers Gone\\" to the incredible lyrics of \\"Hunter\\". They are all amazingly played out. If you don't like songs that are a bit slower this may not be the CD for you. Dido is completely gifted and doesn't seem to be trying to impress anyone when she is! I am in love with this CD. Buy it!
B00009Y3L4|3.0|I have mixed emotions about \\"Cabaret\\".  The songs by Kander and Ebb are great.  The routines choreographed by Bob Fosse are mesmerizing.  Joel Grey is wonderfully energetic as the Emcee.  As great as he is, though, I don't know how he received the Oscar over Al Pacino for \\"The Godfather\\".  Unfortunately, once the film leaves the Kit Kat Club it's a whole other story.  The story is pure mawkish soap opera.  I feel bad for an actor of Michael York's calibre having to slog through this drivel.  Liza Minelli is a different story altogether.  Sally Bowles is not a particularly compelling character and Minelli lacks the skills to make this character compelling.  Should I also state that she isn't even that great a singer?  How did she ever win the Oscar?  While we're at it how did Fosse ever beat Francis Ford Coppola for the Oscar in direction?  Fosse was a good director(see \\"Lenny\\"), but come on.
0440418569|3.0|The Amber Spyglass is the long-awaited conclusion to Philip Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials. The Story continues with Lyra Belaqua who is on a quest to find forgiveness for the death of her friend Roger. Lyra gets assistance of Will Parry, keeper of the Subtle Knife, who can cut doors to other worlds. But before they can start their quest, Lyra has to get released from the grasp of her mother, Mrs. Coulter, who keeps her daughter in a drug-induced sleep. Maybe the armored bear Iorek Byrnison will arrive on time to help her? In the meantime Dr. Mary Malone, the scientist that helped Lyra in search of the Dust, has found one of Will's windows to a land where small-horned, elephant-like creatures called Mulefa ride on wheels made of seed pods. Unbeknownst to her, she on track of something that might save the children... and maybe the Universe.<br /><br />Where the previous two episodes of His Dark Materials, were excelling in creating a magnificent Universe with strong storylines, this final book had the task of concluding the trilogy. A tremendous task, because the story so far had quite a few loose ends that needed weaving together. Maybe this assignment was underestimated by the author, because the story gets very confusion from the point where Lyra and Will find each other again. New worlds are introduced and theories on what Dust is all about are explained, but the main drive of the story seems to get to the background. It is as if the trilogy suddenly becomes more of an epic tale, than a fantastic adventure. More than once I was completely lost and had to browse back a few pages to get back into the story.<br /><br />The story so far had quite some potential, but the author did not really succeed in bringing it all on paper. Maybe four books instead of three would have given the story more room to breath.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|When they were handicapping the Oscars this year \\"Finding Neverland\\" took up the rear.  In my book I ranked Marc Forster's film a shade behind \\"The Aviator\\" as the best film of the year.  This is an amazing film that demands our emotional involvement and earns it.  Johnny Depp is terrific as J.M. Barrie, a blocked playwright who finds inspiration through his relationship with a widow and her four boys.  In an understated way Depp manages to convey the inner workings of a man who learns to unloose his imagination and in the process create a work of lasting impact.  Kate Winslet is effervescent as Sylvia, a woman who is learning to enjoy life after great tragedy.  Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife, Mary, gives dimension and empathy to a character that in lesser hands would have been villified.  The impression you are left with is that it is just as much the fault of James than Mary for the dissolution of their marriage.  Julie Christie also creates a full bodied character in the role of Sylvia's mother.  In lesser hands she could appear shrewish but Christie manages to convey that her character's stern demeanor is born from concern for her daughter and grandchildren's well-being and not some unbased malevolence.  The actors playing Sylvia's children are all excellent but special mention should go to Freddie Highsmore as Peter.  Of all the children in the film his character evolves the most psychologically and Highsmore gives a performance of great depth.  Ironically, you almost forget the prescence here of Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's producer.  Hoffman is good but this is not a particularly demanding part for him.
0679746048|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie and while they are similar on the surface they are quite different.  My reaction on seeing the movie was that the main characters did not seem to exhibit the charactaristics of their supposed diagnoses....after reading the book it is clear that some liberties were taken.<br /><br />The book is an honest and compelling read, albeit a short one.  I do with it were longer to be honest.  The people in the book do seem real.  Much more real and true than they did in the movie.  I am not saying that I didnt like the movie, in fact I did.  Perhaps it is just that the characters in the movie are just that, characters and representations of those in the book.<br /><br />I found the girls in the movie much more likable (therefore unbelievable) and not what I would have expected from persons diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or a sociopath, for example.<br /><br />I found the book to be a more realistic version of Ms Kaysen's story.  It doesn't make the hospital look like a fun girls sorority, it is clearly a hospital.  It is not a good place to be and it is clearly a place attempting to heal broken people and not a place where the patients are in charge.<br /><br />Despite portraying how difficult the people really were, how unlikable or sick, it is not hard to care about them, wonder what happened to them and feel for them.  I believe that Ms Kaysen did an excellent job telling the story of that part of her life.
B0006399FS|1.0|the only people who still listen to this band do so because they have never heard GOOD music.  Please do not waste your money on this dreck.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! With all the  awards it received, and all the money it made,  I can't believe Paramount, put out a dvd that's  not enhanced for widescreen T.V.s! How could they  be so f#*n cheap! I hear there's a better dvd coming  out soon, if there is, I'll have to change my review  about the quality of the dvd. It's about time!!!!
B000025802|3.0|One of the problems in recording all of the symphonies of any composer is that some of the performances will fail.  Just like very few sporting teams can win 9 games in a row, very few conductor/orchestra combinations can pull off 9 excellent performances.  In this set there are only 2 excellent ones, 7 and 8. The New World (9) is cold and passionless, his Chicago recording was absolutely magnificent.  The rest are ponderous and lacking in charm.  It seems like the Berlin Philharmonic was simply not interested in the early symphonies of Dvorak.  I wonder if they ever played them in concert or did they simply record them.  Whatever, this set is not a bargain.  One more thought: 2 of the symphonies are spread over two CDs.  There is no excuse for doing something that outrageous.  I checked the timings and the symphonies could have been placed on the 6 cds without spreading any of them on 2 discs.  Or they could have simply put the set on 7 cds.  Blank CDs don't cost much.
B00004XONN|5.0|Ok, to Pablo Honey/Bends fans I plead with you for your sake not to write this off as weird electronica experimental crap.  Yes it is weird and electronica and experimental and it is perfection.  I own everything from Pablo Honey to Hail to the Theif and this and Amnesiac are my co-favourites.  Radiohead layers tracks in a manner to create unbelievable depth of music that is beautiful in every sense of the word.  It is a trip through a soundscape of enormous complexity that can be overwhelming at first (I know I was).  With subsequent listens I started to pick up on the things they were doing and started hear more of the subtleties.  The talent and vision are stunning.  For those looking for another Bends/Pablo or even OK Computer, please hold your breath until they release another album and see if they give you that.  When they don't maybe you should try taking a lesson from Radiohead instead of dictating what you want them to play you, and grow a little in your music appreciation.  If you don't like this album, have you considered that it might be you, not them that's the problem?  Beatles, Dylan, Velvet Underground, Zepplin, Radiohead... no, I have no problem including them in this list at all.  Favourite tracks:  all of them, especially Kid A, National Anthemn, Everything in its right place, How to Disappear completely, Treefingers, Optimistic, In Limbo, Idioteque, Motion Picture Soundtrack and Morning Bell (my personal favourite).... I guess that's every song.  Buy it's srange brother Amnesiac once you adore this one... I love it just as much for very different reasons.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never really got into Joss Whedon's other projects (though my sister is a huge Buffy fan).  When I saw the previews for Firefly on TV years ago I didn't get it.  It didn't look interesting.  Two years after the show was cancelled my room mate brought the DVDs home and insisted I give the series a chance.  I eventually gave in and I'm glad I did.  It was so good I bought my own copy of the series.  If you buy only one TV series on DVD make it Firefly! <br /> <br />~James <br />
B000063COX|5.0|The time of this writing is March 25, 2005. I updated this review on June 6, 2007. Looking back on it all now, I have to say that Iron Maiden's Iron Maiden, is their first and best album.    It is mind boggling to consider the quality of the recording considering it was done in 1979, a time when many hard rock/heavy metal bands were unable to capture such high fidelity sound and/or energy or aggressiveness on their releases. In other words, the production quality is excellent.    Every track on the album is a compliment to the one that follows it, and as far as the lineup, in my opinion this was their best. Those who do not know early Maiden and are fans of Bruce Dickerson will most likely disagree. But I actually prefer Paul Di'Anno to him. Di'Anno's vocal style added a totally different dimension to the band. It would have been interesting to hear what their third release would have sounded like (Di'Anno only recorded two albums with the band) had he remained on board.    What is especially attractive about Maiden as exemplified by this debut, is their compostions are done in such a way that the bass lines stand out, as opposed to being under a mix of riffs in a two guitarist line up. Credit their phenomenal bass player, composer and founding member Steve Harris for this.    That said, all of the technological foot pedal gadgetry was put to its best use is on this album, the wah wah pedal, overdrive, screaming and or very melodic solos and harmonies. Check out the opening track, Prowler, and the dreamy and melodic Strange World, track no. 7. to see what I mean. Again, It's all here on this album, from hard driving thumping bass to delicate harmonics and the use of overtones, wailing guitar and blistering solos, and great chord progressions.    Phantom of the Opera, track no. 5, my favorite Maiden song off all time, is testimony to that. For true metal fans espeically Maiden fans, this album should be a collectors item. At the very least you owe it to yourself to give it a listen.
0375703861|2.0|White Teeth is of a style I like to think of as the Anglo response to Magical Realism in Spanish lit, popularized by Marquez and Allende (arguably originated by Rulfo). The anglo version adds a bit more concrete, more familiar vernacular, a little less fairytale, a little more sass. <br /> <br />Most Smith fans will also enjoy Salman Rushdie. Tom Robbins people might find trying this out worthwhile. There is also a pacing, and a drawing together of plot-lines that should give lovers of ironic mysteries smoother entree into this, more emotive, more pensive style. <br /> <br />Why 2 stars? It ain't my thing. The characters eventually felt like tools she was moving around to generate whatever weirdly cool dramatic moments she could imagine. The power of those moments was lost because the personality of the characters became so transparent. You might say, \\"of course she has to react that way to him so she can end up with the other guy and the first guy can be with the new girl who is the other guy's cousin...Boom! Irony.\\"  <br /> <br />Create a chart of each character's movements around one another in the course of the book and you'll have a very pretty, and self contained design. One that in book form reads like a long pun. <br /> <br />Why not one star? Because she was able, while a little aggressive on the this-is-a-book-about-mixing-cultures tip, she was able to nail some very specific and genuine cultural perspectives and artifacts that kept the book in my hand all the way to its deflating last chapter, which I just finished, and am still perplexed by the choices.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Ok before I begin I wanted to state one thing , this cd's track listing had me going insane for a few days till I found on a website what the correct track listing is. Even the bands website has things a little messed up. Often listed as having 15 songs when in fact the cd only has 12 tracks on it clocking in at over 75 minutes long. The title track Frances the mute was cut from the cd as well due to time restraints. Ignore the listing amazon.com has as well , if you follow the lyric sheet inside the booklet from the cd,here is how the songs actually will break down. 1.Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus <br />2.The Widow <br />3.L'Via L'Viaquez <br />4.Miranda, that ghost just isn't holy Anymore <br />5.Cassandra Geminni I <br />6.Cassandra Geminni II <br />7.Cassandra Geminni III <br />8.Cassandra Geminni IV <br />9.Cassandra Geminni V <br />10.Cassandra Geminni VI <br />11.Cassandra Geminni VII <br />12.Cassandra Geminni VIII <br />The lyrics follow this pattern exactly,even though they only list 5 parts to Cassandra Geminni , the lyrics and track settings tell a differant story. Figuring this out was also alot harder then it should have been. NOW... Onto the music on the actual cd.  <br />This has been one of those discs that you hear and are turned off by it at first then the musicianship really kicks in. By the end of the cd I was hooked. Everyone that had told me to check them out was not kidding but the music is really out there. I have seen ALOT of negative reviews here on this cd and many people did not understand the ambient segments and slow down parts. Quite honestly many people who have not heard bands do this before needs to investigate older Pink Floyd - specificaly the Meddle release with Echoes on it as well as the entire Atom Heart Mother release also the Animals release has some moments like this but no where near the psychadelia of the earlier releases and that is where Frances The Mute borrows heaviest from. The vocals are often like Robert Plant/Led Zepplin style with the music often reminding me of the technical aspects of Tool. As far as the over all cd goes , it must be heard in all the way through to be fully appreciated on a higher level.  <br />Here is my opinions of each song :  <br />1/Cygnus - This is the reason I honestly gave the cd 4 instead of 5 stars , this song seems to drag on and on and on without end and it is such an erratic song it makes listening to it very hard to get through. I feel it is the weakest spot on the cd and it is the opener.  <br />2/The Widow - the slowest point on the cd , I cant help but wonder if they might try and do this as a single. Though it sounds as far away from radio play as possible,it is still very short and a great song. Very melodic and haunting though the extended ending/opening for following track gets a bit tedious.  <br />3/L'Via L'Viaquez - mostly in spanish but by far the most melodic track on the disc , they dont stray too far here while keeping the music and beats simple and it works wonders! <br />4/Miranda, that ghost just isn't holy Anymore - Ok this is what got my wife to think they didnt completly suck. She hated a few songs on the cd.  It often breaks into long drawn out moments like in Pink Floyd's Echoes and doesnt let up - these are some of the longest tracks on the cd until.... <br />5-12 Cassandra Gemeni - The reason I purchased this cd! It is one some amazing lyrical content and the music is just mind blowing. These tracks are what really made me like the cd. The music is all over the place and the intense drumming made my jaw drop. The 35 minute opus can really take a bit to get through but anyone who appreciated amazing musicians really needs to hear this to be believed.  <br />Inside the cd case (under where the cd goes) there are lyrics to Frances the mute but as I stated earlier that there was not eneough room to fit it onto the cd , so we may see it on a future release.  Over all I think its a solid cd but starting it off with a 13minute song that honestly is not very good can possibly kill a disc but luckily it doesnt here. The rest is amazing eneough to be completly forgiven. Quite honestly I would rate the cd 4 1/2 stars out of 5 because the one track does not kill the cd in its entirety. So go and see for yourself and see what you think. The low pricetag also is a huge welcome for a cd that is this good! Give it a chance , worse thing that can happen is screaming I want my money back as some reviewers already have.
1400034779|4.0|This is one of the most original novels I've read in a long time.  Prepare to settle in for more than your share of \\"bush tea\\" and follow the rambling narrative to its satisfying end.  All of the details in this novel are delightful, and no detail is over-described.  There is a lot of room for your own imagination in this book!
B00005JN4H|4.0|I was reluctant to see Taxi because of all the bad reviews I had heard.  But, just like Jersey Girl, I actually liked this movie.  It was cute and Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon  are great in it.  My dad and I smiled, or laughed, through the whole movie.  It is not a serious movie, but it does have a theme that persistence will get you to your goals.  It had action, romance, and comedy.   I would recommend this for any comedy fan it is a cute movie.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|That's all I can say, WOW. For years I have been wanting to see this on stage. I know all of the music but I have never seen a live performance until now. Granted this is a movie and not the stage but I was blown away by everything in it. I've been a Les Miserables fan for years and have been wanting to compare the two. Well I can't. I love this as much as Les Miserables but in different way. I SERIOUSLY can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can see it once again. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film. I really hope that they make a musical movie version of Les Miserables as they did with Evita and Phantom.  <br /> <br />I'll be waiting.

B0002234LS|4.0|I was riveted...I was staring at the screen with my mouth wide open during this film.....BUT...then I got to the end.  I won't spoil the movie for you by telling you what happens, but I will say that if you want to love this movie, shut it off about 15 minutes before it ends.  When you watch the ending, you will be as surprised as you were with The Sixth Sense...but not NOT in a good way.
B000002I2M|5.0|There are few albums that stand up to the true display of stature and talent that a band like The Doors are as on this album. This is truly The Doors at their finest. It may not be the \\"Break\\"ing collection that \\"Fire\\"d their self-titled debut, it may not be \\"Drive\\"ing the \\"Latitudes\\" of Strange Days, have the \\"Unknown\\" \\"Caravan\\" of sound from Waiting For The Sun, the \\"Wishful\\" \\"Touch\\" of The Soft Parade, or even the great dreamlike \\"Peace\\"ful \\"Blues\\" of Americana that is shown on Morrison Hotel.  But it does have the true charismatic attitude that The Doors always wanted to bring to the studio. I feel that this is their best work. Every song from \\"The Changeling\\" to \\"Riders On The Storm\\" has a true feel of blues that was always attempted on their earlier works, yet not perfected until Jim, Robby, Ray, and John introduced us to Mr. Mojo Risin. I've been an enormously huge Doors fan since the age of about 12. My hippie dad used to play them to put me to sleep while I was in the crib. So, I was a Doors conaseur since I was young. I own all their albums, their box sets, their rarities, their books, etc. The Doors are one of the greatest gifts that rock has to offer. They were one of the many bands that carried with them the burdens of change, war, peace, love, and rebirth that stood out in an era divided and going in several directions. Few bands have made and ever will leave a lasting impression on music as The Doors have. And they make their final bow with Jim on LA Woman. So turn up the \\"Texas Radio\\" and \\"Love\\" It \\"Madly\\"!
B000024A70|5.0|Darn when cd's first came out what you where looking for was hard to find. And Queen was at the top of my list to get something into my budding cd collection. I finally found this at our local record store as the vinyl was slowly circling its drain due to cd's. And yes the first Queen I saw on the shevles was this import. Darn glad I got it that day even though I considered the price steep due to it being an import it still took the cd industry some years to get all of the choices you have now days I do not need another queen this on did me fine though its play list is different from what they have here tracks 1 - 6 are the same the rest go like this  <br />7.Don't Stop Me Now  <br />8.Save Me  <br />9.Crazy Little Thing Called Love <br />10.Somebody To Love  <br />11.Now I'm Here  <br />12.Good Old-Fashoned Lover Boy  <br />13.Play The Game  <br />14.Flash <br />15.Seven Seas Of Rhye  <br />16.We Will Rock You  <br />17.We Are The Champions  <br />What can I say this order works for me. And if you want more Queen than this hey go for it I do not blame you good stuff from a great band that started in the 70's. No one else like them. I still remeber driving down the road to tapes I made from the vinyl I had of them.

B0006ZE7G2|3.0|I just picked up this DVD this past week, and lemme just say this: if you loved the movie (which I did and still do), then it's definitely worth owning (the Waters/Scarfe commentary I thought was really cool) - however - I DO believe that the DVD is overpriced (spending some-odd $20, I expected 2 discs, not one - and not enough \\"stuffing\\" to justify the price).  <br /> <br />I also read some the other posted reviews (the 1-star ones in particular), and I reluctantly agree. It's even safe to say that I should've known Roger was really going to play up the \\"pat himself on the back\\" game, but sorry, Rog, being subjected to that on The Making of The Dark Side Of The Moon wasn't exactly a real bleepin' treat, either. Long story short: buy it for owning the movie in DVD format with the extras, but the price of the disc is PRECISELY the reason why file-sharing is so immensely popular...
B00062IDCO|4.0|This is a good season to end voyager but it ends with to much on the time travel/time alteration theme in endgame. The last two epiosdes are good but there is just like an abrupt end to the struggle to get home. Janeway travels back in time to try to change things that caused the journey to take 23 years to complete..we have been through seven and then the show ends. It would have made more sense to re-install the tran warp drive thing and encounter the borg along the way and somehow destroy their trans warp network somehow in another fashion or if species 8472 would have come back wanting to destroy the Borg completely it would have made more sense. Otherwise, the season is better than season six was in my opinion.
B0006399FS|3.0|First off I must say I've been a U2 fan for many years though more for the \\"mainstream\\" hits than for entire albums. I was very hesitant about this one for the simple fact that the samples of the tracks, other than \\"Vertigo\\", were not very exciting. <br />I thought they sounded very slow and melancholy and frankly, boring. \\"Vertigo\\" was catchy from the first listen and to my ears very typically U2. <br />The rest of the album doesn't reach that height but after a few spins, it's not nearly as uninteresting as I initially thought.  <br />The slower songs have a beauty all their own, they pull you in. <br />There are some faster tempo numbers with hooks that I didn't expect.  <br />I've come to like this album and perhaps to some it's far from the best U2 has ever recorded, but it's still infinitely better than many albums I've heard.  <br />Give it a chance and perhaps a second or third and see if you don't find something you like. <br />I'll bet you will. I did.
B00005JLF5|4.0|I have never seen deep space nine before watching this whole dvd although I have seen most of the next generation and voyager. I decided to get it after going through the whole seven seasons of voyager. It is different because it is set on a space station although there are episodes where action take place outside the station...like a trip thrpough the wormhole to the Gamma quadrant. I think the first two episode of this first season are the best. They are really excellent episodes. They say this series gets better as you go along but the first was pretty good but not quite great.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|By now it's no secret that you can always rely on Queens of the Stone Age to deliver your fix if you're jonesing for some intelligent, interesting hard rock, and their latest album shouldn't do anything to tarnish their already lofty reputation in the rock world.  That said, there are some pretty big changes to be absorbed here, starting with the personnel: after the commercial breakthrough of Songs for the Deaf, bassist and co-founder Nick Oliveri left and took the band's punkish edge with him, while Dave Grohl departed with his legendary drumming skills and his star power in tow.  However, Josh Homme apparently wasn't going down that easy, as he quickly regrouped, took the helm himself, and churned out Lullabies to Paralyze with a reconstituted lineup.  There are some other changes to absorb, as well, as the band's recent tumult is reflected in a rather modified sound.  For those accustomed to the catchy, at times even radio-friendly stylings of Songs for the Deaf or its predecessor Rated R, this album will surely come as something of a surprise.  And even those who are familiar with Josh's larger body of work going back to his days with stoner rock pioneers Kyuss are likely be taken somewhat aback by what's on display here.<br /><br />Whatever you may think of him, you've got to give Josh Homme credit for at least one thing: for a guy who just experienced an unlikely commercial breakthrough less than three years ago, he's not playing it safe and cranking out singles for the local corp-rock station on this album.  Lullabies to Paralyze is notably less accessible and immediately gratifying than the album that came before it (and the album that came before that, for that matter), as it's marked throughout by a twisted guitar sound and an overall disaffected mood that only intensifies as it goes on.  This reviewer can't help but think the strains of the rock and roll lifestyle are starting to wear on Josh after a decade and a half, as Lullabies is easily the darkest and hardest-edged thing he's put out, at least under the Queens of the Stone Age moniker.  Nick's departure has regrettably reduced the band's fun quotient a bit, but no matter:  the band is obviously in more than capable hands with Josh as its principal mastermind, as this album manages to convey a suitably raw and grungy feel without masking the razor-sharp songwriting to be found within.<br /><br />In his illustrious career Josh has proven himself adept at finding an endless series of variations on both the basic rock riff and the time-honored rock song form, and this album is no exception.  Here the result is a collection of songs that show a consistent knack for starting you off in one direction and then pulling you without warning in another.  Lullabies to Paralyze revels in off-kilter time signatures, jarring song structures, and heavy layers of guitar distortion, and while that made the album more of a challenge that I had anticipated, it was all the more rewarding for it.<br /><br />Lullabies to Paralyze mines more sonic territory on its first three songs than most entire albums: Mark Lanegan's husky baritone crooning sets the tone nicely on This Lullaby; Medication is a short, sharp burst of chugging rock fury; and Everybody Knows That You are Insane starts as a mournful quasi-ballad before careening suddenly into a more chaotic sound propelled by a momentous groove.  From there the Queens explore a different corner of the rock world at almost every turn, ranging from warped pop-rock to warped alt-rock to warped noise rock (you should be noticing a pattern by now).  Lullabies to Paralyze is predictably unpredictable, flying out in all sorts of directions (and with all sorts of instrumentation), but the top-notch musicianship of Josh & Co. is always there to hold things together.  At the end of the day Lullabies to Paralyze is almost as trippy, as groove-laden, and as utterly enjoyable as anything the Queens have ever put out.

1400032717|5.0|I find it difficult to come up with a more original word than \\"Amazing\\" for this book, but it truly is an exceptional tale. There is no need to describe the plot in this review because it is handled well enough by others, but I do want to say that this is a very unique reading experience--an unforgetable look into the mind and perspective of someone whose brain processes day-to-day information in a way that is very different from the majority of people in the world. The character's approach to problem solving was absolutely fascinating!! This book is definitely in my top-ten alltime favorite category; if I could give it SIX STARS I would!! Don't miss this experience!! <br />
0780631684|2.0|\\"Final Destination\\" contains some of the silliest death scenes I have ever seen. I actually held out a little hope that it would be at least a little bit above average given its premise. But, no it is a typical, by-the-numbers game of \\"who's next?\\" If that's what you're looking for then have at it. I guess I just shouldn't have bothered. The movie I really wanted has already been made. Rent \\"Fearless\\" instead. Its a serious explorarion of how it might feel to cheat death.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is one of Dire Straits' best CDs behind OES, OTN, SOS, & <br />BIA. All these songs are great! The weakest song is Les Boys. <br />If you buy this album, get Sultans of Swing - The Very Best of <br />Dire Straits and you own the essential Dire Straits. I can play <br />this album on 4 or 5 different CD players and it works great. <br /> <br />1. Tunnel of Love-One of their best songs ever! I like this song <br />as a closing track. <br /> <br />2. Romeo and Juliet-I like the piano in this song. The piano is <br />has a great rythum. Vocals are great! <br /> <br />3. Skateaway-One of my favorites! This song did some of the best <br />work on it. I like the vocals in this song. <br /> <br />4. Expresso Love-What a coffee song! Listen to this if you ever <br />visit an expresso like Starbuck's Coffee! One of the good ones. <br /> <br />5. Hand in Hand-Slow start, has some good stuff to the song. <br /> <br />6. Solid Rock-I like this song! This song has a great rythm to <br />it. <br /> <br />7. Les Boys-Like I said, this is the weakest song on the entire <br />CD!  <br /> <br />If you are a fan to Dire Straits, then you will most likely will <br />love this CD because this CD rocks! Don't get me wrong, way better than Brothers in Arms. If you want a perfect buy, buy this <br />CD and get Sultans of Swing, On The Night, and On Every Street. <br />That will match your perfect order! <br /> <br />Overall Great CD!
B000001FSU|3.0|\\"State of Euphoria\\", Anthrax's follow up to their classic and influential \\"Among the Living\\", is sadly one of the band's most lacking albums.  Even though it features two of the band's most well known and beloved songs, \\"Be All End All\\" and \\"Antisocial\\", \\"State of Euphoria\\" still manages to come off as pretty average thanks to some just plain lame songs like \\"Make Me Laugh\\", \\"Schism\\", \\"13\\", and the closing \\"Finale\\"; all of which are possibly the worst songs Anthrax ever recorded with Joey Belladonna on vocal duty.  That aside, the rest of the songs featured here are solid thrashers, but as a whole \\"State of Euphoria\\" can't hold a candle to \\"Spreading the Disease\\" or \\"Among the Living\\".  All in all, if your a new fan to Anthrax, start with any of the previously mentioned albums or even some of the later John Bush era albums (\\"Volume 8\\" through \\"Greater of Two Evils\\") before picking \\"State of Euphoria\\" up.
B000654YRY|5.0|This DVD rocks! Mark Knopfler does very heavy metal on \\"Heavy Fuel\\". Even \\"The Bug\\" is on this live DVD! \\"Walk Of Life\\" he does <br />perfect on this version and \\"Money for Nothing\\" is a pure hard <br />rock classic that you will need to listen to on the CD! But I rather get the CD in addition to the DVD! But where the heck is <br />Sting singing 'I WANT MY MTV'? \\"Calling Elvis\\" is a bit to long <br />and the other version is slight ly better! <br /> <br />Oveall great DVD!
B000006TRV|5.0|This was my first Pink Floyd album and I still think it is the best one. Although Dark Side, Meddle and Atom Heart Mother are probably as good as The Wall, just a little bit different. I did not like The Final Cut because you can notice that it is filled with The Wall's discarded songs. <br /> <br />I've read many opinions about The Wall. Some people say that it just tells a sad whiny story. Well it is far more than that, it is pure art. If you want some cheer up go an buy some self-help book. This is art, and artists like shakespeare or Benigni (or any good writer) sometimes write about tragedy.  <br /> <br />This story tells the deepest feelings of a person going through life, in fact a different life from the one most of us live, however it is a very interesting drama. Is he guilty for the things that happen to him?? Probably, but this is not for you to judge. Just sit down and enjoy this masterpiece. If you feel depresed (as someone mentioned in his review) when you finish listening, it is because you have some kind of psychological problem (you might be depressive). This is just music, art. <br /> <br />One tip. Listen to this album from the beginning to the end, don't skip any song. ENJOY IT!!
B000654YS8|5.0|This DVD is awesome! All the tracks are rad! You get to see how <br />they did their songs! In order, I'll review all the songs, it <br />even has my favorite \\"Heavy Fuel\\" which is their best song ever! <br /> <br />SULTANS OF SWING-Great open up to the DVD! Mark plays this song <br />really well! This was their earliest song. <br /> <br />LADY WRITER-Mark does a pretty good job on the guitar on this song. <br /> <br />ROMEO AND JULIET-I don't see no instruments! Where the heck are <br />the instruments?  <br /> <br />TUNNEL OF LOVE-One of the best songs ever! Nasty looking woman! <br /> <br />PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS-Okay too slow and boring for me! Thank god <br /> <br />TWISTING BY THE POOL-Not a total classic but is a song you can <br />listen to over N' over again! <br /> <br />LOVE OVER GOLD-I can't remember this video, and I can't remember <br />when the drums started. <br /> <br />SO FAR AWAY-One great video. Classic rock fans need to see this <br />video. <br /> <br />MONEY FOR NOTHING-You see those refrigerators and those coulor <br />tvs and microwave ovens! The Straits can't do all of that! <br /> <br />BROTHERS IN ARMS-Good peaceful video where you can't go to war! <br />A true classic rock song. <br /> <br />WALK OF LIFE-See how they do the electric organ? You see some <br />sports in this video. <br /> <br />CALLING ELVIS-Nothing to say, but you can call Elvis! <br /> <br />HEAVY FUEL-My personal favorite video! Everything rocks in this <br />video. You need to see this video. <br /> <br />ON EVERY STREET-Play the other version insted of the On The Night <br />Live version. <br /> <br />Alright I'm getting bored. <br />
6304712936|4.0|Amadeus is one hell of a movie. With its phenomenal acting, realistic locations and dramatic storytelling Director Milos Forman depicts the power, truth and wisdom in Salieri story. I enjoyed this film from a viewers perspective and a film makers perspective.  <br /> \\"Watching Amadeus is like listening to Mozart: it is a horrible beauty beyond words.\\" Says James Brundage from filmcritic.com. Which I agree with entirely. Amadeus leaves you speechless and left in deep thought. <br />The first thing I instantly liked about the film was the narrative from the older Salieri. I really like how he was sitting there playing the piano and then in walks the priest. How Salieri introduces Mozart was clever too, that's probably one of my favorite parts of the movie.  <br />Some of the filming techniques were also very intriguing. For example, when they showed Mozart as a child performing blindfolded. That was a very well planned ingenious shot. Now even though this isn't my kind of movie, these filming techniques kept me watching. Another favorite part of mine was when Mozart walked into the room hearing a piece being played and was able to play it back without looking at a music sheet. That was a very well thought out sequence.  <br /> I think the actor who played Mozart was well chosen, he really captured the obnoxiousness of Amadeus. He really lit up the screen with those outrageous wigs and that absurd laugh. It almost broke my ear drums. But his performance at the end towards his death was outstanding. <br /> The number one thing I could not stand was those wigs. I just wanted to jump into movie and beat the living crap out of those entire wig wearing pansies. I think the costume crew could've done better with the wigs. Maybe they were the way they had them back then, they still aggravated me. <br /> This movie was a big step in cinematic history. Although I'm not into these kind of films I hold it highly recommend it to anyone that is able to watch it. The climatic last ten minutes are worth it, Salieri and Mozart side by side writing... <br />
B000001EG6|4.0|As I began the task of reviewing the Elton albums that matter most to me, I had to ask myself, \\"What is it you want most from an Elton album?\\"  The answer will likely be different for everyone, but my list reveals why I like this album so much, and consider it the second-best Elton album, behind Tumbelweed Connection.    #1.  Piano--lots and lots o' piano.  #2.  The serious, romantic, vulnerable Elton; leave the goofy side for someone else.  #3.  A real band sound, or arrangements that sound like real instruments are being played (more acoustic ones than electronic).  Sgt. Pepper doesn't have a mellotron, afterall!  #4.  An album that features ballads, Elton's supreme contribution to music.    O.K..  If you agree with most of this list, my reviews of Elton are for you.  This is Elton's second-best album because it satifies most of the above points on my list.  The standouts (ballads, of course) are the great quartet of songs, \\"The Greatest Discovery\\", \\"Your Song\\", \\"First Episode at Hienton\\" and \\"I Need You To Turn To\\" in that order.  I wonder if Paul McCartney has ever commented on \\"Greatest Discovery\\", as it evokes his song, \\"She's Leaving Home\\", and, I humbly submit, is just as lovely and masterful a song.  I can only imagine that Paul wished he had written this song.  Stylistically, Elton is not his own person yet, this being only his second album.  It's a hodgepodge, but, interestingly, his ballads here will never sound the same on later albums, because he wrote them in an English folk manner, not in the later, Gospel-inflected tone of nearly all his future ballads.  Likewise, his singing is also borrowed, if you will, from English folk--I hear the sound of Sandy Denny's voice being imitated here.  Nevertheless,  \\"Discovery\\" and \\"Hienton\\" are uncommonly beautiful fruits of innocence, uncommon even for Elton, the greatest balladeer after (or since) Sir Paul.      But, make no mistake, there's plenty of the gospel-tinged Elton here.  \\"Border Song\\" is better than nearly any gospel-tinged song he wrote. Taupin pulled off a simple yet direct message this time.  Musically, the detail of the piano part is astonishing, not a note was left to chance--this is the musicians' musician; all over this album fine touches abound.    The \\"band\\", such as it is for a pick-up group, is mostly good, just below that of Tumbelweed, which had Elton's best band.  The arrangement/orchestration is mostly very tasteful--except that ridiculous intro to \\"Sixty Years On\\".  Bernie Taupin's lyrics, which I've covered ad nauseum in other reviews, are, like Tumbleweed, mostly inoffensive here; he captures a mood of innocence that is almost beyond criticism. Yes, he overreaches  with highfalutin poetry, but I think it's out of a real fervor for the subject matter.  He would never again write so unself-consciously (rare for a green lyricist).    Footnote: Everyone knows Elton can rock; it's just that I don't see those songs as the supreme gifts Elton leaves to pop music.  But Elton makes one of his best country-rock songs here with \\"No Shoe Strings On Louise\\", not just a dead-on Stones tribute, but one of his loosest, least self-conscious rockers ever!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|First of all I would like to point out something that one of the previous reviewers was complaining about, regarding the use of \\"In My Head\\" from Desert Sessions 9&10 on Lullabies to Paralyze. I would just like make it clear that this would not be the first time they've used a DS song on their new CD. \\"Avon\\" from DS 3&4 appeared on the first self-titled QOTSA album. \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire\\" from DS 5&6 and \\"Hanging Tree\\" from DS 7&8 were both present on Songs for the Deaf. I really don't see anything wrong with using songs from the Desert Sessions, because they're often very good and go well with the rest of the CD.  <br /> <br />Besides that, I was pleasantly surprised when I first bought this CD, it usually takes me a while to get used to new albums but not this one. Granted it is a much less aggressive approach to music, especially after former bassist Nick Oliveri leaving the band. But each song manages to stick to the overall dark dreamy feel the album as a whole seems to have. My favorite songs include: \\"Someone's in the wolf\\", a fairly heavy arrangement balanced with piercing melodies on the guitars, similar to \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" and \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" on previous albums; \\"Burn the Witch\\" is another good one, consisting of a nice heavy marching rhythm that sandwhiches Josh Homme on bass and Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top on lead guitar's improvisations. Other songs worth noting are \\"Medication\\",\\"Tangled up in Plaid\\", \\"I Never Came\\" isn't bad,  and \\"\\"You Got a Killer Scene There, Man...\\"\\". <br /> <br />I certainly was not disappointed when I got this CD, and would recommend it to any fan of QOTSA. If you were hoping for more of the same then this might not be for you, but otherwise you can't go wrong.
B000002MP2|4.0|The first time I heard a Green Day song (Basket case) I thought it was annoying.  But then I kept on listening to the song on the computer and eventually I bought Dookie.  this cd is great, and also the cd that got me into punk rock.  I would recomend this cd to anybody.  I would also recomend American Idiot.  And for those people who say Green Day sucks, they obviously are immature people who criticize everything that they don't like.  If you don't like something, don't bother giving it a review.  Geez, even I knew that and I'm 11.  Don't say I'm stupid for saying that, that will just show more immaturity.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is not a typical business writer. He doesn't package common sense bromides into check lists for success. Instead, he observes, ties together disparate anecdotes, and he comments. He expects the reader to think, not just passively accept wisdom from on high. Like a good coach or teacher, he doesn't provide answers, he offers insights and suggestions. <br /> <br />Blink asks us to consider whether -- and if so, when -- intuitive analysis trumps data-driven analysis. I found the book refreshing and even encouraging. Again, it doesn't offer a checklist for success, but it might make a discerning readers wonder how often they hide behind spreadsheets and presentations instead of trusting their gut and taking action. <br /> <br />Those expecting a sequel to the Tipping Point will be disappointed. This is a new work with new questions and observations. However, like the Tipping Point, Gladwell makes the inquiry interesting and very readable. Highly recommended for businesses large or small.
1400031087|4.0|The book cover drew me in. The first page immobilized me. It led me down its rickety staircase without so much as a handrail. I was taunted to go further at the end of each page. When you meet James Frey--a bloody mess of a man missing his four front teeth, a hole in his cheek, broken nose, and no recollection of what happened, where he's going, or how he got on this plane, you're just as baffled. <br /> <br />You enter rehab with him and experience the intensity of cold turkey after more than a decade of drug use. He provides the merciless details--never romanticizing drug use and never sparing the reader--about his struggles with addictions to almost all illegal substances. You meet his cohorts in rehab, learn about the house rules, and experience the personality conflicts. You get to know Frey and his stubbornness. You feel his pain, his losses, and his constant rage. When the story is finally pieced together, you see how at 23, he was rabid, just waiting for anyone to test him. <br /> <br />I couldn't put down this memoir. The left justified text, the short sentences, the Germanic capitalization, and the brutal pain doesn't stop shaking you, until about  into the book. At this point, the ride calms. Is it because up to this point, you're riveted and overwhelmed by all the chaos, by such voyeuristic detail into the crimes, the desperation, the lack of control, that when it evens out, you're going nuts and experiencing your own withdrawal? <br /> <br />If you love dark, unpredictable books that don't spare you, this is the ride for you.
B00065GX64|5.0|This is more a review for the justice Criterion has done for Frtitz Lang's 1931 criminal masterpiece than it is a review of the film.  Chances are if you're reading this review, your already have an interest in this film and have heard of how incredible it is, so therefore an in depth study of it from some amateur film buff like me will do you little or no good.  Just see it and you'll know all you need to know about what makes it an unmistakebale clasic.   <br /> <br />My hat goes off (if I wore one) to the Criterion Collection, who have released an amazing print of this movie.  Not only are the German subtitles more involving and in depth, making the story easier to follow and all the expressions easier to understand, but the actual footage you see is so clear it is hard to believe this film is over 70 years old!  Even Kurosawa's IKIRU from the 1950s doesn't have such a high quality print available!  I've watched this film for several years (almost 10 now--since I was a teenager) and every time I see a new version of it, from video to DVD, it gets better and better.  The version Criterion presents is easily the longest of them all, and following the feature a breif description of the restoration and the time is presented just so you realise you've seen as close to the original film as you possibly can.  The other versions of this movie that I've seen were all shabby, at best.  I remember in 98 or 99, a video was released of the film that at the time was one of the most complete available, including the short finale just after the criminal kangaroo court scene, which had been deleted for many years.  Not only is that scene included in this DVD, but it is presented much more clearly, with much a better translation available.  Before, I'd thought that extra scene felt out of place, and now I know why;  it hadn't been handled properly.  Thanks to Criterion's amazing job completing this classic, its being shown that way it should be.
0156027321|1.0|Quite honestly, this book is among the worst I have ever read. How it received a literary award is completely beyond me. The first part of the book was actually moderately interesting, when Pi was beginning his spiritual journey. I found the apparent contradiction of a person living as a perfect Muslim, Catholic and Hindu to be thought-provoking and charming. The author completely changes courses, and doesn't make any attempt to connect the spiritual quest with the quest for survival. Was this too obvious? I don't think so. It is never explained how living on a lifeboat with a hungry, dangerous predator kept Pi alive. It becomes virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. The author also can't resist the urge to shock and disgust the reader. This is not clever. It's just plain dumb. Let me just say one thing about the \\"second story\\", which so many other reviewers seem to be so enthralled with. If it was true, it would be inconceivable to tell the first story. If it is untrue, only the basest person in the world would be able to tell it, considering the fate that befell his mother. As told by an impassive, unemotional victim. I truly felt sick to my stomach, it was so vile. <br /> <br />You may be wondering why I finished this book, since it was such a turd. I am certainly not proud of it. My explanation is that I got past the point of no return, and continued on out of habit more than anything else. After finishing, I considered putting it through the shredder, but I think that would be tantamount to censorship. I wouldn't recommend it to a single person, but I really do want to get it out of my house. Go ahead and read it, but consider yourself warned. This book is awful.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney Spears is over sexed, over produced, over payed and just plain over. If her increasingly bizarre publicity stunts tell you anything, its that she's on her way out. Her record company knows this and are cashing in on her career before it fizzles out like a bad fart. Not so silent but deadly. <br /> <br />No soul, substance or heart. This is money music. One more get rich quick record company scheme that worked. Don't you feel cheated? Not just for those who bought Britney's albums but for those more deserving artists who were ignored in favor of big breasted bimbos like Britney.  <br /> <br />In a few years, Britney will probably be out of the mainstream and perhaps forgotten. She fits the young pop star archetype to a T. She gets famous off other people's songs and studio magic. Then the public gets sick of her and she goes off into oblivion. Eventually, all that will be left of Britney will be a pretty face, plastic body and that obnoxious voice. <br /> <br />Britney's greatest hits didn't sell so well. The public is already getting sick of her strange antics. A band like Guns and Roses charted their greatest hits compilation at #3 on the Billboard 200. And they are 10 years gone. Real music has staying power. That's why we still talk about Mozart and Beethoven hundreds of years after they died while Vanilla Ice is nothing but the butt of jokes. That's why I don't see Britney having the brightest future in the music business.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I just viewed this movie last weekend, and finally I get to see a better portrayal of the religious story.   <br /> <br />I understand that Jesus in the stories is beaten and scourged before his crucifixtion, so there has to be a movie where we get to view Jesus finally experiencing pain.  Of all the films that have been made on the passion, this one is the most accurate, but still not perfect. <br /> <br />What's wrong with it?  How about the retarded little things Mel Gibson inserts, like the devil, or small children chasing Judas Iscariot.  What a fluke, I laughed my butt off at that part. Just stick to the official stories of the bible there Mel.  Your just proving that religion is worthless and can be rewritten as stories just like that.  Also the dropping of Jesus off a bridge was funny.   <br /> <br />One last thing I'd like to point out is the terrible scourging of Jesus.  At first it was believable, but after they used those inch and a half hook whips that dug into the table, but still only managed to rip Jesus' skin off after about 70 or so whipings was absolutly mental.  I know for a fact with those whips, they would've ripped all his flesh on his back right off the bone.  Terrible terrible, it would've killed him.  But still, he manges to stand up and carry, probably more than 100 pound big piece of wood, WHILE enduring more whippings, beatings, nails in his hands and feet AND without any hydration.   <br /> <br />*rolls eyes*  <br /> <br />Did I mention Jesus is still a white man from the Middle East?  *cough* <br /> <br />Watch this for its take on the STORIES in the bible written by men, not for historical content.
B000084T18|1.0|I never got the appeal of 50 cent. Ya, he's a gangster, he's been shot nine times. What's that supposed to mean? Is our society so twisted that being a gangster is a unit mover? Oh ya, dissing Ja Rule is not groundbreaking or funny. Everybody does it.  <br /> <br />Sure, 50 cent can rhyme. So can most rappers. I don't see anything spectacular about his wordplay. His rhyme structure is pretty basic too. People have complained about his rapping. But I actually prefer his mumbling. That way I can't make out his inane lyrics. Yes, we know he's a thug. It makes songs like 21 questions all the faker. <br /> <br />Imagine 50 cent without the beats. Boring. Thats what would happen if 50 cent didn't have Dr. Dre. Bleak, isn't it? Let's look at the super mega hit In Da Club. Without those catchy two note orchestrations, 50 cent just looks and sounds stupid(not that he is smart anyways).  <br /> <br />50 cent is just rather mediocre. I don't feel he is worthy of the multi million record sales he has garnered. I just so happen to like music with more substance. It's 100% OK if you feel differently.  <br />  <br /> <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is a must own album for every <br />thrash/death metal fan. <br /> <br />When I first heard this album it <br />blew me away by the phenominal <br />musicianship between the guitars, <br />drums,bass and vocals.They are one <br />of the best thrash/death metal bands <br />out there right now. <br /> <br />You can also tell who they're influences <br />are.I hear alot of Slayer,Fear Factory, <br />Hatebreed and any death metal band who <br />have strongly influenced Lamb of God. <br /> <br />Lamb of God's music is very technical <br />and diverse. <br /> <br />I now own this album and it is in my <br />cd player in my car all the time. <br /> <br />I can't get enough of it. <br /> <br />Buy this album,it's amazing!!! <br />
B00078XKDE|4.0|<br />I bought this not even a week ago, and i've been hooked on it mostly, even though the same day i bought last albums by Low, 50ft Wave and Cat Power's dvd.  <br />Critics keep being a little sceptic with them and keep talking about what a huge debt the singer has with Pj Harvey, which i think is not true; if it wasn't for critics her name maybe would have never occured to me. I do find The Kills closer to Boss Hog, those who nkow this band be sure that The Kills are gentler and groovier than \\"Boss Hog\\" and not as much as \\"Whiteout\\". They admit Royal Trux have had a huge influence on them as well, but i've never listened one of their albums. <br /> <br />Anyway, i think this is a great record with lost of catchy tunes, bluesy feeling and sexual urgency that can take your breath away. \\"No wow\\", the song, is a great album starter, a sustained note, an awesome atmosphere and believe it great lyrics; i don't know why but it reminded me of the title piece of Sleater-Kinney's \\"One beat\\", which also started their album. Anyway. Very good <br /> <br />Stand out tracks: No wow, Love is a deserter, The good ones, Rodeo Town, Sweet cloud...but the whole lot is awesome.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Anyone who thinks Journey can't survive without Steve Perry should think again. As the live dvd \\"Journey 2001\\" proves, the band has not lost its edged, especially thanks to lead singer Steve Augeri (who my cousin is great friends with and even wrote a song with him on the band's upcoming album - I'm not joking).<br /><br />In this 106 minute live show, the band blasts through all their classics - \\"Open Arms\\", \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\", \\"Any Way You Want It\\", \\"Faithfully\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and so much more! The band sounds just as good as it did 20 years ago. Anyone who blasts Steve Augeri's voice should take a second listen. I mean, he sounds exactly like Steve Perry. It's just as good! And besides, as one reviewer pointed out, Perry was a bit of jerk sometimes.<br /><br />This is a such a great dvd. My only wish is that they would have performed \\"After The Fall\\", \\"I'll Be Alright Without You\\" and \\"When You Love A Woman\\" but the dvd is pretty full there probably wouldn't have been enough room. This is still a great dvd.
0064400018|5.0|My wife and I read these books aloud to our niece when she was 10 and 11.  It was a wonderful experience.  Everyone in the U.S.A. should read these books at least once.  In order.  They should be included in American litereature survey courses with Mark Twain and Hemingway.  (My niece and I have never seen the TV show.  My wife read the books and then saw the show and loved it.)<br /><br />There are two parallel stories in these books.  One is the story of Laura growing up, becoming a teacher and getting married.  This is the kids' story, and it is excellent.<br /><br />The other is the story of Pa as seen through Laura's eyes.  This is the grown-ups' story.  Pa keeps the family moving in search of a better life.  He builds houses, clears forests, takes odd jobs, grows crops and shoots game.  He rises to every deadly challenge, including grasshoppers and the long winter.  With his fiddle and his stories he keeps his family's spirits up in dark times. We last see Pa giving away his \\"little half pint\\" in marriage. (I could not read that part aloud.  Wasn't tough enough.) We can't help but compare Laura's husband, a mere human, to her father, who never failed his family.  We as grown-ups can't help but compare our relatively easy lives to the hard scrabble lives of Ma and Pa.  Pa is this grown-up's hero.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Long before he was on trial for child mollestation, Michael Jackson was a musical genius. (He was also black and had a nose). The four disc boxed set \\"Michael Jackson - The Ultimate Collection\\" stresses that point as far as it could possibly go, and while it isn't perfect it's great primer for most fans.<br /><br />Over four discs, you'll the hear the evolution of Jackson's music, from his days with the Jackson 5 through the \\"Thriller\\" era rigt up to today. You'll get to hear almost of all of Jackson's biggest and best known songs, a partial list of which would include \\"ABC\\", \\"I'll Be There\\", \\"Ben\\", \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\". Also included are many surprise inclusions such as \\"Lovely One\\", \\"This Place Hotel\\", \\"State Of Shock\\" (with Mick Jagger), \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\" and \\"Beautiful Girl\\". The live dvd is amazing as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that a lot of good songs have been left off. There are too many too list, but they include \\"The Love You Save\\", \\"Rockin' Robbin\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T.\\" (the album version, not the demo), \\"Another Part Of Me\\", \\"In The Closet\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\". Also, I didn't really like the unreleased tracks.<br /><br />These qualms aside, this is an excellent collection of Jackson's best. Let's hope he's exonerated from his current charges and makes more great music in the future.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Very good movie with great performances by Smith and Greenwood. <br /> <br />Another play on the bad robot/good robot, bad cop/good cop <br />era, obviously borrowing a lot from films like \\"Android\\" <br />with Klaus Kinski and \\"Blade Runner\\" <br /> <br />Robots are hot idea in Hollywood with everything from the new <br />\\"Robots\\" film with Halle Berry to the old early days of robots <br />like Metropolis. <br /> <br />Proyas is becoming an expert in this type of genre, hopefully <br />will see more to come from him. <br /> <br />Two thumbs up for \\"I, Robot\\"!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|We (Campus Crusade for Christ) just watched this movie today (Good Friday) to put into perspective Jesus's sacrifice for all of mankind. <br /> <br />We can go ahead and live our Christian lives and hardly imagine all that Jesus went through, even if the passion and the resurrection are the cornerstones of our faith. This film graphically portrays all the pain Jesus had to undergo, enabling us to better understand what was meant by the words \\"This is my blood which will be given up for you.\\" It enables us to look at how the sufferings of one man leads to eternal life for all of mankind. <br /> <br />The whole story is historically accurate; the gospels give you the same story. Most of all, the emotions that are elicited by the picture are indescribable; you can almost tell which people in the crowd that gathered to see it have never seen it before because the reactions were just incredibly sorrowful. The final scene turns all of that around, enabling us to re-focus on the resurrection and new hope. <br /> <br />Overall, Christian watchers will be taken away from the very beginning. But those who are not very familiar with the Christian faith are in for another experience, as a lot of doctrines come into play and it can get a little difficult to digest. Overall, I left the room speechless. Period. It took me a while to get over myself. Now I'm here telling you all about it.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|South Park creators Parker and Stone have outdone themselves with this puppet show inspired in it's appearance by the wonderful Gerry Anderson \\"Supermarionation\\" TV show from the 1960's, Thunderbirds (available on DVD if you've never seen it). However, beyond the puppets and model aircraft, this show is nothing like a Gerry Anderson kids' show. The humor ranges from making fun of poor quality movies and bad acting to slamming extreme political views on both the right and left, and does a great job throughout the entire range.<br /><br />The only flaws in this film seem to come in the same area that is a problem in some episodes of South Park, which is that there is no self-restraint at all and some jokes are just crude or gross without being particularly clever or funny. However, those few scenes that left me and the rest of the audience cringing or silent were far outweighed by the ones where we laughed very loudly and for quite some time. Examples of some great moments are:<br /><br />-A whole song devoted to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was, how it missed the significance of that tragic event, and what a mediocre actor is Ben Affleck.<br /><br />- The awkardness of the puppets. Gerry Anderson used to go to great lengths to hide how funny it looked when the puppets walked, but Parker and Stone closely show you just how awkward the puppets are when walking and doing other human activities (e.g., having sex), to great comic effect.<br /><br />- Team America is eager to do good, but they \\"break\\" a lot of stuff doing it, often doing more damage than the bad guys they are chasing.<br /><br />- The song during the closing credits. It's hilarious, so be sure to stay through the credits and keep your ears open.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, this is one of the sharpest comedies to come along in a while. The DVD version is loaded with extra features including \\"making of\\" documentaries about the process used for creating and animating the puppets. Go Team!
B00004W52U|5.0|Energy is one of those CD's you'll never forget.  Look at the top of this page.  So far there are 110 reviews, and it still has five stars.  We've definitely discovered something here.  Reviewing each song is pointless (plus theres 27, so it would take a while) because every one is good.  You can't even try to hate any songs.  Songs like Vulnerability and Unity really hit home with America's state right now.  I don't really know what else to say, except that Operation Ivy is something you've never heard before, and the chances of discovering something like this again in your lifetime is slim to none.
0783219695|5.0|This movie is so much more inhanced in the IMAX experience.  I just attended a viewing of the movie at my local IMAX in Hutchinson, KS and was totally impressed and overwhelmed with the emotion of the film on an IMAX.  With my tour of the Cosmosphere and seeing all of the Apollo artifacts that NASA has gracously given to us to carry on history to our children, it has made me more connected to our past history of space exploration.  I hope that if anyone can get to an IMAX that they go because there will not be a dry eye in the house.  As for my copy of Apollo 13 I will cherish it for as long as I don't where it out.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Leonard DiCaprio (Titanic, Gangs Of New York) portays legendary director and aviaton designer Howard Hughes who was plummeted into a world of lies, sex, conspiracy and his own inner demons. Throughout the movie we see what really happened behind the scenes and during his own life as he tries to make his name a gargantuan one as he builds the largest aircrafts ever designed and dating famous actresses. There's a star studded array of cast here and their all perfect even if some of them dont get that much screen time. Cate Blanchett (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) channels Hepburn with honest truth, Kate Beckinsale (Underworld '03, Van Helsing) plays Ava Gardner with sass and Gwen Stefani (lead singer of No Doubt) is cute as Jean Harlow. Alec Baldwin (The Cooler, The Edge) plays the owner of Pan-Am, Alan Alda (tv's MASH, Canadian Bacon) plays Senator Brewster who questions Hughes on trial. John C. Reilly (Criminal, The Perfect Storm) and Matt Ross (American Pyscho, PCU) play Hughes friends and co-workers. It's a long movie, yes but I really liked this movie a lot and it gives DiCaprio one of his best performances so far. Scorsese hits on all cylinders here and after its done you just want more of Howard Hughes but I think it ended satifyingly enough. Also starring Edward Herrmann (The Lost Boys, The Shaft), Brent Spiner (Star Trek: Fist Contact and Nemesis), Ian Holm (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, The Sweet Hereafter) and this is the 6th film that has Jude Law (Alfie, Closer) in it this fall. The crash scene where Hughes gets injured crashing into the buildings just shows how good DiCaprio is.
0800141849|5.0|I think a few people here are missing the point that Bridges was attracted to her (in more ways than one) when she was plain...not just after her transformation. This movie was sad/funny/intelligent. With everyone so obsessed these days with physical appearance, I found the twist on their romance to be refreshing.
B0006399FS|1.0|They sure know how to milk their fans!  After 1991's brilliant Achtung Baby they've been releasing sub-par albums, Bono's still in his \\"I am God\\" phase and the band charges ridiculous prices for their concerts ($160-$49.50 where I live).  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb isn't worth $10 or even $1.  It's a waste of money, just like everything they've done after Achtung Baby.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is one of my fav Britney albums, besides Toxic. I think she's shed her \\"teeny bop\\" image well and is making more serious and fun albums. You can dance to a lot of these songs and she sounds great in all of them. And I must disagree with others that say \\"I love Rock N Roll\\" is a bad cover. Sure Britney aint no Joan Jett, but she made it sound pretty good in a pop version of it. I give my girl Britney props :) This entire album is awesome especially \\"i'm a slave 4 u\\" that song is sexy and i can dance to it seductively grinding against my boyfriend at a club. Buy this album you won't regret it!
B000092Q4U|5.0|is what I kept telling myself. I'm 26 and have been into death metal for about 10 years. The scene has been stagnant for sometime and I heard so much about these guys, I'd figure I try it. To clear up any misconceptions, this certainly isn't death metal (no blast beats, solos, or death inspired lyrics), but its just metal, pure and simple. Its not perfect though, the songs seem a little repetitive, drums are very low in the mix, and once again, no solos, BUT I can't keep this thing out of my cd player. I must admit this is one of the very few cd's where I don't skip any songs. And I don't have any particular favorite song b/c they mesh very well. If your like me and love death metal and are afraid of what your friends may say b/c they see you like LoG, let them listen, they'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|The new Judas Priest is probably one of the most anticipated metal releases of the year 2005.  This is the due to the fact that Rob Halford once again is fronting the group on lead vocals.  Yes indeed, the \\"Metal God\\" has returned to the group after successful Solo endeavors with both \\"Fight\\" and \\"Halford\\".  While he also had the group \\"Two\\" with Trent Reznor, it's impact/success are at best questionable.  In his absence the band continued along for 2 albums with the talents of Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens (now of Iced Earth) on the microphone.  Each group continued to bring metal to the masses in the best fashion possible.  However, the impact on either side was not felt as much as one would expect.  When news came of Rob Halfords return - ripples were felt across the metal community.<br /><br />There is very little that will disappoint the listener on the new Judas Priest CD entitled \\"Angel Of Retribution\\".  The radio track of \\"Revolution\\" is perhaps the weakest of the tunes throughout the piece.  It sounds very similar to the Jane's Addictions \\"Mountain Song\\" but with some different solos and vocals.  The remainder of the disk is very strong as there are hints of \\"Painkiller\\" as well as \\"Stained Class\\".  The band has not deferred from their history but instead used it well in the molding of ideas for their newest work.  For many fans, Judas Priest was the band that kicked off the term Heavy Metal, building on the blocks forged by Black Sabbath several years previous.  Seeing their creativity still vibrant after 30 years in the business shows why they are held in such high regard.  If you choose to listen to this CD expecting the next \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" or \\"Exciter\\" you will do yourself a disservice and it will prevent you from enjoying the CD.  I say this as a Priest fan from as far back as 1978.<br /><br />Among the standout tracks are \\"Hellrider\\", \\"Judas Rising\\", and  \\"Deal With The Devil\\".  They are heavy and have amazing drumming from Scott Travis as well as the dual guitar wizardry of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton.  On songs like \\"Angel\\" and \\"Lochness\\"  we see Rob's voice showcased to a different level.  His rich yet powerful harmonies and range are outstanding on these tracks.  Those seeking only heavy tunes will most probably overlook these.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the band has included with this CD a bonus DVD that features several tracks from last year's performances.  The band did choice dates as well as being featured on the ever popular Ozzfest.  Mixed in with the DVD is interview footage which is nice, I would have preferred the chance to view the complete concert minus the talking but that is not an option.  The CD comes in two versions, the version I am discussing is the Dualdisc.  The CD and DVD are on one piece and this is perhaps the wave of the future on music being sold.  There is also a digibook edition, which looks very nice and has the CD and DVD separate.<br /><br />I really recommend this CD for there is no reason for metal fans to avoid it.

B00000292K|4.0|This album's flawed no doubt and can get a bit over-indulgent but this is Jazz Funk for the new millennium. It was ahead of its time when it was first issued in 1972. It still is.  <br /> <br />No one anticipated musical trends better than Miles and this albums is proof. His underlying use of of Indian motifs, raw funk grooves and corruscating electronica prefigured everything from Shakti and Weather Report (post Mysterious Traveller)to Trilok Gurtu's eclectic blend and acid jazz. <br /> <br />It may not be a landmark like Bitches Brew but this is essential to understand where Miles and Jazz was headed. <br />
0060958324|5.0|I enjoyed the book, like any good trip. Below is my own version, not like the book but I aint no Pirsig and I do not apologize for this fact.Enjoy the book, wipe the philosophy from your feet  and then relax with another good book. I'd recommend my autobiography published on Amazon.com  Kind Regards    It was around 1971/72  that I first discovered an alternative to how to determine if your motorcycle had spark or not. I credit my brother Charles Chadwick with this revelation and I will soon explain. This was in the days of Nixon's Watergate, Hunter S Thompsons prime, Dark Side of the Moon's debut and me learning once again that my brother cared so much about me as to teach me to trust no one.     I had been riding bikes for awhile and being a child of nine/ten I cant blame myself for being ignorant of the workings of a two stroke internal combustion engine. I knew how the  method of testing for spark if your bike would not start, just take the plug out lay it on the head and kick her over, you see spark you have spark.  Good ole Chuckles ever mindful of my education taught me a shocking method of discovery.        This was along time ago so patience please, my bike would not start, I did everything I knew mechanically to diagnose the problem. The bike had gas, the fuel petcock was turned to the on position. I checked for spark...nothing. Chuck came to my rescue and started to work on my bike kick it over and over as if it could be flooded, mumbled a number of ridiculous hypothesis why my bike would not start, then I should have recognized that dreadful glint of discovery in his eyes, he had a solution. \\"Josh hold onto the plug while I kick it over I need to check something\\"...Although my last Doctors visit did not indicate I am in imminent peril of going into cardiac arrest  , I learned  from my beloved brother at the tender age of nineish what it must feel like when you hear from the cold distance a paramedic yell CLEAR! A shocking revelation, and a lesson welllearned.      Travel through time abit to 1976 and I am riding in North Carolina with me Da and my brother, we always visited in the summers and Christmas since this was where my grandparents lived. Always a good time and always a good story , if I could only remember them all. This year it was Christmas and me da had the state of the art  Yamaha 1976 360 mono-shock motocross bike. Set him back a pretty penny, I agreed not to go to college so he could indulge himself. The bike was awesome! I being a prime example of neoteny could only ride the bike if someone would start it for me and then I would run along side  it and jump on when I felt I could balance the beast.  The thing was a brute but my god what a blast, I can still can feel the power and glee piled upon glee and...Where was I?...Yea North Carolina, me da, Chuckles (Charlie does not like this nickname, nor do I like being shocked by a live spark plug, paybacks)  were out   riding on  public land, a big sand field really, I dunno, this was 1976 for crying out loud and lawyers/environmentalists  had not gained a foothold on the proper methods to bleed us of our freedom to ride around and have fun. Me da took a break, gassed up his new 360 and then promptly could not start the thing. So being the father of my gene pool he naturally pulled the plug on the bike and laid it on the head to check for spark, which it did indeed have and the bike suddenly fired up, not in the traditional way but in the way when kicked over a bike reeking of gas and set a live spark to it will fire up... I missed all the excitement , the futile efforts of throwing  sand on the burning pyre of sport , the profanity and the facial expressions, National Geographic cover  worthy facial expressions one can imagine. I road back only to find that the nitrogen shock had exploded and it was pretty cool but not worth the price of admission me da assured me.  We drug our bikes  home that Christmas the blackened carcass of the 360 among them andlistened to the truckers and the hip crowd with CB's make comments     on the two bikes with the charred remains of something...My mom was a good sport , my da did not cry (at least in front of me) and for awhile ole Chuckles and myself had to share our bikes with Da.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|Don't egt me wrong -- I LOVE this CD but the qualityof mine is appalling -- it is like  real cheap radio. Problem is I cannot retuen it as I ordered it but gave it to hubby to give to me for our anniv...which just was. <br /> <br />The DVD is great but the quality is really poor...like a scratchy cheap radio. I cannot return it to Amazon as the 30 day limit has expired ---lesson -- don't buy too far ahead. <br />I usu am happy with Amazon and I understand their returns but really-- for a defective DVD just a month or 2 after the \\"date\\"...... <br /> <br /> <br />I think this is really rank. I would order another copy and just eat the cost but what is to say this one will be OK??!!! I have tried on 2nd TV/DVD and friends' DVDs -- same result. <br /> <br />Return yours if defective and if a gift, open and test first -- probably made offshore and we pay i guess. lesson - don't order too far ahead for gifts and test test test!!!!! <br /> <br />pamm
B000003TA4|5.0|Do not read pointless 1 star reviews with &quot;Nevermind&quot; because here's what you really need to know:<br />1)  &quot;Nevermind&quot; is one of the most original and exciting rock CD's ever recorded. (1991 release)<br />2)  The mainstream back then was actually somewhat good since rock was the #1 music on the airwaves and you had bands like Metallica, Soundgarden, Guns N Roses, Pearl Jam, and Alice In Chains all in their primes.<br />3)  Nirvana did NOT kill the music industry.  The fact is every band who has come after them has totally sucked in trying to duplicate their sound.<br />4)  Did I say it's original? Unlike now with us living in the dark ages of music.<br />As for &quot;Nevermind&quot;, you can easily listen to the entire album as a whole.  The first half of this album is literally perfect and the second side is nearly as good.  The obvious classic is &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; but evey other song is just as strong.  This CD put grunge on the map along with Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot;, and Soundgarden's &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;. A definite must buy.
B0000047CW|5.0|See John Warshawsky's review above, he obviously knows what he's talking about.  This is one of those essential albums for any jazz collection.  First off, it's a masterful album, every song fits, and in order, this is the way albums used to be constructed before the day and age of progammable CDs.  I find a lot of people my age know the old records were better than new CDs, but aren't sure why, well that's a big reason, the attention they used to pay to the order and mix of songs on an LP, and it doesn't get any better than this one.  Second, this is an historic album in that it introduced the Brazilian bossa nova-samba, faster than 120-beats-per-second sound, to North America, and Europe (and Japan) and from there (or then) it became a jazz staple genre.  This was the era that saw the end of WWII big band music give way to \\"cool\\" small combo jazz, and Brazilian samba became the \\"other\\" Latin style jazz (in addition to the \\"hot\\" Afro-Cuban jazz coming out of Bebop).  So the third reason this CD is a jazz classic is that it represents jazz greats Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd at their best.  If you're new to jazz, try this out.  If you're a fan of Brazilian music, see what Americans did with it.  If you're a smooth jazz fan, try out some of this real jazz, you may never go back to the elevator music.  If you want to set a \\"cool\\" mood for a party, a coffee shop, a restaurant, or your office, slip this into your working collection.  If you're a saxophone or guitar musician or music student you really must own this CD.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|I saw the movie in the theater and was somewhat disappointed.  I am thoroughly enjoying the DVD however.  The extra features alone make it worth the purchase.  It seems, too, that time has changed my impression of the movie itself.  I don't know whether I had expectations too high or whether I was influenced by negative reviews which came out when the movie was in the theater.  I would recommend that Bridget fans purchase and enjoy the DVD.
B000002I53|5.0|Coltrane was God. Only he could take a show tune and fill it with sonic hurricanes and the kind musical dexterity on display here. Drummer Elvin Jones is a revelation and would be one of the most influential in jazz or rock. <br /> <br />This album also introduced the world to one of Jazz musics' greatest quartets. And one of the 3 greatest 60s jazz bands(the other 2 - Miles great mid 60s quintet with Wayne Shorter, Tony Williams..., and Ornette Coleman's early 60s quartet with Don Cherry) <br /> <br />This is essential to any jazz collection.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Could have been better.  Revolutions was really \\"Reloaded Part 2\\" and continued on with pretty much the same theme as the second film.   <br /> <br />One of the more surprising things about this film is that it attempted to resolve some of the issues that were raised in Reloaded (The true identity of Bane, Neo's real purpose etc ) and integrate such issues into a finale.  The philosophical issues of free will and fate came to a head in this film and we ultimately see what Neo has to \\"sacrifice\\" for the good of all. <br /> <br />As to the visuals, we are treated to a stunning  display of CGI with the invasion of the sentinels but little in the way of actual footage in the matrix itself.  It seems that Zion was the focus here and as such, most of the film takes place in this environment (the \\"Real world\\").  Overall this isn't a bad thing yet the inhabitants of this realm all look a bit jaded and depressed (lack of sunglight ?) and what's with them all being black ??? <br /> <br />Not a bad finish to a great trilogy.  Matrix 1 though still stands alone as one of the great Sci-Fi films.
B00005JMXX|2.0|But the special effects showing destruction and massive storm scenes make this poorly contrived movie almost worth watching.  Taking as the premise for the movie the hypothesis that melting ice cap in the north pole will redirect the gulf stream causing the rapid onslaught of a catastrophic drop of temperature in the northern hemisphere.  Even those scientists who find the gulf stream model plausible, will laugh themselves silly watching this movie.  The idea of some super-cold hurricanes creating a deep freeze up north is decidedly about as dorky and unscientific as young earth creationism.<br /><br />The plot, if you can call it that has Dennis Quaid playing a scientist whose warnings are ignored by the evil Vice President who looks a bit similar to that former head and current patron of Halliburton.  His son and his romantic interest are in New York for a contest and get stranded by the poor weather.  Lots of disaster scenes take place as storm swells take the Atlantic Ocean inland accross Manhattan.  Ultimately, Quaid tries to save his son.  Holed up in the library, rather than burn the wood furniture that lies all around, these geniuses start burning books including a Guttenberg Bible.  Now here is the fun part.  The front side of this hurricane manages get through Manhattan without too much severe cold, but after the eye of the storm appears, somehow they learn that a super chill is going to come with the back side of the storm.  I guess that swirling mass has different temperatures on either side of the storm.  Beam me up Scotty, because beaming up my particles make more sense than that.<br /><br />In short, this movie has some cool special effects.  You might have to totally turn off your brain to like this movie, though I have to admit watching Mexico trying to close their border to fleeing Americans was good for a laugh.  The ending has the newly inspired Vice President giving a very lame speech about environmental responsibility.  Pretty dumb.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.comon this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com
B00020HEL6|5.0|Let's put this review in perspective, since everyone else reviewing it seems to love this album.  I'm a serious jazz fan.  I'm a jazz snob.  Yes, I like Norah Jones, Diana Krall, and Doris Day, but I'm usually the kind of pretentious jazz lover who claims no one new will top the era of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday, and especially Sarah Vaughn, when it comes to the quality of voice AND the finesse of interpretation and phrasing.  I usually scoff at actresses cashing in on being physically cute by cutting a quick vocal album, I hope they're all embarassed in later life because most of them are only a shade better than William Shatner's \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"  I have only disdain for the likes of Britney Spears (yes she's a sexy dancer, but most church choirs have better singers), and the rest of the teen pop crowd, now and then (well the Spice Girls movie was kind of funny, but I'm talking about the music you see).  You know that out-of-control vibrato the Mariah Careys of the music world use to cover up the fact that they can't hit a precise note?  Makes me cover my ears in pain.  Okay, so you get the background, you know the kind of single-malt-scotch taste I've got, so you can put this final statement into proper context.  Renee Olmstead's album is wonderful!  Her singing is sultry, sexy, sensuous, with an amazing sense of style, timing, tone, dynamics and rhythm.  I have over 100 versions of \\"Summertime\\" in my collection, and Olmstead's interpretation shoots up right into the top 5.  Are you old enough to remember being turned on by Maria Muldaur's \\"Midnight at the Oasis?\\"  Okay, maybe you don't want to admit that, but somehow, this child's version of Oasis is even sexier!  How can this youngster have such a good sense of jazz timing?  Some of these songs absolutely require that the singer be at least 20 years older, 100 pounds heavier, with all the adult baggage and experience that entails.  And yet...she completely pulls it off. This CD is magnificent.  I don't actually know the television shows she's in, but I say, the heck with them.  She should give up her day job, and go for the jazz singing thing, judging by this CD she really could be the next, dare I say it?  Sarah Vaughn?  I think she's got the potential, buy the CD and judge for yourself. The one thing that bothers me is that Barry White-bedroom quality of her music, her CD is a real romantic mood setter, but...there's something basically wrong about feeling amorous listening to a child who's barely out of junior high...but I try not to think about that.  You certainly wouldn't know how young she is listening to the CD.  I just hope she has no idea about what \\"Meet me, Midnight\\" is about, but maybe I'm just being naive.ent.

This is an excellent thriller which is basically a big chase, including Kimble jumping off a verrrry high dam (and surviving) and various other good parts. i recommend this to anyone cause you cant hate it<br /><br />Kray Z187
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Shame on Sony! Fiona is by far the best lyricist in any genre. Her poetic flow and hard core pounding on the keys is true genius! If you can, find Extraordinary Machine, her yet to be released album for the past 3 years, online. With Fiona, you can not be disappointed.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is, by far, the best piece of cinema ever to hit the big screen. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done it again. Their brand of humor had me and the other five or so people in the theater laughing our heads off, (how could the theater have been so sparsely populated?). From making fun of Kim Jong Il and Michael Moore to funny songs, this movie has everything you could ever want, and if you don't see this movie several if not infinite times, the terrorists have won.
B00005V9IK|4.0|Even so, there are some interesting and appealing parts of this movie.  Many scenes and subplots are entirely unforgettable and the acting for many of the parts is sub-par, however this film works because it appeals to most people on a gut level.  The idea of people coming together to overcome overwhelming odds, all through their ability to look for and find unique solutions to a problem, resonates with most people and leads you to forget some of the more hoakey and stupid aspects of this movie.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum does a good job as the \\"cable repair guy\\" who saves the day through learning the aliens code and finding a way to use their code against them.  Bill Pullman as the President is good in some scenes and not so good in others.  Certainly not an oscar worthy performance.<br /><br />Like it seems all of Emmerich's movies, the best scenes are those showing cataclysmic destruction of cars, buildings, statues, etc.  My guess is that Emmerich has stepped on far more sandcastles than he has built.<br /><br />I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com
055321263X|5.0|This is an excellent novel. There is too much description, of course, but apart from that I can find no fault with it. The characters are well drawn, the plot in intricate and it unfolds as it should. Altogether a most satisfying read. I do have one question, however: The beginning is narrated by Sir Walter... and I do not see how he can be a Sir . Can anyone enlighten me? (dpolk@ashbury.on.ca)
B000096IB6|3.0|this is about a man called matt murdock ( ben affleck) who was blinded by toxic waste as a boy but still can tell whats around him, and with that he fights crime. the villains are bullseye played by Colin Farell and Kingpin (Michael Duncan Clarke) who try to take him down. He also meets a girl called Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) who likes him at first but after he is accused of killing her father, she tries to kill him. the movie is ok, and the action is good, but it isnt one of my favourites. Instead of buying it rent it cause it ain't really worth the money.<br /><br />KrayZ187
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview with the Vampire is a fine work of cinematography.  The script is well-written to be in concise correspondence with the book, Tom Cruise illuminates the screen with his presence as the dark, gothic Lestat, and the scenery wonderfully reflects the passing of time through the eyes of a vampire.  Neil Jordan once again creates a masterpiece that will overall be remembered for its vivacious and emotional characters as well as its accuracy to the original story by Anne Rice.  In bringing the characters to life, it was easier and so much more convincing to believe that they were vampires.  Aside from the sterotypes  brought on by past films such as Nosferatu and Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview with the Vampire seems realistic and authentic.  The audience is immediately placed in the late 1700's listening to the tale of Louis, played wonderfully by Brad Pitt, who's will to die is so real.  He had lost his wife and child, and he's praying for death, a perfect time for Lestat to intervene.  Of course, in the book Louis mourns over the death of his brother, but still the message of his suffering is that he had lost a close loved one, and this sets the stage for his eternal nightmare: to become an instrument of death by becoming a vampire.  He wants death and death comes to him.  Perhaps it wasn't what he specifically wanted, but now he has an eternity to contemplate this decision he makes. <br /> <br />So, the movie continues to explore the subject of death, and this is due to Louis' respect for human life.  Lestat confronts Louis multiple times in an effort to make him realize that he must take human life in order to survive.  This haunting revelation takes an odd turn when Lestat creates the child vampire, Claudia, played by the youthful Kirsten Dunst.  She becomes a vital part of the story due to her attachment to Louis, and her sinister ability to kill, despite her innocent form of an eternal child. <br /> <br />As a final statement, it is overall a masterpieceof its time.  It has become an essential part to the horror movie genre, specifically vampire films.  So have an open mind, a good taste in high quality cinematography, and enjoy Interview with the Vampire.
0440224764|5.0|this book is amazing<br /><br />i was enthralled by how smart patrick was and how he handled the money.<br /><br />this book is great, and i recommend it to anyone<br /><br />(even thought the ending is sort of oddly random)and not all that great  too b honest<br /><br />its still a great book overall.

B00070QXL8|3.0|The three actors in this film are three of my favorites but there wasn't much they could do with this really repetitive, uninspired sequel.  I loved the first Bridget Jones--the heroine was lovable because, while she wasn't a moron, she had foibles and encountered pitfalls that made the ordinary person able to relate to her. And there were some genuinely funny scenes that combined insight into character with physical humor.  Sad to say, the sequel has none of this.  Bridget is made to appear so unattractive that, unlike the first time around, one finds it hard to see what on earth Mark Darcy OR Daniel Cleaver see in her.  Moreover, her brain seems to have departed completely and she does things that are not only stupid but indicate that she doesn't learn anything from previous debacles, which is not the Bridget of the first movie.  Overall, the whole thing appears to be a group of not-very-funny pratfalls and idiotic scenes strung together without much rhyme or reason just to give us a second round of Bridget Does Thailand/ Ski Slope/ Elegant Dinner Party in hopes that we will bear her enough carried over good will to watch it. And we did, apparently, but I fear we were badly let down.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The way to watch this award winning FX TV show is one episode after another, but be prepared for graphic violence and rough language.  These are not the kinds of cops you grew up with.  Michael Chiklis stars as Det. Vic Mackey, who carefully toes the line between good and evil, and steps all the way across every so often.  Vic is the kind of cop you would want investigating a crime if you were the victim.  He is not the kind of cop you would want after you, because you will most likely end up robbed, beaten, dead or all three.<br /><br />Watching the entire series provides the viewer the luxury of watching not only for episode by episode contact, but the story and character arcs that cross from the first episode to the season finale.  Whenever it looks like Vic and the Strike Team are about to bite the dust, Vic finds a miraculous but plausible way out.<br /><br />When the show first came out I was somewhat offended and put off by the amoral/illegal behavior of the police.  But when Glen Close joined the cast in Season 4, I decided I needed to play catch-up to get up to speed and see what this show was really about.<br /><br />Each episode is its own gem.  Literally unlike anything ever on TV before.  Chiklis is mesmerizing to watch.  His Emmy is well deserved.  The rest of the cast are no slackers either.  Each one adds their own little something.  CCH Pounder is particularly watchable as a sage detective paired with the astute, but goofy Det. Wagonbach.<br /><br />This gritty show has to be seen to be believed, but it is no Adam 12.
B00003CWN3|5.0|After applauding Hilary Swank's Best Actress Academy Award for her role in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, I thought I'd better rent BOYS DON'T CRY, for which Swank also received an Oscar. Where have I been that I haven't seen it until now?<br /><br />Here, Swank plays Teena Brandon, a 21-year old woman with female genitalia but the sexual inclinations of a male. Ultimately, she'd like a sex change. In the meantime, she cuts her hair short, wraps up her breasts, pads the crotch of her jeans, renames herself Brandon Teena, and sets out to pick-up chicks. Now, in my corner of the world - Southern California - one could pull this off with panache. Trouble is, Brandon lives in Nebraska, and she eventually runs afoul of a couple of good ol' boys, John (Peter Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brandon Sexton), the former being the erstwhile boyfriend of Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the girl with whom Brandon develops a love relationship. The violence John and Tom eventually visit upon Brandon/Teena gives your average bigot a bad name, and reminds me why Nebraska is Flyover Country, especially when it's not pigskin season and the locals don't have Cornhusker football to keep them occupied. (Ok, ok. I admit I'm being unfair to Nebraska. After all, I'm not from Oklahoma and a Sooner fan.)<br /><br />Swank's role in BOYS DON'T CRY is, in many ways, grittier and incorporates more extremes of emotion than that in MILLION DOLLAR BABY. At times, I winced and slowly sunk down in my seat, much as I did as I watched Charlize Theron's bravura performance in MONSTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY never elicited that reaction. Here, Hilary elevates what might otherwise be a 3 or 4-star soap opera about the lives of trailer trash to 5-star heights.<br /><br />The sad part is that BOYS DON'T CRY is based on a true story. At the time the film was released, the real-life John and Tom were serving prison sentences. As for Teena, well, it's a shame she didn't live in a more tolerant, cosmopolitan environment. For some, the great empty space of America's Heartland is not the place to be.s Heartland is not the place to be.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|It took 6 weeks to make and it sounds like it. Very disappointing. I tried to get into it but daft punk just got lazy; however, they're not dead yet. Let's see if they can redeem themselves next album. I recommend the chems \\"Push the Button\\"  or plump djs \\"eargasm\\".
B00005JMCN|5.0|The film is slightly different from the book; but the feeling of the movie seems almost more authentic than the book.  The setting of the times was extremely successful; nothing felt 'cute' or 'designery' about the sets and tangibles of the depression and post depression era.  All of the actors brought their characters alive - and the horse is fantastic! <br /> <br />The racing sequences are quite exciting, except for close-ups of the jockeys (movie jockey's not the actual ones) and the wierd, rocking horse mounts.  But they were correct in putting in the actual footage of the races, because then you know this was a real occurrence, and not that long ago in history. <br /> <br />The story is also told from a popular psychology point of view: a runty, wierd looking little race horse, Seabiscuit, who was down on his luck at the time he was taken in and trained to be a champion (that he really always was deep down) like millions of Americans in the depression era- he came to represent the hopes and aspirations of many Americans who identified with him. <br /> <br />It's an upbeat story; ending well.  Unlike the book, which is also good, but in the book we learn how everyone really ends up which was not as fortunate as Seabiscuit.

0380715430|3.0|Having read Bill Brysons \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", I was looking forward to this read with a great deal of anticipation. <br /> <br />However, although it was a satisfactory and interesting piece, it never really lived up to what one has come to expect from this author. He tended to get bogged down in sturgy lists of words, and the finer points of pronounciation, in which there were several instances of innacuracy. The book became increasingly heavier going in the later chapters, and I found myself repeatedly skipping pages towards the end. <br /> <br />For anyone who wants to read a more accurated and scholary, but at the same time immensely readable review of this topic, look no further than Melvyn Bragg's \\"The Adventure of English\\".  <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I own all of the Queens album's and Lullabies is an awesome addition to their existing body of work.  Homme proves that even without Nick and Grohl (guest drummer on Songs...) he can still make a strong collection of songs that can stand up to any of the Queens previous works.

Pink also includes inspiring mini how to guides for building each of the six skills to help get you started.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|You just gotta love Nightwish. Once is a true breathtaking symphonic metal masterpiece. Tarja Turunen has got in my opinion one of the most beautiful singing voices ever along with Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil). Nemo, Wish I Had An Angel, Dark Chest Of Wonders, Creek Mary's Blood, The Siren, Planet Hell, Romanticide, and Ghost Love Score are my favorite songs on here. A must have for fans of symphonic metal or metal in general. Long Live Nightwish.
068987474X|1.0|this book really misses the mark.  it clearly lumps us men into a dumb, unemotional, self-absorbed category.  yet it preaches that women should be able to dump their man with no emotional consequences and that the relationship should revolve their every wants, needs and desires.  it speaks nothing of a mutually benefital relationship or a way to mend the problems plaguing the relationship, it's just dump him, dump him, dump him and oh i forgot to mention dump him.  the one star is given because it is great for holding the door open and also letting any jerry springer type women know they shouldn't date a married man.
014017821X|4.0|I think the stories are great, and much better than the movie adaptation, for sure.  Still, there's something about the style that does not make me feel like I'm reading a fairy tale.

B000000H66|5.0|Death created a good kind of death metal. Stuff that isn't like, \\"ROOOAAAARRRR!! I'M COOKIE MONSTER!!! I WANT BLOOD AND GUTS!!! I LIKE TO RIP OPEN PEOPLE'S INSIDES WITH A KNIFE! YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND ME SO I'LL SAY YOUR MOTHER IS A F**KING W**RE!!\\" Death is far from that. The guitar work is the best guitar work I have ever heard. Very melodic and easy to follow by. This isn't annoying stuff by Deicide or Cannibal Corpse. Those guys suck now. This is some stuff that brings back memories. \\"Zero Tolerance\\" is the first song I have ever heard from Death, and the guitar works brings me back to the days which I was only in the kindergarten, which is when this epic was released. I love each song off this record. R.I.P. Chuck Schuliner. You were the best damn death metal vocalist ever.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane, Keane, Keane!  Please buy this CD.  When I first listened to it, I'm ashamed to say that I thought it was slightly monotonous and boring.  But after a few more listens, I'm hooked.  Keane does sound a lot like Coldplay, only Keane is better!  Buy it... you won't regret it.  The best songs on here are #s 1, 2, 4, and 8 (I listen to #1 over and over)- but the others aren't too shabby!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I have read many of the reviews here online and felt the need to post one myself.  I truly believe people are getting way too into themselves after reading many of these reviews.  This show was enjoyable all the way through.  It was fun to watch, fun to get all the little (and the not so subtle) hints leading to the Wizard of Oz.  No, this musical will not go down as one of the greatest musicals of all time.  But, if that's the only standard that will please some of these people, I would hope the rest of us would not lean too heavily on their opinions.   <br /> <br />The CD probably won't make much sense to you if you haven't seen the show...but you can find a synopsis or two online that will help you figure it all out.  In all, this is a really neatly done story with excellent characters and excellent singers. <br /> <br />Now here's a kicker:  I went and saw this about two weeks ago.  The woman who is now doing the role of Elphaba, Shoshana Bean, is, in my opinion, better by far than the original.  She was such a joy to watch and listen to.  I know there's no way to display this on the broadway CD...but I figured I'd let you all know.  Go see it while she's in it.  <br /> <br />     If there is a weak part to this show, it's the Wizard's songs.  They seem out of place and rather ordinary.  The show would be exactly the same without them.  So, they're not horrible and needing to be chopped.  They're simply uninspiring.  The greatest thing about the CD...you can skip past them.  Other than that, the song \\"Defying Gravity\\" is one of the best songs I've heard in years.  As is \\"The Wizard and I\\" and \\"For Good.\\"  I can't stop listening to the three of them. <br />     In particular, \\"Defying Gravity\\" is an excellent song that really gets your heart pulsing, your feet tapping, and your voice singing along.  Add to that the drama and excitement you feel if you know what's going on in this scene on stage...it's awesome.   <br />     So, as my title says...go see the show.You'll enjoy the CD and the music regardless.  But the show makes the whole thing worth it.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Another great Rainbow-album. My favorite rainbow album is 'Rising' came out before this one, so I was very excited to get this album. So I spend some of my money were I worked very hard for, and I was very happy I did it, cause this cd is just GREAT! It starts off with 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, that track is fantastic! Second song called 'Lady of the Lake' is good too, but not as good as the first track. That ofcours doesn't mean that it isen't a good song, cause it is a very good one. Just as the third song&lt;'L.A. Connection'>, which is another very good song. And then a superb track: 'Gates of Babylon'. It's a little bit the style of 'Stargazer', but not as good. It is a highlight of this album, but 'Stargazer' is my favorite rainbow-song, so there's no other song that comes close to 'Stargazer'. <br /> <br />And then, my favorite song on this album: 'Kill The King'. A fast-rocker, and I always like fast-rockers, especially this one. This song has such a great guitarsolo and Ronnie's singing makes it superb. Ofcours, Ronnie sings very good with all songs. <br />And then track 6:'The Shed(subtle)', a very good metal song. Ronnie sings kinda agressive with this song, and I like that. He always sings with so much emotion, and here you can here that so well. 'Sensitive to light' is also a very good song, so far 7 great songs! <br /> <br />And then you get to hear 'Rainbow Eyes'. I didn't liked it when I heard it for the first time, and I've heard it so many times now, but I still don't really like the song, so if I now listen to the cd, I only listen to the first 7 tracks. 'Rainbow Eyes' is listenable, it is not a terrible song, it's just a bit boring. The song is also way to long. Lots of people like the song, I just don't, but that's my opinion. Everyone has a different taste. <br /> <br />So, as you've read, I really recommend this album.
B000002JS8|5.0|While I highly and I mean highly recommend this album to most everyone who loves powerful chords and a great vocalist with a high pitched voice, this album is by far NOT the best AC/DC album. This album, in my opinion of course, is the 3rd best AC/DC album. The best AC/DC album has got to be and will always be Back in Black with High Voltage a well deserved 2nd. After doing some research Back in Black is the 3rd best selling album of all time behind the greatest hits of the Eagles and The Wall by Pink Floyd. Numbers don't lie Back in Black is by far the greatest album AC/DC has put out.

B0002JP4L4|1.0|...and Bacon isn't just for breakfast anymore! LOL Well, anyway, this move is pretty bad.  The homoerotic overtones are about as subtle as a car crash...the church's close-minded response to the young man who only wants to take his buddy out in the fields or in the empty gym and hold his hands and gyrate to \\"Let's Hear It For the Boy\\"- man alive, give me a break!  At least they weren't wearing leg warmers, which is about the only 80's fashion statement they failed to use and overuse in this flick.  Sarah Jessica Parker shows us early on how un-talented she is, and the final scene, where kids who have heretofore never danced are able to look like the trendsetters on \\"Soul Train\\"- whatever genius thought this script up should definitely look into another line of work.  I hear McDonalds is hiring.

B0000524CY|5.0|This horrifying adaptation of William Blatty's the exorcist is a truly horrifying ride into the depths of hell and just truly startles and goes under your skin without letting up. <br /> <br />12 year old Regan has been acting strangely and her attitude has starting to change more and more disturbing and socialy unacceptable. After falling ill and having her body start to transform, her parents have no choice but to call in a preist, for fear her daughter might not be herself, but instead be the habitat for the devil himself! <br /> <br />Watch at your own risk. This movie has a lot of disturbing images, and there is some obsence language, and there is one extremely sickening scene which i think i should warn you about. Instead of giving you the whole scene, ill give you one word: CROSS. Keep that in mind and be prepared to be plunged into a horrifying journey.
B00004WG2X|1.0|I must say that I've been completely deceived by some of the reviews I've read. I'm sorry but I could only give it a generous 1 star for effort.This 1980 adaptation of pride and prejudice is the worst adaptation of any book I have ever seen. I've seen other book adaptation in the 80's and I've enjoyed most of them but this one just bored me to death.Everyone was acting in slow motion as if they were on stage.Correct me if I'm wrong but Pride and Prejudice was supposed to be a sparkling comedy but there is nothing sparkling in this adaptation.It was like a book reading without any feelings at all, I waited until the end to see if there is something that could redeem the film but it got worst.There is no comparison to the other PnP adaptation starring Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle. That one is much more superior than any other book adaptation I have seen so far.I dont think that it has anything to do with the budget or the extra one hour that, the performance of the whole cast was just much better than the ones in the 80s and even the supporting characters are better. I was inspired to read the book when i saw the 1995 PnP but the 1980 version did not impress me at all.It is close to the book sure because the characters just read the book during the entire film but the spirit was lost. The 1995 version was not only close to the book but it also captured the spirit of Jane Austen's most beloved novel.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Other gangsta rappers were all about aggression and anger -- even Dre, as a rapper, is as blunt as a thug -- but Snoop takes his time, playing with the flow of his words, giving his rhymes a nearly melodic eloquence. Compare his delivery to many guest rappers here: Nate Dogg, Kurupt, and Dat Nigga Daz are all good rappers, but they're good in a conventional sense, where Snoop is something special, with unpredictable turns of phrase, evocative imagery, and a distinctive, addictive flow. If Doggystyle doesn't surprise or offer anything that wasn't already on The Chronic, it nevertheless is the best showcase for Snoop's prodigious talents, not just because he's given the room to run wild, but because he knows what to do with that freedom and Dre presents it all with imagination and a narrative thrust. If it doesn't have the shock of the new, the way that The Chronic did, so be it: Over the years, the pervasive influence of that record and its countless ripoffs has dulled its innovations, so it doesn't have the shock of the new either. Now, Doggystyle and The Chronic stand proudly together as the twin pinnacles of West Coast G-funk hip-hop of the early '90s.
B00005R1N3|5.0|\\"...it's on to tight.\\"  Just seeing this movie for the first time in a few years, it still gave me the willies.  The thing that makes this movie so scary is probably the atmosphere.  The amount of creepy atmosphere in this movie is staggering.  This actually felt like it could really happen.  Many believe Halloween to be the first slasher.  I consider this to be, as it is just as good as Halloween.  This movie even has many similarities to Halloween, and was made four years before.  Oh, and the \\"killer in the house thing\\" was first done in Black Christmas, not When a Stranger Calls.  Halloween and When a Stranger Calls owe a lot to this movie (and so does basically every other slasher).   <br />   This movie is one of the scariest ever made, in my opinion.  The bleak winter atmosphere helps.  The killer POV shots are very scary (especially when the killer toys with his victims).  Oh, I also have to mention the phone calls.  The phone calls in this movie are the scariest phone calls ever (even better than the phone calls in When a Stranger Calls, even though those are pretty scary too).  You hear the killer take on different voices, such as a woman, baby, pig, etc.  The killer also learns frightening facts about the sorority girls and says them on the phone (very scary considering he's only upstairs in the attic).  The killer is one of the most maniacal I've ever seen.  The way he kills his victims (low on gore, high on brutality) and sets them up is downright creepy (the girl with the plastic on her head in the chair brrrr).  This movie also has a good blend of comedy, drama, and horror.  The comedy and drama aspects help you to feel for the characters, making their deaths more shocking.  Also, the very scary eyeball shot (you will know when you see it, trust me) is terrifying!  I also liked the ending, even though many people don't.  Not knowing about the killer makes him that more frightening.  If we found out his background info, and such, he wouldn't be as scary.  This isn't a type of killer like Michael Myers and Jason, who need a reason to kill.  The killer in BC doesn't need a reason to kill because he is like a real-life killer.  Real-life killers never have a motive to kill, you'll just hear about them walking into someone's house and stabbing them, and stuff like that.  This makes the killer seem more real, therefore making it feel this could really happen.  Anyway, this is the first (and best) slasher of all time.  It's also one of the best and scariest horror movies of all time.  Any horror fan who hasn't seen this movie yet (many people haven't ever heard of it), owes it to themseleves to check out this forgotten, criminally underrated flick.
B00029LNHS|4.0|Nominally a rap group, in truth Black Eyed Peas call on so many forms of songwriting and production that slotting them into hip-hop is like slotting Prince into R&B -- technically true, but very limiting. Elephunk, the group's third straight winning LP, doesn't have top-notch rapping, but as driven by frontman Will.I.Am, it does possess some of the most boundary-pushing productions in contemporary, uncommercial hip-hop -- right up at the level occupied by Common and OutKast. The smart, brassy opening club thump \\"Hands Up\\" hits another level with a sly bridge flaunting some heavy metallic slide guitar, while the highly pressurized love jam \\"Shut Up\\" features great interplay between Taboo and new member Fergie. Space doesn't allow for description of each track, but suffice to say any Will.I.Am track is going to feature loads of ideas and fresh sounds, not to mention plenty of stylistic change-ups -- from the digital-step ragga of \\"Hey Mama\\" (featuring Tippa Irie) to the Latinized, loved-up \\"Latin Girls.\\" Like a latter-day Digital Underground, Black Eyed Peas know how to get a party track moving, and add a crazy stupid rhyme or two.
B000002KHH|5.0|'Paranoid', Black Sabbath's second album, released in 1970 was a work like no other at the time of its release. The quartet of Ozzy Osbourne (vocals), Toni Iommi (Guitar), Geezer Butler (Bass) and Bill Ward (Drums) after their self titled debut at the turn of the '70's put together this heavy-metal work of art. Black Sabbath are rightly credited as the main band which pioneered the heavy metal sound - their style was very revolutionary for its time. They were light years ahead of quite a lot of bands and their heavy, powerful style was something which only became more commonplace towards the end of the 70's/start of the 80's. Perhaps the only contemporary early 70's bands which came close to their style was Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin (with some of their more heavier stuff) and a handful of other bands.<br /><br />You've gotta respect this band for the changing musical direction they started. At the time, they were heavily criticised by plenty of rather 'conservative' critics who really didn't know what to make of the band's music. Black Sabbath at the time were and sometimes still are misinterpreted as a band of devil worshippers when the reality is that the message they really portray in their music is that of a reaction to war, crime and plenty of other issues that trouble the world. People who often view Black Sabbath in a negative and suspicious light haven't listened to them (especially their lyrics) carefully enough and simply write them off. True, their style is quite dark on the whole but it is the ideal way to create the atmosphere for the lyrics. Atmospherics are definitely a strong point of Black Sabbath and you'll feel this when you listen to them and they have a very good knack at leaving gaps in their music (done to perfection in parts on Paranoid) which gives their music great suspense. There's very little to say about Ozzy Osbourne that lots of people haven't said, the man is a legend - unique as a vocalist. Couple this with the amazing power chords of Toni Iommi's guitar, the ever present bass lines from Geezer Butler and the great 'War Drums' style from Bill Ward and you have a much more than capable line up.<br /><br />Onto the album music itself. 'War Pigs' is a powerful, moving 8 minute opener about the ills of war and the 'game like' attitude of politicians. There's plenty of memorable riffs in this tune alone, great effects too and rounds off at the end with a whirlwind finish. 'Paranoid' follows this, a track that even people who have the remotest intetest in rock have heard. For me, this track is equaled by at least 4 other tracks on the album but its stands still as a testament to the heavy metal sound with Ozzy's echoing vocals sounding around a great but remarkably simple guitar riff. 'Planet Caravan' follows this and we have a change of mood here - Ozzy's vocals are more mysterious here and it makes a very haunting track. The song rounds off with a brilliant guitar solo - I can't understand why a lot of people diss this track, it adds another dimension to a great album and has great atmospherics. If things couldn't get any better, 'Iron Man' follows this - you hear the thudding at the start, followed by that ripper of a guitar chord then 'I AM IRON MAN!' brilliant - a great riff (again) characterises the track from then on with great vocals.<br /><br />The first half of the album is a monster start and then we have 'Electric Funeral', a bit downbeat in tone at the start but develops into another heavy rocker with some wailing guitar work in time to Ozzy's vocals. 'Hand of Doom' is more thoughtful but build into a good climax - listen out for the anti war references again - Ozzy makes his views heard on the Vietnam war, which was still happening at the time of the album. 'Rat Salad' is a drum showcase, reminiscent of 'Moby Dick' from Led Zeppelin II. A good break up track with some very good drumming from Bill Ward. 'Fairies Wear Boots' sounds out the album, a track which cleverly develops into different parts, a bit catchy - listen out for some great bass playing making a great thick texture to this track.<br /><br />As you can see, I have plenty to say about this album - cos its so so good. Never pass off this band, like other 70's bands, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, these guys are pioneers of a changing direction in rock and you never get tired of listening to them. A must for any metal fan.- listen out for some great bass playing making a great thick texture to this track.    As you can see, I have plenty to say about this album - cos its so so good.

B000023VR6|4.0|The Slim Shady LP announced not only Eminem's arrival, but it established that his producer Dr. Dre was anything but pass, thereby raising expectations for 2001, the long-anticipated sequel to The Chronic. It suggested that 2001 wouldn't simply be recycled Chronic, and, musically speaking, that's more or less true. He's pushed himself hard, finding new variations in the formula by adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae, resulting in fairly interesting recontextualizations. Padded out to 22 tracks, 2001 isn't as consistent or striking as Slim Shady, but the music is always brimming with character. If only the same could be said about the rappers! Why does a producer as original as Dre work with such pedestrian rappers? Perhaps it's to ensure his control over the project, or to mask his own shortcomings as an MC, but the album suffers considerably as a result. Out of all the other rappers on 2001, only Snoop and Eminem -- Dre's two great protgs -- have character and while Eminem's jokiness still is unpredictable, Snoop sounds nearly as tired as the second-rate rappers. The only difference is, there's pleasure in hearing Snoop's style, while the rest sound staid. That's the major problem with 2001: lyrically and thematically, it's nothing but gangsta clichs. Scratch that, it's ber-gangsta, blown up so large that it feels like a parody. Song after song, there's a never-ending litany of violence, drugs, pussy, bitches, dope, guns, and gangsters. After a full decade of this, it takes real effort to get outraged at this stuff, so chances are, you'll shut out the words and groove along since, sonically, this is first-rate, straight-up gangsta. Still, no matter how much fun you may have, it's hard not to shake the feeling that this is cheap, not lasting, fun.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|The theatrics and birth of the first staged version of \\"Peter Pan\\", including the first female actress to play Peter, is often overshadowed by the maudlin romantic drama that is the bulk of the film, in which the heroine coughs that fateful movie-death-cough and author J.M. Barrie goes frolicking through the woods with 'the lost boys' to gain inspiration for the play. The emotional climaxes at the end are geared to tug at the heart strings, Depp turns in a neat, complex performance, and Dustin Hoffman manages a very wry theatre producer with great humor.

0553296981|5.0|\\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\" has been with me for nearly 10-years. I first read this book at the age of ten, again at thirteen, and I've just read it again. My first review, written nearly three-years-ago, was written in haste, as I just wanted to add reviews to my About You Area. I first read it at the age of ten for school, after a teacher noticed my immense interest in the Holocaust (which lasted for nearly six-years straight). When I read it, I was amazed by this girl who seemed so much older than myself (at the time, a thirteen/fourteen/fifteen-year-old seemed greatly older) - a girl who lived the most effervescent years of her life in near solitary, only to be killed after yearning so much from herself and life. I read it again three years later, at the age of thirteen - the age Anne Frank started her diary. It was then that I felt a true connection with her, as we shared the same views about our parents, school, writing, and life. I felt one with her, and my fascination with the Holocaust deepened, sending me on a whirlwind of research and learning more about the Jewish religion. I kept this book on my bookshelf for years, and when it was chosen as a selection in the book club I am apart of, I was overwhelmed with excitement, wondering what I would take away with it, years after my last two readings. I was able to see the girlish immaturity of Anne Frank, which had seemed so mature when I had last read it, and I saw the immense emotional distraught she was experiencing, and how adults say everything is a \\"phase\\"; whether an outburst is or not, they should be dealt with seriously. I was also able to appreciate her fantastic writing skills and thought provoking deliberations. People say that this book does not portray the horrors of the Holocaust. This diary does, in the most haunting way. We can read inside the emotional thoughts of a young girl, when she herself was hidden away from the world - a girl who did not truly understand what the world was like for Jews, and what her fate would turn out to be, as she was hidden away in what was thought of as a safe refuge. People think that if a book does not deal directly with a gas chamber or a concentration camp, then it is not about the Holocaust. How wrong they are! This is not a book, but a girl's life written down in ink on pages, and it boggles my mind how people can be utterly disrespectable and say it's \\"boring\\" and \\"just a teen girl's musings.\\" I implore you to take a closer look, and see if you could so eloquently put your thoughts and fears about things we do in our lives everyday (learn, use the lavatory, cook and eat), only minus the enormous, impending fear that life could end with one knock on your door (a fear I hope we never have to experience). I recommend this gut-wrenching diary.like for Jews, and what her fate would turn out to be, as she was hidden away in what was thought of as a safe refuge.

0060930349|1.0|Boy, am I glad I finally picked up this one. This has been fifth Johnson's book I read; without this one, I would probably go on reading and have to un-learn even more. <br />Johnson's writes in the grand tradition of British tabloid journalism: looking for sensation and scandal, with an abundance of often patronizing opinions and utter disregard for objectivity. As long as you do not know what he writes about, it is entertaining and enjoyable. As soon as you enter the subjects you are familiar with, you will either smile (if you like his bias) or open your eyes wide with horror. <br />So do yourself a favor, read about 10 pages from the last chapter and you will immediately know if this book is for you. <br />As for me, I am finished with Johnson!
B00005O438|5.0|I have seen this film quite a few times and have come to the conclusion that it is one of my favourtie horror films. It is gritty, raw and claustraphobic. A far more primal, gutteral Panic Room. All of the acting is convincing, especially Wallace Stone and the child. I also have never seen a child actor look quite as scared as this one does; to the extent that it makes me uncomfortable, its almost expolitative... i really feel that child was convinced that dog was going to eat him. It is slow building, which is such a releif after a decade of post Scream imitations that insist in shocking me into numbness within the first five minutes. The score is also well suited and Jan De Bont's cinematography is excellent; as what could have come across as fake and or cheesy, actually comes off as utterly convincing and really, really, really scary. Another thing that works well, is the use of colour. The yellows and browns that fill the movie make me feel like i'm there- sweating away inside that car and when the attacks are happening, i feel like the dirty quality of the image is the feel of Cujo's fur brushing against my skin. Scary.  <br />Essentially, it's a simple story- but a really good one. And unlike many Stephen King adaptations which deviate from the novel, the major changes are justified when you look at the film as it is. Had they wanted to make the film an extra half an hour longer, then perhaps Tad could have died... that's the only way it could have been done, in keeping with the pace of what preceeded. A wise, intelligent move. I wish there were more horror films like this. It really feels to me, like the Texas Chainsaw of monster flicks.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|One of my pasttimes is to read the movie reviews on Amazon.  Well I felt semi-inspired to write a brief one about _Collateral_, the film I just experienced. <br /> <br />I thought Cruise was fun to watch, whether his acting was good or not.  I thought Foxx was lousy to watch and his acting was lousy.  I thought Smith could have been replaced by any of a thousand actresses who looked decent crawling on their hands and knees.  I didn't seem to find any chemistry between Foxx and Cruise; they were directing their lines at a camera, not at each other. <br /> <br />As for the plot, it was very fun to watch and very engaging until Foxx called Smith from the top of the building and, surprise!, his stolen cellphone battery dies.  From then on it was lousy cliche chase stuff which suddenly rendered Cruise ineffective. <br /> <br />Bye for now!

B000002KKC|4.0|After reading about half the reviews here, I thought I'd offer up my own contrarian views about this excellent offering by a band whose varied lineups and musical styles over the years have run quite a gamut.    Yes, I do love this album.  It's not my absolute Mac favorite (\\"Rumours\\", \\"Future Games\\", and \\"Heroes...\\" would finish higher on my Mac Favorites list).  What I really appreciate, though, about Tusk is the sense of adventure and the willingness to take a few risks that embodies much of the work.  The fact that some of that work doesn't exactly, well...work, is overshadowed by the many parts that do, as well as by the overarching effort and mood of Tusk.  Taken piece by piece, some of the songs are less than satisfying.  Taken as a whole, Tusk is a delight.    The songs I enjoy the most on their own merits are:    Over & Over--I love the beautifully laconic guitar work here, the lush backing vocals and Chris' matchingly warm, lazy vocal.    The Ledge--Manic, angry and raw, but still tuneful and...I don't know, it has a fun, playful sense about it. The nasty fuzz guitar, the whispered \\"make it baby\\"s at the end of each verse,  the juxtaposed \\"Someone oughtta, someone oughtta, tellyouwhatta, tellyouwhatta, whatit's really alla, really alla...\\" I love this song!    Think About Me--A great hook, great group vocals and Lindsey's hard-edged treatment make this one a nice, fun rocker.  Good group effort.    What Makes You Think You're the One--Another good hook song; Lindsey's voice seems to tremble, quaver and bubble with rage.    Angel--(here's where I get contrarian...) I'm sorry...I really am. I'm just not really keen on most of the Stevie Nicks material on Tusk.  But I do love this song!  Reading the reviews, I get the impression that Angel would be ranked by most reviewers at the bottom of Nicks' Tusk offerings.  Probably just my taste, but I like that Angel rocks a little, meanders less and has a little more of a pop sensibility.  These are all qualities I think serve the song well.    That's Enough For Me--I just like the manic energy; the fuzz guitars and the \\"Yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah!\\"s.     I Know I'm Not Wrong--I love how Lindsey uses a variety of guitars and other instrumentation (what is that, a harmonica thrown into the break?) The song has a nice pace to it and a good hook throughout.    Walk a Thin Line--This song has a languid pace and warm, full harmonies and backing vocals, while chilling lyrics, Lindsey's razor vocals and Mick's rat-a-tat drumming provide a jarring counterpoint.    Tusk--Contrary to the tone of this post, I actually have nothing new to add here.  I think others have already said all that needs to be said about this song (and probably a little more).    Overall, Tusk is a very nice effort, and a very unique entry in the multi-layered, multi-genre Fleetwood Mac body of work.
0312330529|5.0|900+ pages and I was hooked the whole way through.  Particularly interesting and poignant because the story is based on the author's own experiences.  While the writing itself is not consistently good (some descriptive passages rather akin to what I would expect of a high school student who is trying too hard) there are page corners I've folded over to mark passages that struck a powerful chord with me; this book contained very beautiful commentary and reflection on human life and struggle both simple and extreme. Parts of the story were so exciting that I couldn't turn the pages quickly enough.  The simple raw human voice that comes through this book is captivating.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie desserved to be nominated for best picture. I mean who can't like it. It had a boutiful story. The music was unbelievable. How didn't Learn to be lonely win in the academy awards. Phantom desserved to win all 3 of the awards it was up for in the academy awards. This movie is about an opera singer Christine Daee. She hears a voice every day when she is praying for her father. She thinks it is the ghost of her father, but what she doesn't know is that this voice is an actual man. this actual man is the opera ghost. The phantom takes Christine down to his Lair. He wants her to marry him. The movie gets even scarier, when you find out the history of the phantom. If you want to see a great movie then I reccomend you to see the phantom of the opera. You'll be walking out of the movie singing music of the night.

It is such a joke, not on 50 Cent's part but on the people who actually listen and buy this junk.  50 cent's songs basically consists of idiotic \\"rapping\\" and a 3 second tune that is repeated throughout the song.  Where's the talent in that? <br /> <br />People always brag how \\"rap is so talented, and i can relate to the lyrics\\"- Thats a lie.

B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses should go down as one of rock's greatest bands. Ever. Their music was loud, furious, and beautiful at the same time. It was virtual art. At a time when pop music was dominated by the synthesizer and artists like The Bangles, GNR brought the electric guitar's sound crashing back onto the charts with \\"Appetite For Destruction.\\" And today, 18 years later, it sounds just as good as it did then. <br />The albums kicks off with \\"Welcome To The Jungle,\\" with Axl Roses's screeching vocals and Slash's roaring guitar. Slash was superb and deserves comparison to Jimmy Page. All the tracks are perfect in every way; the highlights are \\"Paradise City,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" and the sublime \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" which gave GNR its first Number One hit. <br />\\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is a classic in every way. It's flawless. Guns N' Roses were mean, nasty, loud--and yet they rocked just as hard as Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones. Definitely buy this album.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If any fan of DT does not like this album then they must not be fans of Heavy Metal or Hard Rock. This album rocks. The lyrics are outstanding,the music is hard, and musicianship is fanastic. This is what Progressive Metal is suppose to be about. Hopefully their next album is just like this.
B000003TA4|2.0|And I never will. I will never understand why Nirvana was so popular. Granted, I was fairly young when \\"Nevermind\\" was released in 1991, but even today when I listened to it, I just didn't get it. <br />I did enjoy \\"Lithium.\\" I'll give them that one. But the rest of the album is, quite simply, lifeless. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is one of the mediocrities that dominated rock radio in the early 90's.  <br />You hardcore Nirvana fans need to understand something: Kurt Cobain was not a good guitarist. He was average at best. His riffs were one-dimensional and practically put me to sleep. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing horrible about his music. It's just . . . average. I wouldn't have given this album such a bad review if it weren't for its massive popularity. Nirvana did absolutely nothing for rock music except make Guns N' Roses seem uncool. Which is a shame because Guns N' Roses were far superior. <br />I am sorry to say it, but \\"Nevermind\\" is not a classic. People may remember it, but it hasn't aged well. It's sad, really. Cobain sealed his legendary status by dying young. While it was a tragedy what happened to him, he wasn't anything special. One reviewer compared him to Jim Morrison. I laugh.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Definitely the best album of the 90s.  Superb ambient, progressive rock.  Great multi-layered texture, but not overproduced.  Thoughtful, intelligent lyrics.  Takes a few listens to get into, but once you're hooked you just can't stop listening to it, and discovering hidden nuances.<br /><br />Brilliant.
006054094X|2.0|yeah, the publishers have it pretty much in a nutshell, the book takes a potentially interesting subject and turns it into an analysis of species dispersion across continents, don't buy this book, just pick it up in a shop, read the first chapter and the bit about the calculation of longditude and you will have got all you can out of this book, (except if you are interested in the precise proofs, in which case turn to the proof section at the back.)
0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is Steinbeck's Pulizter Prize-winning novel about an Oklahoma family, the Joads, who goes on a journey to California to look for work after their farm was taken away by the banks and the landowners. But they find out a lot more than what they thought about the promised land called California when they finally get there. they get treated with disrespect by the people who live there, calling them and many other outsiders from Oklahoma 'Okies' and being pushed around by the deputies. They started out as a big family, then lost members throughout the novel. the book also has some 'interchapters' by the author to show us what happened during the depression.<br /><br />To me, Steinbeck's novel was both good and boring.<br /><br />Good, because it was a good story, with perfect detail and well-crafted characters. It was also structured really well, with the dialect the author used for the characters to make them realistic. I think Steinbeck did a great job with this work, different from Of Mice and Men and The Pearl.<br /><br />This novel was also boring because of the interchapters. one, they have nothing to do with the actual story. And two, they have paragraphs that just puts me to sleep. I know they're there just to show us what's going on during the story, but still, it just loses my interest.<br /><br />Overall, The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinback at his finest. I was, honestly, glad to read it myself. And I think everyone else, especially high school students, should read it as well.

B0002YCVXI|2.0|Ennio Morricone has time after time proven himself as one of the greatest composers of all time, inside or outside the realm of film. And Yo-Yo Ma is undoubtedly an accomplished cellist. But their styles just don't blend. <br /> <br />Yo-Yo Ma puts something of a 'classical sheen' on the music, and effectively it brings out the worst in Morricone. Of course his compositions and arrangements have always been meticulous, but they also had a quirky, ramshackle quality that is lacking on this recording. <br /> <br />I'd say try John Zorn's 'The Big Gundown' for a more interesting and adventurous take on Morricone, or Triology 'Plays Ennio Morricone' for a string trio interpretation, similar in theory to Yo-Yo Ma's but with so much more life. <br /> <br />Or better still, go for the Morricone originals - 'A Fistful Of Film Music' is a great start.

Although the romance between Cry-Baby and Allison was a little predictable, it makes for an awesome movie.

On the slightly negative side, while the book was a highly enjoying and amusing read, I did think the Americanized version of the story done in Cusack's movie by the same name was much funnier.  Jack Black's performance made the Barry character that much more memorable as did the guy who played Dick.  Not enough stars for this book but 5 is a really good start.

0590259385|5.0|I have read this book to my son frequently, ever since he was about 9 or 10 months old.  The book has a rhyme and rhythm to it, and my son even from a young age picked up on it and can anticipate each \\"part\\" of the story.  I think that this is very helpful to get the young ones to begin to enjoy books.  The words are used in a repetitive manner and I think it will help him learn them better, and he likes the illustrations of the animals.  Even though he is still quite young, I know this is a book that he will cherish as he begins to read on his own.
B000002B7U|4.0|this is a great album by ozzy.  I don't know why he would hate it so much, every song is great.  Although the songs are great ozzy's vocals aren't.  He sounds like he does today when he talks(maybe he is trying to hard to sing).  Still the album is great i would give it a 4 1/2 out of 5 if i could.
B00005B3Z6|4.0|Sometimes it makes a difference which version of a show you see first. <br /> <br />I was actually suprised when I saw the U.K. version. Usually, I ALWAYS like the European version of a production much better than the American remake. But not in this case. Maybe it's partly because I saw the U.S. version first, which is more glitzy and glamourous, but the UK version actually bored me. I didn't like the dialogue as much (had nothing to do with the Manchester accents)for one. For another, I kept comparing the Stuart character to the Brian character. Aiden Gillen (as Stuart) can't hold a candle to Gale Harold (as Brian) in the sexiness department. Also, I had a hard time believing that Stuart(that slight somewhat girly guy) was this huge Canal Street Stud! And, I'm used to the strong dance/pop/rock/trance musical backdrop of the U.S. version, instead of that folksy guitar score in the U.K. version. <br /> <br />Since I saw the more dramatic, faster paced, glitzier U.S. version first, the U.K. version seemed boring. If I had seen the grittier, slower paced, artsy-er, more realistic U.K. version first, then I would probably think that the U.S. version was too over-the-top. And I might also think that Brian was too tall! <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the U.K. version is a fine show.
B00006RCSR|1.0|Watch this when....you need to rent a video for a drippy teen-aged girl. <br /> <br />Drew Barrymore, in a not particularly attractive mode, plays Cinderella as a regular gal-next-door in medieval England.  Well, MAYBE.  Actually, it's set in France, but they all wander around with terrible fake Brit accents.  There's no explanation for this.  There is also:  No wit, no sparkle, no songs. AND the story has been messed with.  Not only is there no magic, but her fairy godmother is....  Leonardo Da Vinci??? (And even HE is not interesting -- how sad is THAT??)  There is some attempt at portraying Cinderella as a feminist.  The \\"portrayal\\" is an embarrassment to feminists everywhere, just as Barrymore is an embarrassment to actors.  Drew's acting is rote - she appears to be reciting for a high-school audition. Okay, frankly, her acting is awful, awful, awful.  For the life of me, I don't know why this did so well in the theaters.  Must have been the teen-aged girls.  It is watchable, but with a lot of eye-rolling.  Or perhaps a stiff shot of vodka, since the only way this film could be called palatable is if you had a few under your belt. <br />  <br />In English (FAKE English!), released in 1998 (if only they had released us from having to experience this film).  Principal Cast (weep for them):  Drew Barrymore (actress in training, and an awful one at that), Angelica Huston (perhaps she thought there were no more good roles for older women?), Dougray Scott (even three first names won't confuse the Actors Guild enough to prevent your receiving credit for this film, Dougray - nice try, though), Patrick Godfrey, Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey, Timothy West (go west, young man, escape this film), Judy Parfitt (her agent should have fits for casting her in this waste of filmstock), Jeroen Krabbe (and who can blame him), Lee Ingleby, Kate Lansbury (bury this on your resume, honey, and take comfort in the fact that it will be forgotten soon enough), Matyelok Gibbs, Walter Sparrow, Jeanne Moreau (o how the mighty have fallen), Anna Maguire, and a host of other individuals whom I will spare association with this so-called \\"film.\\" <br />  <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|The 1st thing 2 get clear is that \\"The Massacre\\" is not \\"Get Rich\\" but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Secondly this is the best thing to come out of the shady/aftermath/g-unit camp since 50's debut album. It is far superior to Banks' & Bucks' solo efforts, Eminem's dismal latest lp or even the Game's \\"Documentary\\". While u won't find the same radio friendly hits, such as \\"How We Do\\" or \\"Higher\\" that fill The Documentary from start to finish, on 50's latest album, this is one of the best things about The Massacre - IT IS NOT A COMMERCIAL ALBUM. In fact the only radio friendly tracks besides \\"Disco Inferno\\" & \\"Candy Shop\\" are \\"Outta Control\\" & \\"So Amazing\\". While many 50 fans may not agree, i think this is a good (& surprising) thing for The Massacre. While The Documentary may seem like a great album, it is a collection of similar sounding songs that quickly get boring. The Massacre on the other hand has a diverse range of songs, with many of the producers used being relatively unknown. This gives the album a fresh sound - we havent heard it all b4. Songs such as \\"Ski Mask Way\\", \\"Ryder Music\\" & \\"Just A Lil Bit\\" see 50 taking his sound in a new direction & it really works. Other stand out tracks include \\"Gunz Come Out\\", \\"God Gave Me Style\\", \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" & \\"In My Hood\\" & considering all the hype \\"Piggy Bank\\" doesn't dissapoint. However, The Massacre is not perfect - \\"Gatman & Robbin\\", \\"My Toy Soldier\\" & \\"I Don't Need 'Em\\" are not great. Furthermore the \\"Hate It Or Love It (Remix)\\" is nowhere near as good as the original, Banks & Yayo just sound out of place. In conclusion im not a massive 50 fan but The Massacre is a good album. It may not as good as Get Rich but truthfully that was 2b expected.
0613180771|1.0|It's so amazing that many reviewers of this book accept everything they read in the book as truth.  Then, when you realize the so many of the reviewers are also of Chinese origin or descendants, it's no surprise.  The history in general sometimes will not reveal a full true story of any events for a long time; 10, 30, 50, 100 years or even centuries.  Recently, there was a finding that, out of the Soviet Communist Archived documents, the Soviet had issued an order to Mao Zedong to instigate the Japanese army to invade and break out a war against China in order to rear-guard the soviet which was at war against German and was worried about another front in Asia against Japan. This is quite contrary to the general notion that Japan invaded China out of territorial aggression.  Those reviewers of this book whose one of the favourite comments is 'Well documented' or 'Well researched' really makes me wonder what they mean by those comments or how they figured whether or not the author has, indeed, conducted good fact findings and researches.  When it comes to the history books, one must counter balance by reading the both sides of its story in question if there are more than one party involved in the event.<br />In this particular book, all the photos used didn't carry any credits of the photographers or publishers.  Neither were they in the original photos (cropped, doctored or otherwise.) As one can do one's own research thanks to the Internet, they turned out to be all bogus photos.  Were they intended by the author, or just mistakes?  This reviewer thinks they are out of the author's malicious intention because one does not make tens or even hundreds of mistakes in a single book by accident.  What compelled the author to use doctored photos and the ones from dubious sources? That leads this reviewer to the suspicion of so to call the historical atrocity.  The fact I haven't seen any corroborating hard evidences of this subject anywhere is also suggestive.<br /> Our common sense also must be used of how 200,000 to 500,000 people, depending on which massacre claimants you subscribe to, were killed and disposed; yet the city maintained or even increased its pre-war population of 200,000 to 250,000 in several weeks after the battle.  Were the refugee naïve enough to be lured into the dangerous city?  Did they find the mass graves as they did in Yugoslavia? How does this claimed death toll compare to the well-documented Jew's death toll in Europe?  Despite the fact that German was well organized and took the systematic approach of the military precision, it took them to perish 5-6 million Jews in the almost ten year long &quot;project&quot;.  This tells this reviewer it's not that easy to dispose 200,000 - 500,000 body in few weeks, let alone killing that many people.  Maybe most people in the North America are not aware of that China has a long history and their history also extends to the Propaganda wars and plots.  In fact, China has been engaging in the propaganda war against Japan since early 1970's as the Chinese Communist document admits.  Is it a mere coincidence that the Chinese Communist didn't start claiming the event until almost last part of the 20th century? Ironically, subliminal brain washing is a choice of the wars by many countries in the information age.  So obscure are the agents of the propaganda war such as the author of this book regardless of whether she assumed it intentionally or otherwise.  Unlike those good old days, book readers today should not be naive minded if their favourite is a history book.  Otherwise, they'd better stick with books of the fairy tales.

0440238609|1.0|As an avid reader, a Christian, AND a Harry Potter fan, I was deeply insulted by these books. I can deal with fantasy worlds, and I am, in fact, a  great fan of fantasy works.  I can deal with fantasy works that have different gods than mine, but Mr. Pullman does no more with these books than to use them as a vehicle to attack Christianity.  I suppose I should not be surprised since people have been attacking Christianity for two thousand years. He promotes all the old lies, such as our goodness and works are better than Grace, and that if we just muster up enough goodness and work hard enough, then we can establish heaven on earth.  I read these since I am a teacher always looking for books that I think my junior high students will like.  They have also won several awards, so I was thinking that they might be interesting.  I was so wrong. These books were a not-so-subtle attempt at brainwashing.  If Mr. Pullman could have left off his attacks on Christianity and all religions in general, they would have been fun, exciting adventure stories.  His attacks, however, went too far, and I have advised our librarian to remove them from the shelves.  There is too much really decent literature of all types out there that is not insulting or offensive to submit kids to the rantings contained in this trilogy.

If you don't like it, you don't like it, but don't go ripping it apart maliciously as some people have been doing, go rip on a nickleback alblum or something.  I liked this alblum even before I read a review. <br />Oh, and by the way, David Byrne and alos Bowie are huge fans of this group.  Obviously a band must be doing SOMETHING right to be getting aclaim from these rock gods.  This is music that will stand the tests of time and for the idiots who rip this apart well they can rip it as much as they like.  They're missing out.
0316172324|2.0|This book seems to have been written only because of the success of the Tipping Point, not because of a worthwhile subject matter.  It jumps from facts, to anectodes, without a strong enough argument.  After reading the first one, I was very disappointed.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Sometimes a movie is so bad that it is actually fun to watch . . like THE BLOB or INDEPENDENCE DAY . . . but this one has nothing to save it.  Full of clichs, including a Cheney-like VP, global warming presented as absolutely the origin of the disaster, the good guys surviving . . . something resembling credibility was needed and was missing.  Even the \\"special effects\\" were not special.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|It's Daft Punk allright, but it's not the fun happy Daft Punk that you know and remember. There is a definite anger and melancholy aimed at current pop culture in this album that makes it not that fun to listen to. Daft Punk was fun once but now the album is simple, guitar/vocoder driven crap. There are a few songs that are worth listening to again but for the most part when you hear it once you get the jist of it.  <br /> <br />I love Daft Punk and I am sorry to have to write this. I know that they are constantly trying to expand and create something new, which is awesome, but they found a bunch of craptacular things to express this time around. Too much simplicity, not a lot of divirsity, and way too much repitiveness (even for Daft Punk). But they are Human After All.
1594200106|5.0|In a scene from this richly layered novel the character Nuria Munfort listens to the illusive writer Julian Carax recount what she calls \\"magic tales.\\" The same could be said of the story-telling skills of Carlos Ruiz Zafon. He is almost always one step ahead of the reader-- at least this one-- in this combination coming-of-age tale, tragic love story, dark murder mystery, historial novel, travelogue on Barcelona and commentary on antiquarian bookstores. While it is difficult to say much about the plot without giving it away, I promise you that you were never be bored and that you'll read the last 100 or so pages straight through. Mr. Zafon ties everything together nicely. Occasionally he-- and/or his translator-- turns a memorable phrase; parts of the narrative are reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. A funeral wreath being sent to a wedding is something that the master, himself, could have written. There are jabs at the Americans and their obsession with television--one character labels TV the Antichrist-- and thoughful comments about life: we remain alive, for example, as long as someone remembers us.<br /><br />The young narrator Daniel, as if peeling off the layers of an onion, gets deeper and deeper into this tale of murder and deception as he sets out to find out all he can about the mysterious author of THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and other novels ( Julian Carax) that keep getting stolen from bookstores and burned.<br /><br />The critics are right in their high praise of this novel.
1559408855|5.0|Among the great cult films is Pier Paolo Pasolini's \\"Salo,\\" it remains popular because it is so daring and depraved and because it's a hard film to find. You can call \\"Salo\\" depraved, disgusting, stomach-churning and horrendous, it is all this and maybe more, but so is the worst of what the human imagination can offer. The film is based on \\"The 120 Days Of Sodom,\\" the final magnum opus by the notorious Marquis De Sade. It is both an adaptation of Sade's book and ideas but also a very clear critique of fascism. Today in the year 2005 the ideas regarding fascism may seem a little out of date but the statements about human psychology and extremes remain intact. Pasolini, like Sade and another legendary director, Luis Buuel, understands human psychology, the extremes of emotion and impulse. A group of fascist leaders bring a group of young boys and girls to a secluded place and make them practice whatever lustful ideas come to their minds while listening to sexually-charged stories. Eventually it goes furhter and furhter into torture, murder and excess. Someone not familiar with Sade or Pasolini will probably watch this film and simply turn away, disgusted with the images on screen. This is not erotica in the style of \\"Belle De Jour,\\" this is a real look into how far man can go with the impulses and darker reaches of the imagination when left out of control. \\"Salo\\" dares us to confront the things our mind creates that we're too afraid to share, it was Buuel who said that only in the imagination is man free, here man tries to break loose and forget morals or restrictions, indulging in whatever pleasure the mind demands. Feces are eaten, both girls and boys are raped and then some, all because the fascists think it and want to do it, they're in power so who's there to stop it? Even now that the era of fascism in a sense is over, \\"Salo\\" still makes sense because excess and depravity will always be human, universal issues. Consider the Sade book was written centuries before the cinema, these are ideas that have been kicking around for a while. Pasolini directs his movie with a visual sense as well, we get rich halls and colorful walls, an elegant contrast to the horrors taking place. The cinematography is gritty and creates an almost frightening documentary-like reality. If you are not squemish then I recommend seeing \\"Salo\\" (if you can find a copy) for the psychological questions, the human insights and intensity. I would also recommend watching \\"Quills\\" about the Marquis De Sade or read \\"The 120 Days Of Sodom\\" to get a better feel for the material. \\"Salo\\" is bold, daring and risky, three things modern movies are very much afraid to indulge in, for this alone it is also worth seeing.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD was and is still amazing.  I've been listening to it everyday for almost a year now, and none of the songs have grown old! My personal favorites are \\"Tusk\\", \\"Say That You Love Me\\", \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", and \\"Hold Me\\"; although there isn't a song on this collection I won't listen too. I highly recommend it.
0783225849|5.0|The first time I saw this, I was completely sucked in by Marion, and then later what I believed to be Norman's plight. No film ending has ever made my jaw drop like this one. I never saw it coming, and after numerous viewings, it still shocks me--must have something to do with the superb music, peaking right at that point. Excellent. You won't be disappointed.
B0007OASII|5.0|I cannot over-emphasize how good this album is.  The best advice I could give you is to buy this album and make it part of your collection.  The main vocals by Khan are amazing.  The female and background vocals/harmonies are flawless.  This album was put together very well and is a masterpiece in my opinion.  I look forward to Kamelot promising more music like this in the future.  If you want a quick idea of what this album has to offer, listen to  tracks 1, 3, 6, and 8.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I kid you not; I spent most of my time laughing throughout this 4-hour film. I'm not going to give you a lengthy rendition of all the important facts one usually includes in a review as many have done it before me, so read theirs if you are looking for practical and knowledgeable information. I must inform you that I am an illiterate twit who has never read a Shakespearean play in her life. These comments are purely concentrated on my own personal thoughts as I viewed this film. Right, here we go. <br />Kenneth Branagh plays...Kenneth Branagh, though even more hammy and over the top that before. This might seem annoying to most hardcore fans of the play but for me, well I just lapped it up. This guy is MAD. I have to commend him for the directing as well as it goes like this: Focus on me! Me I say! Right now once you've got my face slowly zoom in closer and closer until you can see the hairs up my nostrils. <br />You get the picture, be prepared to see a lot of Kenneth Branagh. In fact it's almost over exposure! But that's fine with me, as I love watching him hop about with that insane glint in his eyes as he contorts his facial muscles with every line. It's pretty impressive really. There's only one catch. Every time I think of hamlet or indeed any Shakespearean play, his face and voice conjure up in my head. I have also seen him in much ado about nothing (I love that play) and he *is* Benedict. I can't think of any one else. So now, when I read Shakespeare out loud I sound like Kenneth Branagh! The same crazy intonation! The same un-necessary heightening of vocals! It's quite disturbing really. Kate Winslet plays Ophelia and she's definitely got that `I'm a few sandwiches short of a picnic' act down to a tee. But come on! A straight jacket for heaven sakes! I run around screaming, giggling madly, singing out of tune and dry humping the air on the floor in my nightgown every other day! She's perfectly sane. Or should I say it's madness by numbers or perhaps just another over the top scene from this outrageously over the top film. But hey, that's what makes it so enjoyable. To me anyway. Well we finish off with a rather engaging sword fight where the men, clad in, hey!, over the top gear(the torso padding is defined with pecs, abs etc) battle it out. Hamlet, by the powers of Kenneth, is able to launch his sword from one end of the mile long room to the other, where it pierces and kills the king, who's in full sprint, in a perfect bulls eye. Quite a feat if you ask me. Anyhow if you want to buy this movie on dvd, you'll have to wait since it will be released on December 31, 1969 according to Amazon. Er...yeah. Thanks to the reviewer below me who's rightly informed us that it will be available in 2006. Buy it then. I loved it!!! But then again I'm mad, so perhapes I could relate a little more then most.  <br />
B0000DJZA5|3.0|For all the official accounts, and revising the tracklisting over and over again, one can only be led to two conclusions after listening to Let It Be... Naked: first, this is NOT Let It Be 'as nature intended', as the sticker in the CD cover tries to state; and second, this is NOT 'the original Get Back album', as some people wanted to believe. This isn't really anything that we could possibly expect: it is not a comprehensive account of the tremendous quantity of material that came out of the Twickenham/Apple 1969 Beatles sessions, it is not a proper soundtrack for the Let It Be movie (which has been out of print for years by the way), it is not the 1970 Let It Be album with the strings removed... it's really a mix of all that. And the reason is pretty clear: Paul McCartney hated the original Let It Be album, 'reproduced for disc by Phil Spector', didn't like anyone adding instruments to his songs and did anything that was possible to give to the world a statement of that.  <br /> <br />So the discussion among Beatle fans was in order of 'was this *really* needed'? And the answer is quite easy: no. In all accounts, this sounds as an attempt to rewrite history (although an analysis of the release track by track could make one jump to slightly different conclusions) which was simplified by the fact that John Lennon and George Harrison are not around anymore to be strong oponents. We had gotten the point, really... on Anthology 3 we heard stripped-down versions of \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\", the two Paul anthems from this album, plus some excerpts from the conflictive sessions that were so documented. The thing is that, in 1969, there were at least two mixes for what was going to be called the Get Back album, with tracks coming from all the sessions, without any orchestrations and marking the scenery that Paul McCartney wanted for The Beatles around that time (just the four of them, no additional instrumentalists, simple music to be played live). JohnLennon and George Harrison vetoed its release, and called Phil Spector for the improvement, and whilst he worked with those tapes, the project was abandoned and the masterpiece Abbey Road was recorded in mid 1969. No tracks from this mixes can be heard on this Let It Be... Naked release. <br /> <br />What do we get, instead. First, an album with a horrible title. Second, and essentially, we get the selection of tracks that Phil Spector made (go figure!), but without his orchestrations. And this calls for changes, that sometimes are slightly better, and sometimes are major surgeries. Since the dialogue from the original Let It Be album is totally removed (except for George's calls in the solo of \\"For You Blue\\", which, for the record and albeit cleaned up, sounds pretty similar to the Spector version), different versions of \\"Two Of Us\\" and \\"Dig A Pony\\" are offered (i.e. the dialogue is removed, but they are essentialy the same that appeared on the 1970 Spector LP), and even though the mix is clearer and brighter with today's technology, one sort of misses the warmth that those silly dialogs brought to the tracklisting in the original album. The running order is also modified; \\"Get Back\\" now opens the album, and again the version is quite similar to the familiar ones (in this case, the one from the single mix, since the \\"Rossetta\\" dialogue from the beginning is missing), but fades out quickly, leaving one cold and confused. And this is a problem that, sadly, follows in the most reworked tracks of the album, such as the otherwise fantastically remixed \\"One After 909\\". <br /> <br />\\"I've Got A Feeling\\" is perhaps the most surprising addition; a completely different take with fresh sound and more prominent John/Paul interaction, better than the Anthology Vol.3 version, but still an alternate... just like \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", in a take that resembles a rehearsal (a Beatles rehearsal anyway) and captures the intimacy that Paul wanted for this song originally, evenwith some inaccuracies in the execution of the instruments, most clearly heard in the piano and the bass; or \\"Let It Be\\", the epic anthem that comes in without the familiar orchestra (which was also present in the George Martin-produced and Paul McCartney-approved single version of 1969), but instead with a prominent organ which gives a different sound, certainly LESS epic. The two creations here are \\"I Me Mine\\", in which the engineers couldn't just use 'single takes' because the song had overdubs and edits, and they had to leave them in order to have a comple entity (one has to remember that this song wasn't originally intended for the Get Back project); and \\"Across The Universe\\" which was recorded almost one year prior to the Get Back sessions and released in a charity album with 'wildlife' sound effects (that version can be found on Past Masters, Vol.II) and here finds glory in a brilliant mix that brings out the deep poetry of one of Lennon's best compositions. <br /> <br />But even in the succesful remixes, one has to agree in the fact that they are certainly NOT what The Beatles were wanting to do when they recorded this album. Some of the tracks have been reconstructed, some alternate versions have been used, some deep changes have been made (like dropping \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It\\" in favour of a very inferior version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", an otherwise fantastic song) and the very attempt can be criticized. But it could be saved if the offering was better, or an improvement over Spector's mix (or even over Glyn Johns' mixes from 1969). It definitely isn't. It's just a proof of how great The Beatles can sound today with the technology effects available, a reminder of how badly their discography cries for a remastering/remixing/re-releasing process, a sampler of the thousands of songs that were rehearsad and roughly recorded in those 'dark' Twickenham sessions, and finally, a way to remember that the Let It Be period is one of the hardest in The Beatles' musical story and that is very hard to documment, even with today's powerful technological tools. In this context, the \\"Fly On The Wall\\" bonus CD is almost a joke: disjointed music and dialog snippets without point in just one track... bootleggers could agree that there are enough pieces of good music in those sessions to release a proper 2-CD collection documenting them. <br /> <br />Let It Be... Naked exists because Paul McCartney wanted it to. I don't know if it's a commercial move by him, but it surely is an unneeded addition to a catalogue that needs other sort of changes. It still is a nice buy, because it contains Beatles music and that's always a great deal to one's ears. But try not to be fooled by this, nor to have big expectations. Just expect an alternate album from the one you're used to, with good sound but little cohesion. Or if you're a new fan, remember that most parts of this album were created in 2003, thirty-five years after the last sessions for the original album were finished, and, even if the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, start with the 1970 album.
0446677450|3.0|Kiyosaki is right about two things:<br /><br />1. Financial education in America is woefully inadequate. Parents need to educate themselves so that we properly educate our children - the schools just are not doing the job. Our kids graduate college with virtually no knowledge about investing, personal finance or practical economics.<br /><br />2. As consumers we tend to gather liabilites instead of assets; especially income-producing assets. We need to start with personal financial statements and balance sheets and really plan for our financial future; especially retirement.<br /><br />This book couldn't come at a better time. The Social Security system is bankrupt according to its Trustees. Yet, we have a middle class largely underprepared for retirement or taking control of their own financial future.<br /><br />However, Kiyosaki has a most annoying writing style. He dangles I-am-about-to-tell-you-the-big-secret in front of the reader and then delivers small nuggets of common sense that are a lot less than the hype.<br /><br />I disagree with Kiyosaki about the meaning of life- a life spent chasing riches in this world is empty and unsatisfying - merely chasing the wind. He seems to regard the acquisition of wealth as an end in itself. There is meaning to life when understood through the eyes of our creator and Father. God has the ultimate answers to our questions and the promise of a more abundant life.<br /><br />Rich Dad was not a prophet - just a hard-working entrepenuer with more common sense than most. Rich Dad is worthy of respect but not worship.
B00006LLOB|4.0|I had read disappointing reviews but wanted to buy The London Sessions anyway. I love it. the first disc is superb, with great renditions of Killing Floor, Going Down Slow, and I Want To Have A Word With You as bonus tracks. Plus the original part of the album. The second disc could be better but listening to how a great blues master such as Howlin Wolf and his crew interacted with Brits best is amazing. the highlights for me though are the 19 year old harmonica player, Jeffery Carp, Eric Claptons skill as a blues musician, and the legend Howlin Wolf teaching  the blues.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is not your usual David and Goliath sports film about the gritty underdogs who prove that hard work and faith will overcome all odds. Nope.<br /><br />While these kids are taught about hard work and discipline there is so much more. They learn about humility (\\"Don't believe your press clippings\\"), fading glory of high school football, (\\"This is the best moment of your life\\") and the withering, destructive nature of personal ambition and pride (It's all about Boobie\\").<br /><br />As a parent of high school athletes, I found too much that was distrubingly familiar. It gave me pause to remember how I had handled similar situations with my kids - and I didn't like every personal reflection I had.<br /><br />A lot of herd-hitting truth is packed into this excellent film. And a lot of hard-hitting action, too! This is a moving, powerful, and persuasive rendering of a fascinating story of high school sports in America.
B00005JNEW|4.0|This is not your typical football movie, but probably one of the more realistic ones. Okay, except for all the high school players looking like college players (yes, even for great teams in Texas). Many of the events are very realistic, at least for most of us.
630512762X|4.0|This film is a staging opportunity to showcase two actors in a marquis moment: John Travolata and Nicolas Cage.<br /><br />The story line is absurd and the plot is thin but the magic here lies in the byplay of these two outstanding actors. Like melody and countermelody these two rise and fall, intertwine with each other, balance and finally combat one another in a climactic death song.<br /><br />Ego and alterego find their full expression in the plots to kill each other, good and evil wrestle together and the future hangs in the balance as these two titans square off. Cage and Travolta appear to really enjoy playing off one another (and admit as much in later interviews) and it shows. Method acting finds its zenith in these two roles.
0670033375|3.0|When I saw this book at my local bookstore for 30% off, I snatched it up and expected to be drawn into another fascinating historical narrative by Jared Diamond with important things to say about today's world.  This didn't happen to the extent I expected.  <br /> <br />After finishing the book (which, by the way, with its 500+ pages is not a task for the feeble-hearted), I'm fairly certain that Diamond is spending too much time fly fishing in Montana, bird watching in Papua New Guinea and being held up in traffic in LA and not enough time tying up all the loose ends he has left in this novel as well as eliminating about 1/3 of the text without hurting his premise. <br /> <br />A writing style that introduces a subject by telling the reader what you're going to write, then presenting it in great detail followed by a summary that reiterates what has just been written is perfect for a PowerPoint presentation in the corporate boardroom.  However, in Collapse, this is repeated chapter after chapter and the chapters themselves appear to be originally written as separate self-contained essays.  The overall effect is somewhat akin to being bludgeoned to death with the same information and conclusions over and over! <br /> <br />In the first chapter, Diamond informs us that he began the book with the \\"naive\\" expectation that it would just be about environmental damage but eventually resorted to a five-point framework to explain the collapse of societies where an environmental component was involved (p. 11).  The five points are: (1) environmental damage, (2) climate change, (3) hostile neighbors, (4) friendly trade partners, and (5) the society's response to their environmental problems.  Diamond remains faithful to this five-point structure throughout the book, but weakens his case by his choice of examples. Most are very isolated societies shrouded in mystery at the end of a narrow life-line where common sense dictates that long-term survival would be tenuous. <br /> <br/>The \\"mystery\\" involved in many of these collapses gives Diamond the license to expose us to really \\"cool\\" examples of geological detective work involving the study of tree rings, sedimentary cores and (my favorite) rat middens.  This is amazing stuff, but hardly something to create a sense of urgency about the consequences of environmental damage in the present world. <br /> <br />Diamond would have been better served to show examples of why environmental devastation didn't crash some great civilizations in the past as well as giving us more concrete examples of how true \\"civilizations\\" went down the tubes due to destruction of the environment.  His treatise on the Mayan civilization is the closest he gets to this.  In my opinion, this is the weakest link in his otherwise persuasive argument. <br /> <br />In the final chapter, Diamond uses the Dutch word for land reclaimed from the sea, \\"polder\\", to advance his premises that the world is one big polder today, the environmental consequences of anyone region are truly global, and we all need to look after the environment together if we are to prosper.  This seems very reasonable and is nothing new, but is a bit at odds with the premises he has advanced throughout the rest of the book which predicated collapse in situations of isolation or contact with only a limited number of other societies. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Diamond does a nice job of personalizing many of his examples.  The effect on me has been that I've been noticing subtle environmental issues around me.  These include erosion of horse trails at a dude ranch in the Texas hill country when the trail does not follow the contour of the land and residential construction sites in Houston clear-cut before the building begins which eventually results in the previous piney woods being replaced with an urban forest of live oaks and other tree species. <br /> <br />A greater awareness of local environmental impacts might be one of the most positive potential results of reading this book.  Because reading it is such a long and tedious journey, I doubt that too many will persevere to the end.
B0002X314C|4.0|John has come a long way since slum village but then again no one really knew the extent of his talent until now. When I first saw him on slum village and heard he was going solo it was hard to figure out what direction he was going in. Once the first single droped \\"I used to love you\\" then I knew he would take the route of what kanye likes to call gospadelic music. A mix of gospel, hip-hop and funk and soul which works out just fine. What was good here? <br /> <br />Lets get lifted <br />Used to love U <br />Alright - has an iriee hip hop beat <br />Number one - kanye lays a nice rap over this song <br />Ordinary people - the highlight song that shows his true talent <br />Stay with you - has an old school folk like vibe to it <br />Live it up -- nice remake and also have to watch out for the mad violinist aka Miri Ben -Ari <br /> <br /> <br />Overall John legend was able to make his mark with this and I think was able to seperate himself from his identity with slum village. John legend as an artist is more on the Alicia Keys status than just being the singer in a rap group. Anyone looking for good singing mixed with hot beats and melodies should not hesitate to pick this up. <br /> <br />Get Lifted ....and get this!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|First off, a Greatest Hits album is, by definition, a compilation of a band's greatest 'hits'. So, quit complaining about the omission of tracks like Mr Brownstone and Nightrain, because although they are great songs, they were never released as singles! <br /> <br />To the kid who called Guns n Roses 'just another 80s hair metal band with no talent', i'd like to invite you to take your infinitely great taste in music elsewhere in future. Guns n Roses were the Led Zeppelin of thier time (though somehow i doubt you know who Lep Zep are..). <br /> <br />Now, on to the album; i'd call this an adequate collection that showcases the different sides to GnR; sometimes raucous, sometimes sweet; always brilliant. The only weak songs are the final few tracks, where the GnR veteran listener is left wanting more of the earlier sound and not the decidedly average [but still listenable] music from GnR's twilight years. <br /> <br />Overall, a good album. From the rockin' Welcome To The Jungle, to the beautiful November rain, this album provides a decent collection for the first time/casual fan
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|There is more bad music than good music released these days, so to get an album like this is a great thing. Queens of the Stone Age in my opinion have released 4 solid albums, and while I haven't decided whether its as good as Songs for the Deaf it is another great release by the band. Some people say \\"but Nick Oliveri left the band, this album has lost its edge.\\" While it may not be as heavy as Songs for the Deaf, singer Josh Homme keeps it fresh and I wouldnt consider it soft, although less aggressive. Oliveri wasn't the bassist on the self-titled debut (I don't think) and that was a great album as well. Anyways the album as a whole feels dark and I am loving it. Some standout tracks to note would be Medication, Burn the Witch, Someone's in the Wolf, and You've got A Killer Scene. My favorite tracks are Tangled Up In Plaid (\\"I could keep you all to myself, I know you gotta be free, so free yourself\\") and I Never Came, which is probably the most relaxed song on the album. So if you are into good modern rock music from bands that reinvent themselves with every album, pick up Queens of the Stone Age's new album. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B0002TKFR2|4.0|If you already have the Tschaikowsky-Brahms Violin Concertos by Heifetz/Reiner, don't hesitate to buy this item also.  Heifetz is again wonderful, always a little on the fast side.-  In the Beethoven I prefer the Kreisler cadenza in the first movement, and no cadenza at all in the third. The Mendelssohn sounds even better than the Beethoven.- Munch/Boston are excellent partners, and the sound is great
B000002MUQ|5.0|It's hard to believe that a full decade has passed since the release of Van Halen's \\"Balance,\\" one of the more underrated albums' in VH's catalogue. Although there were a lot of great bands popular in 1995--Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine--it was still refreshing to have a kick-ass new Van Halen album out.  Although \\"Balance\\" was released in the days of grunge and alternative rock, it still managed to sell over two million copies.<br /><br />\\"Balance\\" takes up where \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" left off, but the music is overall heavier, and has more of an edge. Gone were the synthesizers and more pop oriented songs that that were prevalent in the first two Van Hagar albums. \\"Balance\\" rocks hard like its predecessor, but it is also somewhat darker.  I take the general theme of the album to be the loss of a relationship, or going through a major life-change, and then getting back in \\"Balance.\\"<br /><br />The band sounds very focused and tight. Bruce Fairbain did a great job of getting the best out of the band and gave the CD a tight, crisp production.  It goes without saying that Eddie's playing is terrific and each song has one or two killer solos. Mike and Al provide a killer rhythm section as usual.<br /><br />The album begins with the hard hitting \\"The Seventh Seal.\\" It starts with an atmospheric Buddhist chant leading into the song.  This is a really cool, heavy dark song with an almost hypnotic riff. \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" is a balled in the vein of \\"Why Can't this be Love,\\" but doesn't have the dated, cheesy keyboards. \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" is about the breakup of a relationship, not the hope of one as it is in \\"Why Can't this be Love.\\" I take the mid-tempo \\"Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)\\" to basically mean that love is not enough to stop a suicide. The album lightens up a bit with the fast-paced \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Big Fat Money,\\" two good, hard rockers. \\"Strung Out\\" is a sound-byte of Ed apparently ripping a piano apart, which leads into the majestic balled \\"Not Enough.\\" \\"Aftershock\\" is an excellent rocker and has one of EVH's best solos on the disc. \\"Doin' Time\\" is a very cool drum solo that leads into the instrumental \\"Baluchitherium.\\"  It's catchy, infectious groove and killer solos make it a favorite of mine. \\"Take Me Back (D&eacute;j&agrave; vu)\\" remains my personal all-time favorite Van Halen song from the Sammy Hagar era. It's a beautiful, bittersweet, semi-acoustic song with the theme of wanting to return back to an earlier time in your life. The album ends with the depressing \\"Feelin'\\" a song that deals with getting though life alive, without getting burned.  It's by far the most morose song VH ever wrote.<br /><br />\\"Balance\\" was Van Hagar at it's best. It was also their last album. About a year and a half after it's release, Sammy Hagar and Van Halen parted ways. In hindsight, by listening to this dark CD, you can almost get the sense that although the band still sounds cohesive, this was destined to be the last Van Hagar CD.tly ripping a piano apart, which leads into the majestic balled \\"Not Enough.\\" \\"Aftershock\\" is an excellent rocker and has one of EVH's best solos on the disc. \\"Doin' Time\\" is a very cool drum solo that leads into the instrumental \\"Baluchitherium.\\"  It's catchy, infectious groove and killer solos make it a favorite of mine. \\"Take Me Back (Dj vu)\\" remains my personal all-time favorite Van Halen song from the Sammy Hagar era.

B00005JNDZ|3.0|I love Ren&eacute;e Zellweger she carried Tom Cruise (in my opinion) in Jerry Maguire. But this movie did not do her justice. The Bridget Jones character was so annoying I could hardly stand to watch her. The fight scene between the two guys towards the end was the funniest part in the movie.<br /><br />I guess this movie was not meant for me....a guy.
B00005ASOI|3.0|O.K., this is probably going to annoy some of the other reviewers of the film, but here goes ... If you watch SUSPIRIA within a historical context, it was definitely ahead of its time and in some ways, a truly ground-breaking horror film.   <br /> <br />Visually, the director Argento was pushing the envelope of horror films like few others in 1977 and the film is a feast for the eyes, with some truly original (if not more than a little bit garish) sets that look like nightmarish paintings come to life and inventive cinematography that can perhaps best be described as Hitchcock on LSD.  The music score is also at times genuinely creepy (although its main motif is repeated so often that it loses some of its novely after a while.)  <br /> <br />There is still much to appreciate about the film and its visual impact does still pack a fearsome punch (some of the unexpected scenes are still disturbing and jolting.)   Here's the problem ... after nearly 30 years, the film has not aged well.  The acting is as overwrought as what you'd see in a Spanish novella and the music, though effective, is actually irritating in many spots, swelling ridiculously in volume everytime something ominous is about to happen (we get it, there's evil around the corner!) Its also shrill, dissonant and downright grating in spots (I wish there was a way to tone it down.)  The film is a great deal of style and very little substance, which is not necessarily a bad thing for a horror film, if it manages to carry you along the plot with its visuals, however ...   <br /> <br />The problem is that its so over the top that it approaches cartoonish at many points and its graphic violence towards women is hard to dismiss today.  Ultimately, I recommend this film to horror fans, who should take it for what it is and consider when it was made, but for everyone else, I think you'll find all the praise that has been heaped upon it over the years to be a bit overrated.
B0000C8AW2|3.0|Dylan goes Vegas! Well, it's an experiment that sort of works, despite the fact that only three or four of these songs are the kind that you'd gladly listen to out of context. The rest feature some seriously misogynistic lyrics and unadventurous music. \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is Dylan jerking off to a deck of tarot cards and delivering a mad howl of a vocal performance (minus a croak during the final verse) atop the steady rhythms of his big band and a gaggle of female backup singers. \\"Senor\\" remains one of the creepiest performances in the Dylan canon, a rare occasion on Street-Legal in which the music complements the lyrics rather than overwhelming them. And although \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" sounds suspiciously like \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (try singing \\"how does it feel?\\" along with the title line, and listen to that organ!), it's a hell of a closer. \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" was a hit in England, and suitably hooky, but the lyric is ho-hum. <br /> <br />The rest of it? Well, there's a reason Street-Legal doesn't show up on those lists of \\"Greatest Bob Dylan Albums Ever!\\" but it has a mysterious charm that separates it from the rest of Dylan's work. For all the bitterness of the lyrics, they're still interesting on paper (an unusual case where one might GAIN something by separating the words from the music), and Dylan works some fantastic lines into even the more boring numbers: \\"Don't keep me knockin' about from Mexico to Tibet,\\" from \\"True Love Tends to Forget,\\" for instance. But the big band too often obscures the lyrics, resulting in a tendency for the differences in the songs to become blurred. <br /> <br />Oddly, I find myself bringing Street-Legal on road trips quite frequently, to the point that I probably play it more often than any other Dylan album. Even if it's not a spectacular record, it can at least serve a utilitarian purpose. <br />
B00008ADPF|1.0|That's funny. I hear several people calling this band grunge. This is grunge? Wow, I thought grunge was GOOD music, bands like Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, The Melvins, Tad, Stone Temple Pilots, Temple of the Dog, Pearl Jam, Green River, etc. Adam McKay is right. No wonder most rap fans hate rock, they think it's nothing but borgng and whiney crap like this band.For good music listen to any of the above mentioned bands, S.O.D., Anthrax, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Aerosmith, etc.
B000002H6C|5.0|BUY IT!!!! This is a great album that plays the whole way through.  As you may have heard, the production kinda sucks.  The guitars don't sound Metallica-ish.  The drums are clicks and you can't really hear the bass(although Jason Newsted played great on his Metallica debut.)  All-in-all, this is probably Metallica's most complex album with some great tunes. LONG LIVE THE FOUR HORSEMEN!!! Favorite Tracks: Blackened, One, Harvester of Sorrow, and Shortest Straw
044024157X|2.0|When I purchased the book, I expected a typical mystery (something I was in the mood for).  That is not what I got.  Instead, I got more of a Saturday afternoon movie.  The actual \\"murder\\" takes up only a 1/5th of the book.  The rest is a sociological study of Mississippi.  If I was in the mood for that, I would have gotten a sociology book.  Why label it a mystery when that is not what this is about?
B00006LLNU|5.0|( ) is one of the few CD's i've heard that dosn't get old. After listening to it for a while, it evolves into something which no other album could be. The tracks are long, but just long enough to allow you to experience them fully, and feel what is meant to be felt. An outstanding record ... but be prepared to devote the time needed to listen to the whole thing.
B00005KHJM|5.0|WOW. This is one powerfully disturbing movie!It REALLY freaked me out since one of my greatest fears (my Room 101) is to be the sacrificial  lamb in a rabid religious mania. This film is truly deserving of it's cult following. And a great cast too: Britt Eckland, Ingrid Pitt and the grossly underused, Diane Cilento (Tom Jones, Hombre, and Hitler: the Last 10 days).
1592400876|5.0|Sheer curiosity lead me to pick up this book.  Curiosity not about punctuation, but about how a book about punctuation could possibly become a bestseller, and more to the point how a stickler could engage the masses!   <br />It is ironic that the author intended this book for serious sticklers as it is those very sticklers who have written the harshest reviews - it can't be helped I suppose, it is their nature.   <br />I think mild to moderate sticklers will get the most out of this book; it is light hearted, it's easy to read, it's clever and extremely funny. Oh, and you can pick up a few pointers and clarifications along the way too. Enjoy!
078322933X|1.0|Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable.  An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy.  Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies.  Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet.  Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father.  And so on... we've all seen this before.  It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though.  Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like \\"Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action.\\" And so he does.  And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature 1hr. 16min.  Woohoo.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like.
B0007P3582|4.0|the album is dabomb it has to grow on you a little but the beats are tight and 50 is the hottest thing in the game right now so stop hatin,its good that he disses jada and nas and fat joe,though I do like nas I think jada is weak, 50 keep killing them clowns!!!!!
0805047905|5.0|My 16 month old daughter loves this book!!  She will want to sit on my lap and read this book over and over again - she doesn't always want it front to back - she sometimes likes to flip around to her favorite animals.  This was a great way to teach her colors, animal names and I use it for animal sounds as well.  Great book.
0440238609|5.0|This is simply great writing, and acheives a level that the Harry Potter books do not. I highly recommend them, and I offer a bit of advice to the Christian zealots who can't stand any book that doesn't follow their narrow little path: get a life.
1400032717|5.0|This book is simple and quick but at the same time really opened up the door to a new world - the mind of an autistic teenager. I enjoyed the non-traditional writing style as it was just one more aspect of understanding the main character.  Along with delving into the trials of this boys life and letting me take a peek at a world that I know little about - it also has an entertaining \\"mystery\\" plot weaving through the entire story.  A very quick read  that I do recommend.
B000002UAU|5.0|OK, so it might not be the \\"best album of all times\\" for many people. But there's no way we're all going to agree on something like that. <br />The album is excellent. If you don't like the Beatles, it's still a great record because it's a pioneer album. No one had made such an explicitly psychedelic concept album. It was crazy and revolutionary. And that's what's great about it. Even today, I am shattered by it. So you may not like the Beatles, or hate Sgt. Pepper's as an album. But it still deserves respect for being what it is. That's something I'll never get about Beatles haters. If you don't like them, that's fine. But they deserve respect for being such great contributors to present-day music.  <br /> <br />To all of those reviewers who said Dion and Britney are better, I would recommend that you set your feet in the ground. These people don't write their songs. If they do, well, I don't think any of them will last as much as the ones in this record. The Beatles' pop sucked? Newsflash. Pop as it exists today is greatly thanks to them. And yes, they were musicians, to whoever said they weren't- they played many instruments, sang and composed. They weren't the best singers or guitarists in the world? That doesn't make them undeserving of being called musicians, because they were. <br />Please don't compare them to the manufactured plastic pop we have the disgrace to listen to today. They were different, and this album is proof of it, along with all their other works. <br /> <br />Conclusion--- it is not overrated. the beatles rocked. i can't say much to change all you people's minds. but i can say that the beatles are worth a listen, and the album is worth buying.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This film has been so abused by the critics I begin to wonder about their motives.  It IS better than the matrix - with a clearer message.  Fight scenes are creative and riveting.  Physical (animal) sensation is treated as the same thing as aesthetics, but who looking at the movie poster thought it was claiming to be deep philosophy.  As far as it goes, its well done - perhaps the warning about \\"hate\\" crime legislation and psychoactive drugs is too close for comfort for the critics.  Many of them just call it \\"goofy\\" and juvenile - or uninventive.  Drama for the masses has to be clear-cut and simple by it's nature.  A film worth watching more than once.  George Orwell might be impressed.
0385510454|5.0|I have read the following works of John Grisham: THE FIRM, THE PELICAN  BRIEF, THE CLIENT, A TIME TO KILL, THE CHAMBER, THE RAINMAKER, THE RUNAWAY JURY, THE PARTNER, THE STREET LAWYER, THE TESTAMENT, THE BRETHREN, A PAINTED HOUSE, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, THE SUMMONS, THE KING OF TORTS, THE LAST JUROR, BLEACHERS and finally THE BROKER.  Most of these books are exceptionally well written enabling the reader to be pulled into the world of the novel.<br /><br />In examining Grisham's work, one finds a \\"redemption\\" theme in most of them. On an NPR radio interview, Grisham discusses his joy of writing about  redemption and how his wife has been encouraging him to find an alternative theme.  In my untrained literary eye, I feel that his novels that lack this theme are visually limited.  That is, these novels lack the capacity to induce rich pictures in my mind.  In addition, redemption, in and of itself, does not necessarily mean that the main character is going to triumph or be enriched. THE PARTNER and THE KING OF TORTS are excellent examples.  Thus, the history of how Grisham handles redemption does not mean that the central sympathetic character is going to emerge prevailing or even surviving.<br /><br />While reading toward the end, those who are most familiar with Grisham's plot style will be acutely aware that there will be a variety of alternative endings to this novel.  I suspect that readers new to Grisham's style will be able to accurately predict the outcome.  Regardless of one's experience with Grisham, virtually all readers will find themselves sitting on the edge of their chairs as Joel Backman evades his diverse pursuers.<br /><br />There are two personal key points about the locations within THE BROKER. First, my family's origin is Northern Italy.  THE BROKER is the only piece of fiction that notes this geographic area.  In addition, the novel includes one of my favorite towns in the world -- Culpeper, Virginia.  How can I not like a book that includes these locations?cludes these locations? <br />
B00004XPPB|5.0|This movie is exceptional. Nothing, absolutely nothing and no one falters in this film except for the acadamy for not recognizing it. Mike Newell did a marvelous job and the actors are superb. I've always admired Pacino as an actor and his choices but here in this film he is a true artist. This performance proves that Pacino's talents are truly a gift and are limitless. And Johnny Depp what a terrific surprise. I knew he was talented with the roles he's played but he's finally a grown up here and showing such grown up abilites. I loved watching him and Pacino together. Their chemistry is amazing. Like I said this movie is a masterpiece. Its real, its deep and its special.    This movie should have given Pacino his second oscar and Johnny Depp his first. Cause its a winner!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Just like every other reviewer, we all agree that Savage Garden is just...amazing. Their music truly does comes from heaven. Every piece on here is just...astounding and brilliant...absolutely heart warming. Sincerely, God bless Australia :D <br /> <br />
B00005JL0I|5.0|\\"The one & only, original, James Bond.\\"  I've been waiting since I first seen this on Cable for the DVD and it didn't disappoint.  I was already a 5-star fan before, but what makes this dvd great are the special features.  For one I learned that Peter Sellers got fired for not showing up for one take that included scores of extras.  I think he said he was ill.  Also, Orson Welles didn't like him & was loathed to work with him.  Despite this, it's interesting that Sellers is credited as the star of the show.  They also show the t.v. version which makes the feature seem as a work of high art. <br /> <br />Last, but not least, if one wonders about all those hot femmes as bit players, we're told that the studio was made in the London's Playboy Club.  When one considers the bond catalog, its highs & lows, Casino Royale has to be near, if not the, top!
B0007NFL18|1.0|I used to be a huge fan of 50 especially with his other albums such<br /><br />as power of a dollar or get rich, but this is a joke.  How tha hell are u gonna rap about jarule in his previous tracks he is a wanksta when u come out with the same songs. Anyway about the piggy bank I<br /><br />think 50 went a bit too far trashing jada and fat joe, but anyway they got him back real good especially jada just check out his freestyle diss chackmate.
B0000025ZF|4.0|Roger's ability to invoke emotions within the listener was probably at its maximum with this album. The tracks segue into one another seamlessly but for a break in the middle where you used to flip the vinyl, and i must say it's like taking an emotional journey listening to this album. The story seems to be about the main character Roger picking up a pair of hitch hikers at the beginning, the main character is going through some type of experience through his dreams, his wife and the hitch hikers he picks up and what we are listening to are the inner thoughts going through his mind, his dreams etc. It is almost like Roger took his subconscious and directly translated it to paper, it really is a very well written, imaginative and emotion invoking and somewhat abstract piece of work lyrically and it deserves to be put under more detailed analysis. More than any other album I seem to be picturing the visuals in my head to go along with the music, and the guitar work from Eric Clapton really helps this in setting the mood playing the same type of role David Gilmour played in that other band Roger used to be a member of. This album is different. It is almost an impenetrable fortress, it sat on my shelf for weeks before I actually had the courage to play it and give it my attention. Not much music requires you to put this much effort in but it is very rewarding.
0425163407|5.0|Loved the book!! This Scarpetta is unique in it's subject and style.  Fans beware - you won't be able to put it down!
B00067189O|4.0|Yes, you may well have bought 'Kind of Blue' before (on vinyl, CD, remastered CD with bonus track etc etc etc) but this new dualdisc edition is well worth buying. <br /> <br />Due to the fact that Dualdisc is more compatible with the majority of DVD players and home theatre setups than either SACD or DVD Audip, my feeling is that this Dualdisc will take off. <br /> <br />The album is of course a work of genius, but one minor negative point: as this is meant to be a full 5.1 mix, I found the rear left speaker was left with too little to do compared to the rest of the speakers on this mix: it provides ambience, but unlike the rest of the speakers, never got a share of the multichannell panning in the way a good 5.1 mix should (witness the drum rolls and keyboard splits on the DVD-A of 'La Woman' by The Doors). Nevertheless, buy it - just the sort of record that has the right kind of spaces in it for superb 5.1 listening pleasure.
B000000YG5|5.0|This appropriately titled classic hard bop session from the summer of 1956, was not no ordinary hard bop session. This was a masterpiece by one of the most brilliant minded saxophonists in jazz.  <br /> <br />The genius had  recorded his seminal classic album, Tenor Madness, which is over-shadowed by this one, within the same couple of months, and Sonny was at the top of his game; until he quit for a time four years later.  <br /> <br />This album begins with one of the most famous and memorable jazz melodies ever. The song which later became Sonny's theme song, St. Thomas, which has been covered by many jazz artists such as Chuck Mangione and Mundell Lowe.  <br /> <br />The song is a brilliant composition and conversation between Sonny and drummer Max Roach. The song is begun in a latin rhythm set by Roach, in which Sonny does the melody and solos some of the most beautiful stuff my ears ever heard. Max Roach then takes then next solo still in the latin feel, then he sets the next groove by turning his snare on and begins to swing his solo until the whole rhythm section comes in for Sonny to express more of himself. Tommy Flanagan gets the next solo until Sonny goes back to the melody, (still swinging) for one verse, until Max sets the group back in the latin feel first demonstrated in the early minutes of the piece. This song is a classic.  <br /> <br />The only ballad here, You Don't Know What Love Is, is taken beautifully here. Strode Rode, an up-tempo piece swings heavily. The last bars of Flanagan's solo leading up to Sonny and Max's interchaning solos is haunting. Once the two do exchange solos, it is brilliant to listen to. Roach's never ending ideas with Sonny's unique play of the notes make Strode Rode a very enjoyable listen.  <br /> <br />The tune with the more popular title of Mack The Knife, (usually done by singer Bobby Darin) is in a more jazz setting here. And the masterpiece ends with Sonny's extraudinary composition, Blue seven. One highlight is Doug Watkins' bass line. Other highlights include Max's numerous drum solos.  <br /> <br />This album opened the door for many young players. It also gave Sonny the recognition he needed to be one of the most influential saxophonists in jazz. This is the first period of the genious of Sonny Rollins.  <br /> <br />Saxophone Colossus, a fine and brilliant musical journey from start to finish, that gets better with every proceeding listen.
B0007N1AI6|1.0|judas priest has always been a favorite of mine and ive loved all their music, but this just makes my ears bleed perfusively while stiking my head with a bloody mallet. this album is a abomination to judas priests legacy.     what does lochness mean?!?!?!?cmon now, cant they come up with a better name of a song?i can, how about Garbage. or A fragment of Trash Laying Parallel to a Pile of Logs would be good.two good names for one horible cd.     the worst songs on ths album are all of them. there is no \\"best \\"song on this one.    i would not recomend this to hardcore fans of the priest.if you like great bands gone soft,then you might like this.     good riddance to all
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|It's been interesting to read the reviews from folks around the U.S., and around the world.  I found the movie to be extremely emotionally moving.  Beautifully shot.  Robbins, Penn and Linney put in outstanding performances.  Bacon, Harden and Fishburn are solid as well.  The Oscar nominations and wins were well deserved.  Yes, the ending is not happy.  But how often in life are we able to wrap things up to our liking with a big bow on top?  Not everyone has a struggle-free childhood that leads them down a successful, enlightened path in life.  This movie is about those that don't, and the fall out that can follow them all the way to the grave. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a movie where the characters find redemption in the end, this is not the movie for you.  But if you're looking for a moody, emotionally haunting murder mystery, this is a sure bet. <br /> <br />Having said all this, I think I think I \\"got\\" this movie more than some of the reviewers for two reasons (and why I discounted my 5 star view down to 4 stars): <br />1) I read the book before I saw the movie. <br />2) I lived in the Boston neighborhood where the story is set (and Dennis Lehane grew up). <br /> <br />As is typical with book vs. movie, a book has several hundred pages to tell a story whereas a movie has 2 hours to tell the same tale.  There are subplots in books that just don't get the same treatment in movies.  The subplot of Bacon's character Sean and his estranged wife is an example.  I would've preferred the entire subplot left out of the movie as there just wasn't time to explain it.  Linney's and Harden's family is developed much deeper in the book and goes a LONG way in explaining how they ended up the women they are today.  In the book Linney's character, Annabeth, makes her husband Jimmy (Penn) practically look like a saint.  Also, I noticed several reviewers referring to the ending as \\"Eastwood's ending.\\"  This isn't Eastwood's ending, but Lehane's...all the way down to the Dot Day parade. <br /> <br />And speaking of Dot Day...as one reviewer put it, the gritty Boston neighborhood where the story is set operates by its own code of conduct.  Lehane does a decent job of explaining Dorchester.  But how do you cram hundreds of years of turmultuous history into a subplot of a book, much less a 2 hour movie.  To answer one reviewer, Dorchester explains why Jimmy is a murderer who looks like a priest with an ornate cross tattooed on his back.  When you ask someone raised in Dorchester where in Dorchester they were raised, you're more likely to get a parish name than a geographical name.  You're from St. Mark's or St. Pat's, not from Field's Corner or Adam's Village.  It doesn't matter what went down on Saturday night, you better show your face at church on Sunday morning.  It's this same juxtaposition of values that I believe explains Sean's reaction to Jimmy's actions (something a lot of reviewers had issue with).  Sean, the cop, knows what Jimmy did is wrong.  But Sean, the kid from the neighborhood, knows that locking Jimmy up will only add to the layers of tragedy that have fallen on all of them.  What good would it do?  After losing a mother and a sister, Jimmy's girls would've lost him too, leaving Annabeth to take care of her two step-daughters.  And Davey was already emotionally adrift and DID commit a horrible crime which would've doomed him, regardless.  His wife, Celeste, would've ended up raising their son alone.  And frankly, when Davey got in that car 30 years previous, it doomed a piece of Davey, Sean, Jimmy, Annabeth, Celeste, Katie, the Savages, the Harris's, and everyone else whose lives this story touched.
B0002IU988|5.0|Enough of the Creed comparissons... Yes, this band has 3/4 of the original lineup, but adding Myles Kennedy on vocals was brilliant. Playing the music they want and having fun doing it really shows through. This cd is great from start to finish. I like that Alter Bridge doesn't have the same sound as most rock bands today. And yes, the guitar solo is back - thank goodness!!! Favorite songs include: Metalingus, Shed My Skin, & Find The Real.
B000009RC2|5.0|Its strange (to me at least) how much people rave about Jimi Hendrix when you consider what John McLaughlin was doing with the instrument at the same time. And anyone who thinks Yngwie Malmsteen was the first shredder needs to hear this album from 1971 - McLaughlin beat him to the punch and managed to do it with taste and diversity (which is more than can be said about the Pork Viking). Frank Zappa's Hot Rats may have been the album that initially sparked my interest in jazz and fusion and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew may have been the album to solidify it but nonetheless, The Inner Mounting Flame remains an important part of my personal development as a music fan.<br /><br />Don't be under the impression that this band are all about chops (though all five members are incredibly accomplished musicians). They use to their technical ability to wondorful effect with furious, fiery improvisation and an intesity that matched the early heavy metal of the time. Not that Inner Mounting Flame is simply a rock album played by jazz musicians - there are moments of beauty and calm among the madness that could almost match the smoothest, most subtle jazz.<br /><br />If you're a rock fan looking to get into jazz, or even vice versa, or you're simply a fusion fan who somehow missed this the first time round then you need this album. Hell, I'd recommend it to ANYONE looking for great instrumental music.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|As a lover of the the great myths from childhood and particularly fascinated by Homer's Iliad, with it's intricacy of plots between gods and men, I am committed to contempt of this movie. Itis such a sad travesty of the great epic that I could weep.Apart from a thousand errors  - or deliberate distortions - the casting,  apart from the amazing Peter O'Toole as Priam, and Eric Bana as Hector, is pathetic. Brad Pitt is about as Achillian as a cheerleader (and not even vaguely cute!) and the sets and costumes are pure nonsense. The famous duel between Hector and Achilles is so incredibly botched that one either closes one's eyes with disgust, or leaves the theatre ( unfortunately a sense of masochism kept me paralysed in my seat). What happened to the glorious Hecuba and cursed Cassandra, as well as the twelve sons of Priam? Does one dare suggest Mr Pitt is so terrified of a hint of homosexuality that Homer's lover of Achilles is transformed into a rather plain cousin protected by this non-hero? Did anyone notice that from where Priam and his court sat on the walls of Troy they could never have witnessed the Hector-Achilles' duel?? I cannot believe the reviews have been reasonably kind to this garbage. In a previous notice of HBO's Helen of Troy I was pretty abrasive, but suddely it seems like a masterpiece made at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately a fabulous opportunity has been turned into mince and when Hollywood gets the courage up to once again have a stab at this saga I will be passed on to the Fields of Asphodel. Oh well, back to the book! <br />                <br />
6305736650|5.0|This classic and much-loved romantic melodrama is always found on top-ten lists of film lovers the world over, is a masterful tale of two men vying for the same woman's love in a chaotic love triangle. The story of political and romantic espionage is set against the backdrop of the wartime conflict between democracy and totalitarianism.<br /><br />With a rich and smoky atmosphere, anti-Nazi propaganda, Max Steiner's superb musical score, suspense, unforgettable characters and memorable lines of dialogue (e.g., \\"Here's lookin' at you, kid,\\" and the inaccurately-quoted \\"Play it again, Sam\\"), it is one of the most popular, magical (and flawless) films of all time - focused on the themes of lost love, honor and duty, self-sacrifice and romance within a chaotic world. Woody Allen's Play It Again, Sam (1972) paid reverential homage to the film, as have the lesser films Cabo Blanco (1981) and Barb Wire (1996), and the animated Bugs Bunny short Carrotblanca (1995).
B00005JNQQ|4.0|Great movie. Some crude humor that might be a little obnoxious if your kids start to repeat it, but other than that it's really funny and cute.<br /><br />I love the message of the movie. Not only does it give the basic \\"don't give up\\" motto, but it shows that you can do better than the rich people that look down on you, or the cool people that look down on you, it almost has a hint of anti-racism in it. That the robots made of a certain model weren't good enough for the robots in a different model. Speaks to people of all ages, really.<br /><br />Robin Williams isn't annoying, either, I don't know why people say that. They must just think he's annoying altogether and if that's true, then they shouldn't complain about the movie just becaue they don't like one actor.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This movie is beautiful. It made me cry and its my husbands favorite movie...! Buy it!
B000007OY0|4.0|I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.  It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.<br /><br />Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.
B000003AEB|5.0|'Doggystyle' might as well be the greatest gangsta rap album in history. The beats laced entirely by Dr. Dre and Snoop's rap/drawl make this a killer combination. 'Bathtub' the first track shows snoop relaxing until his homies come to party at his house showing his lifestyle (hectic and and busy), while 'G-Funk Intro' shows a fast paced beat and bassline with The Lady Of Rage taking the song. Then it goes straight to 'Gin & Juice' a raw party song with an amazing bassline and high synthesizer and Snoop delivers a really laid back, smooth rap. Then it goes onto 'Tha Shiznit' - a funky smooth laid back beat, with classic Snoop flowing fantastically throughout the whole song. After that it cuts to Lodi Dodi' - the MOST laid back song on the album where Snoop remakes Slick Ricks 'La Di Da Di' with Snoops flavor. Then it goes onto 'Murder Was The Case' - a hard hitting, raw gangsta classic with a hard beat and synths and Snoop rapping about him invisioning death. Then it flows onto 'Serial Killa' with RBX, D.O.C. and Tha Doggpound which is a fast paced track with a great beat and another high synth track. Then it goes onto 'Who Am I (What's My Name?)' - a upbeat track where Snoop just goes with the beat and flows brilliant. Then comes 'For All My Niggaz & Bitches' where Snoop is non-existant, its just Tha Dogg Pound and The Lady Of Rage, but its still a great song with a piano laced song with gangsta lyrics. Then it goes onto 'Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)' - a chilled out, laid back song where Snoop, Nate Dogg, Kurupt and Warren G flow brilliantly. The comes 'Doggy Dogg World' which is a fantastic track with an amazing bassline and beat where Snoop and Tha Dogg Pound flow so cool here. Next is 'Gz And Hustlaz' - a piano laced track with a cool beat and gangsta lyrics from Snoop and finally 'Pump Pump' ends the album with a fast beat and the best bassline on the album where Snoop delivers the most gangsta rap on the album with Lil Malik a.k.a Lil Hershey Loc who delivers another great verse equal to Snoops. <br /> <br />Overall this is a tremendous, groundbreaking album that defines 90's gangsta rap...
055357342X|5.0|It's hard, when you're reviewing something that's already been reviewed by hundreds of others, to come up with something original to say. Such, for me,  is the case with A STORM OF SWORDS. Faced with this dilemma, I'm simply going to weigh in with all the others who've written in high praise of Martin's work. This is great stuff, and I'm not usually given to hyperbole. The characters are real. They have good days and bad days, they make mistakes, they aren't unrelentingly good or totally evil (perhaps one of two exceptions on the disagreeable side, but even these can give you a sympathetic moment somewhere along the way), they're all interesting, and they're ALL at risk. The plot twists and turns, and is full of surprises. You can never get too comfortable. Moreover, while the battle continues for the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, Princess Daenerys grows stronger across the sea and there's a sense that the ultimate fate of all lurks beyond the northern wall. It's all top-notch storytelling.<br /><br />Does Martin's work have some shortcomings? Sure. His prose doesn't have the elegance of Tolkien's, and he lacks Tolkien's occasional touch of whimsy or humor. These books are deadly serious and quite bloody. They're also earthy, and if you're likely to be put off by this quality, then these books may not be for you.<br /><br />As you probably know, A STORM OF SWORDS is the third book in Martin's A SONG OF FIRE AND ICE series. Yeah, the series title's a little melodramatic (they often are), but so far the books have been great. They're not meant to stand alone, though. A STORM OF SWORDS is much like its predecessors. If you've already read them, then this is more of the same. If you liked the others, this one definitely won't let you down. If you didn't like them, what are you doing here? If you haven't read the others, don't start here. Start with A CLASH OF KINGS. They're all five-star books, in my opinion, and I recommend them highly.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Yeah, I'm simply giving this album five more stars to try and bring up the rating average a bit. C'mon you emo posers! You know this is better than ATDI and almost the rest of prog history put together. Get over it. This is new, this is the now. Thank God ATDI and prog are pretty much dead.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|I just finished watching Napolean Dynamite. I had high hopes for this movie. I had heard that it was being compared to Welcome to the dollhouse which is one of my most favorite movies. ND is not that good of a movie. I kept waiting for something funny to happen. There were some funny moments, but it left me wanting more. I didn't understand why some of the movie appeared to be in the 80's and some in the late 90s. There was no real plot. The movie is worth a watch on cable,  but don't pay for this movie. I probably wouldn't watch it again.
B00064MW6K|5.0|I watch this movie more than enough times than a person could imagine. Each time I saw it, it was entertaining and I still don't understand what the critics and haters are talking about. First, of all Halle had a little bit to work with. Catwoman in the past really don't have that much background information. All these dumbass haters should realize that even in the comic book catwoman kept changing her style, but not persona. They pick the right person to do this movie. There's so much controversy about her suit now. I think it could have been a whole lot worse. [...] And if you look closely at the scratches on her outfit she is wearing stockings. Its not like the skin on her ass is bearing itself. Halle I really see how cruel this world could be. You did an excellent job. And I know in Catwoman 2 you will go all out to get your respect. I wish you the best of luck. The reason people are hating because most of them are predjudice. This movie has great fighting scence, the sensuality is good including the sexiness, and the storyline is definitely not that bad. It makes sense. And I know noone can't resist how pretty that 3-d cat was. It's not a bad movie. What don't ya'll get? They got to be blind! Catwoman is not good or evil she's right in between. I hate how people compare this to spiderman 2. Catwoman is not a superhero! This movie represents confidence in the best way possible.
B000001ELL|3.0|There's no need to analyze this album.  It's hardly stellar when compared with previous ones.  These guys had all but broken up, and the quality of the songs show that.  \\"Sure Know Something\\", \\"Hard Times\\", and \\"Charisma\\" are the only decent tracks here.  I don't give a sh@# about \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\".  As an ex-KISS fanatic, I think that they're desire to keep the money rolling in and 'stay current' were reasons why they 'sank' to this level.  Ace Frehley and Peter Criss are average musicians, and in Peter's case, a below average songwriter.  Ace's guitar playing was perfect for KISS, but wouldn't cut it in Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, to name just a few.  This album marked KISS' (inadvertent) admission that their best songs/albums were behind them.  The last 25 or so years have been about making money on those albums previous to Dynasty.  Sorry, I guess some analysis was needed.
B00005JN4O|5.0|I know very little about the actual circumstances about J. M. Barrie's composition of PETER PAN and so won't join the debate here about how accurate this film is. After all, it states at the opening that it was \\"inspired\\" by actual events, and that gives the filmmakers a very wide degree of latitude. And although there are those inside the film's narrative who want to turn Barrie's frienship with a widowed mother and her four young boys into something scandalous, those in control of the making of the film refuse to allow their characters to do so. The film ends up being not about romance, though there is clearly an affection between the characters portrayed by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, but about true friendship, about the sheer caring about one another because of our shared humanity.<br /><br />The story is simple: famed Edwardian playwright J. M. Barrie, coming off a flop, meets and befriends a widow and her four children, and the imaginative games he plays with the boys becomes the basis for his eternal classic PETER PAN, the title character taking his name from the most resistant and most damaged of the four boys. In truth not a great deal more happens in the film (though what does is weighty and significant), but nonetheless the film has an air of richness and fullness. To the very end, what is most striking is the true and disinterested nature of the affection all feel for one another.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are both outstanding in the lead roles, but the cast is strong from top to bottom. There is some irony that Dustin Hoffman plays the theatre impresario Charles Frohman given the fact that he played the character of Captain Hook in the oddish version of the story that starred Robin Williams. I will add a slightly polemical note and state that Depp belongs to that small but select group of people not named Jamie Foxx who did not deserve a nomination for Best Actor more than did Paul Giamatti for SIDEWAYS, an outrage that stands out as the greatest absurdity in all of the years that I have followed the Oscars. Depp is very, very fine, and had Giamatti gotten his incredibly well deserved nomination, I would not have minded in the least Depp getting one as well. But the truth is that this year Jamie Foxx deserves to win, Paul Giamatti was next most deserving of a nomination, and the final three spots should have been fought for by the four who gathered the four other spots. Rant over.<br /><br />This film could, as many have noted, signal the end of a remarkable era. This is the final film released by Miramax under the leadership of the Weinstein's, who are leaving the company after an astonishing run that has produced some of the most sucessful and respected films of the last fifteen years, providing a series of stylish films often set in the past one hundred years. Let's hope that the future holds as many wonderful things for all concerned.as the greatest absurdity in all of the years that I have followed the Oscars.

1400034779|3.0|This book is about an African women deciding to open a detective agency because she thought she could help people.  The characters are engaging, but the \\"mysteries\\" she solves are not so engaging.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed reading about Botswana and everyday life.  I thought that was the best part of the book. The characters, especially Precious, are entertaining, but I felt the author could have made them more complex. The book is fairly humorous, but not laugh out loud funny. More dialogue probably would have been a pleasant addition. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book if you are looking for a mystery. I would hesitantly recommend this book if you're interested in learning more about everyday life in Botswana.  I found the book to0 simple.
0060925000|3.0|This well-written story is extremely accurate when it portrays events and cultural clashes in India, but it leaves something to be desired when it describes emotions and thoughts of the characters.  Even Lata, the main character, seems like a distant friend, and when she makes the decision that is the focus of the novel, we don't really get to know WHY she does it.   <br /> <br />The major flaw of all novels by Indian authors that I have read is that none of them ever end the way the reader wants them to, and this one is no different.  Couple that with no actual reason for her decision, and the book peters out into slightly mundane at the end.   <br /> <br />However, the beginning and middle are excellent and entertaining.  This book is guaranteed to keep your attention and it provides insight into Indian culture (specifically, Bengali and east Indian culture).   <br /> <br />But don't waste your money for what is a rather unsatisfying story at the end...check it out from the library or borrow it.

B000002J2D|4.0|Perhaps Genesis' most  overlooked album.  \\"...And Then There Were Three...\\" has been unfairly stamped as their first pop album, but it really sounds more like \\"Wind and Wuthering Part 2\\".  Check out \\"Down and Out\\", one of the most intense prog tunes Genesis has ever released, with a great Tony Banks synth solo and a ridiculous Phil collins double bass drum groove.  \\"Burning Rope\\" feels a lot like W&W's excellent track \\"One for the Vine\\", and \\"Undertow\\" is one of the band's best post-Gabriel ballads.  Yeah, the album includes their first pop hit \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", but it happens to be a classy song.  Prog or Pop?  I'd have to say the scale tips slightly towards Prog.
B00008PC2O|4.0|Even bad acting cannot slowdown this movies speed. The action scenes are the best i saw in this year in time. James Cameron did absolutely wonderful in his directing (hard to believe this guy directed and wrote Titanic). While the beginning is slow as hell, once the action starts, it is non-stop and leaves you at the edge of your seats. Even though Arnold has more muscles then most bodybuilders, he is probably the worst actor alive, and this acting job is no exception. Either way, it is a great movie and is probably the best action movie of the 90's decade.
1572702036|5.0|Since everyone else already re-wrote the story a million times let me tell you about this copy and David Suchet's performance. It's the best! <br /> <br />Agatha Christie's DEATH On THE NILE is hands down my favorite novel. I shudder to think how many times I have exactly read this book coupled with how many times I have listened to it on tape. <br /> <br />Filled with an array of characters and voiced superbly by David Suchet, this is the set to own. With over a dozen characters and each having a totally different personality the praise goes to David Suchet for giving each a voice that is easily recognizable as their own throughout the set. <br /> <br />He sarcastic and bitter communist Mr. Ferguson, to the passionate Jackie de Belleforte give the whole thing interest. My whole family loves it, and we are always finding ourselves quoting something from it. No matter how many times you listen to this you will never get bored with it. Over the years I have probably learned the thing by heart, but hey it's a good thing. <br /> <br />A must have for anyone who like the Christie novels or is a David Suchet fan. I know you will love it! <br />
B0007CNXUU|5.0|J. M. Barrie has just written a play which has flopped when he meets four charming boys and their mother in a park.  He begins spending a lot of time with the fatherless boys, creating a magical place called Neverland, where their imaginations soar.  Despite the objections of his wife, Barrie spends much of his time with the Davies family, and soon begins to write a play based on the boys.  \\"Peter Pan\\" is unlike anything that has been produced on the stage at the time, and it instantly catches the imaginations of the audience.  Sadly, Barrie's soaring career is paralleled by the declining health of Sylvia Davies and the distress of her boys.  This lovely film blends the facts of Barrie's life with the wonderful whimsy which comes from his imagination.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet are outstanding in their roles and they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast.  This film is highly recommeded!

He brings some James Gang attitude and free styling guitar to the group and the result is definitely a showcase of great rocking music and one of Deep Purple's two best albums. My God why did Tommy have to die instead of performing more with David Coverdale!? This collection of tunes just never gets old. Coverdale took many years to re-match this performance!
B00005JNQQ|3.0|There really wasn't anything in this movie that is going to withstand the test of time as something awe-inspiring, deep, and/or thought provoking.  However, I still found it entertaining to watch with my family with a wonderful display of CG technology along with a lot of laughs. <br /> <br />Positives: <br /> <br />1)  Humor.  Yes, there are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  Any comedy with Robin Williams has to be.  There was some gross-out humor (see negatives) but when they shied away from that, the movie was very funny. <br />2)  CG Animation.  The computer graphics were fantastic!!  This isn't a surprise as it was made by the same people that made Ice Age.  What should leave anybody left with their eyes wide open was when the star of the cartoon (Rodney) was traveling through Robot City in a ball.  It would not surprise me if this was the most time-consuming part of the animation creation. <br />3)  Message.  This is one of my favorite messages in any movie... if you have a dream never give up in fulfilling that dream.  There are also other messages such as caring for people no matter their age, shape, and type. <br /> <br />Negatives: <br /> <br />1)  Gross Out Humor:  While this was funny, I was surprised that they felt they needed to degrade themselves to the level of flatulence and posterior-jokes.  The movie was funny on its own and I felt no reason that they needed to get that desperate.  This movie should have been above all that. <br />2)  Portrayal Of Big Business:  It seems that this movie carries a negative message about big business.  As a child, after watching this movie I would think that big business must be evil and want to control the world.  Everything about business (bit or small) in this movie contradicts what really happens in the business world in order for a company to survive.  This idea that a large business would be threatened enough to want to kill (literally) an upstart mom n' pop just left me appalled. <br />3)  Lacks originality.There was just nothing ground breaking or original about this movie.   <br />4)  Lacked heart.  Often times the difference between a good movie and a great movie is the heart of the movie.  Again, there wasn't anything original and it seemed like the actors all just coasted through the production.  I just didn't see anything that said that a little extra was given into creating this movie. <br /> <br />In the end, I would recommend catching it at least once.  The kids will probably get a big kick out of it and desire to see it a few more times.  But this would be a good movie to either catch on matinee or even wait to rent it after its video release.
038533348X|5.0|When I picked up Cat's Cradle, it had been a while since I had last read a Vonnegut (Slaughterhouse Five) so it was as if I was a new reader.  Cat's Cradle is like no other book I have read.  Very wry, very well crafted.  I was totally absorbed in Jonah and his journey and, of course, the fate of ice nine.  An excellent reflection on our society, while still an entertaining read.  Go on and read it already.
B0000021RL|5.0|This was one of the first albums I ever purchased.  Great album.  A nice mixture of rock and jazz.<br /><br />Of particular interest was the song \\"I've been searching so long\\".  Fabulous song.  Well written.  Well played.<br /><br />I have read some of the previous reviews and those people have too much time on their hands.  They have decided to be too critical of this particular cd.  I wonder why??<br /><br />Is there any album or cd that is absolutely perfect????  NOOOOOO!!!!!  Most cd's have albums that we can live without.  But we buy them anyway because we like what the group is doing.<br /><br />So buy this album already.  It has jazz.  It has rock.  It has easy listening.  And it is not to be missed.  Sit down and pop it into the cd player and have a drink.  Remember when you were growing up and first heard this album.  Then you WILL agree that this is one of Chicago's best albums.
0596009208|5.0|First of all, I have picked up OO from reviewing and updating C++ code before. I had very little formal training on object oriented programming. I was lucky to have lively teachers who had motivated me with real world experiences. Getting that same motivation from a book is always difficult -- this one does it for me. Yes, I was skeptical about all the pictures in the book along with poor reference capability. However after reading halfway thru Head First Java, the explanation of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are fantastic.<br /><br />If you like humor and want to learn Java, but have little experience with object-oriented matter: pick this up. It may not be a good reference for API, but that's what Sun's web document is for.
B000002KDW|4.0|\\"A Nod Is As Good As A Wink...To A Blind Horse\\" is the Faces' third album in just two years, and it is their most consistent record alongside 1973's \\"Ooh La La\\".    Filled with crunchy electric guitars, blooze-n-boogie piano, and deep, bluesy grooves, it boasts the group's only significant hit, the superb, fiery rocker \\"Stay With Me\\". But there are numerous other highlights, including the strutting \\"Miss Judy's Farm\\", a rollicking cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Memphis\\", and the piano-driven hard rock of \\"Too Bad\\"...everything is worth a listen, actually.  \\"A Nod Is As Good As A Wink...\\" rocks like very few other records of the early seventies, and this fine record proves what a great, underrated rock n' roll outfit the Faces were.
B000002LND|3.0|I like Madonna fine, but in the early-80s I was listening to primarily New Wave music, not Madonna's pop. Having no Madonna LPs, just a few ratty tapes, I decided to buy \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" when it appeared. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br />First of all, Madonna had such an extensive catalog (even then) that there wasn't enough room on one CD for all her hits. So the inclusion of two new songs is inexcusable here. \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\" could have been included on the \\"Erotica\\" CD, leaving room on \\"Immaculate Collection\\" for hits like \\"True Blue\\", \\"Who's That Girl\\", and \\"Dress You Up\\", all of which were left off. <br /> <br />Secondly, the horrid chopping that passes for \\"editing\\" on \\"Immaculate Collection\\" is an affront to any music lover. We buy a greatest hits package to get the greatest hits, not 10-years-later tinkering worthy of George Lucas. On this collection, \\"Like A Virgin\\" is missing 90% of the outro (one of the best parts of the song). \\"Into The Groove\\" has been butchered. Other songs are different than their album versions. Madonna also has a penchant for doing this live, which explains why I would never pay for a ticket to her concerts. Have some respect for your own work, and release it the way the fans have come to expect it. <br /> <br />Those are my main problems with \\"The Immaculate Collection\\". Still rates 3 stars for the wealth of material presented, in one convenient disc. But if you are like me, you will also need to purchase \\"Like A Virgin\\" and the soundtrack CD to \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" in order to fill in the gaps.
B000294SFW|5.0|This al-bomb friggin rocks. Don't even bother with the other loser arse reviews. Blah-Blah, this album frigging punches hard and leaves little for distaste. Old bastards bitch, Motorheads know this album was well worth waiting on. The tracks EACH take a punch in your nut-sack. Damn the complainers, they know not what they say. I'd rip the \\"old\\" bastards heads off if I could. I've been listening to Motorhead for 15 years and can say without a doubt this album is worth your salary. <br /> <br />Trust that my blood-lusty friend.
B00008ADPF|4.0|... this album is also great! \\"Because of You\\" has a great beat and \\"Flat On The Floor\\" is a very speedy/fun song. I must say I only like the band for the fun/catchy beat but the lyrics aren't that great. If you like the lyrics more than the beat, I wouldn't get the album. And you have heard of \\"Someday\\", right? Well that is a great song by them on this album too. Great rock band and album!
B000002OX7|5.0|I picked up this album when it came out a while back, and was amazed at the quality of each song on this album. It begins with the radio staple \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" which includes one of the most recognizable synthesizer 'riffs' in rock and roll. Pete Townshend commands the synthesizer throughout the song, and Roger Daltrey's gravelly voice melds perfectly with Keith Moon's drumming, the piano notes, and John Entwistle's bassline. After \\"Baba\\" comes \\"Bargain,\\" another radio hit that has one of the most persisting choruses in any Who song. The short, acoustic guitar laden \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" could easily have been a single, but compared to the rest of this album, is actually one of the weakest songs. The Entwistle-penned song \\"My Wife\\" is fourth in the line-up, and is one of the songs that shows off Daltrey's range, and also has a catchy horn barrage in the middle of the song, making it one of the most unique songs on the album. \\"The Song Is Over\\" should have been a monstrous radio hit, but unfortunately, was not released. It shows a softer side of the Who, in contrast with a great deal of the rest of the album, but the notes of the piano and Moon's driving drumline make it one of the best songs on the album. Following this is \\"Getting In Tune,\\" another soft song, at least in the beginning. The lyrics are memorable, and it is a fun song to sing along to while driving down the road with the windows down. However, \\"Going Mobile\\" is the quintessential road trip song. Daltrey's range is again stellar. One of the most entertaining songs on the album, fast paced and catchy. \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is one of the best ballads I have ever heard. That's all there is to it. The epic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is by far my favorite song on the album. The intro is one of the most classic openings in classic rock, and the Who don't let up for eight and a half minutes. Moon earns his place among the top three drummers of all time with this song. At this point, the original album ended, with nine of the most beautifully constructed rock songs ever recorded. Beyond this point are the bonus tracks, some of which stand up to the rest of the album, some of which don't quite make the cut. \\"Pure and Easy\\" kicks off the bonus tracks with a bang. Worthy of being included on the original album, this song showcases Townshend's songwriting prestige, as well as his skill with a guitar. \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\" comes next, and while it is a good song with a strong vocal performance from Daltrey, and a slashing Townshend guitar salvo, Moon's drumming doesn't make enough of an impact. One of the weaker songs on the album. \\"Naked Eye\\" is an interesting song, above average, but nothing like the original tracks on the album. \\"Water\\" is a live performance with a strong Daltrey vocal performance, but is lacking in the musical department. \\"Too Much Of Anything\\" is a lackluster effort, the worst of the bonus tracks, and should not have been included on this album. \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" features a great harmonica opening, great lyrics, and an almost silly, but entertaining chorus. The unreleased version of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is superior to the original. It is more subdued, and Daltrey tells the story without stumbling over the vocals as in the original (the word \\"vengeance\\" to be precise).  <br /> <br />BEST SONGS: \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" \\"The Song is Over\\" <br /> <br />SONGS TO SKIP: \\"Too Much of Anything\\" <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. Even with the inclusion of somewhat lacking tracks such as \\"Too Much of Anything,\\" this albums deserves five stars for it's impact on the rock world, as well as the sheer quality of each track on the original album, as well as most of the bonus tracks that were included. Highly Recommended!
B0002OERI0|5.0|The title of this review is directed to some of the other comments that I noticed from other customers.    American Idiot is a great album.  Now, my history with Green Day is somewhat sorted, but it goes like this: (I'm sure no one is really interested but, nevertheless) in my high school, the kids who listened to Green Day were always members of the stoner/slacker crowd-a crowd I never managed to associate with, but always secretly wished I could join.  Consequently, I never felt like I could rightfully claim an appreciation for Green Day.  Granted, I remember the final dance at prom was \\"Good Riddance\\" and who didn't listen to all their singles on the radio?  Every disillusioned youth in America, at one point or another, was able to identify with their message--that's almost a fact.      When I started hearing reviews of American Idiot right before it came out in September `04, I was impressed because it was being publicized as one of the most complete and fully realized albums that has been released in decades, but I had some reservations about buying this album, and I waited too long (six months, to be precise) before I was ready to break down and make my purchase.  However, I am excited and pleased to tell anyone and everyone that what Green Day has done with this album is nothing less than remarkable.      American Idiot is the most mature album I've had the privilege of listening to in a long time; I can't believe how they've managed to articulate the attitude of defeated American idealism-\\"the innocent can never last/wake me up when September ends...\\"  Everyone knows what Billie Joe is referring to.  But at the same time, amid the desperate anxiety there is a pervading sense of expectation, even optimism.  (Now, hear me out before you make judgments and stop reading.) This album has provided contemporary music with the message that a period of devastation and sterility leads to a release and a higher realization of humanity.  It is quite fitting that I happened to buy this album on March 27th 2005 (Easter Sunday).    I try hard not to pretend to know more than I know, but I can tell you that I am glad that I bought this album-I feel like I can confidently say that this is a pivotal addition to music history and it's effects will be evident, for me at least, for a very long time.  American Idiot is a big deal and, even if you're not a \\"punk,\\" pay some attention to this album.
B0000039QA|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. came out with a classic album in 1994 entitled \\"Ready To Die\\".  I think that it is the best rap album ever made.  Those are some big shoes to fill and leave it to Biggie to manage to create a classic on his second album as well.  \\"Life After Death\\" is not quite as good as his 1st album and it's not as dark or raw but it's still an excellent CD.  It's basically a sequel to his first album and it picks up right where \\"Ready To Die\\" left off, as do his skills.  After three years, Biggie dropped this epic in 1997.  It's a classic album sprawled over two discs (24 songs) and there isn't really that much filler (if any).  This is a great follow-up to \\"Ready To Die\\". <br /> <br />Disc one  <br />Intro - Good intro that picks up right where \\"Ready To Die\\" left off (literally). <br />  <br />Somebody's Gotta Die - My favorite song. This is Biggie at his storytelling best. He creates a vivid story of revenge and he lays out some amazing lyrics over this haunting beat. \\"Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips. I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />Hypnotize - Great party song. Good beat, good lyrics. \\"Gon' blast, squeeze first, ask questions last. That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass.\\" 9/10 <br /> <br />Kick In The Door - Great song with some really tight lyrics from BIG. He's got some classic rhymes over this great beat by DJ Premier after a pretty funny skit with the Madd Rapper. \\"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing. They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren. One shot, they disappearin.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />#!*@ You Tonight - Pretty nice song with R.Kelly for the ladies. Big's got some nice rhymes and it's got a good beat. 8/10 <br /> <br />Last Day  - Pretty hot song produced by Havoc. It features LOX and they all tear up their verses as does Biggie. \\"You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and realizin, a fist fight would be asinine\\" 9/10   <br /> <br />I Love The Dough - Great song. I think of it asthe sequel to \\"Brooklyn's Finest\\" on \\"Reasonable Doubt\\".  Again, both Biggie and Jay-Z produce some classic lyrics. \\"You ain't fazing the amazing. While your gun's raising, mine is blazing.\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />What's Beef? - Good song over a pretty catchy beat with a lot of strings. Puffy gets annoying but Biggie's got some more great, slow rhymes. \\"My Calico been cocked. This rap Alfred Hitchcock drop top notch, playa hating won't stop.\\" 9/10  <br /> <br />B.I.G. Interlude - Nothing special or notable other than that it's produced by The Notorious B.I.G. He just spells out his name.  <br /> <br />Mo Money Mo Problems - Very catchy beat but it got overplayed. Still, Ma$e provides a nice verse as does Big. Puffy is OK. \\"Me lose my touch? Never that. If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat.\\" 8/10 <br /> <br />N****s Bleed - Another great song in which BIG tells a gripping story. It's got a great, dark beat. By the end of this song, you feel like you're in that hallway. \\"Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds. Everything to gain, embedded in his brain.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />I Got A Story To Tell - Funny story BIG tells about what happens when a guy walks into his house where Biggie's with the guy's girl. Afterwards, BIG tells the story again but not in song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Disc Two  <br /> <br />Notorious Thugs - Good song with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Shows Biggie's range as he speed raps successfully with Bone Thugs. Catchy hook as well. \\"Doesn't it seem odd to you? Big come through with mobs and crews.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />Miss U - Depressing song that Big sings about friends that have died (mainly about his boy \\"O\\"). \\"I'm a thug, but I swear, for three days I cried. I looked in the sky and ask God why. Can't look his baby girls in the eye.\\" 9/10  <br /> <br />Another - Pretty weak song featuring Lil Kim. Probably considered filler. Pretty bad techno sounding beat too. 6/10  <br /> <br />Going Back to Cali - Classic song about Cali. Great beat and some great lines by Big. Funny phone conversation between BIG and Puffy at the beginning. \\"All I got is beef with those that violate me. I shall annihilate thee.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />Ten Crack Commandments - Classic song basically about how to be a successful drug dealer. Clever lyrics and delivery. \\"Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence? Take it from your highness. I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips.\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />Playa Hater - Very funny song with BIG singing about how to rob. It's just funny hearing him sing (or at least try). 9/10 <br />  <br />Nasty Boy - I don't know. I don't think that there's anything really special about this song. The beat's kind of annoying and the song's not a standout by any means. 6/10  <br /> <br />Sky's The Limit - Great inspirational song by Biggie who basically explains his ascent in the world. It's sad hearing him look forward to his future though. \\"Only make moves when your heart's in it and live the phrase 'Sky's The Limit'\\" 9/10  <br /> <br />The World is Filled - Unncessesary song. Too Short and Puffy make guest appearances but they're not memorable. 7/10 <br /> <br />My Downfall - Creepy song with BIG talking about people out to get him. Great beat and lyrics and DMC handles the chorus. \\"Not too many keep a mill in the briefcase. Infrareds help me sleep safe.\\" 10/10  <br /> <br />Long Kiss Goodnight - Another great, dark song at the end of this album. Some really great rhymes in here over this beat by RZA (Wu-Tang Clan). \\"Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater than the average player haters and spectators.\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You) Perfect ending for The King of New York even though it's very creepy listening to it. Classic lyrics and great beat by Puffy. \\"As I leave my competition respirator style. Climb the ladder to success escalator style.\\" 10/10
B00005JNDZ|3.0|While watching the second 'Bridget Jones' film, about 15 minutes in, I realized that the sequel is not going to be the same kind of romantic comedy.  In short, more comedy and less romance.  Not that the film is bad; it's surely amusing to see it, but in a very different way.  Though the actors are as energetic as ever, slapsticks take the place of the original's character-driven story. <br /> <br />When the film starts, we see happy Bridget.  Good for her, but then we remember another Bridget of the original, so miserable in her family's annual Christmas turkey curry buffet.  And then, because of her misery so convincing, we related to her character immediately.  It was a magical touch, which the new film fatally lacks.  Instead, the second film gives us a parody of one classic musical, and a sketch of Bridget's awfully botched TV report among dirty pigs in a dirty pigsty ... oh dear.   <br /> <br />I am not saying the film is not funny (people were laughing in the theatre, I can tell you).  There are many funny moments in this new 'Bridget Jones' film.  I'm just saying that the film has nothing to add to the original's story that ended four years ago.  Why did they have to make this film anyway?   <br /> <br />Actually, if there is a good reason to make this sequel, it's to see again perpetual womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and listen to his devilishly sweet and hilarious talk, which is, he is clearly aware, total nothing.  Hugh Grant has a strange talent of giving irresistible charms to very empty words, which cast a spell on us too.      <br /> <br />Compared  with him, the love story of Mark and Bridget are not very intersting.  The film shows, Mark and Bridget must overcome another misunderstanding, but that's exactly they were doing about four years ago.  The writers couldn't find anything new to write about in this new diary, and the film fails to produce the original's natural and spontaneous feelings between them.  And the idea of \\"Bridget in Thailand\\" and the 'Brokendown Place'-like story is never the right material for the heroine whose delectable personality is most effective when coupled with the British middle-class values, not on the tropical beach.    <br /> <br />The second 'Bridget' is not all slapsticks -- thanks to four screenwriters including Andrew Davies ('Pride and Prejudice') and Richard Curtis ('Love Actually'), and sure, the dialogues become sometimes lively, but just sometimes.  You probably will notice Richard Curtis's touch, when Bridget mistakes 'Iran' for a person's name.  But witty jokes and intelligence are hard to find in this (unwittingly) ironically titled 'The Edge of Reason.' <br /> <br />The film is funny to some extent, but that's because Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and especially Hugh Grant are doing good job.  The unkind camera often captures the chubby face of Bridget and that's done tactlessly, but thanks to Renee Zellweger the scenes remain watchable.  The gifted players keep the film rolling, and as romantic comedy 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' is entertaining, but not as much as the original.
B000065V3H|1.0|Alas another great movie hacked to bits by the King of Pan-n-Scan, Buena Vista Home Video/Disney Home Video, (Alias The Evil Eisner Empire)!  Hopefully with Eisner on the way out, maybe, just maybe the House of Mouse Dynasty will start producing DVD's the way we want them.  Original Aspect Ratio with just a few goodies tossed in for good measure.  The studio still treats all of its movies as if they would air on The Wonderful World of Disney on a 19\\" color portable TV.  Um, I think they canceled that show as they should this DVD.
B0006ZFQN0|5.0|Deutsche Grammophon seemed to have forgotten about its single disc \\"Originals\\" line recently, concentrating instead on reissuing titles via the \\"Original Masters\\" boxed sets and \\"Musik...Sprache der Welt\\" series (see my reviews).  But all that has changed with a recent batch of ten titles, most of which simply are must buys.  One of those essential discs is this one -- the Beethoven Triple Concerto and Brahms Double Concerto conducted by the great Ferenc Fricsay leading his beloved Berlin RSO.  Fricsay is joined on the 1960 performance of the Triple by pianist Geza Anda, cellist Pierre Fournier and violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, and on the 1961 Double again by Schneiderhan this time with cellist Janos Starker.  This pairing appeared on CD previously in the early 1990s (and the Triple has been available on a variety of Beethoven comps), and it is a logical reissue to compete with the Karajan/Szell title in EMI's GROTC series.  And as celebrated as the EMI title is, in many ways I prefer these recordings as the conductor, orchestra and soloists achieve far greater harmony and unison here, particularly in the Triple.  I still have a soft spot in my heart for Oistrakh's accounts with Sargent & Galliera (on an EMI Import Double Forte), but overall this would have to be my first choice recommendation.
0783225733|5.0|I agree with all the praise the other reviewers have given this amazing film.  The fact that they installed accurate models of the Lunar Module Aquarius and Command Module Odyssey into the Zero-G simulation aircraft (the infamous \\"Vomit Comet\\") shows the dedication the actors and crew to making an outstanding movie, considering the physical discomfort they were subjected to and the many retakes that had to be performed due to the maximum limit of 20-odd seconds of weightlessness which added to the difficulty in filming it.  This film is enjoyable, not only to the casual viewer who has little interest in the Apollo moon-landing program, but also those with considerable knowledge find it a pleasure to watch.  Interestingly enough, <br />I find the most emotional moments, for myself are not only the  <br />point when it is clear they have survived re-entry to the atmosphere, but also early in the film when they are suiting up <br />and purging their bloodstream of nitrogen by breathing pure oxygen.  They look like 20-th century knights putting on their armour and heading out to a great adventure! <br />Having said this, I feel the need to point out several flaws or weaknesses in the film that the viewer should be aware of. <br />(1) I think it was silly to show Lovell, Haise and Mattingly having a \\"beer party\\" at home during the first lunar landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in Apollo 11.  Jim Lovell was the back-up commander of the mission and he, along with all the other astronauts in the program were at mission control, not boozing it up at home! <br />(2)  During the launch of the Saturn V moon rocket, an awesome experience difficult to convey on the small screen and with <br />small speakers, we suddenly see the film reverse and the smoke and fire belching out of the engines suddenly get sucked back into the rocket.  Come on! <br />(3) On numerous occassions, doubt is expressed about the competance of the new Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert because he isa rookie.  While it is true that on all the missions prior to Apollo 13, the CMP was an experienced astronaut, flight-crew Chief Deke Slayton would NOT give someone a crucial job like this unless he, and the other crew men had complete confidence in the man. <br />(4) Although Ken Mattingly was disappointed by being bumped from the crew, he was a complete professional and so he would NOT go home and pout by taking the phone off the hook as is shown in the film. <br />(5)  At the end of the film, Tom Hanks states that Fred Haise had been promised to command the Apollo 19 mission as compensation for his losing the moon-walk on Apollo 13 but <br />\\"the mission was cancelled due to budget cuts\\", implying Congress and President Nixon had lost interest in the Apollo program.  Actually, the government did fund the last three mission, but it was NASA itself, who had been shaken by the close call of this mission that cancelled the final three mission, something that I think is to their everlasting shame! <br />(6) This point can be considered a \\"nit-pick\\", but when the crew was going around the Moon they were pointing out  various landmarks such as Frau Mauro and the Tsiolkovsky crater, but the problem is that they are on opposite sides of the moon and can not been seen at the same time....okay maybe I am too critical-who really cares? <br /> <br />In spite of these mild criticism, I can not recommend this film too much.  After you see this one, you should also see Tom Hanks \\"From the Earth the Moon\\" which gives the entire history of the American manned space program, from the intial Mercury flights, through the two-man Gemini program, up through the Moon landing program of Apollo.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|When Ashton Kutcher is the best actor in the cast you know you're in trouble. It just gets worse from there. The script is terrible, it has some of the worst lines since \\"I, Robot\\" Yet, like \\"I, Robot\\" it has some astounding visuals and great amosphere. In the best scenes it looks like they are in a suburban paradise from a bygone era-- think \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" and you'll get the idea. The choice to make the neighborhood seem outwardly idyllic is brilliant. As is the choice to make the institute seem similarly antichronistic. Other than that, there's not much to reccomend it.   I don't put the fact I am physically disabled in my reviews very often, but I do have to say I was a little offended. Before Kutcher becomes disabled one of the situations he was in involved prison where he is nearly forced to orally copulate a man, and may or may not have been anally raped. (The threat was ever-present, but it is unclear if it ever occurred.) Kutcher survives that ordeal, but put him in a wheelchair and it's time to attempt suicide.
B00000F5KH|2.0|Transit station letter-writer-for-hire, Dora (although she writes letters she never sends) is relatively closed off from the world around her but is forced to open up when she is begged to write a letter for a woman to her young son's long lost father. As Dora witnesses this mother get hit by a bus in the next moment, she realizes the young son is basically orphaned for the moment. So she opens up, but not in the feel-good, maternal-instinct-to- spare way American viewers might expect. No, Dora is keen to exploit this find, and tries to sell Josue (the little boy) for a television. Eventually, though, Dora forms a kind of bond with Josue and goes out searching for the boy's father. Unfortunately it seems too easy for Dora, who is obviously hardened to life and all its sensitivities, to break down all these carefully formed barriers. Her emotion somehow does not seem authentic toward the boy. As a result, the performance is nowhere near the triumph most reviewers have claimed, and the film lacks a certain credibility. Sure, the film is watchable and somewhat interesting, but it was overrated.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Another superb performance from Johnny Depp is one of many highlights of Finding Neverland, a film filled with enough sweetness to prevent it from turning sour, something which may have happened were the film not in the hands of director Marc Forster.  Depp plays playwright J. M. Barrie, who after his most recent play bombs, meets widow Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four boys while in the park.  Soon enough, a friendship is forged with Sylvia, and a bond is formed with her sons, including young Peter who may have grown up too quickly.  Even though Barrie's distant wife (Radha Mitchell) and Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie) disapprove, Barrie continues the relationship with the family, inspiring him to write Peter Pan.  The cast does fantastic work with Depp giving one of the finest performances of his career, while Kate Winslet is Kate Winslet: giving the perfect blend of subtlety and believeability to her character.  Finding Neverland is pure magic from beginning to end, powered by it's emotional and whimsical storytelling making it something really special.  Also featuring Dustin Hoffman (Hook himself) as a wry theater owner.  The DVD features are pretty scarce minus a commentary, but the surprisingly hilarious outtake reel is worth the price of admission alone.
B0000640VO|3.0|For many people, Audrey Tautou IS Amelie and therefore cannot ever be or play another role. I am not one of those people. Amelie did not \\"infect\\" or delight me the same way it seemed to infect and delight the masses, although it was certainly a whimsical, imaginative film with enough visual stimuli to entertain and mesmerize a person through several viewings. And yes, Audrey Tautou's performance was what one might call \\"career making\\" (but also served as a kind of \\"brand\\" in that it is hard for people to see her otherwise). At times hilarious, at other times more tender, the story revolves around Amelie, a shy, quiet, nave waitress in Paris who \\"connives\\" behind the scenes, doing small things that mean something much larger to others. Amelie delights in the little details of life and lives on dreams. She conspires to inspire others, returning lost objects to their owners, befriending people who have no friends, \\"punishing\\" those who are mean or unjust, helping others to fall in love. Hers is, perhaps, the invisible hand making game pieces move across a board, and Amelie derives joy from seeing the reactions. However, she knows her own life in incomplete and sets out to find her path and possibly her own love... this is done in an original and \\"cute\\" way. It is not quite \\"overboard\\" (as in saccharine/sickeningly sweet), but it is not... Neil Labute either. In any case, this is a delightful film, lighthearted and beautifully shot, so it is worth watching to see what everyone has been talking about.
B0006J28KU|5.0|10 years after the release of Michael Mann's epic crime tour de force, Heat is still an absolute masterpiece.  Originally a screenplay which sat on the shelf for almost twenty years before being greenlit, Heat is the perfect character driven crime drama.  Mann pits Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as a dueling cop and crook whose lives bear stunning resemblances to themselves.  Vincent (Pacino) becomes obsessed in his case to help escape the reality of his failing marriage, while Neil (De Niro) is a cool, calm, collected and disciplined master thief who, with his skilled team (including Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) are planning a heist which will change everyone involved forever.  This portrait of these people and their failing personal lives sacrificed for their obsessive careers makes Heat the best film to come from Mann, and undoubtadly the best big budget crime drama to come out of the 90's.  The face off between Pacino and De Niro is a film buff's dream, and the climactic LA shootout is possibly one of the best action sequences in cinematic history.  The rest of the cast, which includes Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Kevin Gage, Denis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo, Henry Rollins, Tom Noonan, and Hank Azaria, does brilliant work.  Truly a cinematic masterpiece.  This new 2-disc Special Edition from Warner Bros. contains a great commentary from Mann and a few nice featurettes, but the deleted scenes are hardly worth watching and add nothing to the film.
B0000CABBW|5.0|A young Maori girl Paikea (newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) in New Zealand is reared by her grandparents. Her father (played by the excellent Cliff Curtis) leaves New Zealand after he loses both his wife and Paikea's twin brother in childbirth. Pai's grandfather is the strictly traditional Maori tribal chief whose hopes for the future of their tribe rested with and died with the birth of the baby boy. The grandfather is struggling against modernism, struggling to maintain tradition and to educate a new generation of young Maori men. He is resentful that the baby who was born to be leader of the tribe has been taken away; his own son cannot face the reality and runs away, leaving the resentful grandfather to rear Paikea. The son has not only shirked his family responsibilities and tribal responsibilities, he has left behind his useless daughter. The baby son had been \\"the chosen one\\", the grandfather believes, as the \\"whale rider\\" and uniter of the tribe must be male. Paikea, in stark contrast to her grandfather who barely tolerates her, loves and reveres her grandfather more than anything, but is strongly drawn to the Maori traditions and customs, constantly defying her grandfather's stubborn opposition to her learning or participating in men's Maori customs. When Pai's father returns from Europe, the grandfather sees a glimmer of hope, trying to unite him with a Maori woman- only to have his son Porourangi reveal that he has a pregnant German girlfriend back home. The grandfather is livid, and Paikea is going to leave to go to Germany to live with her father. New Zealand, though, mysteriously beckons her to stay. She continues to defy her grandfather, enlisting her uncle to teach her the warrior ways. Eventually her grandfather shuns her entirely; Pai is heartbroken. His stubbornness not only hurts Pai deeply, it stands in the way of progress, acceptance and the dreams he holds dearest for the future of his people. The storytelling in this film is subtle, beautiful and heartbreaking. The cinematography is grippingly beautiful, and the relationships between people ultimately heal all wounds.

6303402348|5.0|A beautiful movie about the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a simpleminded yet strangely wise gentle man, and his journey through growing up in a small town in Alabama in the 1950's, as a football hero at college and soldier in Vietnam in the 1960's , a table tennis champion, shrimp boat captain, company director , and cross country runner in the 1970's , the movie takes us through these wonderful times , and Gump's  wonderful relations with all who he comes into contact with ,  especially his mother (Sally Fields) , his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curren (Robin Wright) , his army buddy Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and his other army buddy Lt Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).<br /><br />Filled with tragedy and triumph, Gump also meets Elvis Presley, John F Kennedy, George Wallace, John Lennon and Richard Nixon.<br /><br />It is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit-most beautifully done.
630587493X|5.0|This movie will be in my \\"All-time\\" collection.  Contrary to the writting on the  back cover of the VHS/DVD this is not a comedy but rather a sentimental and touching drama with some comedy thrown in.  This movie goes for the heart like E.T. and plays it like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar.  The movie's  central theme is one of humanity from and from one looking in from the outside and valuing what we take for granted.<br /><br />One thing that stood out was the \\"freedom\\" ideal as seen from Andrew's enlightened viewpoint.  He wanted to be able to be able to serve out of free will.  Thinking back on this, I believe that this - in a way - was a testament to Andrew's love for the family and wanting the Family's ultimate love/trust (If you love someone set them free....) Andrew demonstrated that even thought he was free he would exercise his freedom to continue serving and being apart of the family as he was already doing.  In a world were freedom seems to mean that there is no \\"ball and chain\\"  of obligations, Andrew wants to show the family whom he serves that he does so because he wants to, not merely because he was designed, built and programmed to.<br /><br />Another one of the many issues this film deals with is the one of mortality vs immortality.  While he could live forever, see the many wonders that may come, become rich,  and all the \\"goodies\\" that come with this \\"immortality\\" was it worth it especially when it comes to death of ones he had come to care for.  As ones Andrew has come to care about begin to drop off his lament, \\"Will every human being I care about just leave?\\" sharply drives home a stinging realization that along with living forever one would also be tormented with watching loved ones leave over and over.  Then there was Porsha's assertion that she did not want to live forever because she accepted that she was not meant to, this is so much against our \\"fountain of youth\\" desires.  She did not want to live a lie by living forever courtesy of artificial organs, skin etc, it was not natural, it was not the \\"order\\".<br /><br />All in all this movie is as other reviewers say \\"thought-provoking\\".  It is sentimental toward the human condition and state of being, warts and all.<br /><br />Renting this movie \\"won't do\\".  I bought the DVD.  I don't own many movies.gans, skin etc, it was not natural, it was not the \\"order\\".    All in all this movie is as other reviewers say \\"thought-provoking\\".

0375815996|4.0|My six-month-old son loves this book.  It is a wonderful stroller toy because it keeps him occupied for a long time.  The cover is soft and snuggly; plus, the baby bird can be put in different little pockets throughout the book--so my two-year-old daughter loves to \\"read\\" this book to the baby.  <br /> <br />One caveat: because it's so plush we let our son play with it in his crib and he got the string loosely wrapped around his neck.  He's fine, and he still loves the book, but I certainly wouldn't let him play with it unsupervised again.
B0000640SB|4.0|Men In Black was one of the biggest films of the summer in 1997. I remember seeing it at the cinema and laughing my head (substituting for another word) off. It brought in a lot of money at the box-office and continued to make Will Smith a star.    <br />     This film is so wildly inventive and funny that you'll hardly care if it gets to be a tad silly.  Director Barry Sonnelfeld is a talented filmmaker and has crafted a fun, highly <br />entertaining film.  So this may be one of my all-time favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite sci-fi films.   <br />    Will Smith stars as Agent Jay, who is recruited to be a part of a secret intelligence agency which deals with extra-terrestrials.  Tommy Lee Jones is his partner and him and Smith embark on a mission to elimiate a lethal alien.  Sure the plot is silly, but the film is hilarious.  Smith and Jones have <br />amazing chemistry and certainly prove to be a great buddy team.  <br />This film doesn't take itself too seriously which is a good thing, because as I've stated if you take this film too seriously you are certainly not going to enjoy it.   <br />   Men In Black is rated PG-13 for Sci-Violence and Language.  The action is bloodless, but the language is fair.  Overall, a fun film which you'll have a great time with.  The sequel, while not as good as the origianl, is still worth checking out too. Worth owning or at-least seeing.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This is a completely different Van Halen, the songs are longer. They're darker and the song writing, singing, guitar playing. All of it is terrific. Right below 5150, this is the 2nd best Hagar album and here the tracks:  The Seventh Seal:Kind of different VH song. Great vocals by Hagar.  Can't Stop Lovin' You:Terrific song, great lyrics. It's one of the best songs on the album.  Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do): I know this may sound stupid but this song is beautiful. It's got a great message.  Amsterdam: Very cheesy lyrics, but is a good song overall.  Big Fat Money:Another song with overly cheesy lyrics. This song is OK.  Strung Out: Eddie making horror movie sound effects with his guitar. Very cool.  Not Enough: Really slow, cool song. Terrific.  Aftershock: Pretty good song.Great music.  Doin' Time: Eddie & Alex showing off, but I don't see anything wrong with that.  Baluchitherium: This is an instrumental track that proves VH doesn't need a singer to stay around.  Take Me Back: Slower song. Not terrfic.  Feelin: Terrific song. Guitar playing is amazing.   A.    Who do you like more? Roth or Hagar? E-mail me at moviefreak144@hotmail.com
B00000K19E|4.0|The Matrix, a film which stunned the world when it was released back in late March of 1999 is still a great film which  is certainly one of my favorite films of all time.  I remember how dazzled I was after viewing this film at the cinema, mainly due to the superb visual effects and well I didn't exactly get the plot that well, but I also was only like 10 years old.        I purchased it on DVD in March of 2001 and it has since been a treasure to behold and I'm very proud that it is a part of my DVD collection.           The tale begins with a man named Neo (Keanu Reeves) who is contacted by an individual named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and is told that he is \\"the One.\\"  He is supposedly the savior of mankind, because the Agents (one of which is played excellently by Hugo Weaving) are trying to elimiate of the city Zion, which is the last human city.  The story is much more intricate than that, and may need a few viewings to fully grasp.   Overall, this is a visually stunning film and really revolutionized the way action would be done in the future, but I still don't think I would call it the best action movie ever made.  The majority of the action is infact in the last 30 minutes of the movie, and this is a 136 minute film.  But the action is definetly amazing to see, the \\"bullet-time\\" effect is very unique and original and is surely been one of the most copied off visual effects in recent memory, (ie, Charlie's Angels), though that was still an entertaining movie.        The Wachowski Brothers stunned the world with \\"The Matrix,\\" and soon made two sequels which were delayed due to the unfortunate losses of Aaliyah and Gloria Foster.  \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" were released in 2003 and made quite a bit of money at the box-office.  I actually appreciated the sequels and enjoyed them, and I feel they are just as much worth owning as the first film itself.  Many people  placed too much hype on the sequels and so that's why they've received a mixed critical reaction.  I loved them and thought that visually they were even more spectacular.         Overall, \\"The Matrix\\" is a one of a kind picture, with a thought-provoking storyline and script, nice performances (even from Reeves, who isn't as bad an actor as many think he is).  Carrie-Anne Moss proved to be a great female action star.   The Matrix is rated R for Sci-fi Violence and Brief Language and  I felt that this film could've easily earned a \\"PG-13\\" rating.  The film features a lot of gunplay (some of which is bloodless),  martial arts fights (which are still pretty cool, though there have been films with better fight sequences than the \\"The  Matrix\\", ie: the sequels) and some mild profanity, none of which is particularly strong.         If you've been living under a rock for the last 6 years and haven't seen this film, definetly see it because it's well worth checking out.
B00005JNTV|5.0|It just might be. Sin City's visual flair is what sets it apart from other action films. It is dark and gritty, and it should be, definitely because it based on the graphic novel of the same name. Sin City also boasts a superb cast, and with Frank Miller at the helm, this new film should be the epitome of excitement!
B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator was released back in May of 2000 and quickly became a box-office smash and was certainly one of the biggest films of the summer.  I remember how thrilled I was while viewing it at the cinema.  It soon earned a lot of oscar nominations and took home 5 Academy Awards including Best Picutre and Best Actor, unfortunately Director Ridley Scott did not take home an oscar because he lost to Steven Soderbergh for \\"Traffic.\\"  <br />      Russell Crowe stars as the general Maximus in this exciting epic.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers a superb performance as the evil emperor Commodus.  Connie Nielson, Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris all deliver fine performances too in supporting roles.  This film is a grand epic, featuring wonderful and exciting fight sequences, beautiful sets and locations and of course great direction.   <br />Many comparisons have made to \\"Braveheart,\\" and well they don't seem entirely just, I love Braveheart and coincidentally it also won 5 Academy Awards, but I feel they are both excellent films and two stand-out epics.  THey are certainly two of the best epics that have come out in the last 10 years.  Also many comparisons have made between this film, \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Troy.\\" <br />While I did enjoy \\"Troy,\\" and thought it was a tremendously entertaining film, I feel that \\"Gladiator\\" was a more substantial film with a better script and better acting.  In terms of action, well that's hard to say.  Both deliver excellent action sequences, but Troy's action sequences are bigger, considering some of the action sequences are major battles.   <br />     Overall this film is a beautiful movie, with an excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and is certainly much better than Troy's soundtrack by James Horner, though that isn't a terrible soundtrack.  This is a must-own film or at least rent it.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is one of my personal favorites of all time. It is just plain funny but I am pretty sure it has meaning. I watched it about five times before I went searching for literary meaning. The short of it is the Big Lebowski is an allegory of the first Iraq war. I might be crazy but the sasporila drinking cowboy-narator brings the war up. Sadaam hands the protaganist the Dude (Bush) bowling shoes in a dream sequence. Goodman plays a stereotypical viet vet as humorosly as possible representing our military's tacticly static higher ups. Donny's (Buechimi) a third in the group who wonders haplessly into conversations only to be chastised by Goodman's character. He is the public. The nearly aimless reign of Sadaam is represented by nialist stereotypical Germans. Who cut off a girlfriends toe to fake a ransom to someonse with the Dudes last name - the Big Lebowski. Some guys pee on his rug (Kuwait). He grabs another. Because Bunny owed the local pornographer money. One nialist appeared in a film with Bunny. She is the Big Lebowski's nympho wife. He is big buisness. He hires the Dude to handoff money for Bunny's safety  and is let down by the Dude and his militaristic buddy.  The nialists faked her kidnapping and the Dude is strongly discouraged by a pornographer (the press) from envestigating her absence. She is innocent casualties. \\"Her\\" toe represents the false reports just before the war of icubaters being stolen in Kuwait by Iraq during their invasion. I think. Oh yeah Maude (BG's daughter) is the liberal community who steals back the Dude's rug and alters his veiw on the whole deal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Never in a thousand years would I have thought I would like this movie. As a matter of fact I would bet the farm I wouldn't have liked it at all. But had I done just that I would have lost.<br /><br />The gritty honesty in the characters, their ingenuity, their friendship, their loyalty and their bravery all excellent character traits, and displayed in this movie quite well. The honesty from the opening credits let's you know that this is a low budget movie about real people so you know not to expect any fancy special effects or stunts for example. The ingenuity displayed by the characters for example Pedro's use of a cake to ask girls out on dates is perfect. It shows the right amount of thoughtfulness and romance, just exactly the sort of things women of all ages love. The friendship displayed between Napoleon and Pedro helping each other out in the movie. The loyalty Napoleon displays by buying his friend a wig when he wanted something for himself. The bravery Napoleon displayed going on stage to help out his friend.<br /><br />There are many moments like these through out the movie. It is the kind of movie the makes you feel like a better person for watching it. It is the kind of movie however one can easily overlook. And now after watching Napoleon Dynamite I can honestly say that had I NOT seen this movie, I would have lost.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I bought this album on cassette back in 1984 and it instantly became a favorite of mine.  You know it's a good album when you don't at all feel compelled to fast forward through any songs.  I never had to with this one.  All the songs are fantastic.  When I first saw her on TV (on \\"Solid Gold\\" around 1983) I didn't think she'd be a huge star, but when I bought this album a few months later, I realized that she would be.<br /><br />I recently bought it on CD so I could rip the songs and put them on my MP3 player.  I have to say I don't think the songs feel dated in any way.  They're still as enjoyable and refreshing as ever.  I highly recommend buying this album.  I wish someone would come around and make an album similar to this so to revive today's brain-dead pop scene.  An album like this one is sorely needed today.
6302212529|5.0|I'm a 22 year old male, I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid but I watched it the other night and it brought back so many good memories, I remembered how great Disney movies were back then. This was the perfect story with the perfect characters, one of the best films.    For a lot of us this movie along with numerous others from Disney are real special to us. If you haven't seen this (I doubt many haven't) then you need to.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|If you are thinking about watching/buying this movie DON'T! I actually bought it because a friend said it was funny.  It is truly one of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
