B002KQ6BT6|4.0|A little flat at times compared to his other books but great ending. I would recommend it for sure before a trip to DC
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A must read for fantasy fans and a personal favourite of mine. I recommend it to anyone within earshot. At all times.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I'm a big &#34;Les Miserables&#34; fan, including the book and the stage musical. I was very excited about the film, and saw it on opening week. To say it exceeded my expectations is saying quite a lot, because I was enthralled by the trailer and expected a great deal. I've never liked Eddie Redmayne before, and have always found the character of Marius problematic in all versions of the material, but I ended up liking both actor and character a lot more. Hugh Jackman gives a restrained and appealing performance as Jean Valjean, the angry, haunted thief who learns that &#34;to love another person is to see the face of God&#34;, Anne Hathaway deserved all the accolades and awards she won, and Samantha Banks is a revelation as the tragic Eponine. As for Russell Crowe, while his vocal interpretation of Javert is very different from the acclaimed actors who played the Inspector on stage, I found it a more than satisfactory choice, and his acting was, as usual, excellent. I don't understand the hostility he's received for this film.<br /><br />Tom Hooper (&#34;The King's Speech&#34;) brings the people and settings to vivid life - he draws from Hugo's book to deepen the musical, and the choice to have the actors sing live (the movie is virtually sung-through) adds immediacy and connects the characters more thoroughly to each other and the audience.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|This game was an ok game but just wasn't what I was expecting in a game. it would be a great kids game.
B003UESJF6|5.0|perfect example how not all animated films are for kids.  kids would never catch the marlon brando/superman references.  hubs hadn't seen it til i ordered it; he enjoyed watching it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I was disappointed in the ending after a promising start to the story.  It is the only book by that author I have read and I would not buy another.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is quicker with updates and alerts on the fly then using web log on.  Screen setup is close to actually pc.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't know for sure when I started the book if it was something I was going to like. After a couple of chapters I was hooked. Sarcastic, funny, emotional roller coaster with a lot of twists,<br />Enjoyed it ever much!
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I love everything Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are in. Nick frost especially in this movie gives a great performance. I laughed from start to finish.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried every keyboard on the market and always come back to SwiftKey. It keeps coming out with better features. Nothing can compare to it.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should just watch it...it should be required viewing in any motion picture related college course.<br />'nuf said.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|why i took so much year to find the treasure (alchemist) ?? Excellent for every youth i suggest this to all my younger brothers before they explore their world after their schooling.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|I heard drive home on a local college station and bought the CD that day.  With Amazons instant rip feature I was able to download and listen to in the car on my way home from work. This is good music. I am new to the genre but my musical tastes date back to the early 70's and I can definitely hear Genesis, King Crimson and even a touch of Pink Floyd in the structure of the music. I like long changing musical pieces. And I was pleasantly surprised with the jazzy feel of the bass and drums. The production is also good. I will be looking into more of Steven Wilson and even Porcupine Tree and other like groups in the genre. I give it a strong 4 stars but I may come back and add a star if I still like it in a month. It seems to get better with every listen.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is like better than the other star girl. It still has the same clothes and other stuff but the street looks different and it way better lookin than star girl. xD
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's really easy and fun to use. I'm bored so ppl plz kik me!<br />User: lightningfang 19<br />ONLY PPL 12 -16<br />13 f US Chicago
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Back in '87 I packed my entire CD library (all 15 - remember the media was still new and they were $20 plus each) and headed off to college. I'm proud to say that The Cult's &#34;Electric&#34; made the trip and received well deserved rotation in my dorm room CD player. That CD's been repurchased several times and includes the rare/deleted Japanese 1996 re-issue. If somehow, for some reason, you've missed out on this album- buy it now. This is, by far, the best sounding version (from a CD perspective) and crushes the Japanese over-priced/distorted/sound boosted/etc. version. I understand it may be from the same source tapes as the domestic re-issue but that's not the point: YOU GET &#34;PEACE&#34;! I'm a big Rick Rubin fan, clearly love the released &#34;Electric&#34; format but must admit that &#34;Peace&#34; is so much better. The Cult sound amazing and it's clear that they were on top of their game, having fun, and performed unrestricted. This is a 50 minute jam session spread across 11 tracks. It's great that this is being made available again (outside of the deleted box set) and the price point is spot on. &#34;Peace is (not) a dirty word&#34;...satisfy your soul, update your 80's haircut, and re-join The Cult!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many books this last year but this one went EVERYWHERE with me...well, except the shower! Maybe that is too much information...but, if you are looking for a little adventure, a blast from the past, and a thrill ride all in one, you will love this book. King has gone to great strides to keep the reader guessing what will happen next. Before you know it, dinner will be burning on the stove and you'll be calling for takeout. Do yourself a favor and make the call first!
B00C5JMPH0|5.0|Disney's Pollyanna is one of my favorite movies from my youth.  I was lucky enough to catch it on television a few weeks ago.  I always wondered what had happened to Pollyanna after then end of the movie. I ordered both books for my Kindle.  As usual the  first book is different from the film; but just as enjoyable.  Book one and book two of Pollyanna, presents a much simpler time, introduces and continues the Glad Game.
B00DFFHUUA|3.0|it was okay for the second GI Joe I didn't like the how it ended I think you could and it better that could have been more action.
B0091REZMW|5.0|So far this game is pretty fun, until it reminds you to rate it every second you open the game. Diamond cost to much and objects in the game cost to many diamonds.
158270208X|3.0|Having read The Secret and The Power I was expecting something more of a thought provoking work. This book is basically a journal with a gratitude guide for each day. I could have bought a journal and written that for which I'm grateful, which I do, for less money. I am practicing gratitude daily and this work did inspire me to do more.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This is a great movie. The Xmen movies are among the best movies out there. You won't be disappointed by it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really got hooked on this game. It's new update El Machos lair is cool too! It's a great kid friendly game
0793573742|5.0|There are lots of pretenders to the throne, even recent entries to the fray, but none compare to this simple, classic and elegantly constructed tribute to the legendary '58-'60 Les Paul guitars.  Fantastic quality and lavishly illustrated, this tells you everything you need to know.<br /><br />Simply the best photos, detailed analysis and specs for even the biggest guitar geeks, this book nails it where others fail miserably.  If you have space on your shelf for one book about American vintage guitars from this classic era, THIS is the one to get!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Purchased this for a trip. Both children and I were able to watch movies and play games the two hours we were at the airport and on the entire plane ride.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Really nice and addictive RPG that has high replayability.<br />A lot of freedom in the world and a lot of variation in the combat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really got hooked on this game. It's new update El Machos lair is cool too! It's a great kid friendly game
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I just love this group. Their music is so uplifting and great for dancing. I wish they had more albums.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|I really like this app, but I cannot for the life of me find the MENU button on this app using my Kindle Fire HD. Is it me?!?
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Your app sucks ok it stop every time I press on a video and the video stops when you when you won't to read comments
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so much fun.  It's easy to play, but it's good at making you think.  It's easy to play anywhere.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wonderful book can't wait for it to continue, with a new one. I read all three of them. I wish they would never end.
B009NY43NY|5.0|a truly enjoyable read, I would recommend it to a friend.  I would even read it again if I had to.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The Song of Fire and Ice series is a work of proper genius. Martin does an incredible job of capturing everything that makes the medieval / fantasy era engaging while providing a character and political drama that is simply unparalleled. While certainly a long story, this is a fast read due to the richness and detail of the characters and their interactions in Martin's universe. Strongly recommend. If you've been under a rock these last few years and somehow missed the T.V. series, it would be well worth your time to watch each season upon the completion of each book. The show's writers did a great job casting the individual characters and capturing Martin's overall spirit within this epic.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|THis has become one of my all time favorites! Lots of critical praises went to Jennifer Lawrence, but I think Bradley Cooper nailed his character in this movie. It's funny and heartwarming.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Started watching Season 3 and loved it. Buying Season 2 allowed me to catch up on the back ground. Was delivered promptly and worked perfectly. Thank you Amazon!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a powerful film that highlights the fortitude, character, and leadership skills of one of our nation's greatest presidents during the last four months of his life.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|The Dollhouse series aired for just two seasons, but it's a gem. Like all good Sci-Fi, it raises a lot of social issues. What may be unique here is that there is no black-and-white. There are at least two sides to every issue. No character is completely good or completely bad either. The plot lines are complex, intriguing and close enough to reality to be believable. Season 2 continues the marvelous story of Echo (Eliza Dushku) and the other &#34;dolls,&#34; taking the story to new heights of intrigue and imagination. It's TV at its best, as far as I'm concerned.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This was a great little book with a lot of valuable information. I would suggest it to anyone and everyone.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This is a light, funny film that would be great to watch as a family. Streisand and Rogen make a believable mother-son duo.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I bought the full version and both me and my kids love it. I can't get the husband off if it either lol
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|We love Merlin. Its funny,good interplay between the stars. Good acting. We're sorry that it ended. As you can tell we really enjoyed every episode.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This film was entertaining, Paul Rudd was great as usual. Although, it was somewhat predictable and at times progressed slowly.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The build quality is excellent. The whole installation and set up, including attaching the cables took less than five minutes. Just one recommendation: Even if you don't need the HDMI extender, you may want to still use it since it greatly improves the Wifi signal.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|The whole series was fun. They took a subject and put a new twist on it. Never boring.Alway good for a laugh. The actors all played well off of each other. Sorry to see it go away.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I think the time to end the Jack Reacher series has come.  The book was bland and absolutely NOTHING like the earlier novels.<br /><br />Definitely NOT worth the cost of $9.99 for the kindle version.  I am happy I didn't buy it but borrowed it from the library.
B0000009RT|5.0|from '69 when I 1st heard it. Biting social commentary from the time - and still relevant today - unfortunately. :(
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show that keeps you watching for hours. I had never seen this show on tv but now i am hooked
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's really fun to play. More addicting than candy crush saga. New to this gaming thing but I am having fun doing it. Will be looking for more games like this.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The graphics is wonderful and attactive.  It is fun and free of annoying bugs.  I play this with the computer everyday.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Don't know what all the hype is about,  nothing extraordinary about this Ap.  I have returned to the regular free version.
B002V091K2|4.0|Nineteen minutes, Good griping book but unfortunately I had it predicated early on the ending. Would recommend though to friends.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I love everything sherlock holmes.  I read and watch anything sherlock holmes and so when I saw this on kindle and it was free.  I immediately got it , read it and enjoyed it.  Thanks amazon.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Fun game but has a bad glitch! It kept closing &amp; stopping no longer allowing me to play then also start closing &amp; stopping other apps......had to delete but was really a fun game.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I came into this movie wanting something light and fantasy filled and with some comedy and visual effects and got just that. Don't expect it to measure up to Lord of the Rings, because it is not supposed to. It is a fairy tale that is both unassuming and playful. It can be watched with kids or as a date night flick.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game wow! Love it live it love love it.you have to get it. It will drive you nuts, you have to get it!!! It looks likes Rubik cube but plays more like tetris..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its fun, really addicting but it closes me out at random times would have given it 5 stars if it didn't do that. but overall its a fun and really addicting game
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I have the product, it is a mediocre amp.  But for the price, portability and build quality, it is 100% worth buying for a portable setup.  It serves its purpose admirably.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is rad!! It reminds me of age cool game I played in the 70's . This game is addictive, you can hardly put it down.!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I just dont get it! Every time I think I like a movie. Somebody goes and ruins it for the second installment.  First, I want to say what I am sure everybody else wants to say: Bruce Willis needs a vacation!  I am tired of his blank-faced, non-emotional acting techniques.  I am tired of Executives using him as the Movie Reccurecting Messiah.  Lets face it: this was a horrible movie. Everyone looked sloppy, and didnt really care about they characters.  Dewayne Johnson's acting skills goes far as him holding a big gun and looking serious, and lets not forget that stupid fake grin of his.  They ruin it for me. This is the last time I will be watching this series, and its ashame. Well, at least, I have the classic cartoons as a great memory of this great show. FYI: I want my rental money refunded!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by Reza Aslan<br /><br />In his Author's Notes, Dr. Aslan says that he \\"found\\" Jesus at 15 years old after he and his family moved to America. One of the most interesting parts of the Zealot is the Introduction. It is fascinating why Aslan pursued the life of Jesus of Nazareth. He begins his Introduction by,<br /><br />\\"It is a miracle that we know anything at all about the man called Jesus of Nazareth.\\"1<br /><br />Evidently, Aslan's going to tie into that miracle and make it live for us as facts. He further states that, he is not talking about Jesus the Christ, but the man called, Jesus of Nazareth. This is a very important point to remember for readers of this book. To know the man, it is important to know his times, culture, and history. Aslan has done a remarkable job in reporting the history and culture of Jesus' time.<br /><br />Not at all am I dismayed by Aslan's religion or some opinions with which I disagree. For instance in chapter 3, Aslan describes Nazareth,<br />\\"There is no synagogue.\\" 2<br /><br />He states further,<br />Luke's \\"...narrative of Jesus at the (nonexistent) synagogue at Nazareth reading the Isaiah scroll to the astonishment of the Pharisees (Luke 14: 16-22) are both fabulous concoctions of the evangelist's own devising.\\" 3<br /><br />However, in his Notes he tempers these statements,<br />\\"...Despite the stories in the gospels about Jesus preaching in his hometown's synagogue, no archaeological evidence has been unearthed to indicate the presence of a synagogue in ancient Nazareth, though there very well could have been a small structure that served as such (remember that `synagogue' in Jesus's time could mean something as simple as a room with a Torah scroll.)\\" 4<br /><br />Another point I'd like to discuss is concerning Jesus' two commandments, the love of God and the love of one's neighbor. Aslan says that one's neighbor, according to Jesus, was only among other Jews. According to Matthew, when Jesus was asked just who was his neighbor, he replied with the parable of the Good Samaritan pointing out to the most hated and rejected people who were anathema to the Jews as their neighbor.<br /><br />Aslan has an answer to that:<br />\\"Christians have long interpreted this parable as reflecting the importance of helping those in distress. But for the audience gathered at Jesus's feet, the parable would have had less to do with the goodness of the Samaritan than with the baseness of the two priests.\\" 5<br /><br />I do not believe the above; I'll hold to the principle that Jesus was pointing out that everyone is my neighbor.<br /><br />One of Aslan's discussions concerns the reply that Jesus made to Pontius Pilot,<br />\\" My kingdom is not of this world.\\"<br /><br />Since it was reported that Jesus said more than once that he was from God and that the Kingdom of God is in you and among you, I appreciated what Aslan had to say about the statement below that Jesus' Kingdom was not of this world.<br />\\"Jesus was not claiming that the Kingdom of God is unearthly; he was saying it is unlike any kingdom or government on earth.\\" 6<br /><br />Aslan's above statement resonated with me heartily and I agree with it.<br /><br />Much more could be discussed about this book, but I'd like to end this very long review by saying that it is a worthwhile book to read for all Jesus scholars and disciples and in Aslan's own words,<br />\\"The Jesus that is uncovered in the process may not be the Jesus we expect; he certainly will not be the Jesus that most modern Christians would recognize. But in the end, he is the only Jesus that we can access by historical means. Everything else is a matter of faith. 7<br /><br />Respectively submitted,<br />J.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very fun and easy to play. It takes a bit of patience but it makes it just a tiny bit challenging and I like that
0140544518|5.0|My children love this! I was so excited to be able to share it with them. So glad I found it at a cheap price too!
B0089XH38M|1.0|it says I have a threat in security, I go to click on the link it gives me to fix it and it pops up force close or wait. it doesn't work. uninstalling. I have avg on my laptop &amp; it works fine. on my kindle, I am uninstalling. :(
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|If you enjoyed the original series with Bruce Campbell then you will probably not like this movie.  It takes away all of the humor of the series and turns it into a shell of itself.  On its own merits the movie is a cheap slasher flick with overtones of the exorcist in it, there is a spattering of &#34;evil Dead&#34; in the flick so that it could be called thus but be under no illusions this movie is not worth watching.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is still one of my favorites to watch. Absolutely love Mary Louise Parker in this movie, her and Bruce have great chemistry. Helen Mirren is amazing in this movie. Its good for laughs and action.
030758836X|1.0|I have never reviewed anything before but I had to review this book.  I hated this book.  It started out fairly well and seemed like an interesting mystery but the further I got into it, the more I hated almost every one of the characters.  It was a waste of my time and I don't generally feel that way about most books that I read.  The main characters are vile, hate-filled people who have no redeeming qualities.  The language got really old and so did the sexual situations.  I found myself skipping through pgs in order to find out what happens in the end (hoping it had a good ending) to be very disappointed.  I'm glad that I got it through the library so I didn't waste my money after it coming highly recommended to me.  Definitely don't waste your money on this one.  I'm still trying to figure out why they would want to waste money and time on making a movie out of this book.
B002M3SP28|4.0|Did George Mallory and Sandy Irvine reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1924? No one knows the answer to that question, since both men died during their descent. Mallory's body was found in 1999, but Irvine's remains missing; and the camera they had with them also remains missing. So the mystery continues, and it's a romantic one that easily captures the imagination even if you're not an Everest geek like me.<br /><br />Novelist Jeffrey Archer takes this true story and turns it into intriguing fiction. I noticed the places where he took dramatic license, but a reader who hasn't read a great deal of Everest nonfiction would not do so; and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad one. I'd rather know when license was taken, because the truth matters to me. But did Archer write a darn fine story? He did, indeed.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\"

159463176X|2.0|I have read Hosseini's other work.......this one just doesn't hold up!  I just didn't get the confusing story lines, going from all these odd characters to another.  He could have done less explanations of them, and focused more on the three sibling's lives and their adventures.  None of them ever really got to truly reconnect at the end.  The book just lacked any luster.  Not sure why this book has received 5 stars.....?  Still admire Khaled Hosseini!
B0001MLMKY|3.0|It works fine - thought it might look somewhat more attractive on my wrist - nothing out of the ordinary

B00006AW2J|5.0|A real Rock & Roll classic. Bought this on vinyl decades ago and lost is along the way. Heard on Pandora and had to het it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I preferred the original version. How do I delete locations? This new version is way too complicated and maps take too long to load.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great app because if you want or like taking care of horses then you get to.

B0061S0A64|5.0|You can easily make amazing music. Other music apps are difficult to use and are complicated but this app is simple and worth every cent. If you are trying to make music and aren't good at it, this is very good practice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it I wish I own the game.  I what the dad but I can not get it good you get him
B005544V6A|4.0|The plots for each episode are interesting and entertaining, but overall the story isn't always believable.  Love the actors, sets and costumes. Character development sometimes move slowly, with repetitive behaviors and dialog.  I see Suits as a fast paced, modern Ally McBeal or LA Law.  I will definitely keep watching to see what happens to these characters.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, and play it very often; so I was a little impatient to get the update. I removed and re-downloaded the app to get it sooner. I still had my highscore, but lost ALL my upgrades, AND my limited people and boards I had bought; which are no longer availble. It's a good game, just don't make the mistake that I did.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, I am only in the first season and i see why the show is still running. Very well done.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works really well with Netflix and YouTube. All I need is Hulu support and that would cover 100% of my use case.<br /><br />I was particularly pleased to find that YouTube videos look so great when compared to how YouTube videos looked on my TV via Xbox 360. For some reason the Xbox wouldn't show the best quality image on the YouTube app. That's definitely not a problem with the Chromecast.<br /><br />The Beta feature of streaming video from your PC Chrome browser is a mixed bag. Trying to stream from my 5 yr old laptop, the video was stuttering and audio sync was way off by a few seconds. When I tried from my desktop it worked way better. I was shocked to see the video looked excellent and crisp, but audio sync was just every so slightly off still.<br /><br />Now I was trying this at the 720 P High setting. On my laptop, when I reduced it to 720P Low bit rate and 480p bitrate, it worked much better but my laptop experience was still crappy. I did not try to stream using the low bit rate 720p from my desktop but I'm pretty sure that would probably have worked great and still looked quite acceptable.<br /><br />So please note that there definitely is a difference in how well the Beta feature of PC streaming will work depending on how powerful your computer is. If you have an old laptop or desktop, you may as well forget about that feature unless you choose the 480p setting.<br /><br />I'm quite certain that if your computers are also placed far away from your wireless router and don't get the best signal, then you will probably also have a subpar experience.<br /><br />But I repeat, that feature is still in Beta, which means its still undergoing refinement and testing even though it is a public beta. Don't buy the Chrome Cast device just for the streaming feature unless you have an excellent, newer, speedy computer, with equally excellent internet connection between all of your devices.<br /><br />A HUGE CON!!! That everyone should know:<br />I have 30 gigs of my own music that I uploaded to Google Music when the service first went live. It took me days to upload all that stuff and I've been using it now without issues since the Google Music service began. The sticking point is that when you attempt to Chromecast your music that you uploaded yourself to Google, you get the following error message:<br /><br />&#34;Playback error&#34;<br />&#34;Unable to play that song. Can't play a sideloaded song remotely.&#34;<br /><br />And then you have to click &#34;Done&#34; and that's it. Your songs simply will not play. I have to figure out what the policy is here and if there is any work around. But for now, I can't play any of my 30 gigs of music on Google Music via Chromecast which is really a feature I was looking forward too.music that I uploaded to Google Music when the service first went live.

B000YPWDSS|3.0|I wish this CD wasn't so compressed and sounded more natural; but I guess this is the way all CDs are made now.  I already had Back to Black but bought this for the Bonus CD.  I like the Bonus CD better than the main CD.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was listed on a must read books for summer. I read it while I was on vaction, and it was wonderful. A great read, the narration is very good and you really feel for the boy who is listening to the tapes trying to figure out where he fits in.<br />I would definitely recommend this book!
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|In my opinion, BSB's newest CD, In a World Like This, is a pretty good album and won't disappoint old time fans. I'm not going to do a review on each song on the album, but I will say that the entire album has a mellow & positive vibe that I really like. My favorite song is the title track, \\"In a World Like This\\", and my least favorite is \\"Feels Like Home\\", only because it reminds me too much of Pitbull's \\"International Love\\".<br /><br />I have not always been a BSB fan, and I'm ashamed to admit that in the 90's I actually liked NSYNC better. BUT, that all changed after seeing BSB in concert (Black & Blue tour). These guys can really sing! What struck me the most about this \\"boy band\\" is that each one of them can sing in their own right, but when they sing together...I can't even put it into words! It's just beautiful! Another thing that sets these guys apart is that you can see/feel how much they appreciate their fans. They also genuinely like each other, which comes through in their music.<br /><br />Again, In a World Like This is a good album which won't disappoint. But, I have to admit that I am a little biased because I believe these guys can sing anything, in any music genre, and they will still sound amazing!

B0029O0BKO|5.0|This film is a high water mark in the canon of national treasure Sly Stallone. Full of emotion, inspiration, empowerment and lessons on what it means to be a man. I ordered this blu ray version after sadly coming to the realization that the well-deserved Criterion edition would never come to be. Apparently, the folks at Criterion wanted to dub the film into French and remove all the color. When Sly heard this he turned his hat backwards and crushed their disc-pressing machine in a John Henry-style, man-vs-machine arm wrestling battle.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I Really like these kind of shows. Definitely is worth watching to see that you agree with my opinion ....(is going to be a sequel ?)thank you seller for the prompt shipment and condition stated....

B00CO8D3G4|2.0|Some good advice and pointers. Probably would be enjoyed<br />Much more by an extrovert. Most of the advice was unsuitable for introverts and shy people who aren't looking to come out of their shells. But give it a try, it just didn't work for me.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|I really enjoyed this intriguing and engaging book. Although lengthy, the novel is worth the time to read and savor.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|This books is such a wonderful read. I blazed right through it. It was impossible to put down. Charlie's journey is such a tear-jerker!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Disney once again funnels too much money into projects that are poorly written and poorly acted. You can't depend on special effects to carry the whole show. Photography, sound, makeup and wardrobe are all top notch but rigging all that up to people who should never have been type cast with the horrible story board...well, it was a recipe for disaster and the shame of it was it could have been so good if only another production company and distributor had done it. Now Dreamworks could have probably pulled it off. Save your money folks, its a stinker.
B005CFVSYK|3.0|I got one for my mom, she actually chose it, I decided I'd get it for myself to. I found it hurt my feet (got a little blister from it) although it looked cute(I have the croc's Carlie which is my favorite - have 2), and my daughter decided to take over this shoe once her feet got large enough, it gave her a couple of blisters too. My mom likes them but wears them with socks(!) I have a feeling they would hurt her as well w/o socks.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was ok, although I thought at some places the writing style was less polished than I would have expected. Certainly tittilating in its content.  But I thought the ending was particularly weak.  Maybe it was deliberately abrupt in anticipation of the next book ... which I probably won't read.
B009NQZVKG|1.0|Very fast pace but no character development, no believable people; just a jumble of barely described scientific terms upon which is hung a fast moving but juvenile plot.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Overall this watch is very high quality. It loses very little time and is automatic, so no need to worry about batteries if you wear it event day. A big plus for me is that the ticking is very quiet. It is almost never noticeable. The canvas strap takes some getting used to, but this isn't an issue for long. There is also always the option to swap it out with another. It has started to fray slightly after only about a week, but it seems like this will stop due to the stitching.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What a fantastic gadget for us.  I was about ready to buy a Roku or a Blue ray player with Wi-Fi, or other gizmo to receive wireless streaming from my wireless router and this little gadget does what I want so far= NetFlix and YouTube through an HDMI port for my HDTV. Quality of content varies depending on who recorded it so NetFlix is exceptionally great and YouTube depends on who recorded the clip you are watching.  I have't tried other apps yet as this is enough to keep me in content for quite awhile.  Simple setup, just plugged it in, downloaded the Chromecast app on my smartphone, set up user ID & password, then downloaded the Netflix and YouTube apps to start & Que-up movies or other content and then turn off the phone.  Everything runs over my unlimited TWC cable WiFi so I see no increase in my cellphone wireless data usage.  What a deal, I can't say enough good things about it= 10 stars.
0783240287|5.0|I love this musical! I first saw it at one of the local highschools. I saw it next at a theatre I do stuff at. Then, I found out my parents had it on tape. When I finally watched it, I was blown away! Donny was SO amazing. He looked, and sounded, the part. Maria Friedman was also wonderful as the Narrator. Joan Collins was cast perfectly, enough said. Richard Attenbourogh (Hope I spelled it right.) did great as Jacob. I LOVED watching his facial expressions. He really played the part. All the songs were beautifully performed and sung. Personally, Canaan Days to the credits was my favorite part. The brothers were really funny in some parts. Especially when they started grovelling. And Judah was halarious during Benjamin Calypso. And when I saw Benjamin's face, I almost felt scared myself. Then I almost cried there during Joseph All The Time. Benjamin just wouldn't believe that Joseph was his brother until he relized what all his brothers were doing. Also, the funniest part of Canaan Days was when Simeon covered Benjamin's eyes when Zebulun was dancing with the Apache Dancer. (Who also happened to be the actress who played his wife.) I could really tell Benjamin was the youngest. And you could also see how much Joseph had grown up in the end. Well done Donny! This movie made this musical my favorite musical of all time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes musicals and Bible stories. But, I have to say that some of the women's costumes are a bit if-y. Places to look for this are during the Potiphar song, and all of the scenes in Egypt. Also, some of the Go Go Go Joseph costumes are wierd, but none showimg anything inapropriate. Also, the Apache Dancer can seem a bit sugestive. But remember, unless you've raised your 5 year old so he/she knows about this stuff, they will only see a lady dancing. And the revealing costumes aren't so wierd to younger kids. In fact, there not showing anything at all! It just looks that way. The women are actually wearing skin colored body suits. But I recommened this to people of all ages. It really is a fun musical. It's full of laughs, and maybe a tear here and there, but wonderful. And colorful!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|As I played subway surfers I found it to be challenging yet fun and I liked that you can change your character as well although it is pretty hard to collect coins to get the item. I'd also like to give u all a key tip don't waste it life keys only use them when your getting a lot further and its super fast and something else don't waste it hover boards till then either but other then that I loved it so give it a try I'm sure you'll like it. ^-^

B004LQEYAG|5.0|Saw the movie when it came out and a few times on tv over the years, it's<br />a classic. Great stuff.
0345537998|4.0|GRRM is a very good author when he actually writes. These are a series of hos older stories, and they hold up well.<br /><br />Tuf is very odd, and a force to be reckoned with. He definitely always looks \\"outside the box\\"- though that trivializes hios perspective.Things tend to get complicated round him, though he himself is rather zen about it all.<br /><br />Also he loves pussycats, which I find endearing.<br /><br />In some ways, these are more like mystery stories than sf; and GRRM owes a lot to Christie et alia in making these puzzle-stories.<br /><br />I did really love the book, though, and would definitely read more about Tuf.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I ordered the wrong cd, it was my fault for not paying attention. But it still has some good songs.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark is one of the rare American songwriters who can paint a picture and evoke a specific emotion with perfectly simple, profound verses.  His latest collection of songs has a sense of poignancy that can only be achieved with the reflection that comes with age.<br /><br />Clark's voice is still mesmerizing.  You get the feeling that you're listening to a sage.  The title track will become a staple in the genre of serious love songs--right up there with a classic like Far Side Bank of Jordan.  This is a beautiful, pure collection of American music.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. So much detail I could see the circus. It was hard at times being moved back and forth in time but it was worth it in the end to stick with it.
0470474874|5.0|If you use Excel for anything at all you should get this book. Full of tips to make your life easier.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This is another book that did not live up to it's hype to me. I thought the idea was great and there were moments I loved, but the parts that annoyed far out weighed those.<br /><br />Mainly I was annoyed with the Abby/Travis relationship. They are close then push away. OVER AND OVER AND OVER. It was too much. Abby was a drama queen, but I felt like it came from both her and Travis. There could have more to their relationship, but instead they just fought. Usually over something really, really dumb.<br /><br />With Travis, he drove me crazy by being so needy. Seriously dude? Get your crap together. If I was dating someone who acted like he was going crazy and little child without me by his side... I would be running the opposite direction. To me that was a HUGE flaw in his character that I just couldn't get passed.<br /><br />If some of the drama had been cut out of the book. If Travis and Abby had actually talked to each other and stopped running back and forth. If it didn't feel like half the book wasn't on repeat.<br />Like I said to me the book fell way short. It annoyed me more than anything and I was really disappointed that it was not as great as I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this one or reading the Walking Disaster. I barely made it through the story the first time around. Most reviews are how awesome this book is. You be the judge. I would love to hear what you thought about it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written, superbly acted, should I say more? I am so glad I came across this show. I am tired of all the other same old, predictable, boring shows. Finally a good one.<br />I was hesitant at first, to watch it or not (because it is about lawyers), but I am so glad I did.<br />Season 1 was good, but Season 2 is great! Can't wait for Season 3!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The author did a great job of describing the Presidents and their relationships with one another.  Even though some did not like each other they worked together for the common good of the people.  I learned a lot about the characters of our Presidents through this insightful history and some were not so reputable.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I used these regularly for running.  Sure, they broke after about 3 months, but that didn't matter because they were only a few dollars to replace.  Now they are $40???  DO NOT BUY THESE FOR $40.  They are not worth $40.  This seller should be ashamed for trying to rip off consumers.

B000UAFDP2|1.0|I can't really rate this product.  I had to return it because the Blu-ray format (MP2) was incompatible with my player.  Amazon should make an effort to inform potential purchasers of their videos which format they are purchasing.
B0090SI582|5.0|James Mangold is a good director and I like Hugh Jackman's performance. It is powerful. I found the storyline and dialogue to be outstanding. There is a lot of energy up there on the screen, but it does not translate emotionally. It has that emotional charge that really engages you. THE WOLVERINE is just as engaging as director's James Mangold's highly underrated COP LAND. This film is a powerhouse of entertainment. Don't miss it!

B0061S0A64|5.0|Come on Amazon!  This app is indeed a decent app and I can't knock the developers, but Amazon might have a short memory.  Well hopefully someone that missed it the first time around, will enjoy this unique and entertaining app.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|This bag was much, much smaller than it looked in the pictures.  I have a Canon 6D with battery grip and it stuck out a full 2-3 inches from the side at least (from the LCD screen up).  Even without the grip the pentaprism/hotshoe area was still exposed over the zipper - and since that is where the GPS and Wifi antennas are (plus the viewfinder and hotshoe) It made me too uncomfortable to use.  Even my Rebel Xti with grip was too big to for the sides to zip comfortably.  I wanted a bag that I could put the camera in w/grip and lens attatched - but no luck.  Ended up sending it back immediately (first thing I ever sent back from Amazon).<br /><br />It may be good for beginners or hobbyist, but definitely not for professionals like myself, and I don't have a ton of equipment either.  I have 3 lenses (one big zoom), 2 speedlites, the aforemention cameras and some other accessories (like a gary fong).  There was not a prayer of fitting it all.  Just my Black Rapid Cargo strap took up about 1/3 of the bag.  I was going to upload a customer pic, but it looks like they have been removed.  The ones that were up made me confident I could fit my whole rig, but it was a no go for sure.<br /><br />Not a bad bag, just not for people with much gear.

B00009P1O0|4.0|I'm giving the album 4 stars based on comparisons to other Neil Young albums which I own.<br />The music is pretty good and the lyrics, at times, are quite clever.<br />However, I can think of several other albums which I enjoy even more,, beginning with &#34;Freedom&#34;, &#34;Rust Never Sleeps&#34;, &#34;Ragged Glory&#34; and &#34;Unplugged&#34;.<br />William Ruhlman's review, in the &#34;All Music Guide to Rock&#34; says: &#34;The barbs were mixed with humor and even affection, as  Young seemed to be emerging from the grief and self-abuse that had plagued him for two years. But the album was so spare and under-produced, its lyrics so harrowing, that it was easy to miss Young's conclusion: He was saying goodbye to despair, not being overwhelmed by it.&#34;<br />One interesting side note: The song &#34;Walk On&#34; is Neil's answer to Lynard Skynard's &#34;Sweet Home Alabama.&#34;

B0058YPGL6|5.0|If you would have told me I would become a total fan of a modern twist on a 80's classic with overtly Twilightish undertones, I would have scoffed at the thought.  I knew of this show years ago and refused to watch it but recently when I was too lazy to look for my remote I was forced to face my fears head on during a back-to-back airing of Season 3 episodes.  After 5 minutes, I was hooked.  I was dismayed that I did not know any backstory and had no idea who was who, but the acting was actually believable and every main character was easy on the eyes, literally, there is not a ugly main character to be seen ( I could see the appeal to the younger demographic).  So I did what any nerd would do, I went onto Netflix and had a marathon watch-a-thon from Season 1 onward.  You do not have to wait long to get introduced into the supernatural element of this series and moments of suspense were aplenty from starting with the pilot episode.  The two main guys you first are introduced to &#34;Scott&#34; and &#34;Stiles&#34; are the central protagonists.  For being the &#34;nerdy, unpopular guys&#34; they resemble the handsome guys that usually would roll with the popular crew in any realistic high school.  Portrayed by Tyler Posey and Dylan O'Brien respectively, both actors really dive into their reality of underdogs, and through them we meet the other main characters &#34;Allison&#34;, &#34;Lydia&#34;, and &#34;Jackson, etc.&#34; aka the other ridiculously hot main characters.  The usual high school angst ensues centered around the sport of lacrosse with the guys, blossoming teen love and star crossed lovers, and hilarious encounters with the parental units of all involved.  The first main werewolf we meet &#34;Derek Hale&#34; is played by the ever so rugged and handsome Tyler Hoechlin. I will not bog this review down with every plot detail, but believe me the story lines are mostly riveting and the show really knows how to ramp up the suspenseful moments.  For all those that enjoy the beauty of the human form, there are plenty of gratuitous moments of shirtlessness by every main male character and yes by the powers of television, they are all buffed and bronzed and will make you self conscious that you don't have that V-line.  The only storyline that kind of bugs me is actually one of the main ones, the one between &#34;Scott&#34; and &#34;Allison&#34; and their blah blah blah romance that can't be because of his werewolfyness and her werewolfkiller-familyness.  At first their courtship is cutesy and what you would expect from high schoolers but it seems to just drag on and on and on as the Season one episodes continued.  I knew in my head that Season 2 would be more of the same which made me want to drive a hammer through my skull.  The dialogue between the two characters is so mind numbing and it seems they slow the storylines down a lot just to focus on their relations.<br />  As far as the DVDs go, its a must purchase.  Season 1 is very inexpensive and comes loaded with cool extras including commentaries (yes I watch those) and featurettes.  I enjoyed the DVD mocking the overly shirtless male leads in a special feature that highlight all the great shirtless moments.  Another great thing about this show is its open acceptance of homosexuality and its embrace to a gay male character that is best friends of team captain Jackson.  The show keeps up with the general beat of continuing acceptance of gay individuals and (though might be unrealistic) really respects the subject and has moments of fun with it.  If you love this show, this DVD is a must have for your collection.  Give the show a chance, if you are like me I know you will be reluctant, but I guarantee a few of you will end up loving it like I did.t enjoy the beauty of the human form, there are plenty of gratuitous moments of shirtlessness by every main male character and yes by the powers of television, they are all buffed and bronzed and will make you self conscious that you don't have that V-line.

B0096BIENY|5.0|Il Divo, is incomparable.  They're precise harmony, beautiful tonal quality and magical styling make this a wonderful CD.  Plus, their selection of songs is perfect for this group - they have a special chemistry that makes everything perfect.  Great  S/H; arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  Great value for the buck.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Wonderful music. Great for background tunes. Wish I'd heard some of Marks music before and I entend to try more of his work soon. He was great in Dire Strait's but even better on his own.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Great idea - and to use all those great musical performers (mostly in their dotage?!) in an expanded cast was a total success.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|COULD BE AWESOME if cash purchases weren't necessary to advance quicker. This game is very addicting but slow to progress if you don't make purchases. I usually open the game, check the tasks, make sure all my workers are working and I leave the game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My sister Anne recommended this. It is a must for anyone who works with kids or simply loves kids. Thank you Anne for recommending it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Does not have what anyone would call Tips. and the Kindle Fire cannot download Candy Crush Saga. I can't even play Candy Crush on the Kindle Fire HD.
B005M4EM5S|5.0|Great book. The two performers doing the readings, both did a great job. However some of their pronounciations weren't consistent.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book is excellent for a fun, quick and easy reading. It's entertaining, the characters are easy to identify and care for, and its really fun.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the way the author makes geek mythology entertaining, and the way he presents each god and mythological creature helps readers understand their history but also identify them as things or people that could exist in the present.<br /><br />I'm already reading the third book of the collection, so I can assure you it's pretty good.<br /><br />Excellent for kids who want to read a more serious but easy-going book.
1609611543|5.0|This book is very much an education in what has been done to our wheat supply and the toxic affects it has on our bodies. This is one of our best purchases. Both of us have already had noticeable, positive health changes. We also have had weight loss without exercise as we have been traveling. We both have not had the huge appetites like we did prior to following this way of life. We should be having lab work done soon so will see how that turns out. I am sure that all will have improved numbers. Dr. Davis does an excellent job of explaining everything so that everyone can understand. He lives this way too. The also is a blog to follow.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I just love all 3 movies on DVD's and now on Blue Ray.I would recommended this movies to anyone who has noe seen them.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Just seemed a bit contrived-predictable sub and main plot.<br />Interesting idea, but has been done in various ways many times over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining for both the kids and myself. If you like minion's you will enjoy this game.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|We did not like because it seemed boring and too fragmented.  The movie was a disappointment for every one here.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as there were a lot of unexpected twists to the story.  But, I must say, that paint psychiatrists in a pretty bad light.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|Great book with tons of great information on running injury free.  Definately takes practice, but it is well worth it.
B0054NRC6S|5.0|This movie inspires a leader to reclaim his or her life after the lie of greed and selfish desire has been exposed
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This is way better then spending another $60 for the new power cable. I hate that they changed the plug but at least they didn't make the old ones not compatible.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I have never written a review, but I had to for this. I was actually scared to even read this book in fear that it was as disappointing as some of the reviews claimed. I was so happy to find out this book was the opposite of disappointing. This was a wonderful book and I don't understand all the incredibly negative comments about it. All three books were beautifully written and had such vivid imagery and characters. I also truly liked the ending and was only sad that it was over. This is a must read! She is a great author and I can't wait to check out her other books now.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author brings you back to a place and time that we are totally detached from, separated by time and events that we don't learn in school, yet are sure to be true.  She has a special gift for illuminating the life of this young girl while also portraying her not as the quintessential protagonist, but flawed as well.  The story brings the reader in and envelops them while the characters lives takes turns that are unexpectedly surprising.  Great read!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like it because you can play with a friend and buy different pony! Any girl could buy this! Try this game today!
140006922X|3.0|As an atheist, I always found it quite remarkable that Hanukkah and Christmas are  celebrated at the same time of year.<br /><br />One is the holiday commemorating liberation of Land of Israel from foreign invaders and re-establishment of Jewish nation-state.  Another is the holiday commemorating  birth of one of Jewish nationalist leaders.<br /><br />For me, this book was not a revelation, but a well-researched confirmation of my views.<br /><br />Positives:<br />Reza Aslan did a great job of deconstructing the historical Jesus and his life in the first-century Roman province of Judea. I also liked his overview of Church politics and fighting among apostles after Jesus' crucifixion.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />I take stars for some historical inaccuracies.  For example, Reza Aslan did not mention that Rome was humiliated by Jewish rebels after the revolt started in 67 CE when they defeated Roman army led by Cestius Gallus in the battle of Beth Horon.  His statement that Rome just returned to re-conquer Judea in 70 CE is not fully accurate.<br />Another star is taken because Mr. Aslan extensively uses the term \\"first-century Palestine\\" without mentioning that the area started to be called \\"Palestine\\" only in the second century.  I guess, leopard can't change its spots...<br /><br />Finally, I think I understand why many Christians are upset at the author \\"who happens to be Muslim\\" as his book essentially destroys their god.  I can hardly wait for Mr. Aslan writing a similar book on Prophet Muhammad.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book had my mind going crazy with imagination, I loved it so very much and will read it again!!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is such a wonderfully done movie, and not as twee as most yuletide movies that have children in them.  Wouldn't recast a single role.
B00A83075M|5.0|a good animation film, that even people that doesn't know anything about video games should definitly try ! Those are not entirely familiar with games would only miss a couple jokes.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|This is a well acted and well set up action movie and well for the price to pick it up. A reimagioning movie like Jack the Giant killer and Van Hellsing.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is Nesbos' first Harry Hole story.  It was interesting in that it set up his back story, but the writing was not as good as it becomes in his later stories.  It becomes tighter and gives more information.  I liked the book but only in that respect.
B006P0FICE|5.0|Well set up good acting, nice additional things thrown at you to make a fresh feal to this movie, all in all well worth it to buy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very good game at a low price. would recommend for all ages over three or four. helps with logic and problem solving yet entertaining at the same time.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Small, lightweight and functional. I bought it to put in my hunting pack and to have to keep a good edge on my hunting and skinning knives. I have used it to sharpen knives around the house and so far it works good. Not the sharpest edge ever, but still enough to do anything you'll need for a normal knife.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Immediately pulls you into the story. Seamlessly  shifts from adult to child to adult perspective. Incredibly potent imagination -- loved it.
B001EBWING|5.0|The first time I saw this movie in college I knew it would be the start of a beautiful friendship! :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Ok this is a fun game but it take 5 hours to load it says I have it loaded but it not  but when it did load it was awesome I give it a 8 out of 10
B000OLRH10|5.0|Loved the movie, Leonardo Di Caprio acting was super.  The plot about the diamonds opened my eyes.  I give it 5 Stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addictive !! Keeps you on your toes trying to break out of the rooms cleverly done. Highly recommended.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I tried the free app.. love the is actually hard..makes u think ..can be for kids and adults...worth the money because it has srveral levels..each with different challenges
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very interesting book detailing how Nikola Tesla impacted (and invented) many products that changed the world.  The book piques my interest in learning more about this extraordinary man.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius continues to deliver in his new country genre!  One of the best singer song writers out there of any music genre.  He sings form the heart and his voice resonates!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince always hits the high notes.  Love his music and his arrangements but here he's doing some old stuff that you are familiar with from other artists.  It's great.
1936891026|5.0|Pressman does an effective job of presenting the impediments to achieving any goal, creative or otherwise, by identifying the culprit of &#34;resistance.&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun to play take up time when you have nothing to do.  my grandson Also enjoy play it.  just needs a little more speed.
1936719010|5.0|This was my second Pressman book.  Some is repetitive of The War of Art but I still found it effective in communicating how to think about &#34;resistance&#34; to acting to achieve goals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Coolest game ever I just love this game so much but I just can't save the last game so that's just a cool game yo play
B0046B3QTG|5.0|It was not what I expected. It was a good family movie.<br />The good in human nature triumphed over evil!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The writers, producers and actors of NCIS really work together to bring a quality product.  A viewer can always tell if some actor does not like a particular scene.  It happens rarely in Season 10; however, I could tell that Cote was not particular happy with her part and I guessed that she might move on to something different.  Kote will be missed but the core cast remains the same which is good.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|An action movie with enough comedy relief to make it enjoyable.<br />It had enough comic relief even my wife could watch it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|As close to WoW as it gets. The PvP<br /> leaves something to be desired, but the game rocks! Play Order and Chaos.
B008R5WAJ4|4.0|I can't give this 4-1/2 stars... it isn't a PERFECT album, but wow do I really really like it. I first heard Soha on Pandora and came running from the other room screaming, &#34;OMG who is that lovely voice!?&#34; Not every track is a home run--the first two are my favorites--but this is a refreshing alternative to the auto-tuned bimbos and earnest emos with guitars.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is quite challenging when you get to upper levels, at least for me... maybe I just don't have the mental eye for it.  :)  Enjoy!!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Specially math puzzles. So this was a must have for me. Got it during the free daily app thing in the Amazon App Store.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie inches along at just the right pace, with enough build up to get emotionally invested in the characters (both from Dufresne and, for example, the prison librarian). Thought provoking, inspirational, feel-good movie. I definitely recommend watching this movie if you've never seen it before. A great addition to any film collection.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|This is a great book to carry around to fill in those few blank moments required of everyone to wait. Airport, doctor's office, child's music lesson. Easy to pick up where you left off and the rhythm of the writing is in sync immediately. Moving on to book three.
B00005YU1O|5.0|A visually entertaining drama about a man caught in a dream. Excellent writing helps the lectures really come to life. Thankfully Ethan Hawke does not have a very large role in this movie. A very different side of the actors who starred in Dazed and Confused.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A delightful insight into why we do what we do. Inspired me to look at my life and change things around for more positive outcomes.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|For being free through Amazon, I should give this book 5 stars. It was absolutely hilarious at some points & there was a cute love story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It took me a few hours but it was a blast it was fun and I think I'll do it again I hope for a number two # the room 2  Yes HONEY!
B00B7ERH04|4.0|She seems to really enjoy using this...It is extremely easy to navigate and fun to use all in the same setting.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A classic coming of age movie, excellent acting and just all out superb.. would definitely recommend to any of you
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Few albums are good all around. Each song has it's own unique taste. I strongly recommend if you have enjoyed their other singles.
B000ICXQF6|4.0|Great movie and great acting. It's one of those movies that stood the test of time. Great story, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it,
B002CIY8EM|3.0|I read it because I thought I should have years ago. It Is too wordy. I am interested in the subject , but I have found other authors who present the subject betteer.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Fun to play with God<br /><br />Melissazurkuhlen and I am a good Yahoo is the couch and eve in the couch watch it is a while to make robins the test of fish oil companies that have a little too many times I have to do it Bullitt theCandidiasis and ski resorts are not be proud that you like utube
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I only hope Connally keeps us with good reading. He has a perfect record with his past publications. I will buy the next one.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is one of the best in the series.<br />I love the whole collection and I hope others will too.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Always been a fan of Dexter, and this season was as good as any other. One of the best shows ever.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I watched this movie on cable before buying the DVD here. I had no idea the DVD version was going to be missing critical character building sequences that make the story much more enjoyable. After watching the complete, long version this shortened version is ruined for my wife and I. There is so much that is missing that we spent the whole viewing time pointing out the missing scenes. Very disappointing!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is a light and way read. It has a great plot line and is a very sentimental story! I wouldn't necessarily consider it a challenge read, but it is something that keeps you turning pages! I would recommend it for the teen to young adult range and probably no older.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I have had wade for just a few days. I have enjoyed using it and learning all of its many uses. I travel about 4-6 Times a year. I Will recommend it to friends and family.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|See edit at bottom regarding update.<br /><br />Just got it yesterday and couldn't wait to try it out.<br /><br />I have an Insight TV with a MHL and a standard HDMI port. I tried it in the MHL port first since I had heard it might be able to draw power from it but it did not power up. I then plugged it into a 3 to 1 HDMI cable I use [[ASIN:B00B46XUQU Portta PET0301S 3x1 HDMI Switcher Support 3D]] to plug in my PC, Kindle HD, and Raspberry Pi hackboard. Plugged the USB cable that came with the Chromecast into a powered USB hub [[ASIN:B000Q8UAWY Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub]] I use with the Raspberry Pi, I'm a little gadget happy, the player fired up and the 3 to 1 automatically switched to it. The TV did not power on by itself, but when I turned it on and switched to that HDMI port it soon was displaying the startup screen.<br /><br />After that, setup was a breeze.<br /><br />Tried it with two computers, the computers, the TV with Chromecast, and the Wifi router were in the same room.<br /><br />First I tried with an older Win 7 laptop with a two core CPU and 4 GB ram. Hulu worked great, with none of the problems of catching up that I have read about in some reviews. It does run about half a second behind the pc, but I was able to leave it running while trying out doing other things on the PC and it worked with no problems. I could view it full screen and alt tab to a different window.<br /><br />Netflix works fine, and now that I can set up different profiles for different family members it is even better.<br /><br />Viewing Amazon videos did not work, which I had heard was the case, I understand it has to do with the Silverlight plug-in Chrome uses on Windows, imagine someone will come up with a workaround soon.<br /><br />Second I tried it on a netbook with an Atom CPU and 1 GB ram. Hulu was horrible. The image on the TV stayed static for seconds at a time and the sound was constantly cutting out. Netflix did not due any better. I think the Chrome browser is overwhelming the machine.<br /><br />Last I tried my Kindle. I was able to download a Chrome apk and get it running, but when I tried to install the Chromecast extension I was told that my device was not supported. I could not find anything in the App store that would work either.<br /><br />Worked great with my PC though and it is early days, I'll bet that there is a Kindle app in the works and a way will be found to cast Amazon videos from Windows. For $35 how can you go wrong!<br /><br />And if anybody at Amazon is listening, WE NEED A KINDLE COMCAST APP!!!<br /><br />EDIT:<br />When I wrote the previous, I was the only one home. Another family member came home later and fired up their laptop. The sound from the Hulu show I was watching started lagging, sometimes really badly. A quick pause would bring it back into sync, but after a little bit I gave up and plugged a HDMI cable directly into laptop. Our router is getting on in years, a more updated one might handle the increased traffic better. Am thinking of trying the laptop on a network cable, but that will be a pain.
1781162646|5.0|I love all Steven King books and Joyland is no exception.  I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I really enjoy playing this version.<br />Running on an ancient (2 year old) Kindle Fire, tends<br />to hang occasionally at the &quot;sdl&quot; opening screen,<br />which we shouldn't see at all.<br />So I uninstall it, then reinstall, and everything's<br />back to normal for another month or so. This is Not<br />a reason to shy away from the game, just a maintenance issue to he aware of when playing it exhaustively.
006178480X|4.0|James Rollins continues his streak of writing entertaining non-stop adventure novels with \\"The Eye of God.\\"  Featuring the Sigma Force, \\"The Eye of God\\" combines what Rollins does best: history, adventure, mystery, frenetic world traveling, and a tiny (and entirely appropriate and fitting - thank goodness it's not gratuitous) bit of romance.  Rollins's novels are known for being fast-paced, but \\"The Eye of God\\" is extremely fast-paced, even for Rollins.  I felt as if I had to stop and catch my breath every so often.  This novel included an interesting side plot concerning Seichan's search for her mother, a search that began in the book's prequel \\"Bloodline.\\"  It's nice to see Seichan continue her humanizing progression, so she's not presented as just a cold-blooded assassin.  The depth that her character is given in \\"The Eye of God\\" adds complexity and makes her more interesting.  In addition, Rollins dares to have MAJOR things happen to a couple of the recurring characters.  I won't include spoilers here; suffice it to say that regular Rollins readers will be shocked.<br /><br />As the timeline becomes shorter and the clock ticks down, the novel picks up speed, as if the book is on a roller coaster, and the last 50 pages are on the final downhill run.  Exciting, nail-biting, exhilarating!  The epilogue put an outstandingly creative twist to the novel.  Loved it.<br /><br />Rollins is adept at drawing scenes that are Hollywood big screen-worthy but not stereotypical.  Characters are not caricatures; although they have distinct personalities, they are not so one-dimensional as to be annoying.  Of course the reader has to suspend disbelief regarding the breakneck pace at which the Sigma team solves mysteries and stays one step ahead of its enemies, but that's part of the fun of reading a Rollins novel.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this a 5-star rating is that there was perhaps a little bit too much back and forth among the different threads in the novel, before they started coming together.  It's not such a big deal, but just enough of an issue to have me the slightest bit confused on occasion.  I had to glance at the time stamps of the chapters to make sure I understood what was going on.  Other than that, the novel was highly entertaining.  I look forward to Rollins's next Sigma Force novel!
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Suspense!<br /><br />An execution squad in the first chapter!  A plethora of colorful characters and a storyline with lots of twists and turns.<br /><br />A mysterious assassin that is in a class all his own. One of Forsyth's first novels, and I think it's his best.<br /><br />If you've seen the movies (1973, 1997), they they pale in comparison to the novel. It's a must read and reread.<br /><br />D. Lehmann
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|Collectors should note that this is a plastic statue, not an action figure.  It's a decent sculpt, although some paint flaws on the gun hand (the gun is fixed in the hand).  Those who want articulation should look elsewhere.  A good likeness of Bryan Cranston.
B00BX50UEC|5.0|Having grown up with the excitement of the competition of European music, I was really thrilled to be able to find this CD which gave me a recording of all the numbers.  Of course I was especially interested in the winner from Denmark - great song.
B004E547D8|5.0|Can't wait to see the sequel. All the stars were super, lots of action and funny at the same time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pro's: I like the diversity. It keeps my mind busy. The quests are interesting.<br /><br />Con's:  power expends to quickly.  I want more ways to acquirer diamonds.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It reminds me of Sim City but the ads to buy buy buy! are distracting.  You can not buy certain things or certain tasks without points that you have to buy.  I guess that's why the game is free.
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|Dislike the comic book aspect - not at all what I expected. Not a comic book reader, so didn't finish the &#34;book.&#34;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've only played the first four levels but this game is a lot of fun! It's challenging but not impossible. It's like a cross between 100 floors and any room escape u may have played. Very nicely done!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I really like this app. I would have given 5 stars, but for a tech challenged person like me it is a bit difficult to figure out how to make it work to its full potential. Sound effects are pretty cool!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie still makes me smile the way it did when I was 9.  It's timeless, and now I get to watch it with my kids.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Awesome, awesome book! I learned a lot reading this book & am going to read it again next month when I finish my current book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game to play horse looks real and keeps you entertained for hours good for all ages and great for horse lovers
140006922X|1.0|The information in this book is nothing more than what muslims have believed for over 1000 years. Not surprising when the author is just that, a devout muslim apologist.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enzo was different then most dogs he felt that when he died he would return in a human form and that his owner Denny<br /> Would know him. The book starts at the end of his life and then picks up to when he was chosen by Denny who loved to race cars and had the skill to race in the rain. The book is written as if Enzo is telling the story and Enzo is very frustrated by the fact that he couldn't speak, he felt that if he had a thinner and shorter tongue and thumbs he could communicate, all thru the book he talks about not having thumbs and a short tongue for he longs to get his point across. This is a must read for a dog lover, it will have you laughing out loud and some tears. Enzo plays a very important role with all the family members, the wife Eve and Denny's daughter Zoe. The book has become one of my favorites and I have already had three people read it. The author did a superb job writing this book and holding your attention, a very injoyable book that I read as an E-book and will be buying a hard copy to keep to share with others. Their is some bad language that I wish that had been left out but if you can get pass that you will be telling others that it is a must read. This book earns five stars easily!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun, and I don't even like video games!  everyone in my family loves it. it is very addicting.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Love this movie so much!! A great story, with just the right amount of spooky weirdness. Maybe a little bit scary for some children. I loved it as a kid though!
B00CMEQD30|5.0|This ebook is Hellenthal's first novel, and it shows real promise.  It tells the story of two strong women: Artride, Queen of Ceartas; and Tirsa, Commander of the Seventh Company.  Tirsa begs the Queen to spare the life of her young brother, who faces execution for having innocently violated one of the countless commandments of the Law Book.  But in Ceartas, the law is not merely harsh and unyielding; it is cursed.  Whether royalty or commoner, all are forced to obey, with no room for mercy or equity.<br /><br />In a desperate effort to save Tirsa's brother, the Queen and her Commander set off to find the Sorceress of Dochas, a beautiful and apparently immortal witch who may hold the key to breaking the curse.  Along their journey, Artride and Tirsa learn each other's secrets, and come to know one another as far more than merely lord and liege.<br /><br />The Queen's Curse is a captivating fantasy with some beautiful imagery.  In a lyrical style, Hellenthal focuses upon her main characters, and takes her time in allowing their lesbian relationship to develop. As with many ebooks, parts of the novel could have benefited from tighter editing, but it is an interesting tale, and I look forward to reading her future work.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Love this movie! It's so beautifully shot. Great story and so beautiful to watch. I didn't find it particularly scary, but there are a few good gore scenes!

B0010T75W6|5.0|A must see for LGBT people and their friends. It's funny, sad, and heart-warming. The music is great too.  \\"Wicked Little Town\\" is so well done.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and I will definitely be reading more. Very easy to read, yet still quite intellectual in its wording. Overall a great story about two teens with cancer who fall in love. It sounds depressing, and I guess it was in a way, but it was also uplifting. Highly recommended
B007REV4YI|1.0|I thought I knew something of the 007 stories, but this was too far out for me.  Lots of special effects, but if there is a plot , I missed it.

B0031TZ8TU|4.0|Another fast pace novel.  Difficult to put down.  Enjoyed every moment. Ken Follett is brillant and knowledgeable. Would recommend it to all his readers and new comers.

B00475AYJQ|3.0|Overall, I like this book. It felt weird to criticize it, but most have nothing but positive things to say.<br /><br />And with good reason - Rothfuss writes his cultures and world mechanics superbly. Every town felt distinct, every culture felt different, every facet of magic or the amazing read well and was well thought out. Rothfuss recycles nothing in these areas, and frankly he could have created several worlds or stories with the wealth of imagination he invested in this story.<br /><br />That being said, he can't write a sympathetic villain to save his life. Without giving spoilers, everyone who has even the most passive disinterest in providing conflict to his protagonist is one dimensional. If they had shifty eyes and twirled a mustache, I could not have formed a lower opinion. From the streets of Tarbean to the University, to the lands beyond, everyone he comes across that is going to give him trouble is just a douchebag that you could not possibly invest any care or emotion in. Even their villainy becomes recycled and boring. I've seen bad villains that at least gave a laugh, but the antagonists in this story are flat and boring.<br /><br />Also, the way I outline my poor opinion of the villains (writing it differently several times) is another mark against Rothfuss. It feels as though he does not trust his reader to understand his points at times, and thus provides his protagonist a chance to explain them. And then another person in the scene to also explain it, slightly different. And then the person having it explained to them (who may as well represent the reader at this point) will explain it back, also differently. And then in some cases, someone will explain it again a fourth time. This is ok in some cases, and I think everyone has had a moment in their lifetime of reading where they wished something was explained in more detail, but Rothfuss does it with nearly everything from the fantastic to the mundane. It is grating.<br /><br />Finally the women. From the first book, Rothfuss has a frustratingly 15 year old concept and approach to writing about sex, lust, love, and women in general. Then book two comes along and without providing spoilers, suffice to say his view of sex is binary - you are a lustful tavern wench who applies little to no value to sex, or you are an uber conservative man/woman who blushes at its merest suggestion. In some cases, this is warranted by the particular individual or scene, but there's zero shading to this in Rothfuss's writing - there is no spectrum whatsoever. I'll go ahead and add here that his women are frustrating when approaching anything feminine. If they are doing something masculine or neutral, there is nothing odd to their manner at all - they're as well done as the majority of his characters. But add anything even remotely consigned to the realm of femininity, and it will grate on you. Or at least it did to me.<br /><br />Finally, I'll just go ahead and gripe (this one may purely be me), but I found Bast incredibly frustrating. Ever watch a movie where the hero needs to scream \\"I love you!\\" or \\"I'm angry!\\" or \\"I hate you!\\" (hi George Lucas)??? Rothfuss appears to have moments where I can imagine he was tired after writing a particularly involved chapter where it concludes with a point that is important to the reader, but not evident at the time, and rather than painstakingly reveal this fact, he'll simply allow Bast to interrupt and scream at the reader how important the fact was. Or how dangerously committed he is to his goals. Or how sad he is for the protagonist. It is tiresome, and becomes predictable. All of those things are somewhat forgivable, but given the way the book is written, it pulls you out of any immersion Rothfuss has weaved until that point and feels rather like a splash of cold water on the face. I found them to be forced breaks for myself as well as Chronicler.<br /><br />Again - I like this book. But there are hundreds of reviews here to provide you with people gushing over the amazing aspects of Rothfuss's writing, and many of them are well written. I felt it worthwhile to point out this author has a lot of promise, but it would be unfair to his potential to ignore these jarring flaws, at least in my opinion.ou with people gushing over the amazing aspects of Rothfuss's writing, and many of them are well written.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have read all of the past Game of thrones books and it took me a little longer to really get into this book. It picked up about half way through. At the end George R. R. Martin explains that the book was originally twice the size so he separated the book by characters. As a result characters like Tyrion, Dany, Jon, and others are not mentioned in this book. The pace of this book just seemed slower than the last. There are some exciting and major story lines that happen near the end. There are new characters to get use to. Overall it was a good read and I am looking forward to number 5.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I still don't understand why we have to PAY for an app to access our camera. I think that is a scam. I personally like the updated version of this app. There is much more to do on it.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This is by far the best player I've tried on my kindle fire tablet.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good player.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Nice game.  Puzzles are hard enough to work through, easy enough to not give up..Hint option if you get stuck.  Overall, I enjoyed this game...<br />There are some drawbacks, however.  If you run out of time, you have to redo the entire level...Some themes were just impossible to guess at, more info is needed.  These scenes are what I utilized hints for used a skip globe.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book kept my imagination going.  The characters took form in my mind as the author described each one.  Good read!
1439153663|3.0|Somewhat predictable, unimaginative first person narrative.  Characters are colorful and engaging (the black characters), but overall not a compelling read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Good book....I really can not wait for the next Ken Follett.  Very interesting and always excited to read Folletts books.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book bounced around at first and was a little hard to follow but once I put it together (about mid way thru) the story line was great and I was hooked.  But the way it ended was just stupid and left me wondering........actually it made me mad.  But it was a good read...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just too good to be true! Even though it seems to be a stretch, Christian is awesome, and the way he's proving his love for Ana is incredible! I love romance mixed with suspense! On to the next book immediately!
B003B02O3C|5.0|This book is engaging, to say the least. The character's emotions are all over the place as he find his \\"role\\" in life. But remember, if you pick it up, you won't put it down until you read cover to cover.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Mr Landay is a most intelligent writer. His style develops with twists and turns that fascinate and surprise the reader. Defending Jacob is no ordinary court drama although the legal plot is crisp and real. Most importantly the human aspect of the story is compelling, raw and tender at the same time. Bravo!
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I purchased this case because I like the idea of the rotate feature.  It was hard to rotate when I first used it but a little WD40 did the trick.  It turns now with no problem.  It does not have a magnetic closure so it doesn't close completely without assistance with the elastic strap.  However It does close enough the turn the screen off when not in use.  It is of sturdy construction and appears it will hold up well depending on the amount of use of course.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Touched on soo many things i grew up to.  Story for start to finish was amazing.  I couldn't stop reading it. My new favorite book.

B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Well this one is not the greatest movie from the collection but it has a nice action plot. All thought not the top choice from all the Die Hard movies. I bought this just to keep the Die Hard collection up to date.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun game. Lots of action to keep you busy. Can' wait to play it again agin and again. Wow
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|It has a great actors and it is really great comedy/action movie. I hope that with RED 2 they will keep it in the same mood.
0142410705|5.0|This one may be my favorite John Green book so far. (Yes, I said it, not The Fault In Our Stars. Heresy, I know, right?!  Ok, maybe they tie for favorite.) A little on the quirky side, but that's part of its charm.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric Burdon has made an exteremely palatable album this time around.  Every song is well written and produced and his voice is still as strong as the early Animals.  What amazed me most was the diversity of the songs without jeapardizing his commitment to offered a broad scope of music topics. Top notch musicians back this great effort up.
055338466X|4.0|Wide ranging topics explored by the physicist combo, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.  Looking at material world from a quantum perspective, author claims there is no free will (p. 32), though free will is likely more a process than a physiological response to some stimuli.  What author describes in this section is the how and not the why or what; therefore free will is more an extension of human reason or the why of one's action or non-action. One of the more interesting though highly speculative topics is multiple universes under \\"The Apparent Miracle\\" chapter.  The upshot is that if there is a random process underpinning all, i.e., all generative processes, then universes come and go; though lucky for us ours is still here! In the last chapter, authors contradict their \\"philosophy is dead\\" statement in the first chapter, by posing philosophical questions: Why! Why! Why!  Certainly the sciences have eclipsed previously explanatory disciplines - e.g., theology - though authors fail to convince and barely substantiate that physics will be able to get us beyond the hows to the whys of existence.  Maybe this really is the \\"mother\\" of all mysteries.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|This movie features the talented Mr. Pattinson - always a plus. But the movie itself is rock solid. Lots of sex, some violence, so not for the children. Interesting story, well shot.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|Excellent graphics, levels get more challenging as you go. I really enjoy this type of game where you have to plan out the best routes. Sometimes those darn bunnies just don't listen though and plummet to their death! Lots of fun, especially after level 11 when it actually gets challenging.
B00340ESIS|2.0|The book is the author's view on the most basic storytelling techniques that have been around forever. In that, it's useful and informative, because you'll learn about things like the \\"hero's journey monomyth\\" in an easily digestible way. There is a distinct emphasis on the primal, basic, unconscious - those things that are recurring in storytelling throughout the ages. The bad guy needs to be really, really bad. The good guy needs to have a strong and primal motivation. The good guy should change. The bad guy shouldn't. And so on.<br /><br />So, yes, in a way, it's a short and readable primer on movie storytelling.<br /><br />But: there's a lot of misleading theories and sloppy thinking here, too. One such is the author's take on genres, which is so generic and random that most stories will fall in many genres at once. And although the author claims that he knows which film is which genre, he doesn't say a word about why he thinks that. Another gem is when Snyder suggests that Miss Congeniality (a Sandra Bullock Christmas movie) is a better script than Memento (which Snyder calls a 'gimmick') - and the final proof for him is that the box office gross of Miss Congeniality was higher than that of Memento.<br /><br />The biggest problem, though, considering the goal of the book, is that many parts of it are - in my mind - plain bad advice.<br /><br />I think that is best exemplified by the author's track record. Although Snyder apparently sold many scripts - for millions of dollars - to the studio executives in the 1990s, only two of them were ever made. One is Blank Check (IMDB score 4.7) and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (IMDB score 3.7, winner of the 1993 Razzie Award for the Worst Screenplay). Neither was a box office hit, by the way.<br /><br />If you want sound storytelling advice, I can't recommend [[ASIN:0984178627 Invisible Ink: A Practical Guide to Building Stories that Resonate]] enough.

B0043X1FL8|5.0|A tour de force for Robert De Niro. Done with much love and compassion for the afflicted. A story of the tragic losses some people suffered in the aftermath of a cruel disease (encephalitis) that robbed them of everything except life, and a young doctor who refuses to give up in his quest to rescue them from the clutches of this disease that turns them into statues. A story of hopes awakened and then lost once more. The young doctor's experimental treatment for encephalitis patients led to a current treatment for those with Parkinson's disease, although at the time of the film this was not yet known.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I give this cd 5 stars because there is not one bad song on it.  One Republic is Awesome.  Happy Camper here
B0012HEB32|5.0|This series was shaping up to be something REALLY good, but for some reason the network decided to axe it. I'm sure it was all about the ratings and not enough whatever, but I think it had a great start and was really progressing nicely. Oh well, I guess they needed to make room for more inane &#34;reality TV hook-up&#34; shows or something. I had hoped another network might pick it up and run with it, but that seems unlikely now given the amount of time that has passed. Now it has gone the way of Heroes, Flash Forward, The Event and so many others recently. What a shame...
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Previous reviewers are correct, put subtitles on so you know what's going on. Otherwise, I'm not sure what I expected from this movie. It is full of sweeping ideas, I'm not sure how the execution compares to the book. It was alright, not a movie I would want to one but perhaps one worth watching with a group of thoughtful people you could discuss it with afterwards.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am seriously addicted to this game. Its very entertaining &amp; the different areas of the run are cool. I love the minions

B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Hubby and I like the game but not really people into sharing it with friends.  Not on the computer that much!
0345803485|1.0|I have bought this book because my 19-year old daghter wanted to read it and I knew it was a bestseller. BESTSELLER? I could not believe it was ever published.<br /><br />The bottomline has some potential: a young innocent girl falling for a man who is handsome and rich but has dark past and is heavily into BDSM sex.<br /><br />The rest is so terrible that I thought it was a practical joke - just to see how much the public can take. And sadly it turns out we can take a lot!<br /><br />There is no plot at all. The female character, Ana, is a 21 year old virgin who never fell in love in her life. 21 year old and no crush in her life?!  The male character, Christian Grey, is a 27-year old billionaire (yeah, why not?) and a major sponsor of her university. Aparently, before meeting him, and she had no idea who he was. No surprise though, because graduating from a college in 2011 she did not even have an e-mail addres (untill, of course, he gave her a computer). A student without an e-mail address is a nonsense, even an ET is more believable. The story reads like Ana came from some cave and bumped into a billionaire with BDSM tendencies, and sudenly he is mad about her. Ok, they meet, they `murmur', they `gasp', they have sex at his place, then in one hotel, then in another hotel. Occasionally they also fly airplanes and helicopters (of course, he flies all these machines - what did you think??).<br /><br />Most of conversations go like this.<br />***<br />Christian: `Stop biting your lip, you know what it does to me. And eat your food.'<br />Ana is thinking: `Holy crap. I did not notice that I was biting my lip. And I am not hungry.'<br />***<br />And I am not kidding, I have personally read these or similar lines at least 20 times.<br /><br />Ana is an English literature major but her language is below any bar. If you remove `Oh my', `Holy cow-Moses-s***-crap- etc.', `Jeez' and the like, the book will become shorter by 10-20 pages - a very common page limit for a greatscientific paper.<br /><br />Some people say they could not put the book down. I personally struggled through it. I just hoped I would get why it became so popular. And I did not. I cannot understand how the text of such low quality could be published, let along being a bestseller?! And what the movie will be about - 1,5 hour of Ana biting her lip and looking for her hair tie, and having orgasm every 5 minutes?<br /><br />I feel betrayed by the author and the publisher. They made no effort at all to make the story deep or at least believable, or readable. What does the Grey's company do? He employs 80,000 people, how does he find the time for all this sex, texting, e-mails? Why do I need to read so many times that Christiam `runs his long fingers through his hair?' What does it add to the story? It is just another empty line to fill up 500 pages of - well - holy crap.<br /><br />Two things I did after finishing the text: 1) Texted to my daughter that I will tell her what happened, she does not need to suffer actually reading it. 2) Treated myself by going to Amazon and reading the one-star reviews. These were so good, and funny, and so much better than the book! Thank you, guys! I just want to add my vote to the promising one-star count.

B00DGMVJAO|4.0|If there is something that films are missing in today's world, it is a sense of ADVENTURE. That feeling you felt as a kid after you watched The Lone Ranger or Zorro on television, or Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Lord of the Rings. Those are the kinds of movies that make you want to go out and do something heroic and daring.<br /><br />Jack the Giant Slayer, for the briefest of moments, captured that adventure.<br /><br />A pity, then, that it's screenplay was poor, it's dialogue was clunky, and that it was overloaded with CGI, though, admittedly, it was good CGI. Let me list some cons. The screenplay is filled with plot holes, from melting down a giant's heart to make a crown, to the incredibly short time it took Jack, Elmont, and company to climb the beanstalk. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural, though the one-liners are suitably heroic (I loved Eddie Marsan's line \\"Choke on my bones!\\"). There is a Deux ex Machina so implausible it almost ruins the movie. Bryan Singer, an indisputably great director -- if only for the brilliant [[ASIN:B00101ZOTA The Usual Suspects]], shows a peculiar lack of restraint here. There is so much CGI on display here it makes The Hobbit and Man of Steel look almost subtle.<br /><br />Admittedly, the giant's animation and rendering _was_ very good. They were so hideous and disturbing you could almost smell them. But too much of a good thing is not wonderful. It is childish. And Jack the Giant Slayer is a very childish movie. Other cons include a sag in pace towards the middle of the film, and just way too many bodily humour/gross out gags, courtesy of the hideous giants.<br /><br />But hey, who says childish is bad? This is a movie based off of a magic children's fairy tale. I wasn't expecting the next Lord of the Rings here! Jack the Giant Slayer is entertaining in it's own right.<br /><br />First off, I was very impressed by the cast. Nicholas Hoult is perfect as the brave farmboy turned hero, adeptly mastering the awkward bravery and charm of Jack. Eleanor Tomlinson wasn't bad either, but her character lacked depth, foregoing a personality for lots of screams during action scenes. Stanley Tucci, on the other hand, is so deliciously evil you could almost sense him twirling his moustache offscreen. Can you say SCENE STEALER? This is another case of a good actor saving a thin story. As a worthy foe to Tucci's treacherous Rodrigo, we have Ewan MacGregor's brave and noble Sir Elmont, who gets most of the best scenes and heroic oneliners. Ian McShane is typically excellent, lending gravitas to his dodgy lines. The biggest surprise for me was Eddie Marsan, who, in his short role, became the coolest guy in the film. I would never have pictured Marsan as an action-hero, but by George is he believable!<br /><br />And let's not forget Bill Nighy. Nighy is one of the most diverse, distinct, adaptable, and entertaining actors working today. No matter what the quality of the film, you can count on Nighy to turn in a memorable and entertaining performance. He is typically on par as the evil, two-headed giant Fallon.<br /><br />Second, I was VERY impressed by the costume and set design. Everywhere you look, there is a beautiful, rich, believable, practical, stunning costume, from Jack's muddied leather clothes to the rich golden robes of the King. There was clearly a lot of work put into designing the giants, as each looks distinct and suitable hideous. Their armour, crude but effective, looks believable and realistic. The scenes that take place on Terra Firma are excellently shot. The medieval towns, castles, villages, and camps are all an effective blend of fanciful and realistic.<br /><br />Third, though there is too much of it, the CGI is still excellent. The giant's are incredibly realized, so finely detailed you can see the pores on their skin, the hairs in their nose, and the little latch that holds their breastplate together. This \\"unrealistic realism\\" gives the grand battle scenes more effective, as the giants become all the more menacing in our eyes.<br /><br />That brings us to the climactic battle scene. It was perhaps the high point of the movie; epic, dangerous, explosive, riveting, and fast-paced. The giants were evil and threatening, and the humans were relateable and suitably awesome. Refreshingly, it took place in daylight, and was not soaked in lightning and rain like so many other movies. Let me just say that, while it won't rank in the Top 10 battles anywhere, it was a very fun, effects heavy, completely OTT set piece.<br /><br />...<br /><br />In conclusion, Jack the Giant Slayer isn't perfect. It's marketing was poor and therefore, it didn't connect at the box office. Critics slammed it for being predictable, cliched, overloaded with special effects, and childish. Valid points all. But all that criticism was perhaps uncalled for.<br /><br />Jack the Giant is a fairy tale. It's got the requisite farmboy/hero, princess, gallant knight, evil advisor, and giants that make a fairy tale. Like a fairy tale, we've heard and seen it all before and many of us have grown out of it. But like a fairy tale, Jack the Giant Slayer is beautiful to look at, and the action is the sort of stuff that giants, knights, and a 150 million dollar budget was made for. It even touches us at the heart, sometimes. Other pros include great CGI and a noble cast! The production design is excellent, and John Ottman's score ain't half bad.<br /><br />So, yeah, it's not perfect. But let yourself go ride with Jack, slay giants, rescue princesses, and have a giant of a time. Four Stars.ive, as the giants become all the more menacing in our eyes.<br /><br />That brings us to the climactic battle scene.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|What can I say? I love this movie so I decided to buy it. I am happy with my purchase (:
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|As with the video game which this soundtrack is derived from, it's haunting and beautiful all at the same time. Each track paints it's own depiction of the horrors of the world where each of the character lives. Unlike many modern video game soundtracks, minimalism is the key to this soundtracks greatness providing some of the best tracks without any backing of orchestras but simply an acoustic guitar.<br />Great soundtrack that will please fans of the game as well as tease those unable or haven't yet experienced the brilliant video game.
B006VRRGNK|5.0|I am and always will be a horror fan and since the days of Boris Karloff and his Mummy pictures all movies of the mummy are in my horror movie collection.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was on 1 day ago and it was listed for its MRSP of $35 now its up to $60+ go over to goggle play and buy it for the actual selling price. Not cool.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is one of the better games I have played.  It makes you think and cannot be finished in five minutes. If you like real challenge you will love this game..
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Like everyone in the free world I have heard Safe and Sound and thought wow what a great song.  So I bought the EP and thought this is a great EP can not wait for the album and than like an early Christmas In a Tidal Wave of Mystery was released.  This is a great album from song one (Safe and Sound) to track 12 (Love Away).  Standouts are Kangroo Court and Sold My Bed But Not My Stero.  If you would have told me a band would have two lead singers I would have laughed but Capital Cities does and they really compliment each other.  In additon the horn section is really solid.  A great cd by a great band.<br /><br />Ps if you have the chance to see them live you will not be disappointed they do some great covers.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The character development and plot drew me in with the first book, Hounded. I can't wait to get to the second book in the series.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guys Rhythm & Blues is a great CD with something for everybody to enjoy from Traditional Blues,Rock, R&B, Ballads, and great Guitar Solos by Buddy Guy. If you like Buddy Guy this is a must have to add to your collection.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this game is awesome and a good time killer! totally get it. fun can be challenging. total brain teaser
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again he has written an intellectual, insightful, and at times profound book.  Wonderful, wonderful story teller.  I think it is one of those books that one can read again and derive something more from it.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|Someone said that the miracle isn't that something works spectacularly well, but that it works at all. That's the perspective that I took with this underwater player. My expectation was not that I'd be listening to iPod stereo quality sound while swimming, but that I'd be hearing music in a reasonably acceptable way. The speakers are conducting sound through your cheekbones and not sending the sound directly to your ears, so it's unrealistic to expect it to be super clear. Since you can't wear headphones while you're swimming, the method that this uses to conduct sound is pretty ingenuous, but it does create degradation in quality. The sound is a bit muffled, like that which would come through an old-style cassette player. If you expect to hear something crystal clear, you'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />In terms of installation and use, you need to get them charged first and be sure to follow the instructions in the manual (which is, unfortunately, hidden behind the plastic insert and not necessarily easy to find unless you take the box apart). The buttons do double duty for navigation/volume control and power/playing and you may not figure it out intuitively. Also, the player does take a long while to turn on relatively speaking. You have to hold down the play/pause button for several seconds. In the long run, I do wonder if that will degrade the receptiveness of the button.<br /><br />The main \\"problem\\" is that it sounds less clear when your head is not underwater. If you are a free-style swimmer and your head is moving into and out of the water, then this will cause the sound quality to waver with head movements. I didn't find this to be too big an issue, but I think that some people may find it intolerably inconsistent.<br /><br />I'm still generally pretty satisfied with these, but I think it's important to understand exactly what you are getting and you are not getting crystal clear sound during your swim.
0765325950|5.0|Having read all the previous works, I had to read this as well.<br />It was worth reading.  The wait to get all the books in the series was the only problem.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app for my kindle Fire.It has great color and I like the instant video selection. love this app for my kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this product is very good. especially when the line w battery sign cimes up or something else happens it automatically pauses the game so you can pick up where you left off. also the game has a lot of different places you can go and different characters to use and you can give them different clothes and they have special characters for each place you also can use keys to keep going if you die which us nice i love this app
B000HL2J0G|3.0|Interesting program, I had heard about it but never had seen it so I took this opportunity to watch it.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This app also shows in Google play store, while being bought here. So it wants to be updated there and shows in the list despite it not actually being there. Please change package name or something to fix this.<br />The same problem occurs with the angry birds seasons ad free version

B00002N9ER|4.0|Love these for holdling a maglight flashlight on the wall so it is never lost and always accessible.  I usually just need one to hold the flashlight, so the package of two stretches the value for my money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby is great. I feel as if I am part of Downtown Abby. I can't wait till next  season.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|This DVD was in really good condition. Played without any problems. Great deal for the money. Very funny action movie.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I try to keep up with the dolls, but there are so many so I can be pretty choosy when it comes to getting them. I'm glad I got Twyla. Honestly my favorite part was her bio info, mostly because she's the daughter of a 'scary' monster, but she enjoys giving people good dreams and not bad ones. Really shows how these dolls break away from their traditional \\"parent\\" stories.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Love the story of peterpan. This edition has great pict quality. Enjoyed it very much. The extras are very interesting.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|As always beautifully written, but I felt the story was a little scattered. Loved the first two books so I found this one a little disappointing
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book was just what I needed! I have recommended it to some friends. Pam Grout makes the metaphysical-abundance-inner happiness related material easy to read and enjoyable.
B000OPPSX0|5.0|it was everything I hoped it would be & it is a beautiful recording.<br />thank you very much Eleanor Guiton
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a good case for an iPhone 4S. It is easy to slip on and off for cleaning and does a decent job keeping dirt and dust from collecting between the phone and case.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This was an unexpectedly good for being a faotd. I have little musical ability and no matter how I throw things in there it manages to make a melody. When the beat is increased it makes some chirping but I suspect that is a limitation to the tiny speaker in my phone more than that of the app.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Not much I can add to the various reviews here other than another five stars. Whisky Ghost alone proves he's the best bluesman on the planet. Period.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|One of the best shows on TV EVER!  Enthralling, shocking and surprising.  A roller coaster ride that is addictive.  I cannot stop watching.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I was not aware of the extent of the corruption in the Food industry until I saw this documentary...this definitely encourages me to read Fast Food Nation and other similar books
B002VWNIAY|2.0|Grandson came over & determined that it was at fault so returned it for a refund. Wish that hadn't happened as that movie has our favorite line in it: Here's looking at you kid&#34;.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|I think, at this point in her career, that this is her best CD and I enjoyed it very much.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Stands the test of time. I have to stop down and watch it anytime it is on TV. Must see movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|But... I would like more info on the benefits of the different structures and how they relate to environment Money etc...  expansion cards are slow to get.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I swear, from the moment I read that first page I was hooked. It was crammed with excitement and it always made me excited to see what happened next. Great from beginning to end. I'd say, best book in the series!
B000HZD168|4.0|Action is good acting good remember it was made many years ago.  However,  if you've  seen the more recent &#34;Into Darkness&#34;  you may want to watch this alternate time line!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game greater good day regardless of the other hand cuffs he was like a good heart of the lights outta your life together I'll be there at all let me find out what you want to be a good day
B001I45UFC|4.0|How do you come up with this? Enter a closet and you are in a new land... Found that have you in for tea.  MARVELOUS.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addictive the whole family can play think logically then forget it we've been challenging each other need more rooms don't know what to do now.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case does what I need it to do.  The only issue I see is that when you set it on the stand, there is little to hold it up.  The slot that the front cover fits into when you are setting up the stand is jus a bit too small.  It does work though, so it's not bad.  I rarely use the stand so it's not really that much of an issue and after you get the hang of it, it does work.  I would buy it again.  I do like the elastic that holds the cover back while in use or keeps it closed when not in use.  It is not bulky and seems to protect the tablet well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game mix between temple run and subway surfers fun for kids keeps them busy for a long time
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I liked this app, but I just could not figure out how to get the designs I made onto my kindle as a wallpaper
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In this game I have collected a lot of coins and bought a lot of people and boards. I love the updates cause that means a new look and usually new limited items. Limited items are the items that only last for a while then go out of store eventually, I love collecting the limited items. Me and my friends on Facebook also compete to get the highest score. I think anyone should be able to play this game and at least have a little fun. Definitely should download this game especially if you like temple run.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|I only had this app for a couple of hours to difficult to get used to.  Defiantly geared to more computer savy participants.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|We were looking forward to adding this collection of DVDs to our current collection of movies. The quality of this set of DVDs is outstanding and worth every penny to purchase this set of DVDs. This collection is worth investing just like your collection of Harry Potter DVDs. This set of DVDs is very entertaining just like the Legal Weapon DVDs.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|It is very good recorded, is remastered, sound great, I, recomended to music lover and those who likes the Beatles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so fun I herd if you play on realms you could play with ten people in the world awsome
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I enjoy Kate Morton, but her other novels The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden are better. I found the narrator of this novel tedious and the story a little slow going. That said, I don't regret reading it and I did enjoy it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Personally as an 11 year old it is hard to find a fun but a little productive game-app that is to my liking. Which is why I love, love, love it! And the clues help me because I'm not so great at looking for stuff it's one of my favorite qualities of the game! :)
0307887448|5.0|This book is my favorite syfy book i have ever read it was impossible to put down once i started reading it.  I am not a syfy expert put this has got to be one of the best recently written...
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This ranks right up there with the someday to be released &#34;Wrecking Crew&#34; movie (which I saw at a fundraiser)  Great history, great remembrances....The love of music comes through from all involved
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Forget about your life and take a walk inside one of the most brilliant science fiction novels available on the market.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I just watched this movie OnDemand. I watched every Bond Movie made. And, this is not a Bond film, in the true tradition of Bond films. No cool gadgets. No cool car. No scantily clad leading lady with a double entendre name (Pussy Galore anyone?) No, wise cracks during action scenes. And, most importantly, no super rich, twisted villain looking to take over the world. So, if you are interested in watching a Bond film you will be disappointed because this is not it.<br />However, if you are looking to watch a pretty good action movie with some decent special effects and some unpredictable twists you may enjoy this dark movie. But, I am pretty sure Ian Fleming would not approve of this latest adaptation of his beloved character.<br /><br />As a Bond Movie 1 star. As an action movie 3 stars. Average = 2.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Forget about your life and take a walk inside one of the most brilliant science fiction novels available on the market.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|...Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;...<br />It seems to work well, and also has been pretty pretty accurate.  I DO wish that there was an easily-accessible legend with solid definitions for the symbols.  Maybe there is, and I just don't know where to find it.  Anyway, a good purchase, and I feel good about recommending it!  It's been alerting me to &#34;Coastal Flood&#34; & &#34;Flash Flood&#34; warnings&#34; for days... oh, and the warnings are correct!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was really fun. Usually with games like these, I can't get past many levels. However with this game, it was easy yet challenging. I highly recommend this :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The kids and I love it. It's very addicting. I don't like like that it sort of freezes when the WiFi is connected. Other than that it is great fun.
0312427999|5.0|Extremely well researched documented and referenced. I wish i had read it earliers b/c it is very informative of even current events.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super addictive and loads of fun. I especially like that there are always new challenges to try and multiple minions to earn.
030746363X|3.0|Very interesting but it's more for men than women. I was a little disappointed I thought it would have more info on the weight loss part
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I've been hooked on the CC for a year now and devoured all the books in order. This is the best so far. Great entertainment. Superb character development, a story line with twists and turns. Held my interest for hours of super reading.
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|Love this film a classic and cult movie that will be around for many years to come.The original gang movie.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|It was a turning point in this epic journey for Dexter. This season, seven, which I watched without a break in time<br />brought me to the next season of anticipation. Don't know if it's in production yet, but if it happens, and it looks as<br />though it MUST, it may be the final. Things are really getting hairy.
B001F0N0ZG|4.0|i love this movie.  it's not just about love but also about friendship.  there are a lot of laughs and tears.  only gripe: the sound on the amazon on-line copy of the movie is super frustrating.  you constantly have to turn it up and turn it down and... you get the idea.  sometimes a conversation went from ok to super loud, and not because they were yelling - it was like someone had a remote to my tv and kept turning things up and down.  so on the amazon copy, good movie, not so great sound.

0879309210|5.0|If you have even the slightest dexterity with hand tools, this book shows you how to perform basic repairs.  OR, you can follow the instructions and do very difficult chores around your guitar.  I have several guitars, both acoustic and electric, and the book has helped me adjust the string height, fix the frets on my bass, etc.  Well written and it has tons of pictures.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|amazing quality, timely arrival, just what i wanted! and so many special features! enjoyed those almost as much as the actual films themselves :)
B00004SZWD|5.0|Had this album in the 70's and missed hearing it so bought it in CD.<br />If you are a Stevie fan you will love this.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|His other books grabbed you in the beginning and kept you there.  This book seemed like the author couldn't decide on the focus and it never grabbed me.  When I was at the end I found myself going &#34;what&#34;.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I didn't read the book.  I didn't like the characters.  I didn't like the accents (except of course Jeremy Irons').  And I didn't like the end.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The suspense was great.  The story also made you think what would you do as a parent.  Could feel the struggle and identify with the family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I are big fans of the movie and of the game. Don't really play many video games but we love this one. Ages 4 to 40. Fun for all!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Even though the movie is a series of cut scenes from the game, my children absolutely love watching the Batman movie.  This is a great movie for any young super hero.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun and challenging. Extremely easy to get consumed by! Can't wait for more.<br />The hints were helpful but I didn't feel like they gave everything away. Still had to use your brain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played on my Kindle Fire. If you want a virtual horse this is a must have game.<br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />A. Gregerson
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|This video is fun to watch. So far I like the funny & mostly realistic freedom of this show. The cast is Qwerky & sexy.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Nodebeat is for the musically inclined or the novice giving a unique interface in producing synthesized percussion beats. Give it a try and you'll quickly realize there is more than meets the eye.<br /><br />I am surprised at Amazon doing a repeat FAOTD,  however and wonder if it's due to a generous marketing strategy by AffinityBlue or laziness and stinginess by Amazon.  f
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The first time I played a dungeon hunter was when I snagged the latest one, thinking from what I saw, to be my newest all-time fav kfhd game. I was sorely disappointed however, as I soon discovered that the game had poor gameplay compared to what I was used to. Firstly, the need for better weapons and gear was forced on me constantly, gold was hard to come by and I barely made it past three levels before it became so frustrating, that finally I uninstalled it. I can happily say that Dungeon Hunter 3 far surpasses its successor in everyway imaginable. Same premise, but more thought out. Gold is easier to acquire, weapons and gear aren't outrageously expensive, and the simple yet intense gameplay keeps me entertained. There are four types of champions to be: Warlord, Shaman, Trickster, and Mage. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but seeing as I'm mostly a melee person I chose the warlord. The controls are easy to get used to and the special attacks are awesome, not so much over the top, but creative. A couple hours later.............Playing on-and-off, but leveled up to 12 and completed 5 series with AA+ or above on all of them. Each series has three missions to complete of varying difficulty, which award you with gold and xp.  So, before I continue to bore you with my adventures, this game gets all 5 STARS, and you need to get. The only con I have is the long download time, the downside to nearly all gameloft games but I compensate by taking a trip to the library's wifi. Oh yea, and you can buy iap's and the like, but thankfully their not forced on you.<br /><br />P.S. The only gripes I have are: one- I wish the developers would make the mischievous trackers full lower torso instead of just the shins, and two- there is a glitch on every single arena where the last enemy doesn't appear and it is impossible to progress, requiring you to either fail or start over. You can see the enemy and there is the red arrow pointing his way but he disappears as soon as you getclose.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I am more and more reluctant to trust the &#34;NY Times Bestseller&#34; banner. I probably would not take another twelve dollar gamble on this author again...
B00008CMR6|5.0|One of my all time top five. Could not wait to open and play. Nice addition to our collection and priced well. Happy
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I heard some hype about this book and suggested it as the first read in my book club.  Others hadn't heard of it and weren't as enthusiastic about it.  After everyone started reading they immediately changed their attitudes about the book.  I loved it.  The characters are witty and intelligent beyond their years, making it easier for us in our 20's to get into a book in which the protagonists are teens.  Overall, highly recommend!
B00006AW2G|5.0|If you love hearing the original Gimme Shelter, this is the CD.  Better sound than the album, but so is every CD.<br />Mick's voice is young and strong, Monkey Man is an example.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|That's all I really have to say.  Once you've watched you'll understand why children and adults alike fall in love with the movie and, of course, the minions!
0439679958|5.0|I picked this book up when I was in 7th grade. I just needed a book to read for class never invented to get sucked in or become a Hugh fan from it. I'm out of high school and I decided to finish the series. I stopped at night rise because the others hadn't been release. Needless to say I picked it up and read in 7 hours. Of the course of 24 bourse or so. Couldn't  put it down. If you loved Harry potter. You'll love this book for sure too.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This work is simply mesmerizing. The story was well told and engaging. The visuals combined with the music is simply magic. Best couple of hours I have spent in a long time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it's great , it's the rush that gets to you , you just want to keep accomplishing more and more
B0061S0A64|5.0|Hey wasn't this already a free app, other than that really cool app, make sure to get it while its free
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game will keep you amused for hours. It's so fun and amusing the little minions do funny faces and act just like they do in the movies.
B000000XB9|5.0|I grew up listening to Credence Clearwater Revival and the music doesn't get much better than this!  Fun to cruise and listen to.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It's a good book it talks about people standing up for each other I had to read it for school but I would definitely read it again
B000P407K4|4.0|This is a great comedy one I can watch over and over. George C. Scott is hilarious and a joy to watch. Peter Sellers is just fantastic as the President, Group Captain Leonel Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove. Sterling Hyden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens round out the almost perfect cast. All directed by Stanley Kubrick this is a tour de force. Oh but streaming problems really brought me down. Since going to Silverlight from Adobe has been frustrating . It has been herd to watch movies. I have had nothing but problems streaming movies.
1587143879|4.0|Covers a lot of detail in a very gradual and easy to understand way. More labs would have been good though. So if you need to practice , you will need to get more labs  elsewhere.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|Have watched multiple times and never gets old.  Amazing story about moonshine operations back in the day with a legendary family that could not be stopped or killed.  Lots of good action with interesting story line.  They do a great job of making you really hate the 'bad' / good guy and really love the 'good' / bad guys.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I first got this book on a CD and after listening to the first 2 I decided two things. 1- Books on disc are not for me, 2- I cant wait to actually READ the book. So I went and checked it out. I read this book in about3 day! I loved it, the story line was great, kept me engaged the entire time. I fell in love with the character's right off the bat. I could not put the book down. I was worried with it being such a long story it would start to drag, but to my surprise it didn't drag at any point. It may be labeled as a YA book, but it is a book for all ages, as I am 30(Shhhh don't tell) and loved each and every one of them.<br /> When the book was over, I went straight to the library to check out the rest of the series, and to my dismay they didn't have them. I went to 3 different libraries until I found the rest of the books. I read all of them and everything else was put on the back burner. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good PNR & YA books that actually have depth to them! Unlike other series I've read that get worse as they go along, this one gets even better. To get a better feel or grasp on this story I would read Clockwork Angel(and the Infernal Devices before starting this series. Well I hope you've decided to get it, you won't be disappointed!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome...you get to see the whole world of Despicable Me 1 &amp; 2!<br />Keeps kids entertained!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|The flexibility of setting multiple alarm events is great, but the main problem is there is no volume control for the alarm sounds.<br />On my Kindle Fire the sound was much too low for anything except having the Kindle right next to your head.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is perfect for minion lovers which I am one of them. This game is very family friendly. It is perfect.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I'VE LOVED THIS GAME SINCE MAY AND HAVE PURCHASED PEARLS TO HELP ME THROUGH ALOT OF THE STORY LINE...I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOAD THE GAME FOR 2 DAYS NOW...IT SAYS CONNECTING TO SERVER FOR OVER 3 MINUTES AND THE SAYS NEMO'S REEF HAS STOPPED! I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I AN'T GET BACK TO PLAYING...WAS ON LEVEL 21 AND HAD JUST PURCHASED 2400 PEARLS WITH HALF OF THEM LEFT!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So far so good, only on second week, it's such a good series that I can just tell this one is going to be just as great as the other two seasons..
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read the sequel to this book which I received as a gift and was immediately sucked in. I really liked it. I had to go and buy the predecessor here on Amazon. & I enjoyed it as well. They're both stand alone books but together they weave a cohesive tale. Recommended
B00002R0MC|5.0|This is an awesome compilation of Bob's music.  It shows his growth from ska, through rock steady and onward to reggae; his lyrical versatility; and his songwriting brillance.  It just captures Bob, and why 400 years from now his music will still be playing.  It's a must have.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Benigni was a very great actor. His character showed that one can make the most of the most horrible circumstances with enough love, willpower and imagination. This movie was truly inspiring.
1419707299|5.0|My son loved the book.  It was very entertaining.  It is great for preteens and up.  We are very happy with the purchase.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|used it for a project at school. very nice quality. loved the movie. kept me on my toes the whole way.
B003SCSQQM|2.0|I haven no idea why I bought this... It is okay quality but I give it 2 stars because I thought it would be high quality. Nothing else to say.
B000059TPN|4.0|I had seen this movie previously and when I heard of the special edition Criterion Collection version of the DVD, I decided that was the one to spend my money on.  I am very pleased with the purchase, the quality of the transfer and the improvements over the standard DVD version.  It is a great movie and all the principle actors do an impressive job!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  Love that the % and decimal are so well placed on the pad. The calculator consumes the entire screen space so it is super-easy to tap and read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game it is very fun and entertaining with twists and turns (and I mean that literally) but once caught by a train there is very little help to be found when the keys to get out of jail cost a small fortune that cannot even be paid in any part with the gold you just got run over by a train to make. Fun game and yet something is amiss...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Like fine wine, this series gets better w age! each episode gets better than the next! Love it , very entertaining. It's like two shows in one. With two story lines, one w the hired help and the other with the rich upper class w fictional history mixed in !
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is so funny, my wife and I are addicted to it. Great, intelligent humor and an intriguing storyline.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app for keeping track of your power levels. I have it on all my portable electronics.I really like the information on the amount of time that's left to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  Please hurry and get more levels!!  I like this game better than floors!  lets get more levels!!
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book was a little slow at first.It did get better when I realized what it was about.A good read and very sad.It would be a good book club book
0786838655|3.0|The Lightning Thief is an engaging story involving Percy, a confused teenage boy, who does not fit in no matter which boarding school he attends. His mother loves him dearly, but Percy and his step-dad do not get along, because \\"Smelly\\" Gabe treats him like crap. And don't even mention his \\"real\\" father, because Percy has few memories of that stranger. Due to all this, our dark-haired and green eyed boy has attitude problems, learning problems, and family problems. Of course, Percy tries to hide all his insecurities and anger behind a tough facade and - mostly - lame jokes. But deep down, our troubled youngster is seeking for some meaning to his problematic life. Something that explains exactly who he is and why he is like this.<br /><br />Almost immediately in the story, Percy stumbles upon the fact that he is not a mere mortal at all! Turns out he is a half-blood: a child born from the union of a mortal and a god. No wonder, he has felt like he did not belong in the modern world. It also explains why his \\"real\\" father has never been around, because his dad is a member of the ancient Greek pantheon.<br /><br />Yes, those guys still exist, and most of them still live on Mount Olympus - which is suspended above the Empire State Building!<br /><br />Yes in New York City!<br /><br />Because you see, the Greek gods are not really the gods of ancient Greece at all but of western civilization itself. So as the center of the western world has shifted through the ages, the Greek gods have migrated with it through numerous countries until they found themselves centered in the good, old U.S. of A..<br /><br />Once Percy discovers his godly heritage, his life is in grave danger . . . from otherworldly monsters! Thankfully, our teenage hero finds allies to help him escape his pursuers and reach sanctuary. The trip is fraught with danger, monsters and fighting. Percy comes through it all however, discovering otherworldly abilities within that he doesn't understand and that surprises those at camp. Yeah, the safe haven Percy has been through hell to get through is Camp Half-Blood: a summer camp for the god's kids.<br /><br />At camp, Percy goes through the normal juvenile process of fitting in; some of the other half-bloods like him and some do not, i.e., there is a bully who instantly hates him. He meets ancient, powerful individuals from Greek mythology, lives in a house with the other campers, participates in camp \\"activities,\\"drinks from self-filling cups, and realizes that he might have some destiny to fulfill. His mentors even try to train him to fight with ancient weaponry. (It seems good, old-fashioned firearms do not work for the gods of western civilization or their offspring. Who knew?) Percy naturally shows uncanny abilities, is gifted with a wondrous weapon of power, finds himself on a quest that he is not prepared for but which he must undertake to save the world from certain destruction, and finally finds the true friends who understand his teenage pain.<br /><br />Even though I do not read many Young Adult novels, The Lightning Thief made me want to try more; it was just good old fashioned fun. The Olympian mythology kept things interesting, the writing was fast-paced and enjoyable, the characters were fun, and Percy - though dense at times - was an interesting protagonist. So for all those reasons, give this one a try.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention that I read this as a bedtime story to my kids?<br /><br />I didn't.  Well, I read it to them every nite for a couple months.  They loved it.  I did to, because it put them to sleep within 10 minutes tops.  And that my friend made this book a daddy's best friend!ises those at camp.

B004SH40BQ|1.0|It was great at first and i really enjoyed not having a wired headset getting hung up on everything while I was working untill it quit working after about 1 month.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|Basically an updated version of the earlier films this time with cyberterrorists. All the action you have come to expect from John McClane
B00957T6X6|5.0|Now I wait for the next book, ready for it any day now.  Need to know what happens next.  Thanks!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I love Five Finger Death Punch and was honestly scared they'd turn into every other band. Release a solid CD, then become radio friendly and suck. Not the case STILL as they release yet another gem!<br /><br />This album has a good mix of \\"radio friendly\\" metal and in your face metal. The only people hating it are either FFDP haters or people that simply listened to the 30 second trials of each song (probably the same people). If you like metal, this CD rocks, if you like FFDP you will love this CD!<br /><br />The guests on the songs are awesome. Moody kinda over shadows them though as each singer only has about 10 seconds of their own time, then they sing together with Moody. I'm a huge In This Moment fan and Maria Brink compliments Moody perfectly, but their song together doesn't let it happen long enough. Tech N9ne is obviously awesome, but he only has one verse. I guess its the fact that these guests fit perfectly that make you want more, but thats the only \\"complaint\\" I have. It isn't like other guests where they don't fit with the music at all, these were picked well and blended well. Plus you get the songs without the guests, so if you hate them, you still get FFDP on their own.<br /><br />The more I listen the CD the more awesome I think it is. Can't wait for the next CD.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Had the 5800k .. I bought6800k playing battlefield 3 on ultra with a NVidia 650Ti believe it or not. Medal of honor ultra settings. Overclocking up to 4.7 stable it was well worth it ..Sold my 5800k on amazon for 90.00 so I only paid 70 or so dollars for this processor. The beta of Battlefield 4 just came out and that's playing on ultra settings also. This A10 6800K processor is well worth the money!
B0060FXDCG|5.0|My youngest daughter loves the Transformers.  She was so excited when this arrived in the mail and we gave it to her.  Speedy delivery.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Love this show. This buy was great and instant! Loved having it right on my computer and still have it to watch as many times as I want. Very happy with this purchase.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is pretty awesome for a free app. it's like a way better awesomesauce kick butt superhero iron man version of temple run.
B00C2IN78U|1.0|So the movie itself is decent.  Not great in any means, but decent.  The issue I have is that Amazon sent me the dvd in the Steelbook packaging that clearing states it should be the Bluray.  If I am going to watch this movie it isn't for the writing nor the acting, it is for the special effects that I was planning on seeing in Bluray quality.  I didn't notice this until recently as I didnt watch it yet so I missed the return window.  I have an email in Amazon, if they fix this issue, I will update me review.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a dramatic season.  Such a good show!  I can't wait until season four airs.  I'm glad I found a show that I don't have to censor with my kids around...
B00015YVD6|4.0|This is what happens when the human decides to become a merman instead of the mermaid becoming human. Love Tom Hanks but for some reason his character is way too high strong and over reacts to everything. That didn't bother me. Watch it and enjoy!
B009LDD5E0|5.0|I have loved Glee since Season 2, missed watching Season 1 so I watched before Season 2. Ever since then I have been hooked!! Every week I get excited about my weekly medicine of Glee!! Love the show!!! So devastated when Cory passed, he was one of my favorite characters!! Some of the episodes were Cheesy but I will always love the show until it ends!! Then I will have all my episodes I can watch over again!! I am excited about Season 4 coming out on DVD soon, as it will also be the last time we will see Finn (Cory) Those episodes I will treasure!! Cant' wait to own my own copy of this fabulous show to add to my collection!!! GLEEK FOREVER!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much I play it all the time and just got a new high score of 72 thousand. Get this game it's amazing. ;)
B002QRWJA4|3.0|The film was done very well. Great singing. The concept of this story is too Emo to make me ever want to watch it again. The casting was perfect though.
B004CMBZJC|5.0|It was a good show I wish it would come back on tv all need to see it. I loved it
B0083Z3O8Y|1.0|It was boring and way too long!!  I kept on reading hoping something beautiful would happen or something with a grand ending.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is an ok app it is interesting. Also is fun but involved lots of thinking. If you don't like thinking this game ain't for u.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great time saver, mental release and stress reducer. I truly love this game from the first time my granddaughter showed me how to play.  Interestingly most of my adult friends are hooked.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Good game to play when really bored.  Not really challenging but good way to pass the time . Easy for kids to play.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have finally finished the book after reading it for 2 years and the the 3rd book was definitely worth the time it took me finished it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun and gives you something to do when you have nothing else to do. Makes the time go by. would like to make gems quicker
B006RXPUR2|5.0|Well done Affleck Bros. Product came as advertised. Bostom accent can be a little thick, but great story telling yo
B000SEI230|5.0|Amazing. Cried for the last 60% if the book and then some. Inspired me to be a better person. Nicholas sparks is amazing
B006LSZECO|3.0|Highly suspenseful, exciting, suprising, and would have been much better with less than half of the course language!  I found all the 4 letter words distracting, and more than once I almost put the book away.  I wouldn't read another book by this author, if it started off with the same course language.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My first ebook...I loved it! Good book, suspenseful, however I didn't care for the ending. I wanted Katniss (sp) to go with the other guy. Should've known it wouldn't happen though, lol.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story was very moving, and told from a suprising perspective.  I feel like I have a better understanding of a dark period of our American history.  Great character development..
0812984412|5.0|Having seen the movie first, then read the book (the book being better in my judgment), I am intrigued by the connections being made: the presence of the past combined with the pull of the future on the present.  In a nearly mystical way it depicts a comment by Einstein: &#34;The distinction between past, present, and future is only a persistent illusion.&#34;  The book can be difficult to follow and is not exactly an easy read.  But that is part of its illusive charm.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was so cute and a great movie to watch with my 6 & 9 year old girls.  We had a great time watching it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a wondrous, scary fairy tale !  Took me back to the pure joy of reading when I was younger!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Like a good book, I couldn't put it down. Great season and looking forward to the next season and to see the next twists and turns.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Having seen the movie first, the book fleshed out several plot points and explained a few things the movie didn't touch on.  However, both the movie and even more so, the book are just way too violent.  The whole concept of the games assumes people can accept violence against children as entertaining.  Even though the book is for young adults, I can't accept that premise even in some future.
0062119044|4.0|Interesting style to tell the story through letters.  Can be slow at times but then the author picks up the pace and continues to reveal the story in chronological fashion.  Fascinating conclusion.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Few authors draw me into a book like Neil Gaiman. As an elementary teacher, I first had just such a powerful experience with The Graveyard Book, but now in this tale, a more adult \\"yarn,\\" Gaiman uses spine tingling imagery and classic themes to deliver an equally unpredictable page turner.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great fun.  Wouldn't mind if it moved to HBO so could get a little more racy.  Great characters and dynamic and good story line.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This thrilling Western is told through great actors portraying slaves, bounty hunters, and an insane plantation owner.<br />Christolph Waltz is by far the best performance as the Dentist. His quirky manurisms and odd personality cap this movie as Django's friend and mentor.<br />Leonardo DiCaprio is an actor I've always seen as the protagonist, the good guy. But in this film, he runs his plantation Candyland and shows his insanity towards his enemies. His evil but stunning performance along with Samuel Jackson make Django Unchained a must watch
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Gets better every episode and every season.  Great personalities, great story and always keeps you intrigued.  Can't wait for the next....
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I like the game so far. But it keeps freezing up on the second round. Have not got past it so I will only give it two stars for now.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|So many artistic  instruction these days seems to fall into one of 2 camps: Either you are driven to be unique - to the point of being incomprehensible, or you are asked to follow exacting formulas to success.<br /><br />This book offers an alternative to these two approaches: Basically that you copy (paraphrase) works that you admire and let your own style evolve naturally from that.<br /><br />Not a bad approach!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a cute game and a tad bit addictive. I love it  and it is one of my favorite games for the kindle.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|This is an okay book for people who have not been introduced to the New Age concepts of magical thinking.  It is easy to read.<br /><br />If you have been introduced to these concepts, it is pretty much just a re-hash.<br /><br />These &#34;practical experiments&#34; may work well for some people - who am I to judge?  However, I have never been very good at  this kind of miracles on demand approach.<br /><br />It's not an expensive book.  If you are new to these concepts and curious, go ahead and try it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. Its wonderful and I play it all the time. Its super fun and entertaining and it keeps me from boredom. Yayyyyy everyone should but subway sitters cause its the best game ever.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Been looking for the song &#34;Crazy&#34; (not the Patsy one) for awhile.  So happy I found it and Amazon made it easy to buy.  It got here quickly and I'm enjoying it so much!
0062255657|5.0|I had a lot of pleasure reading this book.  Neil Gaiman knows how to write from a child's point of view and, no matter how fantastic, it all was quite real to me while reading this.
B00001NTXN|5.0|Perfect for two and very strategic with 3-4. Can cause hard feelings, so it's not for non-gamers. Trapping and other strategies can be pretty tough to pull off with more than two players and the game changes every time you play it.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|Mr. Pip is one of those sleep books.  We read it as part of a book club read from our local library.  It takes place in New Guinea in an area that is known as Bougainville.  All the places are real, they can be located on a map.  The people are also real, in terms of fictional real.  There is a level of violence that is distrubing in this book.  but, it is violence that should be acknowledged as existing.  The characters are very well developed. The plot is convoluted and twisted and the story gets more complex as you read on.  If you haven't read the book by Dickens, Great Expectations, look it up or reread it before starting Mr. Pip.  the character Mr. Pip is taken from Great Expectations.  From there the story unfolds.  There is a town, the town is under attack through no fault of their own, there is an Australian  mining company that is raping the land in order to get at their copper, the people of the land get virtually nothing in return.  Some of the natives are hired by this company and the native New Guineans are treated as second class citizens in their own country.  But, there is no education and the people are so backward and primitive that one wonders if there is any hope.  Then come one white man and he sets himself up as a teacher in this village.  He brings in Great Expectations and reads 59 chapters to these children. Imagine a book that takes place in 19th century England being read to New Guinea islanders who have no concepts of streets, horses, plumbing, buildings, etc.  The influence on the children is great and the story is told through the eyes of these villagers.  It is one of those books that one might consider life changing.  The violence is disturbing but it is worth it.
B00A0MJA1I|3.0|This is a great classic and my daughter loves it. Unfortunately, Discount Central USA sold me a used set. They shrink wrapped it so you'd think it was new but upon opening we found the paper insert was crinkled and all dented up. The DVD has scratches all over it and the Blu-Ray has a dent in it. Amazon quickly refunded my money.
B005LAII44|1.0|Disappointing. I grew up watching GI Joe and was excited to see this movie. However, despite a couple great actors (Bruce Willis and The Rock - Willis role was minimal), this movie was awful.<br /><br />They tried to include all the characters that you want to see, but that was about as far as this movie gets. My seven year old son could have come up with a way better, more blow 'em up, exciting plot. This movie falls short all the way around. Only three decent action sequences in the whole film.<br /><br />My advise, if you really want this movie, wait until it's a couple bucks used.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|I liked it a lot. The newer version (with Leonardo DiCaprio) is almost the same wording. Both are great movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it kept me reading. I couldn't put it down and that's what I look for in a book. If it's too wonderful to put down, that's a great book!
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|I've watched the movie many times and it doesn't fail to take your mind to a harder time in the search for the American dream.
0763644765|5.0|My boy is a bit over three, and he used to scream when we tried to sit him on the potty. He will be in pre-school after the summer, and I wasn't too excited about him still wearing a diaper in the pre-school.<br /><br />I found this book at TJMAXX, and had no idea the difference this book is going to make, and what a huge difference it had made! My boy love stories, and this story of the cute little boy with a cute butt seemed just for him. My boy loved to role play the little boy when I read the story to him, and sat on the potty. After he got used to the potty, he did his first pee-pee in three weeks, and did the first poo poo three days after! We also got his beloved Spiderman undies in the meantime, and he never went back to diapers. It has been two months since then, and he had only had two incidents earlier, and that is it. Now he loves going to bathroom. I am going to pay a bigger water and sewage bill this period, and it all worth it.<br /><br />Another boy in his day care that is 8 months older than him is still wearing pull-ups, but he is already pull-up and incident free, and ready for pre-school!
B004EWFV9K|3.0|I found this book very disappointing. It is very disjointed. It is basically a jumble of anecdotes about Wallender's depression about his old age--when he is only 60!-- his scattered intimations of death, perhaps Alzheimer's; of complicated discussion of spying in Sweden involving the Americans, East Germans, and Russians before, during and after the Cold War,etc. Even the central &#34;mystery&#34; of the book is uninteresting, drawn out, and does not come to a satisfying conclusion. A wilted end to what I once found to be a gripping series.
B001LMO1CE|5.0|I have loved this song for a very long time, and now I get to listen to it whenever I feel like it! If you like ColdPlay, definitely get this song. It's amazing!
B000OCXI3K|4.0|But still very well written. All of the French words were a little annoying. I loved how the descriptions make you see what is written.<br />I will try another book by this author.
B000HF0J36|4.0|I didn't like how basically all the people died but I guess what do you expect from a shark horror movie, right? Overall awesome story line and great acting.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The first two books by this author were spectacular and therefore by comparison this one was mediocre. This novel was unable to weave and tie the story strands to complete the overall picture and it's meaning. The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sun's were heart breaking, gut wrenching and were able touch the souls of the readers.  This story did not paint the picture, draw you in and take the reader on life's journey in Afghanistan.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game had a great mix of puzzles. The story was entertaining and it looked great. I really enjoyed it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love also the background story of all of the things that happened on the island that led to how and why he doing the job that he is doing. Although  he deserved to get dised by the girl that he loves the most, I secretly hope that someday they can get together. But it does make the show quite interesting though.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Amazon sent this to me for my Kindle Fire that stopped charging. It worked great for that for a few weeks, but no longer charges. I use it for other items, and its perfect!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|The result of ignoring truth is chaos and death. Denzel is Eli in this movie of GOOD vs. EVIL.  He has hidden power that is drawn out by evil characters who over-estimate their own power and under-estimate the incredible power that is present in him. Eli's strength is well hidden in his weakness. The evil ones believe that his power is hidden in a book. Their entire effort is to steal the book from him and to kill him. The question you will have is, &#34;Can weakness win over brute beastly power?&#34;
B004NO03E2|5.0|I got two CDs as a gift for my friend (this being one of them) and not only do I love it, but he loves it too! Came in perfect condition, cellophane wrapped and all. I recommend this seller as this one came in fairly quickly too.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Based on the true story of the 5 member, Spanish, Belon family, who all miraculously survived the 2004 tsunami that hit Thailand, this film was truly scary and amazing. The film took the liberty of changing the family's nationality to English, probably to accommodate the stars who were portraying them. But beyond that the story stuck pretty close to actual events, as I read them later. The special effects were incredible in this movie and left you wondering if the actors were actually in a tsunami. I don't know how the film team did what they did, but needless to say, I was impressed. The movie just doesn't disappoint in any way. The concept, script, cinematography, special effects, acting, make up....all top notch! I could go on, but I'll end this by encouraging everyone to see this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this is a great game to play . me and my sisters play it all the time, but mostly me. it takes a while to get used to it and to get alot of coins . i think that this game works best if you like challenges because , this is basically what its about . from time to time the places change from paris to bejieng .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Whenever I need a &#34;pick-me-up&#34;, I watch Downton Abbey.  It's the BEST!  Try it, it works!  Better than a buch of calories!
B000F4RHB6|4.0|All the same beat, but it is fun and happy music.  Good music to dance to and to sing along with-
B000FC1MCS|1.0|I read for education, inspiration or entertainment.  This book did none of these things for me, and I do not recommend it for recreational reading.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Very fun, and different from other puzzle games. Requires a good deal of thinking and planning ahead. The only downside is that it doesn't have enough levels!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I have tried other note apps for my kindle but this one is by far the best for my needs.  I love being able to have multiple notebooks for multiple purposes.  A great app that makes my kindle even better.
B00722ZHG6|4.0|I love Birdy. Her voice and style are phenomenal, especially for her age. My only complaint is that none of her songs are original - they're all covers from various artists (Bon Iver, Pheonix, The Naked and Famous, The Xx etc.) While I have no problem listening to covers, I still wish some of her songs were written by her. Maybe that's just not her talent!
B00DU74U74|5.0|Very good movie. Its been awhile since I read the book but as far as I remember this movie follows the book well. I especially liked that they actually had her thoughts so we could hear them.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|It doesn't zip all the way arounf like I'd hoped but this pouch does the job in a stylish way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pretty cool but I can't wait until the next<br />Couple updates come out. I hope there is<br />Villagers and nether portals that work
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse as a replacement for a known brand mouse. I am very pelased with this mouse. It's very good one for the price and what I like most is the anti-tangle braided cable. My hand is a little big but fits the mouse desing well.<br /><br />There are only 2 bad things about this mouse for me:<br /><br />1. If youre hands are wet, or your hand is sweating the mouse looses its grip.<br /><br />2. The side buttons are not registered has mouse buttons so you must use the product software to set profiles to every game instead of changing settings ingame.<br /><br />The mosue macro recording doesn't work with my logitech gaming keyboad but I think its pretty obious why(it's another brand and has its own macro recording). But its not a big deal since I can give another function to all buttons.<br /><br />In my little experience with gaming mouses I recomend this one over higher priced ones so far. Will see how this ones works after months of heavy use.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|So many times the author had opportunities to make this really great but she missed her opportunities<br /><br />There are a lot of really great scenes. But there were other times when the story could climaxed in such a way to make this one of the best novels of all time
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The new outfits are glichy,and they suck. Also I used to be a pro now I suck for some reason and when you done with the small rainbow power it auto maticly kills you this game sucks I do not recommend it unless your a app horder this sucks!!!!!!!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Keeps you coming back for more as in 2-3 episodes back to back in one setting. Please keep them coming.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This was my first real introduction to Doctor Who.  Christopher Eccleston does a great job filling the Doctor's shoes.  He's got a harder edge than David Tennant's Doctor.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't get enough of it. The thoughts of seeing another episode keeps me going. Please bring me more as soon as possible.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Unfortunately, I did not like this movie at all.  The first Hangover had a decent plot which made it flow easily. I remember it being<br />&#34;laugh out loud funny&#34;  during many scenes.  In this movie there is just too much cursing and partying and not enough good acting.<br />The reason I gave it 3 stars........my husband thought it was funny.  Otherwise, I would give it only two stars.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My boyfriend had saw this movie in theater, so I bought it for him as a gift. He loved it! One of his favorite movies.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Seems like they tried to change from the almost cartoonish version in the first one to make it seem more realistic in the second and it didn't work. The first one was awesome and they should have left it alone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This has been a little hard to get into, but the more I read the better the character development deepens. I do look forward to the movie, understanding the culture and times is a must for the best understanding of this book.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is great!! I have a RAZR maxx HD so I can't just pop out my SD card and move files to it on my computer. This app takes that hassle out of the equation. Great app!!
B0010SB6OK|3.0|My review suffers from reading Reynolds novels out of published order, so I'm comparing early Reynolds to a later version of himself, which is entirely appropriate for this book.  Had I encountered Century Rain before the Revelation Space novels I would have thought the writing was interesting in concept but weaker in pace and character than other writers of space opera.  Had Reynolds been frozen in time at that point in his writing, I would not have followed him further.  But from the perspective of this alternate Earth I now occupy,  the Reynolds of the future worked out the kinks and is a great storyteller.  From this privileged perspective I can say Century Rain is a worthy read, and a good introduction of great ideas and characters to come.
B00ASVX1BQ|5.0|Excellent material completely satisfied and would recommend it for all people who like Rock Metal Simphonic. Tarja Turunen is a queen.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I've been a Porcupine Tree fan for over 10 years and while I do miss them Steven Wilson has an outstanding group of musicians on his solo DVD. The sound is wonderful as to be expected when Mr. Wilson is involved. If you ever have the chance to see them live I highly recommend it!
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|Excellent material completely satisfied. This material is also what I have in the original version Vinyl LP 80's, in perfect condition and now I have the CD version.
0452289963|5.0|this guys is so inspirational.<br /><br />THE POWER OF NOW is a MUST READ!<br /><br />Highly recommended, that will change your life
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really simple and fun game. Fast paced swiping arcade style game that can keep you playing for hours. Great game to play when you are bored and need to kill some time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|They will play for hours at a time on this thing.  It reminds me of another game which I can't place my finger on the name.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It was a gift for a parent, and they were very happy with it. Shipping was quick, product was exactly as described.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love playing this game....and the graphics are not bad as well.Pretty cool how you can progress to each level..great game!!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|It was a gift for a parent, and they were very happy with it. Shipping was quick, product was exactly as described.
0060558121|4.0|I'm new to this book and had never heard of it until I saw that HBO will be doing a new series on it for next year (which now has been denied). That said, I read so much hype about this book and how unique, creative and thought-provoking it was so, of course, I had to get it. I read it and found the concept interesting enough; definitely very original. The hype around it may have taken a little from it.
B0030FUAKW|3.0|okay but you have to enjoy the WALKER BROTHERS.<br />If you like the WALKER BROTHERS you'll find this<br />satisfactory.  THANKS
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I'm a huge Disney fan, but this recent movie is one of my favorites.  Lots of fun and funny scenes, and a great lesson to be learned by all! :)
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had only seen the movie before and i enjoyed the book even more. Its a good book for all ages.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This was a fantastic movie, we had seen it before and were  very happy to find it and buy it.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|I used sketchbook express (on my Nexus 7) for a few months before upgrading to this. It's as good and better. The quicker shortcuts and color picker are very convenient, and the freedom of more layers (and blend modes) is nice. The app still hangs for a few seconds sometimes when changing brushes, but it's rare enough to be tolerable.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|this album is fantastic. i have been anxiously awaiting this since... well, promised land, frankly... i am a queensryche fan because of empire.(late to the game i know) heck, i became a (wannabe) audiophile because of empire. a good friend of mine turned me onto it back in the day swearing it would change the way i listen to music and he was right. to this day empire and promised land are two cd's i use as reference... (i actually really like hear in the now frontier, yes it's different and it took some getting used to, but i eventually just grew to appreciate it's progressive quality... but since then every album has been a major struggle to enjoy. the last one i actually liked some of quite a bit but i digress...)<br /><br /> but FINALLY a queensryche album to cheer about!! my second favorite album of the year behind steven wilson's 'raven that refused to sing' which is itself a sonic masterpiece, having no dynamic  compression at all apparently. it made me ask 'why do we NEED mastering'? i have to wonder if guys like jimbo barton get frustrated after putting their expertise to a project, only to have some other dope wreck their work! this doesn't sound nearly as bad as the cd released this year by some other band calling themselves queensryche, but COME ON!<br /><br /> i'd pay to buy this album again at a premium if someone would release a remaster... shoot. with scott rockenfield's penchant for creating sonic landscapes i'm surprised there's not a dvd-a 5.1 mix!  this album deserved to be a reference album!<br /><br /> well done, (the REAL) QUEENSRYCHE! well done jimbo barton! tom baker...shame on you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It was very cool I liked the charachters and everything the only part I did'nt like was if I went left; it would go right or something like that.Otherwise,  it was awesome! You need to try this app!
1608862771|5.0|This guy is just great! I love his overdetailed style, this is the kind of illustration book that you can spend hours looking into the details and still be amazed.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|This was a fun little game until today, suddenly it will not work on my Kindle fire!<br />I  am extremely disappointed. The children and I was having fun figuring out the solutions to the puzzles, and I would like it very much if I could get a fix for this game.
B002E66C6E|5.0|If you like movies about Submarines, this is a classic. Drama, suspense, great acting and all around fun.  One of my favorites.  Das Boot, Hunt For Red October, Enemy Below, U-571, Crimson Tide.  A must have.
B005UD1D62|4.0|Good book! Great continuation to the rest of the series. Interesting to see the characters develop. Good book. Quick read.
B00846REIS|5.0|This novel has a great story line that kept me turning every page.  I could not put it down!  I quickly downloaded the next one.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I don't often taken the time to review game. However, Factory Balls is wonderfully made that it deserved a glowing review. The game is fun, challenging and expertly designed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great novel!  I can't wait for the next one to come out.  PLEASE don't be a long wait.  I am dying to see what happens next!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I miss the detail the old map showed. With the old map I got a satellite view of the Terrain with cloud cover. The new app doesn't offer that. As far as the weather goes the app gives a very accurate forecast but I prefer the old app. It was accurate too.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book turned out to be more than I expected.  I have started doing the daily practice listed in the book and it is amazing how it can make a difference in your life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game so far. My daughter is only at level 4, but says it reminds her of the horse game she use to have on her D S. Which she loved that game also.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Watched the TV show on PBS and then read this.  Tried the diet and it works and it makes sense to me.  Very good!
0670026557|5.0|Give and Take articulates the blessings afforded to those that are truly servant leaders in the business world better than any than anything I've read on the subject.  After reading it I purchased addition copies for my team in the spirit of giving.
B00CZAYNOC|2.0|THis is not five finger death punch. THis feels like it was written and created by your typical song writers.  They are dead, and will not be able to make a come back. It is to bad too, i really like all their previous albums save the last one and this one.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|After reading both of Khaled Hosseini's other books and loving them both I had very high expectations for this book, unfortunately I found it dragged out and boring, three quarters of the way throughI the book there were still new characters being introduced, and for what reason? I don't know, the different stories didn't come together at the end, very disappointing ...
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great third book in series!! Love the story, writing style, and the CHARACTERS! Also love the differing views in every chapter!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book delivers concrete evidence in the experiment results that there are indeed limitless possibilities.  Love her sense of humor and making proof accessible.  Thank you Pam Grout!!!
1451695195|5.0|Loved this book...easy to read and lends credibility to the reality of the spirit and a life beyond our earthly, finite existence.  It's especially compelling because it's written by a scientist, who didn't believe in NDE's as anything more than some chemical reaction in the brain.  However, when he had his own NDE while in a coma, he had a very well developed mystical experience, which was undeniable, not to mention his miraculous recovery, when all odds were against his survival, no less full recovery.  He has shifted 180 degrees in his unshakable belief, based on his own personal experience, that there is a life past our earthly one, and it's effused with LOVE.  Read this book!!
1932073221|5.0|Hello i think this book creating money is the best book i have read on creating money because its much more than that!!!! Its a life book!!! Coming from the spirits  of who we really are! but whatever you believe is fine if you take the time to read and study this book do the questions it will change your it has mine!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't get enough! More episodes and not a year for a new season! Please! Only negative is the amount of time you have to wait for a new season. A lot of people forget and dvr new series at that point.
0553386794|4.0|Purchased this book for husband. He reads it and is generally an adamant non-fiction type. I think the type face might be a bit small, but overall it's readable.
B000N5F6OW|4.0|Great photography of African animals and a star-studded cast make this one of John Wayne's best movies; worth watching twice.
B00BQH9SY0|4.0|I never heard of this band before until a friend told me about it. I was hooked. catchy melodies, really chill, the only bad thing is that they need to be more dynamic, almos all the songs sound the same, love the lyrics
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I am glad to be able to share these wonderful stories with my 7 granddaughters!  I fear that the classics have been replaced by the modern writers, but they should be added to and not discarded.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|seen the movie, so im intrigued because if the movie was great then the book must be epic, so I heard
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game I'm sure people would love with epic graphics everyone would appreciate also I love how it changes country every so often!!!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|well, how do I say this....THIS SONG ROCK MY SOCK OFF, there I said it, it is a funky melody ,
B009LRE040|2.0|As a fan of Batman I found this severely lacking. The plot revolves around almost everyone but Batman. I was disappointed by the complete diversion from Bane's actual backstory and the way Robin is created. I found this to be a story that does not fit well in the Batman universe. Batman doesn't lose, he doesn't lose because he is the spirit of Gotham. Batman doesn't lose because he plays chess with his rivals and when the time arises can create armies out of the less fortunate masses. Batman has defeated Superman and yet somehow a two bit criminal like Bane defeats him, preposterous. When compared to the two previous films as far as story and continuity it can't stand up. 'Nuf said.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|im just intrigued, I haven't read it yet but overall download time by amazon/ kindle is superb im glad its free. hear good things about it
1781162646|5.0|A long time ago in a town not so far away I started to read books by Stephen King.  From 'Carrie' to 'It' to my favorite 'The Stand', he wrote these amazing novels like none that I had experienced before.  Then came some mediocre (for him) books that didn't really do it for me.  I started reading him again last year when I picked up a copy of &#34;Under the Dome&#34; while at an airport heading to vacation.  Although it started like gangbusters, it ended with a wimpering finish.<br /><br />When I heard about &#34;Joyland&#34; I thought I'd give it another go and I was not disappointed.  Stephen King is the master storyteller and he gets the reader's sympathy for the main character right away.  The descriptions of the locations, characters and ghost story within the crime story is a great blend of the genres.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read and you can't beat the price!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|im just intrigued, I haven't read it yet but overall download time by amazon/ kindle is superb im glad its free. hear good things about it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great little time killer! My kids really enjoy it too. Better than subway surfers. Love Despicable Me! Few in app adds.
159102594X|5.0|im intrigued, I have not read it yet , its on my list of to-dos , but im really looking forward for it, product wise, it came on time and the quality is great
B001AEF6BI|5.0|What can I say!  In my generation this is a classic right up there with The Big Chill!  The great thing about this one is now my young adult children are enjoying it!!  So the classic works in the future generations!
B0026MOVO6|5.0|This is some great R&B music coming from Whitney while still at the top of her game. Too bad we lost her. She is truly a star with star power. Here she belts out song after song in her ageless, timeless style. I highly recommend this for old and new fans. Excellent CD!
0375842209|5.0|I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday on my way home from work. Whew....<br />The Narrator, both the actor who read for the audio and the character were excellent!  Bittersweet, humorous, lovely and memorable! Read it, it's worth it. It's one of those books that when you're finished, you've got to recuperate as you're saying goodbye to many people you've come to love.
B000002A46|5.0|This is some of Mariah's Best music done in her older, more innocent style when she relied mostly on her talent for selling CD's versus her looks. Her looks are a plus definitely, but she is definitely very talented as well and does not need to flaunt to sell. I highly recommend this CD for older or newer fans!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding monsters is an excellent app!!! I love it! It is very very addicting!! Its a simple yet entertaining game. I would recommend this app to all ages!! :) Now quit reading this review and get the app ALREADY!!!!
B000051VWW|5.0|This is a solid SADE CD. If you like her style, the lyrics, and her delivery, this is the CD for you. The tunes are not as memorable as most of her other older &#34;CD&#34;S but this one is a definite sound collection as well. I highly recommend this CD!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised that I like the screenplay and interaction. Both leads played well, and the story line was worth it!
B000001FS3|5.0|These are some memorable U2 tunes. They use their typical musical delivery to belt out memorable and poignant songs with deep lyrics. I would highly recommend this CD for older and newer fans to add to their collection!
B00CMQX84A|1.0|HAHAHAHA was my reaction after watching just 5 minutes of this disgraceful movie. One of these some Disney execs will visit a real-life school or beach or mall and realize that every teen movie over the last 10 years made by them has been embarrassingly wrong.
B0000029LG|5.0|This is an excellent collection of some of Michael's classic hits. You will enjoy every hit performed in Michael's typical style. We lost an excellent entertainer so this is a chance to purchase some history making music. I highly recommend this 2-CD collection for old and new fans!
140006922X|2.0|Reza Aslan's instant best-seller, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, runs on two levels simultaneously.  On the popular level, and in the chapters themselves, the book is an easy-reading popular reenactment of the Jesus story.  (Well, Aslan's one-sided spin on it, that is.  More on that later.)  Meanwhile, in the back of the book, Aslan carries on a dialogue with various scholars.<br /><br />This is necessary, because Zealot purports to be a serious and informed argument for a particular interpretation of Jesus.  Aslan tells us several times how long and seriously he has studied religion, over &#34;two decades of rigorous academic work,&#34; seeming to imply that his academic work was mainly of the historical Jesus.  (It was not.)  Aslan's claim is that Jesus was in some sense a &#34;zealot,&#34; (though not in the stronger sense that later developed).  Aslan believes that Jesus' appeal was chiefly political and we should read the gospels through that grid.<br /><br />Aslan begins by setting the life of Jesus in the context of the rise and fall of Second Temple Judaism within the devouring and unforgiving Roman Empire.  He describes the town of Nazareth, where Jesus was raised, the nearby city of Sepphoris, where he thinks Jesus worked, and rebellions and pogroms that swirled through Galilee and Judea and ultimately led to the violent exile of the Jewish people from their native land.  Much of the territory he covers parallels that covered by John Crossan in The Historical Jesus, though he draws from other scholars as well.<br /><br />Zealot is not the worst book I have read on the historical Jesus.  The popular-level story is well-written, and contains numerous interesting historical insights.  Aslan's dialogue in the back of the book does show that the man has read quite a few scholars, most respectable.<br /><br />But this Aslan is not really up to the job of taking on this lion.<br /><br />First ten quibbles -- it could just as easily be forty -- then vital misunderstandings.  (Some of the &#34;quibbles&#34; are pretty major, too.)<br /><br />I. Quibbles<br /><br />(1) Did the Jews kill everything in Palestine?<br /><br />&#34;It was, the Bible claims, only after the Jewish armies had 'utterly destroyed all that breathed' . . . only after every single previous inhabitant of this land was eradicated 'as the Lord God of Israel had commanded' . . . that the Jews were allowed to settle here.&#34; (16)<br /><br />Maybe this is an example of Aslan relapsing to the prejudices of his Muslim ancestors, and offering a kind of implicit apologetic for animus towards Israel?  But all you have to do is read the bloodiest parts of the Old Testament, to see that no such thing occurred.  Most of the locals were either chased out, or remained.  Glenn Miller counts the &#34;drove out&#34; and &#34;eradicated&#34; passages, and found the former predominated by a ratio of three to one - in at least one case, in the same passage, implying that extermination was not really intended.<br /><br />(2 + 3) What do we know about Q?  How much of the New Testament do the letters of Paul constitute?<br /><br />&#34;The Q material, which was compiled around 50 CE, makes no mention of anything that happened before Jesus' baptism by John the Baptist.  The letters of Paul, which make up the bulk of the New Testament, are wholly detached from any event in Jesus' life save his crucifixion and resurrection (though Paul does mention the Last Supper).&#34;<br /><br />That Q existed is a hypothesis.  When it was written is just a guess.  Aslan guesses way too much about Q, and about many other things.  He should read less John Crossan, and more NT Wright.<br /><br />But the really gross error here is Aslan's claim that the letters of Paul &#34;make up the bulk of the New Testament.&#34;  Actually, they make up about a quarter of the NT by volume.<br /><br />(4) Aslan really has it in for St. Paul, and twists his words wildly to make him look bad.  For instance, he makes it sound as if his concern in Galatians were just a power trip, and that when he wrote, &#34;I am amazed at how quickly you have deserted the one who called you,&#34; he was talking about himself, not Jesus.  That's a grotesque misreading, especially when Paul follows by saying &#34;even if WE preach another gospel,&#34; let him be condemned.  But dissing Paul is important for Aslan's thesis that Christianity is the real &#34;other Gospel,&#34; so he keeps at it unrelentingly.<br /><br />My own view, contra Aslan, is that there is a great deal of the historical Jesus in Paul. Compare, for instance, the Sermon on the Mount to I Corinthians 13.<br /><br />(5)  Were the ancients ignorant of critical history?<br /><br />&#34;Luke would have had no idea what we in the modern world even mean when we say the word 'history.'  The notion of history as a critical analysis of observable and verifiable events in the past is a product of the modern age . . . &#34;(30)<br /><br />I wonder what Aslan means by saying modern history is about &#34;observable&#34; events in the past.  By definition, past events are not observable, as least not at sub-astronomical distances.  No one today can observe Abraham Lincoln take a bullet in the head from John Wilkes Booth.<br /><br />Anyway, Aslan's generalization about ancient writers is nonsense.  Thucydides introduced a clear concept of critical historical analysis almost 500 years before Luke wrote:<br /><br />&#34;I have made it a principle not to write down the first story that came my way, and not even to be guided by my own general impressions; either I was present myself at the events which I have described or else I heard of them from eye-witnesses whose reports I have checked with as much thoroughness as possible.&#34;<br /><br />Aslan's depiction of Luke is patronizing nonsense.  Luke was an educated man, who would have been familiar with earlier historians.  (Aside from Thucydides, Greek historians like Polybius and Arrian represented a rich critical historical tradition, along with many Romans.)  His accounts in Acts have been consistently found to be extremely accurate, with dozens of historical facts he mentions having been verified.<br /><br />It may be, however, that Aslan himself fails to make a sufficient distinction between myth and history, since he is himself in the business of producing a myth of a Jesus fit for &#34;pale clerics and pious ladies&#34; (as Dorothy Sayers put it) in the secularist camp.<br /><br />(6) Was Jesus illiterate?<br /><br />&#34;It is estimated that nearly 97% of the Jewish peasantry could neither read nor write . . . Whatever languages Jesus may have spoken, there is no reason to think he could read or write in any of them, not even Aramaic.  Luke's (accounts) . . . are fabulous concoctions of the evangelist's own devising.  Jesus would not have had access to the kind of formal education necessary to make Luke's account even remotely credible.&#34; (34)<br /><br />Let us set aside for the moment the claim that the vast majority of Jews of the time were illiterate, which is in fact disputed.  Let us also overlook that Jesus belonged to narrower demographics, males, immigrants to the cities, ambitious reformers, among whom literacy was progressively higher.  Aslan is playing a game here, that is simply not legitimate, for an historian.<br /><br />Luke relates that Jesus could and did read.  That itself is a reason to think he could read and presumably write.  One cannot legitimately cast historical accounts into the trash bin on &#34;general considerations.&#34;<br /><br />Every life story includes many details that may seem a priori improbable.  I was born in Seattle, out of thousands of cities in the world.  Does that mean you should disbelieve the story that I was born in Seattle, because a priori odds against it seem so high?<br /><br />Or let's offer a more relevant parallel.  William Carey was a 18th Century shoemaker who taught himself ancient languages while cobbling shoes.  He went on to introduce modern agriculture, printing, botany, and other sciences to India, translating the Bible into many Indian languages, and helping to ignite the Bengali Renaissance.<br /><br />How likely is that story?  No one else in history has ever done all that.  By Aslan's standards, should we then reject accounts of Carey's life as &#34;not even remotely credible?&#34;<br /><br />Learning Greek letters is easy -- it took me less than an hour.  I don't know Aramaic, but imperial Aramaic only appears to have had 22 letters.  I see no reason why an ambitious young man could not have easily mastered the art after hours, with or without goading from his father.  A few hours work, and there you are.  This is simply not a legitimate historical argument.<br /><br />(7) Matthew and Luke &#34;were completely unaware of each other's work.&#34; (36)<br /><br />I suspect Luke did read Matthew, as Mark Goodacre argues.  But at least, let's not be so dogmatic.<br /><br />(8) . . . John, who presents Jesus as an otherworldly spirit without earthly origins . . . &#34; (36)<br /><br />Poppycock.  If anything, the Gospel of John lends special emphasis to the flesh and blood physical reality of Jesus: &#34;He poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples.&#34; &#34;One of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.&#34;  &#34;Reach your finger here and see my hands; reach and thrust your hand into my side, do not be faithless, but believe.&#34;<br /><br />Aslan repeats this nonsense again and again; it's as if he's never read the Gospel.  Maybe AN Wilson's pre-Christian biography of Jesus would be a good corrective for him.<br /><br />(9) Did the gospels fictionalize Pilate?<br /><br />&#34;The gospels present Pilate as a righteous yet weak-willed man so overcome with doubt about putting Jesus of Nazareth to death that he does everything in his power to save his life . . . This is pure fiction.&#34; (47)<br /><br />What Aslan says here is indeed rather fictional.  The gospels depict Pilate as troubled, partly because his wife has had a bad dream about Jesus.  But Luke also relates how Pilate had mixed the blood of another group of Galileans with their sacrifices -- hardly what one would call weak-willed, or righteous, for that matter.  Pilate does not want to give in to the Jewish crowds and hang someone up just on their say-so; is that really so crazy?<br /><br />Aslan has no real grounds whatsoever for rejecting this story, but he does this constantly: he alternates between hypercriticism and utter credulity, picking and choosing depending largely on which text from which source fits his theory.<br /><br />(10) Is the Sea of Galilee a salty arm of the ocean?  Does salt form into clouds?  Is it good for plants?<br /><br />&#34;Capernaum was the ideal place for Jesus to launch his ministry . . . the seaside village of some 1500 mostly farmers and fishermen . . . the entire village stretched along a wide expanse of the seacoast, allowing the cool salt air to nurture all manner of plants and trees.&#34;<br /><br />Capernaum was on the &#34;Sea&#34; of Galilee, which is, and was . . . FRESH water.<br /><br />This book was published by Random House.  Did none of the editors there know where the Sea of Galilee is?  This blunder (erased from later editions) is particularly embarrassing, coming from someone who keeps telling us what a serious scholar he is.<br /><br />And of course, even if the lake were salty, the air would not be, on this planet.  And if it were, the salt would kill, not &#34;nourish,&#34; the &#34;plants and trees.&#34;  (And isn't a tree a kind of plant?)<br /><br />All in all, these few lines pack absurdities closely together, indeed.<br /><br />But enough small ball.  We've established that Aslan is a fallible writer, to put it mildly, and that Random House needs better editors.  Let's go on now to two of Aslan's more important arguments, the interpretive key he brings to the life of Jesus, and his attempt to undermine Jesus' miracles.<br /><br />II.  Jesus, the Zealot?<br /><br />Aslan begins Part II of his book by focusing our attention on Jesus' cleaning of the temple, which he notes that all four gospels relate:<br /><br />&#34;Of all the stories told about the life of Jesus of Nazareth, there is one . . . that, more than any other word or deed, helps reveal who Jesus was and what Jesus meant . . . All four evangelists present this monumental moment in a casual, almost fleeting manner, as though they were either oblivious to its meaning or, more likely, deliberately downplaying (it). . . &#34;<br /><br />Several times Aslan does this -- he cites NT writers and then claims they were &#34;forced&#34; to write some important truth against their wills.  What this should tell Aslan, is that the authors of the gospels were honest men.  He thinks they found these stories embarrassing, yet told them, anyway.<br /><br />But placing the cleansing of the temple (in most cases) just before Jesus' crucifixion, the climactic event of Jesus' life, it is silly to claim the evangelists &#34;downplay&#34; this act.  In fact, they clearly recognize the incident's importance, and deliberately draw their readers' attention to it.  For Matthew in particular, placement of an episode in his gospel is more powerful than rhetorical histrionics such as you might get on a cable news station. (Pick your villain.)<br /><br />Aslan has decided this story will be his clue to interpreting the rest of the gospels.  Like many scholars before him, Aslan is thus like the blind man who grasps hold of one part of the elephant, and declares the creature a snake:<br /><br />&#34;Jesus was crucified by Rome because his messianic aspirations threatened the occupation of Palestine, and his zealotry endangered the Temple authorities.  That singular fact should color everything we read in the gospels about the messiah known as Jesus of Nazareth . . . &#34;<br /><br />To one with a hammer, all the world looks like a nail. In Tristram Shandy, Lawrence Sterne described an intellectual hazard that Shandy's father often fell into, to which historical Jesus studies seem particularly vulnerable, that we call confirmation bias:<br /><br />&#34;It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that it assimilates everything to itself, as proper nourishment; and, from the first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by everything you see, hear, read, or understand . . .&#34; (Sterne I. 44)<br /><br />The danger of &#34;confirmation bias&#34; is great when one reads the gospels, precisely because Jesus is greater than the sum of our expectations.  Thus, we get the Cynic Jesus, the prophet Jesus, the Gnostic Jesus, the Jesus who traveled to India and learned magical tricks, the Aryan and Marxist and bodhisattva Jesus.  Our churches also split Jesus up, and make him a magical savior and neglect his social teaching, or a pillar in the Welfare State, or some other partial Christ.<br /><br />But wisdom, as Jesus himself said, is affirmed by all her children.  The gospels are read like the blind men read the elephant, because Jesus is greater than the sum of our philosophies.<br /><br />Or in C. S. Lewis' great words, Aslan (the other Aslan) is &#34;not a tame lion.&#34;  The goal of this book, in effect, is to tame Jesus for this Aslan's present worldview, to make the &#34;lion of Judah&#34; a &#34;housecat&#34; for &#34;pale priests and pious old ladies&#34; in the secularist camp, to cite Lewis' friend Dorothy Sayers.<br /><br />Following Aslan, let me simply suggest that this whole book is best read in the light of Sterne's warning, and Jesus' aphorism.<br /><br />III.  Just Another Miracle Worker?<br /><br />One aspect of Jesus' character that the modern world has little room for, is the supernatural power by which he healed the sick,walked on water, and raised the dead.  The simplest solution is to cut all this out, as Thomas Jefferson and Leo Tolstoy did.  Others use this as an excuse to throw the whole story out as myth.<br /><br />Aslan takes a subtler approach.  Following Morton Smith, he recognizes that the miracles of Jesus cannot be expunged from the gospel records: they are found in every single layer of gospel material.  And how likely is it that Jesus' first disciples would simply and unanimously invent so important a trait of their master, as that Jesus healed blind people and caused the lame to walk?<br /><br />But magicians were common in those days, Smith claims, and Aslan and others echo him.  (Obscuring the difference between miracles and magic, which they do not recognize -- I write on this in Jesus and the Religions of Man.)<br /><br />&#34;For the vast majority of Jews in Palestine -- those he claimed to have been sent to free from oppression -- Jesus was neither messiah nor king, but just another traveling miracle worker and professional exorcist roaming through Galilee performing tricks.&#34; (102)<br /><br />&#34;Galilee especially abounded with charismatic fantasts claiming to channel the divine for a nominal fee.  Yet from the perspective of the Galileans, what set Jesus apart from his fellow exorcists and healers is that he seemed to be providing his services free of charge.&#34; (103)<br /><br />If that is so, why do people in the gospels always seem so astonished at Jesus' power, which they often recognize as unique and unprecedented?  &#34;Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.&#34; &#34;Since the beginning of time, no one has caused the blind to see.&#34;  &#34;After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they said, 'Surely this is the Prophet who was to come into the world.&#34;<br /><br />Others became angry, and accused Jesus of black magic. (Yes, they do, though Aslan emphatically denies this -- John 8:48.)<br /><br />They reacted, in other words, very much as we would, if we witnessed such things, not at all like people who are just witnessing another flamboyant preacher, like watching a mime at the beach on Saturday afternoon.<br /><br />So I was amused, but not one bit surprised, to find Aslan pointing to the same usual three suspects to support his claim that miracle-workers were a dime a dozen in ancient Israel: Honi the Circle-Drawer, Hanina ben Dosa, and Apollonius of Tyana.<br /><br />I mentioned this same troika, used by John Crossan for the same purpose, already in Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could.  In fact, none of the three is a serious analogy to Jesus, just read the things and you'll see.  But having made this claim, Aslan &#34;just happens&#34; to go to the same three miracle-workers that Crossan did.  And in two of my debates, my opponents (Robert Price and Richard Carrier) also brought up Apollonius, in an attempt to make Jesus seem less unique.  In fact, citing Apollonius as a parallel to Jesus as a miracle-worker (the other two are even less convincing) has become a bad habit, like solving the deficit, and just as mythical.<br /><br />Like Aslan, both men forgot (for one thing) that Apollonius lived after Jesus, and his life was recorded (with much embellishment) more than two centuries later, in a biography sponsored by an opponent of Christianity.<br /><br />Even so, read his biography, and the alleged parallels appear far-fetched and weak.  They serve to show, not how common miracle-workers were in Jesus' day, but that as usual, the evangelists were adept at depicting reactions to Jesus' unprecedented works.  Honi and Hanina were nothing like Jesus: they were men who prayed to God and, on rare occasions, God responded favorably, for instance by bringing needed rain.  Apollonius, I see as a kind of wandering Saturday Night Live skit, sent down from heaven to make skeptics who cite him look silly.<br /><br />Furthermore, as N. T. Wright pointed out, the works of Jesus fit seamlessly into the total story that the gospels tell:<br /><br />&#34;The mighty works do not in any way protrude from the rest of the narrative, as they ought to if they had been added to the tradition by people interested in telling stories of a Hellenistic-style wonder-working hero-figure.  Rather, they fit remarkably well into the complete picture of Jesus' ministry.&#34; (Jesus and the Victory of God, 189)<br /><br />No doubt an exorcist could draw a crowd -- they still draw crowds, in many countries, and sell movie tickets in the US.  But it is silly to say people only followed Jesus because he didn't charge for his healings.  That contradicts both the reasons actually people gave, as recorded in the earliest accounts -- and one should not toss out historical records on a whim -- and clear and powerful differences between what Jesus did, and what his alleged &#34;competitors&#34; are said to have accomplished.  Aslan seems not to have noticed those vast differences, but the crowds obviously did.<br /><br />There is also the problem, so often overlooked by ivory tower scholars, that miracles do in fact seem to still happen. Eminent NT scholar Craig Keener has written a lengthy two-volume series demonstrating this fact, not that none of us knew it already.  Unfortunately, while Aslan has read a lot, he seems to have read very little from a strong and informed Christian perspective.<br /><br />Aslan is a talented writer, and I often find him sympathetic as a person.  His attempt to &#34;explain&#34; Jesus, and Christianity, however, while clever and even perceptive at times, is in the end I think an utter failure.  I would much rather read Jesus' biography of Aslan, and hope to some day have that chance.nd what Jesus meant . . .

B00BPBWYM0|5.0|The Amazon description for the CD is misleading because, fortunately, all of the selections are sung by Francoise Hardy.  The contents of this CD are drawn from three other CD's that are out of print and expensive, should they be found.  The re-mastering is phenomenal because it sounds so great, audio-wise.  As indicated, it is Francoise Hardy singing everything in English with a slight accent (she would never be mistaken as being an American or British) which is a change from her usual French worded sounds.  Previously, with those French sung songs, one could only be amazed at just how musical Francoise Hardy is and I could only appreciate the melody and the phrasing that I could never understand.  Her voice has changed, as time does for most.  So this is a youthful collection from over 40 years ago with stunning audio and great arrangements.  The inside pamphlet is a brief history of her career written by Bob Stanley in 2013.  Francoise Hardy is unique in that she never repeats anything in terms of how it sounds unlike Diana Ross and the Supremes.  So this is a historical record and an extremely pleasurable one to listen to over and over again via a home theater system.  It is always a rare treat to listen to her and this CD is no exception.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've read this book twice. That's how much I want my subconcious to quote it when I doubt myself while trying to be the best I can. As a woman, wife, mother and full-time worker, I've had so many &#34;aha! moments&#34; reading this book it feels as if Sheryl wrote this for me.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This was an eye-opening assembly of research and observations.  I totally got involved and wanted more.  My daughter-in-law, Amber Tabares is quoted often in the Gottman research on relationships.  It's a must read
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Up to his usual great standard. He makes writing seem so effortless. He is yet to disappoint me after all these years.
B008ROH07W|5.0|This is yet another cracking disc from Alison Balsom.  Here she plays music for Royal occasions by Handel and Purcell, both of whom wrote wonderfully for the trumpet, and the result is something rather special.<br /><br />The programme itself is a real pleasure: there are some very well-known pieces and also some less familiar stuff, and it's varied and hugely enjoyable.  Thus we get the vigorous, joyful Sound the Trumpet by Purcell, and also his soulful and deeply moving Plaint from the Fairy Queen, and almost everything in between.  It's a disc you can play from start to finish without it ever sounding samey, and there are some really terrific highlights.<br /><br />The performances are brilliant throughout.  Alison Balsom, of course, is superb and her work here on the baroque trumpet is magnificent.  As always, her playing of the virtuoso passages is a sparkling delight, but it is in the slower, more contemplative pieces that I think she really shines.  The control, lovely tone and emotion she brings are quite exceptional and show her to be a genuinely world-class musician.  She is joined by two fabulous vocalists, countertenor Iestyn Davies and soprano Lucy Crowe, and Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert are, as we have come to expect over may years, outstandingly good.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this disc too highly.  It is a joy and will bring pleasure to those new and new-ish to classical music and to crusty old veterans like me.  It's a gem.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's  awesome but needs tamable wolves, breeding animals,  forests, horses, and saddles<br /><br />Other than that it's great  I love it
B00CFYD682|5.0|First off have to admit that I was only really a Yaz fan when I purchased this CD.  I had seen a Yaz reunion tour a few years ago in NYC which I loved.  I always liked the combination of both parts of the group and never really imagined Moyet on her own. That being said I have to admit that I wasn't really sure if I would really enjoy the solo stuff.  I love it and this CD with a few others is in constant rotation in my car.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are great!  They are nicely sized.  The gems that are included catch the light and add lots of sparkle.  The price is great for everything that you get.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I am a huge Pet Shop Boys fan from the 80's!!  I have a son who is the techno music king in our household.  This CD is a wonderful incorporation of new Tech music (not to heavy or out there) and the PSB that I have loved through the years.  I had already purchased tickets to see them in NYC prior to the release of this CD and am VERY excited to see them live now that I have heard it. Even my son listened to the who thing and said that he may have to borrow it.
B003XDZLTG|3.0|I gave this product three stars because it's technically a great shoe. My reason for adding a sour note to the reviews is that if you're a fellow wide-footer, who may also occasionally have 'flare ups', this shoe isn't for you.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|I'm a huge Paulo Coelho fan and this book is definitely one of my favorites. Veronika Decides to Die is thought provoking. It challanges your views on life and society's norms. A must read!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much better than the first game... a few glitches here and there. The game also freezes from time to time.
1781162646|5.0|This was a fun read. The usual King suspense was there and the great character development which is a King trademark. It was a story that took me back to my teenage years, and any book that transports you is worth the read. I don't want to go over tHE contents because I never want to give one moment of King's web of suspense up to anyone. Read it, you will enjoy it!
B005MMYCY6|5.0|What a fun movie. Has great one liners, and ends up giving you warm and fuzzies at the end....not at all what you would expect at the beginning. Great acting by the whole cast as well - highly recommended.
1469220725|5.0|Loved this book!!  If you read fifty shades of grey and loved it, you will fall in love with this book!!!
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|A much darker film than the original. It kept me entertained for awhile. Only rented because my wife was nagging me to see it with her, go figure.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|Our boys love this and play a lot with it together (1 and 3). They use it for their matchbox and hot wheels cars. Only downside is that they don't fit the lift. they don't use the little gas station yet but maybe will get more interest when they are a little older.
B000TS99I2|5.0|Awesome movie. Great performance by robin Williams and Robert de Niro. One of the best movies I have seen. Watched it for the second time.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|I suppose the impact is greater in a theater, where the actor's faces are twenty feet tall. However, on a computer monitor, the high flying concepts encased in this film seemed to shrink a bit. One cannot fault the production values. They are absolutely impeccable. However, if exploitation of certain memes in Hollywood culture counts as a black mark for getting out of sticky explanation points, well, the narrative structure doesn't maintain the pristine impeccability of the physical design.
B00129H7VS|5.0|We will watch it over and over.  Love it to death. Sharing with many of our family and friends. Thx
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I am enjoying this cute app. It's like farmville without having to bug your friends to help you. You can plant and rearrange your reef. If you want to keep from buying pearls, be stingy with them at the beginning. Don't overspend them during the beginning.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great movie.  Great acting by great actors.  Loved being surprised at the end.  This is a movie I'll watch again.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life.  A true classic and a must see.  Will also explain a few pop culture phrases we run into often.  Enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book!!!! Can't wait for the movie :)  I just couldn't put this book down...I was so drawn in it  was nuts! Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really good free game for the kindle.  My 8 year old really likes it too!  Fun to play and decent graphics with a ,kind of, story line.  Can't be a better deal out there!
B00866H7SS|5.0|I can only dream of a love such as this!!!!!!!!! Despite the difficulties, it would be worth it. Would recommend it highly.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A fictional tale which takes place in a small town in Ireland.  Two stories of a lonely middle-aged man and woman told simultaneously with another back story of a boy growing up in the harsh conditions in a truly wicked orphanage of the times.  Rather than go further into the story, you can read the synopsis or not, but I found it nice to go in without knowing too much and just let yourself get immersed in the story lines. What I loved about this story is it felt so real.  These characters are flawed and imperfect (unlike Hollywood standards) and with very good reasons, but you'll find yourself laughing with them, crying for them, and truly horrified in some instances.  There are so many nuances here as you get to know the people, you'll yearn for a sequel just so you can delve deeper.  A beautifully written heartfelt story which would make a wonderful little Irish Indie film.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|The Cross saga is heartwarming in that the magic continues. With familiarity, the love seem to grow stronger. All women should experience this type of passion, at lease once!!
B001I10ABO|3.0|One of my favorites next to master of puppets and kill em all, the sound is muffled compared to the original 1991 vinyl...  I own both the new 45 and 33 1/3 rpm set and the original 2X LP and I will tell you that you can find the original near mint or mint for the same price as you're paying on amazon or even less.  Discdogs is better if you're after vinyl.<br /><br />Okay now these are 180g vinyl which is great and the vinyl today is usually better than the past but the quality control from the vinyl inspection to it being sleeved is a nightmare!<br /><br />Decent released, piss poor quality control = poor product of a amazing product.<br /><br />If you're after vinyl go for the original, much like rust in peace from megadeth but only for the best sound and better quality control.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this game and got my kids turned on to it also. It is addictive just like everyone told me it was.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The continuous movement from one character in one setting to another is confusing.  It is never clear what the bond is, unless it's the house...
B0001WGDX0|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, and she has been completely enthusiastic about all these performances. I look forward to hearing them myself soon.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|when I first got this game I was really exicted because I love pac-man and racing. it reminded me of Mario cart but switched with pac-man. ignore all these bad comments. this game is A LOT of fun I promise. I hope u will like it as much as I did!!)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|very addictive and fun to play. I like the instant shuffle and the patterns. pretty graphics and great dragons make it attractive.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I have watched it several times I have bought the movie for myself and my friends as gifts....I have lent my copy to friends and everyone has enjoyed it.....I even went to see it on Broadway.....
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|This season dragged a little - I still haven't finished all the episodes.  I couldn't wait to watch the next episode in seasons 1 and 2.  Some of the drama is too predictable, maybe?
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I've had the rangefinder for a couple months and it has performed flawlessly.  However, I rated it at 4 stars because despite the description, this rangefinder does not use a 9 volt battery.  It uses the small more expensive  and harder to find 3 volt battery.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Great app for Kindle Fire HD. No issues so far, really enjoy watch SC2 where ever I have WiFi. Twitch FTW!!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|you cant wait to find out more next season, even though you didn't like some of the kill offs this past season
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game! it is a fun way to pass the time!  u should get this game u will lug it!
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Look, it's a Step Up Sequel.  If you like dancing, it is the best of the Step Up movies.  Amazing dance sequences and costumes.  If you are watching this movie for any other reason, you will be disappointed.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|If you like the doctor, you'll like this season. Matt Smith shines in his role as the doctor, and we get to ride along with the Ponds
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics and lots of movement.  It was a lot of fun to pay this game. We love our minions!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is a great CD.  Love Adele.  Her voice is so pure.  She does not need fanfare, technogadgets, voice altering devices to make her sound better.  Love it!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I was recommended to read this book by my Doctor, following a serious illness. It all rings so true to me and I am already looking forward to re-reading it.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|This is my second copy of this marvelous work. It is to be cherished, and, if copies are available, to be shared.
0446547638|5.0|I was not disappoijnted in this book. I have all of his books to date. I felt that this book was  very emotional in its content . Sometimes it reminded me of the story plot of one of his others, but was still strong in its message of love and loyalty to family.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Il Divo have no equals in what they do musically, and I think this is their best CD so far. It displays the strength of their individual voices much more fully than previous recordings.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|It's always good to see Bruce....great play up of retirees. I can't wait to see Red2.  This is a very good flick.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br />* adjustable weight<br />* good size, good ergonomics<br />* many aesthetic customizations (color, intensity, breathing speed)<br />* programmable macros<br />* 2 profiles<br /><br />Cons:<br />* didn't work well on one of my mouse pads, though I think it's the pad. I recall having had issues with another high DPI mouse<br />* I found the DPI button useless. Once I found the DPI I liked, I didn't switch. It's also not at a very reachable spot so reprogramming it isn't so great.<br /><br />I bought the first mouse for work. I broke my elbow, making it impossible to use the keyboard and the mouse simultaneously. I mostly needed the Ctrl and Alt shortcuts, though I also programmed copy and paste which turned out to be quite useful. So this can actually be used for work if you wanted to. There's a button at the bottom of the mouse that allows you to switch between 2 user-defined profiles, so you could even have a work profile and a gamer profile.<br />When my mouse at home broke a month later, I decided to buy the same one. I've gamed a bit with it, but I haven't taken the time to set a profile for gaming and I'm still used to using keyboard short keys. I have to admit though, I'm not a big gamer anymore. It is a nice mouse and I needed a new one.
B000088E6D|5.0|Can't say enough about his music!  Great for all ages because his music is wholesome, which is hard to find nowadays.  I've seen him live and am going in November.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Really good showing the weather. I hate the mPoints thing though. So freaking tedious. It really gets in the way of seeing the weather.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Great soundtrack.  It has a futuristic sound to it but if you have seen the movie you know that it fits it perfectly.  Listen to it at least once a week.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Fantastic movie. Good memories. The streaming version via Amazon Prime is not bad. It's a little strange though. Connection-wise, it's a little spotty. I have premium connection, but it took about 10-15 minutes before I was viewing in the higher definition.
B00CXQL828|5.0|This is such a great record. The band provides a perfect blend from straight up Rock N' Roll to Prog to Cool Ass catchy. I swear this is not a prog fanboy review. It's all about the music.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|loved the music and price. speedy dilervery. very positive experience and l look forword to future purchases. i am very happy.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I rate this book with 4*, it is kind of stories which I like the most.<br />You have to read it untill finished.<br />I have already read several books from Ken Follet.<br />I can recommend this book to everybody, who enjoys reading exciding and good written books.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It has been over a year since a book made me cry, maybe twelve since a book made me cry repeatedly. Even though it gripped me emotionally, it also gripped me historically. I am happy I read this well told story, and will be recommending this to peers and friends.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I am not sure if I like this book or not. I put it down and keep going back to it trying to finish it. I am hoping that it will start coming together. Maybe it is because it starts off jumping around. I don't know. Maybe if I finish it I will feel differently about it, but right now I don't look forward to picking it up again.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Jillian Micheals is the best & most knowledgeable when it comes to health & fitness in my option. The 30 day shred is awesome if you want to bust out an intense total body & cardio work out in 20 minutes. You will feel the results after doing the just level 1 so be prepared to be sore! This is my favorite video to work out to, simple to follow & you get results fast.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Great book. I'm just starting out and was cheaper on the kindle vs paperback. Pictures help the process and the pattern flow
1451695195|5.0|I liked the book because of the writers point of view. It had enough scientific information that a layman could understand, and still get the belief, and experiences of the writer across.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started game and I'm still confused and it is taking me awhile just figuring out what to do next. It could be more informative.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|what a movie that keeps you guessing and wondering whats coming next and how the<br /> just  us  system really works<br />there are some good lawyers and bad than there is Matthew macartney that really shows<br />you what can happen when you cross him it really is good and well worth it I hope they<br />come out with a part two it would be worth it for sure
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this era and it drew me in on the first episode. Watch story lines develop and enjoy all the escapades.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|now this movie is  a good one with comedy twist and some of the actors in it<br />well worth it on a day you have nothing going this is the movie for you,<br />and I can't wait till i get red 2 that i already have on order just waiting for release  of it
B000VSAEYI|2.0|WE PURCHASED THIS AFTER PLAYING IN ONE AT A FAMILY MEMBERS HOUSE. AFTER TWO USES IT GOT A HOLE SOMEWHERE AND WE CANT FIND IT
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Zip sleeve<br /><br />I really like the zip sleeve.  It fits perfectly and it is great for protection of my kindle
0770437400|4.0|In \\"World War Z\\" Max Brooks uses a Q&A format to create a 360 degree view of an \\"undead\\" outbreak and war. The survivors' stories cover every possible reaction to the zombies. There are the different military and government responses, the capitalists who take advantage of the situation with fake vaccines, and, of course, the Hollywood celebrities that turn their survival into a reality show.<br />Brooks does an excellent job of pairing the fictional zombie world with a realistic view of how our world responds to chaos. Each country's response to the undead matches with its current domestic and foreign policy. The medical community's response to the undead is similar to its actions after the outbreak of any new disease. The confusion and misinformation about the undead disease is reminiscent of the AIDS epidemic. The failure of traditional military responses relates to how terrorism could not be stopped with traditional warfare.  The majority of the book focuses on events in the United States. Most intriguing is how the U.S. almost loses the Zombie War because of its citizens' war weariness.  \\"This generation had had enough, and that's why when the undead began to devour our country, we were almost too weak and vulnerable to stop them. (p.50)\\" This quote from a U.S. survivor is the best example of how Brooks uses reality as a foundation for every survivor story.<br />As any apocalyptic story, \\"World War Z\\" includes the message of hope and survival. By setting the interviews after the war is won, Brooks is able to carry this message throughout the book.  The survivors may have dark tales to tell but they have survived to share them.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game but would be really cool if halfbrick add some more spin token prizes like you get a run where the whole fly area is filled with tokens or something like that.
0307236722|5.0|This book is a must for any baker.  I purchased it along with another &#34;newer&#34; generation cookbook for my daughter and she by far &#34;loves &#34; this book!
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|The cat has made my whole family laugh.  It is a unique program that allows you to hear your voice changed, recorded and ready for playback. A great app for my Kindle.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|the megalodon is the best he can swallow boats and eat jellyfish the great white riding eat everything the megalodon does!
1601251831|5.0|I can not say how much I always love What Paizo Did with the game I love.  Alto better then the shepards who have it now.  The beastiary is full of not only stats, but also suggestions on how to use them as well as a guide for building a monster from scratch. I have been dming since TSR and let me tell you The Bestieary reminds me of the old ADD Monster manuals.
B0015AARJI|3.0|This should've been way cheaper being the PS4 was right around the corner. it also feels like it was made a little cheaper then they were when PS3 was first released. All in all another high end product made with poor materials or assembled poorly or both but its still better then a knock off brand.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superb acting, incredible attention to detail. Fascinating story line -- first rate! So impressive and beautifully filmed.<br />A heart endorsement for any viewer of period pieces.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for all ages . Kids love it even toddlers love it . Every time I babysit they ask for me to let them play subway surfers.
B00CMQX84A|3.0|I haven't seen a Disney movie in quite some time (Pixar doesn't count) and the old beach movies of the 60s were fun. I thought I'd get a kick out of Teen Beach Movie; especially since it is spoofing those movies. Female teen surfer, McKenzie (Mack) and her boyfriend Brady (who is a big fan of the 60's beach film \\"Wet Side Story\\" are transported to said movie while riding the `big' wave and with the help of a special surfboard. Due to their interference, they change the storyline of the movie and might not be able to get back to their own world and time.<br /><br />I love spoofs and enjoyed this more than I should. It bikers vs. surfers over who gets to hang out at the local hangout and the film leads fall in love with the transported teens. There is also a crazy scientist bent on taking over the whole beach. Yes, there is overacting, and some silly songs, but overall I found it to be good family fun. It even got a chuckle or two from my wife.<br /><br />Would I watch it again? Probably not. Nor would I see a sequel or buy the soundtrack. I think it would be difficult for Disney to franchise this, although I could see them making as play out of it.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I loved this movie for its plot twists and unexpected handling of some very emotional happenings.  Both main characters were awesome and so believable.  I work with adults with mental illness and this movie accurately portrayed the ups and downs with struggles on medication side effects!
0062255657|2.0|A middle aged man returns to his childhood home and is drawn to a farm done the end of the road. It opens up memories long hidden.<br /><br />The story intrigued me to want and read it. I was captivated by the first chapter, but after that I found it to be stretched out as though a short story trying to fill a full book. The more I read the more I had the feeling that this was a story for child and not an adult one as advertised. It is not a coming of age story but when much more a fairytale. I wanted to get into it and although it has gotten many rave reviews, I didn't get what other people did.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was hooked after the first few pages.  My daughter told me to read the first chapter and if I didn't like it, I could quit.  I started reading on my phone.  Big mistake.  I read most of the first book on my phone since I didn't have my Kindle Fire with me.  I hate to read for long on my phone but I couldn't put it down.  I thought the first book was excellent--although horrifying--but the second dragged a bit.  The third one was good, not as good as the first, but I liked it and thought the ending was satisfying.  I don't understand why this is supposed to be a children's book.  It's a pretty horrifying concept for a child to read.  But I don't have kids that age so maybe that's the sort of thing they like.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a parent I was immediately drawn into the complexity and underlying sadness of this book.  A very good read.
B00005JKN9|5.0|After watching this movie, I can understand why it won so many awards. Leo C. can be very proud of his performance, and D.D. Lewis outperformed himself in his role as Bill The Butcher.
B007HACDLK|3.0|O'Reilly praise got me to buy  book never really took off  never anxious to get back to reading it.  Almost finished and it did get better after 60% mark.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A perspective not  commonly talked about, Outliers makes you realize that many differences and inequality is attributable to luck. As such it makes the world seem like it should be a fairer place that would motivate all to help the unlucky.
1781162646|5.0|As a big Stephen King fan, I found this an easy, quick read that kept me engaged.  Could a movie follow?
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As I begun reading this third book by Khaled I thought he missed the mark this time. I was wrong. As I continued my read, I became captivated by Khaled's weave of the story. I am an older all American male, with no love of Afghanistan or of the Middle Eastern countries, but no dislike either, and I find Khalid's books to be truly enlightening and attention keeping. I would RECCOMMEND all three of his books to anyone over the age of ten.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great music from some good &#34;ole&#34; guys. Easy listening and some sing-a-longs too.  Old voices have mellowed over the years.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I liked this movie better the second time the first time I saw it in the theater.  I can't wait for Avengers 2
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I bought Lost seasons 1, 5 and 6 all through Amazon.  All appeared to look as if they were new although I bought them as used so I'm happy about that.  Only issue I can see was that the box these were shipped in was too big and had no insulation in them to keep them from shuffling around.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am reading this after having read the &#34;Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight&#34; cookbook. A little backwards, but the cookbook gives a great synopsis of the information in the &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; book.  But I wanted to investigate this further and purchased the Kindle version of &#34;Wheat Belly&#34;.<br /><br />This is truly scary information about how wheat products currently available to us in stores as bread, cakes, cookies, and other products are being made with GMO wheat, which is highly addictive.  No wonder we can sit down and eat slice after slice of bread, or other wheat products, including our breakfast cereal, and be in a near stupor the rest of the day.  I thought I was eating very healthy by having cereal with 13 grams of fiber every morning with skim milk.  And then have to take a nap within an hour or two after breakfast.  No wonder!  This book explains it all.  I feel so much better avoiding wheat products, and the other GMO grains, such as oat, rice, and soy.<br /><br />The cookbook is great because there are recipes to make your own bread, pizza crust, cupcakes, etc.  In the Milwaukee, WI. area, there is a bakery, Angelic Bakehouse, that does make bread, dinner rolls, hot dog and hamburger buns with non-GMO grains.  The 7-grain bread is fantastic.  Angelic Bakehouse, out of Waukesha, Wi,  also sells their products online.  But, in any case, Dr. Davis's information is so valuable.  Thank you, Dr. Davis, for making this information available to the public!

B00DU74U74|5.0|I don't believe in aliens but this movie was real good.  This movie shows what love and determination can achieve.
B004GYY714|4.0|I use this app a lot, especially when I travel. It really is the local radio station and not just random music.<br /><br />Some radio stations are not able to be played at certain times. I assume this is due to paid programming (ie Bob and Tom Show, etc) where the radio station subscribes to a program. This is frustrating, but I understand the issue. I would think that there would be a way around it because the you can listen to the radio free from that town, why not listen to it free from further away.<br /><br />I did find that if you listen to an actual radio and listen to TuneIn, they do not match up. There must be some delay before it get's to TuneIn. This delay is not 1 or 2 seconds but possibly minutes or several songs.<br /><br />It's still a great app and I use it.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Well written.  An updated version should be very helpful to today's young people and those over 45 who expect to work into their 80's.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this app, but it's very addicting. The levels seem to be very easy or impossible, but that's just how this game is. . . you either see the pattern or you don't.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|The game is fun tasks are fast. better than I thought it would be. It's worth a try and its free.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I missed the tv series, so I thought I'd better read the book as all my friends were talking about it. I certainly wasn't disappointed! Loved the characters, the plot and all the twists. Looking forward to the Book Two..<br />Well worth the read.

0062200909|5.0|I love concept art collections and anything that sheds light on the artistic process of those who make great things - this book is no exception.<br /><br />From the sketches of the weapons to the mockups of the different characters (One of Thror's concept beards was plated and looked very, very cool - but they went with the more regal concept for the movie... I hope they show the plated one on a dwarf in one of the next movies), down to just HOW they did the mockups for the characters, very inspiring and enlightening.<br /><br />That all being said, I can spend a couple hours just staring at concept images of sprawling complex caverns and that sort of thing, so of course I love this book.

1616550414|5.0|I love concept art books, and I love the Legend of Zelda - so this is a no brainer. I love seeing the thoughts that come out in sketches, hints at the origins of character design decisions - and this book is just packed with that.<br /><br />The cover is gorgeous, the pages are thick and glossy - this is a book to buy right freakin now. If you're even reading reviews on it, you're mildly interested for yourself or for a gift - for the love of all that is holy just buy the book, you or whomever you're buying it for will absolutely be glad you did.

0307950654|1.0|This was a major disappointment. But I can't say why I expected otherwise. Anyone trying to imitate Jane Austen's voice will inevitably fail--and fail miserably. But what was most irritating was the rote retelling of the details of Pride and Prejudice, the complete lack of any expansion on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth and, most egregiously, a completely boring and uncompelling murder \\"mystery.\\"<br />Oh pass, dear reader. Pass on this!
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|I love the Outlander series and the Lord John stories.  However, this book was a big disappointment.  I ordered it through my Kindle, not realizing it was in comic book style.  It didn't fit my Kindle well, the words were to small to read, enlarging the print made it harder to read on the Kindle.  If I'd know the book was a comic book, I would never have bought it.  I wish I could get my money back.  I can't wait until her next book comes out, I just hope it isn't in the same form.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book is so worth every minute. There is so much many can learn from it.<br /><br />I am speechless, totally awesome, LOVE IT!!!!!!!
0375869026|5.0|I'm late to the Wonder party, but I'm so glad I still came. This book is fantastic! I had heard that it was great, and I was happy to see it on the Texas Bluebonnet List.<br /><br />Told from various points of view, readers take a journey with ten-year-old Auggie (real name August) as he journeys to school for the first time. Born with facial disfigurement, Auggie is prepared for people to stare at him, but school turns out to be harder than expected---not just for Auggie but for his family and friends.<br /><br />What I find amazing is that the author captures so many different characters perfectly: their voice, their feelings, their background. Each character is unique and adds to Auggie's story while telling their own.<br /><br />Add them all together, and you get a beautiful story of friendship and triumph and, most of all, acceptance.<br /><br />I'm going to promote this book heavily at school this coming year and encourage teachers to use it in their classrooms. The book's theme of choosing to be kind is one that is much needed in today's society for both the young and the old, and Palacio shares that lesson in a thought-provoking, wonderful way.

B005KELW26|5.0|This folio adequately protects my Kindle Fire and is very portable.  It is worth the price compared to other choices.
B00821OX98|3.0|Though I suppose could be considered the continuing story of War of the Worlds, it's a lot like the Walking Dead meets Jericho.  Pretty good story...starting to get into it more after 5-6 episodes.  There are so many characters and it takes a little time to develop all of them.  CGI is sketchy... hard to say on film quality as I am streaming from Wii WiFi and the signal MAY be affecting the picture quality.<br /><br />Over all it seems pretty good...will update if needed.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Much different than other forms of Tarot cards. They tend to make you feel positive about the possibilities and that maybe you that you do have some guardian angels watching out for you. I have found that the readings have really made me think about situations in my life rather than just letting them pass by on their own. You might say that the readings have produced some thought provoking ideas that have taken wings and flown to greater heights.

B00C25TCZ0|5.0|I was searching through amazon for the new Jason Newsted music and came across Black Star Riders. I listened to a couple of samples of the album and thought \\"Man. I really like this\\" then I listened to a few more songs and thought \\"that sort of reminds me of Thin Lizzy\\" I then did a little research and found out that the guitarist played with Thin Lizzy and the drummer played with Megadeath. What more could you ask for? I ordered the CD and recieved it today. After listening to it, I was really impressed. This is a GREAT album. It has been a very long time since I heard any music that I enjoyed as much as my old reliables (Sabbath, Van Halen, Sweet, DIO) I hope Black Star Riders keep on making music. Love it!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm 21 years old and Love the chromecast<br /><br />I had it for a little over a day now. I got to say I love using YouTube and Netflix on this device. Before I would have to connect my chromebook to my Monitor just to see YouTube in a bigger screen, and the quality was horrible.<br /><br />I can plug this Item into a computer monitor or even a TV (Any HDMI input device). It has clear HD (1080p) when watching Play Movies and Netflix, as well as HD YouTube videos.<br /><br />If you have your living room media center set up correctly you can watch your chromecast videos using your stereo! Surround sound for me!<br /><br />The only problem with it is that it has no password to use it. Anyone in your home (Siblings, parents) can hijack the feed and start a different video.<br /><br />I heard streaming a chrome tab requites a good PC, I've tried it on the Chromebook and it wasn't very good. So I will need to get my brother to bring his good laptop and try it.<br /><br />I WILL UPDATE WHEN AND WHERE NEEDED

0783225725|5.0|Clint Eastwood is a great movies to watch.  We like westerns very much.  For the price as well this was a great buy.
B00D5TASN2|4.0|2nd solo album from this uniquely talented artist--eccentric & haunted, deconstructed<br />  atmospheric blues cries in the midst of some drug-hazed, existential song-soundwave<br />  surrealism.  It's as if the dreamy nature of true peculiarity was reborn as twisted Americana<br />  storytelling, touched by the hand of electronic plague, and swallowed by the opiate sensuality of<br />  a random, undulating desert.  What else would you expect from the creator of \\"Eraserhead\\" and<br />  \\"Blue Velvet\\"?  For me, it's not quite as compelling as 2011's \\"Crazy Clown Time\\", but still a<br />  creepy-strange and rewarding moment-in-time for open-eared listeners.
B00319ECGU|5.0|Clint Eastwood is a great movies to watch.  We like westerns very much.  For the price as well this was a great buy.
B00BMTX5XM|4.0|Debut album from English band--gentle, beautiful & brooding, expansive & explosive celestial<br />  soft-core electronic swoon-pop, powered by heart-grippingly fragile female vocals that some-<br />  times seem to carry an extraordinary emotional weight.  Both lyrics and music take occasional<br />  dark turns, adding a sort of drama and slow-building, passionate tension as they ebb and flow<br />  from sensual resignation to a determined, almost fierce, strength.  Recalls artists such as<br />  Exitmusic, The Twilight Sad, Beach House, Cat Power, This Mortal Coil, Bjork, EMA.  This one<br />  feels like a grower; a subtly potent squeeze of eerie, dark beauty.
B009KNPPS0|5.0|my husband loves it it was a gift and he plays it all the time.  We go to his concerts when he comes and they are most enjoyable.
B00D28TNT6|3.0|3rd album from Bristol, England duo is a barrage of high energy, controlled electronic attack<br />  music that mixes edgy elements of chaos with rhythmic structure and widescreen, aggressive<br />  melodic flow.  Synthesizer sounds float & snap, soar & roar, bleep & rumble--mixing alien<br />  warmth and hipster distortion in a giant planet-vat of bigger-than-life, digital audio futurism.  It's<br />  the sound of cold, brittle technology; adeptly assimilated and grandly stretched by the artists'<br />  concept of environmental necessity.  Initially fascinating, but not a place I want to stay too long.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I would most definitely Recommend. The hidden objects were challenging and fun. Some of the puzzles were difficult but gives the option to skip.

B00D5YNQMW|4.0|First off, I own a few hundred concert dvd's.  I've seen it all.  I don't like what many people don't like - too many rapidly changing camera angles, incomplete songs, etc.  This concert video has some of that.  Incomplete songs are unusual for a concert dvd and I'm not sure why Aerosmith did this for the Rising Sun video.  Some songs actually began already a minute or two into them.  Strange but it is what it is.  The glass, however, is way more than half full in my opinion.  First off, most of the songs in the concert video are complete.  More than that, the entire band thoroughly enjoyed themselves and put in a very spirited and passionate performance.  The songs weren't (thankfully) played by the numbers.  Instead, there were imaginative passages within the songs and many were extended, including longer jams and solos.  Many concert videos are doctored and fixed.  Pay attention to Steven Tyler's vocals.  His vocals were amazing.  No doctoring here.  I cannot believe a 60-something can sing that consistently and well from beginning to end of a concert.  He sang better here than he did at his peak of performing in the 70's.  After seeing this concert, I was not bothered that much by the short interviews in between songs because the performance of those songs played blew me away at times and exceeded my fairly high expectations.  So, for those who want a complete concert without interruption, be grateful for what you did get - one of their more old school set lists played with immediacy and purpose.  These guys still care a lot and obviously hold themselves to lofty standards as far as their concert performances.  As far as the audio and video goes, the audio was very good.  The video did, at certain times, have flourishes of way too many camera angle changes but there were a lot of extended shots as well.  There were many times during many songs when the cameras were about as relaxed as you can get for a concert video.  Picture quality for Rising Sun was above average compared to other blu-ray concert dvd's that I own.  It is, without a doubt, worth purchasing.

140006922X|3.0|I had a couple problems with it. Mainly, the lack of footnotes REALLY bothered me. I felt it patronizing, as if I were deemed  intellectually lazy or would just take the author's word for it. Trust me, he seemed to say. But what and how much was speculation on the author's part? Yes, the source list at the end was impressive, granted, but i am not going to read them all to find what I wanted to know. I just would have been much more satisfied with footnotes to refer to. Particularly in that the entire book is based upon a controversial premise, that all the gospels were written at such a late date. From that premise, he concludes that Jesus was not at all the peace loving, nonviolent man we've all thought, that he was portrayed as such by the gospel writers to placate the Romans after the destruction of Jerusalem. Didn't convince me. That being said, there is much of interest. I enjoyed reading about Paul's role in the early church. I also am fascinated by the Essenes and they were mentioned, albeit briefly, in the book.<br />I admit, I purchased this mainly to spite Faux news and see what the hoopla was about. I was initially excited, but it's okay, just okay.
159562015X|1.0|First, let me say that I am Me. I am an independent thinker. I am not a democrat, a republican, or an independent. I realize NPR tends to be liberal, but I also find significant amounts of accurate reporting from my local NPR station. I believe in the idea of individual responsibility. If I want a better life, it's up to me to make it so.<br /><br />About this book.<br />Shame on Gallup for using self-improvement as an excuse to gather demographic data and try to fit everyone into demographic 'groups'. That is all this test does. It gives Gallup all the liberal data they need to paint everyone into demographic groups.<br /><br />Here's how they are doing it:<br /><br />1) The first thing Gallup does is ask about you, under the guise that they are required by law to ask. What is your color, gender, location, etc?<br /><br />Boom, you belong to a 'group'.<br /><br />2) Next they tell you that for all of the questions, you must rate how much you agree with the statements presented.<br /><br />The problem is that they don't just say something like: \\"I strive to be responsible\\", and let you agree or disagree. Instead they pit \\"I strive to be responsible\\" against another statement like \\"I treat everyone the same, regardless of their color.\\" Now you have to choose which one you agree with more. What if I am both? Or neither? It's feelings vs. logic, as if you can't have both. This makes no sense, right?<br /><br />It makes sense if you look at Gallup's goals:<br />A) Identify and pool everyone into demographic groups, white males, black males, females, latino males, etc.<br />B) Determine how each of these 'groups' think when they have to choose only between a liberal concept vs. a conservative one. They may as well cut to the chase and ask: 'Which do you agree completely with, Keynesian or Classical Economic theory?'<br /><br />In the example above, Gallup is attempting to determine if my group's desire to be fair (i.e. to be politically correct) is more important than mydesire to be responsible.<br />Why don't they just ask one question? \\"Are you a democrat or a republican?\\" Probably because of people like me, who don't paint themselves into political corners. They are trying to corral everyone into their little 'groups'. Like good democrats always do. What happened to the individual?<br /><br />The tight controls on the test confirm my theory.<br /><br />There is good reason for all of the controls on the test.<br /><br />1) You have to buy the book to get the code to register.<br />2) You have to register by name, location, gender, color, etc.<br />3) You have only 20 seconds to answer each question.<br />4) You cannot go back.<br />5) You can only take the test once.<br /><br />This is a controlled study. The feedback was just regurgitated input. A waste of time.<br />And the worst part? They want you to pay your hard earned dough to contribute data to their cause.<br />Again, shame on you, Gallup.<br /><br />Do you want to improve your life?<br />Don't waste your money on this book. Here's all you need to do.<br /><br />1) Be confident in yourself.<br />2) Find someone honest that you trust.<br />3) Ask them how you can improve.<br />4) Save $ and get real answers about the individual known as You.

B004X4R49Y|4.0|I think this product rates 4 1/2 to 5 stars.  I hesitated to say &#34;5 stars&#34; more because of my own quirks than any in the movie.  I considered it a wonderful movie.  There was something about trying to make it be all things to all people that caused me pause.  There seemed something for children, but not enough; something for young adults, but not enough; and something for seniors, but it was dispersed.  Any presence of Hitler is disgusting to me; yet he had to make an appearance.  Plus, trying to rate a movie that you know professionals have already deemed &#34;Best Picture&#34; sets you up for a fall.  Let me explain.<br /><br />The acting was great, I thought.  Costumes were very good, but not great.  I thought the Duchess of York should have been more spiffy than she appeared.<br /><br />The King's Speech was a story about how a man who became king had been frustrated with a speech impediment for most of his life.  He had two brothers.  The living one was a living hell, who taunted the one with the speech impediment (Bertie -- The Duke of York, or King George VI, who was forced into &#34;kinging&#34; when his taunter decided to have an affair and later marriage to a commoner).  The other brother died as a child because of complications from epilepsy, I believe.  The Duke's wife showed caring early in the movie, looking anxiously on as her husband tried to carry out duties that required speaking.  And what must a stammering king do?  Where can he go to hide when all eyes are on him?  At least, until the owner of the eyes is too embarrassed for the person to look.  Meanwhile, the father King George V, reigning over a quarter of the world's people, tried to show concern by making demands on his stammering son.  This made matters worse.  Even an orator might stammer under those circumstances!<br /><br />The Duchess took it upon herself to seek help for her husband.  She sought out someone recommended for the job, the inimitable doctor Lionel.  Lionel was, tome, even more of a support than the wife.  For Lionel was not kin.  He simply acted the part.  In the movie.  And act he did.  His resolve and concern were models for anyone attempting to be therapist or friend.  He showed no concern for title or tradition, at one point taking a seat in the king's chair (throne?) at Westminster Abbey and looping his leg over an arm.<br /><br />Stammering is a major theme in the movie, as a number of people were affected by the disorder.  Even Winston Churchill admitted to having problems earlier.  Those who interacted with Lionel, the doctor with no credentials save helping war veterans, were made the better for it.  Better Lionel than the doctor who advised Bertie to place seven  marbles in his mouth and speak.  Demosthenes did it?  Good for him.  For Lionel's part, he spat them out and asked the duchess to promise him &#34;no more!&#34;<br /><br />As for the voice lessons, there was great tension.  From the ragged wallpaper to the capacious room to Lionel's fierce unyielding to tradition to the sheer emotional and physical stress of tttttt-trying to speak, the viewer got inside the character's heads.  Bertie said that his father had told someone that he (Bertie) had more &#34;guts than the rest of his brothers.&#34;  The tension goes on and on, with Lionel acting as if he were king over Bertie and Bertie's resisting with a series of curses:  f---!  f---!  f---!  Those are four-letter words, by the way, and provided much comic relief, as well as the ability to speak without stammering.  Also, music helped to assuage tension and perhaps deaden the brain to stutters.  Lionel used all of these until it was finally time.<br /><br />Bertie could hide no more.  With his father dead, his brother David's giving up his inherited kinging position, Hitler's trying to take over the world, his hours and hours of practice, Bertie had to face the truth.  He was king and it was incumbent upon him to tell the world it would not submit to Hitler's hellish demands.  He could not just think these thoughts.  He had to say them.  And he had to say it the way kings do.  He had to deliver the goods:  The King's Speech.  Frightened until the last few seconds before broadcast, Bertie breathed, danced in his head, had Lionel curse for him and cajole him and literally wrap him in a cocoon of caring, of friendship, and some of the best love since Christianity's Saviour.  And he delivered.  Bertie, aka King George VI, gave one hell of an excellent speech!!!<br /><br />The only thing lacking for me was the duchess's wardrobe.  But that's just me.  The Academy already said this was Best Picture.  I said the movie was about the power of friendship.  And I have seldom seen it portrayed so brilliantly.  For that, five stars!

B00E193TM2|3.0|Ok first off a quick review.  I've been listening to this album for a few days now and it's definately not as good as the first 2 albums.  Having said that, there are a few standout tracks to get your blood pumping.  \\"Lift Me Up\\" is such a motivating tune and has that early 5FDP feel to it, and Rob Halford is just icing on the cake to an already great song. I would like to note the striking similarities in the verse structure of this song and Ozzy's \\"Ultimate Sin\\".<br /><br />\\"Watch You Bleed\\" is another stand out with a great acoustic intro which then builds into a catchy and heavy tune.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Anywhere but Here\\" is a really great tune featuring Maria Brink from In This Moment.  I love this track but make sure you're listening to the 2nd version which is a full blown duet, not the first version which only features Maria after the bridge.<br /><br />The rest of the songs seem like throwaway tracks to me.  Maybe they'll grow on me though.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />Now to clear up the confusion over which version you're getting from Amazon MP3.  I originally ordered the clean version thinking it wasn't edited because it doesn't state that it's clean anywhere in the description.  Amazon gave me a refund though and I was able to find the explicit version and promptly downloaded it.  Links to the correct versions are below:<br /><br />Clean: [[ASIN:B00E1942VO B00E1942VO]]<br /><br />Explicit: [[ASIN:B00E193TM2 B00E193TM2]]

B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I have always been a big fan of Sci-Fi movies and there are some great ones out there.<br />This movie started well but ended up with clunky movement foreward and little convincing<br />drama, often confusing building up leading to nothing.  Cruise has made some great<br />movies.  I wish that this had been one of them.  Visuals were nice so on a big screen<br />there were nice visual moments.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nikola Tesla was a man ahead of his time.  His ideas were stolen and hidden from the public by deceitful and corrupt people.  The world would have been a better place if his inventions were used for the betterment of mankind.
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|I'm a big Chimaira fan and this ranks up there with some of their best work.  Would highly recommend a listen.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|This has helped to be able to learn many things through reading free ebooks.  It is a great resouce which I hope will continue to serve the public.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|nicely done!  a taste of future of movies... reminds you of your childhood if you are from Europe specially...<br />four stars are well deserved.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love playing Mahjong on my Tablet.  I get so engrossed in matching pieces, that the time just flies by.  The games helps me differentiate slight differences in matching the tiles.  Why is this useful in life?  I think it helps me recognize and gives me awareness of differences in people, nature, animals.  It's helpful if you like to paint (art), or if you work dealing with people (police).  It's just fun playing the game.
1781162646|4.0|I had read many reviews saying Joyland was boring, not really a horror novel, and was really just the story of Devin Jones Summer and Autumn working at Joyland Amusement Park in Heaven's Bay, North Carolina.  So I went in knowing it wasn't going to be like King's normal horror doorstoppers like It, Carrie, or The Shining.  But once I accepted it for what it was and not what the publishers and author hyped the book up to be...which by the way on the cover it said that Joyland was a hard boiled horror.  I can say it is not hard boiled and not a horror.  There was a mystery but not really any horror.  Anyway like I was saying, once I understood what I was really reading I just enjoyed King's storytelling.  I think because King has such a reputation and readers have expectations of what his books are like that this book did generate negative reviews.  But maybe we, as readers, forget that even big time famous authors can be great storytellers and they don't have to always have to follow their famous story formulas.  So no this wasn't was it was hyped up to be but I did enjoy it for what it was...a good story.  The characters were well written, the different plotlines were woven together seamlessly to create a good novel, and he shows readers things rather then tell us...which King had ample opportunity to do so with describing the sights, sounds, and smells of not only an amusement park but the beach.  I loved learning the \\"Carny Talk\\".  All of the code words for the customers, rides, booths, and games made the novel fun.  King certainly did his research well in that area.<br /><br />My advice is to take this for what it is, ignore what it is advertised as, and enjoy a good story.  There are plenty of Stephen King's standards out there for readers to enjoy and I think this just shows how versatile his writing can be.  Great story.  4 stars.
B0028IDXDS|3.0|My son love love loves his monkey pacifier.. I wish it would have a snap connection instead of being sewn onto the plush toy.. if the pacifer gets ruined, it would make more sense to just unsnap n connect a new one. I think it would be more worth the money that way aswell
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game was one thata our grandson wanted, so we let him order it for our Kindle. He loves it, but  we do not play it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I gust love this game for 2 reason . Fist I play it even time I can  .And I gust love to play it
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|Our younger grandaughter wanted this game, so I let her put it on my Kindle.I, personally do not like it, but she does.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love the story line. Love playing on the kindle because I can enlarge the hidden object scenes. Great game. Thanks.
1401937268|5.0|I love cards by Doreen Virtue!  They are beautiful and spot on!  I want to buy more decks and have already given 2 as gifts!!  I have also preordered a new one coming in November!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This was a warm and reassuring film.  Anyone who enjoys the postwar holiday classics (It's a Wonderful Life, Christmas in Connecticut, White Christmas, etc.) will find this entertaining. I found the plot twist at the end to be quite unexpected, but a very satisfactory resolution indeed.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Oddly, this show is interesting and you wait to see what happens next.  I usually turn away from 'blood' type of movies but this one is catchy.
0812550706|4.0|I absolutely and abundantly recommend this book.  Before I read the book I was a little leery of reading about a 6-15 year old boy.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my worries unfounded.  Ender's childhood is sad and it forces him to deal with issues many adults have trouble dealing with.  At the end, the fate of the human species rests on the shoulders of an unassuming teenager.<br /><br />I hope the future novels add a romance ark between Ender and Valentine;  Though I realize that might be too much for some people, especially in the 1980s when it was first published.  Read the book and you may understand why.  I look forward to seeing the movie too.
B00D7JGL36|3.0|Vince is true country music. I think country music sold it's soul and totally lost all respect. Most of todays country music is nothing more then really corny pop music. But, it's so nice to know that Vince is staying true to his country roots. Vince Gill is still outstanding! If you enjoy real country music then you will enjoy this.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Sound is as goood as example sennheiser, and in games working very good. can use nokia lumia for music too.
B005UG542S|5.0|Great i love it good movie but sad I love it you should buy it great buy and exquisite details in the movie
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Many Sci-fi/Fantasy books follow a similar pattern.  A child has a special ability, and with hard work and guidance, s/he can go out there and be someone special.  This book follows that pattern.  For the most part, the pattern has become boring.  So why am I giving this book 5 stars?<br /><br />Blood Song is well told.  From the moment Vaelin Al Sorna's father abandons him at the order, I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen to Vaelin next.  The story is told in a way that had me nervous/sad/happy for Vaelin.  I don't want to give specifics because I don't want to give any of the story away.  But please trust me when I say this author knows how to build up suspense.  The detail in this book is incredible.  Anthony Ryan figured out how to paint a picture and not lose the reader in the details.  I only hope that the coming additions match up to this book.<br /><br />Blood Song is a good deal at any price.<br /><br />If you like Blood Song, you might also like the Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks (Also follows the pattern in a compelling way).
B000G73UEU|5.0|The brilliance and depth of this man is astounding.  Each word/phrase/tone penetrates a place that is so deep.  The artists selected for the performance excel in every way - like they were hand picked from beyond all of us.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought this game for my son.  He loved it and i could barley get him off his kindle. Even my 12 year old daughter loved it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My granddaughter loved this movie! It was full of action and a heartfealt story related to Ralph. Wreck it Ralph!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five stars long but awesome recommending to ANYONE at all I loved it a book to truly anyone and enjoy!
B007URVZJ6|1.0|What's the point of using kindle if it's only for English. This service is mature by now and it should be including Greek already
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Glad it wasn't as mundane early on as some of his books.  A little confusing at the end. Guess will find out in his next novel.  All in all, was a good read.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I had it on Kindle, so have no idea how long it is.  Like all Stephen King books, it kept me reading for hours at a time.  Anymore, that is saying a lot!
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Haven't seen the movie, will now ! This book really help me understand the nuances of baseball and now I have a better appreciation for the sport.  In it's own way it give the reader an insight to how baseball is played.  If you enjoy sports and weren't a fan of baseball you will be after reading this book
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|but price was way to dear seen it at my local dvd store for 16:00 dollars 40 anniversery one and i said what cant believe i paid double the price plus postage not happy at all with amzon:(
B005BZQS1E|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favourites. It has swearing, marijuana and plenty of tits, which is something you don't find much in a movie that takes place in the middle ages! James Franco makes a hilarious performance as usual, Danny McBride makes me laugh really hard and Natalie Portman is as hot as ever. Definetely worth a couple hours of your time to watch this movie.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Just what I needed for a night of entertainment at home!  Fun to see some of the older actors I grew up watching!
8866135887|2.0|I guess I should have done more research.......it is not quite what I had expected in both quality and size and staples had it on sale for 5.00 less.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great connection between the first and second book! Develop new favorite characters and gain background on some of the old ones.
B00821OX98|3.0|It's OK sort of like the Battle-star Gallactica feel to it. Slow moving not a lot of action with the aliens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun you travel around the world and it gets really addictive too :) you cant find a other game that is so much fun as subway surfers
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This album is obviously, surprisingly and absolutely the best rap album of the year. Like J. Cole's first album, he goes to a very deeper level and brings back the true meaning of hip-hop through his self-produced beats, his lyrical content and great collaborations. This sophomore is a very complete effort that leaves you hooked. All of his songs on the album basically have meaning, explaining themes of love, the differences of poverty and wealth and racial issues. This is indeed an album every hip-hop lover must buy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just fun is all I can say! Fun to get all the bananas and to try to stay on the path without running into things!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's been at least 7 years since Justin Timberlake made a comeback -- not only is this album surprising to the most, it's very soothing, fun, sexy, classy and mature coming from a pop star in a boy band. I guess many people dislike it if I compare this to the album... Blurred Lines... but to be frank... I really could care less. Most people say that Robin Thicke's album is the most preferable but ironically, it's not. Justin Timberlake's album is filled with a craze of lengthy, catchy and smooth songs.<br /><br />All of the songs are mostly highlights and it's hard to choose just one favorite out of them all. Songs like Pusher Love Girl, Strawberry Bubblegum, Tunnel Vision, Suit and Tie, Mirrors, Let the Groove Get In Spaceship Coupe definitely lift the album up to a great success. The album is definitely a go-get, and the anticipation of the second part of this album is evolving.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD of Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits is a great combination of their very best work.  The compilation is a great mix and go together very well.  So happy with it!
B009AMAJVO|3.0|The name of the movie leads you to look for more then is delivered.Not very exciting,doesn't hold your attention  Not a seat grabber.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I check weather forecasting here first thing every morning. It helps me plan my day, especially during the monsoon season.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great guys perspective, more books should be write from a mans view!!  I would definitely recommend this book to fellow reads.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This DVD came in perfect condition. There were no scratches or anything. The DVD case was even in good condition.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I weakly enjoyed reading this book. U also seen the movie and they were both great! But the books are always better :)
B0098460O4|4.0|Good sound and no scratches. I like it.<br />They make a great team and sound great together glad I bought it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I will be so sad when all of the Tolkein books are done being made into movies. Wish they would also do the Silmarilian.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Game is fun like the different levels and scenes.  The puzzles are simple yet challenging. Send more levels and harder challenges.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I had read it in high school a long time ago. We are planing a trip to Amsterdam so I thought I'd read it again. I had forgotten so much. When i was reading the book I had to remind myself this was not written by an adult &#34;writer&#34;. It is so well written for someone so young.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Clever, rapport between two main characters, interesting story lines. It's easy to watch while I'm working out. I look forward to more seasons
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love Despicable Me 1 and 2.  The game is really fun to and I really like it. You can play it in the car and without Internet.:
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I have a Vizio CN15-A5 notebook computer that had strange looking screws holding it together. I found out that they required a T5 torx screwdriver. I went searching for a screwdriver and eventually found this kit with good reviews and I knew the \\"iFixit\\" name pretty well so I had to give it a shot. I was amazed by the quality of the product and I plan on keeping the kit in my office for a long long time.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I wasn't interested in what I thought would be a child's movie, until a friend raved about it. Then I had to see for myself, and so glad I watched it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The actors, the characters, the setting, the costumes, the story, the accent.  Love it all.  Can't wait for season 4!
B00130UFY2|4.0|There wasn't a slow period at all in the movie. I sure hope this wasn't taken from a real-life event
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get this game it is so worth it at first it might lag but then it wont I enjoyed every little bit of this game :)
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Anker external batteries and always impressed with their quality and 18-months warranty. Another great thing about these - constant refresh with updated design and increased capacity. Battery cells are slimming down, efficiency of capacity improving, and I'm glad Anker keeps up with all these changes. Slim line is very unique since it offers one of the thinnest available external batteries with a built in usb cable/connector and a very decent capacity! In comparison to Slim2, this one increased a little bit in length and weight, but still at 134 mm x 70 mm x 12 mm and 155g of weight - it's super slim and portable to carry it with you in a pocket. The battery case itself is very sturdy, feels no flex, and with a matte finish and rubber material around the edge perimeter - makes it very comfortable to hold. Charging input of the battery is micro-usb port which also serves as a storage for one of the outputs with an attached cable and micro-usb connector. In addition, there is full usb port output. The input is rated at 0.8A which means it will take about 6-7 hours to fully charge this battery from empty, while both of the output ports are rated at 1A each which means you will get a full charging speed from those. And while you are charging the battery, or using it to charge your device, you have 4 leds indicating battery capacity in increments of 25%. I also would like to mention that although built-in cable with micro-usb connector is great and means one less cable to worry about, the connector itself is kind of thick and might not work with every case. That's where the 2nd full size usb charging port comes in very handy!<br /><br />The performance of this battery was really impressive too. As you know the total capacity of the battery is not the actual capacity because of loses through conversion from internal cells through 5V usb interface. External batteries usually loose 30% of its rating by the time it gets to the tablet/smartphone internal battery. In case of Astro Slim3, I ran multiple charger/discharge cycles and on average found that you can actually get up to 4800 mAh of the charging capacity. That is 80% efficiency which is very impressive. I see more reviews from other Slim3 users confirming these results as well.<br /><br />Often you have to set your device on a surface to plug in battery for recharge. Carrying both together is not very convenient. With Slim 3 you can actually do that with ease. I'm using book-cover case with my Nexus 7 where I can wedge the battery and continue using my tablet while it's charging up.  That setup is very convenient, especially if you are playing power draining games or watching a movie, or in general when you don't have time to wait for battery of your tablet/smartphone to charge up. In my opinion, this battery is a must have considering its portability and high capacity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome<br />  Totally addicting.  Can't put it down.  It's fun having races against friends and family to see who can last longer.
B008602KQI|4.0|The idea of the movie was interesting. It was action enough to capture your interest and don't make you bored. Worth watching once!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|A must see for any Sci-Fi fan. To bad there are only two seasons. I would love to see more.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This movie is the best example of strategy moves and game of strategy, I've ever seen. Very interesting, I enjoyed it a lot!
B0012DP8A6|3.0|A very entertaining movie, but the stand out is the presentation of &#34;Skid Row.&#34;  After that the movie could not measure up to the high standard set after that performance.  If it was just &#34;Skid Row&#34;  That gives the movie five stars; but that  was not the case.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love it.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were watertight and made of metal.  What else is there to say?  This is awesome!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|[[ASIN:B00670VHW2 Beyblades JAPANESE Metal Fusion #BB122 Diablo Nemesis Starter Set]]<br /><br />hi i like beybade k this de god bleybade i bet all other bleybay i threw this bley down the stairs and set f thing on fire
B0000047EC|5.0|Sweet sounds.  Perfect mix.  I wore one out and had to replace it.  Can't live without it.  Very relaxing evening music.  also love it on a long drive.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Besides being a book, this book is also a collection of paper pages. On these pages there's ink. That's where the words come from.
B00DU73T08|5.0|Wasn't sure I would like this movie from what others had said.  Heard really good things and the opposite end of that spectrum. It was awesome.  Kind of like an internal hunger games movie but better story line in my opinion.
0316232955|5.0|I was pretty amazed with this book, after seeing the movie I didn't expect the book to be much different, but I found that in some aspects it was, you really discover more about Carson's personality and what he feels when certain things happen, which I think is not that clear in the movie. So I think that even if you've seen the movie buying this book is worth it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Great CD. I've always had top notch service with Amazon. I recommend using this site to everyone I know, on a regular basis.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This is a great game one of the best I have played  but I wish you could change the map or buy new maps
B009FZHYKU|5.0|From the first season to this most recent season, I have not been disappointed. The playback was good, and was able to watch the episodes back to back no problem.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is very entertaining to play, it's a real time passer! It's perfect for kids and adults of all ages! But..... it stopped working for me after the update. It's never finishes loading. I'm really disappointed..... because I love this game so much I'm going to delete it from device and redownload again from cloud! After that I'm going to see how it works. I hope it works, wish me luck guys!<br />I hope this review was helpful to you, and people who made this, please  fix this!<br />:-)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|From the first season to this most recent season, I have not been disappointed. The playback was good, and was able to watch the episodes back to back no problem.

B007Q4Y9I2|5.0|The first album that would help move the Prog rock genre through the seventies and beyond. Great music even if some of it was lifted from classical composers. It was interesting how they interwoven classical music with rock and roll as a three piece. Still a great album with different mixing enhancements and alternate versions. The only complaint is that &#34;Tank&#34; is not in the 5.1 remix DVD version- Why?  I remember Lucky Man always played on the radio but it never got that high on the singles chart. Still if you never heard of this band and you like orchestral rock mixed with other elements- Check it out.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Not only do I love this album, I love the messages this album gives. I have liked all of ABR's albums, but this one...is just unbeatable
B007Q4Y9HS|5.0|Tarkus was the first ELP album that I listened to from start to finish back in the early 80's. I was in high school then and of course the album was out 12 years prior but WOW!!! it was an influence. Now it is still an influence but with new enhancements. the 3-disc set is well worth the price with extra bonus tracks that are true bonuses. The title track is quite a musical journey that is non-stop mythical lyrics with underlying meanings.  The other two stronger tracks on the CD/DVD are &#34;A Time and a Place&#34; and &#34;Bitches Crystal&#34;. To me the bonus tracks, &#34;Oh My Father&#34; and &#34;Unknown Ballad&#34; (Just a Dream) are really excellent but very different from the album proper. Steve Wilson has a slightly different mix which is still true the original album. Overall TARKUS has improved.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesom i wold recomind it to anyone who loves to create things and build them,my number 1 game
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The story was well-thought and expertly executed by the animation and voice actors.  Loved Steve Carell in this.  Awesome family entertainment!
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|This is the bargain set of the year.  It is almost too much to comprehend.<br />17 discs......tons of bonus material including unreleased tracks, mono mixes, radio spots, studio chatter, etc.... I love that kind of stuff.<br />The quality of the box is great too. The album replicated sleeves are really fun to look at, with a lot of info and images...although you'll need some ocular assistance as the type is small.<br />I keep taking all of the CD sleeves out of the box, and just thumbing through them, because they are really fun to look at.  I kinda feel that same sense of awe that I had as a kid in the 70s pouring over every word and picture of each album.....<br />The remastering is excellent, and all together, you get a perfect picture of an incredible songwriter and singer.<br />All packed into this little/big box!<br />Get this while you can. It looks to be a bit of a sleeper now, but like so many other sets, I bet is gone within a year, and resold for 5 times the original cost....
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Outstanding movie.  I had watched in may times when I was younger and was glad to find it on DVD
B002LVVCQM|5.0|If you need an introduction to evolution as well as the over abundance of evidence. Great of open-minded people looking to be amazed by non-random processes.
B003MW6OCQ|5.0|For whatever reason, people enjoy ('enjoy' seems odd here) bad news about the economy, killer meteorites, tsunamis, etc.  Ridley presents very thought provoking rebuttals to such popular 'doomsday' themes as overpopulation, global food shortages, and climate change.  He also presents a fascinating discussion of how society's ability to create technology seems to take a big leap when those societies reach a critical mass in terms of their population.
B001G7SS96|5.0|It came as expected, and I would recommend them. Don't know about customer service, since I didn't have to use them.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I played this game on the PC from Big Fish and I enjoyed it then.  I was surprised when I found it here on Amazon in the app store but very pleased.  The game is identical to the version you play on your PC and worth the $1.99 price.  If you a puzzle solver and enjoy a little logic, I think you might enjoy this game.  Now keep in mind that I picked this game up as the FAOTD.  I could tell you I would have paid $1.99 for the application, but in all honesty I'm not so sure I would have given this a 5 star rating had I paid 2 bucks.  If you're getting this free, it's a no brainer.  If you paying full price you might find this game rates around the 4 star mark.<br /><br />The playing time of the game seems to be over 2 hrs which I like to consider a benchmark for any game that costs money to be a mark they must achieve.  Worked very well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Easy to understand, and the game does a good job explaining the tasks required to complete the goal at hand.
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The ending caught me a bit by surprise , and made me likethe book even more.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My daughter told me about this application.  Her class would use it in school during some kind of math lesson.  Now there is no real math involved in terms of adding and subtracting, but there is a great deal of spacial conception and logic.  It will improve your child's ability to think things out and get past obstacles that might at first seem impossible.  I even found myself playing it for a few hours before putting it down for a break.<br /><br />Although I grabbed this application when it was the Free App of the Day, I would easily have paid 99 cents had I known just how much value this app can hold in terms of teaching children, and also entertaining.  This game is also enjoyable to adults for the logic puzzle solving lovers.  I do not buy many applications, I think I could count all of the apps I paid for with real money on one hand.  But this is one application that I think everyone considering this game app, that this is easily worth the money.  I would have been pleased with this application if cost double the listed price, I was that impressed.<br /><br />The game is not complicated, but it is progressive challenging.  The game will teach you how to play in the first few levels and from that point on, you'll quickly grasp the concept of how to complete the levels.  Basically your goal is to make an identical ball as pictured on the box (of the level you are on).  Sounds easy, sure.... but wait until you get through a dozen or so levels, then you'll find yourself using your brain a little bit more than you first expected.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys logic, math and spacial puzzles.  Worked very well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun to play, makes you really think! You get to a point that you think you can't figure it out and almost give up, then you get it!
B004132I20|5.0|I love this show! It's become one of my favorite shows of all time, i love how every episode feels like a movie. I'm also such a fan of Benedict and Martin and their amazing chemistry on screen.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Great to have this classic in the collection. No ratings, but some language makes it PG or PG 13 maybe.
B00B5AP7NY|1.0|THIS IS A RECORDED OVER DVD OF ANOTHER MOVIE CALLED MASTERSON.  YES, I HAVE A BLURAY THAT TELLS THE NAME OF THE MOVIE INSIDE THE PLAYER.  THIS UNAUTHORIZED RECORDING OF LEGO BATMAN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY!  I HAD THE JOY OF LISTENING TO MY SON CRY WHEN HE COULD NOT HEAR HIS NEW LEGO BATMAN MOVIE.  I AM PRETTY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS ILLEGAL AND AMAZON WILL NOT BE HAPPY.  i AM DEFINITELY NOT HAPPY AND I AM NOT WASTING MY TIME TO RETURN THIS JUNK.  I EXPECT A REAL LEGO BATMAN AT MY DOOR LIKE YESTERDAY! THIS WAS REALLY QUITE IGNORANT OF YOU BECAUSE ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS LET ME KNOW IT WAS GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME.  I WOULD HAVE WAITED TO HAVE THE REAL THING.  TO HAVE WHAT WAS DESCRIBED AND WHAT I PAID TO HAVE FOR MY SON.<br />CAROL
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great to get the feel of taking care of your own horse. You can brush, feed, and ride your horse. You can even name your horse and buy different horses.
0446547573|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It had my attention starting on the first page and kept my attention until the last page.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a good game mixing puzzle solving, searching, utilizing tools found, and memory. The music needs a little more variation.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I thought this movie was no good until I realized the next movie will explain it is a different dimesion then the comic book if you are looking for the origins to be the comic book his movie is not for you. In the comic book banshee joins in the gaint size  number 1 Havok is not an original member. I believe of the top of my mind only Magento is the first enemy of the x men. It is suppose to be Cyclops, Marvel Girl Ice Man Angle an the Beast (the only Orginal xman and) Xaiver. I would watch it thinking about the new movie Days of the Future Past
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not one to play games never Bern into video games or Facebook games, but I'm addicted to minion rush!!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Still two great characters and great sex scenes and I think the dramatic tension from the plot within a plot  worked well.  The former rock star flame also worked just right.  I actually liked this book better because the sex scenes were fewer (and therefore better) and the nuances more interesting than in the first novel.<br /><br />The book should left off with a satisfying enough point of closure with Eva and Gideon's --warts, wonderful, hot, raw and all.  It was time to leave us to our own imagination of what the future will hold for these two larger than life endearing characters.  The novel and interesting exploration of how hot adult sex can survive past sexual victimization was interestingly but more than adequately explored in these first two novels.<br /><br />I am not surprised to have read the reviews that many found the third book to be disappointing.  Unfortunately, Ms. Day has succumbed to the pursuit of too much of a good thing.
B001NYU23C|5.0|Great music all the way through the album.  &#34;Yesterday to Tomorrow&#34; and &#34;#1 Zero&#34; stand out as great songs that didn't get radio play as singles.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well wort reading, easy to take in and gives you inspiration. Very well put together, nice to get the feedback link at the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics and it keeps the kids busy on trips! They love El Macho's lair and the cute purple minions.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Pretty good movie, good acting, but i think that most of these reviews are praising it too much. Good job.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|my daughter loves this game every time she comes home she runs to come and play this game. now we ask her what do u want to be when you grow up she says. a doctor this game really shows what some doctors do so keep up the good this a great game for little doctors.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|of course i have this on my computer but it is handy on my kindle for searching thanks for having avaiable
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The constant surprises in plot make it impossible to put the book down. And it makes you wonder what you would do if you were placed in the same situation.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|deleted it i use it for a while but it was to young for me more for kids i am sure they will like it
140006922X|5.0|This book is about as truthful a possible account of the life and times of Jesus can be, and it is is written in a very \\"accessible\\" manner. Those who condemn the book because Aslan is a Moslem completely miss the point. The life of Jesus will never be known unless you look closely at the way he and his peers lived in a time of Roman occupation, when there were few if any laws involving human rights as we know them today. Those who condemn the book because Aslan doesn't adhere to the interpretation of the \\"testimony\\" of the New Testament which devout believers do so blindly, are also wandering in the woods, because we can never truly know what The Truth was (is) unless we were there, saw what took place, wrote it down (or video taped it,) and then analyzed the event after our firsthand witnessing. Of course, that cannot be done, so EVERYTHING written about Jesus, and all of history, is basically speculation, hearsay or an approximation. Those who believe blindly are certainly entitled to do so. Had they been born in a Moslem country, they would probably be believers of the Koran blindly as well. This book is not written for the fundamentalists who trust every word written in The New Testament as absolute - never to be \\"interpreted\\" or ever questioned. It is written for those of us who think critically, analyze what we learn, have open minds and might bring this scholarship (and Aslan is a recognized scholar who NEVER claimed to have a Ph.d. in History anywhere, but in Sociology of Religion - which deals with history...) into our thinking. I actually think he does little to prove or disprove Jesus' existence at all and no one has ever proven to me that Jesus (or any other biblical character) is not simply characters from stories in a book. But that's not what this book is about either. It's about looking at the Jesus that was written about almost 2,000 years ago, and bringing some educated scholarship, based on what we know about the times he would have lived in; saying that Jesus was actually a revolutionary, and not this meditative, apolitical character who events took over and crucified according to some mystical plan. Aslan is actually saying that Jesus, if he did exist at all, played a powerful role in his own fate, and that we should understand that the man Jesus actually fought for his beliefs, much like many others who also ended up with the same fate - trial, tribulation, crucifixion (this actually happened to thousands, not hundreds, of Jews, etc. under Roman occupation.) The difference between them and Jesus, as Aslan writes, was that Jesus, many years after his supposed death, had followers who kept the story (rumor?) going into modern history.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|just downloaded it having used it to much it but i have it on my computer so i know it will work out great
B009WUBERW|4.0|If lots of action is your bag, this is it. You may think that the opening scenes chewed up all of the special effects/stunt work budget. WRONG!<br />And you get to see most (maybe all) of the older action actors of years past. Good fun.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this one is a big challange i am glad i picked this one i play it alot hard to win but that is what makes it a good game

B004UID2LC|5.0|so great so many funny videos on it i like the gangman dance with the mom and son and all the crazy cat pics
159463176X|4.0|This book has a good story line, but it is hard to read.  I had trouble keeping up with who was narrating and who the author was referring to many times.  I felt like I needed a pad to jot down characters and their place in the story, and had to go back and re-read some of the text read early on.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Quality of the production is excellent, the singing and music is very good quality and the acting (unlike with many operas) is very good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addicting! I play for hours trying to beat my friends. This game is great for all ages, kinda like temple run but better!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the Bible, so this is a great app! I mean, It doesn't crash or anything like that, so, it works perfectly fine especially the fact that it lets you log in to your YouVersion account so that's a bonus! But one thing is I can't figure out how to download offline versions. Everything besides that thing is really cool.

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Thi game is awesome I love it got weaphones firearms simulator and one day this ad popped up and I was going to buy it but decided to wait because I only had 107 coins left so I went to youtube to see how it was so it looked pretty good so I bought it and haven't stopped playing it since.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I cannot wait to see the movie!<br /><br />I finally understand where many of the old images of starvation and death in Nigeria come from.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game it is soooooo addicting!!!! Everyone should have this game!! It is hilarious!! Get this game...i totally recommend it!!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|I just finished watching Season 1 and Season 2 and I can't wait to see what Season 3 has in store.  I love all the caracters, especially Harvey, Mike, Donna and Rachel.<br />I hooked on this show!

140006922X|1.0|He has been leaving profanity laced comments on his twitter account.  I think for the dates of 8-1-2013 and 8-2-2013 he has been doing this.  He's an authority on Christ?  A vulgar muslim?
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have been looking for a good mahjong game and really like this one.  Looking for a relaxing game, this is the one you need.
0739343718|5.0|Beautifully crafted - a real pleasure as the story unfolds. And this production is read by the author - as good as it can be done!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This series is fantastic!  I have never read about the \\"cousins war\\" before from so many view points, especially the \\"Warwick\\" side of things.  Keep it up 's Gregory, getting the White Princess right now (have read the Red and White Queens).  Love English history.
1597771007|5.0|Quintessentially English and of its time (mainly pre and very beginning of WWII). The story is sad but redemptive, and there is a nice kick in the tail. But the real delight is in the language - so beautifully crafted. A gem.
B005FDXT32|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. I always watch the Deal of Day to see if I can capture my favorites at a great price and then I give my dvd version to some poor soul who hasn't even seen a classic.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Delightful story that takes you back to your childhood and makes you wonder how far an imagine can go.  The author sure has a vivid one.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I Love it!!! It's not slow and has funny extras. Best uno game I've played.really good on the kindle. :)
193700788X|3.0|Review contains spoilers.<br /><br />I didn't love this - the departure from being exclusively in Sookie's POV felt off to me, and it had a hurried, lets-wrap-everything-up feel.  I could not remember one of the two villains, and the \\"tall man\\" \\"medium man\\" business was confusing and went on too long, especially since, in the audiobook, the medium man's voice was similar to the voice the narrator uses for Eric.  It felt like the author was parading in all of Sookie's former suitors one by one so they could be considered and discarded, and it inevitably left Sam.  The reasons given for why things would not have worked out with Eric were good ones, but I still missed him, and never felt any heat in the relationship between Sookie and Sam.  This is the HEA you would wish for Sookie if she were your friend, but it was kind a dull, perfunctory read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played other bingo games and not one has even come close to this one. I like all of the options that are available. I feel that this game is the best bingo game out there.
B003L77G6K|5.0|This show is pee-your-pants-hysterical ... Seriously love this tv show. I can't get enough of it! We watch it almost every night. If you've never seen the Big Bang theory - well I feel sorry for you cause you're missing out.
1936891026|5.0|this book is perfect for any creative or non creative person trying to venture out in the world and put themselves out there. it has humor and heart. it has really helped me a lot recognizing what can sometimes block the creative process and how to help it along. i have recommended this book to dozens of my friends, and so far it hasn't steered anyone wrong. check this book out. it is for everyone
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Kinda hooked after intro, under a buck, I bit. Good graphics, fairly realistic, good physics, gotta try and make all the missions without getting shot down, crashing, etc. Won't spoil the last mission but I confused it by making it . Waiting for the next set of missions . Gimme rudder and options instead of pre programmed endings and it'll be 5 stars
B001UFQNF0|2.0|This was a gift that I was given and I never intended it for play.  Just another movie prop for the collection.  It is way too fragile for kids to use.  This is something that just needs to be left on the shelf.  It looks cool and people want to mess around with it and open the doors, move the tires, etc.  I was disappointed that the battery died about a week after owning it.  That means it doesn't light up, no sounds, nothing.  I guess I can take it apart, but I should have to do that after about a week or so.
B000002B35|5.0|This was a replacement for my worn out CD's that I played so much that they would not work any more!!
B0087EACJK|5.0|Cool concept that was well done.  Graphics look very polished as well.  I definitely enjoyed this game.  Don't know how long it was to beat, though.
0143113100|5.0|I bought this as a recommendation to understand how electronics effect and change brain chemistry (neuroplasticity).  Each chapter in this book covers a different aspect of neuroplasticity from amputees to stroke victims to addiction and explains how the brain can recuperate with the right treatment.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This app features a number of  easy to follow workout routines that include specialized workouts as well as full-body workouts.  Even the 5 minute workout is challenging for me, and I thought I was in shape!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. As I have 2 homes in 2 different states, I rely heavily on the forecast and temps. When traveling it is my first &quot;go to&quot; site. I would certainly recommend this app to anyone (and I have!).
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|I am sure I've played this game before, so I was excited to download it today. It took a LONG time to download. Now the game will not open on my Kindle Fire. :-(
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|And then you realize that you have played for half an hour as you try to get just a little bit further on each track and with each vehicle.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This book is a sensitive memoir that should be required reading for all Americans. I found it fascinating, having lived in the South<br />part of my childhood, and having had a mother born and bred in Alabama. The book was hard to put down, and each character<br />was portrayed with a clarity that could only come from the author's real life experiences. What I took from the book was its very<br />clear message that all people are human beings with the same inner reservoire of feelings and that we all need to realize that<br />underneath surface differences, the most important race of all is the human race. The movie made from the book was as<br />engaging as the original. An unforgettable story!
1609611543|5.0|After discussing a binge eating problem with my therapist and being clued in to a \\"carb addiction,\\" I started searching the internet high and low for why this might be and what I could do about it.<br /><br />Enter Wheat Belly.<br /><br />For months, I read the blog and scoured discussion boards on the topic, and then finally read the book. I am so relieved to know that the problem isn't me - it's what I've been eating.<br /><br />I highly recommend that - if you suffer from binge eating, skin conditions like acne and rosacea, and anxiety or depression - that you check out this book! You can follow me at [...] to see how my progress is going following this plan.<br /><br />First, however, read the cookbook:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1609619366 Wheat Belly Cookbook: 150 Recipes to Help You Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]<br /><br />- it gets you started on \\"what\\" to do - then you can read this book and learn \\"why\\" we do it!
B003WH765U|5.0|The movie and the book from which it was taken tell a riveting tale of race relations but this time involving whites and Asians.<br />It's a love story with many twists and turns, some of them agonizing. Red Buttons, known chiefly as a comedian, played his<br />tragic role with amazing depth, proving that his talent went far beyond depicting the comic aspects of life. Like the late<br />Danny Kaye, this &#34;funnyman&#34; was a gifted dramatic actor. The photography was outstanding, as was the performance of all<br />of the actors. I'm so glad to have the DVD so I can share it with my grandchildren as part of their understanding of history<br />and the powerful emotions we have about our cultural and racial differences. Every time I see this film, I find something new<br />in it. It's one of the great films of all time, so I'm especially pleased to now own the DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun!!!  I love that the other minions hold up pictures of your friends!  I have recommended this to all my Facebook friends!
B001V5CIFI|5.0|My husband & I are senior citizens but we watched this movie everytime it was on TV. I ordered this movie for my step daughter's birthday. I know she will like it too.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is a great mixer board for those starting off in podcasting.  Provides enough features for the price to make it a new brainer.  Makes bringing in guests via Skype a breeze.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Yep, they never seem to end but then again they remain unique enough to not have gotten tiresome yet. The movie is full of action as one would expect and is well acted by everyone involved. The special effects while nothing spectacular were good enough to go with an action/adventure film.<br />Yes, the Die Hard series lives on and apparently will contine to judging by the quality of this latest edition. Worth a purchase or buy the collectors edition if this one is included and get all the Die Hard Movies at once.<br />I highly recommend this film to anyone that likes action/adventure movies much less those featuring Officer McClain.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game! It's great that you can connect your FB account so your coins and credits are available.  If you like to play bingo this is the best game out there.
B000IZXR20|4.0|The acting by both main characters, a brother and sister was superb. The only question is why Justin went on to have an ongoing successful career in moviemaking when the incredibly gorgeous young lady that played his sister hasn't been seen by me anyway since I saw this movie. She is certainly a good actress and is one of those heart stoppingly gorgeous women that a person sees about once a month if they both get out a lot and are lucky. Man, \\"hot\\" doesn't quite cover the lass as a description. She would literally take the air out of a room full of men when she entered.......oh well.<br />Great movie full of just about everything wants in a typical horror movie. Evil, eteranal shape-shifting monster with his own dungeoun covered in his years worth of victims bodies. A spooky psychic black lady that sees all and knows all but who of course is ignored by everyone and........well, to go any further would ruin the movie.<br />If anyone knows where I can find a poster of the actress that plays the sister role in this movie, let me know. If anyone knows of her appearing in anything else besides this movie, let me know that as well!<br />I highly recommend at LEAST renting this movie. Purchasing a used copy from one of Amazons many vendors might be a good idea as it is worthy of an additional viewing from time to time and the small businesses that depend on Amazon for a large portion of their income could use the very few dollars this movie would cost.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys the horror genre. The only disappointment was that the gorgeous old Chevrolet the brother and sister were driving was a four door rather than a two door. I would consider giving up a testicle for a two door version of the (initially), very clean old classic 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet the two are featured driving across country.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Sony has created the perfect collection for Harry Nilsson--in fact, one would hope other companies would study this fine package and copy it for other artists. Sony has included all of Nilsson's RCA albums--each album includes extensive outtakes and rarities--and three CDs of outtakes from the vaults. They are packaged in a large box which conveniently swings open to reveal the small cardboard sleeves with the CDs. Each cardboard sleeve is lovingly designed to protect your CD--these are not the cheap cardboard sleeves so common today that you fear will scratch your CD but capacious sleeves with plenty of room. Each album is on a separate CD with the original cover art--what a delight to see those old covers after all these years. The entire package will fit wonderfully in your CD collection, replacing about 8 CDs in those old plastic boxes.<br /><br />And this is Harry Nilsson whose work has been neglected so long in this country. He had a wonderful sweet voice with a beautiful tone--and his gift for song was amazing. His handful of hits have more or less been forgotten--but his amazing combination of pop, psychedelia, and classic American song is fresh and sweet today. I am just very very happy to have this package--a feeling I suspect Nilsson fanatics everywhere will share.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|All three (and the fourth featuring a new Bourne like character), Bourne movies are superb. The first and third were the best with the second somewhat flawed but still highly enjoyable.<br />I would recommend buying these movies as a collection edition so you get all of them and save some money while doing so. The action is superb and the acting and casting was dead on.<br />Despite Mr. Damons liberal views, especially those regarding the Constitutionaly guaranteed right of everyone to keep and bear arms (Mr. Damon believes firearms should be outlawed), he seems to have no qualms whatsoever in making tens of millions of dollars making movies featuring the use of firearms in abundance. But that is the nature of the over the top liberal types. I would bet that when in public Mr. Damon has a bevy of heavily armed bodyguards yet he would deny you that same kind of protection on a basis that you can afford.<br />But back to the movie. This like the entire series is superb and I highly recommend it to any and everyone and to purchase not just to rent as you will want to re-watch these films from time to time.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I've John Fogerty since I was a kid. Still do.And that includes my granddaughter /age 7 and the rest of the family.
B003KRJNBW|3.0|The surprise ending about the much coveted book was great. The movie itself was of mixed quality. Plenty of action and overall a good Apocolyptic movie but to imagine Alcatraz as Americas final repositiory of everything regarding the wrtitten word and the history of mankind is somewhat of a stretch, especially in a land without power. How do you control the humidity for all the manuscripts in a rotting old prison that was closed 40 years ago because the environment was rotting it away?<br />The actions sequences save the movie and though it is nowhere near Denzel Washingtons best movie neither is it his worse. I would have to give one of his train disaster movies the credit for being the worst movies he ever made and you can choose either one of the two train disaster movies he seemed to have made back to back.<br />Worth a rental, not worth a purchase in my humble opinion.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|great movie but miss his first girlfriend.  other than that it was awesome plenty of action and just a plain great movie

B00DQC2FPM|5.0|People are complaining the date set for the past is wrong. The brick says 1958. In the movie they travel to 1955. This is not a mistake, but a inside joke for Lego. 1958 was the year the first Lego brick was produced.

B000F3UAFC|4.0|This is a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I rented it. I decided I wanted to own it and have it in my personal movie collection. I have loaned it out several times for others to enjoy. It is an encouraging story of a woman trying to get along in her life, handling the many ups and downs she encounters. I would heartedly recommend it.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Anyone who liked the series Firefly will love this movie. As a fan I want to see more of everything (that is not going to happen), but I think they answered a few things in this movie. Anyone who likes this movie is going to love the TV series so go buy that to (It's even better).
0553378384|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I am not a huge follower of astrology but after reading this it has pushed me into investigating more about it. A fascinating read! About a year ago I did a past life hypnosis on myself and this book just confirmed what came up in the hypnosis. It really explains some of my personality traits and it made complete sense, I had a lot of ahhaa moments. Reading it was like having someone follow me my whole life and noticing my in and outs, it was almost eerie and certainly amazing. If you want to learn how to have more conscious awareness of yourself to help you get through issues and grow, this is the book! I loved it, you won't regret the purchase.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This show did not deserved to get cancelled and should have gone on for at least another 10 season, but the people who run Fox are beyond stupid and don't know a great series when they see one. Firefly is my favorite TV series of all time (and I watch a lot of TV). Wish it never ended and yes it is that good.
