B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have been a big fan of this series.  Loved almost every one of them.  This was a giant disappointment.  No dynamics, none of the normal \\"Reacher action\\".  It was just plain boring.  I could not wait for the end to end.  I could never figure out the blue dots, but he spent a lot of time talking about them.  In the end, I gave up even worrying about it, since it did not matter at all in the endless, endless, endless, endless, endless descriptions of a maze of rooms.  This was by far the worst Jack Reacher novel.  The only up-side was finding out how to talk for a minute without saying a word with the letter \\"A\\" in it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is Epic!!! I would recommend this game to just about anybody. It has improved graphics, better game play, good sounds, cool traps, nice upgrades and<br /><br />  ITS FOR FREE!!!
B0031RS894|4.0|I'm a huge Doctor Who fan. I started watching the show in the mid 80s and only recently rediscovered the new series. I enjoyed this Whovian novella quite a bit, even though it's definitely geared toward a younger audience. If you are looking for a quick Who-fix, this short work will not disappoint you as long as you don't mind the quickness of the read. Like I said, it's written for a YA crowd, which I don't mind. Just be aware that it's not a literary masterpiece. Doctor Who fans will enjoy it regardless.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This has got to be one of the best horror series on reg TV.<br /><br />A friend told me about it had to watch.  I watched the first season via Netflix the second wasn't available there yet to I rented from Amazon- the video quality was excellent and no freeze  ups if I paused etc. Netflix often has that problem.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great read. Kept my attention throughout. End I g was quite bizarre though. Would encourage friends to read this book
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's fun,but if you play it to much you could get bored,but I like it,and it is fun.So I think you should buy it...)
B0081SPK0I|2.0|Bought it for my grandson but its not even good for him.<br />Maybe for the real games but not sure.  Try it first.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game I play it pretty much every day even tho some of the levels are a little frustrating :-)
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 4 year old grandson wanted this app.  Now I'm addicted too, although he is much better than I am. The reasoning required to feed this little guy makes our brains work.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love angry birds a lot but I got the mighty eagle update and was disappointed when it said you have to pay for it. the power ups are kinda lousy to but overall great game
B004SIP9E2|5.0|i got this movie because when it is on  tv they edit alot of stuff so thats why i bot this movie
B00A757EFW|2.0|I thought this would be a good game since I'm a fan of pac man but I found out the controls are really hard to work with. I wouldn't exactly recommend this app.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I love the show and gave this to my son for Christmas. This is the best comedy on TV right now/
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom I am grateful to have you in my lifetime and your readings are my thoughts that could have not written myself. As for the stories, perfect.
B004TLM4Z0|5.0|I remember listening to this in high school. I still think this is one of their best albums.ah high school memories lol.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great graphics and route variety make it even better!  The views are so different it added to difficulty as I kept getting distracted by the scenery.  *Kindle fire user
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The sounds actually sound realistic unlike most white noise machines I've found in stores which cost a lot more. Not bad for a free app
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this is s fun brain tricking game that Is easy and hard I find it amusing and u can't stop when u statrek.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Such good music and lyrics.  It's always refreshing to find a song that's not just a love song.  Though I've listened to &#34;Viva La Vida&#34; many times, I'm still not exactly sure what it all means, and that gives it lasting interest.  Plus, it's inspired some great spoofs/tributes on You Tube.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait for this book to be filmed. Honestly it's probably going to be the best yet. Christian Grey is one romantic man.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I absolutely love the musical!!  I have watched it over and over and over.....the voices are phenomenal and unforgettable !!!!  The only thing that I don't like is that the music is not available on a cd!!!!  I would love to play it in my car on my way to work every day, a big disappointment that I am not able to do that.....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun and helpful if you like horses and want to train. I play every day! Every thing you do in this game you can make real!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|loved the twists and elusive turns. I really liked jo's charter and i could relate to katie's struggles and lonesomeness.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I Love it!!!! Easy to work..easy to up load pictures and crop or do special effects and frames...I like it so much that I have this on my kindle fire HD and also my cell phone
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Way cool game! Graphics are great and I am still playing it after 5 days!!!!! For free too.  You can't go wrong!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I give this a five star rate because you can get different types of characters and for the seasons it changes. You should buy this app. And by the by the way my name is Sophie I'm 14.<br /><br />  BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Havent used it yet but I heard it works very well. I do like the design and the the ability to sharpen serrated edges is nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing book that i loved from start to finish. I had an incredibly hard time putting my kindle down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey...and season 3 so far hasn't been a disappointment! :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is much easier and more fun!!<br />This game is way better then the first!!!!!!<br />Totally worth the download great kids and if u have nothing to do or if u do have something to do!! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did the mistake of watching the movie before the book and realize now just how much more In depth it goes. This book is always exciting and feels real... Would very much, recommend this book.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|What a cute game. I love all of the adorable grapics and sounds. I always lose track of time when I play this game.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who loves the series but just didn't own the books. I bought them for her and then she told me to read them. Overall one of the best series' I've read! The art on the covers and sleeves are amazing. It's definitely a must-buy for any Hunger Games fan!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best yet if they don't make any more but in a sort of cool way but I still like it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is soo addicting I play this game every day<br />so if u can get this game on your device get and you'll see how addicting it is
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so fun I hope u guys like It too. its a really fun game talk to y'all later
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I let my kids play this game this game and they love it. Almost as much as they love being in our stable. And I'm not going to lie, I enjoy the game as well
B008GJV19Q|5.0|This is a great movie but it was interrupted for &#34;buffering&#34; so many times that it was maddening!  Don't know what is going on as this was my first rental....will try again but if &#34;buffering&#34; persists I may try a competitor.  The movie is one of our top ten!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One if the greatest books I've read in a long time. I defiantly recommend the book to everyone. Read it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great characters, fresh ideas. Never b<br />Slowed down. Can't wait to find out what happens next! This would make a great movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love these books.  Once I start it is hard to put it down. Can't wait for the next one.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|This album is very well done and the main song is wonderfully romantic. If you loved the film like me then you need this album.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is an ok game if you ask me. I don't care if you get it its free.You get what you want don't listen to any reviews but mine.
B003ODL004|5.0|I loved the movie and I love Hans Zimmer's work. This album is great to listen to on long drives.
0061537969|5.0|I have to admit I love dogs and therefore am biased to like a story told from the canine perspective. The Art of Racing in the Rain is told from Enzo the dog's perspective. Enzo, owned by the key character Denny, an aspiring race car driver, is nearly human in his mental capacity and of course exceeds us in sensory abilities. His narration is moving, humorous and a bit scattered as one might expect from an energetic and playful dog's mind. Enzo at times is just a bit too smart to believe, which detracts from the otherwise real-life feel of the plot.<br /><br />What I liked most is the racing metaphor that crops up frequently in Enzo's narration. Apparently you can find a life lesson for just about any situation on the race track. Denny, who becomes a single parent during the story, is framed and manipulated by relatives who want custody of his daughter. The story draws you in completely, triggering feelings of anger, resentment and compassion in a surprisingly powerful way. It is so moving that one sometimes wants to put the book down to avoid discovery of what comes next. Just like life. It is really a great story.<br /><br />Enzo the dog becomes your friend. He has his own parallel story that also draws you in and moves you. I read the book aloud to my wife in the evenings and, I can't believe I'm writing this, near the end his narrative choked me up to the point that I could barely keep speaking. First time. Amazing.<br /><br />I rate this book five stars based on an engaging plot, well-developed characters, believable situations and excellent use of the racing metaphor to tie the book together from cover to cover. The issue of a too-smart dog is minor and at most rates a 1/2 star reduction in the rating, not possible on Amazon's rating scale.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My son set this up for me on my Kindle Fire....it worked perfectly!  I have only used it once but plan to use it for future travel.  It is handy!
B003NWS5AO|4.0|R.P. is getting old, and his voice is not what it once was, but he picked music that he can still do. This CD is pretty mellow by ZEP standards, but Plant can still sing. He may not be able to hit the high notes, but the songs he picked for this album fit his vocal range well. I am a huge R.P./ZEP fan, and I was not disappointed by this CD. More folk than rock, but it's good. The other musicians are very good too.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game....but, need more explanation of &#34;bombs&#34;, and how to get extra colors.  Also, hard to draw precisely sometimes with only my fingertip...can another tool be used to draw?  the items to draw selection is limited and repeated too frequently.  Some choices are unknown to someone my age.....over 70.
B004DM0UII|5.0|it is great to have easy listening to enhance the routine!  great selection of music to sooth the soul. loving the breeze.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and Anita's experience. I found it reassuring on life and not sweating the small stuff.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Excellent controls and really fun to play! I would have liked and option to reverse the tilt control to turn, but otherwise a great game!
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I gave it two stars because it sounds like it would be good.  The problem is that I never got it. I pushed every button available and was told that I already have it in my library.  Maybe I will upgrade it if I ever get it.
B006O3MU96|2.0|I'm not crazy about this version of Doodle Jump. It's not as fun to play as the original one and doesn't offer much in new things to do.
1608871452|5.0|I gave this book to my wife when she was in the hospital. It made her so very happy. Thank you so much!!!. Great transaction.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Nice story.  Great graphics.  Nice eerie mood and it keeps your attention.  A really good hidden object game.  Will buy others from Alawar.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|reluctantly saw this movie in the theatre and was so moved by it i had to buy it to watch it again....and again.
0385535147|4.0|I hadn't read a John Grisham in quite awhile and had been meaning to read this so I picked it up. Glad I did that. This fast-paced legal thriller, complete with Grisham's signature commentary on the legal system, is a real page-turner. Reminded me of his earlier books like The Firm, The Client, etc. Recommended for a weekend in a beach resort read.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My son and I love this movie! We have watched it several times already. So happy to find out that it was available for download.
030758836X|5.0|'Amazing''Twisty' 'Thrilling'...few words that came out soon after I finished the book. This book now on my list of favorites. Starting with a light and witty tone that leads you to believe you are in for a humorous version of some Lifetime drama..... Then suddenly you are caught so completely off guard that you can't do anything but turn the next page as fast as you can. Don't want to give away the plot...but it is the kind of book that makes you ponder, shake your head and get that churning feeling in your stomach. Need such books to keep reading alive!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Didn't hold my interest. I guess I didn't like her format. Also none of the characters was very sympathetic. Writing was competent, but if I'd looked at it  before buying, I wouldn have bought it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is so much fun! After downloading it on my Kindle I played for two hours straight! However if you quit the game it WILL NOT open again! UGH!!! The only way to play it again is to uninstall it and then reinstall.  Of course ALL of your progress is gone and you start from scratch!  I would easily give it five stars except for this.  There is NOTHING worse than playing a game.....getting achievements.....unlocking new characters and just lose them. GRRR I rate this game SUPER FRUSTRATING! Oh and yes....I did try this three different times all with the same outcome. ;(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a good game because you can buy a lot of different things and you get to be people friends also you get to feed them and take care of it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple run 2 is cool and has better graphics but ... sometimes when you play and get little power ups some well a lot of your money/coins are gone BE CAREFUL IF YOU THINK YOU WANT THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it in so good you need to have it. like it and every one in my family likes it so get it
B00B2V66VS|4.0|just needs more characters and it will be almost perfect. you could get the old characters and make some new ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great try it is awsome I love it I enjoy it you can even have a unicorn I think it is worth 5 star's
B004GXZ69W|2.0|I initially gave a 5-star review but this is an update. When you spend this much money on a mouse, one has the expectation that it will last more than a year. Unfortunately, after 12 months of use, this mouse has gotten increasingly buggy to the point where the button programmed for a single click randomly does a double click. You can imagine the havoc this causes when working with sensitive server files and executable files! Also, when selecting code or text it has started to deselect that very selection when you release the button about 4 out of 10 times. Incredibly frustrating! Lastly, the plastic coating is flaking off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ive only had this app for a few days but I haven't found a flaw yet so I can easily say I love it. It's like having my own real horse! I recommend it.
B003A02W0I|3.0|The book is in pretty good condition except that the pages are a little yellowed and worn and there is a mark on the side of the pages.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love the game, its so fun and addicting. buuut its soundtrack is REAL creepy. it sings ring around the rosie in a child's voice sometimes , and it has a menecing background sound. plus it makes me feel wrong. but in a good way. buy it. you will enjoy it. :)
B00992CF6W|4.0|awesome game I like it because the is no end to what you can create. you can create anything and everything
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I lug this app it is amazing blab hfs hf. hf hr Eyck t t t f t t g
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it almost every day on the Pc and the xbox and now  it is in my hand forever and ever.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The grand kids loved this video.  Also brought the Gruffalo's child which the grand kids also loved.  Great short movie for children.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I would reccommend this product to anyone who has a facebook account and a Kindle Fire. I like everything about it except I wish thtey would update it some more. i am not a big fan of the mobile app on my Kindle. I was hoping it would look better like if I was on my PC but its free and work ok.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|This is not the full version that you can get either online or even for iPhone.  But it does allow me play the things I like from SoundCloud.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I fell in love with both of the main characters.  They both had issues that they had to resolve.  I am glad they worked them out.
B004GFN11A|4.0|This is a better version than the one on my iPhone.  But still not as easy to use as I'd always like.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|One of my kids favorite games. They are 5,6 and 7 and have to show me how to play! Very fun game that is challenging and great features.
B000I5SY5U|1.0|The resolution was not very good and the picture only took up a small fraction of the screen. I would have used Netflix if it was available on its site.
B004G6009U|5.0|Great movie.  The Blu-ray really makes the computer animation look realistic.  Good story.  Good guys, bad guys, highs, lows, and comedy in between.  A movie all ages of my family enjoys.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Once I start I can't stop. I love this game. I give it a big thumbs up! Such an awesome game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome espesially is you love horses like me perfect game so so so much fun hope you like it
0393338827|5.0|Michael through the many interviews he had with some of the players that saw what was happening in the years leading up to the Financial Crash of the &#34;Big Boys&#34; on Wall Street because of their mistaken beliefs that they could loan or &#34;bet&#34; that most of the really bad B class loans would not default in massive quantities through their putting together of Sub Prime Loan Bonds... and CDOs...just shows how stupid some of the men and women at the top of the leading Financial Institutions really are. The only thing that bothers me the most is that the US Government chose to bail them out and save their sorry asses. This is a great book for someone that wants to know what really caused the whole diabolical.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Everything work out well. Shipment was on time and all the things were in good working order. The quality was good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in a couple of days because I couldn't put it down. This author has a gift and I will be reading more of her work from now on! Trust me this is a five star all the way... heck I would have given it more stars if I could have!!!  Enjoy it will blow your mind!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I can't get enough of this series!  Every element ....the actors, the setting, the attention to detail, the costumes, the plot is top notch.  My only hope is that it goes on an on and on!
0061438294|5.0|This is our second time buying this book. We lent the first one out several times for friends to read and one friend stole our copy. It is such a good book we bought a 2nd copy to have in our library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are literally no words to describe how amazing this book is. Just wow. It's so sad but it's also sweet and Sky and Holder just fit together like a puzzle. Just omg.
B001FB55H6|5.0|We saw this in the theater and loved it. Excellent movie and great on blue-ray. Love the music score too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Works wonderful with kindle fire and is a wonderful app! The multiplayer works well and there are many interactive options!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Like the graphics, the new environments and the characters, however, have ran across a couple of glitches.  Nothing major though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is soooooo awesome soooooo perfect and soooooooo cool. when I first got it I was like OMG! I got to get this game because either though temple run ( the regular one) is way worser than subway surfers I just thought in the first place that temple run 2 was going to be as lame as the regular temple run. but when I got it... it was soooooo cool. I haded to play it all day and everyday. :)
B00A77II0U|5.0|this game was awesome. the story was good and the best part you could see the objects you were looking for.  anyway it was worth the money for sure. thanks guys; bring on some more...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun I like how it keeps me busy and allows me to take care of a horse which I absolutely love!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This has probably been the best game I have played on my tablet. I would highly recommend this game for someone who likes building things.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I Love the game. Hard to walk away from it! Many challenging levels to play. I downloaded on Kindle and ithey interact very well
B005DF2QMC|5.0|i wish they had included a way to buy the AC/DC adaptor cuz that was hard but the product is so rare, i was willing.<br />also it looks nice, which sounds unimportant but you will see what i mean.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book was a predictable rip off a story told time and time again. It felt choppy and did not hold my interest.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has done it again. What a marvelous book! I am still a little shaken after finishing it's a great story.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|I first saw this movie as a kid and I have loved it ever since.  Its about a robot who comes to life the girl who protects it and its inventor who becomes romanticly linked with the girl although its not a love story. It is however a very good comedy. Its also a little bit of an action movie. For the most part my idea of a good action movie is King Kong mostly because that is not only one of the best action movies of all time but also my favorite movie. However Short Circuit is good too not only because the robot comes to life but because the military is after it and its inventor and the girl who protects it try to stop it while becoming romanticly linked as I said. Well thats enough spoilers. Needless to say  you should see it.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Its a crazy movie about a crazy man. All he wants is to be famous. He is violent beyond belief, scary. He fights anyone who comes across his sight. One of many scenes I loved was when he covered himself with some grease he saved up in his cell after taking a guard hostage and making the guard do his back. He didn't hurt that guard but yelled at him scarily and told him to %&%*^)^( cover his back in the grease and to sit tight cause it was going to get hairy! He repeatedly including this scene fought 6+ guards at a time and would end up bloody in a small cage. You've got to see this!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This is a good movie. Its also a funny movie about a kid who cuts school with his best friend and his girlfriend. Iro0nicly the stuff they do wouldnt have been disapprooved of by adults. You should see it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book, touching story that people can relate too.  Book keeps flowing and is sure to leave you in tears.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is pretty cool I would like it better if it was more than just finding things<br />In different rooms
B006LSZECO|1.0|this book had lots of twists and turns, however I was not impressed with the story line. So many people have recommended this book to me, and i am not on board with all the hype.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 has to be the best temple run yet. The graphics and new format of the game are crazy. I cant wait to see how they top this one.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|saw it in the theater and it was a great movie.  kept hoping the end would come out different somehow.
0385535147|3.0|Grisham a little below par for him is still better, to me, than any other author above par for them, but I was a tad disappointed. It was suspenseful, with his usual fast pacing, but the main problem I had with it was a lack of plausibility. This may be no problem if you're into fantasy, sci-fi, etc., but I like something I can relate to or at least believe in real life. Without spoiling the ending if you haven't read it, I don't believe this ending would be possible in reality. Maybe Grisham has me a little spoiled by setting the bar so high in the past.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it has re-kindled (pun intended) my love of the Angry Birds game.  My husband thinks I'm addicted.  I like to think of it as just a little obsessed.
B00AWTTUHI|3.0|My review title sounds like an oxymoron but that's my opinion. The movie feels slow at the start then rushed. There should have been more time for the consequences of batman's final round with the joker to set in but instead we quickly forget that for the next crisis. Also, they skipped so many classic lines from the book itself. Clearly I am disappointed. But yet I am satisfied. Why? Because the casting is great. Michael Emerson as the joker was not a move I initially looked forward too but he does great. He really brings the creepy, bisexual, sadistic joker of the comic to life. Peter Weller is also great (seriously, why are people hating on him?) and superman sounds like superman. Then there are the fight scenes. I complained about timing but the fight scenes are just amazing. I felt the tension in the fight between the joker and batman. I felt the excitement as DC's two biggest boys duke it out over Gotham. This movie has its faults but I did not mind spending $14.99.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't know anything about this game, but I know my son loves it.  i can't get my Kindle away from him since i got it for him and he frequently gives me a thank you or a hug and a thank you when he gives back the Kindle. (we are working on manners.)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best book I have ever read! The story is gripping keeps you thrusted into the world and the lives of those living in it.  There is hardly ever a dull moment but just when you think it's getting boring the author throws a curve ball at you that keeps you wanting more! Cannot wait to read the other books in this Series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are great. The side graphics are like another challenge. A perfect sequel to the original Temple Run. Zip lines and mineshafts... Perfect!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|me and my 3 year daughter love it . we could play it all day. Glad its hard enough to keep me interested but easy enough for her also.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|The best season so far, I'm only half way through but it's already had more storylines than all the other seasons.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This new temple run is so boss. This is a must to get. Does have pros and cons but still a great game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I used to play this game when I was growing up with a real deck. Nice modern version with no cards to put up!
1603425381|5.0|I have used this book as a reference for crocheted borders around pot holders and it really helped my project. So beautifully presented with such yummy colours. A lovely reference book for my craft library.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Im really happy I got this app after finding Radio Nintendo and Final Fantasy radio which I listen too on a daily basis getting a dosage of the gaming nostalgia. I also occasionally will try too find 1 of Mark Levin's podcasts here and then I just love his angry voice and sarcasm! Kroq too! I do wish I could find a podcast for some anti Muslim news but that has yet too be seen.
1603420398|5.0|This book is so beautiful - the colours and photography are stunning. I love having this item as a refence tool in my library.
0780622650|5.0|I could not find this movie anywhere! It's a shame too! Because it was a good movie, someone told that it didn't sell well with the audience because they said it was too silly.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good fun game that is easy to use for all ages would recommend it to anyone for kids all the way to adult
B005LAJ16I|4.0|After all the hype on the media about this television show it did not diappoint. The writing is clever, intregueing and keeps you focused with its twists and turns. The acting is superb by all. I can hardly wait to view season two. I recommend to any mature audiance who loves spy mysteries loaded with intrigue ans action while looking into the personal lives of the maine characters.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The first half of the movie was pretty entertaining, but then the story line became the typical predictable drama that one would expect with that sort of lifestyle. Too much drama, not enough fun. The movie was intended to be more about the dancers, but it ended up being more about drugs than anything else. Way to wreck a potentially good film!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was an amazing book with thrilling adventure obtained  through past and present with many hardships.  I would recommend this book to everyone who loves the suspense and adventure. I loved every part of this gripping book and really have no bad comments regarding the book I look forward to reading the other two books of this trilogy. furthermore I give my complements to the author.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|It's interesting enough where I can continue to watch it again and again. Many movies today can't keep you coming back.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book is a throwback to the good ol' cyberpunk days.  The characters are self-aware.  They think and talk about the cyberpunk future they inhabit.
B0090EIILU|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Don't like controversial topics and crude humor? DON'T BOTHER WATCHING IT THEN!<br />It takes a person with a very open mind and a good sense of humor to appreciate films like this
B006LSZECO|4.0|Amazing book and her writing is always fantastic,but I couldn't help but feel there was something missing. Maybe I'm just the type that likes to have a complete story with a main climax moment to the book and I didn't feel that with this one. I was always waiting for the moment when something drastic would happen, whether it was something to happen to a bad person or my favorite character. Don't get me wrong, there were some shocking parts that I wasn't anticipating, but I know I am satisfied with a book when I catch myself with my mouth dropped open from a big shocker. Still a dedicated fan of Gillian Flynn and I guess because I have read her other books, which are amazing, I'm comparing her new one too harshly. Overall, she has become  one of my favorite writers I've  the past few years and would recommend all of her books to anyone looking for a juicy yet unconventional mystery.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Very good.  So much detail.  I enjoyed playing this game.  I love hidden object games and enjoy playing at the casual pace.  So much detail in so little space.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Haven't used this as I heard that this Angry Birds program had a virus..... forgot to delete it...... Am I wrong
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well done sequel to temple run. Increased the difficulty by adding hills and curves, the mine tunnels are straight out of Indiana Jones and well done.  Graphics are great!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great to have this available to check on my mail and contact with friends while traveling in area with wifi... wish it was more like cell phone to get to web etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game because you can interact with your own horse and compete with others. its a very. good game definitaly for the people who like horses. I have not ever met a horse in real life so, I get to interact with my horse.j
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great when it works...... not sure it is working right now as I don't even get message that an item has ended.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|is the one word that could sum up this season.  I liked the first season but I didn't think there enough likable characters to really connect with the show.  The second season on the other hand, had many very likable characters, some of which were also purely evil.  This season had so many different horror elements, it blew my mind how the writers tied them all together.  There are plenty of plot twists throughout the entire season, that continually change the dynamics of the characters.  There is fantastic character development, so much to the point where characters you thought were good, do horrible things and vice versa.  They also did an amazing job of making you really feel for the patients at the asylum by questioning whether events actually happened or not.  This show is definitely not for everyone and definitely not for kids, but if you are a horror movie fan or a fan of Stephen King, you will NOT be disappointed.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love twitter as I use daily to blow off steam about stupid things Obama is doing to our country and how stupid a majority of us are to have voted him back into office.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|I usually am against artists going back and remixing their classic albums. However, The Doors 2007 remix and masters of their albums have got me thinking about completing my Doors collection with the new mixes. The remaining Doors went into the studio and stayed true the original album and only enhanced all the tracks, giving a timeless classic a fresh sound. I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game it has all my favorite features and if this game weren't in existance I would be bored out of my mind
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It allows me to veiw any kind of PDF files on my kindle which if very helpful for school. I can bring my kindle instead of my cumbersome laptop and still view the same files. Very pleased with it. Worth the download!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it exits out of game when I spend diamonds but I don't get the diamonds back! please fix this problem! :'(
B0053O89WY|5.0|Best price, less than a penny per laugh, get it a penny. Big bang for the buck, there it is again. Howard they stay so funny, a lot of talent on this show.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|really fun play lots to do. I would recommend this for anyone whoever played with playmobil. A must have for all pirate lover's aswell.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I have like this product - I would really like to see this product available for Kindle Fire. That way my calendar will be the same on each device. Overall this is a great product
B001NHNG64|5.0|Good story line; excellent characters  and some fun twists.  Jack Reacher is a good character, an American James Bond that has gone rogue
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I wanted an quick & easy way to see how much battery time I have remaining.  It works, no problem.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game a lot. But after I have played it for a long time it starts to not work and it crashes on me. I thought this would never ever happen again, but it did. I thought that the people who came up with this game would make sure that this wont happen, but these people didn't put a good effort into making sure it wont crash on you.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|uninspired / trite themes / lame acting / low budget effects /  four more words required / not very good
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I felt the book was all about the plot, which is not expertly developed.  The characters are underdeveloped.  Not worth a second read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the first book I've read by this author and was impressed. Great story line and characters. Can't wait for the next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. It is hard at first but you will quickly get used to it if you played the first temple run. Not to hard if you didn't.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|Based on Don DeLillo's novel of the same name, the movie centers on a 28-year-old super billionaire named Eric who wants a haircut. He is warned that many complications lay in wait but he insists on going ahead. Along this staggeringly original odyssey, Eric hops in his seemingly indestructible Andover the top futuristic limo and begins the day long ride. Along the way he meets some extremely unique characters including his economically obliged but very distant wife Elise, his mistress, a doctor who gives him a prostate exam in the limo and his financial adviser as well as a group of insane anarchists and his own destined assassin, a psychotic man played expertly by Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />This epic journey for an every day task becomes extremely complicated and at some points is very hard to follow. The plot is completely dialogue based and the dialogue is poetically complex and takes a little bit of thought to figure out just what they're talking about, defiantly a movie that you should watch with a dictionary or thesaurus nearby.<br /><br />It really is an extremely original and very entertaining movie with several original characters. I enjoyed it but once it was done I didn't feel compelled to buy it. It lacked a certain gripping power but it was fun to watch through once and maybe I'll get it form the library again in the future.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was such a funny book yet heat warming NOT<br /> CORNYS = McDonalds yea I just did it was a great
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My son loves this movie.  The DVD itself is pretty basic, no noteworthy extras, but priced well.  Shipped quickly.  No complaints.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|1'2 of the dvds didn't play,  they would just stop and the machine would  sound like it was trying to read it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr Grisham has done it again! I couldn't put it down. So many twists, turns, deceit and fun! In true JG fashion a true page turner.
B00AFEQA5K|4.0|My wife's a huge Mathew McConaughey fan so we watch all of his movies we come across.  This one sounded interesting to say the least.  She hated this one, giving it 1 star.  I loved it, sick and twisted
B008H08XW2|5.0|Have not been disappointed with any they've done. A few known hits  and a few getting used to, thing is they are good artists. Good music and funky pictures.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I'm not a big stallone fan due to his political views.  I guess I tended to dislike the \\"original\\" Judge Dredd movie due to his starring in it and kept putting off watching this one.  For a lack of anything better to watch I gave it a try and enjoyed it.  I'm sure there are plenty of stallone fans out there that will disagree though
B0091LS07E|5.0|Tavis Smilely had her interview on few weeks ago, well when I saw it. She mentioned her new album and how excited she was to do it. That is why I bought her new album, because her excitement. Yes she is a seasoned artist proved it in this CD. Got to hear some of her songs. Only thing I didn't care for his her hair, beautiful face though, still very cute. Again great voice though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it really teaches you how to care for horses and it's free I think that's cool.I. love it 5 star from me.!!!!
B008FSCNTK|4.0|She still has a great voice, and the music is typical for her. She is a sexy lady and the pics are sweet.

076115728X|5.0|Really like the point of a mistake becoming a masterpiece.  Great artwork and interactive art for readers.  great for all ages
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good game. would have been five stars if it had been longer.even so for three bucks well worth the purchase. I didn't put it down til I finished. about two and a half hours. Not a single issue besides length. great story, graphics,and puzzles and I usually dislike object search games.
0763619612|5.0|Love the concept of encouraginging a person to do their best and the lesson that it can be passed on
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is super fun and addictive! its so hard just to put the game down for just three seconds! you can live the life of a hungry shark eating prey and avoiding predators. and i love the phrases it says. eat a puffer fish and it says puff pastry. if you die it might say lifes a beach. i absolutely love this game and i would totally get the full version!!
B000PKW73S|5.0|I watched the movie then read the book I got so much more out of the book. I will read it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great book I can't wait to read the third book<br />The first book was a little better but still a great read

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an amazing book. I finished it in 2 days. It gave me a different perspective on life and I recommend this book to everyone 16 or older. It had a lot of meaning to it and I couldn't put the book down because it was so good. Can't wait too see the movie!
B009HELT3C|5.0|You really can't go wrong with Will Smith... MIB3 was great, not as good as MIB or MIB2 but Good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing can't stop playing very addictive just like the first one except better graphics and gameplay more power ups amazing luv it and gameplay is difrent instead of just running jumping and collecting coins it has more action
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Within the lines of the Bourne movies, I have say it was not the Best... However it was a great setup movie for the next part.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was really impressed with the speed of delivery and the movies themselves are AMAZING. The case is pretty awesome, too.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|In the line of Resident Evil movies, this one was by the far the one that you would just said it was okay.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!!!  Could not put it down.<br />I read it straight through!!!  I hear there are 2 more books in this series.  I will be reading those.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|More secure than emailing.  Can set settings for friends only.  They are very good at notifing you if someone is trying to use your account and easy to change password.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series, that I stumbled across, is incredible. I literally could not but it down. It's a story worth reading!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My son and his daughters taught me to play this game and I'm still learning.  It's a very addicting game!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|thrashed an original 1st gen nostromo n52 until it wore out, replaced it with the G13 and am SOOO happy!!!  logitech has never done me wrong and hits it out of the park with this one too!!!  many cool apps out there but I've just decided on the Sir Real's pannel and the factory RSS reader.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset.  It is very comfortable, the sound is excellent, and the wireless range is fantastic. 40 feet is pretty accurate for the range. It has a little weight to it, but not where it is an issue. The ears swivel, which I did not know from reading about the product, and it really adds to the comfort.  The preset buttons come in handy for ventrilo when I walk to the fridge to get a drink and need to respond.<br /><br />My only concern is that with the swivel ear pieces, that they will wear out eventually, so I am being careful with it.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this purchase.
B001BEK8E2|5.0|Quality seems good and much lower price than others of same name.  The English title on this DVD made me wonder if it is still in the Japanese language.  It is, and it has English subtitles (I did not try to turn off).  Interesting story and good acting.
0142419400|5.0|This book (after re-reading it over and over) has become my favorite book. Ever. It's just perfect to me. Stephanie writes in a perspective that I feel is 100% relatable. I love Anna despite her flaws.<br />Then we have the setting for this book. The most wonderful city in the world: Paris. Every time I read this book I feel like I'm there. Which is great because I've never been and can't afford to go! But this definitely helps my Francophile feelings.<br />And then we have the most important aspect: the most wonderfully dreamy and amazingly crushable fictional boy character I have and will ever have read about in my life. Guys. He's British. He can speak French. He's GORGEOUS. And despite being hopelessly flawed just like Anna, you will fall madly in love with him.<br />When I read this book, STILL, I have to put the book down at certain points and just squeal or scream my head off. I'll never get sick of it. This is just the perfect YA romance in my opinion.<br />And please read Stephanie's other book, Lola and the Boy Next Door! (Only after you've read Anna though! You'll see why) Seriously, this girl is the master of swoon-worthy cute nerd boys.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly continues the Harry Bosch series with another good book. The twists and turns are great and I look forward the next Bosch book. I love seeing him move through life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you love Solitair you will love this addition  When playing random shuffle it make it a real challenge to win so you have to stay on your toes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the simplicity of it!  It's very detailed and easy to understand!  Very good game if you like horses
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Found this story to drag a little compared to usual Reacher series. Still entertains and quick read. Still look forward to more Childs' work.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like Majhong Artifacts a lot . Once you start it --its hard to stop. The figures are a little hard to see because they are so alike shich makes it a  little harder.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Plot stretched though not unusual for Reacher. Love the Bad girl villain and 'mother'.  Wanted to finish it in one sitting.  Always an easy read.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is so much fun. My daughter-in-law found it and called and said to get it. She was right we both enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one was so much better than the last one personally. I really like the minecart part in this one.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game a lot.  its really fun. the only issue I have with this app is that I played it all day and I turned off my kindle and I went back to play it again and I couldn't. it went to a black screen and that was it. i couldnt play at all. so I had to uninstall it and re-install it. BS!! I hope it doesn't do it again because if it does then I'm just going to uninstall it and keep it that way. but other than that problem the game was really good and fun to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|hello if this got submitted........ love this game did not know awesome games exist........ oh....and add me as giddyguild308 and I will add you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|o m g this app is awesome no problems its like 1 2 3 or a b c if u don't have it get it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game so much. If u can't do it as a career do it with this game. Lol
B007FG9LIE|5.0|A terrific piece by Crouch.<br />He draws such a wonderful mystery around the protagonist.  I felt as uncomfortable as the character for most of the book and had no idea where it was going.<br />Crouch never disappoints, however, and I read to a thrilling and thoroughly imaginative conclusion that spills with your own hard-won conclusions as fast as you can make it to the finish.<br />I can't wait for more.<br />And what a compliment to hear that the book is in development for a tv series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I recommend this to all temple runners. I know that this is a higher wit game. I LOVE this game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This just continues to irk me & yet I keep playing when I want something entertaining to do @ lunch break.  Each new level is exciting & one just KNOWS the next bird sent into action will beat the level...NOT!!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It didnt even have my printer which was a very popular epson model. Waste of time and space in my opinion.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|It is very sad and very risky the casualties are very smart and can think of things all the time before something happens
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a very good game. i like survival because you have to build your own houses. It is very fun running away from creepers
B002PNDEXK|2.0|Other than Emma Thompson being way too old to act as a nineteen year old Elinor, Hugh Grant(Edward) looking absolutley stiff as board, Alan Rickman(Col. Brandon) looking as if he was sleep-walking throughout the movie, and Kate Winslet completely overacting Marianne, I suppose this movie is okay. If you haven't seen any other version this might seem great; but after seeing the BBC adaption, this doesn't even compare... Don't waste your money- get the 2008 BBC version.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It is very funny and cool to play. I like it because you can build your own vehicles. It is very funny when the pig's vehicles and them crash! You should play bad piggies .
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love playing this game. it so relaxing. the music is peaceful, the game is soothing and the tanks are beautiful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It hit so close to home in so many ways. Definitely gave me hope and strength.
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|This first album from Manchester band The Stone Roses has often been singled out as one of the most important albums released in the 1980's. I can not disagree that this is an exciting and beautiful album and will not hesitate to give it five stars. On the other hand I feel that there is a tendency to overestimate its impotance when compared with the best of the Beatles, the Kinks and the Who. This serves neither the group nor the album, as it inevitably will lead to disappointed listeners with the wrong expectations.<br /><br />Enough said about this; to the album and its music. Musically  group seems inspired by the American sound of the midsixties, created especially by the Byrds, but also a group like The Bobby Fuller Four  easily comes in your mind when you listen to specific songs.<br /><br />First and foremost is melodic pop-rock music spiced occasional sharp edges and psychedelic guitar solos.<br /><br />Most numbers are actually very well put together, but obviously tracks like \\"She Bangs the Drums\\", \\"Waterfall\\", \\"Do not Stop\\", \\"Sugar Spun Sister\\", \\"Made of Stone\\" (the songs that first made me think of Bobby Fuller) and \\"Shoot You Down\\" first and foremost will capture new listeners' ears.<br /><br />A pity that the group never managed to fulfill the promises the debut album gave, and the group dissolved after a disappointing second album.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I was a big fan of Phillip on Idol and was so glad that he won.  I think he could become the next &#34;Boss&#34;.  This album is so fun and heartfelt.  I usually play it over and over as it doesn't get old to listen to.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed.  Never heard of her.  But WILD came my way and her writing blew me acrosss the room with it's power, preciseness, beauty and honesty.  I don't think I've read a book of this quality since Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird.  (I'm glad I didn't let Oprah's Book Club recommendation put me off.)<br /><br />When I began, if I had known what was between the covers, I would have held on more tightly.  Cheryl doesn't waste time.  Chapter one:  `Ten Thousand Things' is written with a surgical precision that doesn't come easily.  It must be worked for....let me rephrase that.  It must be bled for.  Sobbed for until gasps replace breathing, until unconciousness provides a drop of relief.  The words vibrate with accuracy.  Each one perfectly chosen for one particular place on the page.  Doubtless she is her own editor, tirelessly playing each refrain until it is without flaw.  The mechanics are perfect.  Every word fits, every phrase passes smoothly to the next, every page builds the story, the book, the journey. Wait until you get caught up in the content.<br /><br />Not many years ago, Chery's mother died.  Cheryl's inner void filled with dispair and it grew.  Getting off track took time and getting back on track would be no different.  The first few chapters set the stage. The remaining chapters journey along the Pacific Crest Trail telling a trenchant personal story, unusually raw, always focused.  Hiking toward a better place:  Oregon.  The Columbia River.  The Bridge of the Gods.<br />A powerful read.  Literary craftsmanship along with honest and bold content. Excellent by every measure.
B000NA1XSA|4.0|Quelle surprise, the reviews and comments to Here, There and Everywhere a continuation of the never-ending feud about who was the best Beatle.<br /><br />So, about the book. I found it an interesting read that became more interesting as it went along. Yes I was a bit surprised at the dismissive comments about George, Ringo, and even John's musicianship. (Although the sketches of their personalities rings true to what I've seen and read elsewhere.) I can accept the fact that George might not always have been capable of rendering the sounds Paul wanted for the lead pieces. This says as much about Paul's authoritarianism (and pride of authorship and creation) as it does about George's ability, at least to me. It would not surprise me at all if Paul could get the sound down he wanted and had conceived faster or better than George could. That George Martin didn't care for Ringo's work on Love Me Do is also well-known. And I'm willing to acknowledge's Geoff right to call it as he saw it. Bear in mind also though, that simply because he was \\"there\\" this does not preclude his, or perhaps his coauthor's, possible interest now in stirring the pot a bit to make the book controversial and thus perhaps more worth purchasing. Geoff pointed out the commercial motivations even the Beatles had in rushing out product that he felt might have been done better with more time.<br /><br />Perhaps I found most interesting the post-Abbey Road material, as it was new to me. Other than Geoff's opinions, most of what went before was not exactly revelatory.<br /><br />I do suspect that some of the earliest conversations might be what might have been said, rather than what was said, or might have been mashups of bits said in separate conversations. This can be laid off to literary license as well as lapse of time. I would have liked even more technical details. It's interesting that Geoff acknowledges toward the end that he was not someone with a grasp of the theoretical or scientific aspects ofrecording and acoustics. He certainly did have a native ability to apply what was before him to help create the sounds. I'm grateful for that and that he finally came round to putting it down for a book, before there aren't any of us left who can appreciate what it was like hearing it in the moment.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this game is so awesome.it is fun and I highly suggest getting the coin doubler as soon as you start the game if you like it.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I did not expect to like McEwan's latest novel after reading the reviews and only read it because my book club made me! I later thanked the person who recommended it, because I found it most enjoyable on several levels. McEwan uses Sweet Tooth to discuss readers and reading; why we read; and how men and women differ in their reading tastes. And that's pretty amazing because the novel is (supposedly) about a young woman who goes to work for the British Secret Service in the 1970s and what all that was about: London before Margaret Thatcher, class differences, family dynamics, emerging feminism, political intrigue and so much more! I related to Serena in her 1970's mind set...so naive about life and love and what she wanted. That's what being 20-something in that time was like. &#34;Girls&#34; is now. Serena was then.<br /><br />So now I'm wondering why I gave it four stars instead of five. I think it was because of the descriptions of the short stories. Five star novels are seamless and this one was not, but it was well worth the journey and it's one of my favorite McEwan novels.
8866131350|4.0|I get one of these purse calendars every year because I love the way the week is laid out with lots of room for notes, love the bookmark and elastic closure, love the substantiveness of it. What I do not understand is why it needs to be 18 months, which just makes it 50% thicker and heavier.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was a great game but now it doesn't let me open it . I see the I but then it brings me back to my home page. HELP!!!!!!!!!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great job on this one!!! Really<br />love the new levels, it is very challenging. Zip lines are a nice touch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm all caught up!  Thanks to Amazon Prime!  If you are a Pride and Prejudice fan, you have got to see this show.  Start at the beginning.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really addictive game. It's the best if you just have some spare time. I start playing as soon as I get into bed to the point I'm falling asleep.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Poor story line.  Humor even less sophisticated than the &#34;Family Guy&#34;.  Basically, if you don't like the Family Guy you probably won't like Ted.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|If you are a Black Crowes fan or a Chris Robinson fan you need no review because it is exactly what you expect a great cd with hints of Garcia,of course!Highly recommended!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector portays what could very likely be what wars are like and how they are fought in the future.
B008HK3RVY|5.0|This cover fits my iPad Mini wifi +3G perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase! Five stars for timbuk2 on quality and design.
1603427244|5.0|I had been checking on line for good cast on's and cast offs. I was glad to see some I had liked covered here and used both for knitting a sweater and binding off some toe up socks. A nice compact little book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read!  Usually I have two or three books going at one time.  Not this time.  Excellent twists and turns.  Anyone who likes Grisham will thoroughly enjoy this novel.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|very impressed with the qulity for the price,i have paid more for watches with half the qulity.would recommend invicta watches and Amazon service!
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I happen to have always been an Anthony Hopkins fan. I highly recommend this movie, not only because Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance, but because this is a classic done right. The acting is first rate, the plot moves along at just the right pace. This is a real winner with excellent entertainment value. I highly recommend it.
B000002MUN|5.0|Tom Petty makes great music..This a fine example..Buy it! I did, Every song is a gem.It's awesome! Petty fans must have this one.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|My first buy of a Taylor Swift record, I was mainly interested in hearing the recording and production which is top notch, but the songs, although very appealing to children I am sure, are mostly pop bubblegum 3 and 4 chord drone... Still Taylor does it with style and you can't call her bad. Now that I have the record,I probably won't be buying another by her, but I have found it instructive via lyrics, song structure and production values.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great story!  You will be mesmerize by the whole story.  How could this ever happen?  Well, stuff happens out there in the world.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I stand in jaw-dropping awe. I feel like someone has awakened a sleeping T Rex and I have watched it take its rightful place at the top of the animal kingdom. LZ come out with a mighty roar in this 2007 concert and they take no prisoners. Plant's vocals are amazing and Jason Bonham knocks it out of the park. This is an absolutely incredible event. Buy it. Play it loud. And no quarter.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Too darn many pop-ups while I'm trying to play . . . .way too many!<br /><br />5 more words required? Why?
B0034G4P1W|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He is very in to claymation and states this is an excellent example by one of the Masters of the art, Nick Parks.
B005HJU7HA|2.0|This kindle edition contains multiple spelling, grammar and formatting errors not found in the originals. Very distracting, very disappointing. These stories are as wonderful as ever, but deserve better.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Loved the &#34;climbing up out of the depths&#34; analogy. These sequels aren't always good but this one I enjoyed.<br />Check it out.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a bike messenger for Security Courier in New York City and he's the best at what he does. He rides his bike (very quickly) with only one gear and no brakes.<br /><br />He is having girl problems (Dania Ramirez) and one day gets a call to deliver a mysterious package super fast - premium rush - to Chinatown. Trying to get the package is a nasty mean NYPD detective (Michael Shannon).<br /><br />Great action shots, wonderful city footage. There's not a complicated storyline but the movie is fun, fast paced, and action packed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and very interactive. I never get bored playing this game. There is always something new and different to do.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|I love this movie will watch a million times! It arrived before the date of arrival with both discs in the package!
0062127241|5.0|I picked this from my husband's Amazon Wishlist, so I couldn't go wrong. He absolutely loved it and would recommend it to any Pete Townshend fans. If your significant other has a picture of this WHO member on his nightstand, you can't go wrong buying this!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very fun and I like keeping care or my horse. I also like how they have competitions I love training my horse for them.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|I thought that Galaxy Quest was excellent sci-fi humor back in 1999, and earns my 5 stars (my favorite character is easily Alan Rickman's Sir Alexander Dane).  I had to mention that it is interesting (perhaps a joke or typo by Amazon?) that my review is for the slightly more expensive 25th Anniversary edition(?) of the movie.<br /><br />Well, it's \\"futuristic marketing\\" for when you are really ahead of your time...
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I love the Men in Black movies and MIB3 is my favorite so far.<br /><br />Time travel, saving the world, back story...it's all in this one.<br /><br />Josh Brolin does a fab job at playing a young Tommy Lee Jones.  Tommy Lee Jones does a great job at playing himself.  Will Smith is cool and gorgeous, as always.  Jeanine Clement as Boris the Animal is the BEST bad guy so far.  And I loved Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, the all-knowing alien.<br /><br />Wonderful special effects, creepy/slimy/out-of-this-world aliens and just an all-around fun movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesome book. highly recommend for 9-13 yr. olds. Action, funniness, and suspense. Its a must read! It is one of my favorite books.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This is a great album from a great new band with a ton of promise!<br />Don't hesitate to buy this album!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprise  to see the quality of graphic  for a free game. It keep  me amused when I'm bored.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would recommend this app to anyone and have been enjoying this soooo much!!! I love this app so I recommend that they make more apps!
B0091REZMW|4.0|game is pretty good. only thing I really don't like is you get missions for placees you cant open yet. its pretty good though. it is very addicting if you like searching games.
B0091QS88K|5.0|This game has quickly become my 3 yr old's favorite new app. He plays it at every opportunity and asks for it by name. It is a very simple game, similar to cake mania or Flo's kitchen. However, unlike the previously mentioned games, there is no way to not make the correct things. The only thing I have notice as a problem for my son is that you can push some things off the screen or loose small items such as the decorations for the gingerbread people. However, if that happens it is very easy to just back out to the previous screen and start over.<br /><br />A++ for young children<br />Not so great for the older ones.<br /><br />As a note, we ended up buying the full version, since the free one only had limited recipes to make.  The full version adds another table \\"page\\" (so you can have 4 people seated) and a significantly larger quantity of things that they want to eat or drink.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game.  She plays it a lot.  Like all free game it does try to set you up to spend more money to enjoy the game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game, makes a lot of sense and very accurate. Definitely fits in to the real world and seems very plausible!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|At times it was confusing and was wondering why I bought it. I am used to playing the card game itself, but thought I would venture out and buy the auto one. No, not really disappointed, just need to figure out the kinks, if you will.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|The acting is spectacular and the movie is the best. I would recommend this movie to everyone.  Great Great Great
B006OCM0G0|1.0|All of the \\"processing \\" and force close issues with ALL of your games. The pop ups are very annoying begging us to spend our gems. The prices of the gems are ridiculous.  The amount of gems you want for your items is crazy. 48 gems for this and that, that is ten dollars CRAZY!!! Make a mistake spending your gems your just out of luck. OH WHAT FUN. It takes forever to earn the gems. The restaurant game with the new goals very annoying. TEAM LAVA YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH ALL OF YOUR GAMES!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I played this game for a few days and now the screen keeps shifting and is really choppy. what's with that?!?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is awesome! It daysit has 101 games bit it lies... it's got 132. the only reason I'm making this review tho is cuz I'm gonna get 250,000 points for it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's a good read; complex and entertaining but not Grisham's best work.  I don't feel it's in the class of &#34;A TimeTo Kill&#34; or &#34;The Firm&#34;.
B0086700CM|4.0|I was &#34;running&#34; wrong with it at first until my son showed me the &#34;right&#34; way. Then I liked it. Stars value? Depends. First you don't like it and then you are off and running. Still running with it. Hey, see it is free now. Take advantage and let me know what you think.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|But they had the formula right the first time - this sequel is arbitrary, if not nice to look at and a welcome change in scenery. Besides that, I don't get the same seat-of-my-pants dead-at-any-moment feeling I got from the original. Still, it is Temple Run and worth trying.
B008MM9630|5.0|Very very cute game! Just downloaded it....still in the early levels, but having a blast with it!! Looking forward to playing more!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is a fast paced, always on the move reading experience, and I loved the characters.  Anyone interested in thrillers will be captured from the first page to the last.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a good book it makes you wonder why you would do some of the things you do when you are drunk
0765325950|5.0|My son has read this series over and over and is eagerly reading this one now, pleased that Jordan's mammoth story is being finished despite his death.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This was a very good book. But I don't like that t the Alex rider stories are over I enjoyed them very much
0307891372|5.0|I got this as a present for my brother.  We couldn't find it at any of the stores because they were always sold out so I told him that I would get it as part of his birthday presents.<br /><br />It came in faster then other purchases I ordered with it.  Skyrim was the longest game my brother has ever played (It took him 3 weeks to go through all of the content as opposed to 2 days for all the other games he's played through) and even with the book he was constantly on the console playing.<br /><br />He's also passed the book along to a friend or two who were stuck in the game and they were happy with it as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Perfect for children its graphics are amazing my daughter now wants a pony for Christmas . I love how they give you real activities you must do to care for a horse
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Me and my sons loved it.  It was actioned packed with great suspense.  If you are a batman fan you will love this movie
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This one kept me guessing for a while.  Great story about some ruthless people planning to clip crooks  within the system and out of the system and doing it with great success. Justice served .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love to play it! It is one of the best games ever. It is easy to complete goals. It is way better than horse life adventer

B006VJMZXY|4.0|It was good, just frustrating at certain points.  I did not like the main characters very much.  I felt like they were forced down my throat with being &#34;nice&#34; characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the most awesome game in the world. I nurture adore this game it is a really fun game but the only bad thing about is I have to be on the Internet
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir of hiking the PCT in an attempt to work out some tough life issues.  I felt that I was carrying her too heavy pack and walking in too small boots.  Very enjoyable and inspiring.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This case provides great protection and the appearance of the product looks great and seems to be well made.  I would recommend this case, absolutely.  I gave 5 stars because I know of nothing that would make the product better.
B006O3MU96|1.0|Love this game on our Apple products.  My son downloaded on Kindle Fire and there are no presents to collect ~ which means can not score points and advance.  Have tried to unload and reload.  Can not locate help center on Amazon.  While this is The Best Doodle jump game yet .... something up with the download of this from Amazon.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Love the music. Classic Halo. If you liked the game, you will like these CDs.<br />Now my collection is complete. :)
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I loved the Uma Thurman version. I am also a fan of the stars of this film. I was just not overjoyed to see them all together. Many of the songs worked magnificently. There was a lot of song dialouge that didn't work as well. I felt this should have been a musical rather than an opera. I was surprised at how well the actors could hold their notes, like a professional, yet not sound as well on simpler tunes. There are also professional singers who can act (not 50 Cent). Personally I would have cast them.<br /><br />How is it all these Frenchmen have British accents? The music enhances the already rolling coaster ride of emotion of the saga, making the highs higher and lows lower. There has been almost a void of decent musicals in the motion picture industry since the 1960's. This one fills the void with a great story and cinematography. You are hooked on the film by a brilliant opening scene with Jackman surprising the bejesus out of me with his singing and Crowe does not.<br /><br />As a musical, I won't rush out and buy the sound track. Looks good on the big screen. But seriously, 5 stars? Perhaps the most amazing thing is that Russell Crowe, who can't carry a tune in a bucket, got a major starring role in a musical. Don't look for that to happen again.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. Brief sex scene.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run two is the best game ever!!! I would pay 10 dollars let alone free!!!!!!!!! buy it buy it buy it!!!!! right now now NOW!!!! stop reading this revew and get the game plz plz plz!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I loved the story of an over-looked artist who had such an impact on an important social movement.  The music is wonderful and the star is an enchanting character and artist.
B000002N25|5.0|Can' go wrong with any Mark Knopfler if you looking for a nice relaxing sound that grows on you the more you listen to it :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it es da best game ever at least this one is free better than getting one that is 0.99 cents
0316227706|5.0|So creative and talented! I bought one for me and two as gifts. Thanks for sharing a new perspective and making us laugh at the same time!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I am a real Gleek, so I loved watching the season again.  Will enjoy watching again and again.  Highly recommend it for all you Gleeks out there.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Well researched, well written, and an eye opener.  Perhaps some of the author's points are even too well documented, but the writing is so clear and concise, and organized, that sections of superfluous detail can be skipped without loosing thread of thought.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is even better than the Son of Neptune. But I did not like how they killed off the main people. The way how all of the seven demigods started to get to know each other? Amazing! I can not wait until The House of Hades comes out. It is going to be another great book by Rick.
0061673730|3.0|First of all, I am enjoying the book.  I feel like I'm on that motorcycle and enjoying the scenery and the people. I'm only half-way through the book, but I can feel his remoteness from life.  His philosophical musings are also enjoyable, despite the fact that reading philosophy was always difficult for me, I enjoy them because they are succinct.  Pirsig seems to live in an abstract world despite the fact that he concentrates on nuts and bolts and what he calls Reality.  He seems to be asking for answers to those most basic questions of what life is all about, in fact struggling with those questions, but missing what I understand of Zen from the koans I have heard, for example-  Student: Master, what is the meaning of life? Master: have you had breakfast yet?  My guess is that it is this struggle which led to his psychotic break and this book is his attempt to understand why he had the breakdown by returning to where it occurred.  Maybe in the second half of the book, he resolves this struggle. I'll edit this review when I have finished the book (if I am still sane then).<br /><br />I just finished the book.  Throughout it I enjoyed his descriptions of the ride through the scenery and his interactions with his son, like being taken on such a trip with my young son.  His examining his philosophical questions became rather wearing, but for some reason I always wanted to see what he said next, even though in the end I really didn't know what the heck he was talking about.  I simplified his question about 'quality' for myself by telling myself that his conclusion was no different than Polonius' To thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.  The question of whether gravity existed before the universe did (I really don't recall this part too well) I concluded was a ridiculous question and to me it is obvious that one cannot separate one from the other and that gravity does not exist in the same way that the universe does as it is merely a relationship of parts of the universe to each other.<br /><br />On thinking over the book, I was reminded of one of the first psychotic patients I saw.  I tried so hard to understand what he was trying to say that I came to the realization that if I didn't stop thinking about it I would drive myself crazy.  Then in the afterword of the book which he wrote ten years later, he writes \\"I tend to become taken with philosophic questions, going over and over them ...until...they become psychiatrically dangerous ... and now the question became obsessive (of)'Where did he (Chris, after he died) go?' I also became obsessed with this question after my father died.<br /><br />Bottom line for me on this book is: 1) the motorcycle ride with his son is an enjoyable read, 2) the philosophical stuff is ultimately incomprehensible, and 3) the book seems to be an attempt to understand himself and his psychosis.  I think he was compelled to write this thing just like Willem de Koonig was compelled to paint the way he did, but with regard to producing something useful such as Newton's outlining his laws of motion, I would call this book a failure.verse does as it is merely a relationship of parts of the universe to each other.<br /><br />On thinking over the book, I was reminded of one of the first psychotic patients I saw.

034580404X|5.0|I just love EL James' Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy! I bought them originally on e-Books, but when the 12 Days of Christmas came around and I was able to guy all three paperbacks for $4.99, I would have been stupid to turn that down!!
B00797MB0O|4.0|I can't point to any specific moment in the film where I noticed that I was enjoying what I was watching. However, as the end credits rolled, there was a certain contentment that settled within me. Surprising satisfaction at the uncertain ending? A reflection of my own darker thoughts about moving on with life? I don't know, and I know this sort of movie doesn't hold the widest appeal, but for my two cents I enjoyed it.
B00422LESO|4.0|Funny if you like historical piece or love Austen, really makes me happy I found my Mr Darcey right away
B0042UEU8M|4.0|I loved this cute lovable movie. Just settle down with some pop corn and warm blanket for a two tissue night out with girl friends. Zac is lovable and should be cloned. I would recommend this move to my girl friends
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really a good time consumer. fun to play, good for my kids too. love that I can train my horse but buying new horses is way to much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am glued to this book.  I'm about half through it and I can't put it down.  Still haven't figured out the \\"who dun'it\\".It is getting more and more interesting and tangled.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well-crafted science fiction with a fully realized world, and a fresh take on the overdone post-apocalyptic collectivist society genre.  The concept of 'the cleaning' is clever and original and serves as the foundation for the story rather than a sci-fi novelty.  The author is stingy with details and backstory - much of what we learn about the characters and the world is inferred through dialog rather than confirmed through exposition.  There are occasional problems with pacing - especially when characters are ascending or descending the silo - but this is a minor complaint for an otherwise excellent book.  It remains to be seen whether Hugh Howey will join the ranks of Heinlein and Clarke, but he outshines many of his contemporaries.  That this book was originally self-published is remarkable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|cute and fun my seven year old loves this game a d there's no big pool to clean up lol bye bye
0446310786|5.0|I only wish I could have read the book before I saw the movie so I could have visualized the protaganist Father on my own....however, Gregory Peck is quite acceptable.  A classic.
B0086700CM|4.0|I'm not sure I will be able to get past a certain point in this game, as I make a mistake sooner or later and have to start over. But it's mostly mindless, yet engaging fun as you run! Great free game! If you have quick reflexes, you will probably do better than I will! Give it a try!
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Couldn't even finish reading this book.  This has only happened 2 times in the last 3 years.  That is how  bad this book is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love all the new things and the ziplines are cool the bigged monkey is better than all the little monkeys I just love it

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Temple Run is funner that the first one because it has better effects and better challenges than the first one. I hope you enjoy. :)
B002ZG97EC|4.0|This is such a cute movie for children and adults. I love the picture quality - it is so vivid. Only thing I'd add is for it to be UV.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I could not put this book down. It's an amazing journey with the author through a trying and enriching experience few of us have the guts to endure.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|I order this and found it inconvenient to always need to remove my kindle so I purchased a second cover that allows me to use the kindle and the cover remains on.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Not normally a fan of YA, this book kept me captivated the whole time.  I loved the characters and the story.  Brilliant.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think temple run 3 is very fun. Once you play you will become addicted. The way you slide down on a ride and roll in crates in the tunnel makes the game 10x better. This is a game everyone must get!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Exactly as described. Extremely fast shipping. Took me a few mins to figure out how it would hold the kindle up but that was fail on my part. Very easy once I figured it out
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! if you love my littile pony (or your kids) get it! have funny with all the differents ponys
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First reviewed on my blog, [...]  Hopeless centers around two main characters, Sky & Holder. Sky has been homeschooled all her life, and has not had access to the internet, tv or cell phones because her adopted mother doesn't believe in technology. For her senior year she finally convinces her mother to let her go to public school. The first day she meets Holder, who is intensive, incredibly sexy and really intimidating. Sky senses there is something different about him, with his ever-changing moods and the many rumors surrounding him. That doesn't prevent her from getting to know Holder and they soon start to fall in love... and the mystery surrounding Sky's childhood starts to come undone.    Hopeless was amazing. It was like an addiction that I couldn't stop. I actually devoured this book... and I dreamnt about it when I wasn't reading it. I was absolutely enthralled with Sky & Holder's whirlwind romance. I couldn't get enough... I almost wish there was a sequel because I am in LOVE with this book.    I really liked Sky. She was tough on the outside but displayed softness when needed. I also loved her ability to still be able to think in touch situations. Granted she did have a few breakdowns, but she kept her head on her shoulders and was a very strong character. I also loved Holder... but no surprise there, I always adore bad ass, tough, tattooed sexy guys. I also adored Sky's best friend Six. She was so rugged, sarcastic and horrificly honest. I wish she played more of a part in the story.    I was absolutely astonished by the quick turn this book took. I had no idea Hopeless was going to touch on such serious topics, and the ending had me shell-shocked. I felt so many emotions reading this book, it literally was an emotional rollercoaster.    I am so happy I recently purchased Colleen Hoover's other two books because I cannot wait to read more from her! I love her writing style; it absolutely captivated me and had me clinging to the edge the entire time I wasreading this.    If you love new adult, contemporary, romance and books that touch on serious issues absolutely read Hopeless... you will not be disappointed!

B009RH973I|5.0|I love it, especially the pink color.  It's so slimline that it fits right into my purse for easy transporting.  I can always have my kindle at my fingertips.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Left me with a very peaceful and optimistic outlook on life and death. Recommended for those &#34;doubting Thomases&#34; like me.
B008476HBM|4.0|I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Maybe my expectations were too high, but I barely laughed at all while watching this film. Please explain why listening to a stuffed animal swear and have sex with a human female is funny. The lines weren't funny at all. In fact if Ted were human we all would be saying how badly written the film was. I guess some people think that the fact that the lame comedy was coming from a stuffed teddy bear makes the lines funny. Based on all the positive reviews, the American movie going public is easy to please. Not this guy. I am very happy I paid only a dollar and a quarter at Redbox for this garbage.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is amazing I love. it is like taking care of a real horse. it is fun and confusing at the same time.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Michael's CD \\"Michael\\" is GREATER than most CD's out there today.<br /><br />Behind The Mask is one of my favorite on this album. It reminds me of the Michael in the 80's.<br />I love this albmum with the exception of one, the voice or Michael was changed a bit but I gave this<br />album the highest rating because Michael's work is exceptional.<br /><br />Love you Michael!
B001684L0A|5.0|Paul Giamatti brings John Adams alive in a way that words fail to describe.  Laura Linney is perfection as Mrs. Adams.  The story is gripping and delightful.  There is humor, heartbreak, and this series will just totally pull you in.  You won't be disappointed.  Word to the wise.  Go to the bathroom before watching....The funny parts will make you pee your pants, and also you won't want to pause for anything it's that captivating.  Also get a box of tissues...the sad parts are heartwrenching but are what bring the story to life and make you truly appreciate this part of our nation's history.  Interaction with the seller was also flawless.  YOU MUST BUY THIS!!!!<br /><br />I have watched the series NUMEROUS times!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome<br />I love it UN belie bible I love it it is awesome awesome I I i
B007TNS6JI|4.0|It is a decent time killer. I would like more options for upgrades while offline where most of my game play time is available.
0446573019|5.0|good read and great characters with a brand new hero.  another baldacci hit.  i love john puller, the hero.  he can save me anytime.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|I love this game, but don't play it before bedtime.  I do wish it had more scenarios, but it is exactly what it says it is.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I am so glad I came across this app!  It is awesome, so many choices. There is something for everyone. I also loved how you can set the timer to shut off so you can drift off to sleep listening to your favorite sounds. Get this app, you won't be disappointed!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|We bought this for my daughter's kindle and she absolutely loves it.  It is a very nice case and looks really nice too.
0545265355|5.0|Suzanne Collins is truly one of the worlds best authors. The Hunger Games trilogy contains twists at every turn, and you just cannot stop reading. The conflicts Katniss has with not only other people but herself make an interesting read, and Suzanne has managed to bring her to life, such that you feel all the emotions that she feels. The grief, the joy, the anger at herself for causing the deaths of so many. The final book has to be perhaps one of the best finales ever written, and even long after you finish the book, you still stay awake at night, thinking about it. It's truly a flawless book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It freezes up every so often on my Kindle Fire. Also, as to be expected, money money monry if you want the cool things, or enough energy to do things. Still cute, though!
B004OKFIYU|5.0|Billy Joel's &#34;Piano Man&#34; is an album that I think just about everyone grew up listening to......or if not then everyone has heard the title track umpteenmillion times!  But the fact is that this album is just so much more than that great piano bar infused mega-hit!<br /><br />  &#34;Piano Man&#34; is a little bit pop.....a litle bit country.....a little bit folk....and a little bit rock..<br /><br />  The &#34;Ballad of Billy The Kid&#34; or &#34;Somewhere Along The Line&#34; for example could have been lifted off any of the early Elton John albums with a full fusion of piano, honky tonk'isms, pop , rock and orchestra.<br /><br />  This is the 2010 Mobile Fidelity SACD version mastered from the original master tapes using their Gain 2 system which has produced some other excellent discs.  I was greatly impressed with Mofi's other Billy Joel's SACD's and this one I feel is equal to them.  This may be the warmest and most balanced recording actaully of all the Mofi's I own.  At higher volumes this disc just keeps its warmth and richness.  At times I can hear things that only a high res recording like this could possibly reveal with as much definition as it does.<br /><br />  I especially love  the tone and mix of the bass on this recording........nice and definite with deep plunks.....<br /><br />  My personal favourite song on the album is &#34;Captain Jack&#34; which I think really ends this album on a &#34;high&#34; note.........get it ?<br /><br />The music is fantastic.....and so is the sound !
B00881PPTO|5.0|Great app - lets me search multiple travel sites in one step, just like I do on my computer.  Haven't even played with many of the other features, because I just want to be able to do flight searches.  This is exactly what I wanted in a Kayak app.
0439023521|4.0|What's not to like about this book? It's one of the best-plotted books I've ever read, with intricate detail and page-turning action. I can see why it's such a cultural phenomenon. I haven't seen the movie yet but can't wait to. Definitely recommend the book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I dig the versatility of this alarm clock. I have it set so I wake up to the Word of God instead of aggravating bleeting. Then, just to make SURE I'm awake, it allows you the option (which I use) to complete math problems in order to shut it off. AWESOME
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked it it's the best horse game that I have seen so far. I think that you should get it
B008GBCMHO|4.0|Great movie for kids and adults as well. works well on download. My 8yr old grand kids loved it. Thanks
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this game! It lets me have fun with horses when I cannot get out to the ranch to play with my own ponies. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because quite often I have difficulties with the game loading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for an easy and simple calculator and found it. I like the fact that displays the result and the last operation at the bottom...<br /> Love the big numbers and the color scheme. Nice!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've given Temple Run 2  a four star rating instead of five, only because half the Times I've died and used the &quot;Save Me&quot; button, the game freezes, force closes, and not only takes away the amount of gems the &quot;Save Me&quot; called for, but doesn't count any progress from that run. So I'm down however many gems, cheated out of an 8 million point high score, and less a few thousand coins.<br />  I love this game, but something's gotta give on that glitch. Please fix.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun sequel to Temple Run, and I find the sequel more fun, and also easier than the first one, but the thing I dislike is the turning of the screen as you move along, and the height we at  at, since I am scared of heights and the height was pretty elevated, and on the turns at the beginning I wasn't feeling so well. Now I am used to it though! Great game everyone!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this show, partly because of the gorgeous costumes but mainly because of all the various plots going on at once.  They servants story lines are great and well, let's just say the story lines upstairs are nice and juicy. I also love how history is woven in, whether it be the Titanic or the war, you get a real feeling of the times they are living in, I mean, who can comprehend waiting for a newspaper boy these days to get news a day later. Well-written and full of gorgeousness. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed!
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie is the best of all the Marvel movies!!!!! Very well executed and the action and storyline are excellent.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm hooked ! I'm loving this game can't wait for the next one. I really like the story line and the graphics are pretty good for a tablet. ;)
B003INBOE2|5.0|It is as everyone says. Ip Man is more than just a martial arts movie.  It has great fight scenes but it also has so much heart, story, and character.  It is an excellent movie because it is well rounded, fun, sad, and powerful.  This is a must-own movie that you will want to watch over and over.  At least I have...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So nice to have Amazon Prime to watch first two episodes free. Also love you can purchase the 3rd season before it ever plays on tv.
0425252868|5.0|This book is so nicely written.  It reads simply, quickly, and beautifully.  This is why I feel that history buffs will be disappointed.  Typically, historical accounts are long on citation and often lose the flow needed to really love the historical depiction as a reader.  This book is cited and researched, but it's not obstructive.  It just reads like a wonderful story.  You don't have to be a historian to enjoy this book.<br /><br />Mostly an account through the war-life of Stigler, this book taught me so much about living during the war for a German soldier. I'm sure there are many accounts that would satisfy the same thing, but gosh, this one just reads so well.  Stigler was not a fan of the war, not a fan of the Nazis, but a guy who loved to fly.  I learned many things through the eyes of Stigler and the writing of Makos.  Thank you both for sharing this story and teaching me things I never realized.<br /><br />If you're an aviation buff, a history fan, or just want a book that will really let you enjoy reading history, I highly recommend this book.  It won't bog you down in heavy context or aeronautical physics, combat tactics and other deeply technical information that would distract from the book's true message.  It's just the story of two good men caught on opposite sides of a fight.  The message is as relevant today as it was in their times.<br /><br />It's just... a good read.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game with its middle ages style and amazingly fun app create your dreamworld of myth and magic<br />With amazing creatures<br />And wise animals
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. It was funny and easy fast reading book. Great love story and chemistry between them was perfect. I would recomend this book to my friends.
0765325950|5.0|It is bittersweet to have such a familiar part of our lives come to a close.  As with anything that a person devotes time and energy to, we have a vision of what the end will feel like - of what it *should* be.  This book wasn't necessary what it *should* have been - it can't be exactly what the original author intended - but I think it is a great ending, capturing the essence of the intent, and holding true to the \\"The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\\" flavor that permeates the series.<br /><br />Did everything happened the way I wanted it do?  Heck no.  Nor should it have - I didn't write it!  If I had known how it was going to end, the strife, the sorrow, the joy - I wouldn't need to read it.  But I didn't know exactly what was to happen, and I feel fulfilled that I finished it and it was a fitting end, even if I didn't get everything I wanted out of it.<br /><br />Does Brandon write these characters as well as Robert Jordan?  Heck no.  They haven't been living in his head, part of his personality, for the past 20 odd years.  Did he and Harriet do the best they could in a less than ideal situation?  I think so.<br /><br />The book, above all else, made me feel.  I laughed out loud. I cried out of sadness and happiness.  I was shocked several times, and some of the shocks were good, and some were bad.  Was some of this due to my 20 years with the series?  Yes.  I was also moved by both the writing and the story... which came from two separate people, and were weaved together to create the pattern, if not the exact words, that RJ intended.<br /><br />I would say if you want the author to read all of our minds and make everyone happy, then you probably aren't going to be happy about this book.  If you want to read the story and get lost in it and appreciate it for what it is - no more and no less - join RJ and Brandon and Rand, Eggy, Elayne, Min, Mat, Perrin, Faile... all of them for the last battle.
B0099114WO|5.0|I squirmed and laughed alternately through this movie. The largest part of the story is spent trying to breathe life back into a stale and stagnant marriage. This might sound dry and hopeless but the incredible skill of the unlikely couple of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, lend more than just credibility into the lighter moments and they reach deep inside you with the painful moments and share a knowing kind of pain in such a way that by the movie's end you can relate completely. It was painfully dry in places but it served a purpose - to make you feel what they felt in the husk of a life gone dead. Brilliantly done by all!! It is frank and funny, and deliciously, emotionally raw.I found myself taking notes on what not to do in my marriage and how to live my life more fully.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle writes an important and inspirational work in A New Earth. He describes the higher potential available for humanity if we but awaken to our life purpose.<br /><br />This is an important book on a number of fronts.

Secondly Tolle outlines a way to get there.<br /><br />Given the shambles of the world we live in, with ever increasing problems arising from unenlightened solutions implemented by unenlightened decision makers, this is a people's book with some insight into how we can best create the better world ourselves.<br /><br />Nicola Grace, Author of [[ASIN:B00APUUCJ4 Discover What You Are Here To Do: Follow The Clues, Find Your Path]]
B007MU85D0|3.0|I purchased this CD primarily for the song &#34;Little Talks,&#34; which I really enjoyed. Most of the songs sound very similar in style and execution, which makes it somewhat boring to listen all at one time even though individually they're pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm 11 and my friend recommended this game and I totalty love this game and I recommend this game to anyone who wishes they had their own horse and I wish I had my own horse and now I feel like I really have one.
B001O5DR3W|4.0|The movie could have been much better if it wasn't for some of the unnecessary changes that were made compared to the book. Nonetheless, it is wort watching.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I loved this game up to the point I exited the game and it failed to save my progress. I had completed the main game and was part way through the bonus chapter.  I exited the game and when I re-opened the game it wanted me to sign in as it did when I first bought the game. My original player name was gone - as was my progress up to that point. The bonus content was locked and the only way to unlock it was to re-play the game from the beginning. Frustrated doesn't begin to describe how I feel. G5 needs to fix this problem. Up to this point it was a very good game with excellent graphics and a fluid story line with good hints and helps along the way. But a game that does not save your progress is a deal breaker.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|An excellent novel - would thoroughly recommend; ma now looking to seek out other Kate Morton novels;<br />This has an unexpected outcome!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I got my video before the expected arrival date which was an awesome surprise!  I would recommend this dealer to anyone that wants quick and efficient service!
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I really enjoyed watching the movie, so I bought the soundtrack right away. I thought the songs they picked were good, even if they didn't use all of the ones from the movie, which was strange since the cd is only 30 minutes as is. They're were also a bit out of order, but that wasn't a big deal.<br />The only disappointment I had about this soundtrack was their &#34;battle&#34; sequence. The Backstreet Sample wasn't the lead singing by herself then being joined by the others, so it didn't have quite the build of tension I was expecting.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved these books! Only wish there were more to read so I could see how the rest of their lives pan out!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas, he was thrilled that it was a 3 disc set of classic Stones song, and newer ones too. He was very happy with it. A great gift for Stones fans!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is an awesome sequel to the first one amazing graphics too, just it keeps freezing on mine or lagging. Pl ease fix
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game can sometimes be fun but ummm... this only gives you like what 15 MINUTES? It should give you more time... and sorry but this game to me is kind of a rip off of minecraft. Its fun but just needs to be a little bit better.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|this is very helpful and I have thought thus was useful for school and with my two brothers and my parents

B004N6369Y|3.0|Can a book be too readable/predictable?\\" Why, yes, it can.  This is a pleasant story but without much intrigue.  When tension is introduced, the tension goes on far too long with no plausible reason.  A Danielle Steel Lite tale..
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I've tried several white noise apps and I must say this has got to be one of the most comprehensive and useful apps I have encountered.  Honestly, you MUST try it to appreciate it.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I was very pleased with the charcoal cover.  It does make the tablet a bit thicker but still fits in my purse.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I'm not sure if it's possible to love Reflected in You if you don't enjoy romance novels replete with whipsawing emotions, passive-aggressive behavior, and constant break-ups and drama.  To love a romance novel, I need to be able to lose myself in the story, but while reading Reflected in You, all I could think was how I would never want to be in a relationship like this; I value my sanity too much.<br /><br />I like Sylvia Day's writing - she kept me engrossed and her writing style is worlds beyond THOSE OTHER BOOKS.  The sex scenes were hot - both sensual and erotic.  I liked Eva, I wanted her to be happy, but when she wrote this in a letter to Gideon: \\"I hate myself like this.  I hate that I need you this much.  I hate that I'm so obsessed with you,\\" I just couldn't be a cheerleader for this romance.  Gideon is nowhere near my ideal of the perfect man, and my feelings about him impacted my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I get the hype, and I understand why a lot of women find this kind of romance appealing, but I'm just not one of them.  I am glad I read this book, though, because it erased some of the bad aftertaste from THOSE OTHER BOOKS.  I would like to read more from Day to see how she handles different characters and a different kind of love story.
0451232852|4.0|I enjoyed the mix of fact and fiction and looked forward eagerly to the second book in the Trilogy. Recommend to those who enjoy history.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book was one of the most entertaining I've read in a long time. It follows the misadventures of a 100-year old man who has lived a very full life and has happened to be in the company of some of the most influential people of the 20th century. I chuckled all the way through...
B00006LFGD|5.0|She has a voice like no other with a very wide range.  I could listen to her all day long

B001NN4162|5.0|I love this movie, and am so glad it was finally released on blu ray. a very fun inspiring movie for all ages
044024367X|3.0|I've been reading the Jack Reacher series in order since October 2012, and this is my least favorite so far. There are three basic plots in the book, and in my opinion, only one of them was really explained well in the end.<br /><br />I'd love to hear from other readers who possibly saw something I didn't and can explain this: there is one very dramatic scene where hundreds of the residents of Despair are mobbed on the outskirts of town, each with some weapon like a metal rod or something. They stand ready to attack Reacher and Vaughan, screaming the word \\"OUT\\", crashing of weapons, \\"OUT\\", crashing of weapons, \\"OUT\\", crashing of weapons. Reacher and Vaughan beat a hasty retreat to fight another day. Are all these hundreds of people in on the plot of what's ultimately going on in the plant? I find that highly implausible. Reacher kept predicting in the book that the townfolk were all working in expectation of some big payoff, willing to risk their lives for the greater goal. What was the goal? Surely not the \\"dramatic\\" conclusion of the book?<br /><br />I'm still a Jack Reacher fan, but this one left me disappointed. Oh, and just a little irritation--the whole Hope and Despair names were just a little too precious for me.
B0052GACNM|5.0|What a talent he has the best easy listening voice around now in the 21st century. Absolutely fantastic & a joy to hear.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love reading Rollins' work. He keeps things moving fast and exciting.  Recommend to read any of his books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome I could play it twenty-four seven I love playing the games and grooming my horse it is so much fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!! It is so realistic! The horses in the game... you can wash them... you can train them... you can brush them, and its super fun! You can also clean the stables as a cool mini game. :) I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS APP. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!
1603429999|5.0|Right now i am working through the different techniques, I am a self taught knitter with less than a year under my belt. this is an eassy to understand, step by step, with lots of photos, it is a go to to figure out if your doing it right  or need to change your ways. Many patterns are now being written to work in the round, so it is a skill that is almost completly necessary. Not many 2 needle patterns left. Thoughtly enjoyed working with this book.
B003MDDGTE|5.0|Love this album! I plan to buy all albums released buy the Foals in the future. They are one of my favorites.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is music to die for.  I had this LP way back in the 60's & after moving house many times it went missing.  Dave Brubeck was a very talented pianist with Paul Desmond on Sax, Eugene Wright as bassist & Joe Morello they make magic music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting easy read. Great for a family and can talk about but with friends. Look forward to seeing the movie
B0050KEVO6|4.0|This is an interesting game. I is not always intuitive as to what to do or logical, but it is fun. You will need to find a website for cheats or this will take a lifetime to finish. I never did.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Covers so many topics in one single book.  So very well written it all comes together in a book you just can't put down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really became involved in this book emotionally and found myself talking and laughing and aweing out loud. Enjoyed the progression and figuring out each reveal!
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Movie was slow to develop and expected much more base on the trailer.<br />Glad we rented it first...would have been even more disappointed had we bought it for our collection.
0547391005|5.0|I brought this book for my 3 year old son. It has become the go-to bedtime story book.This is just like the curious george that I remember as a child. The illustrations are colorful and the info on the authors complete with photos were a plus for me. I recommend this for everybody.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was pretty skeptical about this book and put off reading it for a very long time. I'm so glad I decided to read it! Give it a try. It's was way better than I would have imagined. I haven't seen the movie or previews so I read this book completely unmolested which I am grateful for.
B0096PYUE2|3.0|I wanted a flashplayer for my kids' Polaroid tablet. It didn't work for that, so I am not sure how it works.
0452273331|5.0|Having read this in 12 days flat performing no other mind-intensive act, I can surely say that this literature is engrossing to the extreme.  There was no room to multi-task and reading this book came first before all other leisurely activity.  I was entertained but also enlightened; reinforced as well.  A masterfully-told tale.  If Atlas Shrugged was a TEN, this is a simple ten.  Read it and decide for yourself; individually.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Phenomenal book I couldn't set it down! I can't wait to read the rest of the books. I am starting then right away
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This is an item that came up while I was playing a different and more advanced form of &#34;Jewels&#34; family of games.  It was not as fast and the graphics were more old school than I would prefer.  The game I prefer id Jewels Legend.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Screen cover made touch screen less responsive. All of the buttons are very difficult to use. Silence button impossible to change.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It's the usual fare from Nicholas Sparks. Predictable but a good weekend read. I'm a fan but never overwhelmed. I still recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|If you don't already have it then you probably live in a cave and don't have anything to play it on anyway.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was addicted to both season 1 and this season and I'm not a big tv show person.  You grow to love or hate each character and  I love how each season thus far incorporates such in depth story lines that keep you guessing and wanting more.  Normally, shows that portray demon possessions and alien abductions seem ridiculous, but you really are taken in to their world and it feels mysteriously natural!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a cute game my 7 year old loves it so much great for all ages as well .. great way to pass time..
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Great film which is both a Holicaust film, and adventure film, and a film of coming of age mentally rather than physically.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 4 year old had me download it and now i play it more than she does. Very addicting and better than Temple 1
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it makes me angry n it brings my firends n i together in a small group wen its played so its worth it
B005HSL626|3.0|I never play it, but it keeps my kids entertained. It is self explanatory, easy to learn and destructive. Just what kids like, right?

B001TH16DI|4.0|I liked the set, with on exception. The directors cut of the motion picture should have been included in the set or made the default. I also liked the extras.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for all ages and genders! You don't even have to be in deep love with horses! You get to care for many horses realistically with nice graphics! Everything looks real. It's like actually caring for horses, but for free.

B007N5YIUS|4.0|A interesting twist to the Angry Birds saga. It is interesting and a pretty decent departure from the usual original game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|You found the right tv show if you're looking for real tension and good scenario with intense scenes. Horror story, period!
1741798981|4.0|This felt more like a phone book than a travel guide at points.  It sort of attempts to list everything it can, selectively, but it doesn't give a whole lot of detail.  There aren't really any pictures, and the paper is a bit low-quality.  Again, kinda like a phone book.<br /><br />I thought a guide focusing on London would be more in-depth, but I actually preferred the Fodor's guide to the whole of Great Britain.  Not only did it somehow feel more in-depth, even just for London, but it had such great background information.<br /><br />I sort of think that maybe Lonely Planet wants to be more exhaustive (despite their admission that this is impossible), but while doing, they provide such little information specifically, and in addition so much useless, extraneous information, that they end up feeling a little clinched.<br /><br />We carried our larger, Fodor guide with us everywhere.  It was a pain, but it was a really useful, fun book.  This one mostly just stayed in my gal's purse.<br /><br />That said, it's certainly far from a BAD guide.  It's great, just not what we ended up feeling happiest using.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|When I got this app I felt like I was in the game. The only problem is that when I'm lying down in my bed I can't move the person left or right. I don't know if it's my kindle fire or if it's the game itself. Anyway the game is fun and addictive you should get it!!!! &lt;(^_^)&gt;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good! Couldn't stop reading it!<br />The story was awesome from beginning to the very end. I definitely recommend it to all.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|its alrite i guess its xute for a stickman n u cn draw ur own but rlly kind of boring rlly
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This is an entertaining app, but not for a very long time. It gets more fun the more alcohol you consume. I am not promoting alcohol consumption.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Yes, full of awful puns.  Yes, mostly about the pretty clothes and actors and setpieces.<br /><br />But I really liked it.  They performances sold it well enough for me to really get with it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Formulaic with at wist at the end . Flows well . Written for the movies or TV.Overall a quick read and pleasant way to spend an afternoon.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Wow. I am absolutely blown away, by Rick Riordans and first instalment of Heroes of Olympus. I will be purchasing Son of Neptune, today. But, the book... it was quite amazing, I think of it as a \\"spinoff\\" series of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which is basically what it is. The book overall was just as great as Rick Riordans first series. Rick is definitely a legend in my eyes. Great job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lovely game. Horses, chores and training are all realistic and fun.My 3 year old enjoys helping clean and feed our Beauty as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|it cn b addictive worth the download but dnt spend to much time on it ur eyes will start hurting
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I don't rightly know why they just don't put this app on as standard software. It really is needed and used by a lot of people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best solitare app. No freeze ups like the other ones. Ireally love this solitare app and I totally recommended it
0307744434|4.0|Loved the \\"magic\\" of this book.  These characters are worth the read...Very imaginative.  Kind of wish there was a book 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love her writing style so much I have decided to read her other books as well.  It is descriptive, yet flows. I couldn't put Gone Girl down!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a pretty fun game I like the ziplines and other stuff I recommend this game to all of my freiends
B0064T6LV8|5.0|i love pinball no matter where it is i lik to play it on my computer n kindle n fone
B00B2V66VS|5.0|what can i say FANTASTIC great game good graphics good way to spends some free time. Better than temple run 1.<br />Nice crisp colours.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Was hanging out with a friend today and this is what we jammed out to. My daughter also loves jamming to it! Love me some Shania!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent writing and very interesting story as all of his are.  If you enjoy his writing (and who doesn't), you will be glued to this book.  Hard to put down.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney shared her joy and happiness over the birth of Christ in the many songs she sang in this CD!
B009ERK35W|5.0|eXistenZ, make sure that you spell it that way; for David Cronenberg is one of our top artists with this 1999 release and, sad to say his most recent effort last year disappointed me royally and wound up on my worst list. Anyway for those of you that like the weird and surreal in your cinematic efforts this one is definitely for you. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law are compelling and wonderful in this sci-fi thriller which was Cronenberg's first original screenplay since 'Videodrome' in 1982. Not for the faint of heart and it's full of laughs which ease the tension and always has me guffawing every time I see it. Knock yerself out with eXistenZ.<br />\\"Death to Realism!\\"
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it passes the time n i had it on my ipod so i downloaded it on my kindle fire n it rlly does pass time
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a former NATO fighter pilot who flew in Europe, I related to this story.  I have flown with the modern German Air Force and have great respect for them.  This story rings true and pulls at your heart strings.<br /><br />Highly recommended for everyone, especially those who have not been there, done that.  It gives an honest insight into the spirit, comraderie, and bonding between those in the aviation community.  War is an especially strong glue for that bond.
B0048HUNGW|5.0|My Mom had this CD and gave it to me. I wound up breaking it after a long time of having it. It broke my heart cause she gave it to me the year that she passed away. So automatically ordered a new one. Not the same one but was able to replace it and that's all that mattered. Thank you so much.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I've purchased several now for friends who all give this film the same great review.  Just like being back in the Rock Crazed world of long hair, torn jeans and wild inocent rebellion. Very competitive priced at Amazon.com.  Fast delivery, too!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney's singing abilities can not, will not ever be ever be duplicated, reciprcated, copiedin no way fashion or form ever!
030746363X|3.0|I felt this book was more for a younger person and didn't quite fix me so I gave it to my son-in-law. he did like the book so it became a great fit for him.
B00632HWOG|1.0|i hav to delete it thn reload it  juz to sign out of my acount if my sister wanted to check her mail
0736092269|5.0|If you need a book on basic kinesiology, this is it. Well illustrated and written, this book will become a go to for anyone serious bout weightlifting.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome! I was skeptical and concerned that the bluray feature might bring out film flaws. But I am very happy to say that I was wrong! My husband and I could not get over how clear they ALL were. It was really neat to watch the old original 4,5 and 6 and feel like they were movie theater quality. I have to say the sound was the biggest difference, incredibly crisp, clear and strong!
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Good story based upon the comics. At first the CGI was a distraction (especially the over-sized noses), but it soon came to embody the comics transition from paper to movie screen. By the end I was thoroughly enjoying it all.
B000077VR3|4.0|I heard a radio DJ say, &#34;I didn't like it, but I can see how a gay guy might.&#34; Secure in my own machoness, I bought the DVD. This is a fairly quick moving musical comedy, love story, tragedy. I enjoyed it. For me it is largely a comedy. The movie got either good or negative reviews when it first came out. Not much in between. Ian McGregor's and Nicole Kidman's singing was a pleasant surprise.
B00466HM28|5.0|I am very happy with this product for the price. The pads could be a little more sensitive, but for my purposes they work fine. I have had no trouble at all with it and I am glad to have purchased it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|pf course youtube is worth it  or u cn juz use the internet but easier access i guess . . .
B008FOB124|4.0|Muy buen trabajo. Un gran retorno de Dead Can Dance luego de años de ausencia...Anastasis es un trabajo que esta en linea de calidad a los primeros cds de DCD...lo siento tan gotico y oscuro en los 80's mas un toque de fusion de musica arabesca que le da la cereza en el pastel...\\"children of the sun\\" y \\"Opium\\" son geniales...
0062200909|5.0|As a fan of The Hobbit I enjoy reading it. The drawings are beautiful. I love all the details they designed for the film. Well done Weta.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have now read this book a second time. This is one of Grisham's stories that you can look into more than once and really get into it. Great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game is good because i like horses abd it kinda show how tp take care of a hotse so ehen i get mine i already kno
B008PWUYC4|4.0|This is a great cover.  I really like how it snugs my kindle, and it feels sturdy but not bulky.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Dude I love these books! George is seriously a GENIUS! I cannot wait for more books to come! &#60;3 cannot stop reading!
B008AU7F3C|5.0|Excelente y brillante disco...como todo lo que Natasha hace musicalmente, este cd no podia ser la excepcion...de inicio a fin es un trabajo bien consolidado y muy bien logrado. Varios temas son de lujo y memorables...super recomendable este cd; al nivel o inclusive superior a sus dos anteriores trabajos.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love the LOTR soundtrack. The soundtrack of The Hobbit does not disappoint me either. The dwarf/erebor theme is by far my favourite. I hope the complete recordings will be released.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was so good.  I do not know if I want to ruin it by seeing any film adaptation, but I probably will not be able to resist the temptation.  Smoking hot with a plot. Now, it just does not get any better than that.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Another great read, easy to follow and not wanting to put book down.<br />Looking forward to more from Lee Child
0525478817|5.0|Book #10 Read in 2013<br />The Fault in Our Stars by John Green (YA)<br /><br />I knew this was a cancer book.  I knew it would be an emotional read.  What I didn't know was that I would love Hazel and Gus so much.  These two were great characters.  The pair meet at a cancer support group.  Havel has cancer.  Gus had cancer and lost a leg to it.  The two connect at first through Issac, in the support group and Gus's friend.  Issac is going blind from his cancer.  Gus and Hazel have an immediate connection and they fall in love, despite Hazel trying to fight that from happening.  But young love is never easy, let alone when cancer is involved.<br /><br />This book was a great read.  Readers will come to love these characters and yearn for their happiness.  Green is an incredible author and his writing makes this not \\"just another cancer book\\".  His writing immediately embraces readers into the lives of these characters and the plot surrounds all.<br /><br />[...]
B000002G8L|5.0|Arguably, one of the best live blues/rock albums Eric has done, and how far does one have to go to beat Eric and Albert Lee combined?  Great timing and emotion.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|My 12 year old son loves to play these escapes games and I enjoy watching him. He certainly is better (and more patient) than I when I play. Would recommend to those who enjoy strategy games.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Received order earlier than I expected. Brand new and in the original packaging. Grandson was happy to received this DVD for his birthday.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a dyed in the wool Grisham fanatic, I am always amazed at how he comes up with these terrific story lines.  Just wonderful!!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Excellent application and recommended for mobile devices. It is very diffrent from any pdf reader. I have used it with nexus 7
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This has been great. Easy to download and install on my tablet and has given me many more books to chooe from.<br /><br />Woody
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh my, Ana and Christian. What a story!! The story was way more than it seemed in the beginning. I love how these two people grew together
B002N7P23I|2.0|The hand held camera thing is getting old!<br />Actors are sub par and cheesy and moldy and not all that pretty.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Haven't played long but not in love with this game yet. Impossible to get gems and just very time consuming.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Not a fan, as it is really not my genre.  Don't wish to discourage others, it is just me.  Sorry.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I absolutely adore the Big Bang Theory. I can watch episodes over and over and over, and never get tired of them. Amazing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book was impossible to put down.  John Grisham's writing style is terrific.  I am looking forward to his next book!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is definitely one of the best games you can own for the PS Vita. The amount of content and the depth of the game is fantastic, and rather fluid on something as sleek as the Vita.<br />Pros:<br />Gameplay lasts for a long time, you can take a casual approach or a hardcore approach and still be really happy with it.<br />Awesome features in this version, a huge improvement from the older Persona games.<br />Story flows well, a year can pass in your mind even if you've only played the game for a day at most.<br />English dubs are really well done- sometimes you forget that Japanese voices were the original.<br />Cons:<br />Not much to gripe about P4G. I just kinda wish there was an option to toggle different voice settings (English -&#62; Japanese, vice versa).<br />Lack of aftermath when you finish a Social Link. Very few events take place after you finish one. Would've preferred more extras with characters like Yukiko or Rise (you're limited to events like Christmas Eve and Valentine's Day with them).<br />Conclusion: If you've been looking for something to give life your PS Vita, look no further- this is what you need.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|I really enjoyed it.  Good sounds...different from what I expected, but nevertheless I am glad that I downloaded it! : )
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's credentials lend credence to his experience.  Some of what he found echoes events in my own near death experience.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Not exactly a comedy but a nice touching movie for a calm afternoon with beautiful scenes<br />from Ireland. Definitely recommended!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I absolutely adore the Big Bang Theory. I can watch episodes over and over and over, and never get tired of them. Amazing.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|It keeps the filters clean and well protected. The clip on the front is superfluous. The velcro closure is all I use.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A childhood favorite to revisit in the cold days of winter or anytime you're looking to escape to another world. Stevenson is craftsman of the finest cloth, weaving a tale of pirates, murder, mutiny, and fortune.<br /><br />The language and imagery carry readers away with young Jim Hawkins in a tale offering an uncomplicated morality of being careful what you wish for and asking what is the price of treasure.
0064471837|5.0|This is an excellent quick read, with a well thought out story. The first of a great trilogy with immediately recognizable character types they are easy to identify with.<br /><br />I have re-read this several times, and am sure I will be re-reading it again in a few years.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Good Chess game. I've played a lot of different computer chess games in the past, this is the first one I tried on my phone. Works very well.
B002NWOOXW|3.0|But Hugh Grant doesn't have a long role in it. Overall and interesting comedy. And yes, it's worth watching absolutely.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I absolutely adore the Big Bang Theory. I can watch episodes over and over and over, and never get tired of them. Amazing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves horses. This game is awesome. Took to long to load though!!! Horses are beautiful and game is lots of fun!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I thought for sure this was going to be a waste of time.  This game is addictive!! So glad that I started playing.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I like the sci-fi aspect and the true life aspect of this movie. Good action and a good story line.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Graphics are much too small for my android phone. Would be a nice puzzle game for tablet or computer. Instructions were not very clear.
B000ICZCZS|4.0|This is one of the best movies of Hugh Grant. Funny and interesting and has a good story and streamline. I enjoyed it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Nicely done adaptation of original novel.  Keeps true to Boroughs within the limitations of Hollywood and time.<br />Warrior Women Rule!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so fun for me and my little sister. I enjoy horses so this is one way for me to learn how to care for them.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Comments about better graphics are true, but I've dropped off cliffs that never rendered and the game crashes when I try to use gems on revives.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|great app if you like to wait forever to load and hope it works this time. I don't get to play on kindle fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a good book. I might read it again in my next life. Love life peace on the earth
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I never miss a movie of Meryl Streep and in this one she's phenomenal.<br />This is not a comedy that make you roll on the floor but it is very thought provoking<br />and deep. Besides beautiful scenes from Paris and fashion industry, you'll enjoy<br />great dialogues and unbelievable acting of Meryl Street and of course Anne Hathaway.<br />It shows some aspects of work culture and also the narcissism of success at the same<br />time it reaches the deep soul of a person who is supposed to be the &#34;Devil&#34; but is as<br />human at heart as anyone else.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, great for the weekend or anytime that you want to watch a<br />wonderful movie. The picture quality is good but with instant videos I always have some<br />problems with the sound volume but I think that must be a problem with my computer.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great game much better than first graphics upgraded game please pretty solid everything's pretty good.justice fun but 10 * better than the last 1yeah
1451675046|5.0|Read this book and then gave it to my little brother. This is a great introductory book to science. Dawkins really shows how wonderful and enjoying science and reality can be. Growing up in a religious household I felt my brother really did need some reality. My mother is a fundamentalist and believes every word of the bible. Needless to say, this creates a very anti-intellectual atmosphere in our household(of which I moved out). This book is what every child and young teenager should read. Highly recommended.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the detail Mr.Martel used to bring the entire experience of Pi to the reader;it drew me into the experience.  Absolutely loved how the book ended.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not sure how she is going to end the series. I will just have to read on and find out.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Bought these as an exact replacement for the bright yellow headphones that came with my Sony Sports Walkman (that I bought back around 1994 and still use).<br /><br />These have been my favorite headphones forever! Lightweight, great sound, stays in my ears while I'm working out. Earbuds never fit me and fall out.<br /><br />Will be buying a second pair as my 11 year old keeps &#34;borrowing&#34; them ;)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved every second of this book i would recommend it.it's just amazing and sweet and interesting as hell. Any and every one should read this book well not little kids . Lol
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because finding the murderer was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. As usual, Harry comes through. He gets help from an unexpected person in the end. I found the information about tracking the gun to its roots very interesting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger games trilogy is the best I have read so far.  I had to read these to keep up with my teens and could not believe how well written these were.  I hope everyone gives them a chance.
0765325950|1.0|Problems:<br />Too many flash-scenes: character scenes cut away without resolution to the subplots of the chapter, and the scenes have no reason of not being condensed.<br /><br />Two Rivers archers: for the love of God, could you at least have spared us of the magnificence of the 500 longbowmen and how they can pin the wings off a fly at 100 paces.  I get it, they're great, but why does every battle involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers seem to pivot on these guys.<br /><br />Demandred: where do I begin....  For the past 8 books, we have had a very, very different description of this Forsaken, as someone who is level-headed (relatively) and cool.  Now, at the last battle, all he seems to do is run around the battlefield screaming for Rand to show up and fight him, all the while graciously allowing heroes to duel him in sword fights one on one while his army watches....<br /><br />Mat Cauthon: as another review mentions, this book does make Mat into a caricature, and Mat's humor is completely lost, replaced with a feeble attempt at mimicry.<br /><br />Rand's battle with the Dark One: 10 pages long altogether.  Not nearly enough both in breadth and in depth of philosophy.<br /><br />The strategies of the \\"Armies of the Light\\": don't make any sense.  If you know that the enemy is split into three forces, why would you split your armies into three forces to meet them?  Why not crush them one at a time, since you can teleport your army anywhere on the map? Whatever happened to shielding people's dreams?  Even if this was a weave that only Moiraine knew, she is now on the field.<br /><br />Clever uses of gateways in battle: Androl is the only one to do anything interesting, and even he doesn't do enough.  If you have gateways and cannons, why not park your cannons somewhere far, far away (in a warehouse or a cave), and open up gateways to the enemy front lines whenever the cannons have been loaded, rather than putting them on hills, exposed to the enemy to know where they are?<br /><br />Moiraine: almost no payoff for the wait.  She does nothing for 700 pages.<br /><br />The Black Tower subplot: a completely unrealistic and easy resolution to the plot.<br /><br />Dialogue overall: very modern, and very much out of character with the rest of the series, and it annoyed me that suddenly people were picking up modern warfare diction, without any precursors.<br /><br />Fighting: too much with too little substance.  We have already been exposed in the previous two books to many battles, both magical and regular.  Couldn't you focus on the big picture more and hack and slash less?<br /><br />Happy endings: too many.  Brandon has some pet characters who he dedicated to having happy resolutions.  At no point in the story did you feel like you didn't know who was going to die and who was going to live.  And I'm not talking about foreshadowings.  When Elayne was in danger, you knew that nothing would happen to her, simply because bad things didn't happen to people.<br /><br />Overall, incredibly disappointing.  This book feels like Brandon wrote simply because he had a contract he needed to fulfill, not because he had a passion for it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Nice game fun to play all ages adults and children hours of game play all varieties of games and puzzles
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a lovely and heartbreaking story. It deals with young love, suicide and abuse. This is a very talented author.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play all my coins that regenerate while I am offline and than exit to play another game.  This game is relaxing and I enjoy.  I am not impressed with the Coin Dozer Holiday edition though. While offline it resets the coins in neat rows and you end up missing some coins every time you come back.  Stick with this original edition for an enjoyable and relaxed game.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I was already a big fan of this film when I ordered it, and was completely pleased by both the disk, and how it was delivered.  Very satisfied.
0142410705|5.0|A lot of reviewers seem to rate this book lower than some of Green's other books. This is the first book by Green that I read, and it is still my favorite. I think a big part of the problem for many people is that it's not as realistic as some of his other books. Being a child prodigy is an unusual thing. Being a child prodigy AND having had nineteen girlfriends with the same name is downright unbelievable. I like unusual, unbelievable premises like this. There's plenty of realism in my real life; I don't require it of fiction.    Another problem that fans of his other books might have, is that this book is far less dark. If you're reading because you want to cry, this is not the book for you. Go with [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]] or [[ASIN:0525478817 The Fault in Our Stars]].    I love this book because I've always loved the idea of prodigies, I love interesting stories, and I love the way Green has incorporated math into the story. I think the value of math and the incredible types of puzzles it can solve are not very clearly taught or understood by many young people.    Recently, someone who read my book, [...], told me that my writing reminded her of John Green. I could not have been more gratified. I would never presume to make such a claim myself. John Green is an amazingly talented young adult writer, and he has certainly been an inspiration for me in my own writing (though perhaps my stories are even more unbelievable than this one.) I highly recommend An Abundance of Katherines for anyone who's willing to accept a little fantasy.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Waited along time...Finally this came...I'm happy with the selection and will always enjoy her music...Some have tried to copy her and it just can't be done...
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have had this game on my computer for a long time.  I was so glad to find it for Kindle Fire.  I play it a lot and like it very much.  Will be looking for more games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|an awesome game going under ground sliding on ropes jumping over river play this game and you will never delete this game ever.
0756405890|5.0|Storytelling perfection as close as it comes. I can't wait for the last book of the series to come out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lol this is the reason i can't keep my kindle charged....lol it has great graphics and i love the new places you can go on this game :)))
B000002534|5.0|One of the best albums of Santana, yet so very hard to find. I used to listen to this music endlessly in the late seventies, still remember every sound. The quality of the music is lovely, only the plastic cover of the CD has a crack, maybe due to the shipping. It doesn´t matter, I'm very pleased with it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The 2nd book is so much better than the first.  It is written better and I got more involved with the characters this time.  Can't wait to read the final book!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I like this game very much&#62; I would rather it didn't try to sell me more games while I'm playing it.  I will probably try some of the other Mahjong games eventually, but I really lkke this one.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It wasn't Michael Connelly's best book, but it was near the top!  I would absolutely recommend it. Wish he could put out a book a week.

B001RU2YUQ|5.0|what can i say? this is one of my favorite movies. i can sit and watch this movie over & over. it's full of action, drama & romance. if you're looking for a good movie, this is it.
B00932ANQM|5.0|loved the story line and the happy ending and to know that after all they both had gone throught in the past - they found happiness in each other -
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is a hard read a first, but when you start to feel the characters a little, it gets easier.  It's not written well, but you can still get what you need to move on to the next book.

B008KYOCA2|2.0|It does have a calendar.  I can't figure out how to edit anything, there is no help.  It claims it will send you an e-mail in advance but I can't get that to work either.  But if you open it every day your appointments are there.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Every character was a tongue in cheek mystery from a writer's (or comic's) point of view.<br /><br />Rarely have I ever said I wanted to see a Woody Allen Movie again.<br /><br />But the imagination and directing were lots of fun to talk about with friends.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|No problems yet.  Works well on my Xoom.  Nice features. Have not done anything special with it, so don't have any specific issues.  Just web browsing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome<br /><br />fun great for kids...teaches responsbility. I even enjoy playing it with my child<br />definitely should get for active in the family
0143121006|4.0|Well written and gripping. Reading it was as good as prowling the back streets of long-ago Peking. I will choose it for my book club.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Great game hope they do kits if monster because this thing is great take care and keep them getting stronger
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle app works perfectly on my Android tablet. It was one of the main reasons I got a tablet in the first place, and it was well worth it.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|To embrace uncertainty, find comfort in sadness,and accept death: this is the antidote that I have sought for years to my compulsion to have a \\"happy\\" life. Burkeman provides an insightful response to the power of positive thinking advocates who struggle to find happiness while missing the essence of a negative capability. It is by virtue of surrendering the desire to control events, secure oneself against insecurity, and gain a sense of cloture with the mysteries of living and dying that we can reach a more fulfilling form of \\"happiness\\" through negativity. The Antidote is a sound prescription for anyone who suffers with the feeling that a good life is elusive.
B00004U8PA|5.0|never get tired of watching this around Holloween. Just grabbed this last minute and glad I did. VHS was in pretty good condition.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This movie was so cute!! It was fun for the whole family!!  I even caught my sixteen year old smiling.  Amazing!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a wonderful book filled with adventure. I read this from the library and I rechecked it out so I could re- read it because my friend said that the second time she felt like she got more out of it. If you enjoy decent sized books and animals this is the book for you. GO RICHARD PARKER !!!!<br />Llama
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Can't say enought about the Story, Great writing, Great acting, Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.<br />The whole cast is outstanding - the lighting is beautiful (filmed using candle light only)  the women wore no makeup and Ciaran Hinds is so sexy  - if you love Jane Austin this is a must.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|excellent........just when you thought eno had run of tricks he comes up with more groundbreaking music.highly recommended.<br />nice package as well......
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theater...well I am a Predator and Aliens movie person so I enjoyed seeing this movie. I hope there is a 2nd one!
B000GWE44U|4.0|I watched this with my teen daughter and her boyfriend.  It still gave me the creeps, and had them on the edge of there seat.  It it a bit slow leading up to the climax, but man Jack Nicholson is worth it!!!  He is by far one of the scariest characters yet!!
1607066017|5.0|I am not a comics reader, but read about Saga somewhere and decided to try it. While waiting for my name to come up in the library queue, I read other works by Brian K. Vaughn and was favorably impressed. Saga is even better with standard ingredients that are mixed and matched in new ways for a satisfying reading and visual experience.<br /><br />First there are the star-crossed lovers, soldiers on opposite sides of a galactic war, then there is the scope of the war itself with the outer conflict and the internecine conflicts as the war devours more and more planets and solar systems and all of the characters born from these plot-points, then there is the newborn baby, a vulnerable creature, who we know survives into some sort of future because she is narrating the action and finally there are the fantastic humanoid species drawn by Fiona Staples. Is any of this new? No, but new is not necessarily always good. These are standard, old-fashioned ingredients of great love stories, adventures and space opera brought to a very high level by the writing and the drawing. I am especially impressed with Staples palettes and she seems to do the drawing and the inking herself, which is rare as far as I can determine.<br /><br />So, Saga is worth a look and a read if you are a fan of graphic novels or space opera or just good-old fashioned adventure set against an epic back drop. As I said, Vaughn and Staples aren't reinventing the wheel, but this wheel rolls well and fast and what more can you ask? Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love subway surfers because it is so addicting and i cant stop playing it and its so much fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|True love and pure friendship can withstand horrible life experiences and rise above regardless of age!  The first kiss chapter is intense!
079070546X|5.0|I love this movie regardless but I ordered the VHS to save a buck and I regret it...Next time I will order the DVD and not worry about saving a freaking dollar. BUY THE DVD
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Another good John Grisham read. Thought I knew who 'did it', but I didn't. One I didn't want to put down. Would recommend this book.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|This book is one of the set that I only wish were required reading at every high school in the country (if not the world), in that while being aimed at younger readers it presents concepts and ideas about how things work in the real world while dispelling the myths of humanity in a manner that invites critical thinking. And there is little doubt in my mind that critical thinking is a lost art in this society.<br /><br />For anyone who has read other explanations-of-science book (including others of Dawkins, Bill Bryson, Tim Ferris, etc.) many of which are excellent, this book is a quick read, a simple primer of sorts.<br /><br />For anyone trying to understand some basic tennets of modern science; tektonic plates, evolution, etc., this book is also an excellent introduction into those topics. It's a pretty quick read, and, again, should be read (and discussed, for that matter) by every citizen of this nation before too many more stupid decisions are made.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I needed to buy one episode to catch up and be ready for tonight's new one.  Another entertaining season of Downton this year!
B006R1T40I|3.0|Why do you require a certain amount of words in the review. My choice of a number rating should be sufficient
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|like the graphics. fun film. good time for all. recommend to all. enjoyable. funny, all ages will enjoy. excellent! thumbs up
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This was a great item. Some people might thinks otherwise. In the end it is up to you to decide.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The progression of the chracters are so well written you really feel you know them. It shows how the love of a good women can make a better man.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I must confess I'm not familiar with the original comic and have a very vague recollection of Stallone's 1995 movie. So, despite a plethora of good reviews, I went in with somewhat lowered expectations. Boy, was I surprised! The movie is amazingly well executed, especially given the budget. I'd say it sweeps the floor with many recent action flicks. Hey, the much lauded \\"Avengers\\" comes as an overbearing Disney toy-movie compared to the violent awesomeness that is \\"Dredd\\". Anyone in their psycho mood, looking for a fast-paced action with buckets of blood and gore galore, will not be disappointed. Better still, the violence here isn't as pointless or tasteless (hm, can we say that about violence?) as in other adaptations (\\"Watchmen\\", I'm looking at you!). It's more of a Tarantino variety: stylish, haunting, visceral, and moving the plot forward. I wish more actions films were like that. Short, gritty, and up to the point!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|TOO MANY SUBPLOTS. DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH ALL THE EUROPEAN NAMES. OTHERWISE, AN EXCITING READ.TOM CLANCY IS A MASTER WITH TECHNO THRILLERS.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We just love Bones. The characters are great together and have a fun way of approaching what is a morbid thing.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|This was a great item. Some people might thinks otherwise. In the end it is up to you to decide.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Not much to say but that it's exactly what I expected. If you want Mario fun without the Mario price, this is perfect.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Just finished the season finally.  It was good, but not as good as the first season....looking forward to the next season :o)
0761169431|5.0|Bought this for my nine year old son. He has made several origami designs and can spend several hours. Great craft.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great read. Knowing a little about some of the stuff in the book about gas mixes and atmospheric pressure (former Navy Diver, 1st Class) I found this book to be a real 'hard to put down' read. This guy knows what he's talking about. If I found any errors in technical stuff, they were extremely minor.  I hope somebody Hollywood ace grabs this and creates a believable movie. It would have to be a mixture of Robinson Crusoe, Castaways, and Apollo 13 with minimal pyrotechnics and sex.<br /><br />Steve Waterman, amazon.com/author/stevenlwaterman

B005I6EU7U|5.0|If this ever wears out I will be buying another.  I love the looks, it is easy to wipe off and it feels good.  I take it everywhere.  I love my Fire and this is just the icing on the cake.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The kids love this game cant stay off it. they are compatible wont to see who can they high score..love the new setup.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I love the Ellen show, but I was really disappointed in this book.  It was just her random ramblings and I didn't laugh too  much.  I regret paying 7.99 for it!! I did not think I wouldn't like it, but I really was not impressed with this book.  I don't think I'll buy one of her other books. I'll stick to watching her show.  :(
1905236042|5.0|Favorites include the airplane and turtle. I pulled my leg muscles a couple of times. Maybe I shouldn't try keeping up with 5 year olds all the time. Good for those young learners who can't read yet. We will do the meditative ones together and even though they are a little corny, the kids don't really notice.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This will keep me busy for a long time.  It does take thinking.  Not for the lazy.  Just wish the screen were bigger on my Kindle Fire.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The sound on the opening number is a bit mushy--in the movie, there are ocean waves crashing, which you don't know when you can only hear. It would have been better if the sound editing for the CD had used only vocal and music tracks, since you can't see the video, or at least washed the sound digitally to expunge the background noise. All in all, the songs are well-performed, but the video is what really makes the performances &#34;pop.&#34; The CD leaves you feeling the singing performances are a bit one-dimensional which doesn't do justice to Jackman et al. If you want to hear the songs done exceptionally from a music perspective, I recommend the 10th or 25th anniversary concerts instead where you have singers in the parts. The movie is fantastic--I'd suggest waiting for the DVD instead.
B000IVW25M|5.0|Purchased this movie for my two boys. Typical boys with all the other &#34;princesses&#34; they  really didn't like them.this one they loved.i should of started with the original princess movie.(Snow white)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so much fun! It teaches eye hand cordnation and... is fun! I like how the levels get harder by increasing the board size! Get this app!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The premise is great; easy to read and stylistically good. Maybe it was just me, but it seemed to get weaker at the end.  But still a very good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I only wish I was as talented a writer as this author so that I could write the review this book deserves. I loved everything about it and I was sad when it was over. It was one of those books that makes you think about the characters long after you finish the book. Loved it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|As soon as you think you have HOPELESS figured out you get thrown for a loop! It's sexy, smart, sad, happy…EVERYTHING! That first kiss had my heart pounding! Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK!
B000001H00|5.0|One night I was invited to hear a \\"local\\" violinist play Bach's Chaconne as part of a recital program. I declined the invitation since I heard the violinist on another occasion when he played tango music and pop-oriented stuff. I enjoyed that other concert but I didn't want to hear the guy saw his way through the Chaconne. It was his first time playing the Bach piece in public. So I acted like an elitist snob and said no way.<br /><br />Later that night, the woman who invited me to the recital stopped by and told me I was right, the recital was dreadful. She had never heard the Chaconne before in her life but she knew something was wrong, so she asked if I could give her a recording of the piece to listen to. She took the recording, went into the basement where my stereo was, put on the Chaconne and listened to the music in near darkness. When she emerged, she said \\"Wow, this sounds like completely different music, you were right\\". Of course everyone loves to be right, so I was well pleased with myself.<br /><br />Milstein's Bach has never let me down. His style is a lethal combination of technical accuracy with emotional depth. There are some famous recorded violinists out there ( I will not mention names ), who play Bach with phenomenal technique and give a heartless interpretation that sounds robotic. There are others who are willowy and stretch the music into embarrassing directions. Milstein does neither. He strikes a near perfect balance of heart and discipline. If you're looking for a collection of Bach's solo violin music, this is a great package.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love it. Challenging but not impossible. Soothing music and excellent graphics. Got it for free but well worth a dollar.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's better than the one for Google. It seems to give you more information without having to kick youover to the Weather Channel website.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I can't complain about this app at all. Unfortunantly I just don't like the game, I found it boring and not really stimulating.
0316232955|5.0|This book is amazing. I loved it so so much!!! I am the female version of Carson. I loved it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app.  It is the best. i love to play this game because it is like riding a real horse.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|This is just a good movie, it is entertaining as well as romantic. There is not a lot of violence nor profane language presented to<br />the viewer.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|nice give keep it that way. through email and delivered to my inbox to my email without much hassle .
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app has kept me connected with my friends, family, children and granddaughter.<br />I live a 1000 miles from all and at any time I can just open my facebook app and see what everyone is up to and how how everyone is.  Thank you Facebook ;)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one just adds to the first making you crave for more. So good it's hard to stop reading it.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It could just be that I'm not overly choosy, but this case has proven itself sturdy and reliable in spite of its relatively low price.  Some other options out there may be fancier in terms of appearance, but as far as I'm concerned, that comes second to functionality.  Definitely worth a look, especially if your budget is, like mine, somewhat strained.
B007JMW46U|4.0|The stories are very interesting.  I enjoy seeing how he &#34;reads&#34; people and things and is able to solve mysteries.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|nice give keep it that way. through email and delivered to my inbox to my email without much hassle .
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is the best, I have it down loaded on all my devices. It would be nice if they could sync the game between all your devices because I don't like that I finish a level on one device and have to turn around and do it on another.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a book you will find hard to put down. Also it's defiantly a book you won't get tired or bored reading again. I'd say this is the best of the three.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|As a reader, I'm sold on this app in terms of its compact presentation of multiple translations, its various options for searching through the text, and so on.  However, as a thinking individual, I do have to say I find its occasional reminders to 'read daily' somewhat overbearing - as though the program was designed by someone whose intent was to preach to the choir, and not to the unconverted.  In my experience, one of the most effective means of reaching out to others in the capacity of faith is through one's sacred scriptures on their own merits.  I've also always thought that forcing - or even pushing - fence-sitting individuals toward a commitment early on, one defeats the purpose of sharing in good news.  Perhaps it's just not the aim of this app's author to reach a broader audience - but if that is the case, they are missing a good opportunity via potential estrangement of their reading community.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a convient game to play at any time.  It can be played without a lot of thought or attention.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read about a non-mainstream kind of love story. I think the movie ending was made a little bit more cliche- it would have been better if they had just stuck to the story in the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the new season! I hate that we had to wait so long in the U.S. for the season when it was already available in the UK for a so long though : /
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 shades of grey your left with wanting more. Bared to you is another series that's so hard to put down. Such a great book. Read the first two I'm less then a week. Now May couldn't come faster I need the third book :).
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|As per most Adobe products, this is prone to occasional crashing, slowdown, unexpected hiccoughs both mundane and spectacular, and, of course, the effective performance of the purpose for which it was designed.  If you must see PDFs on your Kindle, this will do the job for you, and reasonably well - just don't expect miraculous speed or display effectiveness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fascinating book to read.  I could not put it down.  I cannot wait to read the next book. The author puts us right in the arena with the characters.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This can make you feel how like you are growing up and you got to do what you got to do.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Honestly, I didn't see all the hype over this trilogy. Until I read it. Holy smokes! You get addicted and can't put the book down. You have to find out what's next. Defiantly readable over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has wheat. It easily entertains me. I want more free gems. CANDY. Uh.. my horse is a beautiful creature from neverland Your Jello of it.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This was without a doubt one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Wish I could get that time back!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best! Try it! It's awesome and can improve your creativity. Also get all of the updates! They are cool cool cool!
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you are looking for a no nonsense simple game to keep you amused for half an hour at a time, this is what you want.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. I play it constantly. I have the same app on my phone. I really trust mobilityware. it has never force closed.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is GREAT!!...We bought it for our daughter because I thought it would be perfect for her age, But it was perfect for the parents too...lol....we've watched it like 10 times and still like it. It's worth the money
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it!! So awesome fun and its so easy love it like it Love it love it love it love it
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Shades of Forest Gump, life inserted into another. But a fun read. A quick read but I enjoyed every page.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Much like Band of Brothers, The Pacific creates a personal connection with the soldiers and Marines who fought in World War II.  A must purchase.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults.  Enjoyed it very much.  I will rent it again for my grand children. thanks
B001P5HI4A|5.0|My lady enjoyed this to the point I got a steak dinner. It did have a skip in it but we cleaned the cd and it works well now
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome!  I like it better than the first by far!  I just wish it had different scenery or different boards instead of the same thing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game, it is very entertaining! It is a game that I recommend to everybody! I like that the game takes thought but is still very addicting! Very fun game!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this show. I find it really run when they kill alot of zombies non stop. I love how this story unfoldes when u watch this show for the very first time. You got to watch Season one to see what happend and why these people died and came back  into Zombies thats what makes a really good favorite show to watch.  I met i didn't think i would really like this show till my dad and brother gotten me hooked to this show. I can't get enough of zombies being killed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|just started....so im still getting the handlg of it....but its a pretty good game so fari would recommend for ppl who like horses.. and taking care of animals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|much better than the original. Still super hard once you get deep into it though. the new map is great.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This is a very good cover looks good and protects my kindle fire<br />easy to install and use i love this color is easy to spot
B00942Y0TM|5.0|anything new from Disney Pixar studios I find amazing. high definition just adds to the appeal of viewing on my smart television.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I love Alanis  Morissette cd. Alanis has alot of good songs on this cd. I do recommened if u like Alanis Morissette buy this cd its worth every penny.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its a great continuation from the first game. really enjoy it. the zip line and coal mine cart is the best parts of it.
B009S33I68|5.0|The Vietnam War has been characterized as a stunning loss for the United States. After reading this book you understand that the military had it's hands tied and was not allowed to defend itself.  This is contrary to what I have been told all my life by the media. This book shows that the American soldier, when allowed to fight, is unbeatable reguardless of how they are portrayed in the press.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|My daughters recommended this book to me.  I found it slow and tedious. Having read 30 per cent of the book, I just asked my daughter to fill me in on the story. I just couldn't be bothered continuing with it. I value my time and unless I am really hooked on a book I will not finish it. Sorry.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book and can't wait to start the third!! She leaves you stranded at the end of the book.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Makos tries to hard to \\"humanize\\" Steigler.  Like all of a sudden he's is a 20+ ace...and never a word regarding his expertise or how he got there?  Come on gang..Franz was a German fighting for his country... nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />Franz Steigler doesn't need to be \\"whitewashed\\".  His actions in Dec 1943 only indicate that he had the soul and integrity of a decent human being.  If you could strip away \\"American WW2 Propaganda\\" you'd probably find  many such decent acts of courage on the part of German service men.<br /><br />Small technical errors... Makos, you don't move your Bf-109 from one side of a B-17 to the other by pressing a rudder pedal!!!<br /><br />It's a good read otherwise.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Another winner from brazen 'charlatan' Tim Ferris. This guy is great. If you are looking to bust out of  the old habits and build some strength, and get the human growth hormones flowing again (I'm 54, and muscle growth is happening for the first time in years), get this book and follow even a portion of what it purports. Happy journeys.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's a fun and different way to play Marking!  I have many of the marjong games on my Kindle .<br />Cgtmimi
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent app for creating lists and keeping notes about anything and everything. It's easy to use and my notes are accessible from my kindle, computer and phone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome much fun. I think cc that everyone should get this game that loves horse I like how realistic it is. I can't wait until I get farther into the game and get more horses
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captures how a government can control life. The struggle for survival of districts relies on war. Just like in real life.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|Typical Jodi style, She took some very different angles on some very debatable topics. This was definitely a page turner!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love the game but once you quit it wont open I'm very disappointed in that bug but the game its self is fine
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Who hasn't done something crazy and out of the norm! The characters are entertaining in coming to grips with their own fears.  The story touched a nerve in relation to how many opportunities we miss because of misplaced fears and running away.  Short...but a good read!
B00992CF6W|3.0|well I did not like this app because like I had a house and like this zombie thing came and ate me and a creeper blew up my house. so like I had nightmares for weeks and I have to take therapy for it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I cannot wait to pick up more of Kate Morton's books!  This book may have seemed to have gone &#34;slowly&#34; at times, but the plot was fantastic and I loved how she shifted the points of view to different characters.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I watched this one more out of curiosity, not knowing much what it was about.  And I was shocked at how much I liked it.<br /><br />The cast was outstanding, even the ones I normally don't care much for.  Everyone brought a sincerity to their characters that really showed through.  It's a slow movie, but it's never boring or dull.  Every moment has something that contributes to the whole, and regardless of your situation in life, it's full of moments that you can relate to.<br /><br />It *is* a sad movie - you can't help but sympathize with the main character, and even as a guy, there's plenty of times the eyes water up.  But there's some shockingly sudden hilarious moments that will have you bark out loud with laughter, totally unexpectedly.<br /><br />The journey she takes in healing after her husband's death is so well portrayed.<br /><br />Great movie, and if you're a guy with a significant other, it's one you can score bonus points for renting, and you may just find that you enjoy yourself as well.
0316056871|5.0|This book was very funny! I really enjoyed reading about how Tina Fey started her career. I also loved the fact that it seemed like she was just talking to a friend. I feel like anyone with a sense of humor would enjoy this book!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series, both for historical insights and guilty pleasure! I would recommend it to anyone who loves historical fiction.
B008XOXGL0|2.0|I'm not one for writing reviews but I can't believe how highly rated this album is on here. Heard Radioactive on the radio and that was the basis for me buying this album. The rest of the album is nothing like it; not even remotely.  It's like someone did the first track and then handed over the reigns to a very average boy band.<br /><br />I've had the misfortune to listen to the album twice, as I thought I must be imagining how bad it was first time round.<br /><br />I have probably been over-generous with two stars but that's mainly for Radioactive and the fact the pre-teen market will probably like it?
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This is a great bio, containing every detail you could want to know about Dave Mustaine. It fully entails his life from start to present day, including his entrance & shortly thereafter his firing from Metallica, to the creation of his legendary metal band Megadeth, to all the different trials & tribulations of keeping his band alive. Whether it be finding the right band members to fill out his roster, dealing with drug & alcohol abuse, or seriously injuring the nerves in his hand & almost losing his ability to play guitar, this book provides plentiful details about his journey in the world of heavy metal! A must read for any Megadeth fan!
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is good. I like it and I'm just doing this for the reward. It's not the worst game I've ever played in my life.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|Great cast, great kung fu, and great comedy. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who likes foreign martial arts movies.
B005D6O1EW|3.0|I think these fit true to size for this type of slim-lined comfort clog.  IE: they will be very roomy for a bony foot, possibly tight on a chunky foot.  I have a wider foot, but I wear a 10M.  I prefer to have room in my shoes, so I expect a 10M to have about a half inch of length as wiggle room, which is how these fit.  These fit perfectly across the toe box, and in length (I have about a half inch of room), but I almost returned these because the strap seems super long, and isn't gripping my heel.  The strap seems to be made to only grip the heel of someone whose foot is almost hanging off the back.  I own a generic pvc clog which fits a size too big yet the strap grips perfectly, because they designed their straps tight and a bit more stretchy, so that they grip but &#34;give&#34; for comfort.  This is how these should be made.  This is my first CROC, but from what I'm seeing, Crocs need to redesign the shoe strap to make this shoe better than cheap knockoffs.  I may return these but I am going to try adding a piece of sticky foam cushion to the strap first.
B00B5Q4YRS|5.0|I love Adams Apple so much and it was the perfect intro to a possible spin off into the NYADA \\"glee club\\". Just a bunch of outcasts together singing wonderfully awkward remixes. Also loved the \\"to young to be bitter\\" club.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I found it very hard to win, There are  long dry spells between wins sometimes. i do like the way the Kindle makes some of the moves for you witha single touch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I love everything about horses. Fun game to pass the time and to play around with a horse.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|Both me and the wife are Depp fans, and to a lesser extent, Jolie as well.  I'm glad I didn't read any reviews of the movie, as it was a typical 'not what you think it is' story... big surprise ending and enough intrique to keep you interested and watching right to the end.... we'll watch it again, definitely a 'keeper'... Good acting, great action, good storyline, decent dialogue, fast enough paced to not get boring.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great choice for some mindless fun. I mean that in a good way! I purchased this for something to do while relaxing. I'm interested to see if their other games are as fun as this is.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|it starts almost to easy but does get much harder fast. The timed challenges are especially hard. I love the look of the game and it makes me want to copy some of the images for crafts. its well worth it for both the beauty and the puzzels.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|It serves our needs while traveling around the country in our motorhome, It helps us decide if we want to stay longer in good wearher or move on to better weather.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|I saw this on the big screen. the work was fantastic! i believe it could become a desired way to go to concerts. we movie goers still sang along and clapped, etc.!!
B0011905MW|1.0|OK, so maybe it's my fault...but with so much to look for in DVD shopping:  the film itself, used disc quality, eg, like new, very good, acceptable, etc,  making sure it's Widescreen (my preference) DVD vs Blue Ray, most times I don't even THINK of checking the Region of the disc!  It seems if a disc is being sold in the US by a Seller in the US, it should be REGION 1, US and North America....  so I missed that this particular disc is Region 2 (Region 2: Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt ) until I put it in my new Sony BR/DVD player and it wouldn't play!!!  (Dammitt...)<br />Fortunately, Amazon makes allowances for returns, so.... had to download the return label, and reorder the correct disc...<br />Now, something else to check before buying!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Couldn't put it down! Jodi Picoult writes amazing stories- this being one of them!!! Glad it was on the top 100 free at the time!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has written yet another addictive compelling story. Twenties Girl is a great book and it keeps you guessing and laughing. Lara and Sadie have great chemistry. Twenties Girl is a great book to put on your summer reading list. I would recommend it for ages 14 and up. Beware you can't put it down once you start reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app was great. I loved Temple Run 1 and this one has even more action. My sister and I love this app. It is so addicting. If you liked Temple Run 1 you are sure to love the second Temple Run
B008ELUEQC|3.0|what can i say here. having been a fan ALL these yrs because of his unique voice and personality, hearing him sing Christmas songs is a treat.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|As a big Charles Bronson fan, I've seen his 'The Mechanic' many times now.  Though not as 'technically proficient' as Statham's character, Bronson's character seems more believeable to me, and Jan Micheal Vincent a more acceptable student of the dark art of assassination, er, 'mechanix'...  I accepted Stathams character ok, but to take that unmotivated, obnoxious, lazy and subversive son of the victim and turn him into a sucessful 'mechanic' seems counterproductive and farfetched.  How do we know he even had that 'aptitude'?  We don't!  It reeks of connivery in script writing, forcing a part that doesn't fit into the script to 'make it work'... but it doesn't for me.  I may watch it again, for Statham's sake, but not as often as the original!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so fun a little harder but very fun and way more awesome graphics in Temple Run 2. Wouldn't you download it?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There is only one problem with this game, and that is that it is so addicting!Love it! Download it, so like stop reading this, and GOOOOOO!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Crazy. Good! Could hardly put it down. Would recommend this to everyone.  I've never given five stars to any thing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much better than the last one. You go to different place, get different characters and it has multiple obstacles to dodge. But recently, when I tried to &quot;Save Myself&quot; and It closes it self. And then the money I had in there started to disappear. Please fix this because this game is really good :)
B004EPYZOO|5.0|We bought this simply because it is a Nicolas Cage film... I was leery of the story after reading the DVD box, but it actually turned out to be an acceptable action hero flick, though a little off the established path... probably more in the 'Ghost Rider' genre than 'Con Air' type action character, but action enough and fast moving enough to keep me riveted to the screen for 2 hours!  Amber Heard is NOT your typical girly girl sidekick, she kicks a little butt on her own, and David Morse is a pleasant surprise in his typical supporting cast role here.  Another pleasant deviation from the norm is the 'not so bad' bad guy Hell's Accountant, humorously well played by William Fichtner... definitely enjoyed this one and will add it to the 'rotation' or repeat Saturday Night Movies.
B007M45PMU|5.0|first album i have liked more than 3 songs on in a while. waiting for the next one or maybe the last one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game rocks. Thanks Ive been waiting for this to come out for who knows how long. Love the game. It is fun and addicting
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun fast paced and challenging I can't put it down. I would recommend for anyone who loves solitary. Great game on the kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but for a few little things. First, it's kind of hard to earn gems. So unless you want to spend cash it will take a while to build them up. Secondly I could not find a way to change Beauty's name. Otherwise this is a fun app that I've been enjoying.
B001QB9H10|5.0|Really, the Transporter movies have established a whole new genre of action flick in my opinion.  I was never a big fan of the Bruce Lee school of martial arts, but this Transporter character opens up a whole new world for me, and I haven't gotten tired of his rollicking, suicidally skilled driving, butt kicking adventure style yet. Funny, just a few minutes into each film and you don't even notice the guy is going bald, for goodness sake!  Just waiting for Transporter 4 to hit the streets....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app on my Kindle Fire, was one of the first apps that I downloaded. My daughters have enjoyed every min of it. Definitely recommend!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|keeps me entertained and challenged throughout the levels. there are a good amount of levels to give you enough practice before moving onto the next.
0743270754|5.0|A must read for any American whether Republican or Democrat or other, whether liberal, conservative, moderate or radical, or a modern day Know Nothing
B008E6I1K8|5.0|While much of this is review for me, it is still very useful to reinforce my C# understanding and to fill in gaps like when to use a decimal versus a float or a double.  For developers new to C#, this is an invaluable book!
B004ULNJIU|2.0|I am a Transporter fan, but this isn't Transporter.... I've already forgotten what it's about....<br />This is Not Stethams best work....
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Want a great game that your kids will love? Download this game. It's free and it's fun. My 4 yr old daughter has fallen in love with this game.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Arrived in good shape. Can watch this show over and over again :) Great show!!!! Husband love it too & our friends are HOOKED now :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it. Although, I have read better written by him. Decent story line with a small amount of action toward the end. Definitely a page turner.
B00A14SQBU|3.0|Songs are ok, definitely not her best work. I regret this purchase, I don't think it was worth the money.
0767847431|4.0|Since I missed growing up on TV and old movies, I've been playing 'catch up' the last few years... and discovering the genre of<br />Ray Harryhausen special effects has been a pleasant change of pace from the current 'too fast to see it' CGI movies special effects movement....(I really hate it when even in SLO MO the CGI takes place too fast to see what happened...great example, the 'coin kill' of the Accountant in Drive Angry) at least in Harryhausen's stop action claymation you get to see each movement and action/reaction!!!  Very cool for its time, and nice to see Ray get his lifetime achievement award recently!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this app because it was free and my daughter has fallen in love with it. Every time I turn around she is on my Kindle playing it. She loves and I highly recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow. I am SOOOO blown away by this sequel to Temple Run! Great additions and great graphics is only part of this addicting sequel. I love this app and my ONE AND ONLY COMPLAINT is that sometimes when I try to save my character with a gem the app just randomly closes. Strange but this app ROCKS!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great ending of the book. I really love it. It was little sad but lovely story. :) I hope I will find something similar to read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great series by Josh Whedon - casting Nathan Fillion in the lead role was brilliant!  Action adventure, intrigue, ruthless governmental agents, wunderkind and terra forming programs gone all wrong...
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We didn't see the Harry Potter films when they first came out... so watching at home on the big widescreen TV with surround sound was a fresh treat for us.  It took a few weeks to actually watch all 8 discs, so it was WELL worth the $40 we paid for the set, which comes out to $5 per disc with Free Super Saver Shipping!!!  Great entertainment value, and the grandkids will get to watch them in years to come... thanks Amazon!
030758836X|5.0|I truly enjoyed this fast read.  It kept me wanting to read late into the night.  You will enjoy it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome you can do anything you want to there is so much to do I think this game is a 5 star thumbs up
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|This remake has incredible action sequences and an intriguing &#34;take&#34; on the story line - worth seeing again and again!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Hard to believe this was 'based on' a true story, but overall, very entertaining... decent acting, good suspense, kept me watching right to the end.  Pretty good, actually, will watch again sometime...
B009IEXKXI|2.0|found the book quite tedious ,The story line was ok but it droned on too much, found myself skimming pages to get to the interesting bits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE IT... well I thought it was a little hard at first but it is so epic!!!! You get to ride mine carts and there's a huge monkey instead of like four... what I'm trying to say is GET IT SO AWESOME!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Excellent movie bringing insight and excitement to the &#34;Firefly&#34; series - spacer western stye with a decidedly eastern flair - combines action, humor, and ethics in a wild sci-fi adventure.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This is a nice game for children to play. It uses their imagination and allows them to create and  build a game that they can plan and grow.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and I'm not a fan of all the Zombie Craze at all. When I miss an episode I can always buy the one I missed from Amazon the next day and download it to my Kindle Fire and stay caught up!
B000HKYBXA|3.0|Well done, brings the words to life and bestows new interpretations and possible meanings on the plot. But I found I enjoyed it better when I was looking half the time at the text. Captioning it (I watched on Amazon Instant) would have made it for me. Nevertheless, another stellar performance by Branaugh and other fine actors who are intelligent enough to interpret Elizabethan English.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was great!  I enjoyed the way it was written.  I would definitely recommend this.  I didn't want it to end. I wish there was a sequel.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed the movie... almost a 5 star... Until the last 15 minutes. The end \\"fight scene\\" seemed to last forever and then the movie was abruptly over. We both kinda looked at ourselves and scratched our heads. But, we enjoyed it overall and was definitely worth the rental!
B00006FI2Z|1.0|the region 2 or any region other than 1 should not be listed with region 1 but put in a list for these other regions You don't expect to purchase a dvd that you can not watch
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I can see why the Beach Boys have been in the music business for fifty years.The way they harmonize and bring melody lyrics and all that great stuff together just makes this cd so great .
B0090O07S2|3.0|Overated a bit and a little short, was hoping some of the songs were the long concert version and the end of the concert was cut out.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Big fan of the show beginning this season.  Bought all seasons except 5 since I watched that one live or rather DVR'd. Blu-ray or not doesn't bother me either way. Show was great although the DVR case was too well sealed!! Ended up accidently breaking the plastic trying to get all the &#34;sealing&#34; tape off of it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I definitely got pulled into this story. The characters, their struggles and triumphs and their viewpoints on life (and the side effects) was very well written.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER IN THE WHOLE INTIRE WORLD AND NOW THERE IS TWO
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I hadn't read the reviews when I bought this book,I took a chance on it going by the rating! When I read the first few pages,I thought It was going to be too young for me,but it drew me in!I liked the characters,even though I sometimes found Holder to be a bit unbelievable at times,and I wish the Author had brought their friends into the story a bit more! I saw all the twists before they unravelled,so in that way it was a bit predictable,but.....I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book,it touched my heart in a way I didn't expect,and left me thinking about Sky and Holder even after I had finished the book,and the kids whose story this could be on a daily basis,and the more this subject is brought into the open,then the more children may be helped,so hats off to Colleen Hoover for dealing with the subject! You won't regret reading this one!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It grabbed me early on but tended to drag toward the end. I think King handled the subject of JFK assasination and the concept of time travel well, and as always King's writing flows easily.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|works great, holds my kindle securely. The only challenge comes when charging. It is necessary to completely turn the device around to plug it in.
030758836X|3.0|I started reading this book several times and finally decided to get to the end. The book was ok not great and I as many other readers are very disappointed with the end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this app! The graphics are awesome. You can take care of your own beautiful horse by feeding and grooming. Also competing is fun. Take pictures and share! Fun Fun!!
B003Q6D25U|5.0|Great movie to add to my series of horror movies, I kept looking for Paranormal 2 in stores and I couldn't find it anywhere.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I wanted Google like I have on my computer.  Google is a great search engine, but this app is not good.
B009RH973I|1.0|I returned this case in a matter of a week after receiving it.  The back part of it was great.  It offered a lot of protection to the Kindle, however the front 'cover' was not great.  It was very thin and flimsy, not at all what I had expected.  If they could change the design of the front cover to make it more sturdy and 'book like' then they would have a winner.
B0095VPBFY|4.0|Bought to power my living room HTPC. Works flawlessly--included heatsink was a quick install. Runs hotter than Intel but a great bargain.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Good movie. I enjoyed the whole final destination series, and I needed this one to complete my collection of videos.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was interesting in a lot of ways. I thought it was going to run along the same lines as other space books but it's humor and vivid language set it apart. Good read and worth reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to take care of horse but I can't in vote friends . But it is really fun hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This app is as addictive as the other Angry Bird apps. I don't know if this is good or bad.
1419705849|5.0|My eight year old loves this series and this book is no different!! He could not put this book down!!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|The steaming quality was very good with Qwest DSL (40mbps).  And the movie is simply an incredible story.  I wonder...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a yeasy game but yet fun all you have to do is jump duck and run.I injoy playing this game.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a very good game good graphics!If you get it you should love me.It is a very challengeing game.Have a good time
0425166805|5.0|This book appeals to a unique population of readers. My husband loves it and he cannot put the book down.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|It is a wonderful substitute for my home white noise machine while traveling. I like having the option of setting it for a nap interval and having it mute notifications while leaving the sound on for the app is excellent. The only problem was that when I clicked on the link for downloading additional sounds Google warned me that McAfee has found that site to be full of spyware and malware and to stay away. That's ok since it came with plenty of choices for sounds already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I reviewed this several months ago and did not like it very much..Now this is much improved and the app runs perfectly. The new challenges are great additions. Highly recommend.
0143121421|5.0|Le Carre, as many have noted, is still the globe's pre-eminent espionage writer, and Limas is for my money his greatest creation. Yes, even better than Smiley. The anti-semetic angle, in the shadow of WWII, gives this tale the weight of history itself. Mr. Le Carre, please keep up the good work.
B00136NTAI|4.0|For a true Men At Work fan this album is a must have.  You will either love it or hate it.  I don't think there is an in between.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This a great app to share things with friends and each can Pin It and share with each other what ever you want.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Excellent! Well worth the money to upgrade from free version. Highly recommend this game if you are in to hidden object games.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|As with the other two Men in Black, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great.  I can't wait until the Men in Black 4 comes out.
B00000251N|5.0|The book was great and the movie is a great addition to anyone's &#34;oldies&#34; library.  One needs to appreciate the movie to love the music.  Neil Diamond is always a great listen.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the first season of this series. It was only out for two years. I wonder why Amazon charges so much more for season 2 than season 1? Come on Amazon, get your act together!
B00969PR18|1.0|Downloaded and tried this on a lark.  Deleted it after I found that it placed the mobile device approximately 1/2 mile WEST of my location.  I had downloaded and was operating this device (Kindle Fire) off of personal wifi within the home.  I checked a couple  other addresses and had the same problem.  Placed address in wrong direction from closest cross street.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|The story is good but the book is less realistic and dramatic than the movie.  I found the anthropomorphic telling of the story from the horses point of view quite old fashioned.  It is, I think, a book written for teen agers but the style is weak compared with modern teenage books
1400049628|5.0|This is probably the best book to get if you are looking to survive for a hypothetical zombie apocalypse. I highly recommened it to anyone who likes reading and just general surviving.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG! I love this game it's better than temple run with rope swinging, Bridges I love it. I could play it all day. I'm totally gunna recommend it to my friends.
1451695195|5.0|Once I picked up and started reading ,I just could not put back down.  It only verifies what I always knew....heaven is real and we all get to go there...LOVED IT!
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|I was really excited about getting this game but after I had it downloaded I was not able to play it. I would hit the app  it would take me to the game and then right back to the download page. I tried again the next day and the same thing happenned. Unstalled it and will not install anything again by G5. I'll stick to BIG FISH games. They at least work!!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Lastpass  is THE essential password management system. Having their app accessible on every platform is just one reason why. The Lastpass app for kindle fire is top notch!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a challenging app, but it's really fun to try and time yourself how fast you can try and beat a level! I recommend it completely!! (:
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was my favorite book, I actually bought not only the kindle version but bought the paperback version for my sister who loved it as well, greatly written and smartly included meaning of flowers throughout the book for advert lovers of flowers like myself, bravo on this book
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This was a gift for my son at Christmas - I bought 4 of these cases as gifts- one was a kindle and others were for ipad - very nice products would highly recommend.
0857685848|3.0|I bought this for my son as a gift. I thought it was hand painted or drawn pictures of dinosaurs and they were comoputer digitized.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love it<br /><br />Omg this is amazing and cute I love the horses... it keeps me busy for hours sweetness of the horses
B00000JPH6|5.0|Again, this was one of my favorite movies as a child, and I am so glad you had it so I could share it with them :)  They love it and I still do too!  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with children :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rebecca Marsh
B0073PZIYI|1.0|Again a movie that wasted my time and money - probably just need to give up on movies they all seem so predictable and in poor taste.
1439177783|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I found her struggle with her eating disorder extremely interesting to read about. I didn't want to put it down.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|I watched this while visiting my son in Seattle. This is an experience, one that cannot really be expressed with words. Watch it.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love Dr Quinn. I have enjoyed watching these DVDs. It would be nice if the description was more informative. Being unfamiliar with this set I was not aware that the movies were included in the complete series. What was even more confusing was that when I ordered this set the movies were suggested as an additional purchase leading me to believe that they were not included.
B008CP93S0|2.0|This movie was predictable from the beginning, crude and just plain bad.  I would never recommend this movie or watch it again.
B009ZE27US|1.0|It's really a waste of money.  It's cute the first two or three times you ise it but everybody was the same ago...even my cat!!!
B00316DDUE|5.0|The sound quality of this concert is amazing; blows your doors off<br />Yanni is incredible; you can see the joy the musicians have playing for him<br />He certaintly brings joy to people's lives by moving them.  Never seen him in concert but love to; this is about as close as you can get
B009CPJHY4|5.0|An all-star cast comes together to provide a good date night movie or just a girl night movie. Husband enjoyed the movie.
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|This movie was a waste of money - dull as dirt - forced myself to watch it thinking it would eventually get better - I was wrong the beginning, middle and end were a waste of money and time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game... yes, it;'s a silly game based on the Ice Age movies but I still enjoy playing it.  It uses real money to get lots of gold and acorns but you can still play the game without getting into buying extra stuff!!  Good for entertainment.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|If you like his 1st album; this is a very good follow up album.  Best songs are &#34;Young Girls&#34;, &#34;Locked Out in Heaven&#34; and &#34;Moonshine&#34;. He certaintly sings with passion.  Need to listen the the album more but so far really like it especially those 3 songs.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|The Dark Knight was exciting and clever film. I hope there's another film in this series with Batman making  another comeback.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry once again shows himself to be the protector of those who can no longer protect themselves. This was a good read that kept my interest.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great case - super durable and protects the phone.  Had a stranger ask me where I got the 'high tech\\" case.  Looks impressive...works well!
B00AAQ7JNA|3.0|Just bought this Blu-ray Concert DVD and have to agree the sound quality on this Blu-ray is not good; kind of messed up.  The concert itself is excellent and she does a great job of the performance and skiing but the sound quality was NOT Blu-ray quality; it sounded like a regular DVD if that.  Alot of people complained about the sound quality and made me hesitate to buy it, but I enjoy her music too much to pass it up.  I knew the sound quality was off when I put in another Blu-ray concert (Yanni) and the sound quality of the Blu-ray was stunning compared to this.<br /><br />I hope Rihanna's managers are reading these reviews and fire the company who made this DVD sound.  Every single other Blu-ray concert DVD I have sounds better than this one.  Buy this if you love Rihanna's music but be warned the sound quality is not like normal Blu-rays
B002BIULQ2|5.0|love her music, love mylie cyrus, good fun movie, the sound track for this movie is wonderful, we bought that too.  she is a great actress and hopefully she will do more
B001P3SA94|5.0|Details the birth of the urban blues in Chicago, and who made it happen. Brody is terrific as the blues impressario, Leonard Chess, and Jeffrey Wright's Muddy is definitive. Mos Def almost out-Chucks the real Chuck Berry, and Beyonce's Etta is strong and credible. To be watched over and over!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Great Episode.....will Reid ever... - actually he was a male model before this gig.  He has that, &#34;Let me save him&#34; quality that women love.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought one for a friend who needed something to enjoy and learn from so many functions. Then I bought one for myself and I am completely satisfied.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|lemonade mouth is a great teen movie, no sex, no violence, and no gun toting mobsters, a family movie.  the plot is good, the music great, and the acting good too.  we bought the movie because we know we will want to watch often.
B000002GZ1|5.0|About as &#34;Black&#34; as a white band can deliver that 60's Chicago blues sound! The Butterfield Band was a heavy influence on those of us coming of musical age in the 60's.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it.  best game ever. i wish I could play it every day because it is the best game
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I've played this game two or three times.  It'll load once or twice and that's it.  I've reinstalled it with the same results. I haven't tried it on my phone, but it doesn't work on my Fire, and I haven't done anything to it besides other apps.  Hopefully someone cares since there are a lot of people who have the same problem.
B002GOAH1U|5.0|we lovd amanda bynes great actress, great fun movie, and of course colin firth is very easy on the eyes, and a terrific actor.
B000BMPQUG|5.0|So what are guys waiting for take that cd, this music feel like your going back in early nineties hits music and singalong with it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I want to beat my highscore so badly. there's is a thing in the game where you get to ride in a train car if you get far enough.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is a great app just when i try to do a save me it crashes and says i have  -1  gem and that is why i gave it 3 stars
B0055SWM08|5.0|Everything from the music to the graphics are top notch. The puzzles are challenging and there is a real feeling of accomplishment getting perfect scores.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Wanted to give it a 5 but did not draw me in the way some previous books have. That said I did enjoy it, was fairly predictable, did pull for David Zinc.  Knew he would come out on top.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I was totally enjoying this game until the ball rolling game. I am playing on a kindle fire and The ball does not follow the angle I tilt to. Once the ball starts rolling it continues to roll in a straight line. The only thing I can control is getting it started. Also my screen flips if I tilt too far so I am totally screwed. cant get past it even tho I skipped it the first go round. So I now have no way to finish the game that I paid for. I don't normally write reviews but this has me so frustrated and upset that I need to say something. I really wish there was a way to get past this but I don't see it happening. I wish I never even started playing this game. I want my money back so that I can buy a game I can actuality play to the end. If you use an orb to skip a puzzle. but you don't get thru the chapter and have to start over you should get that orb back so that you can skip the problem again. UGH! I am a lover of big fish games and have paid for tons of them but this is cheating me and I am discusted at them for this.
1594488843|5.0|WOW!  Wish I could have everyone in management (everywhere) read this book - and then discuss it.  Great, factual information that anyone would benefit from knowing.  I have put information from this book to direct use many times since reading it and have influenced several others to also read this book.  What to know how to motive your workers?  Others in general?  To just understand human nature a bit better?  This book is for you.  I have read many books on why people do what they do, but this is one of the best.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Great songs, and whether you like the Carpenters or not, you have to admit that Karen Carpenter had one of the greatest voices out there.  My husband is a big fan and was really happy to get this collection for Christmas.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so good, I should call it the dream game cause there can only be a game like that in your dream it's so good.
0345803485|1.0|I heard so much hype about this book, i assumed it would at least be some what entertaining....I was wrong! I honestly feel like a teenager wrote this book. It was not even the least bit erotic. I guess it would make an ok script for some cheesy porn movie. What i I truly can not figure out, is why this book is so popular???? I really feel sorry for anyone that thinks this a good read.......
B00454U1NS|5.0|If you like Pink you will love this one.  I got it as a gift for my daughter and while she loves it, I discovered I also love this music.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and having it in Blu-ray is just an added bonus for me!  I was surprised at the improvement from the regular movie to the Blu-ray.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Had to get this after my son fell asleep to the beta test. Definitely a must have app for people with kids!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games. Good book  very exciting!<br />This was a good book , I'm so glad I read it. Wow, wow !
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Just rated the book with this title and thought I was rating the DVD.  While the book is also great, I like the DVD better as it grabs you and almost forces you to realize how the production of our food had changed in the recent past.  If you care about your health or the health of those you love, watch this DVD.  Then loan it out to anyone who will watch it.  Farming today is nothing like it was a generation ago.  If only watching this was part of the high school curriculum (Health Class) . . . I believe more people need to be informed on just how much our food production has changed for corrections to be put in place.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter at Christmas.  It was a good deal for everyone.  I was able to keep one copy here at my house so she can watch it when she is here. She was thrilled to have a blu-ray edition to keep at home.  You know how kids are--they will watch the same movie over and over, and she already has!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Hoping they make a movie out of this whole series.  This was just as good as the first book.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Love it!
B001CDL6ZM|5.0|This is a great album, and the vinyl is just as good. The thing is, it was clearly made for CDs, because the first side of the first record was like loud to the point where it didn't sound good. But the rest of it was awesome
B008J34466|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, and she loves it.  However, I discovered I also love to listen to this CD.  Great purchase.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I'm a Josh Groban listener, and found this song, he sang beautiful, and since this is not on any of his cd's I bought it .<br />I love quiet, soothing music, and am an older lady, so todays music does not interest me as much as his does. It's a generation thing,but was there with the Elvis crowd in my day. I don't think age should be a big difference with this cd, it's just lovely, period.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really love this game... its fun and addictive. i like the kill sushi one the absolute best. I recommend this to everyone.
B005CRQ3RK|2.0|It didn't turn oit the way I expected it to be. I was expecting w more funny book with lots of humor, but this book is a flop.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I mainly got this for my kids who enjoyed playing Temple Run.  They asked me to get it.  The fact that it was FREE was a plus.  Being a sequel, I expected this to be even better.  So far it has disappointed the kids one bit and they want to keep playing it every chance they get.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the choices you have with the White Noise App. I find it to be very soothing. I highly recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|I recently purchased all three books and I am super excited to begin reading them. The product was in great condition and they were delivered before the estimated delivery. I would recommend purchasing them and beginning the adventure. Thank you!
B003PGNBNY|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughters for Christmas. They love it and watch it about once a week it seems.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Watched it twice and relegated it to the back of my movie shelf.  Acting was great, overall tone of the movie left me &#34;wanting&#34;.
B006DHASYM|5.0|This is a great romantic comedy for mature audiences, Lots of fun and great acting performance from Anna Faris.  Chris Evans also does a good job.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Well, after finishing the PoBaW, I kinda just sat there, shocked. It was an incredibly well written book, but with very \\"adult\\" content. In some parts I was a little confused, but only because I wasn't sure what kind of mental problems Charlie had so I couldn't reference that. Charlie's character is a very troubled teen, yet incredibly bright and caring. All in all, I really enjoyed it and it will keep me thinking about it for a long time.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great book, but ending was certainly lacking. Author chooses to mention a lack of closure between characters, yet in my opinion failed to properly conclude his novel.  This being said, this was still an expertly written piece.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer- another John Grisham novel is a intricately spun tale that will keep you guessing until the very end.  In my opinion, John Grisham has never written a ho-hom novel -- he is brilliant!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is a metaphor for the present and upcoming state of the US.  That is why this series attracts conservatives and those prepared for social collapse.  Zombies are simply those that did not believe it could happen here.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|a great movie and great edition to the other resident evil movies. there are only two resident evil movies(animation) in the serise.<br />this is one of the best movies you would want to buy if you after the whole serise of resident evil movies.
B001JIFYSA|1.0|The movie was disappointly shallow and frivolous, much more about lust and infatuation than any kind of genuine love. Too many characters.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|godd app.  Use every day to keep track of what my boyfriend is buying while I am at work!!!  lol
0345803507|5.0|I freaking love this book & it came in great conditions... I think every man & woman who wants to spices things up in the bedroom should read it....
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|We don't really allow our 1 year old to watch much TV/Movies, but on occasion it helps her wind down and this is one that she'll sit and watch. She loves the music and bright colors. It's got a great a message, and my husband and I find more and more funny little moments in the movie each time we watch it. And it looks amazing on Blu-ray.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just like his other books, I can visualize this book as a movie. Very descriptive and a great read. Really hard to put down.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|pudding monsters is cool and fun with a little bit of challenge and fun and pudding and monseers  mustasthch .......,,d,,.,,bfb
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a surreal tale, combined with the reuniting of a father and a son.  If this movie doesn't make you shed a tear, then you don't have a heart.  Wonderful, but then again Tim Burton is a genius
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My little girl was so excited to get this movie.  She had been asking for it and I found it on this site.  It was shipped out super fast and for a reasonable price.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this little bit of murder mystery.  Just wish it was more ghostly.  I am a huge fan of hidden object games and spooky things and for the most part this fit the bill.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have loved horses ever since I was a little girl! I have always wanted a horse to have in my backyard. But my parents always said no! Now that there is the game My Horse I can take care of a horse as if it were mine in real life! I highly suggest this app/game! :)

The only down side to this sharpening tool is the writing on the side to indicate which is the Carbide Sharpening bits and the Ceramic ones, it's hard to see.<br />Many who often use and work with knives are always complaining about how difficult it is to keep them sharp, with this handy Sharpening tool the problem is solved.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the best app on the whole amazon app store. It would be even more cool if they made a number three where you are the monkey getting chased by a mob of temple run characters.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|It's a great show. It can be a little kitschy at times, but that's a part of the genre. It can also be pretty gory, but again its part of the package. I like this season in a different way than I liked the first season, but they both have their strengths and weaknesses.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow this is way better than the first addition! Its more interesting because there's way more af a challenge which makes you want to keep playing!

Great cast, great story line, and GREAT music! WTG! I will be putting this on my \\"TO BUY LIST!\\"
B0091REZMW|4.0|The graphics great, and sequence of play outstanding but the unfortunate thing is to advance prior to the initial gift of diamonds everything costs including eating  it would be perfect to have an app without high fees Watch out when you change to a second kindle you lose All the money you invested in diamonds and coins.

030758836X|4.0|I find the one-star reviews--that trash GONE GIRL as 'unreadable' or 'poorly written'--to be incomprehensible.  I certainly don't commiserate with these views, and, what's more--employing simple objective analyses (i.e. is the grammar correct? is the writing descriptive? are the characters fleshed out?)--I concede no ground whatsoever that this is a one-star book.  As purely a body of text with words properly strung together, it's undeserving of that; as a thoroughly entertaining novel, it's undeserving of that.<br /><br />It's more than a robust thriller wrapped in entertaining prose and narrative wit.  The characters are three-dimensional, made of flesh and blood and riddled with flaws.  Gillian Flynn's skill is with writing characters that slip and slide and challenge our loyalties.  We sympathize with, admire, and even see ourselves in Nick and Amy at various points throughout the book; but we begin to lose our belief in them as worthwhile people, favor one over the other, and then regain or further diminish our loyalties as we learn more.  We establish respect for Nick's resilience, and even some admiration for Amy's; and we are overcome with loathing.<br /><br />Labeling GONE GIRL an 'easy read' sounds a bit unfair on the surface, but I mean it well.  It's a book we regret putting down; it effortlessly involves us in the strange, and increasingly stranger, circumstances of its protagonists--blurring the line between pro- and antagonist a dozen or so times along the way.<br /><br />Measuring this book against literature in the same genre does nothing, in my opinion, but confirm its strengths.<br /><br />It is foremost an entertainment, an escape.  It is secondarily a strong and original story--though occasionally, blissfully, absurd, and sometimes too familiar, but on purpose.  It's an even stronger character drama.  The rhythm of the suspense and the tenor of the twists are deeply satisfying (if these motifs are of little merit to you, perhaps look elsewhere).<br /><br />The third act is rightfully the most criticized part of the novel.  Some believe it cuts off too abruptly; some believe it attempts too much and suffers under its weight.  I'm in the latter camp as I prefer ambiguity where possible; I'm more taken with an explosion than I am with its explanation. I would have been more satisfied with a less labored conclusion; a, paradoxically, less-messy ending with more loose ends--fewer halfhearted answers and more threatening questions.<br /><br />The book is a great read; not without flaw and not without success.  I strongly recommend it.

B004V6BQ3O|4.0|I own a Nikon D800E, and while I shoot mostly stills, I purchased the ME-1 for those occasions where I want to use my camera for video.<br /><br />Out of the box, the D800 can capture borderline acceptable sound with its built-in microphone. On a calm day with not much background noise, you'll be able to capture conversations at a reasonable distance using the built-in microphone. But add some background noise, wind noise or lots of motion (causing the camera to focus), and the built-in mic is less than ideal. You end up with world-class video, and iPhone-like audio.<br /><br />One simple solution is the Nikon ME-1. It mounts in the hotshoe and provides generally much better audio quality than the camera's built-in microphone. It comes with a windscreen to help keep wind noise out, and it sits generally higher off the camera, making it more immune to picking up the sound of the lens motors as you zoom or focus.  The cable is even long enough that you can put it on a hotshoe extender (not included) and get it maybe 6-8&#34; away from the camera.<br /><br />The ME-1 is unobtrusive, being not much bigger than a man's thumb. It doesn't substantially change the balance or feel of your camera, and it doesn't get in the way. It records two-channel stereo, but of course, being so small, there isn't a huge sense of stereo separation in the resulting audio channels.<br /><br />The ME-1 comes with the windscreen, cable and a case and one of the things I like is that it requires no batteries. Controcution is typical Nikon - that is, very good. Although it's obviously designed for Nikon cameras, the ME-1 should work on any brand having a 3.5mm audio input jack and a hotshoe. I've tried it on a Canon camcorder, for example, and it works well in that sort of configuration too.<br /><br />The ME-1 includes a built-in low-cut filter to cut out the low frequency boom you often get in windy conditions. With the microphone mounted above the camera, it can be much more susceptible to wind noise, and so you'll probably find yourself using the windscreen more than you might think. There are a few third-party windsock products that fit the ME-1...sounds like a good idea, but the few I've tried - while effective in reducing wind noise - tend to muffle the sound a bit.<br /><br />As for sound quality, in most cases, the ME-1 is a definite improvement over the camera's built-in mic - but not a tremendous one. While DSLRs can put out amazing video, the audio isn't in the same league - even with the ME-1. Nikon rates the frequency response as 70-16000 with only a 60DB signal to noise ratio. While this is adequate for human speech and so forth, it's not going to give you terrific results recording, say, a live orchestra. The good news is that I suppose you can use high-end microphones off-camera for critical recordings - just don't expect the ME-1 alone to give you that.<br /><br />If you're happy with your DSLR's video, but want to push the sound quality ahead, the ME-1 is worth a try.

1451662432|5.0|I expected this book to be an extension of the author's incredible ego and massive self-love. And, to some degree, it is. But that aside, I found it to be perhaps the most honest and thorough biography I've read. I won't write a long review as there are over a hundred here as I write this. But suffice it to say that Arnold has written a book that is truly \\"Total Recall\\" in that he has not missed anything except perhaps for the multitude of his infidelities with women to whom he was not married. He stops short of delving into his groping and general vulgar, unappealing treatment of women.<br /><br />But the book is a great read for people interested in business and being successful in business. And it really does take the reader through Arnold's life in vivid detail. I found it hard to put down. On a personal level, I have no respect for the author. As a business person, I have a good deal of respect for him.<br /><br />I found one area where he contradicted himself. He said he didn't marry Maria because of who she was or what she had or what she brought to the table. Toward the end of the book, however, he inserted among his accomplishments, \\"I married a Kennedy.\\" Early in the book he says she was not one of his trophies but that sentence toward the end seems to sadly contradict that.<br /><br />Biographies, by their nature, tend to make the author sound far grander than he is. The author leaves out his weaknesses and increases his strengths. Arnold doesn't do this. He's basically very honest in the book At least that's what I felt as I read it. I only found one or two areas where he may have not told the truth but later it somehow comes out --- as in the above example.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-- Susanna K. Hutcheson, copywriter<br />powerwriting.com

B00785P2QC|5.0|A really fun game. Really simple and easy to catch on to. Glad that it was free as well. 5 stars over all
B007L6VR12|3.0|I'm not a Wes Anderson fan, but I don't especially dislike him. The only other of his movies I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums, and I didn't much like it but don't much remember it either. So I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.<br /><br />It's quirky and sort of dark, which I like, and it has a consistent tone of unreality all the way through, which I also like. I'd gotten the idea that the Wilson brothers (Owen, et al) are closely bound up with Anderson, so I was relieved not to see any of them here because I can't stand any of them.<br /><br />But I didn't mind some actors whom I usually can't stand (Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray), I liked one I always like (Frances McDormand), and I was indifferent to the rest, to whom I'm generally indifferent (Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, etc). The kids were okay but nothing exceptional.<br /><br />I don't see what in this movie freaked out the people who were freaked out by it, unless it was the sex play between the kids; but heterosexual sex always disgusts me so this was no different. Overall, a movie I enjoyed more than I expected to but probably won't ever watch again.
B0083F5J7S|5.0|If you love Maroon 5, you will love this CD.  I have them all, and they just keep getting better and better!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I love this book because it was honest... even in times when most people would have spun a situation around to show themselves in a different light, a better light, he didn't. Whether it was good, bad, disgusting, and horrible at times, I loved it because it was real.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story held my interest but the female character was a little hard for me to believe . Altogether TMI on the sex.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I can study without having all my school books! I always have my Kindle Fire with me so it's very convenient.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I am a true Maroon 5 fan, and cannot get enough of this CD.  I play it over and over again.  If you're a fan, you'll love it too.!
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I am not reviewing the film but the disc itself<br /><br />This is one of the worst transfers to DVD I have ever seen or a recent film<br /><br />It looks like the took a VHS that was recorded on a UHF channel and burned it to disc<br /><br />Oh but it has been restored for this special anniversary addition in “HD” - no that was the sound - not the picture.<br /><br />Well it was only $5 and I needed it for some kids that are doing the play in school – but you would think it would at least be in widescreen now that everyone seems to finally have 16x9 TVs – it is not even full frame but pan and scan
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A cute story with a happy ending.  The murderer sure was very gullible!!! I think the story could have been a little more intense.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|truly loved this movie  have been waiting to get it on dvd and finally have  thank you so very much
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never read a story from the point of view of a person with cancer. I never knew the thought process. This book makes me appreciate my life even more. Everyone should read this book.
1599218011|5.0|I borrowed this from the library, but had to purchase my own copy because I continually go back to it to learn about the most current information for nutrition and overall healthy lifestyle. I love Kris's positive, encouraging attitude. And, really, this book is just chock full of great information. The enormous section on supplements helped me figure out where to get started. I went to see a really great nutritionist in my area armed with lots of knowledge from this book. This book made me feel as though I had another person on my team as I figure out how to heal and how to work with an integrative medicine system after years of going the traditional route. Kris Carr's writing makes me feel more confident that there are others out there who are marrying holistic with traditional in order to find the right balance in their healing process. If you're not feeling great, you really have to be your own advocate and team captain but you don't have to do it alone. I've since enlisted many others to join my team and I love to read and follow Kris Carr because she really has the knack for gathering some of the best doctors and holistic leaders.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love to play all of the different types of songs. Especially the Harry Potter theme song from the cloud player
B004GF244K|5.0|This is simply amazing. Eric Clapton playing While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this video.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is definitely the best battery app I have ever used. It's always correct and it gives you accurate time left estimates for different kindle activities like apps and reading and watching movies as well as battery capacity charts.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|You absolutely can't go wrong with anything by Joe Bonamassa!  Then throw in a visit by Eric Clapton and it's more than you can ask for!<br /><br />See one of his live shows, he's amazing!  I recommend most of Joe's CDs; I own at least 6 of them.  My favorites are You & Me, The Ballad of John Henry and Blues Deluxe, but there really isn't a bad one in the lot.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like fruit ninja. It is a good game to play when you are trying to pads time and its entertainment.
0783230079|5.0|The entire cast, especially Robert Downey, Jr. is fantastic.  The characters, the plot, the writing is superb. I wish everyone would buy this video. GREAT!!!!!
B0058YPILY|5.0|It arrived quickly and was well priced.  I added it to my collection. I have over 1600 DVDs and I look for cost effectiveness and quality.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I so enjoy period pieces such as Downton Abbey and this is truly a quality production.  The acting is very good and it is easy to get swept up into the lives of all of the characters.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I don't really like this app because you have to get people to join kin before you could text them.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it.It  was awesome and made you ise your brain.the graphics were cool too.it was a good game overall
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like the app on my kindle fire. It's convenient, but I often use the web browser so I can more easily find new stories.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I don't know how Rodriguez managed to get overlooked in the '60's & '70's in the US!  He was a major hit in South Africa and Australia and I really hope he will now get his due here in the States.<br /><br />The best way to describe him is &#34;Dylan-esque&#34;, so if you are a Bob Dylan fan, you will likely enjoy this CD as well.<br /><br />I don't think there is a single song on the CD that I don't like...give it a try!!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I love to play this game. It is SO fun to find out how many different things that there is to make starting with just fire,water,earth, earth,and wind.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think  that this game is so awesome.It is really fun.I just love the challenge. I have to work really hard to finish the harder levels.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Awesome picture. And price was great, too. My kids (2 and 6) will actually sit still and watch this with me. I highly recommend this if you like nature.
1439102813|4.0|I enjoyed the book but also found it disturbing because I'm at that age where holding my own memory together is a daily struggle.  The book made me wonder if maybe I am also heading toward Alzheimer's.<br /><br />The book does reference some resources for patients and family, which was nice.
0230749372|5.0|I'm already looking forward to the remaining books in the trilogy.  Ken Follett tells a great story.  This is an interesting period of time and the characters are compelling.
B007HACDLK|1.0|Martin f.Malkin: \\"I truly hope their are no persona as portrayed in this book. Conservative rabble-rousing to the point of disbelief. Even if the story was good, the characters are all 1-dimensional. I gave up after 50 pages.\\"<br /><br />Completely accurate description of the book. Initially I relegated my discomfort as sensitivity to American cultural quirks (as I am not American). So I chugged along ignoring inflammatory sentences.  However, after more chapters, my doubts were chocked out by the ethnocentrism that pervaded the book.  I came looking for a good thriller and was lambasted by an ideology that is simply ignorant and inexcusable in today's globalized world. I would simply like to ask Flynn to travel, meet and talk to people of other nations so that he can understand their choices and motivations instead of coughing out this shallow simplified write-up which is akin to poison for the mind.
0525952926|3.0|I'm not going to re-tell the story - if you are reading this, you surely know basically what this book is about. Ken Follett tells a great story. He knows how to put a plot together and keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />But I have two gripes: First, very very little effort went into the dialogue. All of the characters speak in the same, stilted manner, like \\"Civilizations rise and fall, but no one really knows why.\\" All the characters talk that way, all the time!<br /><br />Second, all the romances (and there are many) have the exact same dynamic: Virtuous but idiosyncratic guy falls for gorgeous, strong girl, who originally rejects him thinking that he is like all the other jerks, but who eventually realizes how great he is, and immediately jumps in the sack with him.<br /><br />Both in the dialogue and the relationships, a little imagination would have done what Ken Follett did not, which was to turn this excellent story into an excellent book.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Loved this book.  Even though it is quite large, the subject matter makes it a very fast read.<br /><br />It is not a typical Stephen King horror story.  It is also not a typical time traveling story - I found it much easier to follow than the Time Traveler's Wife and some others that I've read.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who has every thought that maybe things could have been better in their life or the world could have been better...if only something had gone differently.  You may be wrong.
0321811984|5.0|Garr Reynolds's \\"Presentation Zen\\" will help seasoned presentation veterans who look for inspiration to break from their routine delivery modus operandi, and it will be invaluable to newcomers who seek a step-by-step process for creating brilliant visuals and timeless lectures.<br /><br />Highly educated scientists, engineers, doctors, and systems analysts often struggle with keeping their ideas simple. This shortcoming is understandable because subject-matter experts in these professions tend to be process-oriented rather than results-oriented. In effect, their science inundates the audience with information overload.<br /><br />Reynolds suggests many techniques to reinvent such presentations with a more audience-focused, memorable approach. For the theorist, he thoughtfully summarizes his rationale for recasting presentations; for the technician, he vividly illustrates practical tips.<br /><br />I have used this book in my presentation skills teaching with good results. Most of my students, who are educated, experienced, and sophisticated managers and analysts, appreciate the focus, simplicity, and relevance of \\"Presentation Zen.\\"
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I really enjoyed this tale of Ivan's, we finally were shown how smart and brave he is. In all the stories he's been in Miles shadow. We always New he was a patriot and do anything for Miles.The Count, and Gregar; but this shows what type of man he has become and not one that just wants to pull a joke on MILES (as in Winterfair). I liked the way she brought By into the book. She has turned two supporting character's into two hero's.  I can recommend this book as a must read for anyone who has enjoyed the Vorkosigan Saga.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought this book was extremely well written.  After this read I have even more respect for these men and women who risk their lives for us every day.  I only wish we could replace the present administration with these heros instead of the crackpots in there now!
0060936223|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have never been a huge Patti Smith fan, but the book was recommended by a friend so I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed both the writing style and hearing about so many other artists that Patti encountered over the years.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My son happens to love this series which is why we are still reading it.  It is an interesting story line...but theologically speaking, differs from our family's beliefs.  I have to stop and tell my son that I don't agree with parts of the book and we talk about how our beliefs differ.  It has Greek names which are hard for kids to read and also some difficult words to read in general- some of which I have to say &#34;son, I don't even know what that word even means!&#34;  Kids seem to love it; I just think it is ok.
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|Palpability between actor and character is what makes the ride fun and worth taking, but that just isn't there with Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. It was a boring storyline too with the first fifteen minutes being the best part of the film. I'd wait until On-Demand or DVD to give it a look.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You get to draw and chat with the kids that why I think you should get it I love this game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three has brought a maturity to the writing and development of the characters which was not seen in the first two seasons.  Matthew is still a bore, but everyone else continues to develop as time trudges on.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|2hrs of my life gone -5 stars. Movies of today just suck big time, don't rent it and waste your money
B0094FTKIA|4.0|Despite what many other reviewers have said,  this movie has a lot of depth to it.  The eye candy is amazing, yes, but the storyline does carry u through. The point of Mike's and Joanna's relationship was to show how Mike really was looking to get into a more serious relationship despite outward appearances. Yes, he's a stripped, but he's more than that, and he's working hard to get out of that lifestyle. I think the point of Kid's character was to show what happens to ppl in that kind of lifestyle when the have no real sense of direction or purpose. I think this movie is totally worth watching and sorely under appreciated.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It works perfectly on my kindle HD. The display is wonderful and game play is great. All in all an awesome game. :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun if you're bored. horse looks very realistic and even has good sound effects. I like turtles. green turtles with shells.

B005IEGUDY|5.0|Great story. It's the second time I've read it and it was just as<br />Good as the first time. It's worth the time.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|I've always enjoyed reading Mitch Albom's books and this one was no different.<br />In the Time Keeper he makes you laugh, cry, and think.<br />His writings put you in the moment and this book does the same.<br />It's a fast read, I couldn't put it down.<br />If you like Mitch Albom, Time Keeper is sure to please!<br />Excellent!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect being that MI movies have been a hit or miss for me in the past, but really liked it. Definitely worth the buy.
B000WFBC6E|1.0|The clock arrived with the second hand detached.  It appears from other reviews that this is not the first time this has happened.  The clock looks cool but it does not operate like a Swiss Railway clock with the pause at the 12 o'clock position and the minute hand then following.  The license fees for the clock face must have been pricey because the mechanism is nothing short of cheap for a wall clock with this high a price.  The value for price paid on this is very poor.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but today it just restart and I just got Tony so now I'm really mad. it really bothers me.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is amazing.Its perfect soup for the horse lovers soul! :) I like this game due to the fact that it includes horses. but what bugs me alot though are the ads. it would be better without them.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funnier then I was expecting!! AWESOME MUSIC!!!! WOW!! Definitely worth watching!! Good one liners, lighthearted comedy. Very, very talented singers!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the Wool omnibus. I enjoyed the world and characters created by Howey. I did find the pacing a bit slow at times; however, I had enough interest in the characters and story arc that I had no trouble reading through. (The first long trek from the top of the silo to the bottom, for instance, is rather detailed and drawn out. However, Howey is painstakingly describing this foreign world and its social order.) I thought the main protagonists were all very compelling. I enjoyed his main villain, as well. As the story develops, you can somehow imagine how he justifies what he does (i.e., his of idea of the greater good). IMHO, the scariest form of evil isn't black and white.<br /><br />I wish a little more of the back story had been revealed. We know where they are and generally what happened, but I was left hungry for more details. From what I understand, Howey has developed a prequel that may cover it. That said, I think I've been in the claustrophobic confines of the silo for too long and won't be ready to return for quite a while. When the story ended, I personally wasn't aching for it to go on. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. To me, the sign of a truly great story is that you're either left hungry for more or continue to think about the story long after reading.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell, especially the Scarpetta series. Reading this was almost like being their.As always lots of intrique and suspense, just what I expect in a good mystery. Can't wait for the next one!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|If you're looking for something a little different in your fantasy reading, Patrick Rothfuss's &#34;The Name of the Wing&#34; may just be what you're looking for.  It has all the trappings of your usual fantasy novels with a touch of science fiction flare that he uses to help explain how &#34;magic&#34; works.  You'll also find the protagonist a bit of challenging personality as while you want to root for him, his choices seem to go against common sense.  Have fun with it and enjoy many hours of enjoyable reading.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love this version, Of course it's too scary for little kids but it's so cool! Not very often you get a scary Christmas movie classic! I hate scary movies but since this one ends so well, I dunno, it doesn't bug me. My mother-in-law however was not impressed... heh heh...

B001706I5I|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Christmas movie! The best in my book. The movie itself is okay... I mean the blu ray looks like someone made it... I don't think it's the actual Blu Ray movie and the dvd in the case was in an envelope? A little weird. I think a computer geek put this together and sold it. Not the original blu ray. But the movie does look great! Watched it every day for a good 2 weeks! =)
B000I55YU8|5.0|This has to be one of Michael Douglas' best movies of all time but then I'm a Michael Douglas fan. Good Action, Good Story and Great Star Cast-one of the best!!!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This story was a very well written story. It made me laugh and it made me cry.... a lot. This is the kind of story that stays with you for a while and makes you think. You want other people to read it so  you can talk about it to someone.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is such a good game! it is addicting, more challenging than the first but better graphics and it has better view of the goals and easier to get there.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The film is breathtaking and the performances are brilliant.  David Lean (&#34;Bride on the River Kwai&#34;, &#34;Dr. Zhivago&#34;) directs from a script by Robert Bolt (&#34;A Man for All Seasons&#34;)  As with any historical film, one can quibble with the accuracy of this or that, but T.E. Lawrence was already being mythologized in his own lifetime, so any portrayal is bound to be controversial. Lowell Thomas's reporting and lecture tour made Lawrence and international celebrity while he was still in the field fighting the Turks, and his own autobiographical writings both added to the legend and deepened the mystery, of this contradictory, brilliant and maddening figure.<br /><br />The Blu Ray disc looks and sounds gorgeous and the extras are very nice.  The only thing I could wish for that is not here is a commentary from Lean himself, but that was not to be.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I thought it was beautifully written innocent love story. Thoroughly enjoyed the characters the author created, I can't wait to read more of her books.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|FBI agent Olivia Dunham's world is turned upside down when she and her partner are assigned to an interagency taskforce led by Homeland Security.  A plane filled with dead people has lands at Boston's Logan airport, her partner is exposed to mysterious chemicals that are slowly killing him (and turning his flesh and tissue transparent) and the only man who can save him and solve the mystery of the plane is a brilliant scientist, Dr. Walter Bishop.  Bishop's name was once spoken of in the same breath as Einstein's and Fermi's, but when his lab assistant was killed in a fire, he was committed to a mental hospital for the criminally insane - where he has remained for the last 17 years. The only way Dunham can get Bishop's help to solve her case and save her partner is to enlist the aid of Bishop's estranged son Peter, a drifter, con man, sometime military contractor and all-around shady character, who she finds in Iraq where he is about to swindle some guys in an oil pipeline deal.<br /><br />And that all happens in the first 30 minutes or so of the 2 hour pilot.  &#34;Fringe&#34; is an amazingly ambitious show - part police procedural, part SF adventure, part philosophy seminar.  It has been called &#34;The X-Files meets Lost&#34;, but I think it is better than either of those shows.  In many ways &#34;Fringe&#34; is the show that &#34;X-Files&#34; wanted to be, before it lost the handle on its own mythology.  That very ambition, and the need to lay out an extensive backstory for both the characters and the universe they inhabit, causes the series to get off the a slightly uneven start, but all of the episodes are good, and by episode 4 the show really finds it voice.  I just watched the series finale last Friday, and have been rewatching the show on disc since, and I'm happy to say that it all hangs together wonderfully, and that there are things in even the earliest episodes that pay off at the end.  (The second aired episode touches on a theme that will be important throughout the entire series, but that isn't clear until midway through season 2.)  The first season is a great launch to what turned out to be a terrific series.  It is largely made up of standalone episodes, but the mythology is clearly there and building, and almost ever episode has some event, character or subject that advances or comments on the over-arcing story of the season and the series.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to use, very simple and not unlike using it on a personal computer.  Graphics wonderful and photos very good.  Had one instance of a video freezing up but this may have been my Kindle and not the program.  Use it all the time!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love the levels. Uses some thinking process after the first theme levels and can get tricky at times but it's great!!
B0096HFOZO|4.0|Nothing sweet here.  Some might consider it a little edgy.  There is a lot of concentration on despising the twits, and their relationship is a model of dysfunction.  Edifying only as reverse psychology, but quite entertaining.  I'm encouraged to try other Roald Dahl books.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Generally, the 3rd in a series falls flat.  That was not the case here.  While not quite to the level of the original, this installment did hold it's own.  Josh Brolin did a great job as K, and the story was entertaining, if a bit on the predictable side.  There were a few surprises, but also a few places where you are almost reciting the script before the characters are.  Overall it is an evening well spent, but I am glad I didn't spend the price to see it at the theater.
B001XV1X6A|5.0|This is a great movie. Very entertaining if you are a 9 year old boy.  If you are a 6 year old scaredy cat girl, it would only get 3 1/2 stars. Too many scarey parts
0525478817|5.0|John Green is simply amazing, great story, at one point I already knew what was going to happen but it's still a treat to read. There's so many quotes I can take from this book and reflect on/use in my daily life.
B005HSL626|3.0|Not much variation here, although the idea of whacking fruit to pieces while not hitting a grenade is amusing for a bit.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, but I especially love using it on the Kindle. Everything works smoothly and I haven't seen any glitchiness at all. I love it and highly recommend it.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Good story, son loves the robot action. Good for whole family. I would prefer to give it a 4.5 rating.

B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I liked it, it was just like it said and came very quickly. I would get anything from this buyer. I loved watching this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive. It was easier than temple run. Oddly it was easy to get the high score.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|the tiles are a good size and the sounds are pleasing to listen to.  good app to enjoy while you play.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The writing was fantastic.The author truly developed the characters in a gradual progression that I enjoyed.  I strongly recommend to anyone who appreciates the book The Help.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this show after the 1st 2 seasons.  I absolutely am hooked on it.  Can't wait for Sunday nights.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|\\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is an ugly awaiting her surgery that will transform her into a pretty and send her on her way to New Pretty Town.  All of her friends have already turned pretty, but since her birthday is in September, she is the last one waiting in Ugly Town.  While turning a trick one night(not the kind of tricking you are thinking) she meets Shay, who believes there is something more to life than being pretty and partying all day and night.  Tally has never heard of someone reluctant to be turned pretty.  When Shay runs away to the far off land she has been mentioning, Tally is worried.  But then the authorities give her a choice - find Shay, or never turn Pretty.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It certainly isn't my favorite in the world of dystopian books, but it did hold my attention from the beginning.  It is a very interesting premise that everyone must be pretty to avoid conflicts.  In a perfect world, this would simply make people equal, which would eradicate jealousy and judging someone from their looks.  But it's not quite as simple as it all seems.  I can't say much more without giving away spoilers, and I don't usually like spoilers in reviews.  For me, there are two major morals to this story: 1) Looks are not nearly as important as we make them out to be, that your imperfections can make you beautiful, and having surgery to make you look more like someone else is not the answer. 2) Forcing someone to do something just because it is the right thing to do makes you no better than someone with bad intentions forcing someone to do something so that they fit into their idea of the world.  I hope that makes sense.  I don't know how else to word that.<br /><br />The one thing that did bother me is the secret that Tally holds on to the whole book.  I was constantly holding my breath to see if she was going to let it out, or if the other characters would find out some other way.  If she had told the secret earlier, I may have given it 5 stars.  But the fact that she kept it made me look at her a little differently.  I was nervous, knowing that the secret would ruin her and I was anticipating this the whole time, not able to really focus on the relationships she was building with other characters.<br /><br />This book definitely has a cliff hanger ending that makes me want to immediately start the next book to see what happens.  Some people appreciate these endings, some don't.  As long as the next book is already released by the time I am reading it, I am fine with them.  That is why I wait until a whole series is finished to start reading them.  Now, onto the next book: [[ASIN:0439891612 Pretties]]!<br /><br />(I encourage you to comment and vote on my reviews on whether or not the are helpful.  I welcome constructive criticism.  I am trying to improve my reviews so I can start a book blog.  Thanks!)d the secret earlier, I may have given it 5 stars.  But the fact that she kept it made me look at her a little differently.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is cool . finnaly there is a good horse game that isn't stupid! the graphics are pretty good! I am defenitly going to recommend this to all my friends!
0385336950|4.0|To be honest, I started reading this book thinking it was the Other Cloud Atlas. That being said, I found the story & subject matter interesting and well done. The Alaskan WWII theater and the Japanese fire balloons make for an esoteric backdrop for an unusual romance and tragedy. Enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was full of lessons and surprises.It was addictive. A wonderful journey into the character's lives. I was sorry to have reached the end.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I bought this CD to recall the past and one of the CD's has all the songs I remember.  The other has songs I won't play.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I love this game. Plenty of ways to earn game dollars. I enjoy the air game. I haven 't used real dollars yet but I may soon.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Looper was not bad, but it was certainly not good. The plot was not what the trailer implies, and in the end, everything seemed meaningless.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy seeing all the wonderful pins and learning so many new things from new papercraft techniques to places that would be fun to visit.
1451695195|2.0|I bought the kindle edition of this book for myself a couple of weeks ago and then gave a hard copy to my son for his birthday Friday. I had just started reading it when I purchased one for my 34 year old son. I liked the beginning. But....I have not finished it yet because it is boring in a lot of places. It drags in many spots....I guess so there would be more pages in the book. : ) I am about 3/4 of the way through now and will finish it as soon as I write this.<br /><br />I have just gone to the author's website  which is advertised with the book. Yuk.<br /><br />I am saddened to find that it seems to be all about money to Eben..sign up for his e-mails, speaking engagements ....and even (get ready for it...) meditation tapes. That has just ruined it for me. This guy is supposedly using this experience (originally) to tell the world about the afterlife. Cool. I like it. I believe. (I've been reading about this for 20 years, Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Moody, and the docs who wrote all about the kids' NDEs and their last moments.(I have been a hospice volunteer for 8 years). Now I Googled his name and found that he was on TV promoting his book and is using all other sources to make money because of it. Yuk.<br /><br />I'm disgusted. I wonder if he  believes that the \\"angels\\" and \\"God\\" who met with him there (in Heaven)and gave him the \\"love\\" messages are proud of him for cashing in on it. Good Grief. As a 25 year veteran of medicine, I would think that he was already financially set for life. Oh, well. Never underestimate the power of the buck. I checked out the speaking engagement when he is coming to St. Louis in June. It is $375 but that includes all the other speakers too. Just seems steep. I would have thought that he would have come out of the experience more loving and mellow instead of business minded. Just my opinion.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie made me laugh out loud.It was worth  the price.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are a great combo.Josh Brolin nailed a young Agent K.Without giving anything away....it was fantastic!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Physics are defied, the plot is new, but the action is good, and the visuals are great. It is not a re-make, if you will, of the earlier Total Recall.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love it! So funny! It was really awesome and worth it to have the blu-ray and digital copy. I was able to give the DVD to a friend that wanted the movie. Pretty sweet deal!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I'm not sure why there are bad reviews about this album. In my opinion, it's the best Maiden album since Fear Of The Dark, and way better than the 2 albums after it too! This album has all the elements that I look for in a Maiden album: Great riffs, great harmony riffs, catchy melodies, and great vocals. What more could you want, and why complain about this album? This is a huge improvement over Brave New World. The songs are more in your face and original. Being a Maiden fan, I'm not one for them doing just plain heavy songs. The great melody riffs are what I like, and what they're known for. There are great melody riffs in \\"Rainmaker\\", \\"No More Lies\\", \\"Montsegur\\", \\"Dance Of Death\\", and \\"Paschendale\\", and there are great vocal melodies in all of those songs, plus \\"New Frontier\\". \\"Wildest Dreams\\" is really the only song that I'm not really into on this album. It really sounds like they breathed new life into themselves for this one.
B003YUSBRW|5.0|I'm a fan on sneakers. I wear them everyday, at least 16h a day.<br />But, a year ago, I've broken my foot, and was forced to quit sneakers for a while. So, I began wearing Crocs almost everyday. I do realize that, despite all the superb comfort, they are not exactly pretty.<br />So, after a while (my foot is fine, thanks) I found those on Amazon. They are, of course, not as comfortable as as regular Crocs, but, honestly, these are awesome on feet. The insoles are just like a regular Crocs, with the same lovely texture. Also, they really look good while you wear.<br />The only minor downside I found about them is that, living in Brazil, and with a hot climate, the rubber insoles may get a little wet after some time of use, since there is no air intakes like regular Crocs.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Its fun nostalgia.  I don't need to buy the full version because playing one level on a touch screen is all I ever want to do.  Its fun in the docs office just before they hand you 30 sheets of checkboxes about privacy.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I originally got this book at a library I didn't finish it so I got it on my kindle fire. I loved this book it was so interesting and entertaining! I had different emotions throughout the story. Chris Colfer I think that he's an awesome writer and that everyone should read his book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
B000063DIH|4.0|I would say this album deserves 5 stars, but I think \\"The Apparition\\" and \\"Weekend Warrior\\" are worthless songs. \\"Fear Is The Key\\" isn't something I'm into either. Still, there are great songs on this album, like \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Judas Be My Guide\\", \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\", and \\"Fear Of The Dark\\". \\"Wasting Love\\" is very good too. \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"Chains Of Misery\\" and \\"From Here To Eternity\\" are good songs, but not great. I think that this album is a lot better than No Prayer For The Dying, and the best album they released until Dance Of Death.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I start the game up then when I exit and go back into it, it crashes and needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to work again. but it deleted all my settings and coins earned. I am not going to play it again until a fix update is released.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|You know, I love comedy and old slapstick, even Billy Madisonesque movies.  This went way to far.  The raunch took away from some very well written comedy, brief comedy.
B000O59A2K|5.0|I am a big John Wayne fan and when I saw this 2 DVD set, I bought it. These are 2 great movies and at the price I paid for them, it was a no brainer. Anyone who is a John Wayne fan should order this set today.
B008HK3QII|3.0|I did not purchase this case for me.  Rather this was a gift...cannot give an accurate rating for that reason.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, good follow up to hunger games.....a must read if you like the hunger games set.....can't wait to read the next book
B009YU62H2|2.0|I know we all get old, but this album sure hurries along the process.  I struggled to listen to the whole thing.  This is being written from someone who can play badmotorfinger 24-7.  Sadly I now what Soundgarden was trying to do, they were trying to not appear dated and uncool, they succeeded in being irrelevant. I hoped for more, but really got what I expected.  Borrow it from a friend, cry yourself to sleep if you like it(because that's just weird) and give it back.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|The music makes the movie so much more romantic!! Beautiful score for total relaxation. I think it would be great to listen to on your next denist or Dr. visit!
B000024TFY|5.0|After enjoying my much-played vinyl copy of Sad Wings Of Destiny, I looked for the CD version. Not knowing the difference, I bought the Koch release. I noticed that Sad Wings was not included in the remaster series, which started with Sin After Sin. That should've been a clue, but I got the Koch CD. The sound quality was unlistenable! I have an excellent stereo system, 2-channel only, and no matter what bass adjustments I tried, the bass was so over-pronounced I couldn't stand to listen to this recording for even a minute. Whether on my car stereo or my home system, it sounded like crap. I read a very helpful review that said the German Repertoire release of Sad Wings was the one to get, so after buying the Repertoire version, I finally found a Sad Wings Of Destiny CD that is what it should have been: excellent sound quality. DO NOT get the Koch Records CD if you value good quality reproduction. Get the German Repertoire CD instead. It's a bit more money, but completely worth it. This is a must-have for any Judas Priest fan. Halford's vocals are at his best on this album, whether he's being melodic and somewhat low volume, or at the top of his lungs. His entire range is shown off, as is the early raw combo of Downing and Tipton. Whoever mixed and released the Koch POS CD should be whipped with a studded leather jacket...one of the worst-sounding CD versions of a great original album I've ever heard.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Just got a missing song I thought should be in this album...Standing in front of me. Overall still an excellent greatest hits album!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is an excellent  combination of suspense as to what will happen in the scandalous lives of Lady Mary of the wealthy class and Mr. Bates of the working class. Maggie Smith's performance is worthy of a golden globe. The sets and costumes are excellent and the focus on the war adds extra excitement to see whom will come home safely or whom will be shattered with the trauma of war.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved this game-from the graphics to the challenging puzzles I couldn't put it down till the end. I would highly recommend it.I feel its worth the money you pay for it.thank you!the only thing I couldn't get into sequel. After rating it
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Especially in 3D! My brain is over stimulated with this intense movie. I can watch it over and over and never get bored of it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Computer is too smart for me! Hard to beat. Computer sometimes takes too long to make a move and if you don't watch the screen you don't know where the move was.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie did not hold my attention. It was a bit to busy to really follow. CGI was okay. I enjoyed the original more.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is very fun. I think that everyone should get this it is wicked. You have a ton of fun getting and evolving dragons.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great CD, especially if you're a Rod Stewart fan. I gave it to my mom for Christmas and she loved it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Lots of fun. As usual have to play each station a couple times to get 3 stars but that is the reason you play it. Great graphics.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact -Tried to determine where this was going - the ending a great surprise!  One of my favorite authors
