B0006399FS|1.0|If your a U2 fan you will with out a doubt be dissapointed. <br /> <br />They said this would be a raw rock'n roll record and the best record that they had ever made, well that was all \\"talk.\\" <br /> <br />Anyone who knows what real music is can tell that this album is an absolute flop and in a few years people will realise that it was crap, not to mention the band. <br /> <br />
0790740443|5.0|Unlike many sci-fi/action films, \\"Soldier\\" stays with you, because it touches the heart with a few poignant, memorable scenes, has an interesting script and character development, and though some of it is derivative and silly, the film has Soul.<br /><br />Much of this is due to a superb performance by Kurt Russell, in the almost mute part of Todd 3465, who was bred and trained to kill, and whose only feelings and thoughts are of \\"fear and discipline\\".<br /><br />Todd 3465 was born in 1996 for the Adam Project, and we see him at 38, replaced by a faster and more durable model of soldier. Todd, presumed dead, is dumped with the trash on Arcadia, a \\"waste disposal planet\\".<br /><br />There are no big budget special effects, but the visuals and cinematography (by David Tattersall) are excellent, the direction by Paul Anderson is perfectly paced, and Joel McNeely's score, along with the atmospheric sound effects, add a lot to the film.<br /><br />Sean Partwee and Connie Nielsen are good as the Arcadian couple who befriend Todd, Gary Busey puts in a fine turn as Todd's captain, and Jason Isaacs plays the bad guy with appropriate meanness.<br /><br />There are some terrific mano-a-mano fight scenes between Russell and his \\"replacement\\" Caine 607, played well by Jason Scott Lee, who was marvelous in \\"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\\", and shows his martial arts expertise in this film as well.<br /><br />The film is free of foul language except for one instance (and one has to wonder why they ruined a perfect score with it), and despite the violence, would make suitable family viewing, because the violence has purpose and meaning...there is nothing gratuitous in this film, which is another reason I appreciate it, and most of all, it has that rare thing in a Hollywood film, a satisfying ending...one that will bring a tear to your eyes.
B00003CXA6|2.0|Gettysburg is a mediocre reproduction of Michael Schaara's historical novel the Killer Angels. There are some parts of Gettysburg that are quite good, such as Pickett's Charge and the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top, but the excess speechifying and moralizing, along with some poor casting choices and poor production qualities, hurt this movie badly. Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.     The history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ? Turner productions is the fast food of TV & motion picture entertainment, and Gettysburg and Gods & Generals are their blue plate specials - bring your antacid when you sit down to watch them.
B000669GAI|5.0|First off, let me say I love Pearl Jam. I've got all the albums, most of the singles, a bunch of vinyl and all kinds of bootlegs, so I wasn't expecting much more on this than a solid collection I could whip up with a CD burner. What I didn't realise is that, like they did with Lost Dogs, the band have included alternate takes and remixed versions of some of their classic older tracks, further cementing the idea that there is no diffinitive version of any track from Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />Any long time fan will notice the subtle differences between the songs here and their original album versions, particularly the Brendan O'Brien remix of Black, and the re-recorded version of Even Flow. All the hits are here, and anyone who has something to complain about with this disc is a cocksmoker.
B00005JM02|5.0|Here is a movie that you can enjoy with kids.  The animation is wonderful to watch (like many recent movies). <br /> <br />Perhaps it is not filled with quite the mixture of adult/children storytelling as Shrek for instance (which I enjoyed more, and is a bit less geared solely towards children), and I would guess if there is a downside, that is it. <br /> <br />If you want something that will entertain children, and still hold some interest for you, this is fine, but it is not a DVD you will probably play without a younger viewer around. <br /> <br />So 5 stars for what it is intended to be....
B000059LGC|5.0|Beginning with a stirring overture (composed by Nino Rota) and incorporating stunning location shots of Egypt and the English countryside, John Guillermin's DEATH ON THE NILE (1978) boasts a star-studded cast.  Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Lois Chiles, Mia Farrow, Bette Davis, Simon MacCorkindale, Angela Lansbury, Olivia Hussey...The only other movie version of an Agatha Christie mystery that rivals this one for the glamour of its cast is Sidney Lumet's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974).  And just as that movie was enriched by the likes of Martin Balsam and Richard Widmark, this one has such great character actors as Maggie Smith and Jack Warden in supporting roles.  The story, based on Christie's own favorite of her novels, concerns a love triangle that is not quite what it appears to be.  All three members of the triangle, along with famed Belgian (not French!) detective Hercule Poirot (Ustinov), his friend Colonel Race (Niven), and a host of others, end up in Egypt, and then on a ship traveling up the Nile.  This is where the beautiful, wealthy, and unscrupulous Linnet Ridgeway Doyle (Chiles) is murdered.  The problem Poirot faces is that nearly all of the passengers had motives for Linnet's murder, and the most likely suspect - her wronged friend Jacqueline (Farrow) - had a water-tight alibi.  Though Ustinov is not my favorite Poirot - that would be David Suchet - he was a wonderful actor and I LIKE his Poirot better than Albert Finney's (in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS).  He is full of savoir-faire, and egotistical but never obnoxious.  He can also be deadly serious, as when warning Jacqueline not to allow \\"evil\\" into her heart.  Niven's urbane appearance and dry wit (Race to Poirot:  \\"Yes, I'd forgotten your opinion about yourself\\"); Lansbury's deliciously over-the-top acting as Salome Otterbourne, writer of \\"trashy\\" romantic novels; Hussey's winsome vulnerability as her neglected daughter, Rosalie; Davis' likeable prickliness as Mrs. Van Schuyler, a rich dowager with a penchant for pearls; Warden's remarkable accent and manner as the German Dr. Bessner; and Chiles' flawless beauty are among the other memorable things in the movie.  Under Guillermin's direction, the action flows to its shocking and tragic conclusion.  With a script by playwright Anthony Shaffer (SLEUTH), this DEATH ON THE NILE was the perfect follow-up to the rightly acclaimed MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.
B000023VR6|3.0|I expected this to be better. It's not a bad album but it's not a big thing. Get the  <br />original \\"Chronic\\" than this.
B0006399FS|2.0|From about 1983 until 2000 you can make a fairly convincing case for U2 being the best band in the world.  The records were mostly amazing (with the exception of \\"Zooropa\\" which was good, not great & half of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" which should have been an EP), while the live show was cutting edge and a huge production. Bono owned the title of world's biggest rock star and showed that they could make a difference. The Edge proved that rhythm guitarists could be godly. Adam was dating supermodels. Larry could have been. Meanwhile, the band were selling millions of records, playing huge stadiums and had a swagger.   <br /> <br />After the amazing & challenging \\"Pop\\" was released, the band realized that they were losing their fanbase (as Rock n Roll in general was slumping) and made a conscious effort to play it conservative and change their sound to a much more straightforward approach.  Hence the overrated, yet decent \\"ATYCLB\\" which signaled in Bono's mind that U2 were once again claiming the title of \\"the world's greatest band\\".  The record was fueled by a few great songs \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"New York\\" & \\"Walk On\\" -yet also showed a blander, more mature side of U2.  The record sold well, was critically acclaimed- and even pop idols were singing U2 songs.   <br /> <br />Enter HTDAAB. <br /> <br />Sometime around summertime, Bono proclaimed that Edge was writing some mean riffs and that the new record was gonna rock and when the general public caught wind of 'Vertigo' the lead single and saw the ipod spots, most assumed we were in for something special.   <br /> <br />Then somebody listened to the rest of the record... <br /> <br />Positively speaking, early returns on the B-sides have been pretty good.  Here's hoping that they continue to leak out and are of high quality. <br /> <br />As for the world's greatest band, that title rests safely in the hands of Radiohead.  I'm not sure at this point that U2 are capable of competing for it again, especially after a misfireof this caliber. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005Y6YB|4.0|There isn't much I can add to the body of comments about the movie/mini-series itself.  Truly one of the great western sagas of all-time.  Great drama, great scenary, truly beautiful musical score.  Perhaps not the most politically correct show of all-time, towards Native Americans and women, but given the story is told from the perspective of frontiermen, that isn't all that out of line. <br /> <br />Without hestitation I rate the movie a 5 out of 5 stars.  A must-see western. <br /> <br />However the video quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired.  It really isn't much better than watching it on TV or on a VCR. Most DVDs, even those of a TV movie, are better than this.  So on DVD quality, I give it only 2 stars out of 5. <br /> <br />Still a great movie and worth purchasing to have in your collection, but it is disappointing that the video quality is mediocre.  Probably still fine on a 32\\" or smaller TV for most.
B000003489|5.0|This CD release is \\"chock-full-o\\" great jazz.  Not only does it contain the original 1959 remastered recording, but it also includes alternate versions of selected tracks.  You can choose which versions you like.  Either way, it's a fine tribute to a man who passed away much earlier than we ever expected!  For Coltrane fans and jazz curious as well.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|When I went to buy this CD I thought it was gonna be simply one band's take on all the 80's rock. I didn't realize it was gonna be exactly the same. Franz writes some great lyrics although the content pointed to some dirty stuff sometimes. \\"Michael\\" makes me want to throw up. The beats could have me jumpin' around the room but \\"Take Me Out\\" was not like the rest of the songs. I've heard that song on the radio for a long time and loved it...but the rest of the CD is not like that one song. If you are a fan of clean rock music, you won't like this CD. It has some nasty things going on in there. When I first put it in my stereo, it didn't sound REALLY good because it has already been done! If you want to hear a fresh sound, don't pick up this CD. If you like exact copies...GO FOR IT!
0671798154|5.0|A good change to the standard WWII thrillers.  Great for reading on a plane, beach, or anything lesure related.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Purely as movies: ****  Philosophy: *****  All this whining here is so pathetic.  So the brothers' movie making abilities are not superb- but who said one must be a great FILM maker to tell great stories, touch millions of people, and open minds in some extraordinary ways???  If one is so blunt to only see the special effects in this trilogy, one should go back to LOTR.  If however one tries to look beyond the visible (and watching ANIMATRIX is the first step =&#62; I bet you 100$ that very most of the MATRIX haters didn't even watch it), I guarantee one will discover the simply greatest tale of our times.
B000056V73|5.0|I'll be straight forward. You will only enjoy watching this movie if you appreciate the art of journalism and history and the formation of Rock And Roll. The movie takes place in the sixties and seventies when rock was starting to lose the effect on fans it once had. I dont think there could have been a better era to base this movie on. Rock was more innocent and more wild all at the same time! The music was soothing-- the kind you listen to while burning an incent and thinking deep within yourself. Then music was based on becoming famous and getting big only in hopes of being exposed to women, parties, s e x and d r u g s. Absorbing this all in your fifteen minutes of fame.        This movie is genuinely produced to satisfy all themes of what movies are typically based on. It is ingenuis!!! Almost Famous reflects the heartbreakes, true love, self -discovery, failure, finding your dreams and the truth behind music. Most movies are set on one particular subject. Cameron Crowe features life lessons all throughout this movie that immediately grabs, the viewer by the horns because of the intensity of each scene!        I started loving this movie as a teenager. Probably because Almost Famous explores the rebelliousness of teenagers and purpose of a childhood. Patrick Fugit's (Williams)  mother, like many, was a rainstorm on his sunny summer day. He was robbed of adolescence. The day William realized his destiny was the day his sister left behind rock records with a note \\" Listen to Tommy with a candle burning and it will set you free.\\" Music is an influence to us and we dont even know how much it impacts our lives! Music places angelic choirs in our head that molds us. This movie hits closer to home to younger generations than anyone else. For example, my grandmother saw this movie and had no interest whatsoever.        The point of view of this movie is that of a teenage boy getting the real life story on rock band Still Water from the side of the stage. He dramatically transforms from a sheltered kid under his mothers wing to a roadie of a famous rock band. This movie really opened many doors for me. Fugit's character proved to me that living an adventurous life leads to the wildest things you could ever imagine and the stories you can tell to people. From getting intoxicated with Band-aids, rooming with Americas favorite band or rising every day to the flamboyant orange and yellow sunrise, not expecting what will happen today. This movie is a rollecoaster! It takes the viewer to highs and lows-- which really keeps your eyes glued on the TV screen. It ranges from Still Waters successes on making the cover on Rolling Stone to a life threatening airplane ride.        Almost Famous is a movie that must be seen more than one or two times. I have seen it twelve times and still learn something new every time! Fugit's character inspires us to get out in the world and meet new people. Those who help you acheive your dreams and learn lifes most valuable lessons. Let go of moms hand and see for yourself a world full of the most wonderful places! The movie inspired me to not let anyone or anything be an obstacle on my journey through life. After all, you only live once. I strongly suggest seeing this wonderful movie. It will make you feel like a child all over again!
0553573403|3.0|First of all, I really tried to like this book. I read the previous reviews in this page and I bought the first and second books at the same time. Then I started to read it... It was quit disappointing.<br />What I don't like about it:<br />- Too long, I mean, there are 400 page without any value (I've read \\"war & peace\\" and I didn't find it too long)<br />- Any time that the story is getting interesting it turns to another chapter without connection with the previous one and it begins a description of a room or castle or whatever.<br />- At the end, It indeed turns out to be more fun, but I don't dare to read the 900 pages of second book.<br />- And Yes I did finish it.<br /><br />What I like it:<br />- It is a very good story.<br /><br />It could have being a page turner but first it should have skipped many pages or even chapters.
B0006399FS|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said about this band? They are the biggest and arguably best band in the world today, have sold more than 100 million albums, won countless grammys, and perhaps most importantly been a critically acclaimed and relevant band for over 20 years. They had nothing left to prove to cement their place as the band of their generation and among the greatest of all time. This album is a gem, and has elements included that are reminiscent of all the U2 eras from the raw, early \\"I Will Follow' sound of 'Vertigo' to the classic \\"One/Stay\\" sounds of 'Sometimes you Can't Make it on Your Own' to the very upbeat \\"Desire\\" sounds of \\"All Because of You\\" to the stunning and likely future classics \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" which has the longest introduction since \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" brings back memories of \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" has a striking similarity with \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". U2 has never made a bad record, with the majority being at least really good, including All That You Can't Leave Behind. However, this one is even better than that last release. There isn't a bad song on the record which puts this album near or with the ranks of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" as a classic album. For a band that has been together as long as U2 to be putting out albums this good is a testimony to their greatnesss and pursuit of excellence. Bring on the accolades for this band and this work! Hope to catch the tour!
B00028HBKM|5.0|In this amazing and compelling account of the last hours of the life of Christ, Mel Gibson appeals to viewers on an emotional level by portraying the horrors, the Son of God went through on behalf of mankind. His intense realistic effects keep viewers bearing enough pain without leaving their seats, in order to get across the real repose the Savior of the world suffered. Staring James Caviezel as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern, (Mary), and Monica Belluci, (Mary Magdalen), it's based on the four gospels; mainly out of the book of John. It portrays Jesus, on the road to crucifixion, being beaten and whipped by roman soldiers, only to have a crown of thorns put on his head and be lead away by Pontius Pilot, to be put to death by Roman justice. It then flashes back to earlier times in the Carpenter's life as he journeys toward the actual agony of hanging on the cross, such as the \\"Sermon on the Mount.\\" The movie is in the original Hebrew language with English subtitles; but doesn't take away from the intensity. A person would no doubt stay alert at this drastic film of an event that will leave a lasting mark, or at least make them feel more compassionate about the passion of the Christ.
B0006399FS|5.0|By far the best U2 CD since Joshua Tree.  Even though Vertigo seems to be the hit from this CD, there are many songs that blow Vertigo away.  The lyrics seem to be personal.  Don't pass this by.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm going to be honest with you all: this is NOT the original Star Wars.  I don't know what George Lucas has been thinking lately - especially with the latest 2 movies: \\"Attack of the Clowns\\" & \\"The Phantom Plot\\" - but to tell you the truth even altered these movies are pretty good.  The plots are solid and they are still entertaining, even if they are not the classics.  I don't think the changes were inappropriate enough to warrant lowering their ratings that much (personally I loathed the Ewok ending song in the Original Return of the Jedi and am glad to see it gone).  I do remember the excitement when the movies first came out in theatres in the 70's and 80's, but those days are gone, and these are not those movies anymore.  I still recommend these for anyone who isn't terribly offended by the changes (which I agree were not necessary), but they are Lucas's movies, and he can do what he wants with them.  I'll keep this DVD release, but I'm also holding onto my VHS copies of the originals.  Oh yah, don't even waste your time with the latest two movies.
0783225857|5.0|This is, in my opinion, my favorite movie. It is perfect film...directing, acting, cinematography, editing and yes, music.  The music is how scores should be...a part of the story and characters. <br /> <br />The children are outstanding (hard to find in a movie).  You really get the sense of viewing this world through the eyes of a child. <br /> <br />The courtroom scene is by far the best ever made.  I get angry every time the verdict is read.  Gregory Peck's closing argument shows just how perfect he was for the role of Atticus Finch. <br /> <br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is one of those movies that have these great moments that stay with me:  Atticus shooting the dog, Scout looking at the watch, Jem and Scout running to defend Atticus from the mob, Tom Robinson in tears when he states his innocence, Reverend Sykes asking Scount to \\"stand up\\", Atticus inching forward when he is spit upon, Scout saying, \\"Hey, Boo\\"...the list of these moments could go on and on. <br /> <br />And this DVD had one of the best commentary tracks about making films you will ever hear. It is great to hear two filmmakers actually talk about making films.  Modern day producers should listen carefully to the late Alan J. Pakula as he explains what a \\"real\\" producer should do on a film.  Brilliant.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I've never been drawn to see a Will Ferrell movie.  I find his humor sophomoric and mildly entertaining with the exception of a few characters on SNL.  With that being said, I have to say from the moment I saw the trailer I've been itching to see it.  Since I'm not a big movie goer I waited for the DVD.  I figured that this is one that I would like to see for the first time at home with the kids around me, the lights out, the Christmas decorations blazing and eating goodies.  My patience paid off...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!  I can't think of a better way to watch it.       This movie has such heart.  Baby boomers will appreciate the late 50's early 60's Rudolf era feel in the music and even in the beginning credits. I didn't know that Will Ferrell had it in him to actually TAKE the viewer on a journey so you can genuinely feel his character's excitement   (ie  SANTA!!!! \\"OOOOHH, MMMYYYY GOD!!!!......I know him, I know him.\\")  His wild-eyed innocence reminds me of Tom Hank's performance in Big. (They say that comedians make the best actors because of their acting range)  His acting was wonderful and see if you can go 5 minutes between laughs from beginning to end.   Between the \\"Attack of the Dwarf\\" and Buddy trying to put the star on the tree, I almost lost my mind laughing. This is a must see!!!    Remember anyone expecting to see a \\"Will Ferrell Movie\\" might be dissappointed.  Just think like a child and watch the movie through those eyes.  With that in mind you'll like it as much as I do!!!
B00000JLWW|1.0|\\"All this time searching for Titanic...but I never let it in!\\"  (Crying starts now)...  This isn't good writing, folks, it's CRAP.  The characters are bad (bordering on humorous). <br /> <br />Why does Billy Zane's character shoot at our hero and heroine?  Hello, the ship is going down doofus.  And if she didn't jump back on the ship, her lover would have been able to climb up on the wood and survive...just an observation. <br /> <br />I think it speaks volumes when you see the impressive shot of all those frozen bodies in the Atlantic and not shed a tear.  I just thought, \\"Cool VFX.\\"  A movie about this disaster should have brought out true emotions, not forced ones (see the much superior \\"A Night to Remember.\\" <br /> <br />The love story has zero chemistry to boot.  I know that this is a popular flick, but I just did not get it.  Put it this way, if you are like Elaine from Seinfeld and thought \\"The English Patient\\" SUCKED...stay away from \\"Titanic\\"...far, far away.  Unless, of course, you want a good laugh.
B00005QXXO|4.0|This live album has some strengths, and some weaknesses.  As other reviewers have said, the sound quality is good, but not as good as it could, and--rightfully, these days--should be.  It also comes in pretty short for a live album--only 40 minutes.  Since it is Radiohead's only live release, it's a bit disappointing that it's all from [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]] and [[ASIN:B00005B4GU Amnesiac]] (except the beautiful acoustic ballad \\"True Love Waits\\").  Some songs sound different and better than on the album--\\"Like Spinning Plates\\" sounds excellent set to cascading piano, and \\"Morning Bell\\" and \\"Dollars and Cents\\" get a chance to really rock out more than on the albums.  However, songs like \\"Idioteque,\\" \\"The Natural Anthem\\" and \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" don't translate as well to a live album (though I'm sure they were better in person).  My recommendation is this: if you already own and really like Kid A and Amnesiac, this album is for you.  If you like their earlier material better or don't own the aforementioned albums, this CD won't be as enjoyable.  Fans should get it for \\"True Love Waits\\" alone.  Hopefully Radiohead will eventually come out with a better retrospective live album that takes a little more care in production, but until then, this limited-scope collection is all we've got.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|As an Alan Parsons devotee all the way back to Tales of Mystery and Imagination, I had never had to apologize for buying one of his CDs. Finding a new Parsons CD in the store was an unexpected gift and an automatic buy until now. I know that some albums have been weaker than others, but there have always been at least 1 or 2 strong tracks that make the whole album worth listening to.  Not so with this effort.  The usual and expected skilled use of synthesizers and vocals to create textures within the songs has been obscured by so much techno-clutter that it is difficult to recognize the themes.  This is especially true in the two tracks that were updated or recycled for this album (3, 7). The fact that this is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review  demonstrates the level of my disappointment. I hope your experience will be better than mine.
6305971935|5.0|Like another reviewer said, no subtitles on the DVD but the film is preserved in near-pristine condition.  It was remarkable how crisp the images were.  The DVD has trailer, scene selection, audio options and that's about it. <br /> <br />The special effects were very 1980's so you have to overlook that when watching the film.  There's a great sequence where Manfred Mann's \\"The Runner\\" is used for background music.  And a slight continuity error when the Porsche following (and eventually passing) our heroes disappears from the rear window.  And I have to wonder, since our hero is so important to the military's time travel experiment, why are they shooting at him? (duh!).  Oh well, makes for a little more exciting chase sequences.  And then there's that whole time-space continuum thing, what with the events as they play out.  Oops, better to not think about that stuff! LOL <br /> <br />One of the (1984) scientists shows up in another time-warp movie, \\"Groundhog Day.\\"  See if you can spot him.  Also, one of the main doctors is the U.S. submarine captain from \\"Firefox.\\"  And there's a guy on the hospital elevator that later shows up as a bus passenger in \\"Speed.\\"  Nancy Allen gets the Good Samaritan Award for helping out some guys who steal her car, kidnap her, then her car gets wrecked.  But then, how often does a girl get to date a guy that came across 41 years of time? <br /> <br />Michael Pare was definitely a good choice for the film; he plays the perplexed sailor pretty well.  This would be a good double-feature for the time period with Jeff Bridge's \\"Starman.\\"
B000002KXV|5.0|Mr. Fagen, <br /> <br />Your Nightfly CD stands the test of time.  It sounds as fresh now as it did in 1982 when it was released.  Thank you for some great music that I can enjoy for decades to come.

B00005B4GU|2.0|Is it just me or does this CD sound like a garage band banging on the garbage can lids?  Don't get me wrong, I thought OK Computer was very unique and one of the few CD's that I never seem to get sick of listening to but I don't get Amnesiac.  Maybe I'm just too provincial or not into abstract thought as much as everyone is.  I'm not afraid to admit when I don't understand something but a lot of listeners would rather just pretend they do.  I guess everyone wants to be pseudo-hip.
0783225881|3.0|Field is a sweet movie, but at time it's runs to long. The plot is original, and the touch of spirituality is cool. The classic ending isnt that touching and I wasnt weeping for joy.
B00005JMJG|5.0|<br />  <br />Remember when we were happy. This was interesting look at relationships, how our feelings develop, and how we perceive them. Director Michel Gondry captures the beauty and harshness in the entire process of having someone to love and then losing them. Expressing this through memory gave off an interesting concept of how emotions can cloud your thoughts, but the truth lies inside your head.  <br /> <br />Jim Carrey breaks through type to give a wonderful performance of a regular neurotic guy. His character isn't as colorful as past parts played, but nevertheless you are drawn in to his humbleness. Kate Winslet also breaks through type playing you typical impulsive girlfriend. The two were matched together like Romeo and Juliet, made for each other. The intensity of the characters keeps your attention through the entire flick. <br /> <br />It is almost scary of how this movie reminds you of you own horrible relationship experiences. Not without its charm this movie evokes emotions inside of you that may have been pleasantly resting. The cinematography literally takes you on a ride through memories, feeling, and emotions beautifully illustrating the reality of love. This is a must see with your ex if you want to make up.   <br />
B000687M48|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Evanescence and was really excited to hear the release of a live DVD/CD since I've been to 2 of their shows this year. The concert footage however, is horribly done. The camera zooms in and out of the band in seconds, while digital effects and lights make it so hard to watch. I don't think theres even one scene where the camera lays still on a member of the band. Not to mention, the bad nose bleed angle views from the audience, and too many annoying shots of the crowd. whats the point of that? I got dizzy after 30 minutes and had to shut it off. <br />But besides the horrible visuals, the music is amazing, the band played well and Amy Lee's vocals were on point. The best part was the Korn cover \\"Thoughtless\\" where she took the song to another level.  <br />The DVD also features all of their incredible music videos and a 50 minute behind the scenes documentary, which is worth buying for rather then the concert itself.
B000089RVX|4.0|This is such a great cd. i have to admitt when i first heard \\"bring me to life\\" on the radio i didn't really think much of them but when my friend lent me the cd i fell in love with it. some of my favorite tracks: \\"everybody's fool\\" \\"my immortal\\" \\"touniquet\\" \\"hello\\" and \\"last breath\\". the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because there isn't one happy song on the whole album. i mean i love the songs but listening to the cd for too long can make you really depressed. other than that it's awesome!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|At first I was reluctant to see this film because it looked like a holiday \\"date\\" film.  While this is a romantic comedy, it is also one of the funnier movies I have seen in a long time.  Bill Nighy is certainly one of the funniest characters in the movie and his interviews with the press had me laughing so hard I was crying. <br /> <br />While the movie does try to cover a lot of ground in a small time period (there are 8 couples and story lines to keep track of), it does all come together in the end.  What works about these various story lines is that they all have different types of loves and are at different stages in their lives.  I found myself thinking \\"I remember when I was there\\" and wondering what love has in store for me in the future.  Maybe, like the Bill Nighy character I will learn that I really do love some of the people that right now I find annoying. <br /> <br />Yes, this is a feel good movie and yes, it is a romantic comedy.  However, loving is part of being human and I think that most people can identify with at least one of the many characters or storylines.  If you're old enough, you will probably identify with more than one.  I know that I did. <br />
B000000Y27|5.0|I look at Wes Montgomery now as an icon, an influential jazz guitarist who was really incredible as the title goes The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery. I have for so many years considered Jimi Hendrix to be the greatest guitarist of all time, I still believe this but I feel Wes Montgomery was way up their with him. And as of now I am learning more about jazz guitarist such as Joe Pass another incredible jazz guitarist. This CD has everything on it from the starting up beat tune Airegin which to me is the most complicated jazz guitar song. I also loved D-Natural Blues. As the cover on the back of the CD reads \\"ever since its initial release in 1960, this album has been a consensus choice of musicians, critics, and knowledgeable listeners as a matchless example of the talents of one of the finest jazz instrumentalists of all time. Strongly Recommended!!!!!
B000002J2F|3.0|Duke (1980) saw the now-hardened trio of Collins, Rutherford and Banks modernising their sound (most notably Phil Collins's thundering drum sound, Banks's 'wall-of-sound' keyboards and more chart-friendly songwriting). The band's phenomenal chart success with Follow You, Follow Me must have brought home to them just how more profitable a commercialised direction would be. Misunderstanding, for instance, contains very little of the original Genesis progressive template, but provided a welcome boost to the Genesis coffers in the form of a hit single. Highlights include the opening burst of behind the Lines, with Mike Rutherford doing a splendid job on the guitar (not an easy task taking over from Steve Hackett), Duke's Travels and Heathaze provide some good moments, Man of our Time is pretty chunky in the mode of Deep in the Motherlode, but once again the sound picture collapses under Phil Collins's artillery barrage drums.<br /> Duke is in many way the last officially progressive album Genesis ever made; with the 80s came serious chart success on the backs of Abacab and Invisible Touch, with massive radio coverage, huge tours, entire brass sections, etc. and the our indestructible trio finally enjoying some real income after 12 years of critical worship but chart obscurity (solo projects were up and running, too). The band's fan based trebled, of course, its ranks swelling with young couples, and executives with money to spend on 'quality' music for their car stereos. And Genesis duly provided it - the sales figures speak for themselves - but theirs was a fare no longer as palatable to the fan base frequently referred to as 'spotty 18 year-olds in fishing hats' who could spend hours arguing about the hidden meanings in Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. So Duke can be seen an attempt to straddle that fine line between commercial success and artistic innovation. For Genesis novices I would recommend first going to Trick of the Tail or Wind & Wuthering. You might also like to try Foxtrot, a good early Genesis record with Peter Gabriel giving it large on vocals.Foxtrot, a good early Genesis record with Peter Gabriel giving it large on vocals.
B00066N8JS|5.0|Okay...we all remember this album for its long time favorite track of \\"Closer\\" do we not? Ofcourse we do. Well, while I will say that there are better songs than Closer on this album, I will say that Closer is a good song..Now that we're past this onto the album review. <br /> <br />As stated, we all remember this classic for the phrase, \\"I wanna F**k you like an animal\\" and continue to remember it to this day, for that phrase as well. <br /> <br />But getting past the song Closer and its menogamous lyrics, you'll find some pretty good tracks on this album. Some highlights include the songs, \\"Ruiner\\", \\"The Becoming\\", and \\"Hurt.\\" <br /> <br />We all remember these songs, they were written 10 years ago, and have since then, been sprinkled with magical Reznor power, remastered, upped in quality, and put on a re-released disc for the Deity we all call \\"Halo 8\\" and or \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" <br /> <br />As stated, the deluxe edition of TDS has been digitally remastered and fit to be used with surroundsound 5.1 speakers. The sound is now 10 times better than it originally was, and as stated in an above review, you really can hear things that went un-noticed in the original TDS disc such as actual whispered lyrics in the supposed \\"instrumental\\" \\"A Warm Place.\\" <br /> <br />With that said we move onto the bonus disc of this 2 disc re-release. The 2nd disc isn't a re-release, it's an exclusive to this release of TDS only, and none of the other re-releases come with the bonus disc. The other re-release is 2 sided remastered disc, one side containing the TDS remastered album, the other containing DVD content, such as music vids, and other such footage...ANYWAY... <br /> <br />The bonus disc comes with about 13 tracks, that are b-sides, remixes, and soundtrack-ONLY songs. They all come from singles such as \\"Closer to God\\", \\"Further Down the Spiral\\", and \\"March of the Pigs.\\" Then there are the soundtrack-ONLY songs like \\"Burn\\", and \\"Dead Souls.\\" <br /> <br />The MAJOR EXCLUSIVESto this bonus disc, are the extremely rare, never before released demos of \\"Ruiner\\", \\"Reptile (entitled Liar)\\", and \\"Heresy.\\" Get this edition of TDS for these 3 songs alone, as they are VERY good and NOWHERE else! <br /> <br />The bonus disc too, is remastered, as well. <br /> <br />So to conclude this review..this is a great buy, that you should all GREATLY consider making a purchase of, as this deluxe version of TDS, just like the deluxe of AATCHB, may very well soon be out of print, and extremely hard to find. <br /> <br />GET IT, YOU WILL ENJOY IT!
B0006399FS|5.0|i've been a U2 fan for many years, and when they do or make something stupid, i'm not biased because i'm a huge fan. if they make a bad album, (which, unfortunately, has happened before, but luckily not often), i'm the first to say, \\"come on guys what are you doing?\\" but thankfully, i don't have to say that about this album. i've waited many months for this to arrive and all my fears were put to rest when i heard it. i like ATYCLB but i must admit i like this one more. the last album was a great, great album, but it kinda bugged at how soft it was. alas, they put back in the distortion and heavy effects and it sounds great. this isn't on par with the classics that everyone always refers to, (j. tree, a. baby), but it does blend in perfectly with their catalog. the lyrics are great, the sound is magnificient, and i can tell by listening to it that they worked their asses off on this one. POP was a bad album, but in a way we should be thankful for it because ever since everything they've done has been made with a lot more care and attention to detail. love & peace... & \\"city\\" are my favorite tracks. i can't get enough of them. to those who don't like it i say, \\"well, sorry, you're not gonna like EVERYTHING  they do, but i understand your concerns.\\" for me, though, i've blasted that album in my car all week and i will continue to for a very, very long time. it was well worth the wait to me.
0451167716|5.0|With the publication of \\"The Godfather Returns\\" I decided to read it's predecessor.  I was amazed at the character study that this book represents and the fact that it was written 35 years ago further adds to the intrigue.  This is the story of the Corleone Family and their existence in the N.Y. Mafia.  The story covers a time span of the early 1900's until the late 1940's and it is an amazing work.
B00005JL9B|5.0|Battle Royale is essentially a mix of high school movies, Lord of the Flies, Fortress (the movie that stars Christopher Lambert), The Running Man, and reality TV, among others. With this strange mix, what we have is a pretty entertaining movie about teen angst and social commentary.     Its violent content is slightly overrated since it is not as gory as hyped.  It's not as gratuitious as some Hollywood movies, although the act of seeing kids killing each other will surely test the uninitiated.  In fact, such scenes will make one think about the pointlessness of violence. A violent anti-violence film, if you would.    The film succeeds since we get to know the kids and their friendships, then they are forced to kill each other to survive. Such displays of character depth are important to make us emphatize with their dilemma.  This aspect of the plot has also surfaced in the pop-samurai flick Azumi and the Korean historical drama Silmido.     The acting is believable, given the outlandish plot, since the kids are acting their age.  But what steals the movie is Takeshi Kitano's weary school teacher. His final scene with the phone call was truly hilarious and unexpected.     Get Battle Royale when you see it. It's truly a classic in cult cinema.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|The best album W.T. has produced up to date. Really. If you are a fan of previous albums, you're going to love this. This is also better produced than the earlier albums, so if you are a W.T. novice, this is a great place to start listening to them. Rates high above competitors like Nightwish or Lacuna Coil.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Abattoir Blues/Lyre of Orpheus is a watershed recording for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. In most respects, it is forward looking, as Cave's style becomes ever more disciplined and mature. But he also sometimes gives a nod to his goth past to let his fans know he has not forgotten where he came from. <br />Of the two CDs, I like Lyre of Orpheus best. But as a unit, this is a great work and so deserves a song by song summary of those I consider the best. But first I must concur with a good number of reviewers who think that Fable of the Brown Ape and the title cut on Lyre of Orpheus are throw aways. Those two are the songs which hark back furthest musically to Cave's past without the concomitant lyrical edge. Cave is a fine poet, but when it comes to writing about Orpheus and Eurydice, that task would best be left to the likes of an Al Stewart. <br />Here are the songs I think are best and why. <br />1)Get Ready For Love: A rollicking throwback brimming with controlled musical fury and religious imagery. <br />2)Cannibal's Hymn: A Cave love song of the old school that is constructed on a platform of increasing musical intensity. <br />3)Hiding All Away---An excellent piece of gospel-tinged Southern-fried swamp funk. <br />4)Messiah Ward---A piano-driven enigmatic tune that builds on the new musical foundation laid by Cave on No More Shall We Part. <br />5)Breathless---A folksy ballad accompanied by some interesting flute work. <br />6)Babe, You Turn Me On---A classy, sophisticated romantic ballad in the inimitable Nick Cave style. <br />7)Easy Money---Has an entrancing melody and edgy, suggestive lyrics. One of the album's best. <br />8)Supernaturally---A hard-driving number reminiscent of Cave's Let Love In period. <br />9)Spell---It's simply, well, spellbinding with the spell woven by Warren Ellis' violin.  <br />10)Carry Me---Elegant, somber,and soulful. <br />11)O Children---A soulful stunner, close in spirit to the muse expressed on No More Shall We Part. <br />Those last three along with Easy Money are my favorites AND, speaking of muses, much has been made of There She Goes My Beautiful World, a nice fast-paced song after the spirit of Henry's Dream. Its an enjoyable song about a guy with writer's block seeking a way to recapture his muse. Perhaps Cave had Nocturama in mind when he penned it. Anyhow, while its a good song, its far from being the class of the album. <br />As you can see, I am quite stoked about this recording overall. If you are a Nick Cave fan who is hesitant about this after Nocturama (c'mon, it wasn't THAT bad), then I give this thumbs up all the way. If you have just recently heard about Nick Cave and are reading these reviews because you are curious, I say to you start with Cave here. You won't be going wrong. <br />
0385720920|3.0|Chuck Palahniuk has written some great books over the last few years.  In Choke his skill with narration is still top notch.  Choke is a quick read full of hilarious and gross moments.  The main character Victor Mancini is a con artist that fakes choking spells to capitalize on people's generosity and finds sex by going to sex addiction anonymous meetings. The characters that Victor encounters along the way are just as depraved.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Mr. Palahniuk keeps coming up with clever ideas, but Choke lacks the intriguing story lines of his previous works.  Even so the writing is good enough to make the book enjoyable.  Choke is required reading for all Palahniuk fans, but for those trying to introduce themselves to his writing there are better places to start.
B0006399FS|4.0|This album really sums up U2's career in one album - the energy of Boy, the soundscapes of Unforgettable Fire, the spiritual yet driving melodies of Joshua Tree, the darker rock of Achtung Baby, and the simple songs of ATYCLB.  Because of this, it sounds like it could have been a greatest hits album but all the songs are new.<br /><br />There has been some mixed responses to this album.  Most of the serious criticism comes from two sources.  Criticism One - some people are disappointed that this isn't the all out rock monster that Bono promised a while back.  Well so what?  Get over your preconceptions and realize that this is a very balanced album, with rockers, ballads and everything in between.  Besides, people should know by now not to listen to Bono, he gets overly excited sometimes.  Criticism Two - U2 does not push boundaries on this album.  I will admit that I have always admired the way U2 always tries to push themselves in new directions, but what is wrong with U2 making an album that just sounds like U2?  This album simply plays to their strengths.  Does that make it safe?  Maybe.  Does it make it bad.  No way.<br /><br />If you can, get the Collector's Edition.  And not just for the DVD and book, but because the bonus 'Fast Cars' track is great.
B00005RDRO|5.0|My hat is off to Neil Simon for this incredible movie.  I grew up watching this movie and by the age of 15 I realized...nobody done it! It's seldom that a movie comes along this hillarious that makes one really think about who done it.  The premise, an eccentric millionaire (Truman Capote)with a bone to pick, invites the worlds five greatest living detectives to dinner and a murder.  Wang (Peter Sellers),Marbles (Elsa Lanchester),Pierre (James Coco), Charleston (David Niven) and Diamond (Peter Falk) are locked in Twain's (Capote) mansion, filled with mysteriously moving rooms, a blind butler (Alec Guiness) and a deaf and mute maid (Nancy Walker).  A \\"murder\\" is committed and the detectives each render a who done it.  But who really did what? <br /> <br />Eileen Brennan, Maggie Smith and James Cromwell also appear and together with the detectives, deliver the most hillarious lines and observations.  The plot defintely deserves a nod and I couldn't be happier with the DVD presentation.  An interview with Neil Simon sheds some insight into the casting and ideas brought out in this hysterical comedy.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Most critisms of Britney Spears are valid: her blatantly calculated coy-here-overt-there sexual image, her limited vocal abilities, the premature release of her \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. But the truth is, the music on this album speaks for itself. Britney Spears is hardly prolific, but she has a knack for some of the best dance pop this side of Madonna. She has created some of biggest top 40 hits of the past 5 years, and this stands as her best album yet because it is not bogged down with the filler which usually mars her releases (anybody remember \\"Soda Pop\\"? If not, you're not alone; if so, i feel sorry for you).     Britney's singles are strong, and the weaker ones (sappy balads \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\") are omitted completely. Perhaps Greatest Hits is a misnomer, but this collection is strong. Everyone's heard these songs, but it can be reiterated that \\"Toxic\\" is a fabulous and original dance track and possibly the piece de resistance in this set, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is a sultry beat driven track, and \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is pure pop perfection. Along the way, we also have extremely solid pop tunes like the thundering \\"Stronger\\" and the bubbly \\"Sometimes\\", akin to Madonna's \\"Cherish\\". Balladry was never Britney's strong point, but the two included are solid efforts. \\"Everytime\\" is haunting and moving, while \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" is perhaps the most honest thing we'll ever get out of Britney (incidently the song was written for her).     The new tracks here are noteworthy, especially the party-starting \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" but its the hits that carry the set. The aformentioned songs are the strongest, but the other songs are nostaligic fun as well: the Neptunes-produced \\"Boys\\", the straight-forward dance track \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\" and the obligitory gripe about fame, \\"Lucky\\". Fans will also appreciate the inclusion of the single versions of \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Boys\\" and \\"Crazy\\", which werepreviously unavailable on Britney's albums. My one objection to the album is the inclusion of \\"Outrageous\\", which aside from being questionable as a single (no video was ever released, and the song hardly made a splash at radio), is the most generic, boring and derivative song on the set. Otherwise, I highly recommend taking a ride through not just Britney's hit singles, but perhaps the highlights of top 40 in the past 5 years.
B0006399FS|1.0|The album isn't their worst, neither is their best, far from their best. But the most dissapointing matter is Bono's voice: how damaged it is on this album !! incredibly bad, awful, rough, hoarse and soar. He has a horrible smoker voice, and seems to be non-recoverable. Listen to Bono now is a immense displeasure, just listen to Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, A Man And A Woman, and Original Of The Species. All that makes me gives only one star. His voice is so annoying !!!!    I have to point out I DO LIKE U2, but Bono really sucks here.   I remember an interview in which Bono was asked if he were a political representative, he said \\"I'm a Rock & Roll singer first\\"...     Bono needs to be much, much more humble and to take lessons from singing to recover his voice and learn to handle better with his vocal range damaged by cigarettes.    Equally, the rest of the band don't shine here. Edge is uninspired, because he only uses the same ATYCLB and his \\"classic\\" guitars. Larry only keeps the rythm, and Adam is a little bit better than ATCYLB.    Songs aren't exciting, but I think those ones would have been far better with a finest Bono's voice.     He would not have to be so obstinate and he would have to let try to reach high notes, when he clearly cannot do it.  This album is a vocal disaster.
B000002MU3|4.0|I love R.E.M. They never fail to amaze me. With \\"monster\\" R.E.M. fans either seem to hate this disc or love it. Monster tends to be the album that gets dogged out the most. I will agree that Monster took longer than most R.E.M. discs to get used to..... but it grows on you. Monster has one of my favorite tracks(I don't sleep, I dream) and  my least favorite tracks(star 69) on it. I love monster because it is so different than the rest of their body of work(only other one close would be LRP). I think it's cool that on \\"circus envy\\" R.E.M. seem to be channeling MC5..... CLASSIC! There will always be some debate about R.E.M. some say they haven't released a good disc since AFTP, and other fans say they sold out with OOT.If REM sold out, monster would've never been released. It not a commercial disc by any means. Look at some of their later discs, Monster, New adventures in HiFi, and UP!. Each is completely different from the next, but all good discs in their own right. They keep reinventing themselves and monster was one of their experiments....... some say a good one, others a bad one.......... to me it's REM (they always give me a track or two on all their releases to make the disc worth while).

0345404475|5.0|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is an excellent introduction into the sci-fiction/philosophical masterworks* (*emphasis on master - Dick is a noted literary genius) of Philip K. Dick because this is one of his best works and also most of you have seen a very close adaptation of this book, a film called Blade Runner, which unfortunately was released to box office failure shortly after K. Dick's death, only later to become a cult classic that no one has missed from their DVD collection.<br /><br />Dick's books must be viewed along with writer's ambitions and warnings. In 1968 Dick wrote this story a year before man landed on the moon and yet describes a world somewhere closer to our own, in a `very soon down the road' roundabout way, as Dick does in all his books. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is no different, describing an environmental catastrophic event that leads to Earth's ruin, where humans have migrated to offshore colony worlds, where they get a free human cyborg - a replicant, to serve them. Back on the earth those who remain live in a world where everything is synthetic, the atmosphere radioactive, and where everyone dreams of owning a real live pet, and not a clone controlled by microchips and circuit boards, including our protagonist, Deckard, a professional bounty-hunter cop, with secret ambitions of replacing his electronic sheep with real ones before the neighbours found out how poor he is, so takes on a contract to hunt down and `retire' a group dangerous renegade replicants that escaped from the offshore world colony of Nexus 6, murdering people during the break out and who have managed to make their way to earth blending in with the local population.<br /><br />Deckard who is looking forward to buying some real sheep goes to visit the Tyrell corporation where he uses, the now unforgettable, Voigt-Kampff test, to see if a human is a cyborg. The Voigt-Kampff test is the key to opening the philosophical mindset of this book - \\"Is empathy only a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test. The question then arises for Deckard, \\"has he ever retired a human by mistake?\\" Dick challenges us to think about this (look at the books title) as Deckard runs across the city retiring replicants who appear to lack empathy only to suddenly find himself up against a new type of Nexus 6 that does not lack empathy and has the ability to learn it. The book will keep you second guessing as to who is real and who is not, but at its heart the question Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep in conjunction with Deckard's job, and his desire to own real sheep, leads him slowly down a path of questioning this own existence and reassessing his life and what he thought he knew. The book finished beautifully, answering these questions to the full with a bit of a revelation.<br /><br />However we would do Dick a disservice, not to at least complement the writer's ability to craft the English language, and more importantly, edit his work to perfection. This is a page turner, without any interlude or boring descriptions. Everything will be absorbed at a fine reading pace. Dick also manages to come up with about 70% dialogue, all of it beautifully written with characterisation that actually goes somewhere. The story is also very exciting!<br /><br />You will no doubt read another Dick book after finishing this one even if you do not like science-fiction. I am going to move onto his awarding winning \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" next. And why not? Dick is possibly the best science-fiction writer ever who does not write science-fiction. Maybe the only one that could that.<br /><br />Bravo.nly a human condition?\\" with the psychology that a replicant will test negative for empathy during the test.

B0006399FS|5.0|I am a hard rock kind of guy, i admit it. I like bands like slipknot, and metallica. But i also enjoy bands like coldplay and oasis. I like all rock pretty much. I got into U2 because of my parents. They own all their cds, and i started listening to them a couple years ago. I like all of them, and i think all of U2's cds are good in their own way.  <br /> <br />Personally i like joshua tree and the unforgetable fire the best. I work at a music store, and one day we got in a copy of u2's \\"vertigo.\\" I listened to it that day, and i thought it was awesome. I couldnt stop listening to it. Its one of U2's best flat out rock songs. I was looking forward to the new cd a lot. I then thought about how i felt before ATYCLB came out a couple years ago. I thought beautiful day was one of U2's best songs. I bought the cd, and was utterly disappointed. I only liked about 4 songs on the whole cd, and never really listened to it.  <br /> <br />I was expecting a rocking U2 cd with great, catchy songs like beautiful day. I didnt get that.  <br /> <br />Since vertigo was kind of like beautiful day, i was expecting the same type of cd. Boy was i wrong. This cd is awesome!!  <br />I like every song, and i've been listening to it every day since i bought it on the day it came out. Every song sounds different than the last, but they're all catchy and wonderful.  <br /> <br />Vertigo- I really like this song. Its one of those feel good songs that you find yourself singin along to in the car, while driving real fast. Its kind of short, but its still great. (9/10) <br /> <br />Miracle drug- One of my favorites on the cd. This song is perfect. Its opening, the chorus, the edges guitar work(nice picking), all perfect. Its a nice ballad, and it picks up nicely towards the end. (9/10 <br /> <br />Sometimes you cant make it on your own- One of U2's best songs, and the second best song on the cd in my opinion. This song is so heartfelt, and it makes you want to yell the chorus along with bono at the end of the song. Awesome all around. (10/10) <br /> <br />Love and Peace or else- A great song. Its a little slow at the beginning, but it picks up the pace at the end with the edge going all out. Bono's singing is a little strange, but its a great song.(8/10) <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights- This is one of my least favorite songs on the cd to be honest. The chorus kind of feels like it shouldnt be in this song. I cant explain it. I like the piano, and the guitars. It kind of sounds like a joshua tree song. Its good, but not great. (7/10) <br /> <br />All because of You- Where do i start. This song is awesome! I cant wait to see the music video for this song. It will be U2's next single, and for good reason. Its right up there with vertigo, but its even better. Great guitar and bass work. The only complaint is that the song doenst seem finished. They could have made it a little longer at the end. It just kind of stopped, at the point where you want a little more. It is almost perfect. (9/10) <br /> <br />A man and a woman- I really like the bass in this song. It has a sound all its own. Its the standout track on the cd. It kind of has a latino feel to it. Its fairly paced, and just a feel good song. (8/10) <br /> <br />Crumbs from your table- Along with vertigo and , all because of you, this is another rocker. This is where the edge does some of his best work on the cd. Unlike all because of you, the song feels completed, and it ends on a great note. One of the best on the cd. <br /> <br />One step closer- My least favorite on the cd. Just a slow, downer. Not too special- (6/10) <br /> <br />Original of the species- My favorite song on the cd. It is so great. The 1st chorus, the second chorus, the beginning, and the end sends shivers down my spine when i hear it. The end in particular. Bono just sings his heart out, and its beautiful. The best. (11/10)!!! <br /> <br />Yahweh- Obviously a religious song, and not too shabby. A good song to close the cd with, but it feels like there should be another, better song after it. Its pretty light, and has an ok chorus of bono singing...yahweh. Its ok. (7/10)  <br /> <br />Overall this cd is pretty good. A lot better than the last couple. I hope the next few cds are like this also, but they probably wont be.

Live DVD's are NOT supposed to sound like studio recording, hence the name \\"live\\" If you are complaining that this doesn't sound like the studio album versions then you either A: have never been to a real concert before, or B: are an idiot. People that go to live concerts (or hear live concerts) and say things like \\"god they sounded nothing like they do on there albums, I really wished it was more like their albums, I was disappointed, I really wanted to hear the album\\" should have stayed home and just listened to the STUPID ALBUM, DUH! You people are something else, if a band plays live and is perfect, you say \\"it was too close to the album version, I would have liked to see them do something different live\\" then if they don't play the album perfect you say \\"god I wish they would have played it like the album\\" I should smack you people, are you on crack?!  <br />Anyway, my review: This isn't really my genre of music, but they do an good job. I think it would be hard to do this type of music live, after all its not that heavy, and with her voice, and the notes she hits, she cant be dead on every time, but for you thick-skulls we could play a prerecorded track for you like Ashley Simpson if you like? ...well it's a good DVD, and I own a lot. The performance is good. For a live DVD the mix isn't too bad, although the guitars could come up a little. My beefs with it are the camera that jumps around too much, it can give you a headache! ..and last but not least is the: song selection. I would never try to bore an audience with sappy elevator music like the songs \\"Breathe No More\\" and \\"missing\\" I would have done 2 other covers before I went that route. Overall: good DVD  <br />Interesting note: Most of the members of this band like death metal. Amy has also mentioned the possibility of doing a heavier album, If their next album is heavy, then I'm going to laugh in the face of all you mainstream listeners.

0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains exceptionally important content for people of all walks of life.  Suitable for both the rich and the poor, the book explains concepts about handling money that anyone can benefit from.   <br /> <br />The presentation of the book, on the other hand, is somewhat lackluster.  Much of the information within the book can be found within the first few chapters, which is fine in this sort of book if it is expanded upon in later chapters.  Unfortunately, this is only somewhat the case, as a sizeable quantity of information is repeated constantly throughout the book.  Of course, it could be interpreted as a \\"recurring theme\\" of sorts, but it is neither cleverly or seamlessly woven into the text as a recurring theme should be.  That's not to say, though, that the writing is terrible.  On the contrary, much of the information in the book is written in an easy-to-understand manner with anecdotal evidence.  Additionally, a nice touch that sets it apart from a lot of other books on the same subject that I have read is that there are occasionally a few diagrams that help to explain topic being discussed in the text.  My only gripe is that there aren't enough nearly enough of them. <br /> <br />In case you were wondering if this book will tell you exactly how to get rich, it will not.  The book does not contain too many specific examples of or go into detail about actual techniques that can be used to obtain money.  Instead, it gives the reader information about the concept of handling money and the psychological aspects of obtaining money.  All in all, it is a must-read for book for any person who is interested in becoming financially independent, but it is only a stepping stone to actual riches; I recommend picking up a book on a financial topic (real estate, investing, patents, etc.) of interest after reading this book in order to learn the specifics of the subject.
B00005JLR8|5.0|In America opens with a short excerpt where Christy (Sarah Bolger) is quoting her late brother Frankie while the audience can see a short scene from a home video on a digital camcorder as her Irish family is leaving a painful past behind them as they venture to United States through Canada in a beat down car in the hope of a better life.  The road leads them to the Big Apple where the father, Johnny (Paddy Considine), can pursue his dreams of becoming a successful actor on Broadway.  However, things do not go as planned as the family members face poverty, a heat wave, and the mother, Sarah (Samantha Morton) cannot get a job as a teacher due to their illegal immigrant status.  Instead, Sarah takes a job at an ice cream parlor in order for Johnny to get his acting career started, but it seems as if Johnny's artistic career never will materialize.  All of this is in the perspective of the daughter Christy's eyes and the lens of her small digital camcorder.<br /><br />Christy and Ariel, the two daughters, make the best of the situation as they live in a crack house with constant danger surrounding them.  However, the danger never seems to bother the girls, which supports the notion of children's resilience to environment.  On the other hand it is obvious that the children are affected by their atmosphere, for example, they are faced with a staring silence as they enter their rich Catholic school on Halloween with their home-made costumes.  Nonetheless, the children want to go trick-or-treating, which can be difficult if one lives in a crack house.  The two girls knock on every door in the apartment complex, but no one opens until they get to the door that has the words, Keep Away, painted in white.  Christy and Ariel are aware that the man living behind the door has rightfully so acquired the nickname \\"the man who screams.\\"<br /><br />The man who screams, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), is an anguished Nigerian painter that has locked himself away in order to deal with his pain and suffering in solitude.  When Christy and Ariel knock on the door Mateo's screams turns into a feeble smile as the girls want to trick-or-treat him.  The girls innocent trick-or-treating seems to open an internal door into Mateo's soul, which allows him to feel the warmth, kindness, and love.  The girl's innocent kindness brings out kindness from Mateo and as a result Sarah invites him for a meal.  This leads Mateo and the family together in reciprocal friendship where their true feelings will be shared, which will end in personal growth for each family member.<br /><br />Jim Sheridan's story is based on a script that he and his sisters Naomi Sheridan and Kirsten Sheridan have written together in memory of their late brother who past away during childhood.  It is evident that the death has affected the Sheridan's as they deliver a complex and emotional tale of closure.  However, the Sheridan's do not focus on death, as they bring attention to life and its many difficulties.  Jim Sheridan depicts these difficulties through several small subplots such as Johnny's struggle to get an air conditioner into the apartment, which demands a lot of physical strength, humility, and patience.<br /><br />Jim Sheridan plays with spiritual values throughout the film through many different ways as he portrays life and death.  One of the scenes that brings strong spiritual symbolism to the film is when Christy and Ariel dress up for Halloween.  Ariel dresses as an angel, which symbolizes Christianity and a monotheistic religion, while Christy turns into a faun representing a pagan belief, which represents a polytheistic religion.  The girls are not necessary pagans or Christians, but it becomes an analogy to how differently they deal with the death of their brother.  This spiritual web covers In America from the beginning to the end, as the family never discusses what happened to Frankie, which leaves the family in some sort of emotional twilight as they go on with life.<br /><br/>In America tackles several issues in a sincere manner, which amplifies the cinematic experience.  For example, the addition of the clips from the digital camcorder offer a genuine affection that enhances the emotional difficulties of the family.  The closure of the film offers much contemplation in the backdrop of life and the continuum of life, which will bring the audience to tears.<br /> <br />In America tackles several issues in a sincere manner, which amplifies the cinematic experience.

B0001GL3K4|5.0|First off I would like to say the film is really superb.  I mean you've seen teh reviews others, I'm sure, and you've heard what other's say.   I do beleive everyone should see it for themselves.   It's a movie that you can watch with 10 people or just yourself and the state of mind is to be pretty welcoming. <br /> <br />This is very different than the the director's other films like 4 Weddings and a Funeral, or Bridget Jones.  Both of which I'm not a fan of.    Hugh Grant is like a character which is a mix of both those guys in either film.     His character is the Prime MInister of the time and is very funny.   I was a bit disconcerted by the fact it was a woman that made the Prime Minister take a stand, but hey what ever floats the boat.    Love can make you do many things....look at Napolean and Josephine or Antony and Cleopatra. <br /> <br />But what I just have to say is that it's a romantic comedy which is far from the normal sap that we see in a lot of American crap.   Their's a different feel in how the romance is portrayed and expressed.     Your not like....oh that's so sweet.  Your laughing at their bumbling and women can feel the passion not only from the men but also from the men.  An expression or a word or somethign is used just to show what they want.    This is far from the ordinary chick flick, as men can relate on more than one ground with any of the male character's.     <br /> <br /> <br />I normally don't like films or books for that matter that have more than one romance for the only reason that people can't carry it.   Authors fail miserably and film makers are idiots about it.  But I must say this director or producer carries it off very well in this film.    You get the backgrond of everyone where their coming from, past relations and what their making of the future...and it's hilarious. <br /> <br />Now this last statement is for the person who was making statments about the politicasl theme.   Dont' believe them, the person made it seemthat the entire film was a some of kind of political statement to the world.  Bull, only one scene and not that memorable.   I'm an american who lived in Britain so yeah I know both histories and politics very very very well.      <br /> <br />The movie does take a jab at America...but it's rather interesting.  This woman was saying how insulting they were.  In actuallity not only are they righth about the way America is expressed in the nation...this is coming from someone who doesn't know politics, though.   America is classed as a bully.    But in most instances Britian has it's head up American ass.  But I can say this right now.   But one this is for sure....America would never mess with it's alliance with Britain.      Why?   It loses Britain it loses Europe, in losing Europe they lose Russia, and the countries of the former USSR, then they lose the Caucas, at losing the these parts, they lose Mediterranean and massive parts of Asia.     China never really liked us anyway.   Then there's Africa...and since Europe has the majority of the military there....we've lost Africa and hence then we've lost the Eastern and Western Hemisphere leaving us as Americans with only South America.   Why?  Because we've then lost many British Caribbean Islands and french Islands, and we've lost our alliance with Canada.  So for the person who feels that in some way that the film was insulting, get over it.  If your an overzealous patriot, then this is definiely not for you.   But if your an average person who doesn't swing politically anywhere or your a liberal who knows that a movie is just a movie then go for it...and you shouldn't even be wanting to Turn Away!    The film is excellent political statement or not. <br /> <br />And if you can't put a political theme in a movie where can you put it.   IT's like them Mississippi Burning shouldn't have been a movie made...racism exists, politics exist.   Adn much like media...film is a way to express what you want and do what youwant.    There is no right or wrong place...you just do it.   And I think the director/writer/producer's did an excellent job on what's going on!! <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway I think all of you wil enjoy it!Peace!

But when the person sitting next to me in the airplane, on my way back from thanksgiving, busted into superlative compliments, I was even happier about my choice.<br /><br />Holiday on Ice is the Christmas spirit antidote. It's the Bible for all of us who are sick and tired of the commercialism surrounding this time of year. Read this book now, and save yourself from the holiday spirit.<br /><br />\\"SantaLand Diaries\\" had me rolling down the floor from the laughing. David Sedaris' observations, are hysterically funny, and hold a high degree of truth from what our pop culture has made of the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br /><br />\\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family\\" had me confused for a moment. The story is told on a woman's voice, in first person, which made me double check the cover of the book, and make sure of the author's gender. Yet, he has done an excellent job with this short story, and the narrative will make you begging for more.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" is probably the best story of them all. If you are as sick of the holiday commercialism as I am, you will enjoy this as well. This story embodies, exactly what Christmas should not be about. The competition between two families during the Christmas season goes beyond any normal person's conception. Is it madness? I think not. Just take a look outside of your decorated suburban windows. You will know exactly which people \\"Holidays on Ice\\" is talking about.
B0006399FS|3.0|This album is not U2's greatest - nor does it in any way, shape, or form, SUCK...  Let's give it a fair and rational treatment: it belongs in the middle of the pack somewhere.  The Joshua Tree is Mount Everest.  U2 has climed Everest once, probably never to return, and this we can't reasonably expect.  Arguably the Beatles are the only ones to plant flags there before the boys from Dublin.  On the basis of The Joshua Tree alone, they deserve our reverence.  Beyond that, their greatest achievements are the raw, youthful, in your face, and political first three albums (Boy, October, War) and a smattering of songs and sounds from across the years.  I am always shocked that people rank Achtung Baby with Joshua Tree - aside from the fabulous Even Better than the Real Thing, and the likewise good One, Until the End of the World, and Ultraviolet, is it a real front-to-back classic? <br /> <br />At any rate, I've seen lots of comparisons of this one to ATYCLB, Achtung Baby, and Joshua Tree.  I think this is a wider and much more subtle blend of U2's repertoire than people have acknowledged.  Early on in the disc, there are definite echoes of POP from Adam's and the Edge's directions.  Later on, especially in One Step Closer, the soft, eerie atmosphere is more reminiscent of The Unforgettable Fire than anything - picture in your head that mystical picture of the castle the next time you listen.
B00007KMP1|4.0|This is the first Beck album that hasn't been released on vinyl.  Why?  Because they made a decision to support SACD as the replacement of the \\"vinyl sound\\".  It was originally recorded onto 2 inch multitrack tape and mastered to DSD from the original analog mixdowns by Bob Ludwig, who you might remember from the fabulous HDCD of Econoline Crush's The Devil You Know.  He's one of those \\"famous mastering engineers\\", as apposed to the vast majority who unfortunately go uncredited...well, maybe that's because the hidden ones are responsible for all the garbage sound out there.  Who knows...  Anyway, I think mister Ludwig has replaced (or supplemented, perhaps) his affection for DCS and Pacific Microsonics gear for this new DSD stuff.  I can't say I blame him.  The result is gorgeous and me thinks extremely faithful to the original sound of analog tape.  I've never heard \\"P\\" \\"D\\" \\"B\\" \\"T\\" and \\"S\\" sounds in the human voice that were so accurately reproduced outside of vinyl or theatrical SDDS (the high end Sony movie soundtrack standard).  These percussives and sibilants simply sound right to me on Sea Changes and I don't think it's just the microphone they used.  There's body to that \\"baa\\" sound in each \\"B\\", and \\"D\\"s never sound like \\"T\\"s.  Oh, and did I say it sounds big?  Well it does.  The louder you play it, the bigger it gets.  That seems to be a litmus test of sorts I've found for sound quality.  If it suffers the louder you play it, then it's of poor quality.  Volume is not detrimental to high fidelity, but rather lets it breath...within limits of your hearing comfort/health, of course.  Musically, this is the least alt rock or funky of any Beck release, but builds a bit on the acoustic flavors he used in Midnight Vultures (another fabulous HDCD release).  This latest release was pleasant, but just didn't pop for me at first.  After about the forth full listen I've gotten to the point where if I start playing it I have to sit through the whole thing.  That's a good sign.  I think Beck is really growing as a vocalist.  There's texture and nuance that reminds me subtly of Bjork's growth (though they both sound totally different).  There's stuff they each uniquely do way in the back of their throat or in the relaxation of their cheeks.  You just know they're getting real creative at how they're moving their anatomy, and in popular music you just don't see that enough.<br /><br />5 stars for sound.  4 stars for the album.sign.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell continues to show a comic prowess that I love in the movie Elf.  He plays Buddy, a human that as an orphaned baby snuck into Santa's bag one Christmas Eve.  Santa, played by Ed Asner, doesn't discover the child until he gets back to the North Pole. <br /> <br />At that point, he designates one of his senior elves, played by Bob Newhart, to raise the youngster as his own.  Even though Buddy is over six feet tall, he is unaware of the fact that he is not an elf.  Unfortunately, he is not able to produce toys like the others, and that eventually leads to him finding out about his human roots. <br /> <br />When he is told the story of his past, Buddy decides that he wants to meet the man who is unaware of Buddy's existence.  Buddy's mother passed away, and she never told Buddy's father that the baby existed.  So armed with an old snapshot of his parents and a snow globe of New York, Buddy leaves the North Pole to spend Christmas with his human family. <br /> <br />It's difficult to imagine anyone else pulling off the role of Buddy.  The closest I can think of might be Tom Hanks' performance in Big.  Buddy is definitely a man-child, but Ferrell plays it straight and does not seem to try overdoing it. <br /> <br />This is a sweet film that offers a lot of the elements found in other family Christmas films, including Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, and A Christmas Story.  Even if the ending is not really a surprise, it is certainly a pleasant gift.  Elf is a movie that should be watched and shared with family. <br />
1400032717|4.0|I recently joined a book club and this was the first book we decided on reading.  It was a book that I have been wanting to read anyway so I picked up a copy. Some people in our club found the book hard to read because of the odd number of chapters and tons of mathematical references.  I will be the first to admit that some of this stuff did throw me for a loop. It is almost like walking around with two left shoes on...But that must be what it is to be autistic.<br /><br />I have never read a book that detailed the inner workings and points of view of someone who is autistic.  The contanstant fear of being touched. Being confused by lies because lies aren't truth.  Christopher identifies mostly with Math and animals...because they are almost always the same.  They are governed by rules not emotions. Rules are easy for him to understand.<br /><br />This is an excellent book overall and I highly recommend reading it- for the experience of being in Christopher's mind if not for the literary accomplishment that Mark Haddon has made writing a book through the eyes of an autisic teenage boy.
0061020710|5.0|If you haven't travelled Pratchett's Discworld yet, you're not alone. Mr. Twoflowers hasn't travelled it yet, and he lives there. Feel free to join him and his reluctant guide, Rincewind, as they sample Discworld's dives, tavern brawls, dragons, assassins, pirates, and a charming assortment of near-death experiences.<br /><br />Twoflowers has the tourist's implacable confidence that every demonic temple, every hero with a magic sword, every brigand, and every catastrophe of nature was placed and scheduled for his amusement - and will hold still for a picture. He's also quite convinced that, as a tourist, he's immune to any possible harm.<br /><br />That premise give Pratchett's comic genius plenty to work with. Even Death - the Reaper himself - is just a straight man in this world. (There's also The Luggage, but I'll let you discover that for yourself.)<br /><br />This is the first book in a long-lived series, and gets it off to a great start. I have to warn you, though, there's no such thing as one Pratchett book. Even one is enough to cause addiction.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JMJG|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It's a movie about a man, a very shy and unsure man, who meets a girl a falls in love with her.  They have good times and some bad times.  He finds out that she went to this company to have every memeory of him erased from her mind and then he goes as well.  During the erasing, the movie is played out in his mind, usually ending badly in each memory as she is erased from existence.  He eventually realizes he does not want her gone and attempts to fight the treatment from inside his mind with her. <br /> <br />Excellent movie with a good message and wonderful acting from everyone.  Kate Winslet is pretty cute and a \\"different\\" girl and Elijah Wood plays a character that you really love to hate.  Jim Carrey plays his most serious and best role ever.  Great movie!
0553381687|5.0|I've heard some people claim that fantasy books don't count as true literature.  In many cases I have to agree.  Shallow plot lines with cookie-cutter stories and poor writing styles dominate.  Despite this, there are those few authors who produce pure gems.  Novels that grab a hold of the reader and guide him through an incredible world filled with history and suspense.  Martin is easily the best modern(I won't compare him to Tolkien) fantasy author that I have ever read.<br /><br />One of the complaints I have heard is that many people don't like a story with so many points of view.  I'll admit, sometimes it can be frustrating ending a cliff-hanger chapter with my favorite character and not picking him up again for another 100 pages.  Personally, I think that this style adds to the true main character of the story...the Seven Kingdoms.  This story is more about the land than any one character.  Sure, I've grown attached to some characters more than others(MARTIN, IF YOU KILL OFF JON OR TYRION...!!!), but in a vague way, the story is more about the kingdom in general and even the common people(odd statement considering the POV's are from the higher classes of society).  As Varys puts it to Eddard Stark: \\"I serve the realm, and the realm needs peace.\\"<br /><br />If you want a simple, fun story then this might not be for you.  However, if you want an incredibly complex story written by the most talented author I have read then this is a must buy.  I should also warn that some elements(sex, mature themes, vagueness of good and evil) may make this novel inappropriate for young readers(One thing that's great about LOTR is that parents can read it to their kids at younger age and it will still be enjoyable).  I'd recommend Lloyd Alexander and Brian Jacques for kids approx 8-13(although both are still enjoyable reads even as an adult) and Michael Stackpole for kids approx 13-adult(before I read Martin this was my favorite author, but most people prefer Jordan or Goodkind in the same age bracket).bracket).
B0006399FS|4.0|I still think \\"Vertigo\\" is an excellent single, and just by the way Steve Bono hyped this album to be, implying that listeners were going to hear more of the Edge. Well after listening to this one about three times already, I can't say Mr. Bono was right but I sure as hell can say, this album grew on me, like the way sticky fungi grows on produce that has been soaked outside for too long.......ok so maybe the analogy was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> <br />I think, this is a triumphant or maybe even, a grandiose return for the band that had a rough time paving a clear direction for their music in the 90's. In \\"Original of the Species\\" during the last chorus, Bono goes a bit off of the melody (Which he is one of the only vocalist that could do so and get away with it I might add), and yells \\"yeah.\\" It's an impromptu, beautiful sort of moment we usually only get to hear in live appearences of the band. The happiness and energy is leaping out of the song and becoming something more than just the lyrics, vocals, and instrumentation and it's a theme throughout the album, a theme of pure joy. Where 2000's Grammy-winning beast, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" had very similar joyful and well-crafted songs, on U2's new album they actually speak more for themselves. In exchange of the strucutre and polished sound of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", the spirit shines through their return to a raw sound not heard since the wonderfully pieced \\"The Joshua's Tree\\". <br /> <br />There were a number of different producers whom all contributed something to the album, but nonetheless it maintains a consistent tone. To me it sounds like something new for U2, but since past comparisons are what everyone likes to hear... the blues of \\"Rattle and Hum\\", combined with the soar of \\"All Because of You\\", the grunge of \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" and the multiple layers of \\"Achtung Baby\\". Every song sounds like it belongs within the spirit and framework of the album whether it's the steady bass and captivating melody of \\"A Man and A Woman\\", or the industrial Blues of \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", the heartache of what is sure to be the second single \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\", which also features Bono's best vocal effort on the disc.  <br /> <br />You're going to hear a lot of people say something along the lines of \\"this is U2 sounding like U2\\" or \\"doing what they do best,\\" and there's some validity to those statements, but it's also something they've not really done before. But it still feels fresh and is not simply a re-tread of past ideas. The overwhelming theme of the album is what makes it intriguing: the songs are often joyful, triumphant even the wisftul painful ones have some type of bombast or anthemic ringing that makes them far more cathartic than bath-tub-suicidally-depressing. And likewise even the happy songs often have lyrics that point to being confused, lost, or saddened. It might seem like a simple mishmashing of ideas and directionless, unthought-out songwriting, but that's not what it is at all. It's a picture of a man or woman facing the world, and all its hurdles and obstacles, and deciding to take it in stride and stand up tal regardless of the challengel. It symbolizes the thin line between the darkness and light that stands higher than either, because we can't grow without both of them pushing at us to compose us of what we are, humans. That tension runs through the whole album. This is often reflected in the lyrics, such as \\"A heart that hurts is a heart that beats\\".  <br /> <br />And maybe it's true that U2's other albums have the same sorts of feelings running through them, but here to me anyways, it seemed more direct. There's guitars coursing through it in all directions, there's loudness, and there's also not a weak moment on the whole album. U2 never have impressed listeners because of their intelligence or their lyrical strength, where they find a way to connect is through their warmth, and \\"How to Dismantlean Atomic Bomb\\" does just that.  <br /> <br />
B0000062GK|4.0|Usually I write really long reviews so I'll keep it short. Joe has switched over the years from albums that are mostly hard rock sounding along with an occasional ballad to albums with songs that cover many different genres where the lead guitar serves the place of the lead singer. Although \\"Time\\" is overrated, \\"Lights of Heaven\\" and \\"Train of Angels\\" rank up there with some of the best stuff he has ever done. There are many decent songs on here as well such as \\"Psycho Monkey\\" and \\"Ceremony.\\" As always, Joe is amazing on guitar. Essential for guitar players, but can easily be appreciated by rock fans as well.
0316779237|3.0|I loved The Santaland Diaries and made a fool of myself laughing out loud reading it on the bus to work. That said, however, there is nothing funny about a baby dying in a washing machine. That \\"story\\" tainted the rest of the book for me.
B000001Y5J|4.0|Well, I been a NIN fan since I heared The Downward Spiral came out. So far, that's the greatest NIN album. But hey, that was NIN's third album. Now, we're on to their (well, actualy, Trent Reznor's since he's the only actual member that gets help from other people) EP...no sorry...second album. <br /> <br />The backstory of Trent being so angry in this album, unlike his others, is that his past recording company TVT screwed him over after his first album Pretty Hate Machine. <br /> <br />I like Broken. It is a good album. Eight songs to keep you listening. First, let me start off the track listing with my review on each... <br /> <br />Pinion(7/10): A one minute or so intro. It plays quiet at first and goes louder and louder. The nice effects makes it a good intro to Broken. Sounds like heavy anger. Then, when the song ends, the next song blasts away... <br /> <br />Wish(8/10): A very heavy song. This shows how angry Trent can sing. A nice set of lyrics in this song, such as \\"This is the first day of my last fame.\\" or \\"Wish I was something real in this world full of you.\\" <br /> <br />Last(9/10): Once the song starts, you can hear the heavy gutiars and drums. Trent then sings angrily, more anger in this song then Wish. One of my favorite NIN songs. A very overlooked song and once you get used to the anger, it's all good. <br /> <br />Help Me I Am In hell(6/10): Never really liked this one. Although the sounds and music pictured in my mind somebody about to kill someone. It's short, and actualy, quite boring. No lyrics, although I think Trent could of done better, even without using the singing. Good thing about it, Help Me I Am In Hell produces a small intro to the next great song Hapiness In Slavery. <br /> <br />Hapiness In Slavery(10/10): A great song. Another one of my favorite NIN songs. This is actualy, the only song that really made the media radio. Although the video is really sick, I suggest you stay away from it. I guess that's why it made the song populer, hehe. <br /> <br />Gave Up(7/10): Never really liked this song. Repeative, or so in my mind. Not as angry as the others, and that's what I was expecting. Though, it's not a soft song ether. Yet, it can be good at times. I do like the good fast chours part. But I tried hard to like this song, really did, and just about failed... <br /> <br />Silence(1/10): I hated the silence. I mean, on the CD player, you have to keep skipping and on the tape you have to keep fast fowarding...just to get to the next two songs! Bah. Only good thing is, it fits the album title name, Broken. <br /> <br />Physical(8/10): Pretty good song. Trent sings, kind of, angrily in this song. Although the lyrics can sometimes be very repeative, it's good. The opening of the song is really good and builds it up. <br /> <br />Suck(5/10): Duh. That's why the song was named that. Why? Cause it sucked. I don't like this song at all. Kind of fast, which is a good thing. But...I don't know, just sucked. I usually skip this song, but by time I do that, the album ended. <br /> <br />Well, I suggest you buy this album. It's angry all around, except for Suck and Gave Up. Maybe a few more songs, that FIT the album(angry stuff)and it would have gotten 5 stars. But all in all...it could have been better. <br /> <br />But hey, it's my second favorite NIN next to The Downward Spiral. And NIN's new album With Teeth coming out soon, who knows what will happen next! Maybe some more angry songs on that album like what happen here on Broken?
B0001AP12G|5.0|This has to be the best album to come out this year. Kanye has produced many of the hottest tracks ever. From producing acts for artists such as: Jay-Z, Twista, Jadakiss, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, John Legend, Alicia Keys, etc. There are too many more to even speak of. This album blew a lot of albums out tha water that were actually good albums. From tracks such as \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"Get Em High\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"School Spirit\\", \\"Two Words\\", \\"Family Business\\", and \\"Last Call\\". You usually don't find an album that has that many hits. Kanye held it down for The Roc with this debut album. If you don't have this album by now...then I don't know what I can tell...besides GET DAT AZZ UP AND COP IT.
B000059RL3|5.0|This is an incredible edition of this album (I have reviewed the album itself somewhere else).      Not only does the original sound as good as it has ever sounded but this package includes what is called the 'Detroit Mix' of the entire album, previously unreleased.  It was finished approximately one month before the final mix which was completed in 'Hitsville West' (i.e. L.A.) and which was the mix that was released.    This mix is amazingly fresh.  As I listen to it, I feel as if I am almost listening to an entirely different album.  If I had some technical background I could probably explain it better but when listening to it, it sounds as if I am right in the studio as it is coming together.  It's a bit more raw and you can here with your own ears that there is less production involved with it.  It's not better (nor is it worse) but it is incredible that we have this.  What is really cool is that the two vocal tracks that are dubbed in the final mix are on separate channels and the harmony and main vocal can be heard separate in each ear, especially with headphones on.    The live recording of his performance at Kennedy Center is also a treasure to behold and it is interesting to have the different versions of the song 'What's Going On' included as well.  The 'rhythm and strings mix' is beautiful, helping the listener to realize the instrumentation behind this whole album.    The liner notes are terrific.  Not only is the process of how this album came to be included but you will get actual notes and information on the technicalities of the album itself.  There are more details and trivia here then I've seen on any edition and it takes me one step closer to what it must have been like.  Coming to this album one generation after its initial release, this helps take me back in time just a bit.      If you are a fan of the album, this is a must have.
B00003CXIP|5.0|this is a very good dvd to watch but it is even better when you read the story on it because the thing you see in the dvd mit not come up in the book so that is why you should plan to take the timeout and do this.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|In the mid-60s there was a show called &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; that starred Robert Conrad as James &quot;Jim&quot; West, a western version of James Bond, and Ross Martin as his brainy sidekick Artemus Gordon.  This show was creative and intelligent and yet full of action.  The movie &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline has nothing to do with that television show, unfortunately.<br /><br />Will Smith is another Jim West and Kevin Kline is another Artemus Gordon in an alternate universe that never existed.  In this universe the Wright brothers apparently were asleep as Artemus and Jim were tooling around a giant steam-powered iron spider that is unlikely to exist in any imaginable reality.  Indeed, the only point of any vague historical accuracy is that there was a President Grant and there was a meeting of the railroads.  After that, this movie is &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in the west.<br /><br />In this fantasy movie Kenneth Branagh plays Dr. Loveless.  Once again, forget the wonderful Michael Dunn as the original Dr. Loveless.  Branagh has none of the charm and wit of the original.  Dr. Loveless has decided to create his own empire based on the ability of his giant spider to trounce anyone who gets in his way.  However, he seemed to have neglected to consider that an open cockpit is a sure way to eventually be shot.  Along the way we see a number of other equally improbable devices that make for interesting special effects but continual disappointment with the movie.<br /><br />I have yet to mention that not only is this west some bizarre fantasy version of the original west, but this version of Jim West has a continual string of one-liners that would have allowed him to do stand-up, but not in the alternate reality of this movie where no one seemed to understand his jokes, often including the audience.  Kevin Kline also had a number of humorous lines, though his were more ironic and involved, and typically based on technology that exists only in the alternate reality of this world.<br /><br />This movie does have its moments.  If you like comedy and know little about the original &quot;Wild Wild West,&quot; you may find the comedy overwhelms the total destruction of history and scientific feasibility; or perhaps you like stories of alternate realities.  The special effects are wonderful.  I admit that when I could overcome my disappointment that there was no attempt to remain within the vision of the original show I was fascinated by the gadgets.  However, gadgetry alone does not overcome the unbelievable story.<br /><br />Oh, and as if all the other flaws in the movie were not enough to disappoint a viewer, the DVD includes Will Smith doing a hip-hop song.  Hip-hop in the west?  Perhaps I watched this movie from the wrong perspective.  Maybe if I had taken it for a farce, like &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail,&quot; I would have liked the movie better.  Then again, probably not.exists only in the alternate reality of this world.<br /><br />This movie does have its moments.

B00007KQA3|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out in 1984 and was very impressed with it. It is probably the best film adaptation of a novel, ever. It captures all of the gloom, claustrophobia, and paranoia of Orwell's world perfectly. Each scene seems to jump right off the pages of the book. The casting was particularly good: John Hurt, Richard Burton, and Suzanna Hamilton each fit their roles like a glove. In fact, I recall reading the book for the first time in the early 1970's and imagining Richard Burton in the role of O'Brien: the role that he later played. <br />Having said this, I purchased the DVD version with some trepidation, as many of the Amazon.com reviews I had read complained about the substitution of a classical score for the original Eurythmics score, at the request of the director, Michael Radford. Having now seen both versions, I can say that I liked the Eurythmics score a little better. It created an edgy, surreal atmosphere which fit the story well, as everything in this world which Orwell created is a lie. However, the difference is minor: both scores are rather muted and subdued. Don't let the score substitution stop you from buying the DVD. I have always believed that this film has been underrated by critics and filmgoers alike. The principal criticism is that the film (especially the second half) is very bleak and depressing. As Orwell's story is about the dehumanization of individuals living under a Totalitarian Communist regime, I don't see how it could be anything but bleak! I applaud Michael Radford for staying true to Orwell's vision, and creating this great film. Imagine if 1984 were remade by Hollywood, today. Winston Smith would be played by Brad Pitt or perhaps Denzel Washington. Julia would be played by (who else?) Julia Roberts (No nudity: this would violate the actors contracts, earn an  NC-17 rating, and offend the largely American audience). While in the Ministry of Love, Winston and Julia would wrestle automatic weapons away from theirguards, and, after mowing down legions of stormtrooper-types would blow up the Ministry of Love and escape! Well...you get my point.  <br />        <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|Three hours of a man being beaten, and whiped, and god knows what else. No character development, no message, just brutality. Only a sadist would go to this film.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I love these old movies!  And now that they are all on DVD even better...
B00006CXXU|5.0|X-tina is something else... i do like the look she was doing for this album... she went from wholesome to dirrty like that and i love that.... you have to grab peoples attention and she did that with this album...but the only thing is that what she is going to do next.... <br /> <br />'fighter' is probably the best track she has ever done... i have never heard a song like that before... with her voice and the guitar riffs going off... that was a match made in heaven... <br /> <br />'cant hold us down' w/ lil kim, 'dirrty' w/ redman, 'makeover', and 'get yours, get mine' are ingenious. <br /> <br />'impossible', 'the voice within', 'walk away', and 'beautiful' are the best vocal songs i've heard in years...  <br /> <br />i love this album from head to toe.... this album was different from the pop scene... i wish this album did better than her first album.... <br /> <br />and 1 more thing... x-tina should not do any duets with nelly ever ever ever ever ever again...  <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars... perfect
B00001NFCY|5.0|Out of the three albums Creed made, this was the best one. This was also the catchiest, hooks that were in my head for days!  Higher was the big hit, but songs like Are You Ready, What If, Say I, Faceless Man are very addictive.  The lyrics are very positive on most songs.  I'd like to say this--I like the album version of With Arms Wide Open far better than the orchestral version that they made for radio.  They played that radio version so much that they avoided playing the album's version later on in 2000.  The album version is more adventurous, somber and smooth.  The orchestral version takes the soul out of the original one.  But I like the song and how it talks about Scott Stapp talking to his newborn son.  I think that struck a chord with many listeners and new fathers of babies at the time.  Many of the songs are over 5 minutes or so, but they are all entertaining and rocking.  Although Creed has since broken up, this was their most creative point during that 5 year period!  Excellent stuff!
B000000OUE|5.0|This is a real good album. I haven't heard much from La Sexorsisto or The first one (Amazon says there's a first one before La Sexorsisto that not too many people know about and it's real heavy) but this alone makes White Zombie a great band. It's real trippy metal, their guitarist is awesome. The album starts with Electric Head Pt. 1. It's a real good opener that starts off slow and real wicked and trippy kind of putting you in a trance for a while waiting for what's next, then builds up into a mess of guitars and drums. The drums sound awesome and real fast. Super-Charger Heaven is great. it starts out with a cool sample and goes into a heavy mess. The guitar is great. This song is such a great example of how great this band is. Real Soulution #9 starts up with some crazy Charles Manson related sample. Rob uses his voice in such a way that sounds great in this song. It sounds like someone who smokes too many cigs and has a high voice through a harmonica mic. There's a crazy sample along the music on the bridge that goes with the instruments in such a great way. Creature Of The Wheel is classic. It's such a band heavy song. This song gets itself into my head it's so cool. Electric Head Pt.2 is another classic. It's got Shaft samples. It's such a pimp some. The Drums are used the same way almost on Electric Head Pt.1, alot of fast cymbals bass kind of driving it real fast from sample to sample and verse to verse. Grease Paint And Monkey Brains is a crazy assed song. Not my favorite but I still love it. I, Zombie is crazy too. It's one of the album's heavier. It starts off with a smaple of someone sniffin' coke or something and has a little sound symbolising euphoria and then kicks your butt. Everyone has heard More Human Than Human on the radio. It's got bunches and bunches of the guitarist using a slide. The bass line is crazy. I think it inspired Trent Reznor to use his crazy bass in Closer, It sounds like it's going through a wah or a filter of some sort. El Phantasmo is absolutely a crazy trip or something. The opening part just beats the hell out of you it's so heavy and beyond that it's just crazy tripped out metal. it winds itself down and gets slow towards the end. Blur The Technicolor is okay. Not my favorite but I still love it. It's got cool almost tribal drumming with the bass. Blood Milk And Sky is killer. It's slow and trippy. Kind of has an indian flare to it. In all this is a mighty great album. Instead of wasting money on anything new Rob's put out get this and play it loud. I have yet to here White's others but until then this is it's best. Most certainly heavy.
B000002ORU|5.0|I have seen most bands from that era of brilliant R&R. But the Who were far and away they best live band Ive ever seen. Nobody even a close second. The original four were something beyond magnificent. Original tunes, no American blues rip offs, performances that left you in a daze for days.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is such a great album from one of metal's best, Pantera. This was Pantera's first album by the way. Depending on how I feel I either like this one best or Trendkill. Cowboys From Hell strats has a nice use of instruments and Phil's voice. He uses this crazy 80's metal yell. Not my Favorite but I still love it. Primal Concrete Sledge is a real cool and heavy metal song. Good use of every instrument to create a heavy sound. Psycho Holiday is killer. Another great use of the instruments to create a flow of heavy metal. Dimebag plays so good almost effortlessly. Heresy shines bright and proud. It is one of my most favorite Pantera songs. It's such a fun song, you ride it and you can't keep from nodding your head. It's such a great song. Cemetary Gates is a cool song but it's not my favorite. Great use of the guitar and bass. Domination is a masterpeice. everyone especially Dimebag just put everyone back in their place with this one.  Great guitar playing. just about more than half of the song is just a heavy jam out. Shattered is crazy. Phil uses his 80's metal yelp on it but that doesn't kill it. Clash With Reality is cool. Not my favorite but I don't hate it. Medicine Man is a great song. I think it's about dealin' dope. I think it's cool how they refer to that as the Medicine Man. The lyrics are cool. Sounds great!! Message in Blood is pretty cool sounding. Sleep is cool. it starts off with a cool acoustic part that's great and then gets heavy. Art of Shredding is another pretty cool song. This album is a classic if you're gonna have any Pantera Cd's have this one. Back in the day their sound was cool. Not that their other stuff isn't but this one just flows more so than the rest.And they play longer and heavier for the most part. Sure beats all that crazy rap rock. And Now that Screamo garbage.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|This DVD set is incredible and truly a \\"must have\\" for long time Maiden fans! The concerts alone are worth the cost of the DVD's, but interviews with band members from the earliest incarnations of Maiden show how Steve Harris' vision and willpower rocketed Iron Maiden into the NWOBHM scene, where they took the throne and have continued to reign as heavy metal's royal family ever since! <br /> <br />\\"The Beast Over Hammersmith\\" concert was great to watch. The first tour I ever saw Maiden play live was \\"The Beast on the Road\\" world tour. Watching that concert brought back a lot of memories and made me realize the amazing staying power Iron Maiden has in terms of their live performances. The early Paul Di'Anno performances were great! All the way back to their first video recorded gig (via home video) at the Ruskin Arms! <br /> <br />I am one of those fans that can't get enough of the band, so take that into consideration when reading this review. Never the less, this is truly worth the money. It's a great documentary with hours of never before seen concert footage. Do yourself a favor and travel back to \\"The Early Days\\". <br />
B000002H33|5.0|if u really listen to this album and really think of how long ago it was made you will agree that it is really an album before its time. i mean who else besides slayer and maybe megadeth was this heavy back in 1986, no one was, this is a really great album from beginning to end whether who says its not, i think you will agree with me that this is landmark album not just for metallica but for metal too, i mean what the hell happened to music period, metal these days arent so great in my opinion and nobody is really rockin it straight album after album like these guys did in the eighties. but if you love great music get this album if havent already.
B0001XALTG|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Despite the vile settings and seedy characters there is some odd charm about the film that keeps you coming back for more. The plot revolves around a young man, Mark Renton, and his quest for the true meaning of life admist his drug induced existence. He and his friends trip through life only living for the next shot of H and wondering how to get the money for it. They live in shabby, sparsely decorated flats and live on ratty mattresses and, for the most part, have no goal in life except ultimate pleasure for life. Renton however has more depth and yearning for something more and sets upon a quest to clean up his act and live like those he once denounced. Dark humor and stark realization are constantly presented during the film and thankfully the movie doesnt ever sacrifice one in favor of the other. The soundtrack is also excellent sporting both tried and true rock veterans Iggy Pop and Lou Reed(of the Velvet Underground) as well as modern industrial and techno artists like Primal Scream, New Order and Underworld. This is definitley one of the \\"hippest\\" films of the 90's and one of the best movies I've ever seen period.
B000002KKS|5.0|Black Sabbath had some great albums with Ozzy, namely Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but it all came together when Dio joined the band. Tony always had the riffs but his lead playing became much more melodic and emotional on Heaven and Hell. Dio is just simply one of the best singers ever. His lyrics were still fresh and imaginative despite the fact that he became a bit repetitive in the late 80s. This album has four of the best Sabbath songs ever (and there are many). The album charges out of the gates with  Neon Knights (great riff, great vocals, great lyrics) followed by the classic Children Of The Sea. The other two gems are Heaven And Hell (great riff and cool interlude) and Die Young (cool riff and classic Dio). The other four songs are pretty good too so I enjoy listening to the album all the way through. I highly recommend the Black Sabbath book (post Ozzy) from Rockdetector for details about the making of this classic album!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I adore this movie.  Instead of playing out like an outline of the book (as the first two movies did), it feels like watching something different, something special.   <br /> <br />The director has really captured the \\"magic\\" and it's subtle, not constantly thrown in your face.  He has a lot of fun with the scene transitions and it's really a delight to watch.  <br /> <br />Aside from one incredibly glaring plot hole that would have taken all of 2 minutes to clear up (Harry Potter fans, you know what I'm talking about), I really enjoyed this movie.
B000002GBB|4.0|This album is second only to The Grand Illusion as Styx's best album and it is probably their heaviest next to Equinox. It contains four of my all-time favorite Styx songs: Blue Collar Man, Renegade (kick ass interlude), Queen Of Spades (classic lyrics), and Pieces Of Eight (great chorus). Great White Hope and Lord Of the Rings are good songs too. Aku Aku is a nice relaxing instrumental. I never really got into Sing For The Day, a little too \\"happy\\" for my tastes. The cover could have been a little better but this is a classic album!
0385513755|2.0|I finally succumbed to the will of friends and read this garbage. While at times quite the page-turner -- in a formulaic, manipulative way -- the superficial treatments of the \\"great mysteries of the ages\\" dismantle the whole premise. I'm certainly no cryptographer as the hero is renowned to be, but I was figuring out the \\"clues\\" long before any of the characters were. And the argument that the Bible was a matriarchial text before King James got his hands on it is an old one, so nothing learned there.
B000001EL7|4.0|I can still remember bringing this album to art class back in grade school much to the disgust of most of the girls. Needless to say it was never played again, but at least for one class period everyone had to listen to KISS! Love Gun has a couple of my all time favorite Kiss songs, Love Gun (great vocals, great guitar) and Plaster Caster (simple song with cool vocals by Gene). Other klassics are Almost Human (cool lyrics), I Stole Your Love, and Christine Sixteen (solo by Eddie Van Halen I believe). Ace's Shock Me and Peter's Hooligan are good as is the cover of Then She Kissed Me. The two songs I could do without are Tomorrow & Tonight (rehash) and Got Love For Sale (weak and not catchy at all). Unfortunately the cd does not have the original cardboard \\"Love Gun\\" but it does contain some fine good-time rock!
B000002UVX|5.0|this album is the best live album ever, and it has the most amazing guitar playing of any album , live or not, ever... including jimi's other albums. This seems to be jimi's underground(it was the last one i heard about)and has a free kind of newness about it. i've never heard anyone cover any of these songs cause no-one can! Ive never heard a guitar sound more primal, organic and expressive.  <br />       <br />Listening to this album is a similar experience to listening to modern jazz like coltrane and miles davis etc, because 'pop' is out the window for one thing, coltrane etc trancended jazz into their own primal expression, just like hendrix does with popular rock. All the songs last at least 5 minutes with machine gun going up to over 12 minutes of inspired improvisation. <br />
0553212443|5.0|This was a wonderful surprise for me after having to put hard times down through boredom. It's about a hundred and thirty pages long with large gaps in between the lines so it took me about three or four hours to read it. Of course I've seen countless actors play Scrooge (George C. Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films. In fact I'm now aware of how much the films 'fleshed out' some of it.Also in the movies you can't get a lot of the Dickens humour which is sprinkled through the prose so it was a great choice for me and will be for you.
B00065U08Q|5.0|Many who listen to England's electronic art rockers Autechre, the ever-eccentric Bjork, or to Radiohead's more recent catalogue editions like \\"OK Computer,\\" \\"Kid A,\\" and \\"Amnesiac,\\" merely sit in awe of the intricate digital textures, rhythmic programming, inventive synthesizer manipulations, and the surrealistic atmospheres which they create.  Others, like Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante and his long-time friend, Josh Klinghoffer, are inspired to the point of imitation.  Luckily for us, they do it well. <br /> <br />Those expecting a disc chockfull of Frusciante guitar solos should look for one of the other six, yes six, solo albums the Chili Pepper string magician is putting out this calendar year.  \\"Sphere\\" is a highly electronic, synthesized, beat driven, heavily layered, and groove oriented album.  \\"Sphere\\" trades in the Chili Pepper sing-a-long offerings for atmospherically catchy rhythms and dance-inciting grooves. Yet, it still owns its share of melodic licks, and, an intoxicating two-minute Frusciante guitar run starting four and a half minutes into its first track to satisfy Chili Pepper fans salivating for such. <br /> <br />Frusciante and Klinghoffer weave beautiful vocal harmonies on the lazily paced and melodic \\"Surrogate People,\\" while the beautifully symphonic \\"At Your Enemies\\" sounds perfect for background for a Blue Man Group performance with its xylophone runs, helicopter like interjections, and captivating Klinghoffer vocals. <br /> <br />Klinghoffer takes the reigns in the highly atmospheric \\"Communique,\\" seemingly setting up his piano atop the windy Alps with Frusciante experimenting with his modular synthesizer a few steps behind. <br /> <br />Frusciante's raspy vocals shine in the dance provoking standout \\"Walls\\" as Klinghoffer's Thom Yorke-like undercutting backing vocals compliment brilliantly. <br /> <br />Infused with a groovy PJ Harvey-esque bassline and raspy Frusciante vocals, the catchy \\"Afterglow\\" is enough to make any rhythm-less person attempt what he or she should never: dance.     <br /> <br />The short and simple piano-led \\"My Life\\" is the only track that leaves anything to be desired, but still tugs at the `ol heart strings.   <br /> <br />This short yet magnificently eclectic EP is a welcome departure from the Chili Peppers' increasingly pop rock orientated releases and is a must for any music connoisseur who appreciates rich textures, heavily layered rhythms, captivating soundscapes, and well... good old- fashioned \\"boogeying.\\" <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Not to many artists or groups can come out with an album of substance that can attract and draw me in with first listen. Music with substance is something more, it's not that it isn't catchy, it's the fact that your brain needs that second listen to grasp on to the notes. You need to sit down, listen to - seriously listen to, analyze and figure why it is what it is. Muse on the other was different, it has a vibe, an aura around it that grabs you from inside and feeds your ears as well as your brain. <br />     <br />From the pounding piano on \\"Apocalypse Please\\" to the off time/on time vocals that follow, words can't describe what you're in for. The vocal technique is another one of the unique features of the album. The lead singer, Mathew Bellamy has a signature sound of a slight off tempo release with almost a croon/swoop stlye, and vibrato on most of his long tone releases. Other than the pounding of the first song, the lyrics fit perfectly with the mood of the song. It feels as if THE volcano is erupting, the sun is never coming back, and Satan has finally launched his war upon heaven and earth. If you closed your eyes and turn it up loud enough, the lyrics seem to come through as a prayer \\"It's time we saw a miracle, come on it's time for something biblical\\". The whole of the song haunts me from beginning to end, and almost puts me in fear and the hope that God will be rescuing us all. And now we're only through the first song. <br /> <br /> Skip through the lead single from the album and we find ourselves in \\"Sing for Absolution\\". Another song that haunts me through every lyric, a different sort of haunting, a different feeling, because I feel as if this is the poem my mind played over and over again with one of my former loves, a former love who didn't know where I stood. I could go through every song on this album and tell what each line of every song means to me and why this album has the haunting ability to speak my thoughts. Nay a word in the English language or a genre in music that can put the right classification on Muse.  <br />     <br />  Any music fan of any type can find some nook or cranny they will fall in love with. From the hard hitting, yet beautiful \\"Stolckholm Syndrom\\" to the classical piano breakdown in \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" that has the reminiscence of the romantic era superstar \\"Liszt\\". Finally tailing off with a similar Sigur Ros/Radiohead  sound, the album has gone from the first song that has a sign of life to last, death. It puts the perfect album in perspective, battle of life to death.  <br />    <br />  The highlight of the album is by far the musicianship and songwriting ability of portent lead singer/guitarist/pianist Mathew Bellamy. Hopefully my review has placed some sort of curiosity in your mind about wanting to at least check out a song, I highlighted a few songs in the review on purpose. This album may be put out on Warner Bros. Records but do not let the major label scare you away, this is the label that put out Less Than Jake's Anthem album, both of The Used's full lengths, Glassjaw's Worship and Tribute full length and the hair metal superstars The Darkness. While none of these bands come close to what Muse has accomplished, it will hopefully shed some light that Warner Bros may still care about music. <br />  <br />-Nate Matzelle
B00008K7AM|5.0|I enjoyed it; it's got great laffs. Adam Sandler's occasional appearances are fun. Director Tom Brady has made a film that has many levels of thought, a grotesque reimagining of Boys Don't Cry with a happy ending. Rob Schneider's energetic performance is to be commended; Anna Faris (Scream movies) has proven that she can handle fun comedy. This is not a film to be judged, but to be enjoyed. Those who take the time, will be rewarded. Some great messages for everyone.
0962477060|1.0|If you are learning the guitar, there is no silver bullet. Do yourself a favor, avoid this book and buy a copy of Leavitt's Modern Method for Guitar 1-3 and all three volumes of Praxis and study them for a few years. I've bought and read a lot of different guitar books, and this is one of the few that I've felt totally ripped off on. <br /> <br />This book doesn't really contain all that is new or not found in much better books that are out there. Probably the only interesting thing in the book is the discussion on the placement of the major third interval among the strings reducing the number of non-chord tones, which is on a single page. <br /> <br />The only other thing that it tries to contribute is information on how various chordal shapes interrelate to each other, but if you learn all of the triads and seventh chords in all inversions on all sets of strings and how to arpeggiate them into each other (which any good guitarist must do sooner or later), you'll implicitly get this information. <br />
B00005JLR2|4.0|\\"Mr. Arrow, I've checked this miserable barge from stem to stern and as always. . . it's spot-on. How do you do it?\\" <br /> - Captain Amelia <br /> <br />Treasure Planet, yet another adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate and hidden plunder epic, could have been a chance for another entry into Disney's growing catalog of lackluster animated flims. Fortunately, it's really very good family film from the directors of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid. <br /> <br />Putting an interplanetary spin on the treasure hunting tale was one of the best ideas in this film, and not only lends for some really interesting (and sometimes geniunely funn) twists on familiar story points and characters, but aslo for some geniunely spectacular scenery. The ships still resemble 17th century galleons, but are no retrofitted for space travel; plasma cannons and solar sails included. <br /> <br />Is it physically impossible? You betcha. Should you care? Not really. It's just too darn pretty. Like everything in this movie, the vehicles are imaginative, classy, and animated perfectly. The animation all around is some of the best offered from Disney, showing the late influences of anime as well as the more classic styles seen in movies decades old. And despite the near-schitzophrenic feel of some of the design-meldings, it all works beautifully on the screen. <br /> <br />The story is familiar, but some darker elements are added to freshen it up and give it some depth. Jim Hawkins (15) is a troubled youth with an absent father and a distressed mother. When a strange old pirate crashlands near his home with a cryptic warning and a map to a legendary treasure, it doesn't take much encouragement (in point of fact, it doesn't take any) for Jim to start his adventure. On board the RLS Legacy, he meets a suspicious motley crew, a high-strung feline captain, and John Silver, a cook and a cyborg who more than what he seems. <br /> <br />Jim's and Silver's relationship is played up in this version,and it's well-done. Silver is the substitute for Jim's father (who left 5 years previous), and the bond that forms between them is well-paced and believable. It's also strained during a mutiny, a frantic chase to Treasure Planet's surface, and a series of cat-and-mouse games involving the treasure map, the trove, and a thrilling escape. <br /> <br />Overall, Treasure Planet is really nothing terribly new, but it is very good. The care that was put into the art design, the touching up of the story, and the spot-on voice performances is evident in every scene, and through and through, the themes of family, never giving up, and bravery are relayed with pronouncement without every getting preachy. And there are parts that are just plain hilarious. <br /> <br />The extras on the DVD are better than usual for Disney. Along with a good and informative visual commentary track are deleted scenes, behind-the scenes looks at animation, and a few games for the kids. A music video and a great 1:85:1 transfer round out the package, making for a respectable DVD to go with a overlooked but highly entertaining film.
0790729369|5.0|130 reviews says it all about this beautiful classic - it affects everyone that sees the movie or reads the story. (I prefer the book but Hollywood did well with it. 171 pages and it took me three days to read. That's a lot of Kleenix!) <br />Personally, I was single in my forties and met these people and witnessed this slice of life. It happens! Waller does an absolutely fabulous job of capturing the feelings of confusion, awe, wonder and love that totally engulf when \\"chemistry\\" takes over. No one can plan to make this happen! Affairs are about sex. This story is about love - a one time only love.
B000021YQV|5.0|Ok, I've gotta be opinionated here. This is one of the best CDs ever made. <br /> <br />Listening to it for the first time was a little strange. Among other quirky lyrics and seemingly out-of-place riffs (\\"Chop Suey!\\"), the misleading start to \\"Prison Song\\" threw me off a bit, but it soon became second nature as I listened to it more and more. The hard, powerful, metallic riffs will have you headbanging like there's no tomorrow, and combined with Serj Tankian's lyrics and compelling vocals (ranging from a throaty growl to a softer yet still amazing tone) you'll be hooked and there'll be no getting this CD out of your stereo. Tankian and Malarkian work so well together, and it shows in their harmonies, frequently utilized throughout the CD. <br /> <br />As far as the individual songs go, they can range from deeply allegorical to brutally blatant in their point. Take, for example, \\"Needles\\" or \\"Bounce\\" (the first sings about a tapeworm but is about drug abuse, and the second seems to be about nothing more than a pogo stick when it's actually about an orgy)... and then you listen to such songs as \\"Prison Song\\", where Tankian literally screams data to the background guitar. The songs tend to be somewhat confusing and random in their techniques: take \\"Chop Suey!\\"'s rapidly switching piano and guitar, and \\"ATWA\\"'s slow start and heavy finish. The band members' Armenian descent gives a quirky twist to the music, with the haunting vocal patterns and the unique guitar tunes. Finally, the pattern is perfect, with the heavier songs at the beginning carrying you up, and letting you down slowly with the brilliant title song, and to end, the more mellow yet deeply satisfying \\"Aerials\\". <br /> <br />To sum it all up, if you're looking for top-notch metal that's just a little bit different from the rest of the crowd, this CD is definitely for you. Two thumbs way up!
B0006399FS|1.0|This is the worst side of U2, by Far. Cynical, lack of honesty, liar, cheap, recyled, commercial, avaricious... comfortably numb    THEY'VE BECOME COMFORTABLY NUMB    Overall this boring soup is for iPod commercials and grammy awards, not for die hard fans like me.  They have settle down in the world of the commercialization, supported by easy teens fans.  Some fans dont mind about Bonos performance. He cant sing anymore, he doesnt have a half a voice he had in the 80s. And still some fans believe that fake words \\"80s U2 is back\\", \\"They returned to the basic sound\\" and blah blah.    LOVE IS BLINDNESS... dont you remember ? do you ?    They didnt make an album here, they only cloned All That You Cant Leave Behind... is that \\"THE BEST U2 ALBUM\\" ?... come on, were not stupid !!    I prefer 1000 times to donate money for Africa AIDS rather than buy this nastiness.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|The first half of this cd is great, I have no idea what happened after track 6.  My favourite track is \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\".  I had no idea Pink could sing like that.  She should stick to the r and b ballads, that's where she shines the most.  I also like \\"love song\\", but then Pink gets all neurotic and angry and turns it into a hate song about a hooker mf. uh ......yeah, u go Pink uh huh.  Minus the forgetable tracks, it's still a pretty good cd.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Ben Affleck turns in a brooding performance as \\"Daredevil,\\" a blind hero that is attorney by day; judge, jury and executioner by night.  Typical of comic book yarn, father, giftedly played by David Keith, is murdered.  Young son Matt is left alone, blind, and vengeful.  He uses his other senses to \\"see\\" with sound vibrations.  He becomes skilled in martial arts and acrobatics.  Suprisingly believable.  I enjoyed the PG13 version, but felt this version is much tighter and darker.  There is a whole scenerio involving Coolio that got cut originally, and felt it added to the story.  I do feel that Kingpin, brilliantly done by Michael Clarke Duncon, was underused and was worthy of having the villainous role all to his own.  Bullseye, played smartassy by Colin Farrell could have been a chief villain as well instead as a supporting player.  Electra was in the film far too short, but will be spun off to her own movie.  On a side note I was a little disappointed that there was no \\"Electra\\" trailer considering the film comes out in January.  It would have been nice to include a free pass for it too.  After all Fox, we did buy this film a second time.  All in all though the sound is great, the new scenes are added seemlessly.  It is well worth owning both versions.
B000009RC2|5.0|In 1970-71 I was playing in various no-account rock bands, touring the east coast USA, and felt like I was slowly choking my soul playing covers in bars full of drunks.  <br /> <br />I finally had had enough and called it quits the summer of '71, and went back to school at age 21. I missed playing music something fierce, but couldn't really find any reason to get back into the rock scene. At the same time although I listened to mainstream and post-bop jazz and liked it, I  had no desire to play it, being hooked on the power of rock volume and rhythms. <br /> <br />My girlfriend's father at the time was a DJ in New Jersey and every month or so he'd send down a big stack of promo LPs he'd received but wasn't interested in spinning. In fall of 71, one of his discarded promo LPs was Inner Mounting Flame. <br /> <br />I was vaguely aware of McLaughlin from Miles' Bitches Brew, but hadn't been that impressed either with BB or with McL's playing on BB (I've since grown to like BB but am still lukewarm on the McL's gtr on that album). <br /> <br />From the very first listen, Inner Mounting Flame completely changed the way I heard music. No one called it 'fusion' at the time and I didn't really think of it as a fusion between jazz and rock. It just seems like a completely new musical form, with a very deep soul. <br /> <br />I saw Mahavishnu play live five times that year and the next. I started playing music again, too, and have never stopped playing  since Inner Mounting Flame demonstrated the direction I needed to go. Looking back it was obvious the whole world needed a new way to go, bored by the subtleties of post-bop and the dumbness of hard rock.  <br /> <br />Mahavishnu's subsequent releases never equalled the beauty of IMF, at least for me. The closest anyone else has come is the late Shawn Lane with Jonas Hellborg.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek: Nemesis is one terrific movie! I'm a big NextGen fan, and I was verrry disappointed with their last outing (Insurrection was totally lame). What a turnaround!    Just the fact that Riker and Troi are married is enough to push this one up to the top, but there is so much more. With the exception of the early dune buggy scene the script is top-notch, the battle scenes are stunning, there's a bit of that Star Trek humor (but without being hokey), and the Nemesis surpasses the Borg Queen as the best of the Trek villains.    Tom Hardy's Shinzon is a multi-layered personality, and Hardy plays him with a subtle intensity and a great sarcastic edge. He gives us a villain that is both menacing and pitiable -- not an easy task to pull off.     I hope this isn't the last of the Next Generation films, but if it is, they've gone out with one to be proud of!! Don't miss it.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />It's really sad, but it's true: Mick Jagger, 17 years older than Bono, looks and sounds younger and better than Bono. Bono sounds terrible here, I don't know how the hell he thinks \\"I like the sound of my own voice\\" WHAT A CRAP IS BONO'VOICE !!! ( sorry for my words, but it's the whole truth ).  <br /> <br />Mick jagger has had 30 times sex, cigarettes and alcohol that Bono, without forgetting Mick's drugs, and nevertheless he shines, looks and sings far better that this retired Bono, who doesn't have a voice in this album. Bono looks old, fat and tired with his stupid long hair and his unnecessary sunglasess. <br /> <br />It's a pity what some fans are doing desperately. New Kids On The Block were number one in USA, as well Backstreet Boys, Spice Girls and all those kids bands...so that doesn't mean quality at all. Equally, sure this album will have 5 or 6 grammy... who really cares about that ? <br /> <br />Melodies are really poor here. Except for City Of Blinding Lights, forget the rest. This is probably the U2's most heavily hyped album ever, for the same reason many fans really hate it !!, because behind that big hyped wall, they found a safe, commercial, unnecessary, clumsy, ridiculous, false, boring, worn away, predictable, cliche, unimaginative, greed and cheap album, dominated by rough and wrongly \\"emotional\\" Bono's voice and the same Edge's signature. Where are Adam and Larry here ?. <br /> <br />I still think this is the worst U2 decade by far, dominated by reams of pre-album publicity, Bono getting older, boring and worse, The group's ubiquitous TV commercials for Apple and the special-issue iPod, Adoration to U.S flag any U.S policy ( no matter what's happening around the world this time ) immediatly after September 11, etc, etc <br /> <br />U2 has become a ferocious joke of themselves, being called by many fans as \\"the new fat Elvis\\". <br /> <br />Any honest U2 fan can't say \\"it's their best\\" because that's pure fake. Pretending to love this album by giving 5 stars and saying \\"IS THE BEST U2 ALBUM SINCE ACHTUNG BABY !!!\\" doesn't mean that the album appears better of which is, all the opposite, just increases to the displeasure and the wrath to this plastic product for iPod. <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|1.0|The opening 30 minutes of this film lost me entirely. Having to listen to a long sophomoric dialogue between this singularly uninteresting, inarticulate and really quite uncouth couple was for me intolerable. Ethan Hawke's character is the sort of fellow I dread to have sitting next to me in a restaurant or on a long plane ride - so full of himself and yet so deeply empty!  The threat of these two as probable lovers in the remainder of the movie was more than I could take - I freely admit that I switched it off, enough was enough.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|i listen to all types of music, and by that i mean ALL STYLES (from Venezuelan Joropo, to Motown, Country, Mongolian Throat-singers, all types of Jazz, Pop, Hard Rock, etc.) and it is my opinion that, although combining disparate styles may seem like a great idea, more often than not it turns out sounding awful. in this case, however, bebo valdes and diego cigala have come up with unique interpretations of old songs, combining the flamenco style of singing with jazzy and latin piano accompaniment (hints of tango) that sound and feel more authentic and definitive, more profound and timeless, than the thousands of versions that have been recorded through the ages. whether or not you are listening intently to what they are doing -- you could be blasting it in a dark room or just playing it in the background during a dinner party -- it envelopes and transports you with its deep beauty. i simply can not believe how perfect this music is.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is an utter surprise.  The action scenes are breathtaking and genuinely original.  The practice of Gun Kata, although patently rediculous in real life, was fascinating and fun to watch. <br /> <br />The Orwellian plot was interesting and kept the film tight.  This film is something you don't see often... a good action movie. Similar in originality to the Matrix but not remotely the same film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah's past CD's were awesome, with catchy tunes and music. But I have to admit the past CD's don't compare to this one. Now I'll admit I prefer her other CD's over this one, but I will recognize the fact that the lyrics she chooses in this CD are so powerful. She does a compelling job at calling a spade a spade.<br /><br />  Listing to this CD, I feel like it's not Sarah singing, but me singing to me. This CD is very special because one can use it in reflection. When listing, you may find yourself seeing things you usually forget.<br /><br />  To see Sarah write songs about these types of issues, in my opinion is a very mature thing to do. She's singing from her heart, and with passion. It's very clear through her music. You not only get to see a piece of her, but also a piece of yourself.<br /><br />  Once again, if you're buying the CD for the tunes, then you might reconsider. It's an amazing album, but there are probably more desired CD's out there that you would want to buy first.
B0006399FS|3.0|...but not as good as \\"All That You Leave Behind\\". This sound harks back to \\"The Joshua Tree\\" in spots. Nothing on this cd grabbed me like \\"Elevation\\" and \\"Walk On\\" did from the previous cd. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" is the closest. \\"Vertigo\\" is the hardest rocking song here. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is another great song. You can't go wrong with U2 though, and even a so-so U2 album is light years better than most of the crap thats out there today. Nice to see a rock album at the top of the charts again.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Synopsis: Matt Damon returns as amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne in this fast-paced follow-up to THE BOURNE IDENTITY. Forced out of hiding as the result of an attempt on his life, Bourne fulfills his earlier promise to wreak vengeance on his former CIA employers, some of whom may be in league with murderous Russians. Brian Cox and Joan Allen are both great as warring agency chiefs convinced Bourne orchestrated the murder of two of their own in a deal gone bad. Thanks to tense, gritty direction by Paul Greengrass the plot stays tight, the characters believable, and suspense and thrills flow steady. Franka Potente and Julia Stiles are back from the original, and the always dependable Marton Csokas shows up as one of Bourne's deadly fellow operatives. A rousing car chase through Moscow may outdo the ones in RONIN and THE FRENCH CONNECTION for visceral speed and length. As the icing on the cake, John Powell provides a menacing, ambient percussive score. I personally have not cared for Matt Damon past movies or movie roles, but found his Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy to be his best choices of roles yet. [...]Good recommendation if I say so myself....Thanks!!
B00065JTBA|5.0|I love all of Bon Jovi's work.  They are the best band in the world.  This is the ultimate fans dream come true.  You have 4 cds packed with previously unreleased material plus the bonus dvd.  You also get the privilege of hearing Tico and David sing. Not sure which ones are my favorites yet, but I find myself singing to the catchy tunes like \\"Why aren't you dead?\\" and \\"Rich Man living in a poor man's house.\\" Can't wait for the next tour.
0783225857|5.0|I show this movie in its entirety to my business classes. I wheel it out when we deal with 'leadership' and the need to be willing to stand up for certain principles. We all won't be given the chance Attorney Atticus Finch is given to defend Tom Robinson 70 years after slavery ended in segregationist Alabama, but Gregory Peck in the defining role of his career points us in the right direction.<br /><br />That it is a 45 year old film doesn't really matter. The ideas are timeless. Atticus says to his son upon being asked why he took the Tom Robinson case, 'because I couldn't hold my head up if I said no.'<br /><br />Timeless stuff. Great family film. Pretty good for teenagers too if you can tie them down. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00005J9M1|1.0|This is NOT (Very+)!!!!  It is Bilingual.  Amazon has been informed of this (over a month ago) and has not fixed the entry.

B0000JCFPE|2.0|Basically, I think this movie is fairly offensive. I don't mean the sex. Good grief. At this point who cares? We've had actors grunting and groaning since the 70's. I think we're used to it.<br /><br />What's shocking isn't the nudity or gymnastic sex (\\"I think she stuck that one, Brad\\"). What's shocking is the lack of any humanity. I mean its so mean spirited. Let me give you an example. I recently saw and reviewed \\"Unfaithful.\\" Those people had feelings. They were confused. But there was love, sometimes impeded love, love with obstacles in the way. Sometimes misdirected love. But the folks, kids, husbands, wives all had some heart. I mean they cooked dinner for eachother.<br /><br />Here, Douglas and Stone were . . . heartless. The picture was regarded as a powerful statement of the 90's. What powerful statement? That some women don't wear [...]? How did we get along without this information? Or did we know it and it really didn't mean that much?<br /><br />To quote the bard, 'much ado about nothing.' It's kind of like the 'emperors clothes.' A whole bunch of people say 'This is a really great movie.\\" Who's saying that? It's [...] that got by without the X rating. Does that make it bad? Not necessarily. Just call it what it is. What it's not is art. 2 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B0002SROT0|2.0|this album is pretty stinky.  i wish it was never put out.  just makes me think about how if he were still alive, how each album would be cruddier than the last.  figure 8 stinks too, XO is so-so.  everything before that is cool.  and all heatmiser albums suck too.  and, yes, i do know what i'm talking about.
B00005NKK8|5.0|When \\"Forrest Gump\\" first hit theaters, it was an instant hit - thanks to brilliant acting, a heartwarming tale, and classic music to back it up. Finding the right tunes to play as a backdrop to more than three decades of American history is quite a daunting task, but those who assembled this collection of songs rose to the challenge, creating a truly American soundtrack. <br /> <br />The best of the best are here, with American artists giving a true representation of what the world was like in Forrest Gump's time. From the first time young Forrest saw Elvis gyrate (`Hound Dog') to his shrimping expeditions (`Sloop John B'), each song has been chosen for its sentimental value and classic addition to the film. This is a brilliant collection, with great hits from Bob Seger, the Mamas and Papas, Beach Boys, Byrds, Simon & Garfunkel, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac, and so many more. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great collection of American music, look no further. This two-disc set is an excellent addition to any music fan's collection. And if you're new to this era of music, it provides a great sampling of one of the greatest music generations ever.  <br />
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I was fortunate to have attended the June 6 concert with my son.  It was a phenomenal experience.  The DVD is pretty good.  The performances included on the DVD are all good.  I would have just a few comments.  Jeff Beck, Pat Methany, Neal Schon, and Clapton's performances of Layla and Wonderful Tonight are not included.  These were also great, especially Layla.  Also, some of the commentary between numbers overlaps onto the next performance (specifically Robert Lockwood's).  I think the DVD is very good but could have included more.  The first disc is only about 93 minutes--another 30 to 60 minutes could easily have been added.  Those who attended would probably have preferred a \\"box set\\" with every performance included.  This said, if you like these artists, the DVD is a must have.
B000002MY3|4.0|When Alanis Morissette emerged with debut album \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in 1995, the world quickly sat up and took notice. This was the pre-Lillith Fair era, when women weren't supposed to make a scene in music. And then there was Alanis - combining harmonicas, catchy melodies, and nearly screaming lyrics that we couldn't get out of our heads. It was addictive, and, nearly a decade later, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" sounds as innovative as it did when it was first released. <br /> <br />Few debut records have scored so many radio hits - five - and few songstresses have made as huge an impact as Morissette. Whether she's laughing at bad luck (`Ironic'), venting anger at an ex (`You Oughta Know'), or thanking someone for support (`Head over Feet'), she's always pop-friendly enough for you to sing along. Watch out though - upon closer inspection, some of the lyrics (especially the Church-bashing `Forgiven') can be offensive. If that doesn't bother you, fine, but if it does, consider yourself warned. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best word to describe this album is raw - full of emotion, with lyrics that cut to the core and a singing style that, at points, nearly resembles tearing flesh. It's loud, crass, and not for those who don't want a little attitude in their music. At once provocative and fascinating, it is a truly well-written record that has stood up to the test of time.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Firstly, I'll give you my \\"to the point\\" review. \\"lamb of god\\" is yet another in a long line of bands that have not only brought metal music back into the realm of REAL music genres instead of some kind of \\"fad/regional/low-fan base\\" genre of music; but have done so in the tradition(s) of the great ones (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, etc.). This CD carries on where \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" left off (if it left anything undone indeed), and is worth every bit of money you spend on it. If you are into VERY heavy music that makes both political points as well as \\"sheer-headbanging for the sake of\\" metal, buy this.<br /><br />That having been said, I would like to make a bit of a statement and then shut the f*ck up. If you like a CD, then say so, with a bit of why that particular CD/Band wails on you like it does. If you don't like a CD? Again, say so and state why. But comparing bands, saying this band sounds like this band, saying that this band IS Metal, or this band ISN'T metal? That, while a matter of opinion, has WAY too many variables to it for you to make that particular judgement. How about something more along the lines of  \\"This CD wasn't heavy enough for me\\" rather than \\"This band isn't Metal\\" or \\"This band sounds like this band\\" type comments. Those last two comments are just the kind of sh*t that keeps not only Metalheads but Metal BANDS from being able to stay true to their styles AND actually being able to at least PAY THE RENT with their craft, get me? All this sh*t about \\"selling out\\" and crap like that is what kept Metal videos and shows off the air for almost a decade, which meant that bands had to work 2 or 3 jobs AND then try to put on a killer show with 2 hours sleep.<br /><br />Regardless, this again is just an opinion, but one I hadn't seen yet so I thought I'd put it up for the sake of all Metalheads, Rivetdogs, Steelbashers, and everyone else who goes beyond just \\"listening\\" to Heavy (generic enough?), but actually lives their lives that way, to the HILT!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Joseph Ellis, to the HILT!    Cheers,  Joseph Ellis
B00007CVSH|5.0|I owned this dvd for year and a half, and, considering that this is a very \\"popular\\" opera, this version is, after all this time, giving me the same pleasure as when i just got it.<br />First, because of the cast: Cura and Villaroel were known to me because of Verdi's Otello (Turin, 1997). Hvorostovsky was unknown, as well as Ivonne Naef.<br /><br />My biggest surprise and satisfaction was Hvorostovsky's Count Di Luna, one of my favorite roles among the verdian baritones (just after Macbeth, of course). He is such a great actor, getting into his roles with passion and discipline (coming from the russian school, no wonder he's like that...) His voice is a delight.<br /><br />Then, Cura and Villaroel gave me the same impression i expected: Plenty knowledge about their roles and intentions, and giving great acting when the \\"peaks\\" of the drama need to be enforced to enrich the play. Not to mention the voices, dramatic and strong, just as i expect in this characters.<br /><br />Moshinsky's point of view of this opera is very good. I just admire his work here, and in other works like Samson et Dalila or Nabucco (Productions i hope i'll see very soon).<br /><br />Carlo Rizzi, after this Trovatore, and other operas i heard from him, is becoming my favorite verdian director. You can feel his compenetration with the music and the story. The Royal opera orchestra is splendid as always.<br /><br />There is some bonus material here, a docummentary about the cast, some facts about the fighting sequence, and the synopsis. That's a plus in the BBC recordings: We can find supporting material for what we are about to see. For me is important to have some information about the direction and conception of the opera. Good for it.<br /><br />That's why i recommend this dvd, the cast is first rate, the production is awesome and, by the way, is the latest from Covent Garden and Real de Madrid. The sound is great and the image very clear as well.<br /><br />5 stars!
B0002KQNJU|4.0|I think it is good to know that the DVD has also the German and the Italian audio track, not only English and French. I was very pleased. Thank you!- But why did't they give that information on the cover? <br />
B00005O5CM|1.0|FYI:  Anyone purchasing this thinking their getting the SE version think again.  With the lower price MGM stripped the flip side of this disc that contained the special features (ie, deleted scenes, featurettes, Hoku's \\"Perfect Day\\" video, etc...).  All features except commentaries are gone. <br /> <br />What bums me out is that MGM didn't even change the UPC code on the DVD from the original version.  Personally, I think this is a shoddy business practice.  You won't know what you're getting until it arrives at your door. <br /> <br />The movie itself is great fun.  I'd give it 4 stars.  But skip this version unless you have it in your hands and it states on the box it's the special edition (there are still some floating around).
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I just bought this CD and it is too awesome for words.  I was a little sceptical, though I do like his hit \\"I don't wanna be.\\"  After listening to the CD just once, I couldn't stop!  It is a great CD to listen to while relaxing, studying, or in the car. <br /> <br />My favorite songs: <br />1) Belief - this song is BEAUTIFUL  (11/10) <br />2) More than anyone - great song also (10/10) <br />3) Follow through - a good break up song (9/10) <br />4) Just friends - awesome song about seeing that old love (9/10) <br />5) Anyway - great acoustics (9/10) <br />6) Chemical party - funny song (8/10) <br />
B0002Y69NG|3.0|With the horde of DVD double dipping of late, it was pretty much a forgone conclusion that some kind of deluxe package for the Matrix trilogy would be made, especially considering the extras on the single disc edition of the first film and the fluff filled extras of the two disc sequels.  Now, Warner Bros. is issuing this massive, 10 disc set, compiling the Matrix trilogy, the Animatrix, the original Matrix Revisited, and a horde of new extras.  Is it worth shelling out the money for?  The answer entirely depends on the consumer.  Those who enjoyed the visionary first film of the series but felt burned by the inferior sequels will want to leave this in the dust, but for the Matrix freaks out there, this is a must own.  For what you get the price isn't too steep, and the extras are more worthwhile watching than any extras on the previous releases, but for the casual fan who has already shelled out the cash for the single releases, this isn't entirely worth owning.  Also, once again, there is no commentaries at all by creators Andy and Larry Wachowski.  Instead, there are commentary tracks by philosophers (read, hardcore fans making the Matrix into metaphysics) and critics alike.  This is a smart move on the part of the brothers, but just about anyone else knows that the two are too busy counting their money to care.  That aside, if you are one of the very few who don't own any of the film's on DVD and are a Matrix fan, then this is worth picking up, but for others, just like the theme of the films, the choice is entirely up to you.
B00000K0DV|5.0|If you're looking for academy award-winning performances in this film, you need help...If you're looking to see something shocking, you're in luck.<br /><br />The first time I saw this flick, I had to close my eyes in several parts-it is that gory.  Some of the things Fulci shows in detail in this movie have never and probably will never be shown again in popular film.<br /><br />In short, there is not much plot...a duck-quacking loony is slashing women.  But if you love horror, this one is well worth seeing for sure.  Just make sure there is no one home that could possibly be offended...because if they walk in while you're watching this, I guarantee you they'll be offended.
B00006879E|5.0|I have read through all of the reviws here, and was appalled!!! <br /> <br />I love this band and their \\"mediocre\\" lyrics as some would say!! <br /> <br />I believe also that if you listen enough to the lyrics, you will hear the message they are sending. I have been in a  relationship quite like the one Adam Levine is singing about, so I relate 100%. <br /> <br />As for the most horrible band on the planet, I have heard some of the most GOD AWFUL singers and bands, enough to last me a lifetime, and Maroon 5 is not one of them. I will, however compare Maroon 5 with Hanson. For their vision, lyrics, and music skills. You all may not agree, but that is just my honest opinion. <br /> <br />I do understand the problem with a music station playing a song 5 times in one hour. I hate that, but that is the caller's, not them. But of course, they don't have to play it. But then they would not get any listeners that way! <br /> <br />I did not particularly care for the video either, but not everyone can be Michael Jackson in \\"Thriller.\\" <br /> <br />I will say this...Maroon 5 rocks, and they rock hard, at least to me!! <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|I have been listening to Pearl Jam since Live on Two Legs.  I heard their songs on the radio, but never bothered to pick up any of their albums.  A friend I was working w/ at the time brought in Live on Two Legs one day and after that, I was hooked.  I couldn't believe how much energy these guys release through their music.  I went out and bought some used copies of Ten and VS and realized what I missed during the early 90's.  I proceeded to purchase all of their other albums and attend every concert that has been in my area.  This album is great for starters, as it is in chronological order.  You get to see how they matured as a band (even though I enjoy their earlier music more).  If you like this album, go try to pick up some live bootlegs or the Touring Band 2000 DVD.  You haven't experienced PJ until you see/hear them live.
0920668372|3.0|This story was about a mother that rocks and sings to her son during his life span.  The mom would sing, \\"I'll love you forever/ I'll like you for always/ As long as I'm living/ my baby you'll be.\\"  The mom would crawl across the floor and look at her son at night.  If she found him asleep, she would rock him and sing to him.  She grew old.  In the end, the son held the mom to sing and rock her.         <br />   <br />I found this story strange and yet emotional.  I felt it was strange for a mom to pick up a grown man while sleeping.  It is humanly impossible.  I also thought it was strange for a mom to take a ladder to her son's house to crawl through a window to rock and sing to him.  I felt emotional when the son held his old mom and sang to her.     <br /> <br />
0385513755|4.0|Say what you will about Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"---formulaic, undeveloped characterizations, stereotypical fanatics ---- this novel refeaturing Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon from \\"Angels and Demons\\" moves at a quick pace making it the perfect 24-hour read.  Agreed, this is not a literary masterpiece filled with innuendo and angst making the big statement about humanity in the 21st century.  But, it does intrigue with its snipets of information, some commonplace, some obscure regarding topics of a wide-ranging spectrum.  I admit to wondering what adventure Langdon will get up to in the next installment --- hopefully Brown has not quite made enough money on this novel's record sales to retire nicely in a villa that resembles a mini Versailles.<br /><br />In this edition, Brown includes some wonderful full color facsimiles of the art, architecture and historical personages mentioned in the novel, adding that old \\"one picture is worth a thousand words\\" extra that piques the reader's interest just that much more. Instead of saving you moments of search time on the web, the tantalizing images reproduced in this book will motivate you to find out more.  The edition includes the original text of the novel liberally intersperced with photos and reprints all printed on lovely artbook stock.  A wonderful holiday gift for the conspiracy theorist in your family.
0321127420|3.0|I read this the first week it came out and was suprised by how much it rehashed GOF and the Core J2EE patterns books; however I have referred back to it on \\"Unit of Work\\" and a couple other concepts that it helped to differentiate.  TO it's credit it consolidated information from several bodies of knowledge in patterns, and it provided c# examples in many cases, thereby being the first high profile work that really exposed MS developers to a world of patterns, that was arguably previously unknown.  Besides being somewhat lacking in originality, the other problems were the fact it actually catalogued anti-patterns as patterns (e.g. transaction script is basically unmaintainable web pages), and it addressed enterprise system architecture without paying any mind to integration concerns (see Hohpe for an excellent treatment of this subject); I'm not sure the two really are separable when we start talking about business services.  The best thing about this book is that it emphasizes the criticality of rich domain models in complex systems, which IMHO is a core design principle which is currently being eroded by a current of irrational and marketing-drunk SOA furor ... which reminds me, Domain Driven Design is not to be missed, it's simply an inspired work which helps to make Fowler's domain model achievable for almost anyone.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|The day I heard the CD was coming out, I made a note of it on my caledar and eagerly awaited the release. When I bought it I realized it was different from her other releases, but it was still remarkable nonetheless. The lyrics are beatiful, and although very soft and benign they are soothing and are a great thing to transcend into and not bump to. Celine relased an album that toned down her chest-thumping, bumping, drums crescendos. I for one prefer her other songs and her other materal that elevates her soaring vocals. In fact, when In Some Small Way comes and she belts out the chorus, I was ecstatic. Celine can't refrain from that because her fans demand it.  <br /> Saying that, purchase this album for yourself and see what you think. Hear it a few times and and you'll be having it on your CD player all night long. And for the next single, I hope it's In Some Small Way.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Oh wait hang on hang on... i thought that to be seen as a talented artist worthy of such publicuty you had to a) write you own lyrics, b)write you own music and, c) actualy be able to hold a note. Lyrics like \\"did ya think i was gonna give it up to you.\\", what oh you mean your virginity? well why the hell would i want some chick with the body of a 10 year old. Get over yourself girl. Plus lay off the drugs everytime your on tv your like completely spaced out. Whats with all the swearing? You dont swear on any of your cds. Is it cus it upsets your mommy. Posers like this make me sick. Buy this cd for your 10 year old daughter. Anyone who enjoys this music over that age must be mentally retarded.
B00064MW6A|3.0|This movie was ok. Kid enjoyed it, but overall I thought and expected more. She was too much. It had it's moments but her fights were just too unrealistic. She posed entirely too much and was too hung up on herself. Yeah she was catwoman but come on she had to stop and pose like a model 20 times during each scene. THis is a movie that after viewing once, you had enough. I give it a C-.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is the absolute best CD I have ever heard.  It takes you to a magical place the minute you press play.  All of the artist on the CD go all out and give their best performance.  Ray Charles was an amazing musician and man.  All hats off to him.
B0000542DH|5.0|Can i just say this movie is excellent!!. Everybody thinks it just evolves around violence but their is the whole issue of the love relationship that Mickey and Malory have.yes it does glorify violence to a certain exsistant but it make good viewing,Also just one last thing i think the animation and real movie work well together as it draws imagination to your eyes of what the characters are like and how they interact within their environment. <br />This movie is well worth the watch and money EXCELLENT <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|this is one of those movies that after you watch it, you and everyone you know who has seen it will repeatedly quote. Napoleon is just that character that you absolutely love. The movie is a little odd, and sometimes slow, but its absolute randomness will keep you in stiches from front to back...if you like random humor (think Office Space) if you don't like random humor...then don't come anywhere near this movie, you'll hate it.
0393317552|5.0|I'm not sure what all the controversy is when it comes to this book.  Diamond is not trying to eliminate any human cultural or technological factors when trying to understand why some nations produce \\"cargo\\" and others do not.  He freely acknowledges them, but keeps taking it one step deeper to try and find the ultimate underlying factor.  His answer?  FOOD PRODUCTION. <br /> <br />Nearly the entire waking existence of early man was spent in search of his/her next meal.  Only through means of improved food production (either through domestication of animals, deliberate farming, or both) was the surplus created that allowed for man's energy to be spent on any other endeavor. <br /> <br />The result of this \\"ultimate cause\\" allowed for the creation of \\"proximate causes\\" that allow certain nations to dominate others.  Central governments, population density, immunity to disease, artisan classes, traditions of learning, technological innovation, etc. <br /> <br />It appears much of the backlash against this book is due to Diamond's argument that only certain geographies had in place the natural resources and climate to develop the means for significant food production.  However, this is a vastly different argument than the misinterpretation that geography was the key to cultural and political ascendancy.  The point is food production, not geography! <br /> <br />As a student of history (through formal training, not as a hobby), to me this book we enlightening.  \\"History\\" has a starting point, and it is well into the autumn of man's existence.  Peering back in time into prehistory is, by definition, impossible through historiographical methods.  Diamond's multidisciplined approach is refreshing for any student of history who feels there is just more out there to learn.  If anyone was a fan of Keegan's \\"A History of Warfare\\" in that it borrowed anthropological knowledge to better understand the origins of warfare, Diamond provides similar service in that he uses biology and geography to better understand the origins of mans ability to do more than worry about his next meal. <br /> <br />The evidence is compelling.  There simply were certain parts of the globe that could not develop means of significant food production in isolation.  Those that could enjoyed a multi-millennia head start on developing the \\"proximate causes\\" of political/economic domination.  The contenders therefore came from specific geographies--why among the contenders some came to dominate the others is still left for interpretation.
B0002Y69LI|5.0|This is an outstanding film. The cinematography is certainly some of the finest I have ever seen - smooth, colourful and elegant. The story is moving, passionate and artful, loaded with metaphor. Story and character had an eloquent balance that kept me fully enganged right to the end. A complete work of art and in my top ten.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|I have been waiting to see this film ever since I saw the theatrical previews.  I had hoped that this film along with TWISTER (1996) would help bring back the all-star disaster films genre.  Well, I guess it has at that.  The Poseidon Adventure (1972) is being remade with a new cast for 2006 release.  Television movies, \\"10.5 (NBC 2004) and Catagory 6: Day of Destruction (CBS 2004) have been ratings busters.    In this film, the weather becomes very extreme.  If you want to be surprised, do not read any further.    You have got ice breaking off the size of Rhode Island.  70 miles an hour winds in Lancaster and Palmdale, Califronia and  football size hail.  Followed by tornadoes in Hollywood and Los Angeles, California.  Heavy lightning and upground flooding in New York City and a hurricane forming above land.  Due to the melting ice, the Atlantic ocean has a tidal wave as high as the Statue of Liberty's chest.  Like a tsunami, it hits New York City.  Then New York City is hit by the Great Blizzard.  it is the effect of Global Warming and the hole in the ozone.    Ross King make an appearance.    DVD includes deleted scenes, two different audio commentaries, interactive audio demo where you control what sound effects you here.    Individually on DVD, available in Widescreen and Full Screen.

B00005JMAH|5.0|I love this movie, I loved the book and I think the movie was done brilliantly.  My two year old daughter wants to watch this one along with the other two Harry Potter's every morning.  This movie has everything a good movie needs, suspense, scariness, heart warming moments and of course the action we expect out of Harry Potter, I would recommend it to anyone and I could watch it a hundred times more and still LOVE IT!

0385508417|2.0|what was grisham thinking?  this book is at best mildly amusing.  surely we have all thought of skipping christmas at one time or another; how could such an accomplished author have written such a shallow version of the idea?  he doesn't need the money, i am sure.<br /><br />so, i am left with wondering, what on earth was the purpose of this book?
0385508417|2.0|I was at my girlfriends house when her mom asked me if I had seen \\"Christmas with The Kranks\\" and I replied I had no desire to see it. She said she had the book and didn't think it looked like the movie was going to be anything like it. So I was bored and sat down with the book. Within a couple hours I had finished it and it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />The problem with the book is simply the basic storyline has a message that doesn't exactly feel right to me. Here is what I got. If you want to skip Christmas you are strange and the entire neighborhood will look down on you. In the last minute you have to rush and get everything ready and the neighborhood is more than happy to help. I get the feeling that Grisham thought \\"Oh, that will show the holiday spirit, if everyone pitches in to help.\\" But the neighboorhood only helps when the Kranks give in to the consumer version of Christmas.<br /><br />When they want to spend the holidays in the Carribean and relax in the sun and not worry about Christmas, they are looked down upon. Only until they must buy everything in a rush are they considered normal? That doesn't sound like a very good christmas message to me.<br /><br />The book was funny in parts but it sure takes awhile to get going. The first 30 pages or so are really drawn out and boring. Consider that Grisham spends 3-5 pages in the beginning with them going to the store and Luther not being able to find some chocolate. It has nothing to do with the story but it takes up a good amount of space. That is a mistake new writers make, not seasoned ones like Grisham. Maybe he had to add some of that useless stuff in there to give the book more length.<br /><br />Overall, it is a decent read. The movie looks idiotic and a slapstick version of the book. I wouldn't reccomend the book to anyone. But at least it's a fast read and it didn't take up anymore than 2 hours of my day.
B000059ZT4|5.0|Catch a Fire, by Bob Marley & the Wailers, was the first reggae album to show the genre as a serious form of music outside of Jamaica, on par with American and British Rock and Roll and R&B.  Before this 1973 breakthrough, reggae was seen as something of a joke.  Even though Jimmy Cliff's \\"The Harder They Come\\" set the stage, \\"Catch a Fire\\" clinched it.  The album is a solid classic and a masterpiece with lead vocals not just from Marley, but bandmate Peter Tosh as well, on the tracks \\"400 Years\\" and \\"Stop That Train\\".  The deluxe edition features both the original \\"Catch a Fire\\" album, released only in Jamaica in December of 1972 with its two bonus tracks as well as the original album released internationally to the public in May 1973, both with songs like \\"Stir It Up,\\" and \\"No More Trouble,\\" as well as the underrated classic \\"Baby We've Got a Date (Rock It Baby)\\", my favorite song on the album.  Both are also astonishing and the difference in sound between the two is subtle, yet extremely visible, adding to the album's charm and legendary status.  \\"Catch a Fire\\" will leave you begging for more.
B000002KHH|4.0|This is Black Sabbath's best and most famous album, and I'm sure that hardcore Sabbath fans would like to pelt yours truly with hard objects for giving it only four stars. <br />Well, your man Ron just ain't that big a fan is all. <br /> <br />But this album sums up Sabbath's appeal perfectly, no doubt about it. The driving \\"Paranoid\\" (a UK #4 single) is a definite highlight, as is the cartoonishly macabre \\"Iron Man\\". It's not excactly subtle, but Black Sabbath wasn't about subtlety; their drug-and-drink-fueled Dungeons & Dragons-like imagery were just what the angry teenager ordered some 34 years ago, and \\"Paranoid\\" is one album which demands to be played LOUD! <br />The sludgy anti-war song \\"War Pigs\\" and the two aforementioned singles (dealing with insanity and the supernatural respectively) are three of Sabbath's best-known songs, and three of their best as well, and while \\"Paranoid\\" doesn't maintain quite that level of quality all the way through, it still ranks among the absolute classics of the genre, alongside \\"Machine Head\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" (or II, depending on who you ask). <br />A must-have for fans.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I have always been a big Brit fan, but most of her CD's have one or two good songs on them and then I am done listening to them. This CD has all her greatest hits AND her two new songs (Track 16 & 17) surprised me with how good they are. If you only want to buy one Britney CD....buy this one...it is GREAT!!
B00062J00S|5.0|Easily, It's A Wonderful Life belongs near the top of the best movies of all time list. It has become a holiday season fixture and for good reason. The film celebrates a regular American life by demonstrating the importance of one individual, George Baily, to those whose lives he has impacted even when he wasn't aware of it.<br />The movie has wonderful performances from Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore and a long list of others. Frank Capra left a lasting legacy when he gifted us with this one.<br />The story is familiar yet every time I watch this I get caught up in it. Sure, it's a tear jerker at times and sentimental but it is truly an uplifting story with great values and it deserves it's long lasting popularity.
B0006399FS|4.0|After U2's back-to-back disappointments that were \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop,\\" most of U2's long-time fans agreed that 2000's \\"All that you Can't Leave Behind\\" was a giant step in the right direction. \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" continues down the same path. While U2 still can't recreate the exceptional sounds of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby,\\" they have finally moved past their scary, electronica-influenced sound of the mid-90's and rocketed into the new millenium. While the overall sound is comparable to the positive feeling of their latest \\"ATYCLB\\", this new collection is mostly a spiritual jouryney for a U2.    While the world may already be tiring of HTDAAB's opening track, \\"Vertigo\\" (which you can hear on radio stations of every format, Ipod commericals, and recent prime-time TV soundtracks) it reamins very catchy, and is the perfect opener for the rest of the disc. (And by the way, I know \\"catorce\\" means \\"14\\" and I think it's funny). Following it are the lighter sounds of \\"Miracle Drug,\\" which is one of several positive, inspirational pieces; and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own,\\" which while a bit of a downer, is an excellent, more mellow track.    \\"Love and Peace or Else,\\" while certainly a catchy track, feels too propaganda-ish for the spiritual nature of the rest of the CD, and is probably my least favorite on the disc. Luckily it's followed up with my favorite track, \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" which is a powerfully nostalgic look back at oneself. Aside from the whiny sound of the chorus, \\"All Because of You,\\" is another great spiritual song, the lyrics of which could be a thank you to a parent or God. And the acoustic guitar sounds and complicated lyrics of \\"Man and a Woman\\" are not to be missed.    The next two tracks are a quick diversion from the positive feeling the rest of this disc inspires. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" although not an overly angry song, has a very bitter taste; and \\"One Step Closer\\" is quiet and disillusioned. \\"Original ofthe Species\\" doesn't stand out as anything too spectacular, but \\"Yahweh,\\" the disc's closing track, is an upbeat, spiritual life-lesson, and a great conclusion to the album.    All that being said, it's great to hear U2 again. I rushed out to buy this disc on it's November 23 release date and was not at all disappointed. If you enjoyed \\"ATYCLB\\" then you should also enjoy \\"HTDAAB.\\" But if you were hoping that \\"Vertigo\\" was a sign of a return to their electronic sounds of the mid-90's, I'd recommend that you just buy the single (or listen for an IPod commercial).
0688101364|5.0|`Rose's Christmas Cookies' by Rose Levy Beranbaum is a cookie baking book you should have if you enjoy baking cookies, even if you have one or a dozen other books on cookie baking. She gives the same lovingly detailed tutorial on virtually every aspect of cookie baking which you may want to know. I have reviewed two other major cookie books and have skimmed several other books I plan to review and Beranbaum's book stands alone in the amount of detail she gives on cookie baking technique.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with her `Bibles' on bread, pastry, and cakes will be familiar with the depth to which she goes in explaining the secrets of this little corner of baking. There are several reasons that make this book stand out from the pack.<br /><br />First, there is the detailed coverage of cookie baking ingredients and tools. The most important tool aside from the oven is the cookie sheet. I am chastised by reading that my pricy Calphalon jelly roll pans plus Silpat silicone lining is not the best platform for baking cookies. Also, there are great sections on how to deal with some of the more fussy nuts such as hazelnuts and how to tell the difference between unblanched, blanched, slivers, sliced, chopped, medium coarse chop, fine course chopped, and powdered nuts. Also, there is excellent coverage of virtually every other ingredient. Beranbaum, for example, explains the differences between butters and imitation butters and why the imitations simply don't work as well as the real thing. This treatment is especially good in giving formulas for substituting one combination of ingredients for another. The most useful is how to replace brown sugar with granulated sugar plus molasses. This is so easy, I wonder why I bother to stock brown sugar at all.<br /><br />Second, there are the instructions on cookie decorating techniques including very careful pictorial demonstrations on how to use a standard piping bag, an improvised zip top plastic bag piping bag, and a parchment cone piping tool.<br /><br />Third, all recipe amounts are given in both English and Metric units. This may seem unimportant until you get the urge to contribute cookies to a Boy Scout bake sale and want to multiply a recipe by four. As long as you have the proper measuring devices, this is much, much easier to do with metric units.<br /><br />Fourth, almost all recipe procedures are described for both a food processor and a stand mixer. I am genuinely surprised that professional baker Beranbaum prefers the food processor, as the stand mixer technique is very easy to multiply using commercial sized Hobart mixers. But then, this book is about Miss Rose's family recipes, and, while Beranbaum is a professional, her speciality is in writing, teaching, and trying out new ideas rather than grinding out thousands of cookies for a posh Manhattan patisserie. The author is very careful to point out that the two techniques do not give identical results. The food processor will give better results in creating a `Bakers sugar' size from standard granulated sugar and it saves one the trouble of bringing the butter to room temperature. But, there is the danger that your food processor will turn a batch of nuts into nut butter if you run it for too long.<br /><br />Fifth, Miss Beranbaum reserves her precious space for some of the more difficult types of cookies, up to and including a gingerbread replica of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris. No, I am not kidding. It is really in the book with templates and everything. Most of the other recipes in the book are also just a bit less common than average. Where the author does touch on a standard that you will find in other books such as the very thin Moravian spice cookies, you will find tips about handling these extremely delicate cutouts.<br /><br />Sixth, the book gives excellent advice on how to store dough before baking, how to store baked cookies, and how to get cookies through the US Postal Service or your carrier of choice without excessive breakage. I was especially tickled when she said many of these lessons came from her experiences shipping mercury thermometers here and there. Having had an up close and professional relation with precision thermometers as a chemist, I can really appreciate how Miss B learned her lessons.<br /><br />Seventh, the book is divided into unusual but very useful categories such as:<br /><br />Tree and Mantelpiece Cookies<br /><br />Cookies for Giving<br /><br />Cookies to Make for or With Kids<br /><br />Cookies for an Open House<br /><br />Cookies for Sending<br /><br />Cookies for Holiday Dinner Parties (including the scale model of the Notre Dame cathedral).<br /><br />Eighth, in spite of all the professional technical advice, this is still a very personal book with lots of endearing stories about how Miss Rose came upon many of these recipes.<br /><br />Since this book does not cover many of the simpler traditional cookie types, you will actually gain by combining this book with other volumes whose main strength is coverage of the standards. In fact, as good as this book is, it does not preclude a high rating to other cookie books, even other Christmas cookie books, as they may be more suitable for a person who is simply too busy to walk through all the material here and simply wants a reliable Toll House cookie recipe or spice cookie cutout recipe.<br /><br />The most useful advice in a book loaded with advice is the permission to rework cookie doughs as much as you want. They are simply a lot more forgiving than, for example, pastry or biscuit doughs. Cookies are easy baking tasks and you don't really need Ms. Beranbaum's exacting treatment, but if you are not happy unless you know everything you need to know, this book is definitely for you.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for all amateur cookie bakers.choice without excessive breakage.

078322804X|5.0|In a rare instance of a SNL skit translating WELL to big-screen (the only other exception being Wayne's World), John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd produced a hilarious high-speed wild-ride of non-stop laughs. <br /> <br />Completely throwing all known laws of physics out the window (witness the car jumps, surviving a transient hotel bombing, stealing an air-raid-siren et al), the Dynamic Duo of The Blues embarks on a do-or-die Mission From God to reunite their beloved band and save the orphanage that provided them a home growing up against all odds and obstacles? The odds and obstacles? Try the entire Chicago and Illinois state police forces, The Army, a local Neo-Nazi chapter, a hell-bent-on-violent-revenge former fiancee'(Carrie Fisher), a touring band that plays BOTH types of music (Country AND Western!)and a skeptical concert promoter (Steve Lawrence). <br /> <br />Some great guest appearances from Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Cab Colloway, John Lee Hooker and James Brown hold your interest as well as coutless police car pileups, hilarious encounters at Holiday Inns, and snooty French restaurants finding their old bandmates, disastrous gigs at redneck bars, Ackroyd's low-tech resourcefulness and a devastatingly hilarious mall chase that has to be seen to be believed! All throughout, you really get the feeling the two main characters LIVED the blues and not just played them.  <br /> <br />It usre doesn't aspire to high art but it does aspire to hilarious fun and snappy action.
0435905252|5.0|This is definitely a great book, but if you have to read it as a class assignment, don't expect to enjoy it.   <br /> <br />It's not your typical novel.  It's far more than that.  It's a long parable, that's what it really is, and it crackles from beginning to end with emotion and with the earthiness of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br />One thing you will probably notice right away: These African (Ibo) people will remind you very much of what we imagine of Native American peoples.  There are many similarities, with their seeming superstition and strange metaphysical systems; with their dependence on and obeisance to their tribal customs; and with their apparently primitive customs.   <br /> <br />I felt sorry for all of the people of Umuofina and Mbanta and the other villages, because I know what happened to them.  They were destroyed by so-called missionaries, who were backed up by the technology and forcefulness of the so-called civilized worlds (England). <br /> <br />It's bathetic.  No, I don't mean pathetic.   <br /> <br />I felt so privileged to be able to read this author, who is, above all, authentic.  He knows whereof he writes, and, for whatever reason, not too many others can fill his shoes in this respect.  He opened up a world to me that I would otherwise never have known or understood.  It's too bad that it was a tragically closing world.  It's too bad that \\"things fell apart,\\" and that Okonkwo, the angry man who could not reconcile himself to these changes, takes his own life in the end.   <br /> <br />Okonkwo had his hang-ups, for sure, but you can't help but respect the guy.  He's a tragic hero of the first class, and in that respect he stands for all the native African people who have had Christianity and \\"civilization\\" forced down their throats, back in his day (19th century) and, I would suppose, still today. <br /> <br />It reminded me of what sometimes happened in my grade school.  Kids would gang up on some poor fellow because they thought he was aggressive, only to find out later he was perfectly harmless.  This is what happened to Okonkwo and his people.  They got cold-cocked for no reason other than fear on the part of their oppressors, when all the while, they only wanted to live their own lives without bothering anyone else. <br /> <br />This novel will arouse very bittersweet types of emotions in you, and, as a parable, it will make you think hard about your own life.  Are you trying to convert people who want only to lead their own lives?  Are you beating up on someone who would not, probably could not, harm you?  I hope I'm not, and I hope you're not, because you'll be real sorry later.  No, Okonkwo's gods will not haunt you, but your own mind will (unless you have no conscience, and sometimes I wonder if a lot of people don't).  <br /> <br />This novel is a classic.  Read it and feel the pain!  Diximus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0002XDODU|5.0|This disc is simply amazing and was DEFINATELY worth the 9.99 (brand new) I paid for it.  While the other ones were different from each other, this one is much more diverse than them.  Not by any means saying the other ones are bad or inferior, they are brillant too but, this is the fresh new sound of Till Lindemann and Co.  It's like a peppermint lifesaver, a breath of fresh air.  The song \\"Mein Teil\\" caught my attention and blew me away the first time I heard it.  Till's vocals are powerful and captivating as well as the melodies which makes this cd whole.  To all the 1-2 star reviews of this disc, they must want to hear another version of the \\"Mutter\\" cd with different vocals.  Bands need change once in a while.  The power of them is still there, just in a different way.  People may think that Rammstein is on their downward spiral but, IMO the change from \\"Mutter\\" to \\"Reise, Reise\\" was a smart move.  A band may lose fans because of change but, TRUE fans will support that band on whatever path they decide to take.  I HIGHLY recommend this disc or any of the Rammstein releases to anyone.  If you are new to the band or debating on whether to get this or not, PICK IT UP!  If you don't like it right off the bat play it a few more times and let the music sink in.  I loved it right off the bat and was a no brainer when it came to purchasing it.  Rammstein will always have a spot in my collection.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I'll agree with the reviewers that you just have to \\"get\\" these movies, and that a strong understanding of world religious traditions is a necessary background to get it. Expecially important is knowing Buddhism well, what with the emphasis that the \\"real\\" world is an illusion, that it is inherently cyclcal, and so on.    A lot of people disappointed by the second two movies were so because they thought that the series was about kung-fu in a virtual world. But that's not what the series was about, that's the existential metaphor set up in the first film. I can't blame anyone for wanting the later films to be about the metaphor, rather than moving on to their real point: namely the saga of the end of one age in a cyclical universe. There is indeed a bait-and-switch here, and you will either be angered or delighted by the switch. I was delighted.    In the first movie, with all the talk of the real world being an illusion, and freedom coming from knowing the world was an illusion, I said to myself, \\"Cool, they're riffing on Buddhism, I bet!\\". When the Architect started talking about the multiple Matrices, I giggled with delight. \\"I knew it, it's Buddhist cosmology! I bet the 3rd movie will be the Kalachakra Sutra\\". When it the third movie (which was not without its weak spots) did indeed mirror the Buddhist apocylapse, the end of the Kali yuga (black age) to usher in a new golden era in the illusory world, with the understanding that it'll probably all happen again, I was perfectly satisfied. But I came to these films with a lot of background, and seeing them was like recognizing an old friend.    If you wanted this series to be about kung-fu action in the virtual world, to continue to exist only on that literal level, I understand your disappointment. This boxed set is not for you. Get the first movie and pretend the others never happened. If you groove on the philosophical and existential elements of these films, and don't already have the majority of disks in thisset (as I do), this might be for you.
0739313118|3.0|The Da Vinci Code begins with a murder in Paris's famous Louvre museum, home to Venus De Milo and the Mona Lisa.  A famous American scholar becomes a suspect in the crime and must solve the mystery in order to save himself from the authorities.  Full of twists and chases, the story behind the crime reaches all the way back to the days of Christ and deals with a secret society whose job it has been for two thousand years to guard the most precious secrets of Jesus's life and the formation of the Church.<br /><br />Now, you are waiting for me to explain my title \\"Indiana Jones meets Scooby Doo\\".  Ok, here it is:<br /><br />The best parts of the book remind me of the first and third Indiana Jones films (Temple of Doom sucked).  Dan Brown builds his fictional story on just enough truth about Christian history to spark imagination and plant in his readers a kernel that will lead to conversations, research and a deeper understanding of the life of Christ, the Church and the role mankind has played in muddying up the religion.  We shouldn't read his book as \\"The Gospel According to Dan\\", and I would bet Mr. Brown would say the same thing.  But it is a wonderful starting point for someone unfamiliar with the formation of the early church and the political/social choices of the first leaders that have shaped the evolution of the faith.  I have yet to talk to any reader of the book who did not immediately locate a copy of The Last Supper and look for the clues the book suggests exists amid its scene.<br /><br />But with all that highbrow content is a very lowbrow narrative, full of melodramatic mysteries, knock-you-over-the-head-clues and prose that at times sounds like it belongs in a dime store.  The arch of the story is a common mystery (despite the very uncommon content), and is not unlike the plot of an episode of Scooby-Doo (a crime takes place, suspects are identified, people aren't who they say they are and our heroes figure it all out).  At the very end, I half expected the main villain to really be Old Man Withers of the Amusement Park and our two protagonists to enjoy a nice meal of Scooby Snacks.d, I half expected the main villain to really be Old Man Withers of the Amusement Park and our two protagonists to enjoy a nice meal of Scooby Snacks.
B00000K3CK|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been eloquently expressed by our fellow Amazon reviewers here?  Not much-but it's \\"that time of the year\\", I've just ordered the DVD of this classic film, and I can't help adding my two cents to set the goodwill overflowing.<br /><br />One of the very, very few films of this period to actually shoot on location in New York rather than on a studio backlot(fascinating scenes), this original \\"Miracle\\" is about as far from corny as it's possible to get(it's really the two later versions, one for TV, and one of several years ago, that veer increasingly into phoniness and corn).  There are loads of lessons here for any writer or director who might take on a holiday or \\"fantasy\\" film: just play it *straight*, don't cuten it up-period.  Every actor plays this wonderfully written screenplay brilliantly-down to the smallest part-a huge reason why, like \\"Casablanca\\", it's so watchable-over and over again.  John Payne and Maureen O'Hara play two real, live adults who-rare in films-both seem to have \\"real\\" lives; Maureen works at Macy's, and clearly takes her job seriously, a true professional.  The scenes which begin the story where she's desperately trying to wrangle the annual Macy's parade are almost documentarian-totally believable-and that's what helps make the moonshine of \\"the REAL Santa Claus\\" showing up work so well.  Quite differently from our current, special-effects-extravanga-fantasies that present to us an art director's idea of exactly how The North Pole, Santa's reindeer, etc.etc. look, this one leaves all that to our imaginations, and the incomparable Edmund Gwenn plays that jolly old soul with a perfect air of mystery and sagacity.  Others have written about Natalie Wood, and she is really unbelievably great.  Smart, natural, somehow turning scenes that could have been a little cringe-making(chewing gum with Kris at bedtime)into honestly charming and un-icky highlights.  That's a result of HER amazing talent.  If she were off by a hair, the film wouldn't be the perfect thing it is.  I should mention the score, by Alfred Newman, which is really masterfully scored-what that man did with \\"Jingle Bells\\"!  You've got to admit along with Susan(Wood)\\"I believe, I believe, it's silly, but I believe\\".  Silly and wonderful.re off by a hair, the film wouldn't be the perfect thing it is.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Anyone interested in learning American History should definitely watch this documentary of the controversial figure Robert McNamara and his involvement with Vietnam War.  But there is much more to McNamara and history than the Vietnam War.  I wasn't aware of his involvement in WW II assisting in planning and evaluating bombing in Japan.  I also wasn't aware of the fire bombs dropped in Japan prior to the drops of nuclear bombs.  One of his lessons relates to the scale required to reach a war decision.  He listed about 16 cities relating to American cities that were destroyed.  For example, assume 40% of Los Angeles and 90% of Chattanooga were destroyed in Japanese cities, along with 14 others.  This was with horrible fire bombs and is prior to nuclear drops.  His point was that the cost of war was horrible and you could tell he had struggled with involvement with some of the decisions.<br /><br />As it relates to the Vietnam War which was destined to be controversial, the most compelling part was listening to tapes of Johnson and McNamara talk.  This allows the viewer to form his own opinion of what each were thinking.  The bottom line is we work for the President and if he is leaning one way, it's likely the staff will lean that way also.  And I don't mean this as a slam as it was compelling to listen to LBJ's thought process.  Not saying he was right or wrong just that he had an opinion.  Another interesting fact was that Kennedy was prepared to pull substantially out prior to the assassination of high Vietnamese officials.  Also of interest in this period was his task in selecting the burial spot of Kennedy.<br /><br />The closing is quite dramatic.  With a close-up in a car of McNamara driving, he is asked why he didn't state his opinions after he resigned.  And like a good soldier, he fell on his sword and refused to second guess or cause more controversy.  What you see is an aging, intelligent man who gives people the opportunity to see through his as eyes as he was part of the power structure at the time of some costly and critical decisions.  And by his tears, you can see he knows everything wasn't perfect but he did his job to the best of his ability.  Frankly, I wish every cabinet member were required to give this type video exit interview and then be revisited 10 years later for an update.  I think it would make for compelling history.  If you are an American who lived through Vietnam or like American history, I encourage you to watch this and learn.  Don't shoot the messenger.  Pick the pieces that help you form an opinion and learn from them.as he was part of the power structure at the time of some costly and critical decisions.

B00062IDCO|4.0|Many television series don't last for a single season, some may only last one or two years, but some may become highly successful and have as many as seven seasons.  However, as is quite often the case, a series' seventh season is typically its final season giving its actors one last curtain call to rap up loose ends and say farewell to their loyal audience.  Such was the case for the highly successful television series \\"Star Trek Voyager\\", which aired between 1995 and 2001.  Based upon the original \\"Star Trek\\" universe concept created by the legendary Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's, \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" was the fourth television series to take its audience \\"where no man had gone before\\", and began only one year after the highly successful second \\"Star Trek\\" series, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\", closed with its seventh season. For its efforts, a total of 172 episodes of \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" were filmed and aired, with all but the first season having 26 episodes.  The initial first season only had 16 episodes, but was a good start for what ultimately became a fine sci-fi television series thanks to the efforts of Rick Berman, Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor. <br /> <br />What made \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" unique from its three predecessors was its placement within the \\"Star Trek\\" universe.  The previous three series took place primarily in what is referred to as the Alpha Quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Contained within the Alpha Quadrant are the familiar United Federation of Planets guarded by Starfleet, the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire, the Cardassians and several other alien races very familiar to \\"Star Trek\\" aficionados.  Excursions were made into the Beta and Gamma Quadrants (especially in \\"Star Trek: Deep Space 9\\" and its wormhole that lead deep into the Gamma Quadrant), but very little was known about the very distant Delta Quadrant, except for the species known as the Borg that were introduced to Starfleet in \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"thanks to the shenanigans of the interfering & powerful alien known simply as Q (John de Lancie). <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek Voyager\\", then, became the vehicle by which the unknown Delta Quadrant at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy could become known and defined within the \\"Star Trek\\" universe, but not due to human means.  Instead, a very powerful alien (not Q) during the first episode of \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" pulled the starship, a Maqi ship and their respective crews deep into the Delta Quadrant.  Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take a ship several decades to traverse the vast distance to return to Earth. Hence, the seven-year series focused on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew (combined with the Maqi crew), who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of going. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives. <br /> <br />The primary cast members of the seventh season of \\"Voyager\\" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Ensign Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., \\"The Doctor\\", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ), Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the former Borg drone Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Voyager's seventh season begins with the episode \\"Unimatrix Zero, Part 2\\".  In this continuation of the sixth-season cliffhanger final episode, the Borg Queen (Susanna Thompson) decides to destroy the subversive Unimatrix Zero once and for all, but Captain Janeway sees it as an opportunity to infiltrate the Borg collective by way of a virus.  When the Borg Queen finds a cube with three infected drones, she destroys it.  To protect the drones that can visit Unimatrix Zero from being discovered and destroyed, Captain Janeway & Seven of Nine decide to destroy it.   <br /> <br />During the seventh season of \\"Voyager\\", Seven of Nine faces death in episode \\"Imperfection\\", the Doctor is kidnapped in episode \\"Critical Care\\", Lt. Barclay (Dwight Schultz) visits Voyager as a hologram in episode \\"Inside Man\\", B'Elanna discovers shes pregnant in episode \\"Lineage\\", Q visits Voyager again in episode \\"Q2\\", Neelix leaves Voyager in episode \\"Homestead\\" and Admiral Catherine Janeway from the future visits to help voyager home in the two part series final \\"Endgame\\". The best seventh-season episodes, in order of airdate, include \\"Unimatrix Zero, Part 2\\", \\"Imperfection\\", \\"Critical Care\\", \\"Inside Man\\", \\"Body and Soul\\", \\"Lineage\\", \\"Repentance\\", \\"Prophecy\\", \\"The Void\\", \\"Human Error\\", \\"Q2\\", \\"Author, Author\\", \\"Friendship One\\", \\"Natural Law\\", \\"Renaissance Man\\", \\"Endgame, Part 1\\" and series final \\"Endgame, Part 2\\".  The least memorable seventh-season episodes include \\"Flesh and Blood, Parts 1 & 2\\", \\"Shattered\\", \\"Workforce, Parts 1 & 2\\" and \\"Homestead\\". <br /> <br />Overall, I rate the seventh season of \\"Voyager\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was on par with the sixth season for the most part, but ended on a high-note with the series final.  Well done to the actors, writers, producers and crew that brought \\"Star Trek Voyager\\" to life for seven wonderful years.

B00005JMAH|5.0|Having read the series since it was \\"Harry who ?\\" and waited diligently for the Fed-Ex man on release date for each volume, I'd like to think this review might offer a certain narrow perspective which DVD library hounds will find useful.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This film is VERY true visually and thematically to the Third Volume of the J.K. Rowling series concerning young Mr. Potter and his place in the wizarding world.  It is important to realize that Film and Print are different mediums and the size of the print volumes ABSOLUTELY prevents a complete and total inclusion of all details, every character and subplot - so don't whine about the choices that were made by the screenwriter and J. K. Rowling.  Worth buying without a question, although try not to pay retail, ever.<br /><br />HIGH POINTS:<br /><br />Ø Overall image quality and sound transfer<br /><br />Ø Usual clean, well organized menus on Film Disc<br /><br />Ø Inclusion of \\"more than expected\\" elements from the book<br /><br />Ø Finally gone to a standard issue DVD case<br /><br />Ø Wonderfully seemless transition of directorial duties that serve the story telling & character growth VERY well.<br /><br />LESSER POINTS:<br /><br />Ø Extras Disc is slightly too \\"puzzle\\" based and isn't as full as it really should be, frankly, even when you paw your way through it.<br /><br />Ø The cast interviews are a little shallow, but are at least \\"something\\" over the total absence on Film 1 and the \\"skeletons\\" on Film 2<br /><br />Ø There should be more More MORE as far as all the content elements on the Extras Disc including on-location / set and prop and costume sorcery that brought this modern tale to the screen.<br /><br />Peaxe,<br /><br />Rev.

B00005JMUL|5.0|My husband and I took our two children to see Polar Express.  My husband and I loved it!  I would have stayed in my seat and watched it all over again had it been just the two of us.  Unlike one reviewer who stated that you can't get past that you are watching animation, I did.  I got caught up in the characters and they became real to me.  The one little boy who experienced the Christmas spirit for the first time really tore at our heartstrings.  I thought it was beautifully done.  The story line to me was very deep.  Caprturing the very essence of Christmas - our hearts.  It was also very suspenseful during the action sequences. <br /> <br />Our children aged 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 did not like it as well.  I think they were too young.  Our son, now 4 1/2 has been able to sit through a full feature film since he was very young, but it was the first time we brought our daughter to the theatre as she is a very high energy child.   Both of our children sat peaceably throughout, but both were sad afterward.  The movie does carry a sad and eerie feel which proved to be unsettling for our two.  I didn't see any reviews regarding children's ages and opinions, but I think we would have brought them anyway.   <br /> <br />This will definitely be a movie we will purchase when it is available, but it will not compare to seeing it on the big screen. <br /> <br />Merry Christmas! <br /> <br />The Zoromski's
0060955775|5.0|I'd have to admit that when I first picked up this book, after maybe the first chapter I put it down and practically forgot about it. After a few weeks I picked up the book again -- and I'm glad I did. The writing style may not appeal to some readers: I know at first it didn't interest me, but after The Alchemist, and after resolving to stick with it, Coelho's writing grows on you and you end up appreciating it. <br /> <br />What's absolutely amazing and awe-inspiring in this book is that while you're kept hanging almost to the end, everything is so wonderfully paced and written that the events don't detract from the message of life and hope that the book is all about. Even if only in a book, you feel as if you know the characters personally and that you're living in their world and get affected by their lives, Veronika's especially. I know for my part that I was rather stunned when I finally put down the book, stunned and awed and I felt ALIVE and one with Veronika and the rest of the characters. <br /> <br />This is a definite, definite must-read. Coelho truly knows his art.
B0000025YL|4.0|First up - If you are person that considers bands like Cinderella and Warrant good metal bands, forget it. Likewise, if you grew up with bands like Rob Zombie and Limp Bizkit, you probably won't like this album either.     If, on the other hand, you like great heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio, Saxon, and the like...you are in for a treat. Unlike the younger generation - who believes a dropped D guitar tuning and annoying low grunts (which they call singing) constitutes heavy metal - good metal incorporates a thunderous punch yet retains melody and form. Organized mayhem far surpasses a free-for-all noise fest...and thats exactly what Accept achieves with 'Restless and Wild'.     Many people simply cannot handle Udo's high-pitched visceral wails. It's not unlike people that don't like Rush simply because of Geddy Lee's voice. Judas Priest has been very successful with Halford's screams and obvious sexual preference (and yes back then we knew). And what about Ozzy? Here's a guy that is undoubtably the most famous of the genre, yet couldn't carry a tune if he used a forklift. Nowadays, great singers are few and far between - especially in heavy metal, where primal grunts and groans are the norm. Udo certainly isn't Bruce Dickenson, but he is effective and easily fits the niche carved by guitarist Wolf Hoffmann.     Don't be fooled by the picture of Hermann Frank's picture and the twin V's (that became a symbolic staple of Accept). Although a very accomplished axeman himself, Frank didn't perform a single lick on 'Restless and Wild'. This is all about Hoffmann, and he pulls it off remarkably. In my opinion, the mixing could have been better on this album but its nothing to worry about. Hoffmann offers heavy but orchestrated rhythm lines supplemented by crisp solo attacks - that may be a bit too classical for some. There is an obvious influence by Ritchie Blackmore in Hoffmann's chops. Add in a little Randy Rhoads-like flair, and there you have it.The rhythm on 'Restless and Wild' is adaquate but not anything special. Sure the double-bass thunder on 'Fast as a Shark' is great, but the majority of songs simply supplement Hoffmann's guitar work. Bass guitar is almost non-existent...again only a \\"filler\\" for the drive to keep songs going. Thats not a bad thing, just don't expect too much when overall this is a guitar-oriented album.     So, if you like \\"classic heavy metal\\" (which I figure the newbies would call it) and never heard Accept...this is the album - errr CD - for you. Speaking of CD's... My review of this is from vinyl. I've heard of some subtle changes between the two, so for the CD I cannot say. Do yourself a favor - get a good turntable...albums in good condition prove that analog still kicks [...] over digital any day. And if you are an oldie like me and have no idea about 'Restless and Wild' then shame on you and get yourself a copy...be it a CD or one like my old HM Worldwide red vinyl.

Borrow the book from a friend, or local library, because this book, is just average.  His much better ones are, Pelican Brief, Street Lawyer, and A time to kill.  Fantastic books, that if haven't already captured your attention, will.
B000001FRY|4.0|This is not necessarily a review of the \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" CD, but a personal look back at one of the greatest live shows I have ever witnessed. <br /> <br />A little history first. U2 first played in Denver at the Rainbow Music Hall - a converted suburban movie-plex that hosted many great bands from the late 1970s to the mid-80s. I believe it was U2's first American tour in support of the \\"Boy\\" LP. In fact, U2 played at the Rainbow twice on that tour, returning for an encore on the way home. The boys were visibly tired at that second show, but the fans did not mind. Obviously, U2 enjoyed playing in Denver. <br /> <br />The band returned to the Rainbow on the \\"October\\" tour, but that would be the last time Denver fans would see the band in a small venue. <br /> <br />That brings us to \\"War\\" and the third tour. U2 were scheduled to play at Red Rocks - the famous outdoor amphitheater located in the Foothills west of Denver. It was the first weekend in June, a Sunday. The weather was miserable. It was cold and gray with rain and snow falling all morning. There was talk that the show would be moved or postponed.  <br /> <br />But U2 thought the weather was somewhat similar to that found in their native Ireland, and did not disappoint the hardy fans who trooped to Morrison for the show. In fact, U2 showed its concern for their fans in a unique way. They agreed to play the show at Red Rocks, and added a second show on Monday night indoors at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Anyone who had a ticket to the Sunday show could attend both shows. A classy move. <br /> <br />The show at Red Rocks has passed into legend, as documented on the subsequent concert film released the next year. The band loved the setting and the environment, and the show at Red Rocks was a thrilling display of a young band reaching a new plateau. The people who witnessed that Red Rocks show will never forget it, nor the manner in which U2 went out of its way to accommodate their fans. <br /><br />A few months later, the video of the event debuted at The Rainbow for members of the press. It was shown on a large screen, and was much longer and much more interesting than the final product that was sold in stores. The extended opening sequence was a helicopter flight from downtown Denver out to Red Rocks - much longer than the one on the video. The entire show was on the video I saw, not just selected songs. <br /> <br />It was simply mesmerizing. <br /> <br />So, the video that is now available is adequate enough to refresh one's memory of a great concert, but I still long for the \\"director's cut\\" version that I saw back in early 1984. <br /> <br />As for the CD, it is a nice artifact of a band one the verge on conquering the pop world, but I wish all of the cuts were from the Red Rocks show. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|All those pop bands should be ashamed after listen this record. They're so much better. God bless U2
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Elf is a Christmas movie that's actually good. It's cute, goofy and harmless fun. Will Ferrell (Old School) is in top form as a big dork named Buddy who grew up in the North Pole  and he..thinks he's an elf. He is shocked and horrified to find out that he's actually not an elf. He then decides to leave the Northpole and find his real father (James Caan) and hold hands and eat sugar-plums with him lol. Caan isn't exactly a nice guy though and doesn't want to believe that Buddy is his son but who could blame him there. Elf delivers laughs as Buddy for example gets hit by taxi's, attacked by racoons and beat up by a midget that he keeps calling an elf. With lame Christmas movies like Christmas with the Kranks and Surviving Christmas in theaters now you are better off staying in and watching Elf.
B000002P2W|1.0|I love The Who. They are one of the best bands ever. But you would never know it from this record. I don't know what went wrong. The songs are plain stupid! I listened to this record twice trying to like but I had to abandon that effort because my ears couldn't stand the pain. The only half decent song on here is \\"how many friends\\". The rest of the album is garbage. I don't really know how else to describe this record except its trash. You would never know it though from the reviews on this website. Owing to this you may not believe me. So if you are seriously considering buying this record, please listen to it first, otherwise you are going to paying for one overly expensive beer coaster.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This is one of the few reviews that needs to begin with a discussion of the climax. Why? I still want to know how two of the three key pieces that composed the climax occurred. Since it's inappropriate to discuss the specifics of any climax in a review, I'll respect that. But I have to say: not only do I not really understand how it happened, I thought it was very poorly constructed. In addition to that, the dnouement was fairly pedantic and, at best, without real feeling. <br /> <br />OK. So much with the conclusion - the climax and the denouement. The concept for this film - a monster hunter with inexplicable longevity who works for an underground \\"sect\\" of the Catholic Church - isn't a bad one. European monsters have long held our attention: vampires, Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde. The main problem with the attempt to bring all of this together is that the writers didn't truly understand the nature of the monsters, or the fundamental arguments and/or nature of good and evil. What we saw in that regard was mostly sophomoric. <br /> <br />Question #1 that I had: Why was Mr. Hyde in this movie? He seemed to serve only as a prelude to bring Van Helsing to the Church. Things should only exist in a film or book (any medium) if they are integral to the structure - not if they are merely a vehicle. This was a vehicle. There was also a problem with Mr. Hyde: he was larger than The Hulk. And yet, with such incredible strength, Van Helsing not only subdues him, but kills him. Amazing? No. Dumb. <br /> <br />Question #2: Humans in this film were capable of sustaining mind numbing damage. Van Helsing himself should have been dead during his first monster encounter with Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing was hit hard - HARD - multiple times, and didn't appear to sustain even a broken bone.  <br /> <br />Since Van Helsing had somewhat immortal qualities (if the reason for his longevity was touched upon, I missed it), I could understand some of that. But what aboutthe Valerios family? Anna sustained damage throughout the film that would have killed a herd of elephants, and had this rather remarkable ability to walk up walls and do somersaults off of them. What was that about? Is this strength bestowed upon her through some mysticism of the Catholic Church? Who knows? We sure don't. That means it isn't credible. <br /> <br />Question #3: If Dracula wanted Anna dead so badly, and his three \\"brides\\" proved themselves entirely incapable of such a feat after repeated failures, why didn't he do it himself? This is a major problem in many fantasy, horror, thriller, or suspense films (or books for that matter). Instead of trying to work out a reason for why the Dracula figure doesn't take matters into his own hands (which would require too much creativity, apparently), they simply ignore it. But think about it. You're Dracula. You want this girl dead. Your brides can not accommodate your wishes. Would *you* allow them to fail, time and again, or would you just walk into the village and be done with her once and for all? Remember, the longer she remains alive, the worse your chances for survival are. <br /> <br />Question #4: I have never seen a movie where all of the main characters (even a clumsy Frankenstein monster) had such remarkable acrobatic and Tarzan-like vine swinging skills. If anyone was entertained by feat after feat after feat of impossible gymnastic extravaganza, well, I don't mean to insult anyone, but come on. It's absurd. Sure, at some point you have to allow for the suspension of disbelief. But as John Gardner said (and this is a rough paraphrase): \\"Where Folly leads, Judgment must follow. To dumb it down, things need to make sense. Perhaps if these characters had lived in the 21st century, they would have belonged to a circus. But they didn't, and without all of that training, their feats were *impossible*. <br /> <br />Was there anything good about the film? Well, the special effects were good, with the exceptionof all of the Tarzan nonsense. The swinging here and there, and even some of the flying, appeared absurd at times, and obviously CGI created. When we have seen such remarkable special effects in recent years, specifically with the Lord of the Rings films, these flaws are quite glaring. <br /> <br />I was saddened when I looked at the director's credentials. His first film of note was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, starring then child prodigy Elijah Wood. That was a good movie. Since then, he's decided to take the amusement park route. Deep Rising (a squid attacking a ship?) The Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and the introduction of the Scorpion King? All of them, while perhaps stylish and shot well, were poorly written and offered very little climactic satisfaction. In other words, cotton candy. <br /> <br />Just like Van Helsing. <br />
B00006AW2F|4.0|I still remember buying this as an LP when I was just a little 11-year-old Stones fanatic back in the mid-70's.<br /><br />I immediately fell in love with a number of the tracks on here, such as the rousing pop classics \\"Out Of Time\\" and \\"Heart Of Stone\\".  But the three tracks that really made a deep impression on me were the rockers \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\" , \\"Memo From Turner\\" and \\"I'm Going Down\\", all both which are as good as anything on \\"Exile\\" or \\"Black & Blue\\".<br /><br />\\"I Don't Know Why I Love You\\" is another killer track, featuring some of Mick Jagger's most emotive vocalizing ever and some absolutely gorgeous electric slide guitar from Mick Taylor.<br /><br />Sure, there are a few clunkers on here, which is why this ain't a 5-star album, but it definitely deserves 4 stars for the aforementioned songs.<br /><br />Any Stones fan must add this to their collection. Rock just doesn't get any better than early 1970's Stones.
B000002LGQ|3.0|Like a Prayer is, along with Ray of Light, often proclaimed to be Madonna's musical masterpiece. Honestly, I don't understand this. Her lyrics did in fact mature, but to me, lyrics are meaningless if not paired with beautiful music. The music of Like a Prayer, with some exceptions, is generic and has not held up well over time. <br />Like a Prayer: 5/5 This is the best Madonna song of the 80s. It is beautiful, sexy, powerful, haunting, and playful. It is immensly fun to listen to, dance to, and conjure up wild erotic images to. <br />Express Yourself: 4/5 I'm being generous to this song because I like the music video. It's repetative and flat.  <br />Love Song: 4/5 This collaboration with Prince is bizarre, but fun. It's obviously Prince's song rather than Madonna's. <br />Till Death Do Us Part: 4/5 Just another carbon dance song with a couple of glasses smashing in the background. <br />Promise to Try: 4/5 This is a bittersweet little ballad. It's nothing spectacular, but it's quite sad and pretty. <br />Cherish: 5/5 This song is incredibly cheesy, but it's a good European cheese as opposed to those slices that come wrapped in plastic and taste like cat hair. <br />Dear Jessie: 5/5 This is unlike any Madonna song ever produced. It's a fantasy lullaby extravaganza and wonderfully innocent. It's my second favorite song on the album, even though lots of people hate it. Oh well.  <br />Oh Father: 5/5 Dear Jessie segues perfectlly into this desperate, tortured ballad. It's one of Madonna's best. This and Promise to Try are the first times she dealt with her past in her songs. <br />Keep it Together: 3/5 The album goes downhill near the end. This is yet another mediocre dance tune with a family love theme. <br />Spanish Eyes: 3/5  Yet another ballad, this is the weakest on the album. It has a latino flavor which is refreshing, but it seems to plod along, sounding much like elevator music in a white, upper-class mexican restaurant.    <br />Act of Contrition: 3/5 This isnot a song, but is interesting to listen to anyway. It's a unique way to end the album, bringing the religious themes full circle. Unfortunately, after one listening it just gets annoying. <br />The best songs on this album are Like A Prayer, Cherish, Dear Jessie, and Oh Father. Other than Dear Dear Jessie, all of the others are available on a compilation album. If you're a collector, buy this album. Or if you want to prove that I have absolutely retched musical taste. I'm fine with that.
B0002Y4T92|2.0|I was in Dallas for this concert and I have to confess the <br />DVD is rather disappointing to me. Since I'm more inclined <br />to Jazz/Blues it was sad to see Pat Metheny and the B.B King <br />left out. I understand they may not have reached a deal but <br />still it is a pity. Also the participation of other names such as <br />John McLaughlin is minimal.  <br /> <br />I'm selling my copy...
B00008CLOA|5.0|Album sales are usually not a good measure of musical quality (in fact, they rarely are), but in this case, the numbers don't lie. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the best-selling album of all time, and deservedly so.  From the opening heartbeat sound, to the closing heartbeat sound, this is pure musical perfection.  Up till this point, the band made a series of meandering acid rock albums, which are very cool, but here everything just really came together.  You've still got the wacked-out psychedelia, but with much more focused songwriting.  David Gilmour is a true guitar god, and Rick Wright is my favorite rock keyboardist ever.<br /><br />I would describe the songs, but hopefully I don't have to, as every single track on this disc has become a staple of rock radio, and is still regularly played to this day.  That's really saying something, I think.<br /><br />Simply put, this is, and forever will be, one of the greatest albums of all time.  Every serious music fan should have this in their collection.  If you don't, you should be stuffed into a box, and sent over Niagara Falls.  Or, you could just buy it.  That seems like a more pleasant choice to me.
B000002LQR|5.0|RHCP are one of my favorite bands ever and are the best live act I've ever seen, and this IMO is their strongest album. Filled with raw emotion, crazy lyrics, and a great overall vibe, Blood Sugar Sex Magik is one of the best albums out there . Anthony is amazing, with his creative lyrics and soulful singing, John's guitar work is funky and gorgeous, Flea's bass parts are, of course, outstanding. Chad's drumming is awesome too. These guys carry a timeless, distinctive and unique sound that is great over a decade after this album was created. Unlike a lot of bands I listen to, RHCP really makes you feel good after listening to them- something that really proves their talent.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs are Suck My Kiss, Give It Away, I Could Have Lied, and If You Have to Ask. This CD really marks the new era of the chili peppers and really earned them a whole new level of fame. Buy this cd, you won't be dissapointed.
B00030590I|5.0|Rates 5 Stars - More is said with looks than dialogue - artfully constucted story/film.  If one is interested in the Asian culture, sense of duty and loyalty, this film portrays those virtues.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Maybe it's just me, but I really hate DVD sets that have hidden features.  When I shell out money for something, just give it to me, don't make it like a video game that has characters to unlock.  The discs in this set have some features that can be viewed only by playing with the various menus to find the other options.  I get annoyed by this.   <br /> <br />Now that that is out of my system, I loved Seinfeld over its entire run, watching the premiere when it first aired and then watching the series till it ended.  The episodes are presented in the order they were filmed rather than the order they aired, which actually makes the continuity better for this set.   <br /> <br />The Notes About Nothing, an option that displays trivia about the cast, crew, and storyline as the episodes play, are OK, but at times they scroll by three lines at a time too fast to read without pausing the disc, and I read fast.  Had that been remedied before sending these out, I would be much happier with the feature. <br /> <br />The best part of the set, to me, is the outtakes.  When this cast gets to laughing I just lose it, and you can tell from most of the episodes that there were lots of smiles and laughing that went on, from the expressions on the actors' faces and how they are often shot from behind in certain scenes.  I would have liked more outtakes, but for a fifteen year old show they might not have any more than these.  Still great viewing, though. <br /> <br />The behind-the-scenes stuff is OK, if a bit dry and somewhat padded in length by clips from the shows themselves.  The audio commentaries that can be run are pretty disappointing.  There are none with all four cast members, which would have rocked, but some have three (all but Seinfeld), likely due to the money issues that delayed this set so long in the first place. <br /> <br />All in all, I am happy with the purchase, even if the features are not so great, mainly because I love the show and can now watch whichever episodes I like whenever I want.
B000001Y42|2.0|A couple of years ago, I went through this major anti-Limp Bizkit phase, where I basically hated everything to do with them, and even went as far as to think it's objectively wrong to like them.  Well, I'm past that immaturity now, and while I still mostly hate their music, I was able to manage to give this CD another chance.  And as a result, I've come to realize that Fred Durst is the problem, not the band overall.<br /><br />You might not realize it from listening to their later material, but they are actually talented musicians.  Wes Borland used to have a unique and interesting guitar style, and John Otto is a pretty solid drummer.  There's actually a lot of pretty cool music going on on this album, but Fred Durst completely ruins it.  For instance, if you take \\"Sour\\", remove the vocals, and leave it as just an instrumental, you have a pretty cool piece of music, with an odd guitar melody, and jazzy drumming.  But then, you put Fred Durst shouting like an idiot over it, and it's barely listenable.  That's basically what the whole album is like.  Some of these songs aren't that great musically either, but the ones that are are destroyed by Durst's annoying voice.  The only song I really enjoy here, is \\"Everything\\", which is an atmospheric 16-minute instrumental.  It's nothing amazing, pretty much the same melody played over and over, but it's a nice peaceful track to get the ringing of Durst's horrible vocals out of your head.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  This could have been a good album, maybe even a great one, but the stain of Fred Durst brought it down.  And it's only gotten worse from there.  Durst clearly has no aspirations but to use music as a get-rich-quick scheme, and he's dragging these otherwise talented musicians along with him.  He's even said himself that Limp Bizkit is just a fad that no one's going to care about in 10 years, and he doesn't even care.  Not as long as it helps him rake in millions of dollars.  These guys need to ditch this loser, and find a new singer who actually has talent.  Might I suggest one Mike Patton?  Give him a call, guys.  You won't be MTV superstars anymore, but he'll actually help to stimulate your creativity, rather than suppress it.  Fred Durst deserves to be pumping gas or flipping burgers.  The music industry has no place for him.is loser, and find a new singer who actually has talent.  Might I suggest one Mike Patton?  Give him a call, guys.

B00030590I|4.0|Great fight scenes  <br /> <br />The movie looks as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and sounds as good as (the soundtrack is excellent) Crouching  Tiger but something is missing.  I think its just the simple fact that most audiences in North America don't know much about the unification of China and don't care much about the unification of China.   <br /> <br />Personally, while I liked the movie a lot the simple factor really cut down on my ability to care for the characters  <br />DVD-Got some great features but I still felt a little short changed, good thing this was a rental.   <br />

Too bad the evil[...], conservate, corprate, war mongering, red states took our nice fat tax cuts and bought off all the black, hispanic, and [...] community to vote for Bush, the \\"anti-christ\\". mwahaha.  It really tore us up over here to here that our highly qualiified, commited senator, and rightful leader got cheated out of the presidency by a bunch rich overweight white men, namely Haliburton.

0446691437|4.0|It's clear. It's concise. It's a deceptively easy read. It is not a how-to book, nor is it self-help. It's a slim volume of marching orders. If you're a malcontent or a prodigy, you'll hate it. If you're a genuine cynic (i.e., a romantic who knows better), you'll take some solace in it. And if you're seeking inspiration, it'll kick you in the pants.
B0006399FS|5.0|Now back on track \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is proof why U2 are living rock legends. The high voltage \\"Vertigo\\" kicks it off and there's no turing back from there. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a heart felt tribute to Bono's father that will go down as a U2 classic. This is one album U2 fans can be proud of
B000002U8G|4.0|this is a pretty good album.  It marks a turning point for Pink Floyd, where they were finally making music with possible pop success without compromising their style of psychedelic rock.  It also has some awesome songs.  \\"one of These Days\\" is an awesome bass-driven instrumental that sets the bar for the rest of the album.  \\"Fearless\\" is another classic that surprisingly doesn't get as much recognition as a hit as it should, because frankly, i don't understand why it didn't make them famous right then and there. But that's not important, what is? ECHOES!!!!!!! This is a masterpiece and if \\"Wish You Were Here\\", it would be their best song ever.  This is one of those songs where by the time it's over, you realize it's more than just a song.  It's an experience. The beginning is classic floyd, then it kicks into a blues jam session that's just plain classic.  Then, after a couple minutes of screams (Which i don't really care for), the song turns into an epic guitar tab. Then it ends the way it began.  My only complaint is that when you listen the whole thing from start to end, by the time \\"Echoes\\" is over, you forget that the other songs even exist.  But who cares, this album rocks!!!!!!!
B00018D44U|4.0|Maybe it's because the first recording got so much radio overplay; maybe it's because the first seemed a bit too \\"all the notes fit into the perfect place;\\" or maybe it's because the guy in the record store said to me about the first album \\"I think she's the female James Taylor,\\" which about made me hurl.  But this recording feels edgier (to the extent one can say \\"edgy\\" and Norah Jones in the same sentence) than the first, and somehow more heartfelt.  I caught her live last night and certainly the new material comes off a lot better in a live format, when the keys, drums and occasionally brilliant guitar solo have a more passionate sound.  But the studio version of these songs is still great.  I'd have given the first album a 3 star rating, and I give this one a 4, simply because the passion I heard last night doesn't quite come across through the studio production.  I suspect all the tracks are a bit watered down to sound more like the first record and not alienate the fans who come to Norah Jones looking for \\"easy listening.\\"  (It's like what happened to the Replacements on Don't Tell a Soul.)  I can't wait to hear a live recording of these songs.  That's when they'll really fly.
B0002S94OS|1.0|A friend of mine purchased this latest Lamb Of God release, and wanted to listen to it in my car, so I let him put it in. This album sounds like someone sending a piece of wood through a chipping machine, while screaming and beating on a trashcan. I couldn't believe that my friend liked garbage like this. It has no good drum beat and no good guitar or bass playing, just lots of useless noise. The band might not be half bad if the lead singer actually sang. That's right, instead of screaming a bunch of jibberish that no one can understand, why not do what good rock singers do, just sing! Before I conclude my review on this piece of trash, I would like to comment on something that I saw this band do to one of their fans. As many of you may know, MTV has a new show called \\"Battle For Ozzfest\\" where multiple bands compete for a chance to make it big in the death metal scene. Anyway, on the other nights episode, the members of one band were given the task of dressing up in various embarassing costumes and then going out on stage to introduce the bands. The one guy that had to introduce Lamb Of God was wearing some sort of short shorts and a fake gold dollar sign necklace. Well, the lead singer of Lamb Of God figured that it would be cool to harass and further embarass this guy all through their show. They made the man do stupid dances while they played and at one point the lead singer of Lamb Of God spit in the guys face and then the bands security threw the man off stage. This made me sick. I will never support a band or musical artist that treats their fans in that way. Later that night, the guitar player from Lamb Of God tried to repent by inviting the guy to some cheap drinking party on a tour bus. That gesture did not impress me one bit. The actions and music of this band are truly sickening.
B000002A46|5.0|This is the best Christmas Album I still had since it came out.  My brother bought it for me on the year 1994 and I still have everything in original package. I listen to this every Christmas time and I have bought other Christmas cd's like Christina Aguilera, Just got Jessica Simpson's and others I can't remember.  Nothing beats this cd.  If you are looking for a good Christmas album I highly recommened this first before you sample any other. If I have a second choice I would pick: Now thats What I call music  Christmas album.  Thats really good too!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napolean Dynamite is by far the best movie of 2004. It's creativty and uniqness is unmatched by anything else coming out of the mediocre Hollywood comedy industry. The best thing about Napolean for me, is the characters. Each has thier own completly out there personality but the funny thing is, you know people that remind you of the characters. Some say there was no plot but that is another theme of the story. These people are so boring they have no plot lines in their existence. The PG rating is also very appealing to me. I love Office Space, Clerks, and movies like that but they all have unnecasary moments. Napolean replaces curse words with stupid irrelevant words but that also adds to the humor. I saw this movie with my girlfriend and we have been quoting it ever since. If you hav not see the film, I suggest you see it as soon as possible. Buy it if possible because I assure you, you will be wanting to watch it over and over.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd and particularly Roger Waters, had three basic modes: melancholy, hallucinogenic and angry. Most of thier music was written in one of, or a combination of, these styles. I will leave it to the individual to decide which he or she prefers but this album is definitely in the third category. It wasn't a style they employed very often and in this album it is complete and resolved. In stark contrast to the dreamy hippie qualities of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\", this one is aggressive and unbridled in its cynicism. <br /> <br />The style was innovative, particularly the guitar sound and chord work. Gilmour is a widely acknowledged genius and many said that by the early '80's it was a pity he was so rich that he didn't have to try anymore. He is mostly known for his superbly melodic lead and fill playing and whilst this album includes some of that, it is his impressive chord work which carries the day here. Roger Waters' lyrics and bass playing are, in this reviewer's opinion, his best work. I have always found him a little self-indulgent but this time he delivers in a way which makes \\"The Wall\\" look rather pathetic. Rick Wright doesn't just play keyboards on this album, he provides a huge atmospheric input with massive amounts of tape manipulation and fill effects. <br /> <br />How this gem went past the general public almost unnoticed is beyond me. This is Floyd at their peak. Compared to what went before and after it, \\"Animals\\" is totally out of the blue. It doesn't really tally with, nor can it be adequately compared with, any of their other albums. It fits beautifully in synch with the late '70's: punk-ish sort of themes and guitar sounds very similar to what Andy Summers was doing with \\"The Police\\". <br /> <br />\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was a monolith because it broke so much new ground. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" signalled a change in mood. Both of these albums have been acclaimed as the band's best but neither have the clear definition of \\"Animals\\" and I consider this one to be a better indication of their abilities. If you asked \\"If this is what they're capable of: what will they do next?\\" after the release of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" the answer is \\"Animals\\". <br /> <br />Where were you in 1977?
B0002XDODU|5.0|As a Rammstein fan since their first album, Herzeleid, I've been waiting for them to get back to the raw feel that they carried years ago. This album is everything I expected and more. The blues harmonica backup in Los is fantasic, and the driving guitars on Reise, Reise are breathtaking. The first two singles released from this album don't do the entire thing justice. Overall, REISE, REISE ranks amoung the best albums Rammstein has released, and I hope they continue to release more fantastic music.
B000002AVF|5.0|in my opinion it is the best album that was ever made! <br />it's just great, each track is well done produced, and well done written, and ofcurse, mariah's amazing voice! <br /> <br />if you want one mariah carey album get this one...  <br />usually in every album that I hear there are songs that I skip and don't like, but there is no such a thing in this album... <br /> <br />it is a pop album with small touchs of RnB-soul. <br />there are the number 1 hits: fantasy, always be my baby, and \\"one sweet day\\"( that were number 1 for 16 WEEKS!!!) <br /> <br />I think I said enough, and If you buy this album I\\"m full of doubt that you\\"ll regret... <br />
1400082773|5.0|Dreams From My Father is a wonderful memoir about the life  of Senator elect Barack Obama from Illinois.  The experiences in  this book are very descriptive and vivid.  This book has three parts to it.  The first part is entitled Origins.  In this section, he talks about being raised in Hawaii by his white mother and grandparents.  I recognized and enjoyed reading about all of the  beautiful locales he describes while in living in Hawaii.  He also writes about his education at a prestigious prep school in Honolulu, and that he felt like a minority there being half black and half white.  The first section of the book also talks about the he spent in Indonesia as a child and being briefly raised as a muslim by his step father.  He ate snakes as a child and saw beggars daily while living there.<br /><br />The second section of this book is about Barack Obama's life in Chicago and his work as a neighborhood organizer.  This section is the book really describes how he develops a passion for public service.  My favorite part of this section is how he tries to improve the education system and living conditions of low income residents in a neighborhood called Altgeld in Chicago.<br /><br />The third section of this book is about how Obama travels to Kenya to learn about the father he never knew and meet his long lost family and his biological father he barely knew.  I really liked his description of the land in Kenya and his experience of going on an African safari.<br /><br />This memoir also includes the keynote address Obama delivered at the Democratic National Convention.  This is a very moving  speech.  Barack Obama has lived a very interesting life.  I think he is an eloquent writer as well as a great public speaker. I loved reading this book.
B00006879E|1.0|I am concerned that this band is successful.  They should have never been signed.  Low-quality pap for the radio.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think this CD is much improved over Avril's debut because there's no song that I really dislike.  My absolute favorite is \\"Fall To Pieces.\\"  Other ones I really enjoyed were \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" \\"Slipped Away,\\" and \\"Take Me Away.\\"  \\"Nobody's Home\\" has also really grown on me as I've heard it on the radio.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is one of the best books I have read recently. It doesn't have the best plot or character development, but it has a lovely underlying meaning and depth. It is not a book you read for a story, it is an inspirational book to be read for pure symbolism.
B000003TAR|5.0|Maybe I'm going too far calling it a masterpiece, this is just one awesome album from start to finish, however, it is for the real Nirvana fans who are willing to set their ears for some raw powerful sound very different from the catchy radio-friendly Nevermind tunes. <br /> <br />This album has the real essence of Nirvana's true sound that began in Bleach and can also be found on Incesticide.  <br /> <br />It has some really catchy songs scattered around some really heavy and wild ones, Heart-shaped Box, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea and All Apologies could be the catchy ones...a sound resembling Nevermind. <br /> <br />Scentless Apprentice, Very Ape, Milk It, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter and Tourette's are the raw stuff... <br /> <br />The other songs (Serve The Servants, Rape Me, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle) I couldn't really classify...they're not that hard, they're quite catchy really. <br /> <br />Buy this if you wanna experience the true sound of Nirvana and the great lyrics of Kurt Cobain, not expecting it to sound like Nevermind.  <br /> <br />You don't need \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to make one hell of a record.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad was a wonderful book. Kiyosaki has a unique way of teaching people about money. Before i read this book, i always thought you must work for money, however, this is obviously not true according to Kiyosaki. Instead, money must work for you. I happen to agree with many of his ideas and i plan to own my own business, rather than work for someone. Kiyosaky definately gets his message across to the readers and influences people to go out and make money.
0142000663|1.0|The book \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was a great book for showing the effects of the dust bowl and depression on Americas people. This book shows how america has changed from a state of chaos and uncertianty in the dust bowl of the 1930's. Now it is a state of what america was meant to be, a land of success and prosperity. We truely see America as a place of confusion and uncertianty in the entire trip that the Joad's made. The Joad's don't know where they are going throughout the whole trip they were going to a better place for everyone(so they thought). The confusion happened thoughout the whole trip because they had heard so many good things about this wondewrful new land of work and money. As they go their though they realize through the people coming and going from the land of 'prosperity' that it isn't all that it's cooked up to be. They learn through people and their own experiences that the land of prosperity for one man isn't that for the other. But, they are confused and uncertian about this througout the whole book until at the end they realize that this land doesn't mean prosperity, it means death for them, but at that time it's too late.<br /><br />I didn't like this book because I believe it took to long to get to things. I think they could have cut out several chapters about the tractors and migrates because they just repeated themsleves and didn't really state a strong knew point. I would have enjoyed it more if they had condensed it and threw out some of the unnecessary stops and converstions as well as chapters and people they meet. I do believe most of the people were important like the Wilsons and the people at the government camp like Thomas, Mrs. Sandry, etc. But, the people they talk to at the stops sometimes and people they associate themselves with for a night that takes a chapter. Why do you even put them in? This book could have been a lot shorter if you cut out alot of the unnessecary things.<br /><br />I think this book has very good themes and gives you a good idea about what the 1930's and dust bowl was like though. I shows you the pain and suffering that people had to endure in different ways and ages. They showed you the Granma and Granpa, Ma and Pa, Al, Tom, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and Casey, Winfeild and Ruthie. Each person show you how this effected their age of people and the way they did things and conducted themselves. This doesn't acount for everyone in their age group, but a good portion. One example is Tom. He resembles the common worker who is ambicious and angry at where he is. It shows him nearly killing himself to try to get fair work and to be respected at the same time. Everyone resembles a different group in America and how they were effected by the turn of events that was happenign in America.<br /><br />I liked the books purpose, theme, and reasons for writing it. I think that some of the individual componients could have been changed, but over all I can look over those and see a very well written book with a great meaning and purpose.u a good idea about what the 1930's and dust bowl was like though.

B0002YLC24|5.0|Like most sequels to get the most out of this film it's helpful to have seen its 1994 predecessor Before Sunrise, helpful, but not essential.  Even without knowing the story behind these former lovers the film's brilliant director Richard Linklater gives you just enough background to enjoy the interplay between these wonderfully written characters anyway.  That being said I've been waiting to see more of these characters since they appeared in a brief scene in Linklater's animated film Waking Life. <br />  The chemistry between actors Julia Delpy and Ethan Hawke is obvious and infectious.  The best part, however, is the brilliant dialogue.  In the first film the actors were performing a well written script by Linklater and Kim Krizan and it worked very well.  In this film, however, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have written the dialogue for Celine and Jesse together and have breathed even more realism into the interplay between the characters.  The beautiful thing is that the film-long conversation is something you could imagine overhearing in a neighborhood coffee shop.  Unlike the majority of films these people actually talk like people.  At one point in the film while describing his failing marriage Jesse says \\"I feel like I'm running a small nursery with someone I used to date\\", this line describes Jesse's feeling that something is missing in his life beautifully.  It's also incredibly realistic and a line that I could imagine coming out of someone's mouth in a real conversation.  So few films are able to achieve this realism in dialogue and it serves to represent these characters as ordinary people. <br />The romance in the film is also true to life.  There are awkward moments, serious disagreements, and unspoken desires; in short it's a natural depiction of how men and women relate to each other romantically.  Most films take the easy way out and present us with an idealized version of romance, lots of flowers, romantic tactics, and dreamy kisses.  BeforeSunset knows that this is not how it works.  These people had a brief one-night romance nine years previously and it both enriched them and damaged them.  They get back together and have feelings of hope, excitement, and lust, sounds like romance to me. <br />The bottom line here is that if you liked the first film you will enjoy this one.  In many ways it is a better written film with a grittier realism to it.  After nine years Celine and Jesse have become our friends and we care what happens to them.  I only hope it won't be nine years before we find out what happens next. <br />
B000003TAB|5.0|This may not be one of those albums you fall in love with the first time you listen to it, but after a couple of listenings try to realize that it is a great collection of really cool underground songs. <br /> <br />A lot of reviewers have said that the first half is great with catchy tunes and cool songs and the second is dark and almost unlistenable. Then let the second half grow in you, in my opinion, the second is the best part of this album. <br /> <br />Really noisy, raw, hard, powerful songs fill the second part, Mexican Seafood, Hairspray Queen, Aero Zeppelin and Big Long Now are outstanding songs. <br /> <br />I find Big Long Now to be a real gem, creepy almost scary guitar and haunting lyrics, Kurt's voice is really amazing here. <br /> <br />An album for the die-hard Nirvana fans, for those who really liked In Utero and Bleach. <br />Not for those who expect another Nevermind.
B0006399FS|4.0|How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb was the kind of CD that takes a few listens to really get into it.  While a few of the songs are instant classics, at first listen the CD sounded somewhat mediocre, especially in the 2nd half after the suprisingly cool track A Man and A Woman.  However, it's really grown on me as I begin to appreciate the nuances of every song.   <br /> <br />It's not a perfect CD; the last two tracks or so don't do much for me and I feel that even the best moments don't soar as high as the best moments of the classic albums like Acthung Baby or Joshua Tree.  But second-tier U2 is better than most of what's out there.  The CD is a definite keeper.
B00065EB2M|5.0|First of all... this set is all about loving the Apollo moon missions. If you do, then you have to have this set. If you don't, learn some background on Apollo and you'll appreciate it much better.<br /><br />With 6 discs and hours and hours of footage (including all of the moonwalks from the mission) the set kept me busy for weeks. I watched this on TV when I was 12 and was fascinated... now I am even more astounded. Amazing how things look different, and how much more you notice as an adult.<br /><br />Coolest things about the set: during launch you can select to listen to the astronauts talking to one another inside the capsule as they are launched. I've never heard that before and it is a hoot! Also, there are several angles of the launch to see, as well as a cool flyover of the landing site (which for this mission was very rugged).<br /><br />One of the things I like best is that you can enjoy the footage without a filter... no one trying to \\"interpret\\" what is happening for you. (They annoyed me by stepping on the sound of the astronauts when I was 12, and I am sure they would annoy me now). I loved Cronkite and all, but would rather just hear what was happening!<br /><br />There are other sets in this series that are also good... (Apollo 11, 15, 13 and others). I'm glad the stuff is finally available (and looks great on DVD) as I've been looking for it for years.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00004Y87O|5.0|Here is a novel idea:  what if the city of New York was turned into one gigantic prison?  Wouldn't be able to tell much difference from what it is today, you say?  Well, maybe not.  However, it's an interesting concept nonetheless.<br /><br />There is just one problem with this plan:  how do you extract a VIP from a city full of condemned prisoners?  In this case, the VIP is the president of the United States.  Terrorists hijack Air Force One and the pres is forced to bail over Manhattan before his plane crashes into the city.  [Note:  in the wake of 9/11, the scene of a 747 going down near the Twin Towers is quite chilling].<br /><br />The know-it-all police / security force (stationed right outside the prison walls) have one chance to rescue the president on such short-notice:  Snake Plissken.<br /><br />Snake (played by Kurt Russell) is a former Special Forces commando gone bad.  As the movie opens he is on his way to New York himself to pay for the bad things he has done.  Now his daring and soldiering skills are needed to win back his liberty.  The rules are simple:  if he succeeds, he goes free.  If not, he dies.<br /><br />For fans of John Carpenter flicks this one is  a can't miss.  It was an instant-classic in the theaters and has remained one ever since.  Here is a way to take a tour of New York from your living room - with Kurt Russell as your tour guide!  Hopefully NY is a wee bit more tame in real life....
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am not very much of a Green day fan, but I got this album after hearing \\"American idiot\\". It is cool. If you are a massive green day fan, then don't expect this to be like \\"Dookie\\" (their breakthrough). This album is more of a mix between fast, rocking songs, and matture softer songs, and two rock operas, ofcourse. The songs are: <br /> <br />1. American idiot: Perfect way to start the album. Fast and fun, though it gets a bit boring now, after hearing it so many times on the radio. 5/5 <br />2. Jesus of suburbia: The first rock opera. It starts with the heavy \\"Jesus of suburbia\\",m then to the softer, but darker \\"City of the damned\\" (my fav), then to the fast punky, but slightly repetative \\"I don't care\\", then to the short slow, 60s-like \\"Dearly beloved\\", then finally the rocky \\"Tales of another broken home\\". 5/5 <br />3. Holiday: One of my favourites. It's just a normal, fast pop and punk rock song. 5/5 <br />4. Boulevard of broken dreams: A darker, slower song, with electric and acoustic guitar in it. Their new single. 5/5 <br />5. Are we the waiting: It grows on you. The chorus is kinda weird sounding, with the band all singing \\"Are we, we are, are we, we are the waiting\\" but I like the verses. Again, quite soft. 4.5/5 <br />6. St Jimmy: The fastest, punkiest song on the album. Really heavy, catchy and just plain fun. At times, it does get a little repetative. 4/5 <br />7. She's a rebel: Pretty short, again, kinda heavy, but a bit soft at times. 4/5 <br />8. Give me novacaine: This took a while to grow on me. The verses are really soft, the chorus may seem unimprerssive at first, but you need to listen to the song a few times. 4.5/5 <br />9. Extraordinary girl: I don't really like the weird drum intro, but once the song breaks out, it's pretty good, It's pretty different, but good. 4.5/5 <br />10. Letterbomb: The guitar intro is cool. More of a pop-rock song again, and the chorus is unbelievably catchy. Why does a girl sing at the start of the song? Anyway, a good song. 5/5 <br />11. Wake me up when Sep ends: The first half of the song is softer and acoustic, then the last half is heavy and electric. One of my favourites. Nice solo and an interesting song. 5/5 <br />12. Homecming - the death of St Jimmy: The last of the two reock operas. The first \\"death of St Jimmy\\" is the best one, for it's rocking guitars and fun, sing-along verses and chorus. Then \\"east 12th St\\" is pretty fast and punky. Then \\"Nobody likes you\\" another good part of the song. It is very weird, and slow, it sounds like a choir song. Then \\"Rock and roll girlfriend\\", I think Tre, the drummer sings it. It is just a short 1-minute long, funny rocky bit of the song. In \\"Were coming home\\" it starts off a bit fast, then it goes slower, but it's still good. This might be the best out of the two rock operas. 5/5 <br />Whatsername: My favourite song on the album. Kinda slow to start off with, but I love the bridge and the solo. It's about remembering an old girlfriend, but not remembering her name. Great album closer. <br /> <br />So, don't expect this to be like \\"Dookie\\". At times it is, but not much. Still, if you love Greenday, or other pop-punk bands, get this.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Bush is not the enemy here, Michael Moore is. Do yourself a favor. If you must see this piece of propoganda, be sure to immediately view the REAL documentary called FarenHYPE 911 right after seeing it. I did and i was shocked at how Michael Moore lied to us. He distorted and fabricated the facts, he lied, he twisted the truths all in the self-serving name of making money to help line his pockets with money and help pay for his 2.5 million dollar condo. This guy is a sham. The fact that the public believes him as if he is some kind of truth-telling god is a sin of the worst kind. I'm glad people are starting to come forward with the truth about how he lies and distorts the facts. Books and articles are being written about him, and they are not flattering at all.  What is scary is that before i saw FarenHYPE 911, i actually believed his movie. Thank-you to the producers of the REAL documentary for shedding light on what a liar he is. He totally dishonored and  disrespected the families of the men and women who fought in the war for his freedom by making his movie. He needs to be stopped. And if you want the truth about his other piece of crap, go to [...]. The only GOOD thing about Farenheit 911 is that Michael's scruffy, obese, over-fed disgusting face and body are seen in the movie for less than five minutes. Why doesn't he take his millions and either get liposuction or join a diet clinic instead of forcing his lies and distorted facts on the public? I totally hate this turd of a film-maker. Please boycott this movie and see FarenHYPE 911 instead. You'll never want to see another Michael Moore film after watching it.
B0006399FS|5.0|Believe the hype.  \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is the best U2 album to date.  It is not only their most personal piece- it is their most uplifting:  \\"Achtung\\" with optimism.  I listened to it in my car on a cold and wet November day.  When the c.d. ended I felt as if the sun had been shining on my face for 55 minutes. <br /> <br />These are not beautiful days for Bono.  Distraught over the death of his father, livid over the African AIDS crisis, and disappointed by the violent 9-11 world, Bono is no longer singing about tuna fleets clearing the sea out.  Yet like the man who lost his hearing and then composed the most joyful piece of music ever, U2 responds to adversity by affirming the indomitable human spirit. <br /> <br />The album is ignited by \\"Vertigo,\\" a \\"Zoo Station\\"/\\"Elevation\\" throw-away that seeks to remind listeners that the boys- er 43 year-old men- can still rock out.  The tone changes dramatically in the next two songs- both presumably about Bono's father.   In \\"Miracle Drug,\\" Bono prays for a cure.  Those who have felt powerless while visiting a sick loved one can relate: \\"The songs are in your eyes.  I see them when you smile.\\"  And yet Bono is not giving up.  Why? Because \\"of science and the human heart there is no limit.\\"  In \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own,\\" which he sang at his father's funeral, Bono wails: \\"Can-you-hear- me -when-I- sing? You're the reason I sing.  You're the reason why the opera is in me.\\" Accompanied by Edge's soaring guitars, one is reminded of Tom Hanks' opera scene in \\"Philadelphia.\\"   <br /> <br />From death we go to birth. \\"Original of the Species\\" is a gorgeous melodic piece.  \\"All Because of You,\\" which sounds like a lost track from \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" is sure to be a crowd pleaser in concert.  \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is a tad trite and impersonal- peace in the Middle East is clearly not Bono's cause celebre.  That we find in \\"Crumbs From Your Table,\\" where Bono shares his own experiences helping AfricanAIDS patients:  \\"Three to a bed.  Sister Ann, she said.  Dignity passes by.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is the money song.  It is the \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" the \\"One,\\" the \\"Walk On,\\"- but it most resembles \\"New Years Day.\\"  Again, the song opens with Edge on the piano.  Again, the song has political overtones- \\"New Years Day\\" was about the Soviet domination of Poland; \\"City\\" is about New York's loss of innocence after 9-11.  Yet the beauty in both songs lies in their powerful, personal choruses.  In \\"New Year's Day,\\" few of us thought about Lech Walesa when Bono sang \\"I want to be with you, be with you night and day.\\"  Similarly, none of us envision Giuliani when Bono croons \\"Oh you look so beautiful tonight.\\"  Instead, our thoughts turn to our lover- what we always think but often fail to say to her just before we dim the lights. <br /> <br />1983 was the last time that U2 concluded an album on an optimistic note.  Fans still chant the lyrics to War's \\"40\\" at the end of concerts.  Achtung's \\"Love is Blindness,\\" Pop's \\"Wake up Dead Man,\\" and All That You Can't Leave Behind's \\"Grace\\" are all dark, somber tunes that made me want to jump off of a cliff.  As I listened to \\"One Step Closer,\\" another downer, I feared that this was the album's conclusion.  Luckily, it is not.  Instead, U2 closes with \\"Yahweh,\\" Bono's passionate plea for G-d to help him become a better man.  Whether confessing one's sins in a church or atoning for them in a synagogue, all of us have asked the Lord \\"Take this mouth.  So quick to criticize.  Take this mouth.  Give it a kiss.\\"  The song and the album end with Bono assuring us of a brighter tomorrow:  \\"The sun is coming up on the ocean.  This love is like a drop in the ocean.\\" <br /> <br />When I exited my car, I found myself shouting in the dark morning.  \\"Yahweh!!!!   Yahweh!!!\\"  Had I lost my mind?  Was I ready to join the Promise Keepers?  No.  \\"Take this soul.  And make it sing.\\"  U2 have again made my soul sing. <br />
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I grabbed this album with much skepticism. People have been DROOLING over the mo-fo. Pitchfork has rated it as the best album of the year so far (9.7 out of 10), and I have heard a lot of talk about it being the album of the decade. I, being an admitted (albeit mild) music snob, automatically scoffed. Damn the man if this thing didn't win me over in just a few songs. Though it is a far cry from the best album of the decade, it is most of the other things people are saying about it: heartbreaking, cinematic, beautiful, baffling in it's ability to take simplicity and let it infect the songs with a sort of patience and, what? maturity? that few debut albums posess. For fans of \\"emo\\" music, this should be the standard...it is really truly an album about and saturated in emotion, not a \\"genre.\\" For those who freak out cause you are no longer \\"emo,\\" but \\"indie,\\" don't stick your nose up yet, this doesn't sound like any \\"emo\\" you have heard before. And it isn't depressing. It's sad and heartbreaking in subject and infectious in sound.
B000084T18|1.0|Come on now. This guy has the most horrible flow, godawful lyrics, and [...]I've ever heard. I honestly can't believe some of you find this GOOD. My god, I could run lyrical circles around this guy any day, any time. [...]
B0001MDP3G|4.0|For me, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain proved to be the best big studio release of the year (as well as one of the most criticized). This Civil War epic does an excellent job of portraying war as something that effects everyone involved in a purely negative way.  <br />  <br />Almost Homeric in it's presentation, Cold Mountain tells the story of a man and a woman torn apart by war. The majority of the film is dedicated to the struggles (brought on by war times) of the leading man as he tries to make his way back to his \\"ain true love.\\"  <br />  <br />For a Civil War movie, many will be surprised at how it glazes over huge issues such as race or even showing real battles, but this was never the point of the movie. Any war is brutal. From the Civil War to the War in Iraq, wartime's affect all who are involved in a very brutal way. Cold Mountain knows this and creates an atmosphere of true sadness at what war really means for everyone (not just the men fighting).  <br />  <br />Few times a year does a movie of such size contain a cast that is on fire through and through. Every single actor in this film (from the Oscar winning performance from Renee Zellweger, the breakout lead male performance of Jude Law, to Philip Seymour Hoffman, to a movie stealing scene with Natalie Portman) simply shines the whole time they are on screen. In fact, Cold Mountain clearly delights in it's small scenes and minor characters so much that the movie never sags under its own weight. Tragically and beautifully constructed, Cold Mountain is an excellent display of crafty film making.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I don't see why this movie has to be interpreted as feministic.  All traditions face turning points at which they may or may not change.  Those turning points may come from outside the tradition, or evolve it from within.  WHALE RIDER explores the painful process of a tradition going through both sorts of change.  It happens to turn on the question of whether the old school can accept a girl in a boy's traditional role, but I think it's more about tradition in general than about sex roles per se.  It also has a significant theme about difficult love within a family.  I guess I'm one of the simplistic dullards one reviewer refers to who were caught up in this film, from the early metaphor of the broken rope on the outboard motor, right through the ending.  I found the acting terrific and the characterization fine.  All of the characters grow and find their own relationship to the tradition.  It's an excellent movie.
B00005JMEW|4.0|I'll admit it. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a film for film lovers all the way through its core. Its a `movie for guys who likes movies,' if you will. I'll also be the first to admit that I didn't catch 3/4ths of the references to the film and television programs that Tarantino is paying homage to in this delightfully tacky and lovingly geeky story. One thing is certain though. Tarantino has seen more post-Kurosawa samurai films, spaghetti westerns, and anime features then the disembodied limbs he has spewing from every minute of Kill Bill - and he LOVES them. Judging by how much fun I had watching Kill Bill Vol. 1, I am inclined to think that I, too, just may be a bigger geek than my suave ways indicate.  <br />  <br />The thing that is so brilliant about Kill Bill is that it is so unabashedly indulgent, so completely full of ultra-cool style and highly imaginative cinematography, that it is nearly impossible to share in its joy. The film itself proves that content does not always have to outweigh style. In fact, style can itself be content. <br />  <br />Yes, its true, many will be offended by this wildly grotesque and intensely violent film. Understandably so, I say. There is far more blood in Kill Bill then there are false endings in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. But the movie is placed into such an intense fantasy world, it is hard to imagine it actually happening to real people in real time. Still, those that suspect that they will be offended probably will, and should steer clear.   <br />  <br />However, those that find this movie intriguing should take the plunge. Its dizzying, witty, and beautiful in its own `Tarantino-esque' way. Not to mention a soundtrack to disembowel all others this year featuring cheesy and hyper fight tracks and a moody and crooning Nancy Sinatra. Come to think of it, Sinatra's \\"Bang Bang (my baby shot me down),\\" over the opening titles gives the perfect feel for the film as a whole. If the first 2 minutes excite you, then you're in for a ride. If the first 2 minutes leave you feeling agitated, you might want to consider finding a more calm way to spend an hour and a half. Hey, at least you won't have to worry about paying late fees on the rental.  <br />
1402581386|2.0|I won't bother repeating the basic plot of this story - the other reviewers have done a fine job of that, but I have to add my two cents.  I agree that this plot idea was unusual, interesting and a great idea.  I got a recommendation from Amazon on this one and was excited by the story idea.  I put a hold on the audio version at my local library so I could get to it as soon as possible and got started listening to it with great expectations. The first chapter was pretty good.<br /><br />But, then the disappointment set in.  If this story could have been pitched to a great writer, who then ran with it, it may have been masterful, but Mr. Lindsay's writing is very remedial and even tiresome after a while.  I really had hoped that Dexter's use of alliteration would end at some point, but it didn't.  Although, the memories of his \\"father\\" were interesting and well-written, Dexter's sister Deb's character was a huge disappointment because even though Dexter talked about how smart she was & how she was going to be a great cop, she was written as incredibly dimwitted and whiny.  Most of the characters were flat, unimaginative, and banal. By the 5th of 7 disks, I was feeling impatience and wishing it would be over.  But, I didn't stop listening, so that says something.<br /><br />The story idea was great, even ingenious, the narration was very good, but the writing really fell flat.  If this is a series of books that he continues with, it's possible that his writing will improve and the subsequent books will be better, but this one was truly a disappointment.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|\\"Being lonely never felt so cool.\\" That is how one viewer put the experience of watching Lost in Translation to words. That is just what it is - a dizzying, beautiful, and...yes, cool depiction of being lonely in a big city.  <br />  <br />The story involves an aging, washed up actor, and the young, neglected wife of a fashion photographer.They meet in a Tokyo hotel lounge and hit it off immediately. They laugh, they talk, they seem to fill each others void - seem to understand one another. A lesser movie would quickly turn this into the obligatory romance, but Lost in Translation is more mature. It understands the complexities of the human need for companionship, and that this need works on many more levels than a Hollywood clich. This relationship is what makes Lost in Translation so compelling. These two people need each other so deeply, so immediately, in a way that registers to everyone. That need it is something that transcends romance, friendship, acquaintance, and every other box one could place human contact in. Sophia Coppola has captured these nuances and complexities to such a subtle and beautiful tee, that this is a film that stays with you and lingers for days - even weeks - after the first viewing. <br /> <br /> To top that off, Bill Murray offers his career's best performance. This is an amazing performance, given by a real pro. Murray plays a role that is far more complicated than it appears. He is a funny man, a man who knows he has a natural comedic talent...but has lost something. He no longer feels the need to try so hard...he is holding back. This is an infinitely perceptive Murray and every minute he is on screen, he had my rapt attention. <br /> <br />Scarlette Johanason proved to be the only match for Murray minute by minute in this performance that shows that she is quite possibly the next great female lead of my generation.  <br /> <br /> Lost in Translation has amazing staying power and proves to be a real treat for anyone who gives it achance. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|Like almost ALL U2 CDs, I hated all the songs immediately!! But they have a strange way of growing on you and I can honestly say I am totally happy with this CD. <br />If you have been a fan of U2 for a while this CD will not dissapoint. <br />What WAS strange however is some the guitar riffs and vocals reminded me so much of BOY and WAR. What WAS cool though is that this CD comes with a DVD. If you watch it (22 minutes) they explain how many of these songs were written 20 years ago but were not totally ready (polished).<br />\\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Original Of The Species\\" are amazing and any true U2 fan will like them.<br />I would describe this CD as a cross between \\"An Cat Dubh\\" and \\"Elevation\\". Overall 5 stars all the way
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My favorite movie of 2004.  Give this one a try and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  There is something for everyone in this star-studded film.  Recipe for relaxing night: this movie, one couch, two big pillows, a blanket, and your significant other.
B000002L7R|5.0|I remember how excited I was to get this cassette tape the day it was released.  My boyfriend and I were going to a friend's house, and as Mark was a fan, too, we listened to it in his 69 Rally Sport Camaro.  After it was over, he looked at me with his \\"what the h--l was that?\\" expression, while I sat, with a blissful look on my face.  He wasn't a fan after that day.  I was even more enraptured with Prince than ever.  (I knew then that the relationship with my boyfriend was doomed.)  Throughout the years, the cassette stayed in my collection.  I loved loved loved Pop Life-- as AIDS was really making news in those days, the song held great significance then.  Around the World In A Day and Paisley Park were favorite driving songs, ones that helped when I was sitting in stop n go traffic here in Houston.  America was, and still is, a staple on my running tape, now CD.   <br />And Raspberry Beret?  I tired of its constant repetitiveness on the radio at the time, but as it introduced my DAD to Prince's music--before, he was blinded by the sexually suggestive posters on my wall, prejudiced by the news coverage and controversy regarding his stage show and lyrics, and deafened by the rantings and ravings of Tipper Gore and her PMRC to actually sit and give the music a listen--and now he is a fan as well.  His 2nd favorite song by Prince?  Cream!! <br />Anyway, ATWIAD opened my 19 year old mind and enabled me to be more flexible when it came to my favorite artists expanding their style.  Now, I'll listen to a CD three or four times before actually passing judgement, and you know what?  Rarely, if ever, have I discarded any CD since.
037542217X|4.0|I'm a neophyte to this series. I guess I walked into the middle of the party, since The Typing School is number 4 of 7, to date. This book was easy reading, comforting, polite, and harking back to another less nasty age of human interaction. No grisly murders or inhuman brutality going on here. Not much crime either. But we have a strong moral compass monitoring the daily melodramas of life in the well-drawn person of Precious Romotswe, and we have an exotic backdrop of Botswana, which is described with precision as a lovely wayside stop in paradise that is slowly caving in to the vagaries of \\"modern\\" behavior (read rudeness).<br /><br />I really liked the Typing School and recommend it as a pleasant resting place between more meaty fare. I also can see how indulging in such bon mots and straightforward writing found here can become habit-forming.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Soooo disapointing. <br /> <br />I was expecting more, but this was a poorly made movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Critics liken it what Sgt Peppers was to the Beatles.  Every song is great.  The thing to remember that it is an album that is meant to be listened to entirely - straight through.  If you do this you'll notice that it moves to each song effortlessly.  It's a listening experience and the breakthrough for GD is that it expands their musical repertoire and shows that they are not just another fly-by-night punk band, but a creative force that will stand the test of time.
B00003CXIP|4.0|its an awesome movie to watch especially if you're a kidbut it also can be for older people. i like how it revolves around friendship and the virtues of growing up. i also reccomend reading the book, its a good read.
B00030590I|5.0|This is the most beautiful, artistic \\"action\\" movie of the year. Poetry in motion. Totalitarinism never looked so good.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan for as long as I have been listening to music. This album is definately something new for Green Day. They seem to have moved on from the basic 4 chord songs. They have always sounded great though, with their unique riffs using basic chords. This album brings a new meaning to Green Day. It is a different listening from say, Dookie, or International Superhits, but in a better way. Their song, \\"American Idiot\\" shouldn't be the most played song from this album however. All the songs are great. Boulevard of Broken Dreams (although that song is widely known too), Holiday, Are We Waiting, Extraordinary Girl, they're all great songs.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD to anyone looking to buy ANYTHING from Green Day!
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|Ian Anderson has delivered what is the best Holiday set of music this side of Bruce Cockburn and Emmylou Harris. Along with his bandmates, the CD and the accompanying DVD, present the time of year with a distinctive English feel. Perhaps it is an England gone now to the force of globalization, but be it his sardonic liner notes or the dramatically re-worked Tull and Christmas chestnuts that he is roasting, the music herein lives with a sense of passion about the need for what a winter solstice brings to the soul. I daresay I like this version of \\"Christmas  Song\\" and \\"Ring out Solstice Bells\\" even better than the originals. <br />I'd say this is essential holiday mischief making, and you'd have expect Ian to come round as a wren boy. The gratias at the end of the notes are comical: nearly everyone thanks the instrument manufacturers and so you can not help but wonder if there isn't a tongue out of flute and firmly in cheek, like thanking the manufacturers for the toys. All except Dave Pegg, God Bless him, who thanks \\"his lucky stars and everyone.\\"  <br />Indeed.
B000002H97|2.0|I recall when this CD first came out how it appealed to the masses. It even appealed to people who were never into any type of metal music before. <br /> <br />I admit, I was one of those people who rushed out to buy it when it first came out. I was in anticipation of what it would be like. Boy, was I dissapointed!!! If you all noticed most people who prefer Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets (including myself) are the most critical of the Black album and all of Metalica's releases following it. Where is the music? The passion? The excitement? RTL and MOP are so great they are not even reviewable. They are indescribable to say the least.  Try the following experiment: If you have all three, first play either RTL or MOP, then play the Black CD right after it. You will see what I mean. Also, notice all CD's up until this one had an instrumental on them. Instrumentals are a lot harder to present to people. The music has to be beautiful (Call Of Katula, Orion, To Live Is To Die). It takes a lot more effort to do this. I feel starting from the black album Metalica either lost interest or ran out of ideas, or were simply out to make tons of money without caring what it would sound like as long as it appealed to the masses. Of course, the passing of Cliff Burton (RIP, Cliff) had a lot to do with this also. For the most part he was Metalica as we once knew them. There are some songs on Black that are very catchy (Enter Sandman, Sad, But True), however, this does not mean it is a good CD. <br /> <br />Best songs - Of Wolf And Man, However I May Roam, God That Failed, Holier Than Thou <br />Worst Songs - Don't Tread On Me <br />Most Commercialized Songs - Enter Sandman, Sad, But True, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters <br /> <br />Ratings Explained - I deducted one star for boredom, one star for lack of creativity, and another star for them pissing me off.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Before I started watching the Gilmore Girls I was a pretty loyal 7th Heaven viewer, However thinking back it wasn't too realistic of a show. I'm sure there is no family in the world that is like that family. However the Gilmore Girls on the other-hand is pretty realistic. As a matter of fact me and my mom used to be alot like Rory and her mom. So I was instantly hooked. So when I couldn't watch all of the episodes I had to purchase the box set. And I definately didn't regret it. It made me laugh and cry and get angry all of the attributes of a GREAT show. So I watched the whole thing as soon as I got it, and cannot wait to get the 2nd season!
B000066NW0|3.0|I've owned this cd since it first came out and love it. With songs like \\"Unwanted\\" that is a athem for anyone who has all ways been the outkast. and \\"St8er Boi\\", \\"Complcated\\", and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" that you can't help but sing along to. The only reason I giving this 3 stars is because she is just acting a little to immature. Her new one is one of the best CDs I own and trust me I own a lot of them.
B000050XEI|5.0|Words cannot even describe this magnum opus. Enya blew me and many others away with her debut album, Watermark, and now she does it again. A Day Without Rain compiles her talents into one work and contains varieties in instruments, language, and mood. With hundreds of reviews and countless praise, more people are discovering Enya and her talents. I can't really choose a track and say it is the best; each one is different in tone and mood. Therefore, her work is unpredictable. Her music evokes a colorful world of peace and joy, and at the same time, relieves tension and stress. With so many people deeply affected by her music, it is no wonder that A Day Without Rain is such a popular title in the New-Age genre.
0393312836|5.0|I can easily rate this book the best I have ever read. Although this novel covers a very dark, terrible topic, it is joyful in a sense. I say this, because the narrarator writes and speaks with such a bouncy tone, expressing bad events as \\"a real horror show\\" and swears as \\"grahzny\\" and \\"vonny.\\" He regards himself as \\"your humble narrarator although he is really a psychotic terrible person. Some people might find this book just terrible and disgusting, but overall through the book, you realize just hpw bad ultra-violence is. The plainly bizzare plot hooks you and although really confusingly written, you will understand. Anthony Burgess writtens with many confusing words, but it is fun just to figure out what the words mean. I recommend this book to whoever envies strang plots and loves to read. If you find it slow, just stick with it and you will become the character in the book, feel his pain and suffering.
B000001ESF|5.0|Well, Rush's third-time's-a-charm album \\"2112\\" ain't aspic, but it sure gels! (Thanks for that line, Martin Balsam). Released three years after their initial offering -- which featured a different drummer and a host of Zeppelin knockoffs -- \\"2112\\" represents the first cohesive effort by the Canadian trio and a bridge between their early albums and their finely-tuned concept albums \\"A Farewell to Kings,\\" \\"Hemispheres\\" and \\"Permanent Waves.\\"    This is certainly not their first foray into the \\"concept album\\" genre, which Spinal Tap so aptly mocked with \\"Rock 'n Roll Creation\\" and \\"Stonehenge,\\" but it is Rush's most thought-out.     On their second album, \\"Fly By Night,\\" which marked lyricist and stellar percussionist Neil Peart's arrival, the band featured an overture-length tune in \\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog,\\" sort of a progressive rock dueling banjos. Their third album, \\"Caress of Steel,\\" featured two Dungeons & Dragons' Lair extended cantatas, \\"The Fountain of Lamneth\\" and \\"The Necromancer,\\" two compositions more akin to Ronnie James Dio's band Elf than what listeners would later expect to hear from Rush.    Yet, with \\"2112,\\" their magnum opus in the rock opera genre, Rush fully flowered in the concept rock arena as their own men. Loosely based on Ayn Rand's dystopic novella \\"Anthem,\\" \\"2112\\" is a story about a lone man who rediscovers instrumental music (he unearths a guitar, abandoned eons before his arrival) in an age of nameless, faceless corporate computerized music (Peart gave mankind too much credit: He could have easily called the album \\"2004\\" and still have been dead-on).    The trio's musicianship really stands out, cut after cut: Geddy Lee's coloratura soprano rages out your speaker cones accompanied by his rock-steady bass and layered keyboards; Alex Lifeson gets in some pretty killer licks and Bach-rock riffs; Neil Peart's drumming is awesome, full of \\"how'd he do that\\" blizzards of percussion and provides the glue that holds this record together.    Theflipside has some nice songs as well, particularly the melancholic \\"Tears,\\" which was written by Geddy and Peart's \\"Something for Nothing,\\" an ode to self-reliance. Who else but Rush could distill a basic economic premise from the Chicago School and turn it into a hard-rocking anthem?
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I scratched my head the first time I heard it... almost like a lot of different albums. \\"Fans\\" get so caught up in the greatest hits of an artist that they see anything straying from this in any way as horrible and immediatley bellow \\"HOW COULD YOU? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???!!!\\"<br /><br />Neil Young has made his far share of \\"hits\\". If he wanted to rehash all of his old stuff and cash in, he'd simply go on tour and put out countless \\"Neil Freezes over\\", \\"Steel Neils\\", \\"Neilfest 285\\"  and \\"This really is my last concert, I know I said that 10 years ago but i need a new yacht 2004\\" concert DVD's and CDs. Notice, the DVD was free... not everbody does that.<br /><br />Greendale is an album that likely struck Neil as a novel idea and he chose to weave it together with several elements that have been grating agaisnt him for a long time. Many of the tunes are simplistic, but some are timeless Neil Young. This is not a mindless \\"stick it in your CD player and get some background noise\\" CD. it's like skimming over Kafka for a bit of light reading, you have to pay attetion and be ready to think a little bit.<br /><br />I applaud his efforts and am glad that he doesn't make music for his \\"fans\\" and instead makes music because it is what he wakes up thinking about, and is happy that a few appreciate it and could care less about the nay sayers.<br /><br />Much thanks Neil.
B000687M48|4.0|This is a very good live performance, with Amy Lee showing her powerful vocals and all she learned about stage performance lately. Also, the departure of Ben Goody did not seem to have affected the band at all. The only thing that anoys me about this DVD/CD is the excess of pre-recorded parts. All backing vocals, choir, string and electronic keyboard parts are on playback. It just does not fit with a live stage performance. At some points, it looks like a big karaoke session, where nobody but machines are playing and Amy Lee is singing over it. With all the success the band has been enjoying, they could have afforded real backing vocals, real choir and a real keyboardist, leaving only the drum machine and sound effects for machines to do. It would have looked and sounded so much better! Well, maybe in the next time! For the rest, the band plays well and no major mistakes were made. That's why I gave them 4 stars. There is one \\"new\\" studio track, \\"Missing\\", that is a remarkable song. I can't understand why it did not make it to the album Fallen.
B00009TB5G|5.0|One of the things I love about the LOTR series is it's ability to captivate people who previously were unable to fathom the appeal of fantasy.  People like my dad and sister, for example.  You don't have to read the books (although they're great too), you don't have to be into fantasy novels.  All you need is an acute sense of justice, beauty and imagination.  I have seen these movies appeal to jocks, activists, computer geeks, artists, soccer moms, and old men, as well as all races, genders, sexual orientations, income levels, and countries of origin.  The movies seem to appeal to us on a visceral level, hearkening back to some imaginary time everyone seems to remember when things were purer and less complicated, and good and evil were palpable, tangible things more easily understood. <br /> <br />Peter Jackson saw that Tolkein, in the tradition of Shakespere, had distilled Western Civilisation (what's left of it anyhow) and human desire into a kind of fable epic, a fairy-tale novel without allegory or trite moralisation, and he wanted to bring it to life in a way unparallelled by anything that we have yet seen or heard tell of.  What's more, he wanted to do so in a way that would unselfishly share the beauty of the stories with everyone willing to invest the time while staying true to the source material. <br /> <br />If you have seen these movies, and are curious as to how they could possibly have been made, then I would suggest that you put aside some time, perhaps if you get the flu, or find yourself snowed in, or just an afternoon free, pop yourself some corn, nestle in a warm blanket, and watch all six hours of the documentary film footage.  Being a film buff, I have already done this and found it to be one of the most enjoyable and inspiring experiences of my life.  I could imagine, however, that some may be daunted by the idea of spending half a day sitting down doing anything, let alone watching documentary film footage about anything. <br />If this is thecase, then you can always watch each thirty to fifty minute portion separately over several days, which, while less awe inspiring, might also be less intimidating. <br /> <br />Some of the things covered in the documenary include; how they adapted the book and why they left things out or added things, storyboarding, art direction, casting, music and sound effects, digital grading, props, and CGI, just to name a few.  Even if you have just a passing interest in the Lord of the Rings, but love learning how movies are made, or are just creative and are inspired by mammouth achievements, give it a gander, and you won't be dissappointed.  In the Two Towers, my absolute favorite part was them showing how Gollum was created.  This section is split up into three parts, which take about an hour and a half to watch. <br /> <br />It's easy to say, \\"Go and watch it,\\" but in all likelyhood, your local video store doesn't have the extended version DVD of all three of the LOTR movies, if they have any.  If you're like me, and you have several friends who are into it, you might be able to borrow it from them, but then you might not have a DVD player, in which case I am sorry for you (actually, I had to watch it at my dad's, as my DVD player is broken).  I saw it first by borrowing the first two box sets from my friend, who was borrowing them from her brother, and spent twelve happy hours over several days watching every single feature about how everything in the movie was done.  Then my friend's brother wanted them back (my friend never did get to watch the documentary), so I had to buy them myself.  It was well worth it.
B0002YLC24|5.0|No, this movie and BEFORE SUNRISE is not for the \\"young\\" and Sci-fi, special effects crowd.  It wasn't meant to be either.  If you like lots of effects, quick cutting, action, bombings and other disasters...STAY AWAY.  But if you want an intellegent movie with honest to goodness dialogue, then give this and BEFORE SUNRISE a try. You must see SUNRISE first.  What a charming and not-so-perfect pair of real people portrayed here.  Ethan Hawke has never been better and Julie Deply is sensational.  The movie is worth the price of rental or sale for the last 8 minutes alone.  Deplys song she sings for Hawke is unforgetable as is her Nina Simone imitation.  I sat through these last moments countless times.  And the last two lines are the best I've heard in years and years of seeing movies.  If AFI had a show on best \\"last liners\\", SUNSET would win hands down.  A MUST SEE for people with brains, intellect, and love of film.  Again, not for the Special effect buffs and all the crazy type of Hollywood movies being made today.
B000002HMH|4.0|Although I would like to call myself a Metallica \\"purest\\" I disagree with that group in that this was a terrible album.  I love old Metallica, their fast paced headbanging anthems and screaming guitar solos, but the fact is this album is not as bad as other fans would have you think.  While it is far from what we usually think of as Metallica, it's still not that bad.  When you listen to it, you need to not think of it as thrash like their old stuff.  This is modern rock, more alike to Nirvana, Staind, Creed and Stone Temple Pilots than Slayer and Megadeth which their old stuff was like.  When you listen to it that way, it's pretty good, just don't think about the other cds while you listen.  This an album you should get and listen to while you read a book.  It's great music to listen to while reading, but if you're really going to listen, go with Master of Puppets or RIde the Lightning.
0780624890|3.0|\\"Blade\\" absolutely looks great.  It is as well paced as any action film I've seen in a long time.  It's lots of fun to watch and cheer for Mr. Smooth, Wesley Snipes, in his role as comic book hero Blade, a half-vampire on the side of humanity in a war against the undead that we mortals are blissfully unaware of.  Most of the ladies in this film are absolutely gorgeous, and the sets, cinematography, and special effects are all first-rate. <br /> <br />I just wish they would've told us more of what's going on here. <br /> <br />Let's see, there's something about a blood god, some underground facility for calling him into being, an ancient \\"vampire Bible,\\" and several important characters whose backstories, like any details regarding the above critical items, are apparently too unimportant to take screen time away from the action. <br /> <br />As with any flick of this type, some of the dialogue is dreadful, so that's not a real problem for me except that it detracts from the viewer being really involved with the characters.  It's the lack of a cohesive story that bothers me, as half the time I wasn't sure why anybody was doing what they were doing, except that we know it's a good thing to kill vampires and keep them from feeding on us. <br /> <br />It's an action flick for the Nintendo generation, which I guess is part of why its appeal is limited for an old non-videogame fart like me.  Much of the action looks exactly like it was lifted from a \\"Mortal Kombat\\" type game, so it's really sanitized and way too tidy.  In the film's ultrabloody climax, for example, Blade himself doesn't get a drop on his silver-clad uniform or even, apparently, on his superfast hands.  Oh, a bit gets on his sword, since he has after all been hacking his way through an army of vampires.  (They come at him one at a time, of course, while the others stand and wait their turn instead of ganging up and overpowering him as a group.  Ah, Hollywood.)  Also Snipes' performance, although generally effective, is basically a two-note job:  Angry and angrier.  Can you say \\"range\\"?  We know Snipes has it, based on his other films.  It's not on display here at all. <br /> <br />In spite of its shortcomings, though, \\"Blade\\" succeeds as mindless fun, suitable for anyone who doesn't mind rivers of blood (mostly vampire blood) cascading through their cathode ray tubes or the plasma equivalent thereof.  \\"Biscuit Boy,\\" who makes Jabba the Hut look like a recent Weight Watchers graduate, is especially fun to see. <br /> <br />I just wish I had been given some details on what the plot was.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Well I wasn't planning on writing a review until I saw a review by some dumb kid who said that Iron Maiden had ripped off Papa Roach, so before i start reviewing RiB I'd like to talk to that kid and anyone else like him:  YOU ARE A DUMBASS!  Apart from being nowhere as good as Iron Maiden, Papa Roach was too young to hold a guitar when Iron Maiden had already had about 8 top albums!  Also you said that if you wanted metal you'd listen to Spice Girls or something like that.  What the f--- is that about?  I won't insult people for their taste in music (you mentioned how 50 Cent had more talent than Slayer) but, umm, Spice Girls? <br />Now that that's cleared up, about Reign in Blood.  This is without question the best thrash metal album of all time.  It's only competition is Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss and Metallica's Master of Puppets.  It starts out with \\"Angel of Death,\\" a haunting classic about the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele and what he did to people at Auschwitz.  I was so pissed that they didn't play this at Ozzfest, it's one of their best, 10/10! After that it doesn't let go of you for about half an hour.  Their dualing guitars of King and Hanneman fly through the cd at 200 mph with incredible riffs and scrreaming solos.  As in most Slayer albums it's best two songs are the first and last, and \\"Raining Blood\\" is a perfect closer.  I love how Postmortem ends with the rain that builds into \\"Raining Blood,\\" an incredible closing song with a great intro, and ends in my favorite words for the end of an album, \\"Now I shall reign in blood!\\"   <br />The bonus tracks, \\"Agressive Perfector,\\" and \\"Crimally Insane(Remix)\\" are both very good also, however, Raining Blood is a better way to end the album.  This is an album that every heavy metal fan should buy... in fact you already should have it!  No get out there and buy it fast! <br />
B00012QM8G|1.0|This film is very empty, for not only does it portray the Germans as \\"evil, lop-sided, devil worshippers\\" but it shows the Jews as being \\"promising, alluring, good guys\\". If one is to question morality, then do so, but do not give us the black vs white issue found in this film. Speilberg, immature since day one as director, tells us what to think, he strips away our humanity by overdosing us on excessive amounts of guilt and sentimentality. In effect, the film lacks any moral basis except to denounce all evil men and with that, we learn absolutely nothing.....
B0002IU988|4.0|I was disappointed when I heard that Creed had broken up because their music was very good (whatever may be said about some of the distractions with either their popularity or \\"good guy\\" image).  When I heard that the \\"band\\" and Stapp would each be coming out with new albums, I was eager to hear what they had to offer.  Whatever the future may hold for Stapp, and I am not terribly optimistic, Alter Bridge's \\"One Day Remains\\" is simply a phenomenal rock record.    The new lead singer, Myles Kennedy, is a top-quality vocalist.  I think that was a problem with Creed.  I enjoyed Stapp's lyrics - I found them deeply emotional, personal, and meaningful.  But Stapp was not a remarkable vocal talent.  He had the baritone sound embraced in the 90's and 00's, but he was not a powerful singer.  He was better in the studio where he could get help.  Often his live vocals were subpar.  He didn't have much range.  Goodness knows the same cannot be said for Kennedy.  He has a tremendous voice.  His range is out of this world.  He is a fantastic lead for the band.  I read some other reviewers complaining about his \\"ohs\\" and the like.  I actually find it appealing that, as the others play their instruments, he uses his voice in similar fashion.  That seems like what being a vocalist is all about (not that he doesn't play guitar as well).    Aside from the vocals, Tremonti's guitar has never sounded better.  The same can be said for the rest of the guys.  While the lyrics are very good, I do feel they are a little weaker than Stapp's.  Nonetheless I think Tremonti did quite well in his own right.    The band recorded a good balance of hard rocking tunes and more melodic pieces (which are often my favorites: \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Down to My Last\\", \\"Shed My Skin\\", and \\"The End is Near\\").  Whether as Creed or Alter Bridge, these guys have a gift for creating catchy tunes.  All the tracks are quite good.  I didn't feel anything was just thrown in.  Of course, as with any music, we all have our tastes and some will appeal more than others.    I heartily encourage you to give it a listen.  It is a great record.
B00005JLPK|2.0|After hearing about all the grandeur that this film would convey, I was looking forward to seeing the attempt to put the life of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo onto the screen but I also came in with healthy skepticism. This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />It was an understatement to say that this was pure \\"torture\\" to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a \\"hero and martyr\\" and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film. Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion.<br /><br />Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina).<br /><br />Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most \\"famous\\" episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations. She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied. Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work.<br /><br />Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here. If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look. This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this. After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs. What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this \\"brilliant and wonderful\\". I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible. This film was not even worth making it is so bad.een.

B000056NX5|2.0|When I had the opportunity to see the reworked JCS, I was eager to take advantage.  I had found the dusty desert with little to no staging from the 70's version a little unnerving.  In addition to the background, some of the vocal ranges were, shall we say, unusual - of course, blame Webber and Rice for this, I guess.  After time, though, the voices of Jesus and Judas simply won me over.  Judas was phenomenal.  Anyway, I was anxious to try the new.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed after seeing the production.  I say a \\"little\\" because I tried really hard to appreciate the novelty.  But after repeated viewings, all I can say is that I personally feel this production is horrible.<br /><br />The 70's Jesus was so small and frail it was troubling at first.  Ultimately his powerful voice and raw emotion won me over.  This Jesus never could win me over.  He seemed weak and was pushed around - literally (not by the Pharisees or Romans as you'd expect, but by Judas).  And speaking of Judas... Poor fellow.  Poor, poor Judas.  He absolutley cannot reach the notes.  I am sure he has a good voice, but most of what is heard here is the poor guy straining for all he's worth.  He is emotive, but I think that may be the head rush from clinching every muscle he has to try to hit the notes.<br /><br />I do believe the pharisees were better in the new production - even if some of their acting was a little disconcerting.  The disciples were pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Mary was okay.<br /><br />I had hoped the staging would be a welcome change form the old version, but I just didn't feel it fit the piece.  I could never buy in.<br /><br />Obviously many disagree, but my earnest suggestion is that you stick with the standard edition from the 70's if you want JCS.  With the sparse production value, you can focus on the talent of the actors.  The new version has nothing to offer - in worthwhile staging or vocal talent.
B00007BK2N|1.0|This movie, or whatever it entails itself to be, is nothing but a collection of small parts that make it totally unreliable. It is so boring, that one not only begins to hate British, because they are portrayed as chain smoking, cussing, prostitute visiting, sobs who do nothing but say the F word and sit on the cold sidewalk. The film was supposed to be about the Factory record label which signed up one of the best bands of all time, Joy Division but as the actors are so terrible, all we get is the Ian Curtis look alike who does nothing but prance around the stage all day pretending to look cool. This movie is not recommend to anyone at all because it isn't even a good tool for sleep.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Will have to buy another set of dvd's of this show, these will be worn out soon as I watch them over and over.  <br />Action-packed, funny, smart, dramatic- this show had everything except the backing of Fox Network. The characters are fun to watch, the stories are good, enough hints about deeper motives and bigger things to keep you interested without overwhelming the current action. <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|This film, beginning with the hacking of a child's arm in the time of the mythical figure of Christ, never is ashamed to bathe in disturbing, violent images. Directed by the ego-maniac who calls himself a 'true Christian' and yet advocates killing those not in line with his myopic views, Mel Gibson, a schizo if there ever was one, does not seem to know how to separate history from his half deluded gospel scenes. Most of the story centers around Christ, who was a fabricated martyr figure which history tells us did not really exist and his fictitious \\"crucifixion\\" which \\"saved man\\", but not obviously very well if you look at all the warfare since, especially by the Catholic Church. Avoid at all costs, unless you are a fanatical Christian.
B00008G8M4|1.0|Along with Reign of Fire and Star Wars ep1&2, this is the worst sci-fi film in the past 10 years. <br /> <br />The worst thing about it is that the masses think its good (there are lots of them out there after all) - but if you've got any taste, you'll hate it!!! <br /> <br />Stay clear of this tat - you have been warned!!!
B00005JKN9|1.0|This film pretends that it is historic, but it does not deal with history, at least not real history, what is portrayed in the film instead is amiable \\"hollywood-ization\\" of a marginal topic. Scorsese makes the gang wars more brutal than they were, perhaps resembling some choreographed knife fight at the local dance hall. I find it incredulous to believe that 600 drunk Irish hooligans were at each other's throats near the lower East side, there is no recorded document of the event, oh, he made it up to please the masses. How fun is it when a man gets an axe in the head, well, according to the director, very fun indeed. It is sick, not only that he uses a serious issue of race violence in early American urban landscapes, but he makes it look cartoon-like. I found the film too long, predictable, played by terrible actors in folly-like roles and the end is a complete disaster that no one can decipher. A below average piece of junk from a once mild director....
B00003Q43A|1.0|Along with Reign of Fire and Star Wars ep1&2, this is the worst sci-fi film in the past 10 years. <br /> <br />The hype before the film made it out to be an epic, rather than the formulaic disaster and b-movie mix. There was no intelligent plot and no decent action scenes - just dogs being saved (what a relief when the world is lying in ruins). <br /> <br />Will Smith was playing his fresh prince character as usual (but this time dressed as a pilot); Bill Pullman was completely miscast as an uncharismatic, boring, leader; Robert Loggia laughable as the general (he makes you think we'd be better of with a head of the brownies instead); to name a few. <br /> <br />Stay clear of this tat - you have been warned!!!
0156027321|5.0|This is an important book, especially in today's world where people are increasingly dismissing religion due to faults they see exhibited by extreme or fundamentalist groups (be they Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, etc.).  The world is changing, and the role of religion may be changing as well.  But it is ignorant to say that religion and mythology are no longer needed in modern society.  Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" puts in plain view those elements of our lives that can only be seen completey through the eyes of religion and myth. <br /> <br />Pi is an homage to the power of storytelling.  It re-kindles in its reader the idea that storytelling does not simply disclose the story itself but also, and sometimes more importantly, the teller. <br /> <br />The most recent story I can think of comparing this book to is the 2003 film \\"Big Fish\\".  If you liked that movie, I would bet that you will enjoy this book.  Both deal with the important question: Can't embellishments sometimes be closer to the point of telling us truths than dry facts alone?
B00006JDVV|1.0|The true tragedy is that I paid to watch this film in the cinema - what an unbelievable disapointment. Somebody should blacklist the director for actually managing to put people off going to the cinema. This should have been straight to video or maybe even cable. The only people who like this type of purile drivel are non-science fiction fans. I hate it when films are over-hyped to appeal to true genre fans but when you turn up you get a super-thin plot, bad acting, awful CGI, characters you really don't care about and 20 seconds of action. <br /> <br />Remember, just kill the main dragon and all the others will die too. Its simple. [sound of me puking up...]
B00004W50T|5.0|I still find it kind of scary that after all these years, this album continues to amaze me with its power and emotion. The way the 3 vocalists fight to get a line in, Robbie's so understated playing, and the mood is to this day unmatched.  \\"Astral Weeks\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" all rank in greatness, but Big Pink beats them all.  I wonder when I play it if they knew at the time of recording it that they had created arguably the greatest album of all time.  And I still can't make out the lyrics to \\"Chest Fever\\" after all these years. Hope I never do. <br /> <br />You (and everybody else) should own this masterpiece!
0061015725|3.0|Prey is a fast paced science fiction thriller based on a biological nanotechnology mistake which results in the potention end of life as we know it on earth. Michael Crichton has done it again, and produced a novel which is bound to become a movie some day. Similar in structure to Jurassic Park, Timeline, and The Lost World, Prey contains characters, situations and events that were just made for the big screen.<br /><br />In parts, the novel dragged on a bit - with long winded scientific descriptions that I found myself skimming over. These were usually sumarised in layman's terms at the end of the two pages of scientific mumbo-jumbo with comparisons to simple things like corn.<br /><br />There are a few references within the novel to a 'black cloak', which is never explained - and I still don't quite understand what it was all about.<br /><br />Overall, it was not a bad novel - but it's not Chrichton's best either. Good for someone wanting a fast read, with a positive message about the consequences of messing with nature.
B0000072KY|5.0|These F**kers need to fix this God forsakken site! I t just kicked me off of my own fricken review! I Hate you dumb f**ks! Just take my advice, if you like Nirvana, buy the imported complete versions of both Nevermind and In Utero&#60;this cd&#62; it makes the listen much more enjoyable, it like completes it! <br />And possibly invest in With the Lights Out, bought it the day it came out, man is it wicked awesome, I Love You Kurt, Rest in Piece, and if you listen to some stuff, Dave is a wicked drumemr, and Krist is a very good bass player as well, the whole band gets props for bein Nirvana, but still, Kurt, we love you man, you honored us with this cd, we love you man, Rest is Piece p.s. Heart Shaped Box is as good as Teen Spirit!
0061015725|5.0|The book, Prey, by Michael Crichton, is a science fiction novel.  With nano-parts moving like swarms, and attacking people, this book was very interesting.  Michael Crichton is a brilliant man when it comes to Science Fiction books.  The story was great making readers never want to put the book down.  Prey was so good, you thought you were actually with the people in the book, doing what they were doing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I will briefly comment on the beauty of this album.  Really, it would be a repeat of most other commentators.  The scores are catchy (even my gun-toting, sports-loving husband found himself humming the tune of \\"Popular\\" after listening to it with family one weekend) and the voices of Kristin and Idina are astounding and renowned with good reason.  Most seem to attract to Kristin, but I find the raw, realistic, almost pop-like vocals for her character of Elpheba are a welcome change from the typical broadway belting I usually hear. <br />But more than touting the values of this great (and VERY worthwhile CD) I wanted to write a review of the wonderful people at Amazon.  I tried ordering this same CD from another online ordering service that shall remain nameless (OK, OK, twist my arm it was OVERSTOCK.COM) and without boring everyone with a lot of nasty details, let's just say that TWO MONTHS LATER, I have yet to see either the CD OR the refund that I requested.  So, if anyone wanted to know, let me give you a little hint-- don't ever, ever, ever, EVER order media items from Overstock.  It was only the 2nd order I've ever placed with them, and I can promise, it will be my last.  But I have placed COUNTLESS orders with Amazon.com and STILL have yet to be disappointed with a purchase or shipment, or any aspect of ordering.  So BRAVO! to the people at Amazon and praises to their customer service abilities.  Maybe they should start selling some of their secrets to... (ahem) less than competent competitors. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I am blown away by this album.    Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, Original of the Species, & Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own will go down as some of the greatest songs in U2's career.  This album has all the ingredients of a classic U2 album - soaring epics, chiming guitar work, passionate vocals, deep themes.  I would disagree with saying it's ATYCLB part 2 (It's better)  It fits in well with all of U2's work and it sounds fresh at that.    Another note: many of the songs I disliked at first have grown on me majorly - best examples = One Step Closer & Yahweh.    Like most U2 albums this one will get better on every listen.    (also make sure to download Mercy, it's a B-Side for the album but single quality)
B00005Y228|3.0|The only tracks that stand out on Fever are \\"Love at First Sight,\\" \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" \\"Come Into My World,\\" and \\"In Your Eyes.\\"  At first, I really liked this cd.  However, after I listened to this album several times, I was sick of the music.
B00005JKN9|5.0|this was a good movie. based on the book Gangs of New York, anyone who isnt horrible inbred can see that it is historically accurate. though if you happen to be a member of the PMRC you may not appreciate this movie too much. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is incredible. i recommend this movie to anyone who isnt a little sissy and repulsed by blood.
B0006399FS|4.0|I am a huge U2 fan and I love everything they do. Bono's voice seems to make even the cheesiest of songs sound good and respectable. That takes an unsummountable amount of talent, and thats what makes Bono Bono. <br /> <br />Does this album deserve 4 stars? Probably not because they've produced more lingering and memorable songs. But I give U2 4 stars for this one because: <br /> <br />It's 2004, 25+ years after they hit the music scene, and they still command such respect and attention from everyone. <br /> <br />I love \\"Crumbs from your table\\". This is the U2 style of songs I like (U2 enthusiasts will know what I'm talking about). Soft. Melodic. Showcasing amazing guitar playing by the Edge and of course Bono's voice. <br /> <br />Original Species, I really liked. One of those songs without a distinct tune or sound so it keeps you engaged, trying to follow it. <br /> <br />All Because of You had potential (with its verses), but the chorus doesn't really do it for me. It starts off sounding similar to 'Even better than the real thing\\" in terms of style, but the chorus. Why? <br /> <br />Although \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" has been tauted as the best song on the album, I personally don't think so. There are the classic U2 fans who like Joshua Tree, War, etc, and then there are the modern U2 fans who like Pop, Achtung Baby, etc. I am the latter. So \\"Crumbs\\", \\"Original Species\\", \\"Vertigo\\" are some of my favorites on the CD. <br /> <br />If you're new to U2, this better not be your first album. <br /> <br />If you're a U2 loyalist, you've gotta add this one to the shrine.
0064407667|5.0|The book I will recommend to you is very miserable.  It is called '' The Bad Beginning'' by Lemony Snicket.  It is the 1st book of ''A Series of Unfourtunate Events''.  It tells about the lives of 3 unlucky children:  Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudilaire who start out as 3 rich, happy children.  Then one day they learn their parents and their mansion were destroyed in a fire.  After a few days, they are sent to live with the worst guardian imaginable:  Count Olaf.  He is an evil, greedy, murderous man who wants to kill them and steal the fortune their parents left behind.  He also has horrible looking assistants who help him with his evil schemes.  I would recommend this book to lots of people because even though it is completely and utterly miserable, it still has lots of imagination and humor.  By lots of people I mean everyone who likes every kind of genre except for a book with a happy ending.  
B00003CXCT|5.0|its true they do add hayden christian to jedi but any true star wars fan should appreciate this because hayden is the original darth vader he was ankin and as all true star wars fans know him it' complete ***** that because he replaced the original ankin that it unfafiul to the true saga ****** its how its meant to be  hayden is the original darth vader .
1573226521|4.0|After seeing the film, which I thought was quite good, I decided to read the book. I was amazed to find that the book's main male character was actually a Londoner, rather than an American. However, the film pretty much stays true to the book albeit for a couple of  sub-plots and storylines. The ending in the book is completely different and for this reason I would recommend that anyone who enjoyed the film should read it just to see what an alternative ending for the film might have been.
B000002GK1|5.0|Seriously.  What the hell is up with these silly monikers?  I think the term was probably first used to descibe the Melvin's sound - most likely in some indie zine.  All of the sudden, every rock band in Seattle is Grunge RockTM.  Alice in Chains had much more in common with a band like Kings X than with Nirvana.  Nirvana was more akin to The Pixies or The Ramones than to Pearl Jam.  To me, the bands of the early 90's Seattle scene could not have been more diverse.  Furthermore, at a time of extreme mediocrity in popular music, they were all quality bands.  Of all of these bands, Soundgarden was the best and, of all of their recordings, this is my favorite.  Grunge?  Badmotorfinger is blistering, smouldering, grade A Rock.<br /><br />Badmotorfinger sounds like Led Zeppelin with super powers.  Of course, there is also a progressive element, some punk influence, and a touch of Indie Rock quirkiness.<br /><br />\\"Rusty Cage\\" is one of the best rock songs I have ever heard.  Chris Cornell is absolutely amazing on the whole record.  This is Matt Cameron's best work to date.<br /><br />Now, Super Unknown may be a better album.  But this is my favorite.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|this contains all the huge essential number one hits such as <br />-billie jean <br />-thriller <br />-beat it <br />-blood on the dance floor <br />-smooth criminal <br />-dirty dianna <br />-the way you make me feel <br />-dont stop till you get enough  <br /> <br />plus rare songs and 3 brand new songs plus an awesome live dvd from 1992's \\"live and dangerous\\" concert!!!! <br /> <br />buy it and enjoy!!!!!
B00005V1B2|5.0|The good news is that they've finally dispensed with lyrics, unless you count certain breezy \\"do-do-do's\\" as some sort of psycho-cybernetic motivational advice.  There really isn't any strictly bad news, unless you consider that Camel were still actively derivative a bad thing, and taking into account their influences you can pretend it's homage rather than imitation (but couldn't they have invented their own story?).  'Rhayader Goes To Town' manages to sound like an outtake from both LIVING IN THE PAST and WATERLOO LILY, and there's definitely a creeping David Gilmour-like ambience to Latimer's guitar solos.  None of which prevents THE SNOW GOOSE from being a thouroughly pleasurable, if lightweight, listening experience.  Thank goodness they didn't go the David Bedford route and include narration.  The best tracks also happen to be the shortest, particularly Bardens' solo piano piece, 'Fritha Alone' which reprises the main theme of THE SNOW GOOSE and defines the overarching pathos of the book and the album in less than two minutes.  Pretty stuff.
B0006399FS|5.0|I always believe you should give some time to any CD before judging it. I bought this on release day, but gave it several repeated listens over a week before I decided to write this review. I'll admit, at first listen, I was lukewarm on this CD, however, I now believe this is one of the most brilliant CDs put out by U2. It is completely raw and spiritual, yet full of infectious hooks and authentic passion. Say what you want about these mega-millionaire rock stars, they are still very much in touch with the music and their core. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is easily one of the best U2 songs ever. I also like the fact that this CD doesn't sound as polished as the last one did. I hear a lot of old U2 here (i.e. October), however, it doesn't sound retro but quite evolutionary for this band. My favorite U2 CD is Achtung Baby, but How to Dismantle will definitely fall somewhere after that. I suppose depending on the day, Zooropa, Boy, and Unforgettable Fire fall somewhere in that Top 5 also.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|I've been a fan of WT for quite a while, and when I saw the video for stand my ground i was upset, because it sounded like they had sold out! But, I gave them a second try, and i'm glad I did. The rest of the album sounds like the band I know and love. So if you're willing to bypass Stand My Ground, then go for it. But if you're a new fan that wants to get into WT, then I'd highly recommend Mother Earth instead.
B000056HE9|5.0|This movie is a MUST have and a MUST to see!  The special affects for the time this movie was made were top of the line.  It's delightful to see how David Niven plays against Cary Grant.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm tired of the negative reviews. Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar, Larry's drumming and Adam's bass ALWAYS turns me on. ;) They have since the early 80's when I was in Jr HS! The boys have soul. That's something they will never lose.
B00006M183|4.0|The song Love Boat Captain makes me think, of course, of The Love Boat T.V. show. When I think of that show, I can't help but think of Julie McCoy (your Cruise Director.)<br /><br />Oh, what a beauty that Julie was! I can't understand why Doc, Gopher, Isaac and the Captain were always hitting on other women when the lovely Julie was right there under their noses. Julie was hotter than all of the special female guest stars (except, of course, for when Charo guest-starred.)<br /><br />Hats off to Pear Jam for honoring The Love Boat! (I bet that Eddie Vedder digs Julie, too.)
B000002NBY|4.0|Paul Simon's Career was practically doomed to the 1960's until he came up with Graceland. This was his come-back album and... he came back with a vengeance. This was a huge commercial and critical hit back in late '86 and '87. Most people born in the mid 1980's won't remember how big this album was, but will remember \\"The Lion King\\" soundtrack which was one of the biggest hits of the 1990's and was inspired by the South African rhythms heard here. Arguably, this is the best record of the 1980's. There are many more that deserve this title, but this is the first one I can think of.
0060506989|5.0|My Father's helicopter picked up the last men to leave ALBANY. <br /> <br />He was enlisted into the 11th Airmobile Division as a CH47 helicopter mechanic when the division was formed. He deployed to Vietnam with the renamed 1st Cav as assistant crew chief on a CH47. During the Battle of LZXRAY his helicopter flew non-stop resupply missions for three days to the firebases supporting the 1/7 and 2/7. Neither him nor any of the crew ever shut down the CH47 nor did they get much sleep.  <br /> <br />His aircraft later policed the ALBANY battlefield which means they flew out equipment and US Dead. He said his aircraft flew out four loads of dead wrapped in ponchos laid out 30-40 per load on the deck of the aircraft. And then they picked up the security element on their last flight.  <br /> <br />He has read the book many times and watched the movie several times with myself and my brothers, two of us are former Sergeants in the Army. The movie still gives him goose bumps, especially during the loading and LZ landing scenes.  <br /> <br />He served three tours in Vietnam with the 1st Cav. Because of his position as a helicopter crewman, crewchief, 1st Sergeant, and then BN Maint Supervisor, he saw action in just about every battle in the Highlands as well as outside Vietnam. He can recall verbatim many of the operations he was involved in. He has read many books on Vietnam, and has annotated the errors in them.    <br /> <br />His copy of this book has virtually no annotations which is a tribute to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's devotion to the men of the 1/7 and 2/7. This book and the movie will stand the test of time as it has stood the test of one of the best men to serve on a CH47.  <br /> <br />The book and movie should be required for all young men ( and women) who are considering joining the military. It is a sobering look at the hard realities of infantry battle during a meeting engagement. And it is a tribute to the leadership qualities and superior fighting spirit of the US Soldier.  <br /> <br />Hal Moore is a superior role model for young leaders. His leadership lessons are timeless and apply to all ranks and to all spheres of human endeavor. He shows that brains, courage, and brawn have to work together to win.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|4.0|I had read too many good reviews before I heard the album so I was a bit underwhelmed.  I was expecting their best yet.  Still, most of the songs are very good.  Vertigo is a clear hit.  Lyrics are of the high quality you would expect of U2.  Besides Vertigo, none of the songs blew me away.  I fully expect to appreciate this more each time I hear it.
0440211727|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read!  It was a book I was assigned in school and I could not put it down.  After reading To Kill A Mockingbird the book seemed even better.  The characters were well developed and the book was really believeable.   <br />A Time To Kill is the story of Jake Brigance trying to defend Carl Lee Hailey after Carl Lee killed the two rednecks that raped his daughter.  Carl Lee was black. <br />I liked this book because it showes how a father will do anything for his daughter even if it means going to jail, how people care more about what colour someone is then if they really are guilty or innocent, and how even when you think that you are defented you just have to carry on.   <br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes law novels and John Grisham.  Also to anyone who is trying to understand more about racism towards black people in the Southren United States.
B000001ES9|4.0|I love this album. It's just a downright fun, low-key, non-preachy rock debut. I see a lot of people have a problem with this album. To me, there's not a clunker in the bunch. I think I like the album so much because it comes across to me as a band just having fun. My favorites include some songs that don't get the attention that others do. Need Some Love, Before and After, and Here Again are my favorites. This was the beginning of phase 1 and I will always remember it fondly. What makes Rush so interesting is the evolution of the band. Take this for what it's worth. A debut album with a band just starting to find their identity. Honestly, I never get tired of listening to this.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|I happened to catch the preview for this DVD on MTV2 the other day and it was fantastic!  I ended up watching it from start to finish and being late for work!  While I'm not a big fan of concerts on DVD, the remake of Jolene and Jack White's passionate vocals make it the best live performance I've seen on TV since Nirvana did Unplugged.
B000002U9W|4.0|I'm going to go ahead and NOT write in all caps, if that's ok with you.  This is one of the pre-\\"Dark Side\\" Floyd albums that earned them the reputation of being uneven.  I can't really refute that judgement, but the implication in \\"uneven\\" is that some of it's good and some is bad.  I wholeheartedly agree with that--the title track is gorgeous.  Though the band later criticized themselves for being pretentious and messing up a few times on the final takes, the song works.  It has trademark Pink Floyd characteristics; laid back jamming, organ and guitar solos, a funky break, and some crazy sound effects.  The added orchestral arrangements by Geesin really supplement the band's sound well, and add an element of originality.  This song doesn't disappoint in the catalogue of epic Floyd tunes.  \\"If\\" is one of my least favorite Pink Floyd songs; I find the lyrics trite, and it doesn't really go anywhere (though it's one of the first songs dealing with insanity, later explored in depth in \\"Dark Side\\").  \\"Summer '68\\" is a great contribution from Rick Wright (it's him singing, not David Gilmour as one reviewer said).  It really bolsters Pink Floyd's sound when different members contribute songs.  \\"Summer '68\\" is kind of a Beatle-esque piano-driven song with awesome horns backing it up.  \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is pretty cool, and a worthwhile contribution from Gilmour, though he still hadn't found confidence in his voice.  \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" features a bunch of kitchen-related sound effects, but  fails to be engaging as an instrumental piece.  Overall, this album is worthwhile, but not as a first (or even second or third) Pink Floyd record to buy.  If you already have \\"Dark Side,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Obscured By Clouds,\\" you'll probably really enjoy it as a supplement, as it has a unique overall sound different from other Floyd, but if you don't have those other albums you should probably start with one or more of them.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Hey everyone! Lets jump onto the bandwagon and call that Quentin guy in a jogging suit God for making this unbelievable classic. Guys and gals this movie sucks, or blows ...whichever you prefer. Pulp Fiction is on the list of my top 5 best movies, but this?! What the hell is this? Manga story with cheese overflowing on all sides from the unbeliveably CORNY dialogue? Quentin has completely gone into his pre-teens and decided to play toy soldiers with actors after having watched something like Akira.  Ptew ptew KA-Pow!! Tratatatatat!.... Slash, bam... Why wouldn't he? He's got the \\"buzz\\" and money. Plus whatever he puts out since Pulp is masterpiece, right? I had more fun with Jackie Brown.
0767805712|5.0|GATTACA examines the nature of personal identity, personal destiny, and the idea that an individual can become more than the sum of his parts. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World already thoroughly covers these same themes regarding formulated utopias and caste systems, but GATTACA approaches them in a more sincere and less satirical manner than does Huxley's work. GATTACA is therefore a very literate piece of speculative science fiction that should appeal to those who desire more than the standard Star Wars or implausible alien fare. Unfortunately, the film is a bit too cerebral for the average filmgoer, and probably explains why GATTACA did not do so well in the box office. <br />GATTACA is about the story of a future society where one's ID has become their gene-pool. Those with an \\"acceptable\\" gene combination are given access to the better jobs and prospects, and most importantly a chance to leave this planet for outer space, where, by then, humans are exploring domains far beyond their own solar system. Those with an undesirable gene combination, that is, a predisposition for disease, health problems, low life expectancy, and other \\"imperfections,\\" are deemed, and doomed, to become society's second class citizens demoted to menial jobs and the streets. The first category is the \\"valids\\" and the second the \\"in-valids\\".  <br />The film tells the story of the symbolically named Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) who sets out to follow his dream of space travel, even though he was born the \\"old-fashioned\\" way, which renders him genetically flawed. As such, he is forced to work in low-level occupations, the fate of all \\"in-valids,\\" who represent the untouchables of that future class system in which genetic engineering has replaced the divisive powers formerly held only by wealth alone. Vincent, resourceful because of his spirit, a tendency for which there is no gene, as the movie's tagline suggests, finds a way to make his dreams a reality, though not without the help of a disabled \\"valid\\" (Jude Law). The \\"valid\\" Jerome, who lends Vincent his identity, as well as regular samples of his blood, urine, and other genetic identifiers used in monitoring society's privileged caste, while in possession of superior genes, lacks the one thing that transforms dreams into reality: the spirit of ambition, or the desire exceed expectations.  <br />Writer/director Andrew Niccol has rendered an ideal film depicting a future where governments determine its citizen's place in society before they're even born. This is fascism in its purest form. Our protagonist, Vincent, had the misfortune of being born a \\"God-child\\" conceived in the back seat of his parent's car. In the metallic, clinical, and sterile world of this film physical love is unnatural. Sex is an impulsive passionate act and therefore not in tune with the perfection of an intelligent, balanced, stoic, and ultimately robotic population. He is a \\"degenerate\\" whose future has been already determined, a life of undesirable jobs, being a marked citizen, and the stigma as an \\"invalid.\\" One day he realizes, after saving his near perfect, genetically engineered brother's life that he has what it takes to join the ranks of society's elite, and sets a plan in motion to join the GATTACA Company. And the extent Vincent goes to in order to achieve his goal is nothing less than inspiring.  <br />Considering the current lock down of our rights in society, (fingerprinting, racial profiling, and the unconstitutional patriot act) and due process dwindling at an alarming rate; genetic science becoming society's sole judge and executioner in our courts of law, and genetic science itself moving ahead in leaps and bounds without true and productive debate about the ethical implications, the world of GATTACA is almost upon us. As the film states at the beginning, \\"In the not so distant future,\\" is a frightening reality we must consider. This is an important film that should not be ignored. <br />Niccol's film is clever and full of detail, right down to the words and phrases - degenerates, borrowed ladders, \\"Eugene\\" and eugenics, GATTACA and the G-A-T-T-A-C-A sequences that make up DNA. Eugenics as a form of social control by governments over its subjects is a very real issue. The formation of a so-called \\"perfect\\" human being by way of genetic manipulation is a current science that is developing at such a rate that the ethical issues the subject raises, and the productive dialogue required when artificially controlling life, is falling way behind. Although eugenics is based on positive principle of breeding the best, it has been manipulated by Hitler, China, and even in our own federal government with terrifying consequences. The consequences include genocide, infanticide, and involuntary sterilization. <br />In Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, he explores a society where genetics is used to create the perfect society, and the ethical and social implications of such a world. He does not paint a positive picture. As Vincent proclaims, \\"Discrimination has now become a science,\\" regarding one's social status in society solely determined by the perfections or imperfections of their genetic make-up. Those without imperfections, the biological determined \\"elite,\\" are placed in the prestigious and important jobs and enjoy all the benefits. More than anything else, I believe, this important film is about the strength of the human spirit over so-called biological determinism. As Vincent, shows us, the will of the spirit far outweighs one's genetic predisposition.  <br />Although GATTACA takes place in a \\"not so distant future,\\" like all serious science fiction works, it is a commentary about the present. In its stylishly sequenced narrative, it is also a passionate tribute to the romantic notion that the human spirit is, and always will be, beyond the callous grip of science. Ironically, it may have been that very same romantic ambition of the human spirit, which drives Vincent towards the stars that brought the deadening \\"perfection\\" of the tightly controlled world of GATTACA into being in the first place. So while we observe this work of \\"fiction\\" we must realize that if a society is truly \\"judged on how it treats its least members\\" then is the \\"not so distant future\\" today? <br />

B000063DFN|5.0|The World Slavery Tour was my first concert ever and, in retrospect, what a great concert to start with! By 1984, when &#34;Powerslave&#34; came out, Iron Maiden had established themselves at the top of the heavy metal heap. Their previous album, &#34;Piece of Mind,&#34; was a huge seller, and the successful World Piece Tour set the bar high for the band's follow up. The radio was already playing &#34;Two Minutes to Midnight,&#34; so I had an idea we'd have more of the same good music.<br /><br />When &#34;Powerslave&#34; came out, I grabbed a copy as soon at it hit the stores. I still remember the album -- especially the textured front cover and a mass of hieroglyphics to decipher. (See what you lose with CD art?) There's all sorts of little messages Derek Riggs included in the cover, you just needed to have a hieroglyphics key to decipher them. I also recall there being a message scrawled on the vinyl's lead-out that said, &#34;There's only one!&#34;  I'm not sure if that was just a random note or if there was anything to it. Who knows, maybe I had the winning album in some sort of meet the band contest.<br /><br />Even though I had gotten a small sample of the music, I was a bit disappointed on first listen. I guess I was looking to be slapped in the face and bowled over by it, but that didn't happen. Maybe it was because the band's sound had become more technical, weaving together more intricate melodies, I'm not sure. Nevertheless, over the years, I've grown to really love the album.<br /><br />In retrospect, this is a pretty good place to start if you've never heard a full album from the band's earlier days. I've always thought &#34;The Number of the Beast&#34; was better, but &#34;Powerslave&#34; shows a band reaching their creative peak. You not only get songs that widely regarded as Iron Maiden classics: &#34;Aces High,&#34; &#34;2 Minutes to Midnight,&#34; and &#34;Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&#34; but the other songs round out the album almost to perfection. I have especially grown to love &#34;Back in the Village&#34; and &#34;Flash of the Blade,&#34; two songs I'd love to see in the setlist.<br /><br />One note -- I am especially thankful for &#34;Rime of the Ancient Mariner;&#34; it came along during Freshman year English class. While the song isn't the whole poem , it contained enough to allow me to quote several passages and pass many a quiz!love &#34;Back in the Village&#34; and &#34;Flash of the Blade,&#34; two songs I'd love to see in the setlist.

B0006284JQ|5.0|All I have to say is: Britney is the best, she may not be a great singer but that's okay.  <br /> <br />To the haters: She's hotter than all of you, so shut up. :)
6305718954|2.0|This movie was just dumb.  Anyone who know anything about stimatists knows that they don't experience what Frankie did in this movie (there are people today that receive the stimata). This was more like demonic possession than a gift from God.  The film lost me here... why would such a gift manifest itself in such a evil and demonic way?  Even if she was \\"channeling\\" the dead priest, was he not a holy man, and not the devil?<br /><br />Also- I hate the way they portrayed the Catholic Church.  Are there really police in the Vatican library watching over the priests who are engaged in research, threatening them if they seem to be doing anything \\"suspicious?\\" Give me a break.  And for all the claims of the church subverting this \\"dangerous\\" document, it is widely available for all the read on the internet. Funny, the Church still exists in spite of that.  I read some of this \\"gospel,\\" and it reads alot like the Bible... I hardly see where saying \\"The Kingdom of Heaven is within you and all around you\\" is very scandalous..... Jesus told us that He lives within each of us, and His spirit is wherever 2 or more are gathered in His name.  It sounds alot like when Jesus told folks in the Bible that \\"The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\\"  Anyway.... it seems like just another Hollywood attack on the Catholic Church, which is used to such attacks, since it's the only Christian church that has been around since Jesus founded it himself (and promised that the Gates of Hell should not prevail against it.) In spite of all of these attacks by secular media, the Church will be here forever... and stronger for having endured.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I think this classic movie depicts a story of the ages with a talent and skill that I never believed possible in today's world. I think this movie was tossed aside simply because of the well known names which were involved, rather than the content and acting skills. I have read both the Iliad and the Odyssey and am an enormous fan of Homer's, and am inspired by the fact believe that such stories can still be told so beautifully and moving.
B0001611DI|5.0|ONe of my favourite movies of all time.  Although the remake in 2003 was not bad there somehting about Zombie's being able to run that didint do it for me.  The extras intervies on the DVD are fantastic.  If it wasnt for movies like this then other classics like Shaun of the dead which is extremely funny woudl never have ben made.  I hear roumours that he will be making a 4th movie. Cant wait.
0060523794|4.0|Lou Gerstner has written an interesting first person study of how organizations can become plagued by inertia, and fall out of step with their industry. As an outsider, Gertsner was immediately able to spot troubling cultural behavior and ask questions about IBM's products, strategy, and way of conducting business that insiders did not. Some of the most interesting material deals with trying to change both strategy and behaviors once he recognized that they were leading IBM towards potential ruin.  <br /> <br />The turnaround at IBM has been quite a success story, and Gerstner definitely deserves his share of the credit. In the information technology business, becoming set in your ways can be the a kiss of death, and he explains in an easily readable style how he helped wake up big blue, while others would have preferred to fly it into the ground rather than change.   <br /> <br />Still, I wondered if as an outsider, he 'missed something' regarding the cultural at IBM.  Clearly tying results to compensation, and removing power and status as key elements of the rewards system created a more market and profit focused company.  But while 'Built to Last' outlines the importance of loyalty and continuity in first class companies, this trait seems to be looked down upon in the tech sector  (not just at the pre-Gerstner IBM, but also more recently at HP and PeopleSoft.)   <br /> <br />In this regard, I enjoyed Andy Grove's book \\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" a bit more, as he discusses fostering a winning culture at Intel that has kept them on top for quite a while, despite competing in an industry that requires constant innovation.  You get the feeling that Gerstner was more of a Mr. Fixit...focused on the short-term turn-around. It would have been interesting to hear him talk more about the long-term strategies for IBM to remain competitive, and particularly how to use IBM's size as an asset rather than liability.

B0002TT0NM|2.0|I am disappointed for all the reasons cited by the reviewers who aren't terribly fond of this version of Book 3; too dark, too short, too little plot elaboration, too little humor.

B000099T3P|4.0|Ah, those memories of the eighties when movies like this were fun and not too gory.  CRITTERS is a funny, tongue in cheek look at a bunch of furry critters who come to earth to eat people.  My favorite scene is when one of the little devils comes upon a stuffed E.T., asks him who he is and then promptly devours him.  Ironic that Dee Wallace Stone who plays the mother in this movie was also in E.T.  The movie has lots of laughs, and a few chills along the way.  M. Emmet Walsh is the sheriff; Don Opper is the bumbling Charlie; and young Scott Grimes is the boy hero.  Catch Titanic and Phantom's Billy Zane in one of his early roles.<br /><br />Maybe not as much fun as GREMLINS, but still a classic of its kind.
B00008438V|4.0|I saw this as a child and then again as an adult. I think I enjoyed it more as an adult. It is an amusing story of two teenage boys. This is another cheesy 80s movie that I watch over and over again because it is entertaining. It is potentially better than anything released in recent years. The story line is more possible today than it was back then. I will be interested to see how the story line holds up when this is actually possible.
B000065V3H|5.0|One of the best teen movies of all time, especially for the generation x crowd. Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson were perfectly cast, and the desert setting,(Tuscon, Arizona)put the icing on the cake. What was really nice about this movie was the fact that nudity and foul language were not needed to get the point across. I did a little research and realized that Dempsey was in his early twenties, maybe 21, when he filmed this movie, while Amanda Peterson was 5 years younger.If you have a soul, this movie will touch you in some way.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|As a child I loved this story. It was like a dream to go out into space. The story line is silly. It will be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. Especially those adults who remember the era this movie was made in. Now I think about things like how did they breath in space without an oxygen machine or something and so forth. It is a fun fantasy. It is still enjoyable. It is good that it makes me think.  <br /> <br />I am looking forward to giving this to my daughter as a Christmas gift this year. I hope that she will be part of the next generation to enjoy it.
B000007VCM|5.0|I cannot understand why I do not hear about this album in the press or on the net more. This is an absolutley amazing album - The Cult never really got back to this standard. 'Love' appeals to both goths, metallers, alternative fans, everyone! Even the pop charts couldn't get enough of 'Rain' or 'She Sells Sanctuary'. The guitar on this album almost swirls, and all the tracks have a dreamy, undulating quality to them ('Big Neon Glitter', 'Love'), with some stormy moments ('Phoneix'). The ballads are amazing 'Brother Wolf, Sister Moon' especially. The only slight problem with this album is the lyrics, which sometimes repeat too much ('Rain') but personally, this does not, in anyway, affect enjoyment for me personally. The album may be too gothic/alternative for some mainstream fans, but I would definitley reccomend this album over any of The Cult's other recordings, but still 'Electric', 'Ceremony' etc. are brilliant, just more mainstream. <br /> <br />
B0000640VO|5.0|I have used this video to stimulate some wonderful in class discussions. Topics can include the art involved in the film, the nature of introverts compared to extroverts, the nature of depression and happiness, the relationship the music has to the emotional impact the film has (try watching it without the music?) and many others. All such discussions take on an energy of their own because the film is so enjoyable and everyone seems to enjoy trying to figure out why.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Even if you aren't a hard rock fan, but love music, then you should get this DVD just because of its shear power and full on rocking. Some reviews have complained about the sound or the picture quality  and yes if you put on good quality headphones some of the songs sound that good and spot on that you swear you are listening to the album track but this only enhances the visuals. As for the picture quality they are as good as any I have seen for a live concert, considering alot of it was shot at night time.  <br />Basically this is 2 hours of non stop great music, helped by one of the best, most energetic and hardest playing guitarists in the world. Helped by a powerhouse drummer who looks as strong at the end of the show as he does at the beginning and a bass and second lead guitarist who basically stand still for the whole 2 hours (as they always have) and just add  fuel to the fire. But most of all a tight band who just play incredible simple riffs that just keep coming and coming. My favourites would be the 17 minute version of \\"Let There Be ROCK\\" and the opener \\"Thunderstruck\\". <br />I'm not a big AC/DC fan but this would be one of my favourite music DVDs! Turn it up!!
B000002L7R|3.0|Look there are 3 reasons why this album didn't work for PRINCE (and his REVOLUTION).<br /><br />1. Everyone was still vibin' to the 'PURPLE RAIN' soundtrack.<br /><br />2. The album came out in less than a year of 'PURPLE RAIN'. He could have done a MICHAEL JACKSON move,released \\"Darling Nikki\\" as a single and have 6 from that album. ('PURPLE RAIN' June 1984,'AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY' March 1985). Needed more time to record better songs.<br /><br />3. It wasn't good timing.<br /><br />What do I mean? He's in his heyday. On top of the world. Then he releases merry-go-round music like \\"Paisley Park\\",dedicates an almost 4-minute song to a \\"Tambourine\\" and just when you think he abandoned the rock that finally got him fame,he threw in a whack \\"Temptation\\".<br /><br />\\"Condition Of The Heart\\" & \\"The Ladder\\" is on some personal and spiritual shhh,but songs like the disco bangin' \\"America\\",the funk again finally \\"Pop Life\\" and the happy-be-gay (content) \\"Raspberry Beret\\" and the oriental sounding title track seem to make this album. It's an OK album but I believe that you don't release an experimental album at the height of your career.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I finally got around watching \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\"  After two hours of occasionally yawns, I walked away with two impressions: 1) I didn't see why some in the Jewish community called this \\"anti-semitic\\"; anti-high priests of the time, maybe, but not anti-Jewish; and 2) the violence in the movie was not too bad, at least not in this day and age where every other movie shows you what a cadaver should look like.<br /><br />Overall I found the movie visually compelling.  The use of lighting is wide-ranging, to the point of too much instead of too effective.  What I could not grasp was exactly what the movie was trying to say.  It seemed to me that the movie was just trying to deliver a visual impact but otherwise offered nothing much of substance.  Don't get me wrong.  If you are really into the Christ stuff, you may find this moving and \\"educational.\\"  But for the rest of us mere mortals more interested in feeding our families and filing tax returns than religious studies, the movie comes up rather empty in its deliverance.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first bought AMERICAN IDIOT, I listened to it all the way through without stopping, something that I rarely do unless the CD is really, really good. Before listening to AMERICAN IDIOT, I wasn't a big punk fan, and I'd heard the lead single \\"American Idiot\\" and liked what I heard.  The rest of the album was just a great as \\"American Idiot\\".  This \\"rock-opera\\" setting as everyone else refers to it is super, super effective.  It is a 100% focused album, and one that may garner Grammys in 2005.  \\"GIVE ME NOVACAIN\\", \\"BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS\\", \\"JESUS OF SUBURBIA\\", are just some of my top picks from AMERICAN IDIOT.  I think that AMERICAN IDIOT is one of the top albums of 2004 not only as an album, but as the creativity and ambition invested in it.  It is very political, but even if you don't agree, you'll still love AMERICAN IDIOT.  5 stars!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is such a low-IQ movie that it actually insults the audience.  It has everything that's wrong with today's movies -- a pretty-boy prime minister (no, Blair is not pretty, Huge Grant is), a modern-day cinderella, a stereotypical [...] man, a single father, an interracial couple -- and it tries too hard to be \\"cute.\\"  None of the stories is engaging and none of the characters really captures your heart -- unless you like to be insulted by the insolence of the filmmakers.
B000099T2L|4.0|Everyone knows that Beyonce is the star of Destiny's Child.  It isn't surprising that her solo LP is much better than say a Destiny's Child CD.  Hits on this 4 star album include \\"Crazy in Love\\" f/ Jay-Z, \\"Baby Boy\\" f/ Sean Paul, \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Me Myself, and I\\",\\"Yes\\", and \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\". The arrangements work well for Beyonce's voice, letting her upper register succesfully show. While the album is slightly overhyped, it is a good, solid R&B album and Beyonce does have a good voice. 4 stars for DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE!

B00006879E|5.0|This album is easily one of the best modern pop/funk/rock albums ever, that I have heard. It is well done, sounds great... but most of all.. the delivery of the songs is fantastic. Adam Levine is the true genious behind these songs as far as I can tell. He sounds amazing, and his voice really conveys the feeling of what he sings. I have even heard the Demos of these songs, and when you hear them stripped down to basics, with mainly Adam's voice to carry the emotion of the tune.. you can hear the quality in their art.<br /><br />Maroon 5 have really progressed in their sound since they were Kara's Flowers. They had a sound similar to WEEZER, I would say when they were KF.. but now they have an amazing sound all their own. I have seen them LIVE 3 times, and have never been dissapointed.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I am a huge fan of Hip-Hop, Electronic and Rock Music. This is a funky bridge that brings out the best of what there is to offer! LOVE IT LIKE I DO!
B0006399FS|4.0|This probely thier best work since Achtung Baby. From Beginning to end. It sounds a little like All that you can Behind.But it is better.It definatly is a U2 cd, WITH The brilliant guitar playing of the Edge, and bass of Adam Clayton.<BR>and the best part of this Cd. Lillywhite, Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, all worked on ths Cd.
068485743X|4.0|Noah Lukeman's book provides a look at writing from a very important perspective, and a number of important reminders for writers at any level. While most of us are fond of sayings like \\"when you start worrying about getting published, you might as well stop writing\\", the truth is there's no point in creating a story if it's not going to be shared. And who better to help show the most important things to watch out for than someone who spends his days rejecting manuscripts? <br /> <br />Perhaps the thing I like most about this book is that there are constant reminders that writing is an art form. Sometimes we forget that, sometimes we say what we've created is \\"good enough\\" when we've only half-revised it. Mr. Lukeman gives numerous little reminders that \\"good enough\\" is never, really good enough. <br /> <br />The greatest flaw in the story are the examples he gives for each of the flaws you need to watch for. The problem is that he makes the issue far too obvious. If he had spent the time to make a subtler example, it would have served much better in showing how to weed these items out of your own work. <br /> <br />Overall, The First Five Pages is an excellent work, and belongs on every writer's bookshelf.
B00005614M|4.0|I really like miles davis but this cd I listen to the least it's just to structured for miles and simple awesome jazz it's just I'am more of a fan of kind of blue and [...]brew songs like spanish key and so what are my favorites
B0001HAISG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! At the age of 15, I had forgotten the story of peter pan, but when this movie came out I was flooded with fond memories of the animated movie and decided to watch it. I automatically set myself up for disappointment and to be bored, but to my amazement-this movie was fantastic. Jeremy was great as peter pan-a  lot of people didn't like him because they thought he was \\"over-acting\\" but they COULDN'T have read the book, because that's the way peter pan is; a bit self absorbed very energetic and maybe a bit of a brat-but loveable all the same. Wendy was played well, so we're the lost boys, (I loved slightly!) And her two brothers (john was a laugh) Tinker bell was good, allough a lot of people didn't like the way she over acted-since she couldn't talk there wasn't any other way for her to get the message across (did you think about that before you commented?!) Jason Isaac's plays both father and caption hook-surprisingly I didn't even notice, and I doubt any one else will. His acting is so totally different and good in these two roles that it wouldn't matter if you recognised him as the same person anyway. Allough this movie stays pretty much true to the book, there are some scenes that are taken-added or the words are slightly changed, however, it all fits together perfectly-there are no flaws. This is a great movie for the whole family-heck I'm 15 and I LOVE it! (I don't ever want to grow up!) The dvd is good, with lots of extra features, which are very interesting and funny. There is a lot of great stuff in this movie-action, love comedy, it's great. The one thing I didn't like at FIRST was the ending in the book that they left out, but when I watched it in the special features I realised this was a change for the better-if they left it in the movie would of ended on a sad note-and we don't want that!  <br /> <br />WATCH IT! <br /> <br />And as peter would say \\"oh the cleverness of me!\\"  <br />
B000001FFJ|2.0|I got this cds because I have read all kinds of good reviews and only liked the songs clap hands and jockey full of bourbon the rest I think is complete junk those of you who are fans of tom if any of his other albums sound like those two for the whole album please let me know because I loved those songs.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|First of all don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. Yes, movies books, and everything included. From the three movies so far, I agree that The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best of all in cinematographical merits, but the quality of the DVD is inferior to its predecessors. The first two came in a nice flip cardboard boxes, while this one comes in the standard DVD-case. Honestly when you place your three DVD's the last one doesn't look good compared with the previous ones.<br /><br />Now commenting on the contents of the DVD, I have to say I was very disappointed too. The extra scenes were only 3 and basically none provided anything else to what we had seen. The extra scenes from both The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets were certainly more and added a little bit of info to the movie that had to be cut for length matters.<br /><br />Anyway, as a fan this DVD is a must, but certainly it could have been better, considering all the months we had to wait to get it. Definitely I expected more, I hope for The Goblet of Fire DVD the WB guys will do better.
B000002LVB|2.0|thought to be a lost album among the other amazing velvet underground records, i was very excited to have came across this record. this record is almost done with the second song on the second side and i am incredibley dissapointed already. This album lacks a great deal of substance that the others had. It is complete studio pop from 1970. lou reeds vocals have changed so much since their debut album. for some odd reason he thought rock and roll growls were the way to go on this one. the only songs that i found had potential were \\"who loves the sun\\" and head held high. now that the third song on the second side is playing, i realize that there is no hope for this album. im sorry lou but john cale was the real man behind the velvet underground. buy \\" the velvet underground and nico\\" first. you can almost disregard this as the real deal. thanks.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|The question is:  What was there not to like about the elder Bloom?  We'd all give anything to have a father like that.  The son, well, he needs years of therapy.  What was his problem?  Well, at least at the end, he got it - but by then, it was too late!
B0006399FS|1.0|I am a dedicated U2 listener. However, I really do not understand this album. It is fairly slow paced, non-melodic, and boring. I think the first song is the only song worth listening to. If I was to use a standard, the previous album, ATYLB, was simply awesome. Each song was worth listening to over and over again.  <br /> <br />I am not sure why the other reviewers are ga-ga about this album. It is fairly weak and I really can't stand listening to each song. This is an album where you are skipping through it because few songs are worth listening to.  <br /> <br />I was disappointed with this purchase.
B00005JLTR|4.0|After many, many, many years of waiting patiently for this DVD release it still is a no show.  It's not the greatest movie in the world, it didn't exactly break box office records, so why I am I still forced to watch a cracky-line filled 20 something year old copy of this musical?  I don't want to speculate but it must have something to do with the music rights.  Everyone get over it.  The fans clammer for this one, Babs!  Make us all happy.  The movie itself is high camp, a guilty pleasure if it were.  Kris Kristofferson is no actor, not really a good singer either, but HE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL songwriter.  And, Babs, we LOVE the hair, and the end credit line MS. Streisand's wardrobe by... her closet!  That's priceless.  No film collection would be complete without this one.  Watch closely now...
B00005K3LU|5.0|\\"Die Hard\\"... what more to say that has already been said? One of the best action movies of all time. But it also doubles as a good Christmas-time movie. <br /> <br />Our hero John McClaine, played by Bruce Willis, is a cop from New York who comes down to L.A. to spend time with his family during Christmas. His wife works at a building called the Nakatomi building, he visits her there, only to be faced with something really bad. Terrorists take over the building and want to get something of value that resides in it. Hans Gruber, played by Alan Rickman, is the leader of the German terrorists. They've got the hostages under control, so everything seems to be going smoothly for the bad guys... unfortunately, John McClaine goes medieval on their asses and stops at nothing to rid the place of terrorists to save not only the hostages, but his wife as well. <br /> <br />There's plenty of action packed scenes to keep you, the viewer, entertained. Explosions, lots of shoot 'em up scenes, fighting, etc. Of course, a few one liners, some cheesy, and some just very badass (\\"Yippie-kai-yay, mother [fudger]\\"). There's also plenty of humor throughout the movie (the two FBI agents that share the last name Johnson, but no relation: one on the radio, \\"This is Agent Johnson... no, the other one.\\"). \\"Die Hard\\" is pretty much your typical action flick, only better since it's one of the first wave of action movies (released in the '80s). A larger-than-life hero saves the day from the evil terrorists' plot and gets the woman. But John here isn't very much larger-than-life. He's still human. He gets hurt badly in many scenes, and at one point he feared he's gonna die soon, but he still does his job to save the hostages, kill the terrorists, and save his wife. <br /> <br />Want an action movie to enjoy? \\"Die Hard\\" should be your first thought that comes to mind. Want a good Christmas movie to enjoy as well? Look no further. Stick this into your DVD player once December 25 rolls by (or maybeDec. 24), or buy it for someone to stick into their stocking. By any means necessary, watch this movie. A true masterpiece of the action genre, as well as an action classic.
0312263120|5.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books thus far, and this has to be one of my favorites.  While some of the other reviewers seem to be bent out of shape about some of the falsities present in the book, I ignore them.  Why?  I didn't read this book in an attempt to have a better understanding of the NSA.  I have no need to know how it functions, and if those bits are off, so be it.  I read this book for entertainment, and at that it succeeded beautifully.<br /><br />If you don't like a lot of technical talk, then this book may not be for you.  But if you can get past that I think that you'll enjoy it.
B00005JKN9|5.0|The film is supposedly a historical take on the Five Points and gangs that ran New York during the mid 1800s. Based on a book of the same name, Scorsese finally puts the film he's always wanted to make for 20+ years on the big screen. <br /> <br />A big-budget flick with such a gritty look at New York City didn't sit well with audiences and film critics. It did moderately well in the box-office, but \\"moderately\\" means a flop in the movie biz. It garnered 10 Academy Award Nominations, but didn't receive one stinking award. The musical \\"Chicago\\" and Holocaust epic \\"The Pianist\\" was everyone's pick. \\"Gangs of New York\\" didn't get the love and appreciation that a Scorsese movie usually receives. <br /> <br />The plot snypnosis mostly deals with a young Irish man named Amsterdam who vows revenge on the person who killed his father. His father, named Priest Vallon, played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, is (err... was) the leader of the gang, the Dead Rabbits. A battle ensued at the beginning of the movie between the Dead Rabbits (and a few other gang allies) against the Natives. The leader of the Natives is Bill \\"The Buther\\" Cutting, played masterfully by Daniel-Day Lewis. The bloody battle ensues, but its violent content isn't as shocking as the opening of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Ultimately, Priest is killed at the hands of Bill the Butcher. The battle ends, and now Bill makes the rules of the Five Points, as well as New York City. Amsterdam, a young boy witnessing his father's death, is then sent off to an orphanage. <br /> <br />Amsterdam now grows up (played by Leonardo Di Caprio) and seeks to avenge his father's death. He manages to infiltrate the Natives gang and works under Bill's hand. Ultimately this isn't good since the two become friends and Bill treats Amsterdam as if he was his own son. Conflict arises. <br /> <br />Some historical facts are tossed in like the Draft Riots that occur late into the film, corrupted politician William \\"Boss\\" Tweed (played by Jim Broadbent), and of course the Five Points. These facts aren't just tossed in for the heck of it, but they closely tell a brief timeline and background of New York City's history and the gangs that once ruled the city. Sure, it's a gritty historical background, but it's just the plain truth. Naturally, Hollywood might've exaggerated a bit at small parts in this movie, but the movie as a whole is executed brilliantly. <br /> <br />The movie talks more of past American crime and democracy. So many events were squeezed into this movie that it was just too huge to be put on the big screen. I've read somewhere that the movie was supposed to be longer, but Scorsese cut it down. He still managed to tell a certain point in American history very well in this movie, but maybe if he had stuck in the deleted scenes with the DVD, maybe the movie might've been much better and perhaps even garnered the appreciation it rightfully deserves. \\"Gangs of New York\\" is more than just a movie about revenge. It still tells the story of the gangs and the events that surrounded that point in New York City's history. <br /> <br />The extra DVD features offers a bit more insight on the history of the Five Points, which really help understand parts of the movie. Also a set design featurette and commentary by Martin Scorsese. Only minor grudge with the DVD is that the movie is spans over two discs. C'mon, \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" fit onto one disc (and that movie version is longer than this movie), but it was probably because the movie has DTS sound (which takes up a lotta room on a disc). <br /> <br />In my opinion, this was the movie that should've garnered at least an Oscar or two, most importantly in the Best Director and Best Actor categories. I'm sorry... I liked \\"The Pianist,\\" but it was no \\"Schindler's List\\" and it felt like watching \\"Cast Away\\" set during World War II. Daniel-Day Lewis was truly the best actor, and Scorsese truly was the best director. <br /> <br />The end of \\"Gangs of New York\\" was something truly remarkable. It showed Manhattan's transition over the years. Watching the buildings slowly become bigger as times change, then it gets into the modern age and shows the Twin Towers standing tall once again. Unlike how post-9/11 movies digitally erased the two buildings and acting as if the event never happened, Scorsese kept them there, standing tall, probably to remind us Americans that we still stand united, strong, and proud, to say that we will not falter.
B00004Z459|1.0|I only spent $9.99 CDN on this CD but even that was a huge waste. This is worse than Meteora and now that they teamed up with a rapper to record their next CD. I have lost all respect for these talentless gays. The guys who play an instrument suck at it. The rapper is bad even for a rapper. Chester can't scream and is a pussy. How did I ever like this pour excuse for music. Don't buy this!!! Want good music? I suggest The Beatles or Pink Floyd. Want good rock? Go for Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, or AC DC, want metal? Go for Metallica they rock? Want Punk? Go for Rise against, NOFX, Pennywise, or Bad Religion. Want stuff that's on MTV? Get Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Yellowcard. Want rap? Get better tastes in music! I can't believe I spent almost $30 on this CD and meeotra. It woud have been better spent on that Nirvana DVD. <br /> <br />Don't buy this CD. It's not music. Only buy this if it's beside something a lot worse like 50 cent and you REALLY want to buy something.
B00005JLT5|4.0|The Holocaust is truly one of history's most tragic events. The hatred of the Nazis towards the Jewish folk is just something that's demented and evil.    \\"The Pianist\\" revolves around this heartbreaking event that occured in the Warsaw ghetto. Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist that is respected and well-known throughout Europe (at the time). Brilliant music, I must say. Ultimately, his fame comes to an end when the Germans round up the Jews, thusly ending Szpilman's fame and gift. He and his family become split up, unfortunately, for his family, they've reached their untimely fates. Szpilman on the other hand has his life spared. Why? Because of his gift. He is alone. He manages to survive the whole conflict, going from living as a recluse in an apartment full of Jewish-hating Germans, then living out on the war-torn community by his lonesome, trying to survive.    A true story of this brilliant and brave musician, who fought against all odds and managed to survive the war years. Director Roman Polanski is also a Holocaust survivor as well. His experiences helped make the movie more accurate. He poured his heart and soul into this movie. Although the movie is executed very well... I'm just not... feeling it. Yeah, it depicts the Holocaust thoroughly and accurately, but to be brutally honest... I thought of \\"The Pianist\\" as another \\"Cast Away.\\" We never really know Szpilman at all other than a surviving Polish musician. He expresses emotion, but most of the time, he's quiet and helpless. He really doesn't have much of a personality other than playing the piano extremely well. Perhaps the book can give us more of Szpilman's personality. Given this flaw, I don't think Adrien Brody deserved that Oscar at all. Yeah, go ahead and criticize me, but that's my take.    \\"The Pianist\\" is good, but it's no \\"Schindler's List.\\" Honestly, I can't see how people call this movie better than \\"Schindler's List.\\" That movie established a hero that saved 1,000 Jews from death. \\"The Pianist\\" is nothing more than a movie of survival (hence, the comparison to \\"Cast Away\\"). And \\"Schindler's List\\" focused more on the Holocaust. \\"The Pianist\\" only briefly tells the horrible tale. Yeah, criticize me again, but that's just how I see it.    Despite my lil' rants, \\"The Pianist\\" is truly a good film, but not great. But it is told as it was written in the book, and accurately portrayed by Polanski. Afterall, the movie is told from the perspective of one man that saw it through his eyes and survived to tell the horrific tale.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|who seriously likes this crap, now im not so much about solos when it comes to extreme metal like cannibal corpse, suffocation, Death and kataklysm (those bands kick a**), but slipnuts makes a poor attempt at trying to sound original with 8 talentless members and a good drummer who's wasting his time playing nu metal. I've recently read and seen that slipknot was voted #5 on the top 50 heaviest bands in Revolver and was also voted THE heaviest modern \\"metal\\" band by MTV it figures since people who nominate such sh*tty bands as the heaviest probably haven't heard any of the other 20 something good bands out of all 50. I mean c'mon how is slipknot heavier than Napalm Death, Slayer, Anthrax, Obituary, Morbid Angel and its not all about heaviness either its about talent, slipknot has 9 members and still they go nowhere with their unskillful riffs and lame vocals that try to sound death metal-like. It truly is an insult to compare a band like slipknot to the great band Death and its frontman death-metal father \\"Evil Chuck\\". If you truly believe slipknot is the heaviest band out there or think they're talented then by all means go out and buy their cheap music they'll thank you somehow probably by literally throwing [...] at you in one of their concerts    BANDS THAT ARE REAL METAL AND REAL HEAVY  Nile, Sodom, Kreator, Suffocation, Megadeth, Iron Angel, Carcass, Iced Earth, Destruction, Immortal, Darkthrone, Burzum,
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I don't know what is most impressive:  The numbers of albums these guys put out in the few years they were recording, the quality of their work or the change from the early days to the later recordings. <br /> <br />This is an impressive collection, showing that development from early songs like She Loves You and I Want To Hold Your Hand to the later hits like Let It Be.   <br /> <br />These guys produced more great records in about 5 years than other bands that have been around for 25 years.   <br /> <br />Every Beatles fan should own this cd.
B0006399FS|5.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is smoking, its HOT! This album has the bite and feel of the early U2 stuff (Boy, October etc)., and the lyrical content is outstanding, provocative and makes one think (Again much like there early stuff) Just listen to the Lyrics in vertigo as an example. All the songs are very good and there are some stand out songs; Vertigo; Sometimes you can't make it on your own; and Yahweh are all excellent. You can put this CD on and listen to it all the way through and also over and over again.
B00030590I|5.0|My friend, who loves Tony Leung, showed me this film a few months before it was released in theaters and I jsut loved it.  The visuals were absolutely stunning.  Even if you're not that interested in the story, though I don't see how you couldn't be, see it for the cinematography alone.  I personally found the story to be very well done and interesting.  I love the way different colors were used symbollically throughout the film, until finally in the final sequence, everything is in white and the actual events are revealed.  I also enjoyed the love story between Flying Snow and Broken Sword.  When I watched this with my friends,we were in tears for the whole second half of the movie!  I also was able to see it on the big screen and loved it there too.  I think this is a wonderful movie, but I know a lot of people went in thinking it was this huge martial arts masterpiece full of fighting.  While there are fight scenes, they are not the focus of the story.  I greatly enjoyed this film and I would highly recommend it.
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down finally pays the due respect to the fallen members of America's military. Thanks to Bowden, and of course Hollywood, the horror story of the battle in Mogadishu was taken from being hidden under a veil of defeat and embarrassment to finally pay the respects to those who deserve it. Bowden's ability to describe each character with such detail and energy brings the reader into an emotional bond to them, bringing the reader in as if they were stranded on the streets of Mog too. The background and thoughts expressed during the story give another dimension that was impossible to present in the actual movie. The true horror, loss, and pain experienced by each and every member of the task force was brought to life by Bowden and his skillfully written novel. One of the most important aspects was to be able to honor those who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and safety of others. The real stories of each Ranger or Delta Force operator that gave his life are finally presented in the book.  Their heroics during the mission, even in the direst situations, just goes to show how elite and honorable they are. Bowden's novel brings the horror of battle in Mog to life, finally presenting what really happened and honoring those who gave their lives. Great novel.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|What is going on with UNIVERSAL PICS.  Because of all of the extra junk that they put on this dvd they have no room left for the DTS soundtrack.  Sad So SAD!!!  They are doing this to all of their movies recently, STOP IT!!!
B0002I831S|4.0|... although there is some great stuff here.<br /><br />I love the original Star Trek.  All of its successors pale in comparison.  Sure, The Next Generation had its moments.  Even Deep Space Nine had a few doozies.  But the rest?  Junk.  The original Star Trek was a study in terrific storytelling -- great television on a par with The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />The great episodes in this volume include Balance of Terror (one of the all-time greats, I loved how it intruduced the Romulans in a deadly cat and mouse battle) , The City on the Edge of Forever (despite all of Ellison's tired carping, a much better version than his unedited original screenplay), Space Seed, Return of the Archons, and Where No Man Has Gone Before.<br /><br />The quality of the video and audio is amazing, and you'll find yourself glued to DVD after DVD.
B00005UEAR|4.0|It makes sense that Dream Theater would come out with a disc like this after the critically acclaimed \\"Scenes From a Memory.\\" Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (SDOIT), is made up of two discs, the first which has five REALLY long songs (average time is about 10:00), while the second disc is an eight part song that tells the story of two people going mentally insane. <br />The first disc is probably my favorite, and includes the best 1-2-3 punch on any of their albums so far. \\"The Glass Prison\\" is the heaviest song Dream Theater has ever done. Included in the song are two lightning-fast solos by Petrucci that prove that he is the most talented guitarist, ever! Even with mediocre lyrics and the so-so second part (out of three), this is a great song and it must be amazing to see it performed live. \\"Blind Faith\\" is much different than the previous track but is also really good. It contains a long instrumental section that boasts an outstanding solo by Rudess and great riffs by Petrucci, the only downside to the song being the short piano solo in the middle that seems out of place. \\"Misunderstood\\" could have been the greatest song on the album. Many people complain about James LaBrie's vocals, but this is definitely his best performance ever; he sounds great. The song drags on too long, unfortunately, and there is this unnecessary part near the end where it sounds like Petrucci is trying to saw his guitar in half. It drags near the end, but this is a great song. \\"The Great Debate\\" tackles the issue of stem-cell research, without taking any side. This song is much too long and boring, by time the instrumental section kicks in, it's been nearly 9:00 of boredom. It's too bad because there are some good parts to this song. <br />The second disc is made up entirely of the title track, divided into eight separate parts. Each section is different, made up of folk, metal, a ballad, classical, as well as straightforward progressive rock. The music is enjoyable, as are sections two-four as well as seven, but the lyrics are sometimes so cheesy and lame it is unbearable. Still many fans of \\"Scenes\\" should enjoy this. <br />Some of Dream Theater's influences show up in the songs, see if you can pick them up. Pantera, yes; Tool, yes; ELP, yes; Yes, yes (Hahaha I'm so funny). Also the entire \\"Disappear\\" screams Radiohead: It and all other terrible Radiohead songs should do what the title says and disappear. <br />I can see that Dream Theater was trying to appeal to the many fans that they picked up after \\"Scenes\\" (Even though that album is somewhat overrated), but the songs are very hard to pick up on, mostly people who where long-time DT fans would be able to enjoy it the most. It is a shame that the lyrics are their poorest yet, because LaBrie delivers arguably his best vocal performance ever! If you are a longtime fan, pick this up, you should enjoy it. New fans should stay away for the time being, and get \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Train of Thought.\\"
B00005JMUL|5.0|Saw the movie at the Imax Theater.  It had so much more to it then we expected. The ride on top of the train was as if you were on a roller coaster!  Tom Hanks was an excellent Conductor.  The Santa Claus seemed old world and wonderful.  Finally we have an answer to how Santa's Sleigh is loaded. What fun! The message of the story was perfect for this time of year.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|Iron maiden fans are in a league of their own.  Most of us are truly collectors, you can't have 1 or 2 Maiden CDs in your collection but the whole catalogue!  The same applies for VHS/DVD releases.  The buzz about this release was just so strong.  Disc 1 is all live performances, 1 show with Paul Di'Anno and 2 with Dickinson on lead vocals.  Probably the best of the band when they were hungry and still an opening band.  The Hammersith show is truly amazing, I have no idea why this was never released at the time.  Clive Burr on drums reminds you of what made Maiden strong in the first place, a drummer who played riffs and MADE each song an individual statement. Maiden was never quite the same following his departure.  \\"Live at the Rainbow\\" is a little grainy but better than any bootleg version that we had to find for years at the hands of video \\"specialists\\" on ebay or some pricey import.  The Dortmund show is from German TV from the World Piece Tour, more great stuff, again found only on ebay before this release.  Also, the cameras stay on a band member for a good stretch of time letting the viewer enjoy ths show, unlike the rapid video image fire of \\"Rock in Rio\\".  Disc 1 is well worth the price of admission here but wait, there is disc 2.  I thought this would just be \\"The First 10 Years\\" rereleased on dvd but it is an entirely new  documentary.  Extras include never before seen videos from English TV and another gem, \\"Live at the Ruskin\\" with Di'Anno on vocals from the debut album era days.  This collection is just so unbelievable and I picked mine up at deepdiscountdvd for under $15!  This is truly a great day for us Maiden fans!  If you don't have this, don't walk, Run! 6 stars!
B00005NKKY|5.0|This is S & G at the peak of their powers.  A very experimental record in many ways, and one that succeeds almost completely. As a big fan, I can easily call this my favorite record of theirs.  And it's not a bad entry point for new fans, either.  \\"America\\" alone is worth the price of admission, a stunning song, beautifully arranged and performed here.  But you get so many other gems (\\"Fakin' It\\" and \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" stand out to me).  This expanded version kinda changes the deal by including the outtake \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies\\" (which is interesting but won't set you on fire, probably) and a demo recording of \\"Old Friends\\" (which is valuable why?).  But the packaging is superior to the prior CD release.  You can't really go wrong with any version of this classic!
B00003CXAT|5.0|I loved the first Jurassic Park the best.  It kept moving and was intense.  I do NOT recommend this movie for anyone who has nightmares due to suggestion.  It gave me nightmares and I usually am not effected.  I still watch it again and again though.
B00063EMJ6|3.0|Let me start off by saying I love neil young and all these <br />songs. This would get 5 stars just for the songs, but the <br />reason young released this cd is he's still stalling the  <br />release of his archive box set. This has been going on for <br />3 or 4 years. Meanwhile the fans get screwed. Maybe neil <br />should stop having petty disputes with the label and start <br />thinking about his fans.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It's hard to believe that this could happen to someone and that there are many people out there today with the same problem as Nash.  It's quite scary if you think about it.  A very good movie to see to help understand what someone can go through and try to overcome or at least manage.
0872860175|3.0|Read \\"Howl\\" when I was around 18 and thought it (and still do) a groundbreaking (for various reasons) work.  Twenty years later, I find that I don't praise it as quickly and easily as I used to.  The images Ginsberg created are fantastic and the whole stream of consciousness approach is, more often than not, exhilarating but I sincerely doubt that all those people posting 5 star reviews can honestly tell me what \\"Howl\\" is remotely about.  Art is subjective, I know, and where one person sees a brilliant poetic catharsis another sees a slightly over-rated diatribe, no doubt written while under the influence of some \\"chemical refreshments\\" so popular within the beatnik culture.  I'm aware that \\"Howl\\" doesn't necessarily have to have a \\"meaning\\" (at least not a conventional one) but even employing a surrealist stance and dismissing even the most remote notion of logic, there seems to surface little more than drug induced hallucinations and ravings.  Did \\"Howl\\" push the envelope?  You bet it did.  Did it change how poetry was viewed?  I believe it did that, too.  Is it great poetry?  That's totally personal, but it my opinion it serves more as testament of the culture and age from which it emerged than anything bearing literary merit.
B00001MXXH|5.0|An EXCELLENT movie or teens to adults.  Bueller was made in the 80s, but is still very funny and lovable.  I still think of his teacher calling roll every time someone isn't pressent when their name is called.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|I love Christina. Out of all of her peers (Britney, Jessica, Mandy, --- even Mariah) Christina is, without a doubt, the most talented and gifted singer. (Notice I said 'singer.' She can sing circles around any of those other girls.)<br /><br />Her Christmas album is an acceptable and pleasant first offering from a talent who is still growing into her craft. She has, no doubt, a powerful and expressive voice, and for the most part, her arrangements are good.<br /><br />But the big question that kept coming to mind as I listened to this album was, \\"Where's the producer? Doesn't he/she realize that Christina is out of control on much of this album?\\" While I fully support Christina's right to express herself vocally, there comes a point when the listener just can't take it anymore. It's nearly impossible for me to listen to the whole CD from start to finish because in every song, Christina seems to be trying to top the performance in the previous song.<br /><br />With that said, however, I have to say that my favorite song on the CD is the final remix of The Christmas Song. It makes me want to shake my groove thing every time I hear it... even in the middle of July!<br /><br />Christina has grown and matured as a singer with each CD she has released. I hope she'll try Christmas again in a few years when she understands that, sometimes, less really is more.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|An EXCELLENT movie.  Especially for girls.  Mulan tries her best to always do the right thing and succeeds in the end.  A lot of humor along the way with some really good songs.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This Christmas season \\"Elf\\" is back again, but this time packaged and ready for the small screen on a DVD ready for stocking stuffing. If all that unavoidable shopping you'll be doing in the next month has your holiday spirit waning, just slip in this DVD and prepare yourself for the now familiar styling of comedic actor Will Ferrell (\\"Anchorman\\", \\"Old School\\", \\"Zoolander\\"). The goofy frolicking and outright mind numbing hi-jinks just might be the holiday `pick-me up' needed this season. <br /> <br />Beginning in Santa's workshop, `Elf' quickly falls into the formulaic fish-out-of-water syndrome of most SNL styled movies. Despite its slow beginnings, \\"Elf\\" quickly gains speed as Papa Elf (Bob Newhart-Yes, Bob Newhart!) lays out the constructions of the story to his adopted-human-son Buddy (Will Ferrell). Like most 30 year old men living at home, Buddy decides perhaps it is time to move out and find who he really is. The audience is quickly aware of Buddy's complete lack of elfish ability and when he finds out his true father (James Caan) is on Santa's `naughty list' the gears of the movie begin to turn. In a bound-to-be-disastrous decision, Buddy sets out to find his biological father in New York City.  <br /> <br />Just like any movie framed on the idea of coming to New York-the city tries to eat Buddy alive. In a startlingly funny and thankfully un-previewed series of mishaps Buddy finds his father Walter, a cutthroat children's book publisher, who seems to have lost his way. Through a multitude of misunderstandings between Buddy's new family, his co-workers at the Santa Claus display of a department store, and himself, Buddy finds the true meaning of Christmas. The question of the movie is: Can this man in elf's clothing convince the rest of the world there is still a Christmas to be had? <br /> <br />The true success of this movie is the cast. Ferrell lends what is quickly becoming his typical role, a stubbornly goofy boy in the shape of a man. The tough-guy roles Caan usually plays in movies like \\"The Godfather\\" and now in the NBC television show \\"Las Vegas\\" works out nicely with the dynamic of real life New York and the spoof on life Ferrell seems to create wherever he shows up. Bob Newhart is amazing in body and voice as the adoptive father and all of this packaged by director Jon Favreau (\\"Made\\", \\"Swingers\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Elf\\" is just in time for the holiday season and offers up this year's chance at filling up that empty void of Christmas spirit we all carry around with us. I was originally skeptical, however Will Ferrell earns my respect not only as the lead actor in \\"Elf\\" but as a success in the growing ranks of SNL comedians turned movie stars.    <br />
B000001FDK|5.0|It's a classic.  A movie for almost all ages--not children, but young adults to grandparents.
B0006399FS|4.0|For all those that enjoy Vertigo and long for an album full of crap like that, I feel bad for you. That's not U2, that's not the type of song that's made them who they are. It's them saying, \\"Here's the weakest song on the album, let's get it out as the first single so people don't get mad later on if we release it after, say 'Can't Make It On Your Own' or 'A Man and A Woman'.\\" But the world loved Vertigo, for some odd reason I still can't figure out. And then to read that people are upset because they didn't get an album that sounded like that song is just ridiculous. The rest of the album is U2 as they have always been. Crazy delayed quitar, epic choruses, driving melodies, and always full of emotion. Vertigo is weak, the rest of the album soars. If you want driving hard rock like Vertigo, listen to some other bands. If you want classic U2, simply skip past the first track. Nuff said.
B00005JMUL|5.0|My husband, myself and our 9 year old son really enjoyed this movie.  It was magical and exciting and it tugged at your heart strings all at the same time.  It brought back many childhood memories of the curiosity of Santa and the desire to always believe. May we all hear the bells ring this Christmas.  Go see this movie, it will make you remember what Christmas is truly about.
078681859X|4.0|This book that was recommended to me by my school's librarian. When I looked at it, it seemed rather pointless and chilish and I didn't want to read it. But one of my friends recommended it so I picked it up and began to read it. While I didn't like the prideful, stuck-up Nathaniel, I absolutely loved the djinni Bartimaeus, who was funny and witty and just...cool! I would recommend this book to anyone, but just because of Bartimaes and his escapades.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I browsed amazon earlier today, and came across Madeleine Peyroux. I checked out some of her stuff, and found her beautiful version of Between the bars. <br />Just now, I read the review by the person who heard her music at Barnes&Noble and ended up trying to find out who it was for ages, and I had a sudden revelation. <br />While I was in the US 2 months ago, I also spent some time reading in a Barnes and Noble store in Georgetown, DC, and there was this beautiful jazz music playing. The song was very familiar - Elliott Smith, I just couldn't figure out which one - and the voice too (Billie Holiday?) Afterwards I checked if Mr Smith had done any jazz covers, but to no avail. And now I found it! Small world. Madeleine Peyroux, my new love.. Thanks amazon, thanks B&N, and that person in Florida who had this same revelation... Funny thing.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|As many times and as long as I've seen this title in stores everywhere, this is my first copy of 'Bursting Out' I've ever had. Originally released in 1978, 'Bursting Out' covers classic Tull material from their second lp,which was put out in 1969 through 1977. 'Bursting Out' appears to be the band's 12th actual release. The sound is great as the disc here gives all true Tull fans a chance to re-live or experience maybe for the first time a live Jethro Tull concert. Seems like EVERY music fan you run across usually likes at least one or two Tull albums. As for the tunes, I found myself keeping a sharp ear open for \\"Breaking Away...\\", \\"A New Day Yesterday\\", \\"Bouree\\", \\"Songs From The Woods\\", the unforgettable \\"Thick As A Brick\\", \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\". Line-up on this CD is: Ian Anderson - vocals & flute, Martin Barrie - guitar & mandolin, John Evans - organ & piano, Barriemore Barlow - drums, David Palmer - pipe organ & synthesizers and John Glascock - bass & vocals. Only downside is that \\"Living In The Past\\" isn't on here. That's okay. They can't play everything. Recommended.
B00065JTBA|5.0|This is the best box set ever! I was under the impression that it was just Bon Jovi greatest hits. I had no idea. I was happy to see all my favorite songs in the set, but there were a few songs that I totally forgot about until I heard it. It's so fun to listen to the whole album; it defiantly brought back some memories. The box set also includes this amazing photo album with letters and pictures of the whole band. Some of their outfits and hair from the 80's was totally rad! 5 cds of classic rock! You can't go wrong. Keep an eye out for all the un-released material. There is so much new music, it's like you're getting a whole new Bon Jovi. If you ever liked Bon Jovi, this box set will rock your world.
068987474X|5.0|Are you in need of help with your love life? Are you in and out of one bad relationship after another? Do you always seem to pick the losers? If you answered yes to any of these questions you need this book. He's Just Not That Into You by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo is an amazing book that every woman should read. <br />The book is set up in a very easy to read format. It will show a letter that a woman wrote to Greg and then Greg's response. There will be about five letters in each chapter all relating to one main topics like, he's just not that into you if he's not calling you. At the end of each chapter Liz recaps the chapter and gives a few bits advice from a woman's perspective. Greg follows that up with a review of what you should have learned in that chapter along with an activity that will help you find someone who is perfect for you. The quick to follow format makes this a great book to read if you do not have lots of time. You could easily read a chapter or two and not read the next one for awhile without losing anything.  <br />The information in this book is very helpful for any girl trying to find the love of her life. Greg tells the truth even if it hurts. When girls ask each other for relationship advice nine out of ten times girls will just tell their friend what they want to hear even if it is a big lie. Greg just tells it like it is in a way that women can handle without getting upset. Greg helps the readers understand what guys really mean when they say something common like, \\"I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you.\\" The information presented in this book will help women everywhere to not waste their time with jerks. <br />Aside from being a very informative and helpful book for women, it is extremely entertaining. Greg Behrendt is a comedian who has been on many late night television shows and was a Sex and the City consultant for three years. Liz Tuccillo was the executive story editor for Sex and the City. Both have great sensesof humor and together they are absolutely hilarious. Many times while reading this book I found myself crying from laughing so hard. Even if you do not need relationship advice it would still be a great book to read for a good laugh every once in awhile. The entire book is very amusing yet, true. <br />I would most definitely recommend this book for every woman to read. Reading just one or two chapters could save you from wasting your time in a dead end relationship. Whether you are looking for love or are in a relationship you can learn a lot about men and relationships while having a few good laughs.  <br />
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|No doubt I am happy with the outcome of this DVD set and for sure I will buy it. It will take me back to that day in 1985 when I was glued to the TV until late in the evening. Many people wrote they missed Led Zeppelin on the set. I was not much into that kind of music those days, so don't even remember them. But (if I am right) the Cars also sang: who's gonna drive you home. I absolutely miss that song on the set as it gave me the chills. Furthermore I am surprised to see the US recording of \\"heal the world\\" on the set. Basically none of the \\"stars\\" on that song actually took part during live aid. I was quite irritated and angry that day in 85: where was Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, etc, etc.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless I advise: go and buy it, relive that day and for the young ones I would like to say: look, listen and experience real music. Let's hope it brings in enough money to help those in Darfur <br /> <br />
0312330529|5.0|Talk about being \\"taken on a journey beyond site and sound\\" this self-account of a life that gets swung back and forth from doom to near deity is an epic. As I sit back and glean what I have read over the last week with incredulity I can't help but want to know more about David Roberts' tumultuous life. To use a colloquial Australian term he is a \\"freak of nature\\", achieving the impossible and surviving the darkest recesses mankind has to offer. If I was put in front of the guy I guess I would have to say \\"you are an amazing man\\".
B000068FY1|5.0|Hollywood Town Hall is not your average record.   <br /> <br /> <br />It is a timeless gem that has a very cohesive ambience making it one of the most storied and warming American records of all time. <br /> <br />From the soaring guitars of \\"Nevada California\\", to the lament of \\"Martins Song\\", Hollywood Town Hall is an American masterpiece. <br /> <br />For the first time listeners, beware. This record at first may seem like simple bar band rock, or the different vocals may turn you off. The unique vocals are part of what give this music it's magic. It took me a few months of having this cd to \\"get it\\". Most listeners are use to perfectly mainstream voices, and perfect placement of parts in all the songs in a neat paint by numbers order.  The Jayhawks instead come to their song writing conclusions in a roundabout, behind the back flourishing fashion. They are magicians of songcraft.  <br /> <br /> <br />Simply one of the best American rock/pop band recordings of all time.
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck was the book I read for learning more about the 1930's decade and was a very interesting book to me, and overall helped me understand more about the Great Depressions and what it was about.  I'll admit I wasn't too excited about reading The Grapes Of Wrath, but to be honest I liked it a lot.  To be honest, I did not know a whole lot about the Great Depression, just some of the really general, easy facts that most people know, or at least I would hope knew.  I knew when it was, how the stock market crashed, and how there were very few jobs available.  This book helped me understand what the depression was all about because it gave me a personal tale of someone living during this particular time in history.  The main character, Tom, is released from jail and goes back to his family farm.  After being gone for four years, he realizes most of his neighbors have disappeared, and one of the town preachers tells him that everyone went to California to find jobs.  So Tom and his family travel over there, even though it takes forever because everyone is on the same highway to California, they eventually make it.  As they arrive at California, one of the immigrants tells the Joad family that there are barely any jobs and throughout the rest of the book, they struggle to make money and keep their family alive throughout this hardship.<br /><br />For me, it is hard to imagine that a personal story like this was probably very common for families during the 1930's.  It was sad to read that many of Tom's relatives actually died on the trip over to California because the conditions were so rough.  Before I read this book, I thought there were some similarities between the depression and all the job losses going on right now, but now I cannot even compare them because they are so different.  Sure, people have lost a lot of their jobs right now, and although that may be tragic for that single family, it is nothing like what happened in the late 20's and early 30's.  Families had no means of getting food for themselves because in the book it talked about how many of the factory owners were scared of a workers strike, so they made sure that there weren't many jobs for them to have.<br /><br />Later on in The Grapes of Wrath, it explained how when the Joads were done picking for cotton season, they must return home to find work, but rumors around the country were that there wasn't going to be any jobs at all for the next three months.  That may not seem like a lot, but 90 days is along time with no income.  I was so interested after I read this book because it made me really appreciate everyone who lived through that tough time and made it out stronger.  We should not judge any single person, or their past, because unless we are put in the exact same situation, we can't really have an informed opinion on it.  I think from this book I realized how many really hard years that our country went through, and that it is all worth it because it can only make us stronger and give everyone hope to make things right again in the future. Personally I would recommend this book to anyone.and early 30's.

B00003CXDV|4.0|When the entertainment industry pokes fun at itself sincerely, the results can be hilarious.  Such is the case with the cornball science fantasy movie \\"Galaxy Quest.\\"<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest\\" was a science fiction television show with more than a passing similarity to \\"Star Trek.\\"  As with the latter show, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" was cancelled.  Now the dispirited actors seem doomed to an endless cycle of overzealous fans at \\"Galaxy Quest\\" conventions.  Adding to the actor's torment is the attitude of Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the show.  Nesmith's cheery attitude and self-importance have worn thin on his fellow cast mates, Gwen Demarco as sexy Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane as brainy Dr. Lazarus (Alan Rickman), and Fred Kwan as Tech Sgt. Chen (Tony Shalhoub).<br /><br />Interrupting their doldrums is a group of individuals who would appear weird to anyone outside a science fiction convention.  As members of the convention they appear to be about as strange, or normal, depending on your point of view, as anyone else.  However, Jason Nesmith soon learns that this strange foursome is more than they seem as they spirit him off to their genuine spaceship, NSEA Protector.<br /><br />At first Jason is somewhat excited at the opportunity to be on a genuine spaceship, and eventually brings the rest of the crew, including bit part player Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), back to the ship with him.  However, the aliens crewing the ship, the Thermians, have a very real, very ruthless nemesis to contend with, and the former crew of \\"Galaxy Quest\\" discover they are out of their depth.<br /><br />The Thermians brought the crew of \\"Galaxy Quest\\" on board because they discovered certain \\"historical documents\\" that were transmitted into space many years earlier.  The somewhat innocent, though highly intelligent and creative, Thermians were unable to recognize the television show \\"Galaxy Quest\\" as being make-believe.<br /><br />The movie moves forward with a number of creative and often humorous moments, alternating between hilarity and seriousness, with even a few moments of compassion.

B00065JTBA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bon Jovi's and so I know their music well.....but I had no idea what to expect for this box set.  I knew when I bought it that it included all the songs that never made it on the albums, and was curious to see what such a great band like Bon Jovi had done throughout the years without all of us knowing.  And they didn't let me down!!  Generally the best of the best make released albums....but they left out songs that are really awesome that are included in the box set.  It's like rediscovering the band all over again with 4 new cds.  I recommend this box set to all Bon Jovi fans and listeners.
0451527046|5.0|Treasure Island is arguably one of the greatest works of storytelling in the English language. Stevenson created other novels, with greater depth and insight, but the highlight of Treasure Island is the combination of color and poetic prose that distinguishes his tale of piracy and boyhood adventure from the rest of the field of other adventure books. The title alone paints an image of suspense, and salty pirates battling over great riches. Most people tend to view Treasure Island as a story for children, but it can be enjoyed by anyone longing for a rollicking adventure. Like so many stories from the 1800s, each chapter ends with a cliffhanger, and once you get used to the language the author's humor shines through.
B000002J09|5.0|The day Led Zeppelin needs a review from me to influence someone's purchase is a strange day indeed.  This is a lot like saying \\"Rock is good.\\"  Led Zeppelin was a magic band that spewed definitive rock their entire history.  This album, the darkest, is my favorite.  For you LotR geeks out there, this is also the album in which you get to hear songs inspired by Tolkien.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|A number of years ago I attended a Neil Young concert at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in which Young sang accompanied only by the guitar he himself played.<br /><br />This, I thought at the time, was a pretty daring feat in that Young is not known for his voice, and his voice would certainly be front and center this night.<br /><br />Any artist singing practically a capella is taking major risks because often it is the band that fills in the musical gaps, adds the musical exclamation points or is just loud enough to make the singer part of the overall sound rather the focal point. But this night, Young was alone with his childlike voice and his uncanny talent for writing songs that tear at your heart and sometimes even bring tears to your eyes.<br /><br />That night was a transcendent experience: three thousand people enthralled, sitting in Red Velvet seats usually occupied by those who come to this hall to hear the Los Angeles Philharmonic or the Los Angeles Opera. We listened. We were moved. We left drained.<br /><br />\\"Neil Young Greatest Hits\\" is a revelation in that every single song is a gem: no filler, no duets with Frank Sinatra, pure Neil Young...unadulterated and uncensored.<br /><br />Like Joni Mitchell and Laura Nyro, to name a couple, Young is real, he is humble, he is truthful, and he only wants to tell his stories. Listening to these 16 songs you realize that in the process of writing and performing them, Young is not just singing lyrics and plucking at his guitar, he is laying out his heart and his soul on a table and is demanding that we carve off a small piece of each to cherish and keep with us forever.
B00030590I|5.0|If you don't understand Chinese language, stay away from this version and look for a mainland Chinese version. The subtitles are more accurate. Political correctness has crept into the subtitles of the Miramax version and you will get an incorrect idea of the story line. <br /> <br />To those who claim that this is a Chinese propaganda film, you are just spouting anti-China propaganda about a culture you know nothing about. <br /> <br />
B0002SROT0|4.0|It's a long stretch to call E.Smith a genius or apply any other heavy epithet. It's needless. He built a name for himself because his songs had a characteristic way to strike a chord with many people. Where other songmakers also delved in this kind of ballad-centered music, Smith's uniqueness was in his knack to master melancholy like few do.  <br /> <br />    His untimely and full of questions death leaves a vacuum and that can't be denied. And this, his last recording, will be a rather macabre way for people out there to discover an artist who couldn't be commercial no matter what the stakes were but who kept a dedicated and increasing following with what we used to call \\"indie\\" music.. <br /> <br />   Some reviewers claim that \\"..from a basement on the hill\\" is more guitar-driven but to me it's a typical Smith album, one that has his trademark ethereal and autumnlike moments. It's an album that gets to you more and more as you keep listening to it. Like most of his albums did to begin with. <br /> <br />   Strictly musically speaking, he has perhaps written better songs, but it's his peculiar and never-changing gloomy atmosphere that counts. <br /> <br />   Surely this type of mood wont appeal to most, it's not even intended for most, and this is why he couldn't have appealed to a wider audience. No matter. Not everything is intended for everyone or is accessible to anyone. As far as music expressing different frequencies of the spectrum of feelings and intelligence goes E.Smith was in a way like L.Cohen is. And that is a compliment in itself if you know what i mean. <br /> <br />    Do yourself a favor and listen to his earlier solo albums. If you're the type for such music you wont be let down even if he himself ultimately was... <br />
B000002JS8|4.0|I put Highway To Hell right next to Back In Black as AC/DC'S finest album. This album has some of my favorites like the title track with it's classic simple riff, Walk All Over You (great chorus), Touch Too Much (great vocals by Bon!), Shot Down In Flames (cool lyrics), Get It Hot (a simple catchy song), and If You Want Blood (great chorus). It annoys me that some people criticize AC/DC saying their music is too simple. But I challenge those clowns to come up with a cool catchy riff or a great chorus that sticks in your head like AC/DC has done time and again. It's a shame that Bon passed away but at least he went out with a classic album!
B000002IZ4|5.0|This is what a real american rock and roll band in this times has to be, no GNR sounds , no hair looks , not that lack of ambition for experimentation that the bands in the old concept of \\"rock star\\" were afraid to offer because they didnt wanted to jeopardize fame and mostly money they won (that era ended anyway) STP liked to mix blues, with hard rock, and alternative sounds with classic rock and roll, they incorporated all kind of percussions and acoustic and electric strings, piano sometimes, when it was about getting hard they sounded visceral, never overproduced, and never totally digitalized, lyrics were so crazy and bizarre sometimes as good rock and roll bands has to express, they were never worried about doing stupidly pretencious videos like GNR with girls , fancy cars , expensive weedings etc, etc,and GNR were a terrific band but some concepts they tried to show were so ridiculous, STP were a real rock and roll band i repeat and i find extrange scott weiland asociation with ex guns to form Velvet Revolver anyway, you need to listen \\"purple\\" wich is their best album, and you gona agree with me  <br />HM
B00008CLOA|5.0|This CD is incredible from start to finish. You've probably read most fo the other reviews that state this as being one of the best CD's of all time. And they would be right. <br />From the lyrics in Time, to the voice on Great Gig In The Sky, to the crescendo at the end of the CD in Eclipse, this is one that everyone should own. <br />I think it's impossible to explain this CD, so i suggest you find a copy and listen to it, and see what you think.  <br />It's just one of those rare CD's where everything comes together. I don't think you could find a more complete album. <br />And if you liked this CD, then try Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  <br />Finally, anyone who says Pink Floyd is not music, should not be trusted. This is, if anything, one of the pinnacles of modern music. <br />So give it a listen, and see what you think.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is just the start of Slipknot's new \\"stuff\\" as some of you like to call it.  Most of you are too ignorant to take in new materials, you put down this CD because it is different.  Two of the songs had huge impacts on my life, and how I looked at some things.  Though they some what lack the \\"hard core\\" music we desire, their next CD already has plans for the heavy metal theme, as well as their new material, as displayed on Volume 3: The subliminal Verses.  The hard work, dedication, and effort really shows off in this CD, and I suggest every person ready this pick the CD up, and experience the greatness of this CD.
038551123X|3.0|Lindsay has created an innovative plot and a most surprising hero. Dexter is a serial killer who because of the intervention of his policeman adoptive father has become different than your typical serial killer. The father challenged his killing instincts and directed those same instincts into somewhat more \\"noble\\" paths. Thus, Dexter only kills those serial killers who have done evil. Makes an interesting twist to \\"an eye for an eye.\\"  <br /> <br />The plot concerns his hunt for an enigmatic serial killer who is frighteningly similar to Dexter himself. The ending strains one's credibility; at least this reader's. <br /> <br />The writing is witty and it is certainly possible that this author will improve over the course of future books. <br />

B00006RAKP|4.0|Elton John has been around a very long time, long enough to put out multiple greatest hits packages (III was released in 1987, a \\"Very Best of\\" Import released at the same time as the box set, yet no Vol.4, which would've made up the 90s-era output.  <br />At the rate he's gone in the past 15 years, he's going to have to put out a SECOND box set to continue \\"To Be Continued\\".  <br /> <br />What's good about this release is that it wraps up 30 plus years in a 2 CD package (although with Peachtree Road, there are already 2-4 songs that would've been great additions). In a way, it might have been a good idea to have held off releasing this one..  <br /> <br />This collection is great for those who grew up listening to Elton in the 70s on the radio,watched him in the 80s on MTV, and the fans of \\"Lion King\\" in the 90s.The entire first CD is full of the hits people remember, although not everything from \\"Greatest Hits I and II\\" make it.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 goes from mid-70s smash \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" into one 1980 song (Little Jeannie) then into \\"I'm Still Standing\\" from 1983. 5 more songs from the 80s are represented, and then with \\"The One\\" into \\"Something About The Way You Look Tonight\\",one selection from \\"Aida\\" (Written in the Stars) is about 6 songs. \\"I Want Love\\" and \\"This Train..\\" represent \\"Songs from the West Coast\\". Overall, it's jam packed with a lot of great songs.  <br /> <br />However Elton at some point should put out a \\"singles collection\\" that would be different from the box set already out. It comes out to another 30-plus songs. SOME of the songs that were missing are: Lady Samantha, Border Song, Friends, Step Into Xmas, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,  Whatever Gets You Through The Night (Elton's voice is so prominent on there, it belongs on one of his collections), Part Time Love,  <br /> Chloe, Empty Garden, Blue Eyes, Wrap Her Up, Nikita, A Word in Spanish, Club at the End of the Street, Healing Hands, Simple Life, and The Last Song, The Heart of Every Girl, Original Sin,  and Answer in the Sky.  <br /> <br />A 2 DVD collection would be a great way to fit all the songs he did over the years in one place, as most of what he did has been filmed. They really need to put more of the older material out to show how he developed as a live artist, which is just as important as the songs here. \\"Dream Ticket\\" doesn't really cover it enough.  <br /> <br />Another release I'd like to see is one where Elton and Bernie pick out their own personal favorites, similar to Brian Wilson's own collection of Beach Boys classics released a couple of years ago, where it's more about the songs themselves than the hits... \\"Two Rooms\\" is a great collection of different artists covering Elton and Bernie's songs.  <br /> <br />Finally, Jeff Buckley covered two songs (Curtains and We All Fall In Love Sometimes off of Capt. Fantastic, hopefully they'll be officially released one day..you HAVE to hear Jeff sing them.) that really made me rediscover Elton's early 70s-era stuff, all of which up to Blue Moves are essential.   <br />  <br />Even though it's not the definitive collection of his \\"greatest hits\\", it's 2 1/2 hours of wall to wall classics.
B000687M48|5.0|Evanescence proves that they are just as good live as in the studio with this release. Amy sounds great and the band sounds equally amazing. The concert footage is what makes this performance even better, I like the way the camera doesn't just focus on Amy. As intoxicating as she is, I would rather see the entire band doing what they do best. The setlist is also great, in which they play all of their hits, and everything in between. The cover of Korn's Thoughtless is what stands out the most in my mind. Adding the piano to that song was a nice touch. Also Farther Away was done perfectly, and the added jam session to the end of it was a good call on the band's half.<br /><br />The extra features are a thing to behold too. The footage shows you what the band is like when they're not on stage, and it's nice to see that they're not depressed all the time. It shows everything from their rehearsal to Amy playing ping pong while on roller skates. Another \\"perk\\" is that you also get to see the band Seether in the clips also. I found that the bloopers satisfied me the most when it comes to the footage as a whole.<br /><br />Putting all of the band's music videos together is also a great touch to this already magnificent DVD. As you probably know there are 4 videos in all which are Bring Me To Life, Going Under, My Immortal, and Everybody's Fool. While I like all the videos my personal favorite is Everybody's Fool since it's so unlike anything Evanescence has done.<br /><br />A few of the best songs are Thoughtless, Farther Away, Missing, and Imaginary. All of the songs are performed perfectly, and of course they're all great. The bonus CD included is also a good listen, so definitely make a point to check this out.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|There is nothing better then owning a Greatest Hits album.  And it gets even better when the artist is Shania Twain.  Every single one of her chart-topping hits combined in one album is AMAZING!!!  For any Shania fan, or country music fan, this is definately an album you should consider buying if you don't own it already.
B000002J09|5.0|This album is my therapy. No matter my mood, it makes me feel better. My mom introduced me to Stairway to Heaven when I was 12 or 14, and I would play the local Classical Rock station all the time JUST to hear that song again (yes, I am young). Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham are/were all artists. Their songs are polished, meaningful, and sublimely beautiful, but they don't tell you what to think or how to interpret them. They require the listener to bring something to what they hear and to participate in the music. Led Zeppelin seemed to have put a lot more thought and soul into their work than many other artists did or do.
B00030590I|4.0|HERO is Yimou Zhang's first attempt at a martial arts film - and the novelty shows.  As the featurettes explain, he dreamed of making a sword film, searched for a story, and finally wrote his own story that would allow him to express his excitement about the genre.<br /><br />So, the story is minimal - Nameless Hero (Jet Li) gradually approaches the King of the province Qin as he relates how he protected the King from potential assassins.  The film is done in flashbacks to show how Nameless Hero accomplished his feats.  In the end a plot is revealed that brings the movie to an odd resolution.  And that is really all the story is about.<br /><br />The beauty here is in the choices of various colors to depict the various stages of Nameless Hero's quest: oranges become yellows become reds become greens become whites, etc.  The settings are placed within the vast deserts of China and in palace courtyards. The costumes and settings are magically lush and stunningly beautiful.  The action is the expected highly choreographed martial arts sequences that appear more like ballet than fighting.  The huge supporting casts of armies are amazingly well staged with epic action and surreal results.<br /><br />The overall message is about the way the once divided China of 2000 years ago became united into what is called 'the Land'.  That is really all we have as far as directorial message mission.  It matters little that the acting is minimal and wooden, that the use of flashbacks and revised flashforwards leaves some mystery as to which of the characters have been killed on several occasions (!).  The pleasure is in the looking - and this is a beautiful, active piece of art to watch.<br /><br />Grady Harp
0142000663|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a book that I really did enjoy.  A couple of years ago I took the trip west that they talked about in the book.  I went with my uncle who actually grew up on the pan handle in Oklahoma and took route 66 to California.  A book that he suggested that I should read was The Grapes of Wrath.  At first glance I did not want to just because of the size of the book.  But I really wanted to see why he thought this book was so good.  While reading the book I could really understand what the characters were going through.  My uncle still has relatives in Oklahoma and we went to visit them on their farm.  Comparing them to the characters in the book, I would say that the farming in that state has not gotten any better.  My uncles' childhood home had fallen to the ground, and it just showed me how everyone really did just pack all that they had and left.  John Steinbeck really emphasized the emotions that the Joad family went through.  What kept me reading was wanting to know how the next leg of their journey would be and if I had been where Steinbeck was talking about. I felt like while the Joad family traveled through each state on their way to California I could relate to the same adventure.  I remember going through Arizona and feeling the dry heat in the desert, or stopping at a  Now that there are only pieces of route 66 left I could not get the whole affect of taking their trip, but I feel that I have taken a trip with the Joads now.  If you really get into this book listen to \\"Get Your Kicks On Route 66\\" by Nat King Cole.
B00006L3O9|3.0|\\"Doesn't quite sound right,\\" was my first impression of this disk, even though I had a great expectation when I bought the disk for extra money.  <br />If K-2 CD version sounded that good, I wonder what SACD would bring. So, I had to compare this SACD version versus JVC K-2 coded CD on my cheaper end of hi-end hi-fi system. To my ears, K-2 version sounded better. K-2 version offers higher and brighter tone than this SACD version, which offered much lower and subdued tone (one might say \\"deeper\\") of music. I must say the difference was rather large. The quietness (S/N ratio) of the background is the same on both disks.  Overall, I could enjoy the music more with K-2 version, which is priced in the middle of conventional CD and SACD versions. This is mystery, because Bill Evans SACDs from the same label sound definitely better than K-2 CD version.   <br />For jazz classic like this, there is no need for hybrid, when everybody has CD version already.

B0000024JA|5.0|I think that this is the best Wu-Tang and Method Man solo album. This is when Meth and RZA were in their prime. I believe this album is very underrated. I admit the first time I listened to it I wasn't feeling it. After another spin I realize that this is a classic. Every track on here is stellar. My personal favorite song is \\"Sub Crazy\\", I noticed I haven't seen anyone else mention it. All of Method Man's other solo albums don't come close to this record. They are too mainstream, too many freatured artists, too poppy, etc. This album is more grimey and hardcore. When you are listening to it you can just picture the streets, violence, crime and drugs. Other stand out tracks are Meth vs. Chef, What the Blood Clot?, and Mr. Sandman. This is one of my favorite hip hop albums, and I am really picky when it comes to hip hop.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I can see why seasons one and two were released together -- no one would buy season one on its own, with a scant five episodes from a comedy troupe that only started finding its voice four episodes into the second season. While \\"Seinfeld\\" may have been cutting edge when it aired, the first two seasons and particularly the first eight episodes look very 1980s and lack punch. Perhaps that is because shows like \\"Friends\\" and \\"Sex and the City\\" picked up where \\"Seinfeld\\" left off and pushed the envelope even further. But as a collector's item, this box set is priceless -- especially for the bonus material in which its founders explain how the writers managed to make the scripts tighter and funnier and how Jerry, Elaine and the other stars found their voices. In all fairness, as a documentary in this set explains, it was next to impossible to develop the show's characters until the second season because NBC ordered the pilot, then several months later ordered four more shows and only later decided to order 13 episodes. So with the uncertainty, I suppose it's remarkable that the show ever made it.

0452282152|2.0|There should have been a warning on the cover.  This is not an Amadeus-like work, which creates a lively back story for some artist's magnum opus.  No...this is more like those books that teen girls are supposed to read that tell them what is was like \\"for a girl your age\\" back in \\"Colonial times\\" or whatever.  The truly boring aspects of late 17th century Dutch life are described in amazing detail (you boiled your cap in potato peelings? Wow!), but about Vermeer we learn next to nothing.  The \\"muse\\" maid, Griet, impresses the Master because she segregates chopped vegetables by color and can be taught how to grind pigments.  Pages and pages are devoted to Griet's skillful navigation of the matriarchal politics of the Vermeer household, while Herr Vermeer has had the good sense to get out of the house (and out of the narrative).  The obsession with domestic drudgery and female power plays will tend to alienate the male reader, subtly reinforcing the stereotype that women like pretty things but have no sophistication when it comes to the visual arts.  Perhaps the film made from this book was a better bet.  Even a tedious story set in a recreated 17th century Dutch world should be fun to watch.
B0000CGV00|4.0|I'm of the school of thought that believes it amply demonstrable that with few exceptions the work of modern composers is utterly unlistenable junk, an aesthetic reflection of the philosophic disintegration of the late 20th century.  (N.B. - I'm also one who flatly refuses to sugar-coat a review for the populist sake of \\"helpful\\" votes...)  Like all of my past experiences with \\"modern\\" composers, the two here showed up unexpectedly during the course of my partaking of more familiar territory.  The lineup of two of Beethoven's less-frequently performed works with two composers I hadn't heard before held the promise of an interesting disc - and in both positive and negative senses \\"Credo\\" does not disappoint.     From the first bars of Corigliano's Fantasia I knew I was indeed ingesting the work of A Modern, evident in its creepy foretelling of that horrible piano bit from the Kubrick \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" soundtrack.  For its fashionably irrationalist aesthetic it actually retains structure and a kind of brooding theme, though melody is banished as a matter of course.  Grimaud performs the piece with as much passion and sensitivity as the composition allows, but after the first fitful third of the piece, in which it nearly rises to the level of conceptual meaning, it evaporates into an extended, yawn-inducing whisper, as if exhausted at the effort.     The abrupt transition to Beethoven's Tempest Sonata comes as an exuberant shock - the emergence from a confused fog into the brilliant art of a master.  Here is the beauty of human rationality in one of its highest possible expressions - here is discipline; compositional virtuosity made seemingly effortless; multilayered complexity of structure that is nonetheless uncluttered and agile; powerful melody and harmony - as if to say \\"THIS is how music is done.\\"     Though the liner notes indicate clearly that it was not Grimaud's conscious intention, the placement of the work of one of the great masters between two moderns provides a veritable textbook lesson on the stark contrast between art and anti-art.  To be charitable though, Corigliano's piece does not descend to the militant nihilism of Part's and therefore cannot be placed in the same aesthetic class.  With its proximity to Beethoven on this disc it comes across as the work of an apprentice with perhaps good intentions but lacking the ability to translate a promising idea into an accessible and fully realized final form.  It's not particularly good, but it is listenable.     Part's \\"Credo\\" on the other hand... To call it awful would be superfluous - it is so aggressively horrible that it's actually entertaining.  It could be described as the sound you'd hear if the inmate of an asylum for the profoundly insane were to decide abruptly that he had become a classical composer, and were given the tools to act upon the notion.  There is a hazard in speculating that the \\"composer\\" was consciously aiming at raucous laughter, in that the assumption carries with it the horrifying possibility of the alternative - and after a couple of steps down that road the mind tends to seize up in defense of sanity.     \\"Credo\\" is, again, actually enjoyable in that several moments are laugh-out-loud hilarious in their awfulness.  I'm at several listens through, and at virtually every turn I expect to hear a Dan Ackroyd voiceover: \\"This is Leonard Pinth-Garnell with...'Bad Symphony'.\\"  Grimaud, conductor Salonen, the choir and orchestra all acquit themselves of the task of reproducing the mess in fine form, but a superbly-done painting of a trash heap for all its craftsmanship cannot escape its subject matter.     Mr. Pinth-Garnell might describe it thusly:     \\"After a deceptively conventional choral intro which transitions into some impressively bad atonality, poor Ms. Grimaud attempts to play a little simple Bach, but is repeatedly accosted and beaten into silence by a series of cacophonous moans from the choir, each followed immediately by the soundof the orchestra being pushed down a short stairwell.  A brief transitional phase, presumably titled 'Generalized Choral Psychosis,' gives way to a dramatic conflict between flatulent tubas and panic-stricken trumpets, followed by an interlude in which all present are evidently instructed to 'insert earplugs and play two minutes of whatever happens to pop into your heads, as loud as you can, simultaneously.'  After the mania, the depression - which at this point we in the audience share deeply - is given voice by a sullen and defeated piano passage.  The chorus, in triumphant response, chooses for its climax to quote with exquisite awfulness those bald, cave-dwelling cultists from 'The Planet of the Apes' from their classic: 'Mass for the Doomsday Bomb.' This crescendo is capped with a denouement graced with a profound blandness evocative of the closing credits for a Discovery Channel documentary on coastal erosion.\\"     I highly recommend the disc, for the entertainment and educational value of its equally-spectacular highs and lows.       Relevant Quote of the day:     \\"Waiter...can you stop that noise? What you call 'music.' It sounds like dirty water.     \\"How can they eat food - and listen to ****?  And look out there...the uglification of the world.   The only place we can find beauty is if its persecutors have overlooked it... I can't stand it.\\"     - Sabina (Lena Olin) in \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\"

B0001HLVS2|5.0|Those who are looking for a movie about nineteenth century sea battles or an accurate page torn from history will likely be disappointed with MASTER AND COMMANDER - THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.  While the story is staged on a British ship, the H.M.S. Surprise, it is all about the people on board.<br /><br />It's a story of friendship and about the pride that nearly destroys it.  This movie speaks to the dynamics of how people interact under various conditions ranging from life and death struggles to the benign and beautiful experience that comes as the result of inquisitive discovery.<br /><br />Juxtaposed here are Captain Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) and his friend and the ship's doctor Dr. Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany).  The former is a man of war and of duty while the latter seems to be on the voyage more to be near his friend and to discover new lands and new creatures than to attend to the mission at hand: intercepting and capturing the French ship, The Acheron.<br /><br />As I watched these two it seemed at times that I was watching an episode of the original television classic, Star Trek, only, instead of William Shatner and DeForest Kelly in their respective roles as Captain James T. Kirk and Leonard H. \\" Bones\\" McCoy, Crowe and Bettany are the ones on the screen.  I half expected Bettany's character, during one of the many heated exchanges with Crowe's, to exclaim, \\"Damn it Jack! Talk to these boys!\\"<br /><br />Enjoy the movie for its masterful portrayal of the dynamics of human emotions and relations and for the dialogue and interaction between two of the finest actors of our day!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B0001ADAVK|1.0|To the overly sexist reviewer: Any guy that looks to a movie for advice on how women think or how to interact with them should go crawl back under their rock.<br /><br />I don't think this is a \\"chick flick\\" at all.  The plot was noble, how a professor gets her conservative students in an all-female college to think outside of the bubble of getting married (an idea still considered to be ideal for everyone, even though half of American marriages end up in divorce), but the way it was acted out was boring and the story was all over the place.  (Julia Roberts has gone downhill since \\"Flatliners\\").<br /><br />Certainly not Oscar material and not memorable at all.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If the repulsive egotist and hypocrite Mel Gibson is a prime example of Christianity, I'm more proud than ever to be an atheist. <br /> <br />I'd just like to point out to the zealots who are calling this a worldwide phenomenon - certain parts of the USA may have gone ga-ga over this film, but it was a FLOP in the UK, Ireland (surprisingly) and most of northern Europe.
B0006399FS|4.0|I did enjoy this albumn but it was a bad attempt at trying to get their classic sound back.  The lyrics were there, the guitar sound was there and even the drumming was there, but it just seemed as though they tried to hard to sound like Joshua Tree.  I am not saying that this is a bad albumn, it is a lot better then some of U2 90's stuff but it was just missing the passion of the original U2.  I would have to put this albumn right on the level All That You Can't Leave Behind, good deserving four stars but not the greatest.  This is a must own albumn for any U2 fan but for the music collector or lover, I would go for Joshua Tree, that is classic U2.
6304708521|5.0|Give four guys more fame than God, more money than the Pope, and more drugs than Keith Richards, what do they do? Make the most awesome trip movie ever conceived by man. If you get into altered states of conciousness, such as acid or shrooms, then you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film. I've had this movie since I was young, and I always thought it was great, just rather nonsensical in a \\"Oh, those Beatles\\" sorta way. The first time I took a trip with this movie, all I kept thinking over and over was \\"I finally understand...\\" So, have you ever been experienced?
B00005JMUL|5.0|This movie was just SPECTACULAR, my favorite of the year and I would even say of the past couple of years.  The animation is new, different, life-like and most of all beautiful.  The story of believing in things not seen, but true, was endearing and something so many people need to learn, not just during the holidays but the whole year through.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was wonderful as the conductor, and as the hobo too.  He is a talented performer and keeps proving this time and again, especially in the Polar Express.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much of the movie away so I won't provide the details, but I will say this...as soon as I was finished seeing it I wanted to see it again.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it touched my heart.  A masterpiece and an instant classic!

Keep your mediocre voice in the recording studio where they can jazz it up by computer. Oh yeah and that song lets get retarded? too late you allready are. That song is retarded, speaking of witch its not a word that should be used lightly. Plus the whole song stinks. Oh yeah you really thought hard about the lyrics didnt you. Lets get retarded ha, lets get retarded in here, lets get retarded ha, lets get retarded in here, woo hoo ha woo hoo in here woo hoo ha woo hoo in here. Wow you really had a brainstorm, oh woops i cant say that because it can refer to epileptic children and it would be thoughtless of me. Well, no more then your cd is. The black eyed peas should go back in their pods and sent into the sun.
B000089RV6|5.0|I wasn't going to review this cd, because most people already know it's a classic. However it seems as though not a lot of people know where they originated from. First of all, none of the band members in AC/DC have any ties to the U.S or Texas for that matter. The majority of the band members were born in Scotland/England and Phil Rudd/Mark Evans (early member) were born in Melbourne, Australia. Despite this AC/DC grew up in and became an Australian based band in Melbourne, but had ties in Adelaide and Perth.  <br /> <br />As for the cd, there's not really a lot to say about it that hasn't already been said before. It's by far Brian's best effort, and is one of the best Australian cds ever released. I would recommend that the remastered version is purchased, as the sound quality is a lot better and also has enhanced links to additional extras via their website.  <br /> <br />Oh..and please don't ever compare Limp Bizkit/Korn to Black Sabbath and AC/DC again, thanks.
B000006NPY|1.0|Yowsa, what the hell is this??? I have heard my share of god awfull voices but this one really takes the biscuit. This is the first and las SP cd i will ever buy. See, i bought this on a spontanious impulse since i heard they were good. Well i punished myself thouroughly for it i can assure you. Oh ive tried to like it i really have but i hate his voice with a pasion. Infact ithink its worse then a britney spears cd. This voice should only be used when calling your loved one my sweet little lamb chop, or some other moronic lovey dovey name. This cd will be at the back of my collection for a long time, maybe ill give it a try in a couple of years. No! thats way too soon, anyone want to buy it off me for a pound? <br />Ta ra
0739313118|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Its a great story: good characters, fast-paced, and a quick read. Its detailed religious mythology reminded me a bit of the Indiana Jones series. Every chapter ends with a cliffhanger though, which can feel a little artificial after a while. Overall I'd say: worth taking on that long plane ride.

0812550706|5.0|There are lots of good SF writers out there. I've seen pretty good recent stuff from Vernor Vinge, John Steakley (Armor), and others. Even veterans like Larry Niven and Joe Haldemen still put out good yarns.<br /><br />But nothing since Ender's Game was published in 1985 is as good. You have to go back to Heinlein and early Niven/Pournelle to find stuff this good - and there are darn few examples even then.<br /><br />Winner of a Hugo and a Nebula, genesis of an entire series of books (8 so far and still counting), this book is a case study in how to write great SF. Great story, great characters, fluid style, and a superb twist at the end. All that, and it still appeals to an age range from bright ten year olds to mature adults. (My son read this book at age ten and loved it. He's since worked through the Ender's Shadow series, and the only series he likes better is Harry Potter.)<br /><br />I buy extra copies of Ender's Game when I see it at the used book store, and give it to anyone I find who likes SF but hasn't read it. I've never had a disappointed recipient.<br /><br />Essentials - the main character is Ender Wiggin, and we start when he's six, and just being taken to Battle School, where Earth's brightest are trainied for a war with alien enemies. They've already attacked twice, and mankind was very lucky to survive last time.<br /><br />Battle School is rigorous, but a new standard is needed for Ender, the smartest and most capable student the school has ever had. The adults, who know they are not as smart as Ender, try to use their experience to plot a course to make him the best commander the world has ever seen.<br /><br />The other students range from close to Ender (Bean) to borderline incompetent. And Ender has to learn to deal with his own nature as well as the challenges posed by other students in the mock battles that form the biggest part of the school's curriculum.<br /><br />You'll find yourself immersed in his journey. Look, if you check my other reviews, you'll see a lot of lukewarm ones. You'll also see some high ratings, but the only other book I've gushed over like this is The Mote in God's Eye. Ender's Game is that good. Thank goodness that a movie effort is underway, with Orson Scott Card's involvement. Done right, it will be a megahit.if you check my other reviews, you'll see a lot of lukewarm ones.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I surely agree with most of the comments said about the movie not including details of the main story of the Trojan War. I too have read the Iliad and Odyssey and many parts have not been considered for the movie (if you think of the Iliad and Odissey, you would practically need it to be a soap opera to consider the whole story). Down to the main point I wanted... there is a teaser trailer for the movie, the first one that appeared, where the scene when Helen and Paris meet in her room and she practically takes off the dress she's wearing down to the sides of her shoulders and is different in framing closeup. In this scene you would practically be able to see her both bosoms if the scene of the teaser wouldn't have been cut. I just bought the movie and the scene is practically closed up in frame and can you only see the third part area of her chest (not able to see the things that in the beginning would lead you to buy the movie and see Diane Krueger's bosoms). Does any one know if there is another version (uncut, unmodified) of the movie?. You can see this teaser I'm talking about in quicktime web page in the movie trailers page. <br />Salutations!

0671027387|5.0|If you want to read a real hard-core page turner - you got it right here. Dark state institutions working in the underground and who pursue their \\"political\\" aims even at the cost of deception and murder with the support of people in the highest places, settings that range from the Arctic ice fields to the warm, shark infested waters of the Atlantic Ocean, and the dangerous jungles of Washington DC, and a handful of brave characters that fight the evil constitute a breathtaking plot with exciting twists and unexpected turns. There is one minor flaw though: the heroes' incredible ability to survive is not realistic. But it is fiction after all and that is why we read thrillers like this, don't we?
B0000CDL93|5.0|Before I go into the film's speculations on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, I'll first review the film. It is a powerful film that is filled with intriguing characters played by an exceptional cast. The storyline fills the plot out rather nicely, and the courtroom scenes are intense and emotionally-charged.<br /><br />Now to the theories the film presents. The Zapruder film makes it plainly obvious that the shot that killed Kennedy did NOT come from the Book Depository, but from the Grassy Knoll. The questions surrounding the assassination, and the questions about a possible cover-up, are presented quite well in this film. The film also presents a theory that is scary to contemplate, but still feasible: the only successful coup d'etat on American soil. The evidence for the conspiracy theories are presented accurately and faithfully.<br /><br />The only segments I disagree with are the theories about Oswald. I still believe he fired shots from the Depository, and two of the bullets he fired hit Kennedy, but I do believe that he became the scapegoat for the conspiracy plot. Other than this little blunder, the rest of the case is presented real well in the film.<br /><br />The bonus DVD features an exceptional documentary that goes beyond the film to discuss the many theories surrounding their deaths, as well as an interview with Fletcher Prouty. The deleted scenes present little good, and are a weak part of the second disc. But the doc makes up for it.<br /><br />Overall, \\"JFK\\" isn't as good as Oliver Stone's most recent film. the epic \\"Alexander,\\" but it is a solid film that is fascinating in it's own right. Even if you don't believe that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was part of a coup d'etat, you will still come out believing that Oswald didn't act alone!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-
B0006399FS|3.0|War, Boy, Zooropa, Pop, Achtung Baby -- all delectable delights from U2. If the subsequent debacles in the form of \\"All that..\\" and \\"How to dismantle..\\" are any indication, U2 should stick to short-title cuts.<br /><br />If you've heard the pounding sonic boom of \\"Vertigo\\" and have your knickers in knots over the oh-so-hip iPod commercial, boy are you in for a gyp. The album is not half as crunchy as its lead song.<br /><br />Even if the monotony of music grows on you (at slug pace, if you are lucky) this is surely not Bono's lyrical peak. Give \\"A Man and a Woman\\" or \\"Yahweh\\" a peak if you wish to get a flavour of the most mawkish depths this band has fallen.<br /><br />I'd be the first to cheerfully recommend anything by U2 but this one's a tossup if not an outright dud.
B00030590I|4.0|For those accustomed to seeing Jet Li in campy (if entertaining) American movies like Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, Hero may come as a bit of a shock at first.  Directed by Zhang Yimou, who's apparently a pretty big deal in China, Hero is an epic morality tale writ large, filled with outsized emotions and political intrigue that just goes to show you not much has changed in the past 2000 years or so.  On its face, it concerns the king of Qin's campaign to unite the seven states of China, but there's a lot more going on beneath the surface.  What starts out as a story of a humble civil servant doing his duty for his king eventually turns into an operatic tale of vengeance, honor, and conflicting values, with plenty of breaks for the kind of rousing martial-arts action that made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so legendary.<br /><br />The quote that opens the film states that in any war there are heroes on both sides, and indeed Hero more than anything else is an examination of the idea of heroism.  The most important idea to be taken from this movie (in this writer's humble opinion, of course), is that of idealism, more specifically how it serves to motivate people.  Nameless is obviously an example of how people's ideals can evolve over time, as his motivations shift from a narrow desire for revenge to a broader concern for the greater good of his people (whether his actions are the best way to achieve the greater good is debatable, but beside the point).  Similarly, we see how Broken Sword and Snow quarrel over the wisdom of assassinating the Emperor, even though both have noble intentions, or at least think they do.  Even the Emperor himself is a paragon of moral ambiguity, as he relentlessly pursues his goal in spite of his awareness of the cost in human lives (incidentally, if you want to see this subject explored from a decidedly different angle, check out the even better film The Emperor and the Assassin).  In the end, whether explicitly or not, each major character has statement to make (actually, Zhang Ziyi's Moon is somewhat extraneous, but I'm willing to let it slide because she's hot).<br /><br />Of course, this being a Jet Li movie and all, much attention is going to be focused on the fight scenes, and none of them fail to disappoint, whether Li is involved in them or not.  It's movies like this one for which the term \\"poetry in motion\\" was invented.  And if you think there aren't enough swordfights in film these days, you should check this movie out at the earliest possible moment.  Just about every battle here is tense, precisely choreographed and shot, and at times even emotional. While there's plenty (maybe a bit too much) of the expected high-flying, intricate action, the scenery ends up becoming more of a focus since it's just so damn stunning.  As many have noted, each fight scene showcases a predominant color, be it red, green, or white, but what's more important is the attention to detail that Yimou put into filming them.  Everything has some significance, from swirling leaves to falling drops of water to the string music that plays during the early battle between Nameless and Sky.  This is the rare movie that can consistently engage your senses without overloading them.<br /><br />It's not just the combat scenes that provide some major eye candy, though: visually, this whole movie is a stunner.  The cinematography gives some idea of the vastness of the Chinese landscape, with awe-inspiring shots of steppes, deserts, and forests, and the scenes involving massed Chinese armies are among the most foreboding and impressive I've seen anywhere.  The arrow attack on the calligraphy school, in addition to being rather poignant in its own way, is particularly impressive in its use of perspective, with shots that do for arrows what John Woo's direction has done for bullets.  In a similar vein, although it's a minor detail, the scene where Nameless sticks his sword through the middle of an arrow shaft is just about the coolest thing in martial-arts movie history.<br /><br />Since so much has been said on the subject, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in my two cents about the political implications of Hero.  Personally, I find the accusations that this movie is an apology for communism or totalitarianism to be exaggerated if not utterly baseless.  Yes, we all know China is a communist country, and communists do all kinds of naughty things, but this movie hardly goes out of its way to endorse any particular ideology.  It's really more about such themes as unity, sacrifice, and patriotism, which countless filmmakers the world over have explored without mentioning communism.  More to the point, with the exception of the postscript that appears on the screen after the action has already ended, the movie doesn't endorse the actions of Nameless or anyone else; it merely demonstrates that different people have different notions of what constitutes \\"doing the right thing.\\"  While viewers are certainly going to draw their own political messages from this movie, the ideas explored here are far more eternal and universal than any ephemeral debate over systems of governance or the virtues of centralized power.  People need to just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, not start inferring messages that don't exist.is just about the coolest thing in martial-arts movie history.   <br /> <br />Since so much has been said on the subject, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in my two cents about the political implications of Hero.

6305047677|4.0|The three Chaplin comedies collected together for the \\"Best of Chaplin, Volume 3\\" consist of a pair of two-reel comedies that he did during his happy days at Mutual, and what is usually considered to be the first appearance by the beloved character of the Tramp in the third comedy the comedian made for Keystone:<br /><br />\\"The Adventurer\\" (Released October 22, 1917), is the last of the films Chaplin did for Mutual.  Charlie plays a convict who escapes after a lengthy chase scene and end up rescuing not only the lovely Edna Purviance, but also her mother and obnoxious fianc&eacute;. Hailed as a hero, everyone thinks Charlie is a wealthy yachtsman and he gets invited to a dinner party at the Judge's mansion.  There, of course, it is just a question of time before his true identity is revealed and things get out of hand.<br /><br />\\"The Cure\\" (Released April 16, 1917) has Chaplin as a wealthy inebriate who is trying to dry out at a sanitarium where once again the lovely Edna catches his eye. If you have ever seen a clip from this one it is probably Chaplin's comic use of the revolving door and the poor guy with the gouty foot. The big joke in this one is that the supply of booze Charlie has brought in a trunk to survive the experience of sobering up ends up being dumped into the mineral spring, which makes for a lot of happy people in the end of this one.<br /><br />3. \\"Mabel's Strange Predicament\\" (Released February 9, 1914) bring Chaplin and Mable Normand together for the first time. They would make nine one-reelers together, including the ambitious six-reeler \\"Tillie's Punctured Romance,\\" and most of them, like this one, were more Mable Normand comedies than Charlie Chaplin comedies.  Chaplin plays a drunken masher for the first time on screen, who tries to get acquainted with the elegantly dressed Mabel, who has to deal with her husband (Chester Conklin), another admirer (Harry McCoy), and his jealous wife (Alice Davenport). The interesting thing here is how Chaplin, the relative novice, steals the movie from the star, Norman, although she really has nothing special to do in this one so it was not a fair fight.<br /><br />None of these three comedies are a true Chaplin classic, although the first appearance of the Tramp (according to most critics; Chaplin had a slightly different view), has some historic importance.  At the very least viewers can have an appreciation for how much Chaplin had grown as a film comedian in a couple of years by comparing his early work at Keystone with the more polished Mutual productions.in, the relative novice, steals the movie from the star, Norman, although she really has nothing special to do in this one so it was not a fair fight.  <br /> <br />None of these three comedies are a true Chaplin classic, although the first appearance of the Tramp (according to most critics; Chaplin had a slightly different view), has some historic importance.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Well, this movie had mixed reception, obviously, but personally I felt it blew the first two out of the water. It captured the feeling of the story in a way that the others failed miserably.  Columbus' films were cheesy, childish, and just not interesting, they lost the depth of the books. This film captured it. <br />There were flaws, the opening scene with Harry using Lumos made me want to break things, but overall excellant, funny, a great adaptation of the books.
B0002UOK04|5.0|This outstanding debut was born from Jari, guitarist/vocalist of Ensiferum leaving the band, for reasons I'm not too sure about. Being that he was the head of the band, this CD sounds much like Ensiferum. This CD is simply amazing. A thrashy folk masterpeice, dotted with classical interludes, and astonishing Yngwie Malmsteen style guitar sweeps and solos. <br /> <br />I was going to break this review down, song by song ... but, in all honesty, there is no point - the CD is as near perfect as I could possible hope for. I will note on a few highlights. <br /> <br />The first two songs are fast, powerful and melodic as Hell ... the third song slows down a bit, and touches more on the instrumental elements. The fourth song is extremely catchy, showcasing Jari's ability to write a masterful song, and also some incredible guitar skills. The fifth song is another more emotional and soft song ... very colourful and deep. Sixth song, nothing to comment on, just another perfect song. Track 7 is a little more gritty, and less melodic than you'd expect. With a death metal feel at time, very dark, brilliant. Some awesome drumming on display here as well, and some surprising technicallity. This is actually something I've found spread throughout the whole CD ... the eighth and final track is the only song I'd have to say I wouldn't give a perfect 10, just because it drags out a little too long, and I found it sort of lossing my attention at two parts ... but besides that, this CD is flawless. <br /> <br />Any fan of folk metal, this is an absolute must buy. Any fan of melodic metal, this is a must buy. Any fan of metal at all, should at least check it out.

B00064MW6A|4.0|Halle Berry is the pick of the Catwoman litter as Patience Philips, a regular girl who finds herself in the center of a dangerous plot that puts her life in deadly peril. Fortunately, she's got nine lives and friends in feline places. Clad in leather and cracking a whip, Patience/Catwoman embarks on a game of cat and mouse with the baddies who murdered her. At her side is Midnight, a canny cat who guides her in the ways of revenge and redemption kitty-style.  <br /> <br />Right from the opening frame, we know we're in for cinematic catnip with the best feline-themed opening credit sequence since Walk on the Wild Side (1962). Filling us in on the back story of the legend and reality of catwomen, we see how cats were revered in Ancient Egypt and how a special, mystical breed called the Egyptian Mau crossed oceans of time to continue to guide certain women of destiny to this very day. <br /> <br />Patience is one of those catwomen, but when first we meet her she is all human. She's overworked and under-appreciated toiling as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a colossal cosmetics company on the verge of releasing an avant-garde anti-aging product. When Patience happens upon the dark secret her employer is keeping from an unsuspecting public, she finds herself knowing too much to be allowed to live. In a mystical twist of feline fate, she is killed but then transformed into a supernatural, catlike creature with a strong sense of justice and a craving for tuna. Patience by day and Catwoman by night, she starts to unravel the mystery of her death (that is, when she's not unraveling balls of yarn). <br /> <br />When it comes to the fine-line catwalk of feline and woman, Berry is pitch-purrfect. She doesn't scratch fleas or lick herself in inappropriate places like Puss in Boots, but she does do a stellar simulation when it suits the character(particularly when she discovers catnip; when she's just waking up; and when she falls from a high place). When she's not out catting around, Patience is a regular girl (make that a regular, incredibly beautiful girl) trying to juggle her social life with her supernatural life. <br /> <br />Catwoman is certainly Berry's show, but her co-stars all keep up more than admirably. Benjamin Bratt plays Tom Lone, a cop who has fallen for Patience but is also on the hunt for the mysterious Catwoman. He's got an easy, likeable charm and is a good match for Berry. Wilson Lambert and Sharon Stone play Patience's evil bosses at the cosmetics company and they both undulate with delicious, comic-book villainy. Another standout is Alex Borstein as Patience's coworker and best friend, Sally. Frances Conroy has a small but important role as Ophelia a woman who shelters the sacred felines. <br /> <br />Catwoman is the comics cream of the crop because this is one of the few superhero films that showcases a female lead with such texture. Sure -- she's a sexy, self-assured kitten with a whip but she's also an interesting, entertaining character that we're more than happy to spend a couple of hours with. It's also a terrific movie for cat-lovers. <br /> <br />There are some clever, insider cat jokes (for instance, the way Catwoman orders a White Russian at a bar) but not as many as you might hope for. The filmmakers definitely missed some marks, especially with the music. In fact, the musical score is my only somewhat complaint. The music in the action sequences was good, but aside from that there is way too much ditzy pop vocalizing going on which will definitely give the movie a stale, dated sound as the years go on.  <br /> <br />The lighting, sets, costumes, etc., are all super stylish and just slightly heightened for a comic book world look and feel without going over the top. The director, Pitof, has a strong background in visual effects and it shows here very nicely. With Catwoman, his first American feature, he also proves he has the pacing and timing for an action film well in hand. <br /> <br />Catwoman isone of the rare summer popcorn flicks that is not oozing in testosterone and uzis. If you want to see a fun film that's empowering for women don't, er, paws... Pounce on a ticket now!
B000069CWE|4.0|Reamination implies remixes, and that is precisely what this CD offers.  The majority of tracks appear on 2000's Hybrid Theory, a fairly standard issue rap-rock cd.  However, the remixed songs and new songs made for the album blow away anythuing done on the debut.  Linkin Park put their songs in the capable hands of the best of the business, throwing in electronic and hip-hop elements for a much more balanced sound.  The beats are heavier, the sound more dense, and guitars and bass lines actually harder.  Each song is expertly mixed, employing the most potent riffs and vocals from the originals in much more concentrated form.  Mike Shinoda's voice compliments talented rappers like Black Thought, Pharoe Monch, Aceyalone, and Chali2na.  Likewise, Chester Bennington gets help from Jonathan Davis and others in the hard rock industry.  Furthermore, the lyrics vary from the original versions which allows them to escape from the usual pitfalls of the rap-rock genre: angst filled post relationship rants and self hate.  The soft track My December throws off the furious and intense pace of the track, with a throughly enjoyable laid back and reflective track.  The final two tracks both clock in at well over 5 minutes and include breath taking intros and fantastic instrumentation.  Krwlng especially has a meloncholy, yet majestic feel and epic quality that perfectly sums up the album.  Overall an excellent album that has very few flaws, and ia much more enjoyable than the straight ahead rock rap debut.  In fact, if you are not a fan of the rap-rock genre but want to give Linkin Park a chance, this is the best place to start.
B00012FXB8|4.0|If you enjoyed the previous two (Alien/Aliens) you should really like Alien 3 : the monster is back, looking just as \\"beautiful\\" and scary, the plot here works just as good as in Aliens (if not better) - and the acting is the best since the first Alien (compared to Aliens and Ressurrection). <br /> <br />So what's the problem? <br /> <br />The action in Alien 3 (the prisoners trying to catch it without getting killed - and the hunters are suddenly hunted, well...) ... at times I realized I was holding my breath, and I sat tightened to the screen, I loved it! <br /> <br />The conclusion: <br /> <br />Alien - five stars (a classic, and undeniable the best of the four) <br /> <br />Aliens - four stars (a bit overrated, but very entertaining - and the monsters are many) <br /> <br />Alien 3 - four stars (the best since the first, and makes it the second best of the four) <br /> <br />Alien Res. - three stars (it should have ended here, and in my opininon it does - the monsters look good though)
B0002F6BRE|1.0|I'm not sure why so many others liked this film, but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The story is too sappy and not funny at all.  I was very disappointed with this after enjoying Will Ferrell's performance in \\"Old School\\".  Sadly, the success of this movie will spawn a sequel for sure, but I will not get suckered again.  If you're looking for holiday laughs and entertainment, then look elsewhere.  This movie is a turd.
0783226845|5.0|This film is a classic, it totally defines modern filming, it is what a film should be like, well made, tender and very precise, it should incorporate explosive or tense scenes with sadness and elegeance, it should put the shy in with the confident to bring out the best in a guy, it should involve Al Pacino in which he single handedly destroys any other actor on screen by his unque crisp talents. Scent of a Woman does this, it is a masterpiece. <br />  <br /> Al Pacino is brilliant as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a retired, arrogant, blind army veteran with a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he is teamed up with Charlie Simms, a young shy college student with a lot to learn. During the thanksgiving holiday he decides to take up the job of taking care of the colonel whilst juggling with his school life problems and the fact that he has been unwillingly taken to New York City for a grand tour by the insistent Colonel. In New York, Charlie (played by Chris O' Donnell) finds out that Frank is planning on indulging in many luxuries before killing himself, Charlie decides to go along although his anxiety shows, he clearly wants to get the Colonel back to Massachussetts safe and sound, but does not seem to have the guts to stand up to the assertive man, bearing in mind he is in deep trouble with the college, and must decide on whether to snitch on some of his buddies for pulling a big prank on the headmaster, this problem could mean him being booted out, and if he conforms he is promised ( by the headmaster) to be boosted into Harvard, he is in a dilemma, the tension is conveyed well throughout the film by Chris O' Donnell and I think that was his best attribute to the film. He still doesn't come close to out-performing Pacino who deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar at the 1992 awards. The ending is even more tense, after avertting a potential suicide bid, Charlie and the Colonel head back to the Baird College for an assembly to see who takes the fall for the prank, with Charlie and his rich buddy (played brilliantly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, you are made to hate him, he reinforces this feeling constantly, he does act very well) and it ends with the Colone and a magnificent speech that is loud but heartfelt and I love it. <br /> <br /> If you like ferraris, fantastic restaurants, sexual material, a bit on the guns, fantastic stories about soldiers juggling grenades, a fantasticly directed set by Martin Brest and Al Pacino in top form then you'll love this film, and everybody should.
1559408855|3.0|This is a very hard to watch movie and is one of my favorites of all time.     I have to say that I disagree with Brian's review about \\"Salo\\" because he said that pasolini creates the situations in the movie, and, that's not true, pasolini takes that situations from sade rather than \\"create\\" the situations, is Sade who takes those twisted characters from france's politics at his era.    I give this movie 3/5 stars because is a very disturbing movie very good but very disturbing.
B00030590I|5.0|While it is true that Mr. Tarantino had absolutely nothing to do with actual production of this film, his stamping his name on it (QT Presents) is not an attempt on his part to take credit for something he didn't do.  On the contrary, its an endorsement on the part of Mr. Tarantino, and I'm sure the filmakers considered it a welcome one when they received their royalty checks.  Lets face it, despite the fact that much progress has been made in recent years towards making Americans more open to foreign films, they still have very limited box office potential in the United States.  Most Americans won't even consider seeing a movie if its subtitled.  Putting QTs name above the title guarantees a built in box office that would not have been there otherwise.  And the ploy worked brilliantly.  \\"Hero\\" opened at #1 at the box office and stayed in the top ten for several weeks after that. If the movie had not been good, having QTs name on it would not have made a difference after word of mouth got out.  But if QTs name had not been there at all, it would likely have opened in a few art-house cinemas and faded to video soon after.  Hats off to QT for turning on a new generation of fans to the pleasures of Hong Kong cinema. <br /> <br />\\"Hero\\" is a brilliant piece of filmaking.  The cinematography is stunning.  The story is engaging.  I loved the performaces.  In my opinion, its the best work that Jet Li has ever done.
B00012FXAE|4.0|Alien number one is no1, and that's my opinion because of the much better actors (and probably director too). I have no idea why alien-fans consider the second movie the best of the four (Alien vs Predator should not be added to these, Ressurrection is at least watchable, and based on the three previous with its' characters and story). <br /> <br />The annoying thing about Aliens, as mentioned, is the ridicolous overacting - and you can't wait to see those stupid army boys (that machinegun-girl included) be slaughtered by the monster(s). Alien (1) feautered great actors, and the movie is far more mysterious - and \\"glows\\" in its' paranoid darkness. The one monster that could be anywhere - and the fact that you don't see it so much (the way you see THEM so many times in Aliens) makes the movie even more scary (and ironically it is a much, much more \\"effective\\" effect (and a lot easier to \\"create\\" I guess). <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong, the movie is good - a little overrated perhaps. And I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this version included previous unreleased material is for the hardcore-fans, yes - watch the original instead - and of course : are you a fan? Don't miss this one.
0064407667|5.0|This book is a good Beggining book!It really makes you want to read all of the other books in the series!
077106506X|5.0|Our book club recently picked this collection of short stories along with two others of the same ilk--a rare thing for us to do.  While we thoroughly enjoyed David Eggers &quot;How We Are Hungry&quot; and Jackson McCrae's &quot;The Children's Corner,&quot; we found Munro's collection to be the best thing we've come across in months.  The sheer amount of territory covered in these sometimes no-so-short stories is remarkable and Munro's writing style should win over even the most irritable critic of this genre.  Don't pass this collection by.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's deepest, darkest and most innovative album, Ray of Light stands out as the turning point in Madonna's career.  When the album hit stores in 1998, after the birth of her daughter and a four-year absence from the music scene (except for the mild success of featured tracks from Evita), it was obvious Madonna had been changed in a profound way.  The song Bedtime Stories included on the like-titled 1994 album gave listeners a hint of what was to come with Ray of Light: electronic dance music filled with lush backing tracks and syncopated rhythms.    Ray of Light is arguably the foundation album for the pop/electronic/dance genre of music that hit the radio mainstream.  With a string of huge hits including the title track, Frozen, and The Power of Good-bye (which was featured on the WB show Felicity), Ray of Light is an album unlike any of Madonna's previous works, and is a must-have for all of her fans, young and old.  However, if you crave bubbly tracks like Cherish and Like A Virgin, beware: you won't find any here.  This collection of songs is far more mature than any of Madonna's earlier work.      As beautiful as it is emotional, the opening number Drowned World/Substitute For Love is one of Madonna's more personal songs in which she touches on the similarities of fame and love.  Vocally, Madonna sounds superb in this song.  Her growth as a singer and a songwriter is obvious almost immediately when listening to this track.  Her voice, with no hint of rasp, is mellow and haunting.  The chords throughout the song are divine. (6/5)    The second track, Swim, is an inspiring tune that will have you tapping your foot and bobbing your head.  Though it's not as moving as the previous number, Swim is just as memorable with its catchy guitars and underwater echoes.  A steady beat carries throughout the tune without much variation; the song feels like a lazy day lounging tune.  As with Drowned World, there's a spooky quality to this song that I can't describe. (5/5)The dance anthem of the summer of 1998, Ray of Light pounds in as the third track.  The delicate balance of building chords, harsh drum beats, spiraling trance bleeps and electric guitars is mastered in this song.  Madonna sings with a louder and brighter tone, ultimately balancing the strange but fantastic arrangement of instruments.  One of Madonna's most memorable songs, this track alone makes the album worth having.  More than six years after its original release, this is still one of my all-time favorite songs by any artist. (6/5)    The fourth track will remind older fans of some of Madonna's previous work.  Titled Candy Perfume Girl, this is predominantly a drumbeat and percussion tune, with various electronic sparkles and electric guitar included.  The bridge portion of the song sounds like a lullaby segment or a music box; it's a wonderful change of style, if for only four measures.  Then the harsh beats and loud guitars hit suddenly, and we're back in the spacey trance of a fun and sexy song. (4/5)    Skin, the fifth track, took some time to grow on me.  In the end, it's a very repetitive and often confusing song; it sounds as if there's no organization to it.  However, it's got many great chords and the lyrics are thought provoking.  A busy tune with samples of hand drum loops, chimes, bells and many overlapping drum kits; the song has a hint of Middle Eastern flavor.  I saw a segment on Entertainment Tonight shortly before the release of Ray of Light, in which Madonna was in the studio recording vocals for Skin, and I was blown away by the emotion she portrayed.  Listening to the song, her conviction is every bit as impressive as it was watching her. (4/5)    With a touch of jazz and a danceable beat, the sixth track Nothing Really Matters is an amazing arrangement.  The piano solo in the bridge portion of the song is fantastic.  Vocally Madonna sounds fragile and innocent; a switch from her often-aggressive nature.  This song was released as a single, which included some great remixes. (5/5)      The sleeper hit of the album, Sky Fits Heaven is the seventh track.  The lyrics are a little fuzzy and the music is very syncopated and strange, but regardless; this song is one of the best on the album.  The music is fabulous with trance echoes, spooky oo's and ahh's, a tender and sparkling piano arrangement and the now familiar house beats.  This song is wonderfully produced and mixed, and is great for a long drive. (6/5)      The enchanting and progressive song Shanti/Ashtangi is the eighth track.  More of a chant and a declaration, this song is simple but polished.  It's a spiritual tune sung in another language, stressing the importance of peace and balance in life.  A big change from anything Madonna has tried in the past (including previous tracks on this album), it takes some time to enjoy this song.  It's repetitive and very raw of instruments, but the beat is infectious. (4/5)      The most soulful and intriguing song on the album, Frozen seduces as the ninth track.  This may be the most beautiful and warm ballad Madonna has ever produced.  Classical strings are the featured instrument in this song, accompanied by light drums and soft trance echoes.  Madonna's vocals are smooth and tender as she sings in desperation.  The string arrangement is timeless, with its slides and volume variations.  I am reminded of This Used To Be My Playground when I hear Frozen. (6/5)      The tenth track The Power of Good-bye sounds as if it could be a sequel to Frozen.  There's an honest quality in this song that is very charming and likable.  The chimes and trance pulses are soothing as Madonna sings with bitter emotion.  Strings are once again an obvious instrument; in particular, the bridge is memorable.  Acoustic guitars add to the honesty and sensitivity of this song. (5/5)    Relaxing and stylish, the eleventh track To Have and Not To Hold is a sad song.  It's very quiet, mellow and altogether gorgeous.  At first listen,there's nothing special about this track.  But after several listens, the romance in this song becomes obvious.  It's not a love song however, but the style both musically and vocally make this tune easy to dance to; you almost want to light candles.  With a bossa nova feel and airy vocals, you'll be enchanted. (4/5)    A very cute and sparkly tune, Little Star is the twelfth track, and one of my favorites.  A song for her daughter, Madonna puts a new twist in the typical lullaby.  Though the usual soothing sounds of trance pulses, echoes and electric pianos are included, jazzy drumbeats and a lazy bass add flavor.  One of the best musical moments of the album is the bridge of this song; Madonna's vocals aren't the most impressive, but the light string arrangement is heavenly: very simple, but very well done and beautiful. (6/5)    The last track, Mer Girl is an interesting tune.  With no percussion or drums, it's Madonna's riskiest move yet.  Stripped bare of instruments, the primary feature on this track is simply Madonna's voice.  She sings of the memories of her mother, and the insecurities she has.  I adore this song; it's a gutsy move for her and I find it full of creativity and the lyrics are heartfelt. (5/5)      This album in it's entirety is very well done, and full of passion and life.  Overseas, Ray of Light had a bonus track titled Has To Be, which was also included on the Ray of Light single as a non-album track.  This song is very moving and if you can find a single or album with it, I suggest purchasing it.  It's a cross between The Power of Good-bye and Mer Girl: very hopeful, optimistic and simply gorgeous.      Unfortunately, Madonna moved on stylistically (once again) with her album Music released in the year 2000.  I would have loved to see Madonna stick with the electronica movement a while longer; it was some of her best work ever.  But like any other Madonna moment, it was fabulous while it lasted and will (in my opinion) live on forever asher wisest and most impressive move.  I highly recommend this album, in addition to every remix single spawned from it.
B000005ILF|4.0|The album is something between The Soul Cages and Ten Summoners' Tales, but not as complete - and not quite as interesting and touching. But it is good, and \\"very Sting\\" if you know what I mean, this is \\"the man\\" performing music in his own special sound and style. If you're not a big fan, but you likes Ten Summoners' Tale, then I guess you should like a couple (or more) of songs from Mercury Falling.     The lyrics (that in my opininon is half the song) are extremely well written (perhaps bad choise of words here) - what I mean here is that Sting as a storyteller, as a poet, and as a \\"messager\\" delievers songs that depends just as much on the lyrics as on the music - yes, without doubt - Sting is deep. A genious of words, and he knows ,somehow, how to use them to get the attention of the listeners - at least he does with me. Sting-lyrics can be funny, unserious, silly, beautiful, gripping, political, sad, melancholic (and so on and on...), but always written in a certain style, and being interested in poetry as I am - Sting works at a high level.    Mercury Falling contains wonderful music, and the first time I heard it I especially enjoyed The hounds of winter and I hung my head (+ the hit from the album, Let your soul be your pilot -a great song that's \\"forgotten\\" on his live-shows it seems should have feautered on All this time, the live-cd/dvd from 2001) - the country songs of Sting, well - I could manage myself without, but they're ok at least.    But, as mentioned, it is the lyrics on Mercury Falling that saves the 96-release - in my opinion. And it sounds that Sting went a new way after this album. Ironically the next release Brand New Day (99) contained the oposite \\"lack\\" (if I dare) - here the lyrics were rather weak (to my eyes and ears), and the music dominated the album.     But being the Sting-fan that I am, Mercury Falling is far from a disappointment - and I find i as a release that has given me much musical-pleasure - and I remember back in 96/97 that I listened to it very, very often - and that it was among my musical-favorites at the time.    4 well earned Stars!     (Best songs on the album -in my opinion of course - are: Twenty five to midnight, a very \\"upbeat-feelgood\\" song if you get my meaning, and though the theme of the songs are very unsimilar it somehow gives me the same vibes as does the fantastic All this time on The soul cages-album. All this time, by the way, is one of my all-time favorite Sting-songs.    Valparaiso, a simple and haunting melody that suits the lyrics so well. Listen to it, close your eyes -and you'll be in the middle of the ocean. The bagpipes as always bring out something melancholic in the listener, in me at least, and the sound of the song is full of longing, and passion. It is feautered on the movie called White Squall starring Jeff Bridges.    Let you soul be your pilot. The hit of the album, but today it seems to be nearly forgotten. A very beautiful song though, and I missed it on All this time (Stings' 2001 \\"best of\\"-live from Tuscany). I love the lyrics.    I hung my head, here the music very sudden became a bit old, the lyrics are a bit similar to Ten summoners' tales' Love is stronger than justice: ironic and funny, and at the same time a \\"bit\\" tragic, the fate of this unlucky cowboy whos constantly hanging with his head in his misfortune. Good song, could have been the other hit from the album, but it wasn't.    I was brought to my sences, a beautiful lyrical piece. And it calls you out for a walk in the forest on a bright autumn day as I believe on of the previous reviewers here described it. Perhaps a little long, I usually listen to the edited single-version from my collection instead. Again, the lyrics here works as half the song -a well-defiened lovesong.    You still touch me, but not quite -it's better live, and suits to be a little rougher than is the album-version. And the music is a bit unoriginal. The best version of it is feautered on the live-single Liveat tfi friday.    Lithium sunset, when you know the background for the lyrics it gets even better. Something like \\"watching the sunset wont hurt your eyes, but will fill them with lithium -and fill you with happiness\\", a friend of mine had read somewhere that a medecine-man had told this to Sting during one his journey to the Amazon -don't know if it's true, but in that case the song makes sence.     All four seasons, but again (again!) because of Stings' humourous lyrics about \\"his\\" womans' various moods. Music adapted by the \\"outtro\\" on When we dance. It works rather good, but it is far from the best I've heard.    The hounds of winter, the song is building up from the start -and works as a worthy opening on a (then) new Sting-album, though perhaps no classic like If I ever lose my faith on Ten summoners' tales...)
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I ordered the Greatest Hits because I love the new song \\"Party For Two\\", then I listened to the other tracks and all I have to say is WOW!!!  This is an album that you can listen to without skipping a song.  Upbeat, slow, or mid tempo songs.....it is in this cd, and to top it off they all have different sounds.  No wonder Shania is one of the top selling female artists, this album tells it all, I can't wait to get her next cd!!
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|These guys combine the mediocrity and fashion sense of metalcore with the pretentiousness and idiocy of punk rock.  The songs are all over the place.  Also, M. Shadows claims that the band is heavily influenced by old school metal like Pantera, Metallica and Guns n Roses.  If you ask me they sound like were influenced by the lastest trendy metalcore band that came out last week. These guys are like the little brothers of Bleeding Through (another worthless band). <br />THEY PLAYED THE WARPED TOUR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
B000148KK2|2.0|Diana has been consistent with each album until her latest. Don't understand why she has bothered to select these songs but I guess her knight in shining armor might have affected her judgment. No doubt this will be a phase and she will return to the likes of \\"Cry me a river\\", \\"Besame mucho\\" and many other good songs. <br />Still, I will cherish her elegance and tastefulness.
B000002KDX|1.0|Though America may draw you in with instantly accessable pop/folk don't be fooled, this is just a sad imitation of Neil Young.  When America was ripping him off Neil was making some of the best rock music ever, try American Stars N' Bars or On The Beach for much better and more original music from NEIL HIMSELF and not imposters.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|When I heard \\"Me Against The Music\\" for the first time, I totally hated it and I thought I was starting dislike Britney's music, but then right before the album was released, I listened some songs in the internet and I realized that the only song I didn't like was Me Against The Music! I was kind of surprised, because I didn't like her third album very much, but then I gought this cd and I loved it. If it weren't for Me Against The Music, I would have given it 5 stars (I also don't like the remix; it's a waste of time to listen to it. It's the same thing that the regular version, but it has other instruments and it's extended in the end.). I hardly recommend you to buy this cd, and when you do it, listen Breathe On Me, because it's a really super-cool song. I don't know why it wasn't a single; Britney said that because it was a sexual song. It's not about sex, it's just about...breathe! Don't let them influence you, except for Touch Of My Hand; now, that's really a sex song, but...so? Janet Jackson is an amazing and talented and super famous singer and she has lots of sexual songs!<br />In The Zone is a really cool album; the best in her career, I would say.
0140288503|4.0|Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden might be one of the best war stories I have ever read. Iv'e always enjoyed reading novels about past wars but this book was so shockingly descriptive that it gave me chills. Bowden along with soldiers who fought in Somalia take you step by step from the invasion to the miraculous rescue with stories about the brave marines who were fighting. I had seen the movie that was made from this book and I thought that the movie was awesome but once I started to read this book I liked it more than the movie because I could create my own picture of what it was like even though the movie helped me to create a more realistic setting in my mind. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading detailed war stories. However if you dont like bloody war books this is not the book for you. I would give this book 4 starts because I loved reading it and it was very well put together.
B000002L9J|5.0|\\"The Queen is Dead\\" represents The Smiths at their absolute zenith.  After the promise of their impressive, but flawed debut album and the botched \\"Meat is Murder\\" (save the stunning \\"How Soon Is Now\\" which single handily rescues that album) \\"The Queen is Dead\\" delivered, and then some, the album the band had only been hinting at. <br /> <br />Filled with shimmeringly melodic pop songs that are both droll and tragic (sometimes all at the same time) the album is a tour de force of the 80's alternative scene even if it, incredibly enough, did not yield any hit single sin the US.  \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly,\\" \\"Cemetery Gates,\\" \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" (now Morrissey knows how Joan of Arc felt, uh-hu), \\"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side,\\" \\"Vicar in a Tutu,\\" and \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\" -- these aren't songs one argues with and I haven even gotten to \\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" which just may rank as the 80's alternative rock scene's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (other contenders for that title including, but not limited to \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" by New Order, \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" by Joy Division and R.E.M.'s \\"Radio Free Europe\\"). <br /> <br />In short this one is indispensable, <br /> <br />5 stars.
B000001IQH|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the best Rancid album ever made. Every song is catchy, fun to listen to, has great bass and are short and to the point. The album opens up with the virtuoso bass, fast punk song, Maxwell Murder. After it goes into 11th Hour and others that are great to listen to. Then it gets to Ruby Soho, one of the catchiest songs on the album and a big single from the album. After Ruby Soho, the rest of the album is good to listen to. Not a single \\"bad, skip this\\" song. All songs are ska-based and have catchy choruses, which surprises me because I didn't think Tim and the crew would write 19 awesome songs on one cd. Well, they did. If you don't have this album for some reason, get it. Buy it, burn it, something. JUST GET IT!! Also, if you like Operation Ivy, you are most likely going to love this.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Wow, I can't believe there have been 5 star ratings for Britney on here.  Now, I'm not going to 'bash' her but explain a few truths to the last comment that Britney is 'still as successful' as she was when her 1st, 2nd or 3rd album came out. Britney is doing very, very bad, boys and girls. But she doesn't want you to know.    Has someone forgot the horrible single 'Me Against the Music'? It didn't even chart the US billboard. And the reason? It's horrible crap.  Has someone listened to the new single on her \\"Greatest Hits\\"? The single \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" sounds exactly like No Doubt's \\"Hella Good\\" but with more whistles and bells to camouflage the fact that is as unoriginal and boring as Britney.  \\"Hella Good\\" was an awesome song but a few years ago, and when it was `original'. And the two `new' songs on \\"My Prerogative\\" are also unoriginal and horrible as Britney in a new tight halter top.    As far as sales go, \\"In The Zone\\" is a failure. 3 million copies is horrible! Sarah McLaughan from my hometown of Vancouver has sold more than 3 million copies of her new album in less time and without as much press as Britney. Sarah only has a market in North America; whereas, Britney has the world at her over painted nails (fingertips). When Britney has a 'tv premiere' to promote her new album, just like Michael Jackson did a long time, you have to wonder how bad the album is. And Britney's albums are progressively getting worse like mold growing on cheese.     Now, fine Britney had a few #1's in the UK but I hate to say, British like horrible pop music. Westlife anyone? Boyzone? S Club 7 or Juniors? (Ok, I'm getting ill).    Now, Britney is good drinking music (meaning you have be very drunk to enjoy it) and I respect Britney for releasing (with big-name producers' and writers' help) previous `fun time' music. But as I realized many years ago, her sound hasn't changed one bit. Once a pop tart, always a pop tart.      Really, Britney, you're a [...]. Yes, I lied about not bashing her. Go have your baby, and get someone to re-invent your image and music because it is very tiresome. But if you do, come out with anything 'decent', I will be a happy boy.    LOVE DAN
B0001I562I|5.0|When I spotted this on the sales rack, my jaw dropped. Though in hindsight it may sound just plain silly, for some reason it just never occurred to me that this movie would ever be available for sale in any format. I absolutely loved this movie when I first saw it on television, and then never saw it again, but never forgot it. Some scenes from the movie were so memorable they have played in my mind many times in the years since. I loved the wisecracking and playful, endearing alien robot. For some reason the scene where they're travelling back through time, that particular scene's really stuck in my mind over the years. I immediately ordered it from Amazon.com, and am absolutely delighted to have it now in my collection. This is the kind of movie that can be watched again and again.
B000669GAI|5.0|On this doubble CD you will find some songs that you can listen to over and over and over again for decades without loosing interest. Although I miss 'Release' and 'indifference', you do find their best songs here. 95% of the tracks here are phenominal and deserves your attention. If you are a pearl jam hater I see no reason for people to review their albums here. It obvious that 'Scissor Sisters Fan' doesn't have much to do and needs to turn his or her anger towards bands he or she dislikes. Get a life! (and wash your ears) <br /> <br />I highly recommend this cd because it contains pearl jam's best work, and I doubt they will compose anything better in the future. They have their best years behind them and those years are well represented on this rockin doubble album.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I've read many many reviews of this album, on this site and others, and it seems the only negative thing people can say about Muse is that they remind people of Radiohead.  Amazon's critic (he sounds like he's probably a BIG fan of Good Charlotte and/or Creed) seems to think that their similarities to that band makes them unoriginal.  If being an exceedingly creative, expressive, intelligent, technically virtuosic band that can go from mosh-inducing speed metal to beautifully haunting piano passages in a single song, and play every style like they specialize in it, makes a band \\"unoriginal\\", then I hope that every band in the future is as unoriginal.  Get this album, and everytime you listen to it, you will find new details in the music.  It's the kind of album in which your favorite song changes from one listen to another.  I'm about to see my first live Muse show in Atlanta on the 5th and I can't wait!!
B000084T18|2.0|I really like Dr. Dre's production on \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"What Up Gangsta\\". It's very widescreen and explosive. Dre really knows how to craft beats around the persona of the artist he is working with; whereas on Em's albums he creates beats that belong in some strange cartoon funk world, here he makes cinematic blockbuster beats, like a gangstered up Jerry Bruckheimer film.  50's lyrics, however, are just lists of cliches.  I remember Guru from Gangstarr rapping that \\"too many rappers wanna be gangstas, too many gangstas wanna be rappers.\\" This is what he was talking about. Give me talent over street cred any day..on top of that, dude looks like some kinda corny pop'n'lock action figure. In a few years he'll be singing duets with J.Lo, just wait...
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Making a Guns 'n Roses \\"Greatest Hits\\" was a good idea. I'm enough of a GNR fan that I need to have all the albums, but for people who aren't, I don't think is the best starting point. <br /> <br />The singles are here, but some keys songs are missing, at the expense of mediocre GNR material like Yesterdays. To be sure, the must-haves are here: Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Sweet Child, Patience, November Rain. But a lot of the should-haves got left out. <br /> <br />Fully 5 of the 14 tracks are covers, and no one ever accused the band of being poor songwriters. The Sympathy For the Devil cover isn't substantially different from the Rolling Stones original, but it's quite good, it was practically written for Axl, and it didn't appear on any of their studio albums. Including it was probably a good call. The other cover songs are good, too, but they're here at the expense of original GNR material. A greatest hits album should feature songs you can't find from other artists, not very decent work from the likes of Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan. <br /> <br />Only one song from \\"Lies\\" is on this compilation, while two from the universally-panned \\"Spaghetti Incident\\" found their way in. Meanwhile, essential GNR tracks like \\"Estranged\\" and \\"You're Crazy\\" (the song so good they put it on two albums) and the infamous \\"Used to Love Her\\" are missing. <br /> <br />The songs included from \\"The Spaghetti Incident?!\\" are actually pretty good (and so is the exactly-like-the-original version of Hair of the Dog), and if this were a two-disc set, I'd say they should be here. But it isn't, and those aren't essential GNR tracks. <br /> <br />This album may be the right choice for the most casual of fans, but if you have any real interest in the band, it leaves out too much. If you can get your hands on Patience and November Rain, you don't really _need_ Lies or UYI 1, but Appetite and UYI 2 are indispensable. <br /> <br />\\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is one of the most acclaimed albums of the last quarter-century. I would say that most fans should start there, because this compilation doesn't do justice to the band's legacy.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Encore un &eacute;ni&egrave;me film de super h&eacute;ros?<br /><br />C'est ce que je me suis dit avant de visionner ce petit chef-d'oeuvre de noirceur et d'humour noir.<br /><br />Le tout commence durant la deuxi&egrave;me guerre mondiale. Les soldats am&eacute;ricains sont envoy&eacute;s en Russie pour enrayer une \\"exp&eacute;rience paranormale\\". C'est ainsi que ce film est lanc&eacute;. On se base sur des faits historiques en les modifiant quelque peu. Ce n'est pas du r&eacute;visionnisme, loin de l&agrave;.<br /><br />Hellboy le diablotin rouge et Abraham l'homme poisson font penser aux X-Men. Ils sont employ&eacute;s pour des missions secr&egrave;tes afin de combattre des ennemis hors du commun.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" fait aussi penser &agrave; Spider-Man car les gens l'ont vu ou croient l'avoir vu. Mais les photos prises de lui sont toujours floues.<br /><br />Le h&eacute;ros n'a rien de ridicule. Ce n'est pas un homard g&eacute;ant d&eacute;pourvu de cervelle et de sentiments. Il va se battre pour le bien et surtout pour être reconnu et accept&eacute;. Du moins, c'est ce &agrave; quoi il aspire. Pour ce faire, il lime ses cornes.<br /><br />Apr&egrave;s \\"Blade II\\", Guillermo Del Toro signe un formidable film fantastique et ce, avec des moyens peu &eacute;lev&eacute;s. On pouvait s'attendre &agrave; des effets peu soign&eacute;s. Il n'en est rien. Ils sont formidables, ainsi que les d&eacute;cors et surtout les acteurs.<br /><br />Ron Perlman donne une nouvelle dimension au h&eacute;ros. Cool, intr&eacute;pide, courageux, franc mais et surtout sensible. Il ne porte pas de costume pour se camoufler, son costume, c'est sa peau.<br /><br />Le film ne contient pas de longueurs. Les combats sont assez vite exp&eacute;di&eacute;s et ne s'&eacute;ternisent pas; ce qui laisse de la place aux dialogues.<br /><br />Ici, il n'y a pas un mais plusieurs ennemis &agrave; affronter. Hellboy s'en charge avec une certaine \\"cool attitude\\".<br /><br />Film&eacute; dans des d&eacute;cors soign&eacute;s, tendance gothique, le film plonge dans le noir, dans les tr&eacute;fonds du mal tout en parvenant &agrave; garder une certaine l&eacute;g&egrave;ret&eacute;, parfois utile &agrave; l'histoire.<br /><br />Ce triple DVD (&eacute;dition am&eacute;ricaine) est tout simplement fabuleux.

0553275976|3.0|Best description of this book is that of bridge between the genre novels and literature. It is not very good literature nor is it as bad (some might say less interesting) as genre novels. The characters and character descriptions are overstated and could very well have been written by anyone after reading 10-15 crime thrillers. The redeeming feature of this book is the work Tom Wolfe put into collecting a lot of information about a particular period in a particular city, varying  from inner-city housing projects, jail cells, attorney's offices and high society life.  <br /> <br />The story is that of a fundamentally decent white male getting caught up in a minor traffic accident and getting exploited by the society around him. A criticism I have is that the characters who donot belong to the traditionally wealthy (means non WASP men according to the author) are portrayed as upstarts resentful of old wealth and wanting to bring them down to their level. For some reason there is not a single character in this book who want to rise up and be equal to the traditionally wealthy by honorable means.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Back in 1995, Nine Inch Nails released The Downward Spiral to the public.  It was a shocking, depressing, disturbing album, revealing in Trent Reznor either a brooding genius steeped in self-loathing, or at least a person who was very good at pretending to be a brooding genius steeped in self-loathing.  The album's closing track, \\"Hurt,\\" was in some ways the most disturbing of all fourteen tracks.  Yet my appreciation for the entire album, at least on some level, was tempered with the knowledge that basically Reznor was a lonely whiner with a really good set of synthesizers.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2002, and the release of this album.  I was vaguely aware of Johnny Cash's cover of \\"Hurt,\\" but hadn't really paid attention to it.  It seemed iconoclastic and strange.  Recently though, I was compelled to try this album out, knowing it boasted a couple interesting covers.  And let me tell you, I now believe that Johnny Cash's rendition of \\"Hurt\\" surpasses the original by a wide margin.  I am a big fan of NIN, and it surprised me as much as anyone to say this, but Reznor's own song is just not even close.  All the industrial noises and eerie sounds have their place, but frankly the song is infinitely more powerful when its lyrics are spoken by a man who has known a lot more hurt, and for a much longer time, than Trent Reznor has.  When Cash covered this song, backed only by an acoustic guitar, it became his.<br /><br />Yet \\"Hurt\\" is not the only song Cash made into his own; just the best.  I'm not much of a Beatles fan, but the way Cash sings \\"In My Life\\" is nothing short of heartwrenching.  It's as if the song were written by Cash himself.  Again, all that accompanies his baritone is an acoustic guitar, and frankly that is all that is necessary.  And again, it is superior to the original, no contest.<br /><br />I am not familiar with Sting's \\"I Hung My Head,\\" but I can't imagine it being better than Cash's rendition.  It reminds me of \\"Don't Take Your Guns to Town,\\" and is probably even more affecting.  I'll never forget the way Cash pours his heart into this song.<br /><br />Not every cover works quite as well as these three.  \\"Personal Jesus,\\" in particular, feels a bit off, especially with the piano accompaniment.<br /><br />As for Cash's own material (\\"The Man Comes Around,\\" \\"Give My Love to Rose,\\" and \\"Tear Stained Letter\\"), these songs work beautifully.  \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is especially memorable, pervaded with images of the end of the world.  Cash in this song seems more like a prophet making a late entry into the New Testament than a country singer.<br /><br />It's hard not to listen to that deep voice of authority, a voice somehow not for this world and somehow better than this world.  It's the voice of a man who has seen everything.  It manages to be both pitifully fragile and powerfully sure of itself.  We lost a great and irreplaceable man in John R. Cash.own,\\" and is probably even more affecting.

B00005YW4H|1.0|I gave this a listen upon hearing how she's a throwback to the days of Billie Holliday and Ella Fitzgerald. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. About the only thing this album is good for is filling up the landfill. It is BORING and safe-as-milk. What a letdown. This is what baby boomers put on the stereo for sex mood music. That's right, chief: pop your blue pill and tell yourself you're the man, but for god sake, find something ELSE besides this bland collection to play. Go with Chet Baker, Nat King Cole, or the aforementioned Holliday and Fitzgerald - you'll have a better soundtrack for lovin', trust me.
B000002WYT|5.0|Crash is on of Dave Matthews Band's best CDs for multiple reasons.  In my opinion, each song on this CD is great.  Unlike many of the bands today, the music never gets repetitive, each piece is unique.   <br />As For the red-neck reviewers who downplay this music because it might be too soft for their Ted Nugent taste, I how there arguments against Crash make sense.  One reviewer said that there is not much musical ability in this band.  This is one of the best bands ever insturmentally, and I am not the only one who believes that.  There are many \\"greatest\\" lists that have place DMB in the top whatever. <br />Secondly, there are many reviewers who don't think these are lyrically good songs.  Many say they are a little confusing or are about nonsense.  This may seem so, or it may be that those people don't have the ability to understand much because of there lack of brain matter.  Also, some of the greatest poets made poems that didn't seem to make much sense.  But if one really looked into them, he would realize what works of art they were.  I am not saying Dave is a great poet, but you get my point. There I am done.
B0004Z33EG|4.0|the fellow before me wrote an amazing review of this \\"Ultimate\\" Edition? ....it has less going for it than the previous edition...by a long shot...BUT , Stallone's commentary is worth it...sadly any hard core fan of the movie will need BOTH editions.  Why can't these folks treat us right?  ...i had a feeling I shouldn't get rid of my current special editions of these movies when I saw the ULTIMATE editions coming out...and thankfully i didn't...the previous editions are SUPERIOR with many wonderful bonus features...these META scope etc etc..SUCK and would annoy a child.....much less an adult.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Nobody really seems to get it re the debut Rainbow album; hence, a lot of reviews tend to find its strengths to be flaws. This is the one where Blackmore basically replaced the guitarist in Elf and took over the songwriting and direction of the band - the more popular lineup, with Cozy and Jimmy Bain, was still a year away. Thus, unlike every other Rainbow album afterwards, RBR is almost a Mexican standoff between Ritchie's gothic guitar pyrotechnics and Elf's chunky, funky Southern rock sound, and while a number of reviewers mystifyingly wish this album would sound more generically 'metal', this peculiar blend of styles is what gives this album its unique and very satisfying flavor. Keyboardist Mickey Lee Soule (who's been Deep Purple's keyboard tech in recent years) essentially blends into the rhythm section of Gruber & Driscoll, but his pallette of funky and soulful sounds (dig that harpsichord work!) add class and color to the songs and help provide Blackmore with maybe his ideal backing band: he is on serious fire throughout this disc, laying down one impeccable, tastefully hellacious solo after another....I can't ever remember him sounding this good on a studio album, before or since. The understated restraint of these musicians is a huge plus, not a minus: when a track works on this record, it works as a song with its own identity as opposed to a faceless back-catalog stuffer (the way so much of the Turner-era material was - \\"Drinking with the Devil\\"...eccchhh). I can't picture \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" or \\"Temple of the King\\" retaining the almost-magical qualities they have, here, had they been recorded with any other musicians than these boys. Even \\"Still I'm Sad\\" is something special, from the guitar-and-cowbell intro to the haunting, distant vocal wails on the fadeout - and, once again, Ritchie is right there with a brilliant and dramatic solo. On tour, it would be trundled out and metalled-up with a typically-overpowering Dio vocal, yet this smaller-scaled instrumental version of the tune is the one that gets into your head and stays there. <br /> <br />Hey, if you want the same old same-old, the shelves are full of it, including other Rainbow albums - knock yourself out. But if you want a hard-rock album with a little idiosyncracy, a little uniqueness all its own, grab this one.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Long overdue, present day DVD technology has made this presentation possible.  That is one of the reasons why it strikes you in realizing just how much the world has changed since 1985. But regardless of all technological progress, world hunger remains. First of all, an event of such scope and relevance would be unthinkable today in this world of media conglomerates, mass-marketing, product-placement, and the constant and never ending genera-subdividing by the music industry. Just getting bands of this caliber together on the same stage wold be a legal and logistical nighmare today. Then look closely, not one single rap artist played Wembley or JFK, not to metion hip-hop, which is now the driving force in music (Run DMC is featured, but only as an extra). It seems the most memorable performance was Queen, and how it stole the show, looking at it, you kind of feel sad when you think that Freddy Mercury's tallent is not with us anymore. Two other standout performances: U2, & The Who. It is understandable that an event this long would take more DVDs to be captured in it's integrity and is not practical, but there are two MAJOR omisssion I spotted. First the historic Led Zeppelin reunion with Phil Collins and the recently deceased Tony Thompson (Chic, Power Station) on drums. This performace was sloppy and terrible, maybe that's why it was left out, but that is the very reason why it was memorable. The other is Santana's performance with then relatively unknown Pat Metheny, a collabotaion of two guitar legends. Many of the bands featured have faded away in time, but after seeing Live Aid again you do come out with a feeeling that times were realy simpler back then, and music was, well just music. Good music.   A must for any music library.    ADDENDUM:  JULY 2005: LIVE 8, SO IT HAS BEEN DONE.  Twenty years later,  once again music made the people come together. THANK BOB GELDOF FOR ANOTHER GREAT DAY IN MUSIC HISTORY.
B00030590I|2.0|The color themes were a good idea and, in and of themselves, implemented well. There were other esoteric themes in the movie such as the the emperor's candles and their manner of giving off vibes by blowing in various directions in unison.<br /><br />At that point the thrill ended for me. The martial arts displays were overly artsy and underly realistic (see Jet Li in 'Kiss of the Dragon' or 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' if you want to see entire caliburs of higher quality MA's work). They were also very redundant - that spinning horizontally in the air deal was done to the point where I wanted to spin my remote control at the screen in a similar fashion.<br /><br />Additionally I thought there was far too much wire work that didn't really go anywhere. It was of a higher quality, in my opinion, than some of the wirework in CTHD but at least in CTHD there was a lot of variety and not the same three or four wire scenes repeated endlessly.<br /><br />I might have scored this higher had the cast been of a lower calibur. It's just innate that we tend to judge the quality of given people against themselves, and actors such as Jet Li took two steps backward against some of their previous work. This I have to blame on direction (regardless of the origin - the directors job is to pump the best of the best from those he/she is working with).<br /><br />Overall my expectations, which were partially based on the trailers, were very high, so this film was a great dissapointment for me. It was also a great frustration as I know the cast has much higher ability and some of the thematic ideas were very clever. It sort of makes you want to write to the producer and ask \\"can we try this again only do it right?\\".<br /><br />As well, the story itself was lacking luster.<br /><br />So - you ask - why give it any stars? I did so because it wasn't a total waste. In addition to the thematic concepts mentioned earlier there were at least a couple of decent sequences. One was the inital arrow rain let loose by the emperors army on the calligraphy school. That was kinda 'special'. As well, the costume designs were admittedly impressive.<br /><br />Good luck and I hope others who have bought the movie find more in it than I.he inital arrow rain let loose by the emperors army on the calligraphy school.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is fantastic, it really shows how these guys that once made sogs like \\"Basket Case\\" and \\"Walking Contradiction\\" can now make songs this serious. This is Green Day's maturity flashing before our eyes and right to our ears in the shape of this rock opera album called \\"American Idiot\\". I never expected to see Green Day involved in political opinions but here they are.  <br />Songs like \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" are a delight to listen to, there you appreciate how much this band has grown, and \\"Whatsername\\" is perhaps the best closer of a Green Day album. <br />This is a great piece that deserves your attention because this is not just another punk album that came around, this is something special that came to be noticed and stay. <br />Thanks for reading.
0064407667|5.0|George Killmer 12/02/04    The Bad Beginning:   Lemony Snicket:   ISBN 0-06-440766-7       Why do bad things always happen to kids?  Violet and her brother and sister, Klaus and Sunny started off by having their parents die on the second page of this book.  They wound up in an orphanage but then they later found out there was a distant relative willing to take them.  When the orphans got to this mans house, it turned out he was a mean, cruel, guy named Count Olaf that only cared about money.  The orphans later found out they were doomed and they would probably rather die then spend another day with this crook.  This is a realistic fiction book and is great for all ages.      This book was awesome.  I was always looking forward to turning the next page everytime.  It was funny and it had me jumping off my seat at every chapter.  Kids from the ages 9-20 would probably enjoy this book best because of the dialog.  If you like building or inventing things, you would also enjoy this book.  Inventor, Violet Baudelarie, was the main character in the book and she could invent anything on the top of her mind. Whenever she would invent something, she would twirl her hair into a ponytail and that meant she was in thinking mode.  If you enjoy reading you would probably like Claus.  He has read almost every book in America.  He is a smart boy just looking for a way around Count Olaf.  Now if you are a baby reading this book, you would enjoy reading about Sunny and her wacky way of talking. She would make up words that probably mean something in real english.  She is just a toddler that looks up to her brother and sister.  She has amazingly sharp teeth so watch out.  While I was reading this book, I was so surprised about how Count Olaf wanted to merry Violet.  If you read this book you will know why he wanted to.  I personally enjoyed this genre because there wasn't any flying pigs or floating people.  It is just as real as the real world.  This book was remarkable because of theway the author wrote the book.  He wrote in a fluid style of not going to overboard in each chapter.  He didn't just write two words and then jumped right into a conclusion.  He wrote why it happened and how it happened.  He is just a great author.  This book was the direct adverse of boring.  It always had something coming up and it had some great humor a long the way.  My mind did sometimes wander while I was reading this book.  I always thought of if my parents just died instantly like that.  I know I wouldn't be as brave as they were.  I don't think they even cried once.  This book was great I would read it again.  There are other sequels to this book like The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window, so you should check those ones out too.  This book is the best  book that I have ever read.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Just like Tony Montana, this movie will resist a long time before it can get beaten...if it gets beaten.    A crime masterpiece from start to finish...the story is savage and the characters are awesome.   Tony Montana, Manolo \\"Manny\\" Rivera, Chi Chi and Angel were four cubans that got the chance to experience the american dream.    They didn't all make it. From his beginnings as a cook in a latin food spot to his domain of power built by the drug business, Tony Montana is one amazing character to watch, played perfectly by Al Pacino...he takes no crap from no one and turned himself into a guy so secure of himself to the point of believing he didn't need his friends or wife no more.    Truly, a fascinating story to watch, sprinkled with good dialogue, wild action and sometimes brutal violence (the infamous chain saw scene) this highly entertaining film belongs in any DVD collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Man this CD is so amazing.  <br />Songs 1-7 are simply awesome. <br />8.She's a Rebel (6/10) Nothing special here. <br />9.Extraordinary Girl (7/10) I like the melody, but i usually skip this song. <br />10.Letterbomb (10/10) My favorite on the entire CD. This song is fast with amazing lyrics, man i just love it. <br />11.Wake Me Up When September Ends (5/10) Nah, don't like this one. Waaay too slow and not catchy. <br />12.Homecoming (6/10) This is another 9 minute song. I think one part of it is good but the rest - crap. <br />13.Whatsername (8/10) Slow at first, but gets really good at the very end.  <br />BONUS TRACK: Favorite Son (9/10) I like this song. Very fast and well.... typical Green Day. <br /> <br />Overall this CD is a must have to any Green Day fan or Punk-rock fan. Its kind of hard to get into it the very first time, but giving it more than one try won't disappoint.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|In response to a spotlight reviewer 'Mike'<br /><br />'This is the album that proved all the critics wrong'<br /><br />'All the critics just said that these guys were just people who jumped around on stage screaming useless stuff with no meaning'<br /><br />They have two acoustic songs, one slowish type song and a song that starts off heavy and enters into an acoustic breakdown'<br /><br />Well, I'm impressed. Slow songs eh? 'Acoustic songs' Well, it might help if you ACTUALLY knew the meaning of 'acoustic song'. A slow song IS NOT an 'acoustic song', you said yourself one starts heavy, then it cannot be acoustic. Nirvana Unplugged is acoustic, all songs are played with acoustic instruments.<br /><br />'I honestly couldn't see them playing this album live' [...]<br /><br />Those songs are so creative and crazy, you have no idea.'<br /><br />Enlighten me.<br /><br />Do not trust anyone who goes by the name 'SlipknotMaggot666', they are likely to be 12 years old, with a cupboard full of those gahstly T-shirts.<br /><br />Why do you people feel proud to be called 'maggots'.<br /><br />I read in 'Kerrang' magazine, and I quote from one of the the many masked loosers,<br /><br />'hearing John Lennon's Imagine opened up a whole new world to me'<br /><br />A world involving horrible masks, poor attempts at satanism [...]'maggots'.

B0001AP12G|5.0|When I heard Kanye West in Twista's Slow Jamz I thought he was okay but then I heard Through The Wire this dude's rhyme is crucial. His production are tight.

B00004XOWM|1.0|The fact that Dan Gennoe, the Amazon editorial reviewer, says that Limp Biscuit have give `sterile electronica laced with dark melodies as infectious as anything Britney has to offer' I'm not sure if this is a rather humorous joke, insulting Limp Biscuit, which I would prefer, as apposed to a dribble piece of writing. For non-believers of Fred Durst and his motley crew of loosers, its funny. `Ultimately, though, it's that undeniably intelligent musical backdrop' oh dear, maybe Dan was in fact being useless and writing any old contrived piece of [...] that came into his mind to please the readers, and quite simply do his job. This statement was obviously unplanned, and filled the sentence nicely, to say Limp Biscuit use `intelligent musical backdrops' is a complete utter [...].<br /><br />The supposed `glory days' of Limp Biscuit are long gone, nowadays they have done the seemingly impossible, to go down hill...which, considering they started at the very depths of raucous dribble metal-come-rap, is profoundly outstanding. The wonderful concoction of hip-hop and nu metal is quite original. But, when you consider both of these genres are truly awful you begin to realise Limp Biscuit are indeed one sh*tty band. Mind you, they are intelligent.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|You'll never have a better time being offended in your life.  Somehow Trey and Matt manage to be more disgusting and vulgar than ever and still be hilarious.  The \\"Lease\\" scene had me practically falling out of my chair -- see this movie immediately!!  Can't wait for the DVD!!
B000084T18|1.0|It is unfortunate that this he is the biggest thing in hip hop.  The whole mainstream hip hop scene is lacking tremendously; 50 Cent provides nothing worth listening to.  There is not a single track where 50's lyrical ability warrants any respect.  The beats are simple and weak:  4 to 8 bar loops used throughout the whole track.  The singles from this album were laughable.  50 inconsistently sways from being a sensitive thug on tracks like 21 questions to being a hardcore pimp-type figure in P.I.M.P.  50 is laughable; don't buy this album.
2070518426|5.0|I took French years ago but like many US citizens, I rarely had the opportunity to actually use even what little I knew.  Remembering the old saw that \\"If you don't use it, you lose it,\\" I tried from time to time to improve my reading skills by taking up a book that I knew I had enjoyed in English.  Although still difficult to find, books in French are becoming more common than they used to be and less expensive too.  I found this one with little difficulty on Amazon, and have added other books in the language from the site to my wish list.<br /><br />I was so successful in reading and understanding the simple French of Harry Potter, that I was almost at my normal reading speed.  Although there were sentances and phrases that did not always make sense to me, I found that if I pronounced the French words in my mind rather than trying to translate the material into English, I often understood much better.  I also found that the next time I ran across a new or difficult word that I had found in one context, I recognized its meaning much more quickly in another.  Just as in learning to read English as a young person, I find that reading persistantly is the key to developing a vocabularly.<br /><br />Though I don't ever expect to be a fluent French speaker and will probably never sit down and write my reviews in any language but English, I really, really, really enjoyed having an opportunity to re-read Harry Potter, this time in French.  I recommend the series to parents of children learning to read French and adults who wish to improve their language skills.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The first two movies truly had me enchanted but I had one slight problem with them...The director. His lack of camera work had me driven up the wall by the end of the film. This movie on the other hand was brilliantly shot. Beautiful scenery and many scenes where the camera goes straight through windows *shudders at the beautiful thought*. The script on the other hand was differant...The first two had both the same major plot line and I was definately hoping for something more in this film and I didnt get like many suggested. I was told that it got much more dark. I do not agree. Camera work is everything which is what makes me give the first two a 4 star (would have given it five if they had THIS directore). But this film has so little attachment to the charecters that I almost have no desire to find out what happens next. Only watch it if you have time just so you can catch what goes on between \\"Chamber\\" and \\"Goblet\\"...
B00065JTBA|5.0|B-sides and demos are great because you actually get to hear unpolished work from artists. This box is full of potential top 40 hits from a band that's had more than a few.  Although it's obvious why a few of these songs didn't make the final cut, quite a few definitely should have. The music in this box is amazing and very different from that \\"voice box\\" bon jovi that we hear on the radio. A lot more of a John Mellencamp vibe happening in the music. One disappointment was \\"starting all over again\\".... I heard a different, much better version of this song years ago - the one in this box must have been the very first take. <br /> <br />All in all - I give this collection a full set of stars. If you're NOT a fan - you might be after listening to some of these songs - if you ARE a fan - than you'll be pleased with what really amounts to 4 new bon jovi CDs.   <br />
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is one movie that I keep coming back to again and again.  Yes, I'm a history buff, and the Civil War is fasinating to me.  But, that is not the reason that this movie is so powerful.  What is powerful about it are the powerful examples of leadership.  A couple of examples stand out. At the end of side one, the \\"Battle of Little Round Top\\" is highlighted.  At the end of the approximately 30 minute excerpt, the leader, Colonel Chamberlain is confronted with a problem.  His men have run out of ammunition.  However, if he retreats, since he is on the flank, the Confederates will \\"go over the hill, hit our units from the rear and our whole flank will cave in...\\"  What does he do?  Then, someone exclaims: \\"Here they come again!\\"  So, he says \\"We'll fix bayonets\\".  His subordinate says: \\"What do you mean - charge?\\"  And, Chamberlain takes charge, telling his men that they can do it because \\"the Rebs must be tired... and we have the benefit of going down hill...\\".  Well, they charged and won... Another scene also highlights leadership with a different result.  On the second side, one of the focus is on General Armistead.  When it is clear that Picket's charge has failed, he places his hat on his sword, and tells his men, \\"follow me\\".  To one soldier, who is rightfully scared, he says \\"what will think about yourself in the morning\\".  All this is done, knowing he will fail and with the premonition that he expresses in the previous day that he will die. Examples of personal leadership, examples of personal courage.  These are real stories and stirring every time that I see them.  And, this movie does the best job of communicating these personal stories.  This is truly my favorite movie, and I highly recommend it on many levels.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is about miracles and about love. It is life set to music. Go with the flow and do not resist. You will fall sweetly into the embrace of love with the partner life has chosen for you. That is what Luhrmann said about his movie.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is by far one of my favourite bands and I absolutely loved their first album. The second album is alot more grown up, more real and less poppy. I didn't know what to expect with \\"SNGA\\", as most bands come back with a crappy second album, but not SP, they're still going strong!! A good mix to, some slow songs and also some heavier ones. My personal favourites are \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Everytime\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Promise\\". Well done guys!!
B000089HCR|5.0|W.A.S.P. may have changed a lot over the years. Like Black Sabbath and Megadeth, W.A.S.P. has had a rotating assembly of players with one man being the anchor of it all. Blackie Lawless is W.A.S.P. I have listened to W.A.S.P. since their debut when I was in 8th grade and never went away.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest 80's albums and an awesome debut for a band that was to go on for over twenty years. All the songs here are great and some are classic. The opening \\"I Wanna be Somebody\\" was and is a great anthem. This song will never die. It doesn't slow up with L.O.V.E. Machine either.<br /><br />\\"The Flame\\" is one of my all time favorite WASP tunes and I wish Blackie still performed this one live.<br /><br />\\"School Daze\\" is everything why the glory of 80's metal is so fondly remembered. It's furious, juvenille, and rebellious. I love it.<br /><br />The Hellion is a favorite of Blackie's and 'The Torture Never Stops' kicks ass.<br /><br />If you want your old school metal, W.A.S.P.'s debut will kick you into high gear. Chris Holmes stood by Blackie the longest and has some great guitar solos.<br /><br />But what the hell ever did happen to drummer Toni Richards? After this album he just disappeared off the face of the earth. Blackie claims to have shot him for having bad breath, and back in the 80's you would have believed it. So who knows.<br /><br />W.A.S.P. was at the top of their game on this release and they were only to grow and get better as time went on.
0743246616|4.0|This cookbook is even better than the first. The author is not a big fan of chocolate (she explains that herself) so don't buy it for chocolate recipes. She's a big fan of pecans and peanut butter. The recipes are very homey and delicious. If I'd never heard of Magnolia and received it as a gift, I'd be a happy woman. Hope you enjoy it, too.
0743455967|1.0|It's Mr. King's turn to give everyone instructions on how to write. Seems that he has become the 'real' expert now, considering he's made about 30 or so cheap pulp novels that are degrading to basic intelligence and writer's craftsmanship and yet best sellers. This boringly conversational book about literary craftsmanship should produce sleep in all those who find something oxymoronic in its conception. He may not be the most noble of stylists, and neither does he know how to make a story fly.<br /><br />In the arena of storytelling he argues for interesting situations rather than grouped plotting. ''Plot is, I think, the good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.'' Is he for real? He doesn't even attempt to be understood.<br /><br />'On Writing'' began as a compendium of tips and whines in a tone suitable for a lecture circuit or Internet discussion, nothing more. It also included a sharp, pungent account of Mr. King's growing up (being fat and getting beat up), finding a soul mate named Tabitha (whom he secretly thinks a witch), going through a rocky phase that involved taking drugs and drinking mouthwash (suicide attempts), and eventually discovering his professional destiny (to produce minor works). This makes for the most bizarre read ever, its so surreal that you won't believe you are reading a King biography. Then, through an outrageous twist of fate, it became something more, an attempt to be a best seller. Of course people will pick this up expecting a candid tale of his life, what they will get is a Monstrous accident described here in the most ironclad plotting.
B000002U8G|5.0|It would be folly to argue that any production of Pink Floyd's rates higher than their 1973 epic 'Dark Side of the Moon'.  But when you consider how 'Dark Side...' has been so thoroughly overplayed over the years, you may feel, as I do, that its relative value has been diminished.  I can hardly even listen to 'Money' anymore when it comes over the airwaves, and sliding the disc into the CD player always brings second thoughts.  Not so with 'Meddle', Pink's 1971 masterpiece and harbinger to 'Dark Side...'. <br /> <br />While much is made of the 23-plus minute opus that is 'Echoes', I'm a bit of a rebel in that it was always 'Side A' from the original vinyl disc that stirred my Pinka Colada.  I believe the first four songs on this disc are the Floyd's finest 20-plus minutes ever, and one of the finest album-sides of all time.  To me, 'Echoes' actually diminishes the overall value of the album.  Had the quality of 'Side B' matched 'Side A', we'd be talking a masterpiece on the order of 'Sgt. Pepper'.  <br /> <br />The CD opens with Floyd's finest instrumental piece, a true rock and roll screaming roller-coaster ride, 'One of These Days'.  The follow-up to this pulse-popping, audio-caffeine rush is the perfect tranquilizing elixer, 'A Pillow of Winds'.  If the title isn't enough to convince you of the profound delicacy of this number, consider the opening lyric, \\"A cloud of eiderdown draws around me, softening the sound\\".  It's the perfect contrast, and ironic complement, to 'One of These Days'.  And if that isn't good enough, the third track is actually the best number on the entire disc.  'Fearless' possesses an hypnotic acoustic guitar riff that I could listen to for double the Floyd's offering of six minutes, and often I do.  The lyrics are auditory modern art.  You can invest as much time as you wish investigating them and conjuring up meanings.  Topping it off is 'San Tropez', a melodious stroll along a musical boardwalk, non-chalantly charming us with thoughts such as, \\"Sooner than wait for a break in the weather, I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together, speeding away on a wind to a new day, if you're alone, I'll come home\\".  These four songs will leave you awash in a multi-textured rainbow of pleasures. <br /> <br />'Seamus' is certainly the odd-child in the family.  I have no use for it.  Performed in acoustic blues mode, with only a guitar, a vocal, and an annoying hound, it's less than a curiosity, and is sadly misplaced.  At a bit over two minutes long, it's a bit over two minutes too much. <br /> <br />The closer is 'Echoes', which begins to herald in the sound that would progress through 1972's soundtrack 'Obscured By Clouds' into 'Dark Side...'.  It's not a bad listen, and there are moments in the track where the instrumental production is especially gripping, and the lyrics again paint vivid pastoral pictures, in particular images of the natural world.  There is a middle segment that never fails to take me tripping back to the psychedelic patische of space travel portrayed by Stanley Kubrick in 1969's '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  Given that this Pink Floyd endeavor was produced in the following year, I've always wondered if there was a creative influence at work. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that 'Meddle' is a must-own for any fan of Pink Floyd, and for people interested in the very best of circa-1970 psychedelic music.  As it should be, the centerpiece of the accompanying booklet are page after page of blue-green (harkening to the lyric from 'Echoes', \\"and everything is green and submarine\\") psychedelic images and the wonderful lyrics, reproduced for your utter enjoyment and certain edification.  Take and eat of it.
B000059PPN|1.0|Why is it that Fulci fans are so die hard and fail to admit that the director didn't even make a decent horror film? After hearing so much about his films when i was a teen, and seeing all his gory make up on Fangoria magazines, i decided to finally rent some of his stuff. Was i ever disappointed, this film is ludicrous, mainly because it doesn't even resemble a horror film. Most of the time is wasted on back drop information that leads up to a banal climax.
0783222955|4.0|I must agree with a previous reviewer in which he/she stated that this film is dated and precious. It's a difficult film not only to watch but enjoy because the blacks in the film are all stereotypes of \\"decent, hard-working, god-fearing Black Folk.\\" Calpurnia, the housekeeper in the Finch household, best represents the film's black stereotype. As a previous reviewer stated, she is the least outspoken black in all of film history and consequently the least interesting. The role is so offensive that this film is immediately disqualified from being shown to anyone under the age of 21.  <br /> <br />I too wondered about Atticus being at home when his children were performing in a school play after dark. Was his day at the office sooooo fatiguing that he couldn't drag himself off the couch to accompany his children to school? Yes, it's okay for a good dad to impart important life lessons over the breakfast and dinner tables but shouldn't a good dad be concerned about his children's physical safety?  <br /> <br />Why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run around the neighborhood - after dark? The Finches appear not to live in the best of neighborhoods: once, a mad dog is seen loping along the street and another time, a neighbor fires a gun at a \\"prowler\\" in his vegetable garden, (the prowler is actually one of the Finch kids.) And then there's a dark, spooky old house that harbors a hulking, reclusive man who - like the Finch children - sneaks around the neighborhood after dark. Once again I ask: why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run about their dangerous and questionable neighborhood after dark? In my opinion, Atticus is truly over-rated as the Good Dad. <br /> <br />In the end, the entire film is just too precious as stated. It's the sort of film that appeals to those with very select tastes - like high school English teachers. This film is just the sort of fare I remember being bored with during my school days.  <br /> <br />You can safely pass on this one - but if you've dedicated your life to seeing every Gregory Peck film, or every film based on Pulitzer prize-winning novels, or every black and white film, you're duty-bound to take a look at it. The film is very dated and very precious - don't take it too seriously.
B00000K0DV|1.0|This is one of those 70's films that captures the urban stagnation of New York and brings absolutely no point to our intelligence. In trying to hop on the slasher band wagon created by ingenious American horrors, Fulci falls flat on his face, namely because there is no story or suspense and what a goof for a killer, a duck of all people! Avoid this at all costs, even the porn theater scene is dull because of the ugly naked women that look like drug users......
B00067BBQE|2.0|Evanescence is a great band and I was anxious to get this DVD. After watching it, I can safely say that whoever handled the filming/lighting/editing, etc. of this concert should never work again. The DVD SOUNDS awesome, but that's not the problem. The camera work is horrendous, the video editing is terrible, and the constant digital effects were extremely annoying. I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned it. You hardly ever see a shot that lasts more than 2 seconds without jumping onto something else for another 2 seconds, and this continues over and over and over. I am not exaggerating. I got dizzy. Amy Lee is in excellent voice but they kept taking the camera off her when she was really hitting her vocal stride. They didn't show the guitarists hardly at all, and we get numerous shots of the back of the drummer's head. I wanted to see the band jamming! You won't see that here unfortunately. Why would they do this? What a disappointment. There's intentional out of focus shots, poor lighting, and an array of unnecessary video effects. The video technician must have got a new toy and didn't know when to quit. I hope they release another concert DVD in the future that shows the band on stage, as you would see them in concert. This plays like one very long MTV video.
B00009TB5G|2.0|I picked this up because frankly there was nothing else to rent at the local video place and I expected it to be bad but not as terrible as it was. Most of the \\"great\\" reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely \\"eye candy\\" to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level. I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture. Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout. The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the \\"heros\\" should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs. Gosh, is this made for teens? My grade: D.
0060977493|5.0|There's really not much more to say beyond what's said, so this is mainly intended to be yet another vote for the book and confirmation of the opinions expressed here.

B00004WLXZ|1.0|I have heard so much about this \\"art\\" film that I couldn't help but purchase a copy, not that I was much intrigued by the subject or premise, personally, watching a bunch of fascist goons in their Sunday best does not feel very entertaining or intellectually stimulating. But I proceeded, how unbearable, lacking all artistry, this is nothing more than a documentary in which some moron holds a camera against the scene. It's black and white, very dull, extremely boring and without any merit, Leni was not very good as either a director or artist and on top of that she had dentures.
B0006399FS|5.0|25 years since U2's first single, and they still have what it takes to be the greatest band ever. This new CD is pure genius, and very personal. I can't wait to see how many Grammys they will receive on this one-- the CD has already gone to #1 in 21 countries according to [...] Way to go Bono, The Edge, Adam, & Larry. U2 still rocks. I have been a fan since 1983, and I still love this group because they just keep improving with age.<br /><br />Sincerley,<br /><br />the-Bono-freak (;

Edge's guitar sounds great, and Edge's backing vocals on \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is breathtakingly beautiful. This is my favorite track on the new CD--I lost my father to lung cancer in 1991, and the song says a lot--I thank Bono for his honest lyrics in this song.<br /><br />U2 has done it again, and they will continue to be the #1 rock group in the world--CD has already gone to #1 in 21 countries...next come the Grammy Awards, the Mtv Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and so on...<br /><br />I also can't wait for the tour to begin...long live U2 and I will long be a fan of this group as I have been since 1983.<br /><br />U2 rocks-<br /><br />the-bono-freak (;
B00008RV1L|1.0|This film is boring from the start and I couldn't wait until the end when all my suspicions would be put to the test. What I was expecting is at least an attempt to make an interesting picture. This movie suffers from confusing direction and bad plot lines. We don't know whether to take this movie at face value and think of it as satire (badly done) or a horror film (even worse). Bale is terrible as a spoiled yuppie who has an urge to kill and have sex and wash his (blank) clean. This doesn't even bring interest to a retarded person, I don't know what film the reviewers saw who gave it thumbs up, they must have been drunk.
B00005T30L|4.0|Ghost World is a cleaned up and slightly happier adaptation of the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes. I can't help but compare the two lead characters, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) to MTV's animated anti-heroes, Daria and Jane. Their attitude and their approach to life is in the same vein, and Daria fans will definitely get a kick out of this film.    Enid and Rebecca, finishing up high school, are starting to deal with life but aren't really sure what that means. They are as cynical as you would expect two hip teens who rule their town to be, and that means criticizing everything in sight.    Enid reaches a turning point when she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi) after playing a practical joke on him. He's a nebbishy collector of 78 rpm jazz discs and even he admits to being a loser himself. Yet, Enid still enters his world and finds out some things about him, his favorite music, herself and her feelings about life, all of which she uses in her make up art class to earn her diploma. What she doesn't count on is how all of her relationships change because of it. And they change in a drastic way.    Besides the film's story, both amusing and brutal in that \\"teen angst\\" way, the look of it is just brilliantly done. It bursts, like a comic book, with vivid color and that adds to the overall tone. And a great, great soundtrack of vintage blues gives it the perfect musical note.    Birch and Johansson are both stellar in their roles. And Buscemi does his typical convincing work in what could have been a caricature part. Also notable are the great supporting performances by Brad Renfro as the convenience store clerk pal of the pair, Illeana Douglas as the damaged art instructor and Bob Balaban as Enid's dad.    The disc also features some nifty extras, including the full music video of the song that opens the film, and some very funny outtakes and extended scenes with the shirtless guy at the mini mart, plus a short \\"making of\\" documentary and a couple ofother goodies.    Highly recommended.

0688163173|3.0|I really think I read this book.  But I might be on LSD in an insane ward and tricked into dreaming that I read it.  Either way, it was entertaining up to the end.  Except there wasn't an end - only loose ends.  The author just gave up, leaving countless red herrings flopping around.  Though I might be imagining those too.  I did skip all the WAY TOO LONG hallucination sequences, unless it was all a hallucination.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother to read / hallucinate this story again but will be glad to try another one by Lehane.  If it was by him and not by me.

0440238609|5.0|I love this book series! the first book was kind of hard to get through because it was longer than i'm accustomed to,but it's fascinating! a real sci-fi meets fantasy thriller/adventure series! you quickly fall in love with lyra and pan and then learn to love and cherish will who becomes their best friend in the subtle knife. their epic tale of mystery, betrayal, adventure, friendship and heroism trascends worlds and genres. A must read!!
B000002UJQ|4.0|Honestly this album is alright, but not Radiohead's best. I'm one of the rare \\"unstereotypical\\" music listeners that thinks \\"The Bends\\" is their best album. <br /> <br />As for the deeming of 90's best album, sorry but I think it is in the top ten best albums, but behind \\"The Bends,\\" Bjork's \\"Post\\" and \\"Homogenic, Lauryn Hill's \\"Miseducation,\\" and Madonna's \\"Ray of Light.\\" <br /> <br />Yes it also depends on what type of music your ears like but any \\"real\\" music listener couldn't argue with Bjork's \\"Post or Homogenic,\\" or even Madonna's \\"Ray of Light.\\"  <br /> <br />I love Radiohead, but this album, as well as themselves, are clearly overated. In my opinion, Bjork is the best in Alterantive Music. Ask any major music reviewing magazine. They do call her \\"the Queen of Alternative.\\" What's left to answer is, \\"Who is the king(s).\\" Clearly not Radiohead. <br /> <br />All in all, this album shouldn't be your first purchase if Radiohead is unknown to your ears. Go pick up \\"The Bends,\\" this is next if you like what you hear.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I honestly don't see why people feel the need to write a 1 star review bashing Britney Spears. This is an album review, NOT an artist review. If you feel like trash talking Britney then go to a chat room. Having said that, I have been a fan of her music since Baby One More Time and like each cd better than the one before. The 3 new songs are fantastic and I'm looking forward to her return. The packaging is great as well as the bonus cd.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The Matrix, with it's state of the art action sequences, hyper designed internal reality ( heavily influenced by the kinetic stylings of Japanese Anime) and philosophical leanings has clearly become one of the touchstones of modern cinematic science fiction. This film (along with \\"2001 A Space Oddesy\\", and \\"Star Wars\\") managed to capture the imagination and redefine the visual vocabulary of our popular culture (how many \\"bullet time\\" commercials and videos have you seen?) and fulfill one of science fictions greatest promises - to entertain by the sheer force of ideas. So it seems only fitting that the films directors the Wachowski Brothers have compiled the definitive Matrix collection, a massive and comprehensive 10 disk offering that should satiate the most hardcore of fans, and provide the definitive document for what has clearly become a science fiction milestone, and (wouldn't yah know) it's just in time for Christmas.    Perhaps the worth of this massive offering is debatable. Will the average action SciFi movie goer be interested in the philosophical musings of the author Ken Wilber? Hard to say, but the Wachowski's impressive SciFi statement does pack an extra punch when seen sequentially, and with extra DVD's filled with detailed commentaries and behind the scene bio's (that are sometimes just as entertaining as the films themselves) this box set is clearly another, and perhaps final, part of the Matrix mythos. It's such an impressive offering that one has to wonder if the forward thinking Wachowski's had envisioned this package all along.  And let's face it, the real value in this box set (and most others, the brilliant Lord of the Rings extended versions excluded) are not the films themselves but the added material.  True, this offering is for the hardcore, but it's been a long time since a SciFi film fan could bask in the glow of a well realized vision, and as any true SciFi fan will tell you, they LOVE to be hardcore.    While it's clear that the two following films \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" lacked the inventive spark and philosophical weight of the first film, when seen as part of a larger package it's a bit easier to forgive the Wachowski's shortcomings (can anyone say \\"Tribal Techo party\\"?) and be impressed by their sheer vision, ambition and determination which this weighty box set encapsulates perfectly. Chances are you already know a few lunatic Matrix fans who would love this celebration of ideas and excess this Christmas, and who can blame them, in a world of war and electoral fatigue the red pill sounds just about perfect right now.
B000002B1M|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, It Was Written was the perfect follow-up to Illmatic.  Unlike some other artists, he can follow-up a classic with another one. <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks: The Message, Street Dreams, and Affirmative Action  (don't get me wrong, the whole CD is hot, but these are the songs that stand out)
B0000CFW87|5.0|One has to hand it to this immensly talented vocalist. Josh Groban continue to impress with each CD release. <br /> <br />Groban has mastered \\"Classipop.\\" His voice never offends or is overbearing. He also has a killer range as a singer. On certain selections, Groban's higher register is impressive and powerful. <br /> <br />\\"Closer\\" also illustrates Groban continues to grow not only vocally but now as a songwriter as well: \\"Remember When It Rained\\" is haunting. Groban has an uncanny ability to grab the listener and take them into the song. \\"My Confession\\" is just pure brillance. mi mancherai, featuring Joshua Bell is a just a merging of two beautiful instruments. His foreign language efforts only further illustrate the depth and beauty of his voice. <br /> <br />The ballads featured on \\"Closer\\" are never heavy-handed or bland. \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" and \\"Broken Vow\\" meld nicely with the other titles. <br /> <br />Produce David Foster continues to be a huge influence in Groban's career. Foster, whose catalog usually favors females has finally found that rare gem in Groban: a classic male voice who contines to deliver one incredible performance after another.

B000286S8S|5.0|As a classic rock fan I always really liked Van Halen, but never got around to buying the albums (Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and my ska obsession always got in the way).  When I heard that this two-disc set was coming out with a whopping 36 tracks I was very excited.  I paid less than $20 at WalMart (college kids lack the luxury of finer music stores sometimes!) for 36 songs by one of the best rock bands ever.  I am absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this music - but if you already own a few Van Halen albums naturally it makes sense to not get this, you'll already own half of the material.  But if you're like me and don't have the cash to throw around for seven or so albums, this is a great choice.  I am VERY pleased with it, the crappy editing job on the end of \\"Finish What You Started\\" notwithstanding (its really too bad that's cut off like it is, since I love that song).  Definitely worth the $19 I paid for it!
B000002GKT|5.0|Not the best album of all time. They ruin it with their extended jams on \\"...Splinters\\" and \\"Rollin' Stone\\". But what a heavy, hard rock, blistering, British, Les Paul guitar through Marshall stack Steve Marriot rock-fest! Stoner rock? Lick rock? Classic rock? I dunno...it sure is classic though. And I've been listening it for what seems like centuries and I still throw on the disc at least once a month to remind me of how rock used to rock, if you know what I mean. You don't? Well, if you think Peter Frampton is all about teen idol BS AOR FM schlock, think again. This was a fantastic band, and one of their best albums, and one of the best albums of the 1970s. Mixed by Eddie Kramer, no less. Take that all you posers.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I haven't bought this item yet, but I will be getting it tomorrow, and I CAN'T WAIT.  This is just a note to dave911, regarding his review.  The Korn cover from Evanescence is \\"Thoughtless,\\" not \\"My Last Breath.\\" <br />\\"My Last Breath\\" was on their album, Fallen. . .
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has done it again.  What a great album that is American Idiot.  I've seen Green Day twice live and all I can say is show me where to buy the tickets.  I saw them in Athens, GA on their Warning tour which was a great experience.  The show being general admisson meant we could work our way to the front row which we did.  Seeing these guys live 10 feet away from you is something every fan should get a chance to do.  As for their new album I think it's probably my favorite one.  I'm glad these guys are still making great music.  It's hard to believe Dookie was ten years ago, man I feel old.
B00005JMXX|1.0|All scientific \\"fact\\" is thrown out of the way of this disaster, goofy dialog, cardbord characters, unbelievable  happenings, but the special efects were the only high point of this film, what would Homer Hickam think?, probably a lot of laughs, if you put your brain in the \\"deep freeze\\" then this is your masterpiece! I recommend this epic ONLY if your having a bad movie party!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Yes, Madleine sounds something like Billy Holiday. Madeleine's voice, actually, is a little more in control than Billy's. But that quaver in Billy's voice gave it character, as though she were on the verge of some emotional breakthrough or breakdown, take your pick. Madeleine does it her way, a little different. You compare. But you don't have to decide who is better. It's just great to hear them both. Music is not a contest. Now, on race. Jazz fans are probably the least racist people on earth. So when someone intimates she's OK for a white singer, they're nuts. We jazz fans buy according to sound, not pigmentation. This lady has got it. Talent, choice of songs, backup, arrangements. It's all there. What a find. Madeleine, come to L.A. You'll get fans of all colors, I promise you. Jazz fans.
B000003TAW|4.0|ok...i only give it a 4 cuz it has 10 songs....WHY oh WHY can't it be longer??!!!! nerds of the 90's...UNITE!!! all thanks 2 weezer. rock on. weezer still lives on 4ever...no matter what you say! don't be hatin. this is an awesome cd...yea..it's old, but what great cd isn't? like nimrod by green day, or out come the wolves by rancid!!!! theyre old, but they kick ass.
B00006879E|5.0|I am a lover of all types of music, especially hip-hop and R&B.  Some of my co-workers were talking about music, and a friend of mine spoke highly of these guys.  I was skeptical at first, but I saw the video for \\"This Love\\" and I loved Adam's delivery and the beat of the song.  I bought the CD a few days ago, and I listened to it as I was driving home.  The truth is, I was shocked at what I heard.  This group has so much talent.  Their fusion of rock, soul, and funk had me groovin' all the way home.  I really enjoyed it!!
B00005ATQD|5.0|I've read all the reviews, and have found Roger Ebert's very interesting. <br />But I see parallels to the greek tragedy of Ulysses as told in the Odyssey. <br /> <br />To me, this is a cautionary tale of the nightmarish scenarios possible when people fail to just go home. To be where they belong and to realize what they don't belong doing. <br /> <br />Ulysses on an unnecessary raid at the end of the Trojan war blinds the eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes, infuriating the god Neptune, who refuses to permit Ulysses to return home to Ithaca. And so begins the Odyssey of Ulysses. <br /> <br />When you watch Tom Cruise's character in this movie spend two nights wandering in the sexual underworld of New York City, you watch a Sexual Odyssey emerge like a daydream about possibilites missed, the opportunity to jump off avoided and responsibilites shunned. You realize at any moment here he can head home and face up to his realities, but he plunges deeper into a nightmarish dream. Or is it? <br /> <br />After visiting one of his patients, Dr. Bill Harford can just go home to his wife and family and face the facts that his wife shared with him (while high from marijuana) a sexual fantasy she had experienced a year earlier. But he can't. He seems haunted by her revelations. And jealous. And perhaps motivated by her revelations to experiment. <br /> <br />Thus begins his Odyssey. <br /> <br />
B0000039LE|3.0|I watched this movie for the first time right before Halloween hoping to get in the mood with a good spooky movie. It turns out, this movie - overall - did not frighten me the way the reviews say. Honestly, it has got a great atmosphere and mood, but ultimately it fails to deliver. Why does it fail? Because Michael Myers is just not scary enough for me because he is human. Even though he is psycho, he is still human and his dark motive is initiated by his disorder and not his own ideas. I just think it is just not enough to create Myers as a scary guy. This movie is more disturbing if anything, but definately not terrorful.
0312305060|2.0|Here's a \\"novel\\" approach to winning a pulitzer prize: simply copy an existing novel.  <br /> <br />I liked this better the first time when it was called \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".
B00005RHGK|4.0|I read a lot of bad reviews on this movie and I just have to say it was not as bad as they say. The ending was not as terrible as some think, however the middle part was a little confusing. This said, I really enjoyed watching this movie and the two main characters were very good and believable. The creeper is tremendously cool, however I do think they could have made him a little more gruesome instead of futuristic looking. The first 45 minutes of the movie is wicked scary with the truck that chases them and the part where the see the creeper staring at them after dumping off the bodies in the pipe (probably the scariest image I've ever seen). I haven't seen the sequel, but this movie was really fun to watch and is not as awful as some reviews set it out to be.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|Like your previous reviewers, I was also at one of the 2 gigs filmed for this release. It was the first time I had seen The Stripes and afterwards I rated it as one of the most exciting perfomances I had witnessed in over 30 years of attending rock concerts.  There is,  of course,  the danger that a film of a concert you attended failing to match up to the memory you have of it. This is not the case with this DVD. The 8mm grainy film quality certainly adds to the atmosphere. You can almost feel the sweat from the audience as they bounce up and down on the sprung ballroom floor, despite the fact that it was below freezing outside on that cold January evening. There are no extras, just the concert, which is how it should be. The packaging is nice though. Buy it now. Highly recommended to get you jumping around the room.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I absolutely love the symbolism used in this very original movie.  The movie seems almost to have subliminal messages in it that bash the principles of Christianity.  A large person, who represents an angel of God, dresses in a large bunny suit and informs Donny of when his world will end, though the movie portrays it to be the whole world.  Jim Cunningham, a motivational speaker, draws a deranged belief that all things come from the emotions of fear and love, the basic principles of Christianity.  This movie will make you think about the messages portrayed in it and what it truly means.
0679745653|4.0|I am a high school student and am actually working on a school project. I was a assigned a decade in history and was required to pick a novel to read and review. I have to admit that in the beginning I was not looking forward to the assignment. I am not an avid reader and actually don't read unless it is required. I am not sure why, I have just not been captivated by very many books(partly because I haven't read very many).<br /><br />Keeping all of this is in mind, I began reading Breakfast at Tiffany's. And I have to admit that the one of the reasons I chose the book was because I have both heard the song and seen the movie. So upon starting reading, I realized that I am possibly the slowest reader alive. It took me forever to read this book of no longer than 200 pages.<br /><br />The story starts out very confusing, but eventually clears up. There is this girl, Holly Gothily, who is very strange. She seems to be a sort of sleazy character, who picks up a lot of men and tends to sleep around. She lives in an apartment near another man. This man, not one of her \\"clients\\", is charmed by her simplicity and uniqueness. He begans to investigate her life until one night she drops in.<br /><br />They talk and she sort of tells him about herself. Little does he know that she has a past that would shock this quiet author. She was married at fourteen and had four children. She abandoned them and left for New York City. This is where she began her present scandals. When these scandals become too much for her she goes to Tiffany's and has drinks with Joe Bell. This sort of calms her. It is a place where she can go and forget all of her troubles. We all need a place like this. A serene, quiet place where we can do what Holly does, forget all of our present troubles, even just for a while.<br /><br />At the climax of the novel, Holly's newfound lover, Jose, leaves her and says that she is too much for him. She then leaves to go to Brazil, a place where her and this lover were supposed to get married. She leaves in search of a new Tiffany's, one that she will never find. What makes me so mad is that all she needed to do was realize that her Tiffany's was with the man who she spent so much time with. The man that she never could see herself being involved with, her friend. This is important in that she thought she did not have friends. She did though and she just never realized it, her Tiffany's.<br /><br />I believe that this book is a result of the times. The book was written in 1958 and focuses mainly on the end of the 50's and the beginning of the 60's with WWII. Holly seems to me to be what everyone wishes they could have been. It seems as though people like Holly were not evident and if they were they were looked down on, as Holly was. I feel though, even though people may have ridiculed her, deep down she was what they wanted to be.
0786869143|3.0|I had heard of similar books on attracting luck.  I did like this book in that it showed practical and logical methods to being more \\"lucky\\".  There is no hokus pokus in Wiseman's theory.   <br /> <br />Only drawback that it is a little stodgy in the writing and it is not long enough.  Still anyone who is looking for a change in their fortunes should consider this title.

B00030590I|2.0|That was the point of the movie in a nutshell ---- and that the individual's needs are not nearly as important as the group's.  Not really all that surprising; it is a Chinese movie.   <br /> <br />My care for the story slowly disintegrated as the movie plodded along, with fight scenes that were half-hearted --- some just pointless.   <br /> <br />No amount of color filters could save this film.   <br />

B000007MVD|5.0|With \\"Live At The BBC\\", you get the discover the Beatles' strong fascination with American r 'n' r and r 'n' b, and at this early point of their career they already showed their exceptional talent as songwriters and intrepreters of many Top 40 hits. <br /> <br />Whatever they did, like covering songs such as \\"Soldier Of Love\\", \\"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\\", \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You\\", \\"To Know Her Is To Love Her\\", etc., etc., they did them surprisingly well.  Not to mention that this 2-cd record (entirely in mono) also showcases their famous sense of humor, joking around and bantering with BBC hosts. <br /> <br />With that, I would like to think of the Beatles not as the most phenomenal and influential pop band of all time, but the Beatles as any other rollicking good bar band, doing those songs in their own personal best.  And the most important thing is, they really had fun in doing it. <br /> <br />I wasn't even yet born in that era, but listening to \\"Live At The BBC\\" makes as if I already have lived in those carefree but innocent times, savoring those good ol' songs (but they still sound fresh!) that take me back down memory lane.  This is really irresistible--you should have this one, too. <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|First of all, I'm a fan of U2; have been since I was a teenager: loved War and Unforgettable Fire.  Grew up while watching their style evolve: loved Achtung and Zooropa (and elements of Pop).  Was bored by All That You Can't Leave Behind.  So, I had high expectations that HTDAAB was going to be a great album.  Boy was I disappointed.  Vertigo was a real tease that this album was going to be earth-shattering and upbeat.  While I found the lyrics on HTDAAB to be stronger than in the recent past, I found the music dull and monotonous.  I guess I should have seen this coming: they look bored in the video for Vertigo and the iPod commercial would have made a better video!
B0000630BT|5.0|In my opinion, yes. <br /> <br />Ok, I have been listening to metal for about 18 years, in all its forms.I have a 40gb ipod full to the brim with metal.Entire catalogues of Black Sabbath,Ozzy,Megadeth,Metallica,Slayer,Priest,AC/DC....you get the picture. <br />The opening track Painkiller on this album stands on the shoulders of everything on my ipod!In my opinion it is EASILY the best heavy metal song I have ever heard.It has everything,and I mean everything! insane drum intro, awesome guitar riffs, the most insane screaming vocals from Rob Halford, utterly absurd lyrics that fit perfectly.Everytime I hear this song I fall to my knees playing an imaginary flying V, pulling a face like someone has just stuck a red hot poker up my ****  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is irrelevant because you MUST own this album for the title track alone. <br /> <br />Like I said before, I love all metal, JP is not my favourite band, and this is not my favourite album.But the song Painkiller stands alone as THE song to define all that is great about this genre of music. <br /> <br />Incidentally, Rob's back and they are touring with the Scorpions, I'll be at the front in leathers, cut off denim jacket, Maiden patch (Piece of Mind), arms raised to the heavens.See you there!! <br /> <br />
B000002JQ6|4.0|First off, I'm not a huge AC/DC fan.  I love their hits, and enjoy the rest of their material, but not enough to go out and buy all their albums.  If you're like me, this is one of the few AC/DC records that's really essential.  Most of their big hits are here--with extra live energy, and sounding great.  Nothing beats the crowd chanting \\"Angus\\" in the beginning of \\"Thunderstruck.\\"  AC/DC's dirty style lends well to a live album--they don't do a lot of overdubs, so it's pretty much the same sound as on the album, with a crowd that actually adds to the record's merit for a change.  It's good to hear all the hits live--\\"Back in Black,\\" \\"You Shook Me,\\" \\"Highway to Hell,\\" and \\"T.N.T.\\" all sound top-form, but it's also good to hear the less well-known tunes like \\"The Jack,\\" and \\"For Those About to Rock.\\"  I'm sure huge fans would disagree that  this album is satisfactory for the full AC/DC experience, but I bet they don't deny that it's a hell of a good live album of their favorite band.  Check it out as a good retrospective, and if you like it a ton, check out more of their classic albums.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I'm not going to go into how much I hate Kill Bill and how disappointing it was compared to Pulp and all that, but i must admit that i was awake for much longer watching this one than the first. It was a little less painful dialogue-wise (except Bill's Superman remark in the end, which was supposed to somehow interpret a comic book into phylosophy ...of superheroes maybe? (nice try Quentin ;) anyway...) than the first, and I thought had a better story line. Had it been some other movie without Uma Thurman DESPERETALY trying hard to keep an angry face through the long Vol. 2, and without having nasty old fart Bill trying to bring everyone pain, i woulda liked it. Say if it was about that dude who lived in the trailer home in the middle of the desert and was like an outlaw or something shooting people with his shotgun, screwing hookers, robbin' banks and getting drunk (and occasionally sitting down with his buddies and then butting in Tarantino's philosopy of life into the flick) then i woulda liked it. Till then i'll be watching Pulp for the 20th time. Nah j/k.
6300183211|5.0|This movie is a classic, hands down. Show me a better actor besides Al Pacino to play \\"Scarface\\", and I'll give you my next few paychecks. When I saw this for the first time at the movies, my friends thought I was nuts. I told them they were nuts for not taking the time to see this classic film. Since then, I have watched this movie about 50 times,and it NEVER gets old, ever. In fact, it gets even better!     Set in South Florida in the Early 1980s, Tony Montana uses his wit and savvy to rise from poverty as a Cuban immigrant to become a dominant and feared druglord in Miami and beyond. In addition, the bloody and brutal slaying of a friend drives him even further to succeed. Estranged from his mother and sister, he re-unites with his sibling, but she eventually becomes entagled in the life of crime, degredation and violence. Friendships are formed, trust is forged, but both are quickly broken by greed and power. While attempting somewhat of a \\"family\\" life by marrying his wife played by Michelle Phiffer, Tony prefers money, power and coke as his true and only love. Tony Montana realizes in the end, he himself can trust no one, and is his own and only best friend. 20 plus years later, \\"Scarface\\" is still respected and idolized by the urban and \\"gansta\\" scene, and a famous group bears his name in homage to him. Get this movie!

B00008AWOD|5.0|When I first bought this album, I was amazed. Simply the opener 'Bulletproof Cupid' gets me in the mood with it's loud, snearing guitars. But it's also a false start of the album. It gives the impression that it's going to be a hard, loud album, but it turned out to be a slow, ballad-like album...wich is actually a good thing! 'English Summer Rain' gets some electronic sounds into the album, although I don't like it that much, but great song. I like the opening phrases of 'This Picture', wich is again a great song. At first I didn't like the title track 'Sleeping With Ghosts', a ballad. But it quickly grow on me, and now I think it's one of the stand out tracks of the album.. 'soulmates never die', it really touches you. The reason why I bought this CD is because of 'The Bitter End' and i believe everyone has at least heard it once before. One of my favourite Placebo - songs (my favorite is 'Slave To The Wage'), it brings back some of the power of the opener track, it's another stand out. I disliked 'Something Rotten' at first, but now it's an OK song, they made worse songs than this one. 'Plastice' is good, but not great. I never liked 'Special Needs' much (I really don't know why), but now I think it's pretty good. 'I'll Be Yours' and 'Second Sight' are both good songs. 'Protect Me From What I Want' is another stand out. It's slighty depressing (not a bad thing) and the lyrics are amazing. 'Centrefolds' is a good closing track, a could be considered another stand out track. <br />Clonclusion: this is an excellent album, but 'Placebo' and 'Without You I'm Nothing' are still better in my opinion. This is also the most accessible Placebo-album so if you're new to Placebo I recommend this one. My favourite stays their debut-album, but this found a spot into my soul :) Buy it!
B0006399FS|2.0|...is too generous for this album. <br /> <br />\\"City\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" warrant a shot, but the rest of the album is vague an unimaginative.  They're the rock Gods- what else do they need to do?  This album doesn't sound like a band who really wants it anymore to me. <br /> <br />I know this is a matter of taste, but I've loved U2 through their Zooropa and Pop days (both albums were AWESOME- I know I'm in the minority with that opinion) and this album is nowhere close to their best. <br /> <br />My main criticism is that this album sounds like a B-sides album with one new single put on it to sell (Vertigo).  It sounds unfinished and unedited.  Everytime I hear Bono say things like \\"listen to me now\\" and \\"I need to let you know\\" and blah blah- it just sounds like filler to me.  Bono was been criticized for being preachy- this album has plenty of fodder.  If people like preachy-  this album is great. <br /> <br />While you may not like Pop and Zooropa- the WRITING was still top notch compared to this album.  Go back and REALLY listen to them after you hear HTAAB- you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />People forget that there have been a lot of U2 albums that weren't especially strong in the '80s (in terms of hits).  This album is probably more like that than their late '80s- early '90's stuff.   <br /> <br />We have to face it- this band is past its prime.  They were the band of the '80's and '90s (which isn't bad).  U2 is fading slowly away into oblivion... <br /> <br />Bono always said \\"2 crap albums and you're out.\\"  Well. This counts as one.  We'll see what they release in 2008.

B00000IPAX|5.0|If I feel like listening to something that will make me feel happy, I put on Enema of the State. Its lyrics are OK but juvenile and nothing special, there's not much variety in the music, and it definitely doesn't break new ground musically. None of these things bother me, and if they bother you, this album will get old fast for you. <br /> <br />What I like about this album is the fact that it barrels along with a lot of energy on every track except Adam's Song, which is rare among catchy hook-filled albums. Usually a band making pop music tries to put some slow, sensitive stuff in there, which often ruins the whole thing. In this way Enema of the State is similar to ska, and if you like (liked?) ska, you'll like this album a lot. It's consistently upbeat and there are no tracks that are worth skipping. On the other hand, if you like music more for what it means to you than how it sounds, you probably won't like this album much.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Ok, when i was a little kid i remember watchin this movie. I was like 5 or something, and since then i have looked and looked and looked, any finally i rented it once, then i really didnt have time to watch it, so i kept looking and looking, and the only place i could ever think of is somewhere online. So today i finally bought both of them! I just loved this movie the first time i saw it! Im 18 now, and im still thinking, i cant wait till those movies get to my door step! I would reccomend this movie to anybody, yes it may be a little Korny, but who cares! This is one of those movies you will charish for a lifetime!
0395389496|5.0|First of all, I remember this story from when I was a girl and when I saw the movie and books come out again I remembered what a magical story it was and how all I wanted was to ride the Polar Express and get one of Santa's sleigh bells. Now, I got this book for my son who loves Christmas and trains. I am saving it for Christmas, but I am not worried. I KNOW he will love this book. This is a definate keeper forever. I got the hardcover. Personally I want this book to last untill I am so old I cant read anymore. This is one of the best childrens books there is out there. Not just for Christmas, but for all time. After I got the book, I sat down and took the journey again by myself. You are never too old to feel the magic.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|In 1983 I payed over $40 for a bootlegged video off the Dortmund show - one of the 3 included here. If the guy who sold it to me had had the Rainbow show and the Hammersmith one too I would have payed him $120 back then without hesitation! At todays value that must be over $250 and here we are paying way way less plus we're getting way way more! I cried watching the 3 shows - being transported back over 20 years to an amazing time in rock music - a great feeling. Thankyou Iron Maiden for this incredible DVD - the BEST yet!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've read some reviews complaining whining about the scant political content of this brilliant cd. First of all its entertainment in the context of a \\"concept\\". Second this band is comprised of a trio of \\"artist\\" in the punk realm, with me so far? Punk derived from a backlash to political and socio-economic<br />staus quo. Green Day roots are from that punk past. What do you think Rock the Casbah by the Clash was about? With that said Green Day transcends the genre and has created a unique and clever concept album. From the maiden voyage of the main character in \\"jesus of suburbia\\"to its epilogue this cd takes you on a emotional narrative journey without once sacrificing their artistic punk cred and quite frankly rockin it out like they never have before! The stand outs \\"American Idiot\\" \\"On Holiday\\" \\"She's a Rebel\\" \\"Jesus Of Sububia\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" are just samplings of a new classic album we will be hearing for a long time. I guarantee that everytime you pop this one into your player,you'll always listen to it from begining to end.I'd rather listen to Green Day pontificate their political views than listen to Ashlee Simpson lip sych through her acid reflux to \\"Pieces of Crap\\".
0790729628|5.0|While I think I prefer the directors cut to the original (although I'm not as adamant about it as some), I've noticed something in recent years.  There's alot of us out there who swear by this movie, but almost all of us saw it for the first time as the theatrical version.  People seeing the directors cut fot the first time don't seem to like it as well. <br /> <br />As akward as the voice over was (I didn't think it was that bad to begin with), I've begun to believe it was neccesary at least for the first or second viewing.  Some very important, beautiful subtext just may not be there strongly enough without it. <br /> <br />So if you're a first timer and you can actually find the original version, start with that. <br /> <br />Why I like the movie-  Harrison Ford is fine in this.  Yes he is a bit flat, as people say (course I think he usually is).  What's interesting about this movie on a character basis is not Deckard, but Roy Battey.  Roy Battey is one of my all time favorite movie characters.  The murderous genious child man who hasn't had enough time to understand morality and wants nothing more than time.  The ending of the movie makes sitting through the slow bits completely worth while. <br /> <br />I think it's the ommision of the voice over explanation of some of the events at the end of the film that seems to be making it more challenging for new audeinces.  The visuals, textures and ideas are why this film is good, but it's the ending that made this film great.
B00030590I|5.0|On a scale of five stars, this visually stunning masterpeice deserves about a thirty-five. Its by far the best movie I've seen in my life and I will never forget it. When I first walked into the movie theater, I thought, yah another martial arts action, get the bad guys, typical Jet Li movie, but was completely proven wrong by what I saw. It's not only the action that makes it awesome, but the concept, the action is more of like a side-thrill, and it is greatly done. But, the message of the movie is what will grip your soul and what gave me goosebumps for three hours after the movie was over. It almost brought me to tears. The only set back was the idiots in the theater who chose to laugh during the fight scenes. (some people find the flying thing amusing [like in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon] ).
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|A fantastic CD that every fan of the movie should own!  Has classics like Joni Mitchell's \\"Both Sides Now\\" and the Beach Boys \\"God Only Knows\\" side by side with Modern Day Classics like DIDO's \\"Here With Me\\" (one of my personal TOP TEN all time favorites!) and Kelly Clarkson's \\"The Trouble With Love Is\\".  Pity that the producers didn't include a new track from Pop/Rock Artist AMBER that fits the theme of the movie perfectly: \\"Just Like That (Romeo and Juliet)\\" from her fantastic new \\"My Kind of World\\" CD.  This Pat Benatar-esque track has \\"Pop Radio Hit\\" written all over it and would have given the Soundtrack some radio exposure!  My advice?  Get BOTH \\"Love Actually\\" Soundtrack and Amber - My Kind of World.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought recently this album and I must say that it was a very refreshing discovery.  Madeleine has a very beautiful voice that seems to come out of her effortlessly.  Without a doubt this album should be one of the new classics in the Vocal front, competing favorabily with some of the new talents like Norah Jones and Diana Krall as well as the all time Jazz classics. <br /> <br />The music is a combination of soft jazz with very nice piano and trumpet arrangements that serve as a elegant and powerful backdrop for madeleine's remarkable vocal capabilities.  If you want to go and try a couple of songs, I recomend you to listen to \\"Dance me to the end of Love\\" and \\"You are going to make me Lonesome when you Go\\", these two will give you a very good idea of what to expect in the album. <br /> <br />Easily one of the best vocal releases of 2004.

0780619951|3.0|One of the craziest remakes of a remake of a remake that was totally a waste of talent from such top shelf stars.  Marlon Brando walks around most of this picture as if he were on medication.  What was that thimble on his head?  Or was it an ice chest?  Who knows...who really cares.  Val Kilmer looks as if he were looking for his agent to get him out of this crazy thing.  The one thing this film has going for it is the special effects.  Its also very quirky, but stick with the 1977 Burt Lancaster version.  Its much better.
B00009L1TA|1.0|John Travolta as a soldier, cop, DEA agent or any sort of gun-weilding protagonist is simply not believable, therefore, the pretext for \\"Basic\\" is flawed before the story ever takes root. <br />  <br />Travolta reached his peak when he took top billing in \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", doing a great job of portraying a Brooklyn kid who is coming of age during the 70's disco era. But, outside of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" it's been all downhill after that, with a string of failures like \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"Broken Arrow\\", \\"Battlefield Earth\\", \\"Swordfish\\", and lest we forget, \\"Look Who's Talking II\\". <br />  <br />In \\"The Thin Red Line\\" Travolta played a U.S. Army General officer by method acting, evidently by imitating a talking plant. This huge miscasting no doubt greatly contributed to the failure of that film to garner any sort of approval by veiwing audiences.  <br /> <br />\\"Basic\\" is another such failure. Casting Travolta in a roles like the DEA agent he plays in this film is like a kiss of death for the entire project. For one thing, the idea that his character is a former Army Ranger is a hoot. Casting somebody like Pauly Shore or maybe even Martin Short as a a former Army Ranger would be more believable. <br />  <br />Very predictably, Travolta manages to stink up the whole story, which isn't all that great to begin with. Yet, with an extremely limited acting range, Travolta continues to crank out box office bomb after bomb after bomb.  <br /> <br />Oh well... That's Hollywood politics. After all, no one ever went broke underestimating the sophistication of the American public... <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|I had high hopes for U2's latest CD especially after hearing the blistering title track, Vertigo. Thinking it was just a preview of things to come, I was surprisingly disappointed. Tracks are mellow, too mellow, and made me want to fast forward to the next song until I reached the end of the CD. This is supposed to be a rock album? Doesn't sound like it to me. By far the best track is the opener, Vertigo, and Miracle Drug kind of grows on you but I can't say the same for the rest of the album. Let's just say that if any other band was releasing this CD, people's reactions would be far more restrained. Also, I felt ripped off that the lyrics weren't included and the special edition is not worth spending the extra money on unless you want to see an outline of all the band members' hands.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|Elaine Benes was right! She couldn't stand it and neither could I!<br /><br />Let's call a spade a spade... \\"The English Patient\\" is a \\"Chick Flick\\" from beginning to end. It's not an epic - it's a 3-hour soap opera! Watching \\"The English Patient\\" was like opening a jar of caviar only to find a swarm of ants embedded in a carmelized lump of corn syrup... I hated it!<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes portrays an English pilot who becomes disfigured while flying a burning biplane over the Sahara. World War II is in its infancy, but that's just a moot point, since this film has very little historical legitimacy, anyway. In a series of flashbacks, we see the events leading up to that point in time. Once the flashback sequence ends, we return to present time, and after a few years, oh by the way, the war ends.<br /><br />By that time, it's hard to care what happens, because it's all so implausible. None of the characters portrayed in the film remotely resemble human beings, at least in the way they react to given situations. Each seems about as two dimensional as the life-size cardboard silouhettes of movie stars you'll see in the lobbies of theatres from time to time.<br /><br />Much of the story line seems to be rather arbitrary; The only apparent reason that some sequences in the movie take place is so that the running time of the film will be longer. You have subplots that go nowhere and add nothing to the story, minor characters who appear and disappear for no apparent purpose. Any meaning underlying this film is obscurred by a runaway script. With the screenplay out of control, the film seems to revel in its own awfulness.<br /><br />I watched \\"The English Patient\\" all the way through and the only feeling that I had afterward was that I had just thrown away three hours of my life.  For another review of this movie, see \\"Elaine Benes says it all\\", January 10, 2004 Reviewer: schtinkyfrom Bakersfield, CA USA
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I really love this Christmas CD.  It lets me know that Whitney is still in the game, and she's coming back.  She may not sound exactly like she use to, but she still got it.  This is the best CD she's came with lately.  And if she continues on like this, she will get back to where she use to be.  True Greatness Can Never Die..................
0446677450|5.0|Folks, the fact that Rich Dad Poor Dad is still among the top 20 best selling books (as recorded by competent sources) I belive is proof that this book rocks. <br /> <br />But the key is you have to read it. You can't just buy it and throw it on the shelf, you have to read it and then apply it. <br /> <br />Regarding the goof that made the wise cracks about Quickstar/Amway, this is getting a little old. If you tried and failed in Amway or some other MLM/NETWORK MARKETING Program, get over it. You obviously didn't  have what it takes. STICK TO BEING A INTERNET JUNKIE and SELF PUBLISHING ala hype via Amazon. <br /> <br />Network marketing is legal in every state and over 72 countries. It is for everybody but not everybody is for MLM. No problem, just find something else. <br /> <br />I found that working for an ungrateful employer wasn't for me so I moved on. I don't go bashing that company. Besides, I am far happier and making far more money now than I ever did working for someone else. <br /> <br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is not just about MLM, KIyosaki also suggests other businesses and opportunities as well. The most important thing is to absorb the mental aspects of what Kiyosaki teaches. It can change your life. <br /> <br />Certaintly better than following advice by non financial experts like JBQ, working for a unappreciative employer and then trying to retire on social (in) security (at a 40% cut in pay, if it still around) and a pension (which averages $88/wk if your company doesn't 86 your company penion plan--they are NOT guaranteed) <br /> <br />Thank you RTK. You are a lifesaver. <br />
B00005PJ8O|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. George C Scott is just excellent in the role of Patton, and he is backed up by and all-star cast playing the roles of other famous figures including Karl Malden as General Bradley...just an excellent job! The historical accuracy of the movie leaves a bit to be desired at time, but overall it does justice to the WWII experiences of one of the most legendary figures in American history! Check it out!
B0002XVQNU|1.0|I agree with J.Hall. That is just ridiculous. Maybe they expect people to buy both (theatrical and directors cut) to have the full movie and all the goodies. Not gonna happen (for me anyways)
B0002ZTBRQ|3.0|A boy blinded by toxic waste becomes endowed with sonar-like abilities and the wonderfull gift to defy gravity.<BR>Yes its a super hero movie that shamelessly apes Tim Burtons Batman and Raimis Spider-Man.<BR>Daredevil has allways been to me Marvels answer to Batman which isnt bad just obvious so it becomes a matter of preference which hero you like better and since Batman has gone through so many makeovers whilst DD has stayed allmost the same over the years im more likely to side with DareDevil.<BR>The movie looks and feels like a comic book but is brave and flawed all the same.<BR>I dont like Ben Afflec or Jennifer Garner or Micheal Clark Duncan or that idiot who played Bullseye so Daredevil should have been the worst movie ive ever seen but it wasnt.<BR>The above actors chew scenery here like termites on freshly cut oak but despite the uneven pacing and unlikely choice of actors it serves as a culty bit of goodness that I enjoyed watching.<BR>Enter the directors cut a much longer Daredevil with a tad more violence but the big difference is the subplot of a murdered prostitute and the man accused of killing her(Coolio?!?) who Matt Murdock(DD)is convinced didnt do it.Sadly this bit does make the movie drag a little more and it really doesnt work once the crime is solved towards the end of the film.<BR>All in all Daredevil is a noble attempt to give the devil his due and Marvel has done worse lately dont even get me started on The 2nd failed Punisher adaptation so enter with an open mind and lowered expectations and you should be all right.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Say what you will about Britney- she can put out an entertaining pop CD. Her peers Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson are both better singers (especially Christina) but tend to make albums that aren't perfect. This album is perfect. Or as close as you can get to perfection in modern pop music.  <br /> <br />This album is considered by many to be a new beginning for Britney. But that's not entirely true. Britney's fourth album \\"In the Zone\\" is really where she shifts direction. In this one, you can hear hints of the direction she will be going, but anyone who enjoyed her first two CDs will find nothing alienating on this one. Likewise, those hoping for a drastic departure will find nothing radically different on this one. But what does it matter when the music sounds this good? <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying there is nothing on this CD as immediately infectious and wonderful as \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\" or \\"...Baby, One More Time.\\" But whereas her first two albums had some good songs, and some filler, this album is good from start to finish. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" was the first single from this album and was produced by the Neptunes. At first, this song may not seem like it's Britney's style, which may be why people got the idea that Britney had made a transformation with this album. But after a few listens, it really grows on you. The second track, \\"Overprotected\\" was from her movie Crossroads. This is the Britney we remember from the first two albums, and you won't be able to get this one out of your head. \\"Lonely\\" could be a hit coming from most pop artists, but Britney had better material ahead on this album. \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" is another song everybody knows, fully worth listening to. Britney's vocals aren't always her strong spot on song's like this, but she pulls it off. \\"Boys\\" is another Neptunes produced track and is even better than the first one. \\"Anticipating\\" is a song Britney cowrote and a fine one. \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is another cover of a classic rock song from Britney. While I wish she would keep away from the classics, this isn't nearly as bad as her butchering of the Rolling Stone's classic \\"Satisfaction\\" on her last CD. In fact, while certainly not as good as the original, Britney's version of \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is still pretty catchy and fun. \\"Cinderella\\" is another song Britney cowrote with Max Martin, the mastermind behind many of her past hits. This is a definite winner, and one of my favorites on the album. I could go on to mention the remaining tracks and point out that I like them, but there's no point in citing each one specifically when that's about all I have to say for them.  <br /> <br />All that matters is that this is a great pop album. You can easily listen to this in a sitting, and you don't get sick of it as quickly as you do with many of the other pop CDs on the market. It ranks with Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" as the best of the modern pop genre. If you are bothered by the fact that Britney can be trashy, try putting that aside and listening to this CD for what it is. Pop is only meant to make you want to dance, or sing along and this CD accomplishes it's only goal beautifully. Don't miss it.
B00000FCBC|5.0|I too am not a fan of lica's new stuff (even black wasn't great) but this (especially disc 2) is pure greatness. You really need to hear both discs a few times to get into it, and also hear the original.  <br /> <br />From sabbath's sabbra cadabra (and riffs from national acrobat) to blitzkrieg, tallica showed they still had rock left (even though some were recorded in the 80's).  <br /> <br />There are great riffs in it from kirk, and great drums as well, and james still actually has a voice in this! Disc one has a bit of his new style of singing, but makes up for it with making simply amazing covers.
B00006CXXU|5.0|If you are a fan of pop music, go out and buy this CD without second thoughts because this is the best one there is. When Christina Aguilera first appeared in the late 90's, many people thought she was just Britney #2. While that was NEVER true, her debut also never hinted at just how truly talented and amazing Christina is. Her first CD was a pretty good pop CD, but not on par with some of Britney's work (though she was always the better singer). Then along came \\"Stripped\\" and it was more than just a CD. In the introduction, Christina promises us she will break the mold. And she does. The album is too long for me to review each individual track, but here are some highlights: <br /> <br />\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is one of the album's singles, and is about double standards. It also features a guest spot from L'il Kim. (4/5) <br /> <br />\\"Fighter\\" - A rock song, and another single. VERY CATCHY! (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Beautiful\\" - The best song on the album, and one of the best songs I've heard. It will always be underrated. (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Cruz\\" - Another great song, this one wasn't a single. It's worth the price of the album for this song alone. (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"Soar\\" - A gospel-like number, very interesting and nice to hear Christina do something different. (4/5) <br /> <br />\\"The Voice Within\\" - Very powerful. (5/5) <br /> <br />\\"I'm Okay\\" - You can hear Christina crying as she sings in this track. This song is about her father's abuse on both her and her mother. This song proves just how talented and strong she is. (5/5) <br /> <br />The only other pop CD out there that comes close to matching this one is Britney's self-titled album but where that one is just straight-forward pop music and nothing more, this is almost artistic. This vocals are outstanding, the lyrics are often heartfelt and compelling. In fact, the only conceivable flaw of this album is that it's a little long. But if you were to fix that, what tracks could you have omitted? Each contributes to the feeling, and mood of this masterpiece. And if you haven't experienced this yet, don't you think it's time? <br /> <br />
B00004SWBD|1.0|First of all, i would give SlipKnoT clean no stars if i could. You guys are all posers, you get edited Slipknot? The albums dosen't even make sense if it is edited. The real version of Slipknot self-titled is the Parental Advisory one. The people who bought this are posers and they should listen to more appropriate bands like, Yellowcard, and Maroon 5.
B00018D44U|4.0|I think that the reason that many people have mixed feelings about Norah Jones's albums are that she is so different and her voice is almost like an acquired taste.  While FEELS LIKE HOME isn't as goos as say 2002's masterpiece, COME AWAY WITH ME,  it is a very strong album.  My top song picks are \\"SUNRISE\\", \\"WHAT AM I TO YOU\\", \\"THOSE SWEET WORDS\\", \\"BE HERE TO LOVE ME\\", among other good hits with a mix of jazz, folk, and country. It isn't the most exciting album as say a pop, rock, or R&B album would be, but it certainly has an eclectic sense to it and it is a strong album.  I highly recommend FEELS LIKE HOME to anybody.  Good job again NORAH!!!!
B000002UUX|5.0|This album was the end of an era. The megadeth era. After this album megadeth went commercial and sold out. This album is pure genious. If you haven't heard megadeth before start with this album. Warning: make sure you get the original recording (9 songs)and not the re-issue(13 songs).
B0002IU988|2.0|While you can still see that ALTER BRIDGE has the same passion that CREED had, there is always going to be the comparison between CREED and ALTER BRIDGE.  Surely Myles Kennedy knew that when he was put into Scott Stapp's position, he knew he would always be compared to Stapp.  With that said, Kennedy really is a good vocalist, despite what many loyal Creed fans might say.  I think the problem with this album is that you have the original CREED members and a new vocalists and they haven't well differentiated themselves from being CREED.  They are no longer CREED but ALTER BRIDGE.  Musically, this album, which is clearly a hard-rock outfit, may be just a little bit \\"too hard\\". Compared to better rock albums of 2004, this one falls short. Compare it to VELVET REVOLVER  or U2 and you will see a clear difference.  I believe a big problem is that this album is too guitar heavy.  Had there been a little less guitar and more balance in general, it would have been easier to listen.  I do appreciate the passion and energy, something that made CREED unique.  Songs picks for me are 2:  \\"Find The Real\\" and \\"OPEN YOUR EYES\\", which is my top pick for the album. Alter Bridge has work to do to compare to better rock acts of the 00s.  The sales evidence this. CREED had better debut weeks and better sales track records than ALTER BRIDGE has had. 2 stars.
B0001A79JO|1.0|After listening to the horriblepops for about 30 seconds, I now feel the need to purge my brain.  Their music is like a commercial plaque coating the inside of my skull.  Help me.   I give them one star because they try so very very hard.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2's HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is a solid rock and roll album. It is amazing that U2 has been together as long as they have and this album doesn't show the group getting any older.  This album shows that U2 is still very capable of producing fresh rock and roll albums.  While this album doesn't feature much innovation where rock and roll music is concerned, it is a  pleasent listen nonetheless. One thing that is certainly fun about HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is how unpredictable some of the phrasings of the lyrics are. Where you think one full stanza of lyrics will go together there may be a big break in between.  My top picks are \\"VERTIGO\\", \\"MIRACLE DRUG\\",\\"LOVE AND PEACE OR ELSE\\", \\"CITY OF BLIND LIGHTS\\", just to name a few. The arrangements are all well put together and the piano/synthesizers occasionally included in some of the arrangments are very effective. Examining musically, as a musician myself, there is a lot that you can take away from U2 such as the professionalism of their albums, songwriting capabilities, and their musicianship.  Well Done. 4 stars.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Team america is an organization that protects the world from terrorism <br />There is alot of offensive language, offensive cultural stereotypes, offensive S*X scenes, offensive violence <br /> <br />but when we see the movie and we know the satire, WE appreciate it and we laugh our heads off! <br /> <br />We tend to forget that there are strings attached to the puppets but when we see them, we don't really care, we see blood, we see sex, we see racism. but we love it in an evil way <br /> <br />I love Kim Jong Il's voice and character. Its just so funny. Everyhting is basically humorous. <br /> <br />don't be offended by the movie. its just for fun. Though.. I had a friend who was mentally disturbbed and didn't talk to anyone of us after the movie ( he's a bit crazy) <br />but thats just him, but my other friends loved it. <br /> <br />Great puppets, amazing special effects, gross amount of language, funny........ <br /> <br />recommend. its somthing you don't see everyday! <br />DO NOT LET CHILDREN ENTER AND SEE THE MOVIE! ALONE OR SUPERVISED!. <br />if they do see it, they will be asking questions that you will not want to answer in their face......
6304493681|5.0|Please let me begin by saying.. that just because it is animation, does not automatically make it a film for children.<br /><br />I DO LOVE THIS FILM. Years after it's release, I still find enjoyment in watching it.<br /><br />This is a visually exciting, dream of a movie that brings the viewer into a world that does not exist .. as of yet. It is not about the 'psycho-babble' as one reviewer called it, or conveying ideas that are meant to re-shape the World. It is a beautiful and entertaining piece of work... illustrated to the finest degree.<br /><br />Some things should not be over analyzed. I know it's in our nature to take things apart and see how they work, and what is in the depth of them.. but sometimes you have take things for what they are. In this case, it's art, animated, telling a story, for entertainment.<br /><br />Sure there are ideas that are brought up, but mainly they are to help convey the meaning of what is happening. These 'Ghost' stories take place in a future world. It is really not that far off.. if you do your research. Like I said though.. sit back, be entertained..and aspire to your own greatness. Let this be a moment of relaxation and stimulation that you can watch and analyze later. Enjoy it. Chill out!
B0006284JQ|5.0|It is amazing to see britney transform into a young innocent girl into a [...]image full of scandal. <br />and we see this in her music too. <br /> <br />however, this might be a negative but interms in music, we accept the changes and its actually really cool! <br /> <br />The music is just fantastic and pop. Its lively, you can dance to it. lots of beat. with both ballads and dance songs <br /> <br />The reason why this is such a good album is because we have all her no.1s PLus an awesome unreleased track. when we say number one, we mean the best!!!! so its nice to listen to her greatest simgles that have earnt her millions! <br /> <br />Here is my list of tracks and my ratings: ( Aust. edition.. some countries may vary tracks) <br /> <br />1. My rerogative *** <br />2. Toxic: ***** <br />3. Im a slave 4 u: **** <br />4. Oops!...I did it again: ***** <br />5. Me against the music ***** <br />6. Stronger: ***** <br />7.

It includes some of britney's no. 1s its amazing how he strung them into one and made them perfect without any odd changes. <br /> <br />here is an important note: THE REASON WHY PEOPLE DON\\"T LIKE BRITNEY IS BECAUSE OF HER IMAGE! I KNOW SHE IS BECOMING A TART AND A SICKO. BUT ITS ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC! don't let image destroy music! Music is about hearing, not about image... so when you have the trouble of buying this album, just think about the music! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Let me tell you how I first learned of Gavin Degraw. First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Maroon 5. I saw them at the House Of Blues in Las Vegas... and Gavin Degraw opened for them. I had never heard of him, and I didn't even know that he was the singer of the \\"One Tree Hill Song\\" as everyone calls it.<br /><br />Let Me Tell You.. THIS GUY CAN ROCK! It was one of the best LIVE performances I had ever seen. He can play Piano, Jam on the Guitar..and wail like Elton John when he was a young pup. THIS KID IS TALENTED!!!<br /><br />My only dissapointment with the ALBUM 'CHARIOT' was that it was no-where as energetic as teh LIVE performance was, but it's really no dissapointment at all becuase I love the album.<br /><br />My Wish: Let them release a live recording of one of his shows. SO GOOD!
B000002X4T|5.0|`Holy Counterculture, Batman', what is the world coming to?' The Rolling Stones started it all when they lent one of their songs to sell Windows '95. Now Mick is shilling for digital cameras. Songs by Pete Townsend and The Who have been selling allergy medicine and have fronted every CSI show from coast to coast. Not that this is all bad. Half the reason I watch CSI is the jolt of adrenaline I get from their opening themes performed by The Who.<br /><br />But now, who of all people but the Jefferson Airplane is lending one its songs to ads for a STOCK TRADING company, of all things. And, not only is it just any old Jefferson Airplane song, it's `Volunteers of America', the closest thing there is to being an anthem for the counter culture in 1969, when it first appeared on the `Volunteers' album. To the sponsor, E*Trade's credit, they use the song in a very imaginative way, playing exactly on the fact that the song is literally a suggestion for revolution. Of course, like the Beatle's `Revolution', there is just a little artistic license here, as the song is more exactly a reflection of `60s attitudes than it is a literal call to the barricades.<br /><br />As a long time Jefferson Airplane fan, and a person who literally did exactly what the `Airplane' suggests in the song `The Farm' for a short time, E*Trade's appropriation of this most sacred of texts from that most sacred of decades comes as a major surprise. I just hope Gracie and Paul and Martie and Jorma and Headband Jack and the rest of the `Airplane crew are getting paid very, very well for their selling off this piece of my heritage to Wall Street.<br /><br />To get to the point of reading what is supposed to be a review, let me say that while `Volunteers' may represent the high water mark of American artistic aversion to the Vietnam war and what it was doing to this country, it is probably not their best album. Their most important work that established them as THE San Francisco psychedelic band was `Surrealistic Pillow'. Their fullest work, with the greatest number of original songs is `Crown of Creation'. The album which I really believe is the most fun is the live recording `Bless It's Pointed Little Head'. But, `Volunteers' is the very last real `Airplane album before Gracie and Paul did their `Blows Against the Empire' project billing the band as the `Jefferson Starship', all based on a SciFi classic by Robert A. Heinlein. Explaining the irony of Heinlein quoted by the `Airplane is just too deep to go into here.<br /><br />After `Blows...' I believe the band became much less interesting for a very long time. This may have been due to the alienation of Marty Balin and the spin-off of Jorma and Jack to the blues group Hot Tuna. So, this is the last of the truly great `Airplane albums, the apotheoses of the counterculture reaction to the very unpopular war. Aside from `Volunteers' itself, there are two other classic anti-war / anti-establishment songs in `We Can Be Together' by Paul Kantner and the great `Wooden Ships' by Kantner, David Crosby, and Stephen Stills which also appears as the first cut on the second side of the Crosby, Stills, and Nash debut album. Grace contributes the song `Eskimo Blue Day' which stylistically previews the themes of `Blows Against the Empire'. Jorma contributes three works, two of which are arrangements of traditional tunes and one original, `Good Shepherd'. Drummer Spencer Dryden contributes the country and western novelty `A Song for All Seasons'.<br /><br />With all this anarchy, its curious that the very little `bad language' is so badly mumbled that you can hardly know what they are saying, and, in the copy of the lyrics in the LP, these words are changed to something much less objectionable. I thing Frank Zappa actually called them out on the timidity of hedging their bets with these dodges.<br /><br />All in all, this is still an extremely powerful album that still resonates over the last thirty-five years. If you really want to know about music in the `60s counterculture, trade in your Grateful Dead for this classic.eally want to know about music in the `60s counterculture, trade in your Grateful Dead for this classic. <br />
0395389496|5.0|Is there a Santa?  Is there a polar express?  Is there a golden rule in the theme?  What does the story mean to your children?  These are questions that we discussed at our mom/child book club right after we read The Polar Express.  Meeting once a month provides us with incredible opportunities to read many amazing books such as this one.  We then have one person who comes up with questions about the book that everyone else discusses with their child and bestows enlightening answers on the group.  We then switch and a new mom/child assumes the role in leadership for the next book.  I would have to say that this book has been a favorite of ours for some time now as it shares many real life examples:  Giving is better than receiving.  Believing is a powerful force, Santa can be in your heart through his spirit all year long, etc.  There's many lovely books to share with your family.  We keep this one out as a dedicated \\"family book.\\"  We have a basket on our coffee table, it contains our favorite books for the kids and for me, an avid reader.<br /><br />While my two sons are expressing their delight in the wonderful artwork and telling the story of the well-read book to each other in their own words, I am reading some of my own.  We have a reading time each day for thirty minutes.  It's a quiet time where we sit around the couch and read silently for half and an outloud time for the other.<br /><br />Even though this is a semi-quiet time, I know that sooner or later, the kids will begin displaying their normal silly and loud outbursts but it's a magical moment right now.  I have some of my own parenting/family books that I would like to recommend to other moms, if you have kids ages 2 to 14, Mommy CEO and 123 Magic are two family books which can help in real life challenges and make excellent gifts all during the year.<br /><br />As we all sit reading our favorite books, I can hear my kids making hushed sounds of a Polar Express engine and I love this shared family tradition -- reading time.family tradition -- reading time.
B00005AQE8|4.0|All Eyez On Me is certainly worth of all the praise and record sales it has amassed(well over 10 million, thank you very much), but to say this is his best album is blasphemous; that honor belongs to Me Against The World. Though his signing to the hip hop dynasty Deathrow records was a stroke of briliance of the part of Suge Knight, it ultimately corrupted him from his natrual self; on Me Against The World, he was a troubled and eloquent street scholar trying to make it another day, but now the accesses of life have truly consumed him. Nevertheless, this a truly memorable album; Deathrow's current stars(Dr. Dre, That Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, Danny Boy) make his step his game up and the results are eartshattering. How many classics are on this album? California Love(which samples EPMD's \\"Knick Knack Patty Wack\\" and Zapp's \\"Computer Love\\")? How Do U Want It(with K-Ci and Jo-Jo of Jodeci)? 2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted(featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg).? Even the lesser songs are hot; All About You, Rather Be Ya Nigga, Go My Mind Made Up(HOT posse joint featuring Tha Dogg Pound, Method Man and Redman). This is one albunm for the books; go get it if you alredy don't. R.I.P, Mr. Shakur.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I was completely blown away by this movie!  What an utter surprise....  It has a fantastic story and is very thought provoking.  Superb cast!  It was extremely interesting to me, although it is not mainstream and may not be to everyone.  I noticed many people have given away the story in their reviews on here, but I am not going to do that!  I will just say you will not be wasting time nor money on this one!  :-)  Enjoy!
B000002PCS|5.0|These songs are the best, I was not born yet when the film frist came out. But once I watched this movie, I started loving every single part of it. The soundtrack is excellent. Nothing could be compared with this beautiful melody at the present time. The music is classical and beautiful,it is also modern in a sense, such a nice piece of work that could really last for century, it has a very strong feeling in it. You will love it. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie totally rocks!  Everyone should see this movie and those that don't laugh should be weeded out of society.  We can then place all of those people that have no sense of humor on some remote island.....to live out their un-funny days together. ;-)  This is one of the funniest movies of our time.  AWESOME and worth every dime you pay.  You will not be disappointed
B00006AW2G|5.0|The \\"Glimmer Twins\\" weren't the best songwriters in rock-Lennon and McCartney were-but they were the most consistent and the Rolling Stones were the most rock-and-roll band in the world for at least a quarter of a century. They have a rough, rolling rhythm that's still unequaled, with Keith Richards' open-tuned Tele riffs working off and driving Charlie and Bill;there's a level of interplay with the beat found nowhere else in rock.  <br /> <br /> Like Jimi Hendrix, the Stones' music has held up with both mainstream rock and roll fans of two generations and the bicoastal/art/glamour/gay/trendy crowd, here and in about every country with any audience for rock music. <br /> <br /> Let It Bleed is the Rolling Stones' transition album: Brian Jones (originally he, not Mick Jagger, was the leader of the band) was fired and then died, Ry Cooder-now bitter and hateful of the Stones over perceived exploitation despite their having made him known-filling in and lending slide guitar that would make this a cornerstone of the slide guitar portfolio. The songs are raw, driving, yet musical: rebellious yet offering an extended hand to the sufferer. Along with Beggar's Banquet, this is the high point of the Stones' career, the Mick Taylor years. Taylor would leave a couple years later, to be replaced by Ronnie Wood-who has been a Rolling Stone for many more years than Taylor and Jones put together-who was far more Stonesish but nowhere the guitarist.
B000062YAZ|1.0|normally I don't review things but I will in exception here. Alot of Slayer talk has been tied in here with Children of Bodom, Metallica, and Linkin Park. <br /> <br />What the hell kids? Metallica is a whole different world from slayer...a MUCH better world. Linkin Park is an entire different genre that doesn't belong in any conversation with metal. And yes Slayer paved the way for bands like Children of Bodom...and sadly we have to live with bands like COB. <br /> <br />you can listen to good hard metal without having to listen to slayers bs. Listen to Metallica, Megadeth, Dream Theater, Iced Earth, Deamons and Wizards. Want to hear a band that plays music 4 times the speed of slayer and plays it better?...DragonForce. ALL OF THESE BANDS CAN BE FOUND ON THIS SITE!!! LOOK EM UP! <br /> <br />O yeah and this album...same song over and over...same boring lame song over and over...the drums are the death of this album.

B00007BH5C|5.0|I don't have this cd (i download) but my favorite song would have to be 'The Hornburg'.  That song is so incredibly epic, you feel like you are in Aragorn's shoes!  And as one other said, 'Gollum's song' is pretty good too. The reason i put 'second' most epic cd is because 'The Return of the King' soundtrack is probably the best out of all three.&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; i definitely give this 5 out of 5 stars.  GREAT music for the whole family.&#60;br /&#62;
B00005JMAH|4.0|Almost everytime I heard people talk about this movie they've said that it doesn't follow the book and its doesn't have any quiditch in it.  The truth is that there is quiditch in it, its just that as any Harry Potter fan would know the match didn't finish because of something they didn't expect. And as for following the book, I think it follows close enough to enjoy the movie.The only part that didn't follow the book was the the end witch belonged in the middle.  The reason I give it a four is because there are a few parts where they fail to make the adiance understand whats going on and the only people who would are the people who's read the book.

B0006399FS|4.0|Its not bad album but not so good as well. There is something missing somewhere in this Album. I have listened all the U2 album and Achtung baby was my best U2 album. Some of the songs in this album sounds like old track as well. I even pre-ordered this album. The bottom line is, this is below what I have expected. Thanks.
0451207521|3.0|In some ways this book reminded me of the way a woman rights fiction, and with the risk of sounding misogynistic  (which I'm not), I just personally think men are better writers of fiction.  Of course, unless a woman ghost wrote this book, it was written by a man, but the problems it has, in my opinion, are some of the same types I have found in reading novels by women.<br /><br />Too much telling instead of showing, too much detail about stuff I didn't care about, characters too much to type, not enough powerfully written action, too much touchy-feelie type interaction written in a way that just misses the mark and maybe the worst problem, a protagonist that could have been so much more and failed to be really engaging (she lacked the ability to get me to empathize with her, feel her emotions or really root for her).  Perhaps it is a very difficult task for a man to write a novel with a woman in the lead, and while I think maybe if Follet had been able to write this in the first person (at least the parts of the story from her pov) it might have made it a stronger story.<br /><br />In any case, it is a decent action novel set in occupied France just before the invasion, so any that enjoy fiction set in that period will probably enjoy the book.
B000065PUE|5.0|The Pixies come off as a hard punkish, surf rock band, that just enjoys what they do. A long time ago after first listening to The Pixies, \\"Debaser\\", I couldn't help but repeatedly listen to it for about 2 months. Finally I bought their 2 cds \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and of course \\"Doolittle\\". After hearing these full lengths quickly they became my favourite band and still are. This band is an addiction, they get your attention and hold on to it will their catchy riffs and awesome lyrics. The hard stuff will really make you want to rock, and their softer jam stuff makes you want to sing every word. I would easily buying this album and all of the other Pixies albums because this is the greatest rock band of all time. They started a revolution which has evolved to create the sounds you hear from most early 90's indie bands as well as some today. Seeing these guys live in their newest tour is amazing as well. Everything about them is good, buy their cds it will make you happy trust me. -Shane Pedersen
B000035P7X|4.0|I'd give this documentary a solid B. There is some fantastic footage, great clips of Dylan writing and playing music, and interesting dialogue between him and Joan Baez. However, at times it is very hard to understand what the people in the documentary are saying. It is also incredibly frustrating to see Bob Dylan being such a jackass to the majority of people that he encounters throughout this film. I don't believe that this is necessarily a fair portrayal of the person he actually is- but maybe that's just me being naieve. He is opinionated, and animated, and this is surely evident in this film. I saw Bob Dylan recently in concert, and it's great to see what he once sounded and acted like live in the mid 60's, for better or worse. Recommended for \\"patient\\" Dylan fans.

B00003CXA2|1.0|Why do people love this movie?  Because it is about a guy who, despite being absolutely clueless about all of the history of our country for the past 40 years, manages to sail through all of that history with the aid of a few simple homilies.  I guess people find it very comforting to know that they don't really have to try to understand the complexities of the world around them, because everything will turn out ok anyway.<br /><br />This movie made me absolutely squirm in my seat when I saw it in the theatre.  I found it completely excruciating.<br /><br />But people love it.  I gues that is why this country just re-elected Forrest Gump, I mean George Bush, as President.  And because people think they are voting for simple moral values, and don't really want to understand what is going on, their social security is going to get privatized, their health care is being taken away, interest rates are going up, the dollar is going down, the land is getting raped, the rich are getting richer, and everyone else is getting screwed.  Wake up, people!  This is a dangerous movie.  It is meant to make you complacent while the forces of evil take over.  Stay away!
B00003CX5P|3.0|I hadnt seen this movie in the theater and bought the Wide Screen DVD instead. Much of the visual portions of the movie were very stunning but I wish that Lucas wouldnt put in such silly races in his movies. I guess he has to find something cuddly and likeable to make up for all of the dark forces in the flick. <br /> <br />In answer to one critic - the Ben Hur chariot race was from a different era and the race scene in this movie was a waste of footage as it would have been better to have spent more time developing relationships than how a character can win by flying a pod. The Ben-Hur race is by far more exciting and has MUCH more drama behind it. These days you can pump this kind of stuff out pretty much any time you like. Try finding someone like Steven Boyd and Charleton Heston to give you good acting! <br /> <br />Kids in Star Wars movies dont excite me. I would have preferred that less attention be shown on the kid and more on what was going on in the other side of the hill (bad guys) like they did in the original movies. <br /> <br />The acting by the ladies was well done. Some of the lines for Obi-Wan seemed out of place. Alec Guiness gives you the idea that he was less impulsive than his younger character portrays in this movie. <br /> <br />All in all I liked the movie and tried not to compare it to the other movies. I found myself interested in it as long as the flapper ears wasnt droning on and on to the other characters. <br /> <br />It was more of a comedy to me than a serious work but I guess that Lucas was trying to interject something to replace Skywalker, the Princess and of course the scoundrel Han Solo. <br /> <br />And Star Wars as a whole will never keep me coming back to watch it as well as Lord of the Rings does. It has everything to do with acting and very little to do with special effects.

B000001AJG|5.0|I was first introduced to Stevie Wonder's \\"Secret Life of Plants\\" through a dance performance at Binghamton University in upstate New York. <br />It lends itself to interpretation. Lots of wide open music and languid melodies. <br />I think this could be a great orchestral work. Some of the recording bears the burden of that early digital harshness...but the melodies are so gentle. <br />I bought this album used after I saw the dance performance. Listened to it once or twice. <br />Now I'm converting my favorite vinyl to digital. Some music doesn't stand the test of time. <br />This music does. <br />After converting it, Ive listened to it three or four times. And I plan to buy a copy for my sister. <br />Like a good novel, this album is most rewarding if you have the time to go all the way through it in one sitting. <br />But certain parts replay in my head and invite listening to specific songs. <br />
0380789035|5.0|A friend at work suggested this book as I have read the Sandman collection. This book is perfect.  I couldn't stop reading it although did guess right about the lake. It wasn't a book with a catch which made the story even more beautiful, until I realized at the end there was one, much like Fight Club, the writer allows the story to tell itself, not relying on tactics used by so many authors.  The story of Shadow entralled me. His name actually has a point to it, unlike so many other authors who used that name for a character  Unlike Sandman which conveyed it's message with pictures and art work and brilliant storytelling  (see the kindly ones and Dreams face when he makes his fateful decision)American Gods used it's symbolic energy and tour of American countryside as way of taking a physical and spiritual journey which showed fantasy as a realistic portrayel of life.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I was excited when I first heard that Shania was putting out a Greatest Hits CD and that there would be 3 new songs on it. After listening to it, I totally love the new songs, especially \\"Don't.\\" I also love \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" with it's bluegrass feel and it takes me back to Shania's early days. If the new material on this album is any indication of what's to come in the future from Shania, I can't wait.
0393317552|5.0|This book isn't the easiest read in the world but it's worth the effort.   <br /> <br />Jared Diamond has the very unmodern chutzpah required to \\"take on\\" the grand sweep of history.  He is trying to get to the root of what \\"complex society\\" depends on which explains why societies evolved differently.  His ideas are persuasive and better yet based on simple provable/disprovable facts.   <br /> <br />I'm not enough of an expert on history/biology/geology/etc. to furnish arguments for or against his ideas so see what others have said.  I can only say \\"wow\\" to what he is trying to accomplish here.  If I had one critique it would be that this book could use a little editing.  It tends to go off on tangents but even the detours are fascinating forays into the orgins of everything.
B000005S6B|5.0|The Bosstones, Dropkick Murphys, Black 47, Flogging Molly, and countless other bands since have been influenced by the madness of The Pogues. The lead singer Shane MacGowan's notorious reputation for drinking and drug use and actually making it through a set has overshadowed the musicians, who are as confrontational as any punk rock band. I'd put this up against London Calling and Joshua Tree (U2's producer also worked on this one) easily because it still sounds as fresh as it did over 15 years ago.   <br /> <br />The result is classic. It's got a great beat. The title track is a punk meets Celtic  explosion. Turkish Song of the Damned gives it a middle-eastern flavor. The \\"Fairytale of New York\\" is the most known off of this, with Kirsty MacColl duetting with Shane on one of the greatest Xmas songs ever written. Any song that starts off with \\"It was Xmas Eve babe, in the drunk tank\\" HAS to be good. But it's a catchy song that you will have a hard time getting out of your head for weeks. \\"Metropolis\\" is an instrumental, and \\"Fiesta\\" is an insane punk mariachi celtic clash. Irish coffee with tequila.  <br /> <br />The Medley and Worms are the more traditional songs but done Pogues style, and \\"Broad Majestic Shannon\\" round this one out.  <br /> <br />Not a bad song in the bunch. Not a dull moment, and this one competes with \\"Rum..\\"as greats.  <br /> <br />
0142004235|5.0|I grew up reading Steinbeck, and i love everything about him. His colourful landscapes, or the unique characters, and the poetic style of every novel. East of Eden ranks amongst the finest of Steinbeck's work, along with The grapes of Wrath and Of mice and men, but also the lesser known works which also astounded me, like To a god unknown. The length of this novel should not put anyone off, as it is an easy read that you won't want to put down. You'll end up wishing it was longer. This is a perfectly epic  construe of literature. It is also great to see the recent revival of interest in this book, and many others like it. It gives the choice of reading back to the reader. <br />This is a modern fable, and one that should last as long as the ones from the bible upon which Steinbeck constantly plays.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's self titled debut (1980) is not anywhere near matching the power of the 1982 masterpiece 'Number of the Beast,' but is a very strong album nonetheless. It is the only album to feature guitarist Dennis Stratton, and features bass work almost as good as the followup, 'Killers,' the better of the two Paul Di'Anno era records.<br /><br />Though the Paul Di'Anno era is far from their best times, it certainly kills the Blaze Bayley era by a longshot. The album features some songs that would lay the foundation for some of their future masterpieces-the twin guitar assault, the top-notch basslines, the insane vocals.<br /><br />And now, of course, the three major highlights of the album. \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is the epic of the album, with such an amazing (and lengthy) instrumental break, it will take your breath away. \\"Transylvania\\" is one of the greatest metal instrumental tracks of all time, almost as good as Metallica's \\"Call of Ktulu\\" and \\"Orion\\" numbers. And closer \\"Iron Maiden\\" is a short, fast, and somewhat simple way to say, \\"you're next on my list!\\" The lyrics, though they repeat themselves a total of three times through, tell all about this band, and the chorus goes a little something like this:<br /><br />\\"Oh well, wherever, wherever you are...<br /><br />Iron Maiden's GONNA GET YOU!...no matter how far.<br /><br />See the blood flow, watching it shed<br /><br />Up above my head...<br /><br />IRON MAIDEN WANTS YOU FOR DEAD!!!\\"<br /><br />Need I say more? For people looking for a good beginner's choice, this is perfect.<br /><br />\\"I'm comin' to get you!\\"-Iron Maiden
B0006284JQ|3.0|Oh please, put some clothes on, bee-yotch!!! If Britney wanted to do a remake of an 80's song, why choose that one? It is so closely associated with Bobby Brown that I doubt that anyone else could have a hit with it. And does she ALWAYS have to look like a hooker? But the music is what counts. The \\"new songs\\" offer nothing \\"new\\" at all. \\"Do Something\\" sounds like an \\"In the Zone\\" out take as does \\"I've Just Begun...\\". And to me it just shows how much better her first two albums were. Even pop music haters have to agree that \\"OOps\\" and \\"Baby Hit Me...\\" are classic pop songs. They also have great album cuts such as \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\". But this does have a decent bonus cd of remixes so it may be worth your money.
0385508417|2.0|What a stupid book. The idea of \\"skipping Christmas\\" is only remotely interesting (news flash - there are lots and lots of people who don't spend $7,000 on gifts, an expensive party, custom Christmas cards, and Christmas decorations every year!!)  Its poorly written for starters, and the main character is just pompous and mean and inspires no sympathy, who really cares if he skips Christmas? It reads like some creative writing assignment from a junior high schooler.  He obviously was hoping to cash in by writing this slapdash little story in about ten minutes and selling it to people for the price of a hardback. If you're a normal person who doesn't have a special stationery boutique that takes it upon themselves to phone you personally to design your Christmas cards (ever hear of Walmart?) then you will not relate to the characters in this book.
B00004Y6RO|2.0|This review is based entirely on the bonus material, i.e., 15-20. Make no mistake, I love the original, and while I realize it's widely hated, I don't care. Sometimes you're just in the mood for straight-forward anger, and that's, essentially, what Slipknot is all about.<br /><br />I bought this edition of the original simply because my old copy was extremely worn and this is the only one they had. Basically there's nothing new for the first 14 songs. Love those? Well they're still here in the same glory they were previously. However, my complaints fall on the rest of the CD. Aside from Get This (one of Slipknot's best), there's just no need for these \\"bonuses\\". And in no way is this version worth paying 3 dollars more.<br /><br />After the afformentioned great Get This, we have two remixes. Spit It Out (Hyper Version) is a just a little bit faster than the original, in fact if you weren't paying attention you wouldn't even realize it was a different version. Then we have Wait And Bleed (Terry Date Mix), which is nothing more than a watered down version that only contains singing, made entirely for radio-play. There's a live song, Surfacing, which aside from Cory giving the \\"New national anthem\\" prequel and some crowd noise, is nothing different from the original. Adding Eeyore was a nice treat though, another great song. Then there's two demos. Interloper isn't half bad for being a demo, but where the real trouble is is in Despise. Giving Purity a new name doesn't change the message, and singing doesn't add any depth. Part of the reason Purity is the best song Slipknot has ever made is because of Cory's intensity and delivery of the lyrics. Desacrating that song by releasing this travesty is demeaning, plain and simple.<br /><br />For the hardcore fan, by all means, pick this up. But for fans such as me, who just needed a new copy, don't waste 3 dollars getting this. Sure the packaging is better but having to hear 5 unneeded and unwanted songs tacked on at the end does nothing but ruin the flow of a great CD. A cheap attempt at a cash-in is all this is.e end does nothing but ruin the flow of a great CD. A cheap attempt at a cash-in is all this is.

Some of the best songs are \\"La Monture,\\" \\"Lune,\\" \\"Vivre\\", \\"Bohemienne\\" and \\"Danse mon Esmeralda.\\" I highly recommend it to any music fan or lover of the story of The Hunchback of Notre-Dome.
B000001EKX|5.0|This made #100 on the charts. Why? That's what I'd like to know. <br /> <br />Hotter Than Hell sounds like it was recorded in a garage. The sonics are dirty and the guitars are hot. There you are. <br /> <br />Got To Choose: Classic intro lick, very different melody. A great stop-start ending <br /> <br />Parasite: Grungy heavy metal guitar (very fat...no, not phat) from Ace Frehley. Yeah..... <br /> <br />Goin' Blind: \\"I'm 93, you're 16.\\" The most twisted love song ever. Full of raw emotion and bitter guitar. For a perverted song, it's pretty sad and romantic! <br /> <br />Hotter Than Hell: Criss does some fine drumming at the end, while Ace blows away the usual guitar. <br /> <br />Let Me Go, Rock & Roll: This was the first of many rock anthems. Though it would be overshadowed by Rock & Roll All Nite, it's a fine piece itself. <br /> <br />All The Way: 1-2-3-4 countdown like never before. Gene sings cool on this one. The chorus is perfect, the mood fun and energetic. Possibly the best song. <br /> <br />Watchin' You: Yet another great intro. Very metal song (for the day). Another classic. <br /> <br />Mainline: Peter's classic happy, but rockin' love song. Give it to me one time. <br /> <br />Comin' Home: Devilishly simple, this one is emotional, but also light. No naplam solos, but still good. <br /> <br />Strange Ways: Before dirty livin', this was Peter's cool, sleazy song. Add in phaser guitar and: Sweet Fancy Moses. <br /> <br />This is Hard ROCK, dig?
B00005JNEI|1.0|A movie only the French and the Hollywood Left could love, the maniacal ravings of a Bush-bashing, anti-American lunatic.  This crock-umentary is a spinfest of half-truths, distortions and outright lies.  Comrade Moore's fantasy audition for Minister of Propaganda in the Kerry Politburo.  Thank God the American people had enough sense to see this phony huckster for what he really is.
B00019PDKC|5.0|Anathema are (arguably) the pioneers of doom metal.  And for better or worse, like most doom bands, their current albums find them gravitating away from their origins and more toward the realm of alternative/trip rock.  Well, they do nothing to escape this trend with their latest album, A Natural Disaster, but perhaps that's not such a bad thing.  True, a couple of the songs can get a little boring, but this new sound Anathema has adopted can just as good as their older material at times. Are You There? and Balance are some of the best songs I've ever heard from them, and I own all their albums from CrestFallen up to this one.  It's very difficult to discern where this fits into the Anathema catalog quality wise.  There's really not a consensus on which album is best when it comes to them since every album is so different from the last.  Personally, I think The Silent Engima, A Fine Day To Exit, Eternity and Alternative 4 are better, but I'm sure there are quite a few who would disagree with me. I guess I'd just recommend listening to the sound samples and finding out which you like best since your not likely to get a definitive answer from looking at reviews.  In summary, this album isn't for everyone, if your looking for something to get drunk and mosh to, this isn't it.  Rather, this is more like what you'd relax to during the hangover after a night of moshing. So, if you enjoy doom music and don't mind if it's a bit on the mellow side, get this today and be prepared to be engulfed in the subtle gloomy textures and raw emotion that make up A Natural Disaster.
B000687M48|5.0|This was a very awesome rock show put on by Evanescence. It is taped Live in Paris at The Zenith. Evanescence performs all their songs off the Fallen album, with the exception of \\"Hello.\\" Overall, I give it a solid 5 stars. I couldn't find anything negative about it. Also included with the one hour live concert is their 4 music videos (going under, bring me to life, everybody's fool, my immortal) and an hr of behing the scenes footage. I deftinley recommend this to all rock fans!
0156029065|5.0|Umberto Eco returns with great success to the Middle Ages with a tale of a talented Italian peasant who becomes a favorite at the court of Frederick Barbarossa. Baudolino becomes the adopted son of the Emperor after helping him when lost and impressing him with his skill for languages, story telling, and prophecies. Baudolino attends school in Paris, participates in many military campaigns especially in his native Italy, and ultimately sets out on his own to discover the lost Christian empires of the Far East. Fortunately for us, he ends up in Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade sacking, and relates his life story to an emminent historian. Unfortunately for Baudolino and history, his story is so infused with outrageous lies that the historian decides to disbelieve it all.  <br /> <br />There are two very good stories here. The first is Baudolino's life long friendship and relationship with a group from his school days. They are a diverse group by nationality, religion, and occupation, and ultimately set out on a homeric journey to the East to link up with the fabled Prester John. Along the way and after, they become merchants and manufacturers of religious artifacts, unsurpassed counterfeiters, reluctant crusaders, diplomats, and persons of great influence in the court.  <br /> <br />The second story, probably less interesting, is the mystery surrounding the death of the emperor. There were many with motives and means to kill Frederick, and somehow the quest for the Holy Grail and other antiquities gets tied up with the murder.  <br /> <br />Eco has returned to the successful style and formula he employed in The Name of the Rose. By design, many of the characters are flat and one-dimensional, including one whose real name can not be rememebered, to focus more on the relationship between Baudolino, his women, and Frederick, and the historical context. A very clever literary device is employed, whereby Baudolino tells his story to a respected historian, who is familiar with some of the later events, while the two are engaged in hunkering down during the sack and then ultimately fleeing their common enemies.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Listen up all Republicans. As you might know Michael Moore made a movie in 2002 called Bowling for Columbine.  When it was released people found mistakes in that movie.  When Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11 two years later he hired people to check his facts and make sure nothing was wrong with it and there wasn't so don't buy FahrenHYPE 9/11 (which I have reviewed rating it only one star! Oh Yeah slap it high democrats)or Celcius 41.11 b/c they put more lies in there that I think anybody could.  Can't wait to see Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2 in 2007.
B0000009SG|5.0|Sometime music is popular because it's good.  Remember Thriller? Pop trash, yes, but great music, same here, only without the pop trash.  Great musicianship from Ponty, and George Duke at his peak.  Very tight without being over rehearsed and bland (it always amazed me how Zappa's bands were so tight without loosing freshness.  Interesting contrast to the one-take style of recording Dylan used to make those early recordings sound fresh). <br /> <br />I do not understand anyone that would write anything negative about Zappa's creativity.  Yes he was idealistic to the point of nausea, and yes his commercial shtick gets tiring, but his music is second to none.  Back in my early twenties when I thought Al Dimeola was the greatest guitarist I too thought Frank's guitar was second rate, but in the ensuing 20 years I've done my listening homework.  He is one of the most brilliant guitarists that ever lived.  I think people have trouble with his guitar playing because it is so original.  Listen a little closer, and if you're still not convinced watch the interview with Stevie Vai on the Entertainment Channel special on Franks life.  And if that doesn't convince you listen to the Yellow Shark album.  Hearing Franks music in a classical setting underscores the pure brilliance.   <br /> <br />The core band here was his best, and while we were disappointed with his move to the Ike Willis band of the late '70s and '80s it's clear now that he wanted to move to musicians that could play closer to what he really wanted rather than the improvisational fun of Duke and Murphy-Brock.  But I still prefer this band with the raw energy and wild improvisational style. <br /> <br />Thinking back to my introduction to Frank, this was the album that first grabbed me.  It's one of his most accessible albums, though some would say Joe's Garage is.  Joe's certainly is cleaner, but see above about the different bands.  The bottom line, if you are curious about Frank Zappa, get this album. <br />
B000002KDS|5.0|May be Alice Cooper did not notice the impact of this album in those times . But the essence of all his special magnetism never reached equal and even similar heights .<br />To my mind the best track of this CD and obviously the best song of Cooper ever is Halo of flies . This piece not only is hard to beat but besides inmensely original in its purpose . The riffs and the rhthym changes are so innovative that literally leaves you exhausted and breathtakin : harshness in its highest rank . I consider this piece as one the most sublime and best achievements in this first half decade and all the rock story .<br />You drive me nervous is an excellent piece ; If you want to be my lover is very funny and filled of stamine . I think seriously this album must have influenced a famous band : I'm talking about Kiss . Try to get this CD and compare by yourself.<br />The level difference between this album and School's out is so great that you will hard believe this band be the same . The fatal decay experienced for this quartet was one of the fastest in the music may be beated for the Mountain case ; that heavy rock band whose leader was Felix Pappalardi .  The inspiration loss was so deep and fast that literally became the beginning of the end for both ensambles .<br />Fortunately for Mountain band they acepted the crude reality and decided under mutual agreement to dissolve ; but this was not the case of Cooper who decided to follow the traces of Icarus !

6300214710|5.0|....even though I was only four years old at that time.  \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is a throwback to a whole other mindset that we have definitely lost nearly twenty years later.  What is it that we have lost?  In my opinion, in the films of today, we have lost a sense of innocence, we are no longer upbeat and it seems to me that many of the films pandered to teenagers and young twentysomethings are filled to the brim with cynicism and leave a sour taste in your mouth, once you have left the movie theatre.  I find myself saying, \\"Did I really pay $7.50 for this?!\\"<br /><br />What makes \\"Pretty in Pink\\" so good is the great cast.  This is truly Molly Ringwald at her finest, cast as a high school senior from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" who is pursuing a romance with a classmate with seemingly all of the breaks (Andrew McCarthy).  Her best friend, \\"Ducky,\\" is masterfully played by Jon Cryer.  Ducky, of course, is interested in her on more than just a friend level, and feels threatened when this new guy with money and popularity comes around to woo his best friend.  Ducky has a combination of unusual fashion sense (where did he get those shoes?!), he's got that wonderful combination of gawky teenage vulnerability and stand-up comedy timing to match.  The strong cast, along with a great 80s soundtrack that will take you back, great direction and a great plot that challenges us to think about whether your class standing truly determines who you can love in the end makes the film both entertaining and intelligent.  This film should be a pre-requisite for young filmmakers and 1980s film buffs alike.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I think I can safely say I have never met anyone who dislikes the film \\"Scarface.\\" Don't get me wrong; I am sure plenty of people out there would absolutely despise this profanity filled, hyperviolent exploration of the cocaine trafficking culture of the early 1980s, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time with them. Heck, are there people anywhere who HAVEN'T seen this film, other than my parents and grandparents? This has to be one of the best guy films ever made, and even more surprising, it holds up amazingly well with the passage of time. It's difficult in the extreme to imagine that twenty years have gone by since this first hit the silver screen. \\"Scarface\\" has lost none of its power to shock, not a bit of it. When I learned that a new DVD version recently hit the streets, I knew I had to check it out one more time. The last few times I saw the film, it looked really bad--dark, grainy, with muzzy audio quality. How could anyone let this masterpiece deteriorate? Well, thanks to the technical wizards we can once again watch Antonio Montana roll over everyone in his path in 5.1 Dolby (probably 6.1 DTS too) with a great picture transfer.<br /><br />You know already know what the movie is about, but let me practice my summarizing skills anyway. Flashback to the early 1980s and the Mariel boatlift, an incident involving a flood of Cubans entering this country after Castro lifted travel restrictions in that country. Unfortunately, Uncle Fidel also emptied his jails and sent the dregs of Cuban society to the shores of Florida. In the film, two of these newly arrived immigrants are Antonio Montana (Al Pacino) and Manny Ray (Steven Bauer), two thugs looking to get out of the tent cities fast. Anything is possible for two guys willing to kill for a buck, and when a couple of big shots on the outside offer Tony and Manny green cards if they off a communist official now living in the tents, both readily go along with the deal. Soon after both men join up with big time cocaine trafficker Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). It is at this point that Tony begins to fulfill his destiny: he meets his future wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), forms important connections with South American cocaine kingpin Sosa (Paul Shenar), and learns the ins and outs of distributing huge quantities of the white stuff. Problems that will later fell our anti-hero also pop up on the radar screen, namely Tony's insane preoccupation with protecting his little sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).<br /><br />Opportunity comes knocking when Frank, fearing that Tony is becoming powerful, makes the horrible mistake of trying to murder his underling. After the botched assassination attempt at a local club, Montana and his crew assume power the old fashioned way by killing Frank and his corrupt cop protector Mel (Harris Yulin). Sosa sees no problem welcoming Tony into the fold, and Tony sees no problem in moving huge consignments of narcotics. He soon buys a huge mansion, complete with his own personal zoo on the premises, and even forms his own financial company to help hide his illicit activities. Sadly, Tony quickly forgets a rule first told to him by Frank Lopez: don't get high on your own supply. Cocaine reduces Tony Montana to a paranoid personality prone to absurdly violent outbursts. He's got enough muscle around to protect him from his public displays of idiocy, but no one can offer solace when the government picks him up on a money-laundering sting. Facing a few years in jail, everything would have worked out for the best if he had just helped Sosa assassinate a pesky investigator threatening to expose the South American cocaine industry. Instead, Montana goes off the deep end and ruins everything he worked so hard to earn. The world, it turns out, only belonged to Antonio Montana for a very short time.<br /><br />\\"Scarface\\" works on so many levels that I should have chucked the summary and spent time talking about the subtexts. Arguably the most prominenttheme in the film is how Tony Montana typifies a sort of alternate American dream. Just as millions of other immigrants did before him, he came to America to secure his future. That this future involved streets paved with cocaine instead of gold makes no difference. There has always been a certain segment of each immigrant group that came here and turned to crime. Tony is just another example of this process. But forget about all that. We all enjoy \\"Scarface\\" for the over the top violence, the awesome performances, and the imaginative use of four letter words. The chainsaw scene, the helicopter hanging, and the apocalyptic shoot 'em up denouement are all here in Technicolor brilliance. As for the acting, Pacino is vivid and flashing as the chillingly violent Tony Montana. Bauer, Pfeiffer, and Loggia provide the perfect backdrop against which Pacino does his thing. It's also nice to see F. Murray Abraham turn in a gem of performance as the sleazy Omar, Lopez's top aide. And that Giorgio Moroder score! Pure heaven!<br /><br />The second disc of this twofer DVD set is somewhat of a disappointment. We get several documentaries about the making of the movie that cover many aspects of the film's conception, production, and problems, but it doesn't feel like enough. A documentary about how \\"Scarface\\" influenced the thugs in the rap industry? Give me a break! And while the very short featurette on the humorous dubbings used in the television versions bring forth a few chuckles, it was hardly worth waiting for. This is a film that screams for several in-depth commentary tracks, and we don't get a single one. Anyway, at least the movie looks great for the first time in years. \\"Scarface\\" is a modern masterpiece that must find a place on your shelf posthaste.ominent theme in the film is how Tony Montana typifies a sort of alternate American dream.

B000059XUP|4.0|This film is a great dark vision of life and it questions our faith and trust in it that has some density only in our illusion of love. Life is nothing but a showcase that hides the real dark world of death that lurks behind the wings of the crow, the wings of the stage on which we strut like peacocks. And in those wings we could find, if we dared to go behind them, death in all its forms, in all its shapes, be it drugs, be it extreme sex, be it violence, be it torture, be it suffering. There is no escape from this unfathomable truth. This vision is a deep dive and high jump into what rots and reeks beneath the surface of our sunny world, of our rich society, of our brilliant culture. Beneath it all there is only the coming doom of the end forecast by some blind visionary, some blinded priestess, some self-blinded witch that will cast her oracle onto us when she wants, when she decides, because it is her fate to do so when her blind vision will cease or become too bright for her eternal night. What can we do against this destiny ? Nothing except maybe become as bad as all this is, and get our vengeance on the puppets who are manipulated by some evil force that they do not even know exists. Evil is eternal and bottomless. Evil is the only future we keep in our heritage from the dark centuries of the past. He who thinks God is dead is right. He who thinks Satan never existed is right. He who thinks that man is the only perpetrator of his own doom is right. The doom of humanity will not come from some transcending force but only from the rule that the supreme predator that man is will eventually destroy the whole species, and man is already at work in that direction, some men being ready to kill everyone and even the planet and life as a whole in the name of the survival of the fitter, that is to say of them who will then destroy themselves when they do not have any more preys to chase after and kill. The survival of the fittest, then, will mean the end of the whole humanity and the return of chaos, which is nature naked and brutal because chaos is a human concept to describe the natural order of the eternal cycle of life and death. And in our malediction we may keep, in the deepest and darkest layers of our mental eye, the image of a child that could not survive this hazardous providence. God bless the child. But since the child is dead who can bless hilm ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUmanity and the return of chaos, which is nature naked and brutal because chaos is a human concept to describe the natural order of the eternal cycle of life and death.

B00008RV1L|5.0|Apparently the Finnish and those from our lovely neighbor to the north (Canada) have absolutely no taste in movies and lack a sense of humor.  How can anyone not like this movie?  I would dislike being you. <br /> <br />I have to return some videotapes.
B000063UR1|4.0|No, it probably won't be remembered as well as 2001: A Space Odessey or Planet of the Apes, but Silent Running deserves a closer look.  Silent Running was one of the first movies to present space as a commercial venture.  Indeed, if you pause some of the ATV sequences in the cargo bay of Valley Forge, you will see names like Coca Cola, Dow, and Celestron Pacific.  When he observes Earth you will notice he is using a Celestron 8 telescope, a popular scope when this movie was made.   <br />The movie did not accurately predict what we would have at the turn of the century (we're still struggling with unmanned probes in the outer Solar System) although computers are actually more advanced than those in the movie.  One prediction, though, may well be true: Successful ventures into the outer Solar System probably will require at least some backing from business.   <br />Despite the fact that we now live in a time past the original setting for the movie, it is an enjoyable film well worth owning. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|1.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan, and having really enjoyed the first two movies, I was very eager to see 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', and now I wish I had rented it and saved my money.  There is almost no character development, and Hogwarts now looks as if it is a ruin.  But perhaps worst of all it is a poorly constructed movie.  My husband, who has not read the books, but thoroughly enjoyed the first two movies, was completely lost in this one.  Scenes change quickly, frequently with no explanation, and while this is not a serious problem if you have read the book, for others it makes for a choppy, disjointed mess.  Let's hope that if they make the fourth movie, they'll change directors.
B00005NC66|5.0|Perhaps I will be the first to admit something no self-respecting film critic would say about such a brilliant period of filmmaking, The French New Wave (a movement that was solidified between the late 1950s and 1960s).  I didn't like BREATHLESS the first time I saw it.  In fact, I even had the audacity to publish a review here, that first time, stating that I didn't like it because of its style, as well as the overall way it left me feeling (completely unresolved).  Of course, no one found my review helpful.  I had a lot of nerve, taking on one of the most definitive films of that era and boldly putting it down!  Upon second reflection, I realize that the feeling it left me with was intended, and also why it was hailed as one of the greatest films from the time period.  Therefore, I felt compelled (since I deleted that old review) to properly acknowledge BREATHLESS, directed by Jean Paul Belmondo, as the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I don't want to waste too much space, here, re-telling it.  I will say that Jean-Paul Belmondo, as Michel, our \\"anti-hero\\" is deliciously unsavory and the ultimate wise guy.  This thug idolizes Humphrey Bogart and feels very comfortable to make the stand as an anarchist in the face of the law, society and his girlfriend, Patricia (Jean Seberg).  BREATHLESS follows these two and their exploits, through jagged camera angles and really thrives on a \\"less is more\\" approach.  There is a great deal of subtlety here.  That includes numerous, off the cuff references to cinema, the director and his work as a critic, and plenty of double entendre.  I really reccomend this, because if a film has the capacity to drive someone to such frustration and irritation and then bring about a total 180 degree change of heart so many years later, that is certainly an example of compelling cinema.
0393320928|5.0|Feynman's book \\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\\" is a lot of fun. But fun was not the only thing in Feynman's life. \\"What Do you Care What Other People Think\\" is a rather different book. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong: there are various funny stories in this book, too. And the book also describes various controversies - for example the story in which the silly feminists called Feynman \\"a sexist pig\\". Feynman never hesitated to inform morons (especially the pompous fools) that they were morons, and this book is another proof of it. Nevertheless, the main focus of the book is different. <br /> <br />Feynman first talks about his childhood - especially his father who taught him to question the orthodox thinking, and who probably always wanted Richard to become a scientist. On the other hand, Feynman's father was not an intellectual. One of the special features of Feynman is that he was brought up in an ordinary family - not in a family of professors which is unfortunately the case of most professors today. <br /> <br />The second part of the book is very sad and very emotional. It's about his first wife, Arlene. I think that the book will show you how much they loved each other and how big influence Arlene had on Feynman. Well, a problem was that she suffered from tuberculosis. She was dying while Feynman was working on the atomic bomb in Los Alamos. This part of the book could compete with any good fiction - the difference is that this story is real and it happened to one of the most influential physicists of all time. I am sure that you will agree that Feynman's heart was at least as strong as his brain. <br /> <br />However, it's not just a sad love story: Feynman also describes their tricks that they used to send letters to each other (circumventing the censorship in Los Alamos) and other amusing details of this period. <br /> <br />The third portion (about 55%) of the book is dedicated to the commission that investigated the explosion of the Challenger, the space shuttle in 1986. Feynman was always eager to get to the very heart of the matter and he never cared whether he looked \\"nice\\" to others. Even Ronald Reagan knew about that, and therefore he personally asked Feynman to serve on the committee (with Neil Armstrong and others). <br /> <br />Feynman did not disappoint and the book reveals the findings in depth - well sometimes the description is too detailed, I would say. It shows how some people in NASA - for example an executive called William Rogers - preferred the image (their personal image as well as the image of NASA) over the truth. You will also learn about many technical details that have led to the explosion. Feynman was thinking differently - unlike the chairman of the commission who thought that everyone should sit in a room and ask the experts, Feynman decided to talk to the engineers. Feynman's analysis is also a critique of the government bureaucracy. <br /> <br />Although NASA was probably a unified force when it sent the first men to the Moon, it became fragmented afterwards, Feynman argues. The engineers estimated the probability of the failure to be about 1:300, while the top bosses were painting an optimistic picture to the Congress that the probability of an explosion was about 1:100,000, and NASA can be both cheap as well as efficient. <br /> <br />Feynman's most visible conclusion is that the space shuttle program may have been a mistake because the public had to be fooled that the project was better than it actually was.  <br /> <br />Feynman always believed that the public must be allowed to decide whether they want to fund you and your projects, after you honestly tell them what the project means. Unlike many unrealistic people in the academia who believe that an arbitrary amount of money paid for an arbitrary project in science is a good investment - and that it is always OK to fool the ordinary people to get some money - Feynman understood economics and the workings of the society very well. Moreover, honesty was his primary goal in debates with the laymen. <br /> <br />At the end of the book, Feynman advocates science and its principles. However, you don't need to be trained in physics to understand the book.
0792833236|5.0|Some movies seem real and some seem phony. All Kubrick's films seem phony and detached. Spielberg seems infantile. This film is so totally engaging it seems more real even than reality. After I'd watched it I had to ask myself if it was in black and white, and check. One reviewer points out that some of the shots (the home movies?) are in colour. I didn't even notice that when watching the film. How did Scorsese achieve this? The performances are so vivid and intense you feel as if you are right in the room, the kitchen, the night-club, even the ring, with those characters. There are plenty of people like this; I've met and known them. I even boxed for a while when I was a boy. I've observed these kinds of man-and-wife relationships. I don't think this study of the LaMotta character is unsympathetic. He is redeemed by his durability and courage. The end-piece suggests that he had been blind, but now he sees. An exceedingly fine film. It must be one of the half-dozen best ever made.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira... what can i say? it's simply amazing. most people who hate the story are just to stupid to understand it. they want it put on a plate for them and spoonfed...yeah TRY THINKING!!! this is stunning animation at it's very very best. buy it at once. you wont be annoyed with the choice if u have at least half a brain cell (1 star reviewers im looking at you!!) have fun with this classic. coz like it or not, it is a classic.
6305603847|5.0|alright, now...this movie is psychotic, graphic and at time wierd, but these things add to the masterpeice of the original album. despite the ravings of certain people who claim to be great floyd fans, this movie DOES have a plot. it jumps around quite a bit true, but it is  a great musical ( and I hate musicals usually) I would suggest listening to the album first, because if you understand the plot in the album (that has a plot too) then you'll eaisily understand the plot in the movie. if your a fan and you've ever listened to the album and thought of the situations the songs put in mind then this movie is definatley for you.
B0000E64TR|5.0|You don't need to be a total Elton fan to appreciate fully this SACD and experience a great album. If you are a fan who knows every word - your eyes will be opened even wider with the fantastic surround mix. (You can even solo the center speaker to hear Elton's vocal by itself - AMAZING!).<br /><br /> I've been in a room with 70 plus people where Greg Penny spoke and played the mixes - the applause and emotion was overwhelming. He won the surround awards this year for a reason - this SACD is a mega- monolithic-masterpiece!<br /><br />Favorite tracks : Danny Bailey, Alice, Grey Seal and Benny...  The Candle remix is extremely cool...<br /><br />The DVD Video is well worth the additional cost - plus it is a double record...<br /><br />If you don't own a player - I recommend the $ 175ish Pioneer Hybrid player that plays SACD, DVD Audio, DVD movies, CD's CDR's and MP3's...  It rocks.<br /><br />My only wish is that everyone could hear this disc on a good 5.1 system. I'm foolish enough to think it might actually bring back fidelity and change the music industry for the better... Please God... Please...
B0002SROSQ|5.0|When I was in a thrash band called Gothic Playground back in the late 1980's, an interview with the band stated (that we said)that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds was noted as one of our biggest influences.  After reading this, we discussed confusion and distrust of the press, since none of us had ever heard them.  The writer of the interview is now a political writer for a well respected news organization.  Scarry, huh?  Anyway, I saw them in the movie \\"Wings of Desire\\" and didn't see any connection.  So I never had the chance to listened to them again.  I saw this cd set a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  #$%%^*$, this is GREAT.  Abattoir Blues is best in the car VERY LOUD.  Lyre of Orheus is at a lower level, but equally good.  What they did is not release a two cd set, but two distinctlively different albums at the same time.  Extreme.  BUY THIS ONE NOW!!!
B00013PHGS|4.0|\\"Talkie Walkie\\" is the latest CD from the French duo known as Air, and it's exactly what Air fans look for from their music. Although usually lumped in the same broad category as Massive Attack and Zero 7, Air's music is usually far more subtle and romantic than their closest downtempo cousins. Despite the vintage synthesizers heard on several tracks, Air rely more heavily on traditional analog and acoustic instrumentation than do other chillout acts. Despite this production choice, Air do not come across as ironic or retro - this is clearly a CD intended for the 21st Century. It's psychedelic without being trippy or kitschy. Although none of the songs on \\"Talkie Walkie\\" can be considered crossover pop or rock material, all are soothing, ingenious pieces of mood music. ('Surfing on a Rocker' is the closest they come to a hit here) It's as challenging or as relaxing as you, the listener, choose it to be. Don't expect to dance to this; expect to reflect on this. It would be perfect as the soundtrack to a arty film about relationships. <br /> <br />The bonus DVD consists of a bewilderingly edited concert performance. Live, doing material from Moon Safari, Air almost come across as an updated version of Pink Floyd's Pompeii years. Unfortunately, the concert footage is intercut with shots of the touring band on the road and interviews. Still, this is a great bonus, and makes the CD an even better value!  <br /> <br />If you enjoy Air, this CD is a must-have. I only wish there were more songs collected here, since all the songs are of a similarly high quality.
B0000029DD|3.0|Jeff Buckley was taken far too early, this is true; but that does not mean that this mediocre album deserves the status it has achieved.  Jeff has a lovely voice, and plays a mean guitar, his musical talents cannot be questioned, however, his lyrical and compositional talents can.  Jeff was a very promising talent, and based on this work here, a stellar career would have lay ahead; this is evident in a few of the standout tracks from Grace.  First and foremost, the shining star, the brilliant jewel of the album is Buckley's take on \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen.  The fact that this is the one that everyone mentions, speaks volumes about Buckley.  First, there is of course his talent: the delicate fingerpicked guitar, and his gorgeous tenor floating overtop, but there is more to that.  The fact that the most realized and focused song on the album is a cover brings out Buckley's biggest fault: lack of direction.  Most if not all of the songs, and the album itself, lack a concise sense of direction.  Both \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"So Real\\" stick out like sore thumbs, both also suffer from meandering instrumentals.  Buckley regularly strays from the song for a bit of \\"wanking off.\\"  Even a musical novice can tell he is a more than competent guitarist, I would go as far  to say a great guitarist, but Buckley pounds it home mercilessly, with incessant digressions.  What Jeff needed was a father figure (since his father, a musician himself, was lost at a young age as well), a veteran producer, or writer to help Jeff channel his abilities, like what George Martin was for the Beatles.  Had Jeff had his own Martin, this could have easily been one of the finest albums of the 90's, but as it stands now, it remains a depressing reminder of the greatness that could have been.
0316031070|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B00066N8JS|5.0|This re-release of TDS is like listening to the album again for the first time. The excess of this type of thing might lead you to believe it's just a marketing gimmick, but that is simply not the case here. Of course, if anyone could perfect something that was already perfected, it's Trent Reznor.<br /><br />First of all, the 13-track bonus disc is reason enough to buy this deluxe edition for any NIN fan since it has three previously unreleased demos. That might sound like peanuts to fans of any other band, but NIN fans know that on the rare occasion you get to hear something you've never heard before from Mr. Reznor, you cherish it. Also contained within are a handful of the best remixes from the singles and the \\"Further Down The Spiral\\" versions which are nice to have on one disc. Then you have the Joy Division cover \\"Dead Souls\\" and \\"Burn\\" from The Crow and the Natural Born Killers soundtracks, respectively. Last but not least is the Soft Cell cover, \\"Memorabilia\\" which is an excellent track and it sounds fantastic here.<br /><br />Getting on to the good stuff, the album itself is a whole new listening experience. Everything feels more alive, more crisp, more precise than it did before. When you've listened to The Downward Spiral as much as the average NIN fan does, you start to pick up on things you never noticed the first 50 times you heard the song. Well that is what the deluxe edition feels like. Hearing new things all over again, letting your senses soak up the layers upon layers of... well, noise. There was a lot of it to begin with, and here it just becomes even more evident, and beautiful. You can never truly appreciate the artestry and brilliance put into the masterpieces which are Nine Inch Nails albums, until you hear them multiple times. That said, we are now able to let it happen all over again.<br /><br />Reznor couldn't have marked the 10-year anniversary of The Downward Spiral any better, and it is definitely a must have for any Nine Inch Nails fan, or someone who just never owned the album in the first place. It sounds great even if you don't own an SACD player or have 5.1 surround sound. Highly recommended.ails fan, or someone who just never owned the album in the first place. It sounds great even if you don't own an SACD player or have 5.1 surround sound. Highly recommended.
B0000089A1|5.0|I was listening to this one in on the way home last night.  The best way to listen to an album is to be \\"trapped\\" in a car with a good stereo.  The bazooka tube on FEEL.  This remastered version is worth the extra money.  And, it's a great album.  \\"Denmark Street\\" is my favorite.
B000002UDB|3.0|Without a doubt, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" contains some of the Beatles' best late 1960s work. Songs like 'Strawberry Fields,' 'Penny Lane,' 'I Am the Walrus,' and 'Fool on the Hill' are proof positive that the Beatles were among the very best and creative rock bands of all time. They're essential songs both yesterday and today. However, much of the other material here is just filler. 'Your Mother Should Know' and 'Flying' are okay, but 'Blue Jay Way' is one of the most monotonous dirges George Harrison ever recorded. None of those three songs would even be remembered if they were recorded by any other late 1960s rock band.    If you're a new Beatles fan on a budget, and all you own is \\"1,\\" you'll find very little duplication between the contents of that CD and this one. It's a good choice. I would recommend, however, purchasing 'The Beatles: 1967-1970' aka \\"The Blue Album\\" as it contains all the best material from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" plus selections from \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"The White Album,\\" and \\"Abbey Road.\\" Again, the highlights of this CD are worth owning, but it's difficult to justify buying an album with so many weak tracks unless you are particularly in love with the admittedly well-designed cover art.
B000005Z0G|5.0|2pac remains one of the most realest artists of our time not only lyrically but overall as an artist (rapper, actor, dancer, writer).  His humble beginnings ever apparent, we were never allowed to forget (nor would we allow him to) that he was a man who represented the forgotten, though not silent youth.  It is in this particular album that 2pac really shows his versatility.  No he is not a \\"gangsta\\" rapper as was the term used at the time.  2pac's consciousness of the world surrounding him and his peers was what allowed rappers (like Nas and others in the conscious rap genre) to come forth with lyrics that meant something.   Lyrics that your mom could agree with without losing the realistic brutality of it all (ie Brenda's gotta baby, Papaz song).  Yet he never let us forget the anger of the streets that would keep him from achieving all that he could have (Souljahz song, and among many others the albums title song).  If you happened to miss 2pac's development as an artist then start with this album going all the way up to his most recent release and see if you dont find that raw emotion, that raw expression, and best of all the consciousness that it will not fall on deaf ears.  If you witnessed but dont remember it like I do, then get this album and change your way of thought.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Jaws is the best movie ever made. I will spend the rest of my review explaining why. <br /> <br />I have yet to see a movie be so many different types of films and be effective at all of them. Jaws is a thriller, a horror film, a drama, an adventure, it has comedy and tragedy.  It has elements of a revenge movie and it has elements of redemption story. The film succeeds on all these levels and it did so by accident.  <br /> <br />Jaws went into production without a script and without the actual shark. Just to keep busy in Martha's Vineyard the crew wrote and shot material to have something to do. Carl Gotlieb spent evenings writing material for the next day with Spielberg. This shifted the focus of the movie toward the characters, not the shark. It also gave the crew ample time to continue to develop these characters. By the time the crew of three sail out to see to hunt the shark, each character is fully developed and realized. The movie never looses site of the human emotional side of the equation. They don't let the audience forget that the sharks victims are sons and daughters, friends and relatives. The victims aren't just props in the story but they are real to the characters in the story. <br /> <br />Also the fact that the mechanical shark did malfunction actually improved the movie. The shark was much scarier off screen than it was on. Spielberg and the crew also were very good at getting the most out of visual representations, such as the barrels and the unforgettable score by John Williams. In addition I contend the shark is a very compelling character of the film too. The shark seems to be hunting Hooper, Quint and Brody as much as they are hunting it which adds a very compelling dynamic to the film. And in regard to the shark effects, it is my opinion that this film features better effects work than any shark related film made after it, including the cgi sharks of Deep Blue Sea (which is a bad movie incidentally).  <br /> <br />Jaws was a horrible filmshoot but may have had one of the finest crews in movie history with Verna Fields editing, John Williams score, and Steven Spielberg directing his second feature. Let's not forget Zannuck and Brown who still produce some of the finest films today. The collective talent on this film pulled off a miracle and changed the way the film industry marketed films for better or for worse. This is also the lone movie I can think of where the film actually exceeds the quality of the original book. A flawless example of storytelling, Jaws has remained and will continue to be my favorite movie of all time. <br />
B00063F8B2|5.0|When I saw this movie, I got the sniffles during \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\". I still do. Tom Hank's \\"Hot Chocolate\\" was great, coming from a tap dancer like me. But the best song was, ofcourse, JOSH GROBAN'S \\"BELIEVE\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I encourage you to get this CD and any other ones featuring JOSH GROBAN! You'll fall in love with his voice the minute you listen to one of his songs.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|If this is your first introduction to dramatic film then you've found a GREAT place to start. This movie stands as one of my favorites for the emotion and myriad of experiences that it opens one up to.  If you are a fan of Fight Club or American Beauty this will take you beyond those realms into an actual and tangible reality that occurs in proximity regardless of where you reside.  Almost every person whom I've introduced to this film immediately becomes repulsed by the images portrayed.  Namely, the film can leave a film on your tongue.  However, a wise person once said that traits we hate in others can often be found in ourselves.  I would recommend that you view the film and whatever your initial reaction you should examine what sparks the topics discussed (displayed) set in motion for you.  I also recommend reading the movie's fold in leaflet along with watching the \\"Memories....\\" special feature on this edition.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If I had to use just one word to describe this film it would be \\"FUN!\\". Shaun of the Dead continues a steady trend of high quality, small budget British films over the last few years (as I've really enjoyed About a Boy, Maybe Baby, and Love Actually). This film is not a horror film at heart, but a romantic comedy. The film never looses focus of the characters and despite the many zombies, the characters never loose focus of their personal problems. In a way the movie mirrors our world and the way people adapt to their environments. Despite the mounting conflicts and wars worldwide, we as individuals as a whole are still mired in our small personal dramas, weather it be romantic, work related, or little squabbles.  <br /> <br />There are scenes that get very intense but the film makers also follow the intensity up with great comedy. Shaun of the Dead is hands down the funniest movie of the year. I laughed out loud multiple times. The laughs are generated mostly by the lead characters, not the zombie's which lends a unique feel to the film.  <br /> <br />It's a shame this movie didn't find a wider audience in the theaters. If you are a fan of comedy and are not too squeamish about gore (after all it is a zombie movie) this movie will be quite a treat for you I know I look forward to seeing it again! <br />
0316779237|2.0|Immediately before reading this I had read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and loved it so much I thought I'd pick this up.  It just happened to be the holidays so this seemed a natural choice.  I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Four of the six entries here are fictional which halps make his biographical essays that much more believeable.  The \\"Santaland Diaries\\" is decent. There are funny parts but the diary aspect of it makes it choppy and I have found his humor best when he controls the flow of the story rather than cutting together some events.<br /><br />The other biographical essay here is \\"Dinah, The Christmas Whore\\" which I found the best essay here but is what I would call the literary version of a b-side.<br /><br />By the end I found that I was enjoying the entries so little I was skipping large chunks hoping to get to a good part.<br /><br />After my first book from David Sedaris I was eagerly looking forward to another one.  After this I'm not so sure.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is an album during Pink Floyds early years so they were experimenting around yet it was after Barret left. I have a very open mind toward music, maybe thats why I love this album so much. If u like \\"Meddle\\" then buy this album! they both have similar styles of music. This album will grow on you with time so be open minded while first listening to it. <br /> <br />Atom Heart Mother: 23 minutes long yet it has a great beat and instrumentals. Brilliant! <br /> <br />If: A slower song but its lyrics are genius! I never skip this song. <br /> <br />Summer 68: Has a great melody and vocals. <br /> <br />Fat Old Sun: Beautiful lyrics and a lot of imagery. Brings back old memories. <br /> <br />Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast: Makes me think of Breakfast on Sunday mornings. I allways laugh when the guys eats cuz he sounds like a pig! lol. Brilliant!

B00024I2Z4|4.0|This film is one of my very favorite Disney films, brimming with memorably catchy songs and stunning visuals. The storyline is usual Disney fare at heart, but one must realize that it is indeed a children's film. Overanalyzing the storyline of a children's film is like scratching an itch with a knife - a little overkill. But Mulan's story is filled with messages of honor, strength, the importance of family, brotherhood, and love. It is s a film filled with humor, color, music, and values. A true Disney classic.
B00008OE4W|4.0|This film is surprisingly good in what it attempts to portray - the vulnerability of our systems to unauthorised access and the potential for data misuse.  Essentially the film is about cryptography and does not really focus on hacking in any direct way thus making it just as relevant today as it was back in 1992. The cast headed by Robert Redford give an outstanding performance, especially David Strathairn as a blind hacker with impressive hands-on skills.  Very enjoyable and well paced.
B0002TB6IO|5.0|This singer/songwrite deserves a wider audience cos' once you've heard his music, you are blown away. He is a true poet/musician but can mostly do anything from folk to jazz to soul to blues. This is a delicious album full of moods and melodies and if anything is even better than his early timeless gems. Until a year ago I had no idea who Terry Callier was, then heard Theme From Spartacus, wnet out and bought Timepeace and was hooked. Its so wicked to hear an artist for the first time and get that chill factor. Why didn't I know about Mr callier earlier? Because so-called commercial radio doesn't play off the wall music, or feature different lo-key artists. That's their loss but is also the loss to lots of people who otherwise don't get the opportunity to listen to different vibes. So pass the word on this great singer/songwriter if his music moves you.
6305972591|4.0|AND HE'S SO WILD ABOUT ME! This is a good Stephen King movie. The beginning of it is very violent!! The whole movie is also strange, which is cool! If I was to pick any of my favorite Steven King classics, this would be one of them. It is about 2 people who are driving through Nebraska and they come across an apparently dead kid in the road. Everyone else there worships a cornfield and has weird rituals and stuff. They must enjoy killing people because it is part of their mumbo-jumbo religion which is one that you don't see everyday. The ending is also very violent and it has a good plot. I think the end is one of it's best parts! The cornfield death is just a little gory too. This movie is definetely recommended if you like Stephen King's stuff. Peace out.
B000065V41|5.0|I remember the Muppets from when I was a child.  My sisters and I would scramble to finish homework and get prepared for bed so that we would be allowed to \\"stay up\\" and watch Kermit and his troop, along with the marvelous guest stars.  This version of Charles Dicken's classic story - though it may seem silly at first thought - is accurate, moving, and memorable.  My father gave it to us on VHS years ago and it became a family classic.  My father - very much a \\"manly man\\" - would make time in his busy schedule to watch this with us every Christmas season.  Summer 2002, we gathered around his hospital bed to watch it one more time together as a family.   <br /> <br />The music is appropriate and moving from the opening song about Scrooge - \\"When a cold wind blows it chills you - chills you to the bone!\\" - to the last scene of the friends and family together singing \\"The Love We've Found\\".  I find myself singing \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" months after watching the movie.  All of the music is wonderful! <br /> <br />Perhaps it is the genius of the comedic touch which makes this version so much better than the others.  In typical Muppet style, physical comedy is added to the mix.  Who can forget Rizzo the Rat's plunge from the top of the iron fence into the snow, then his dash back through the bars because he forgot his bag of food?  And \\"Light the lamp, not the rat!\\"  If you have not watched this version, you have truly missed something wonderful.  Make this one of the \\"must see\\" movies of the holiday season - or any time of the year!
B00004T6V4|4.0|Although not as widely available here in the US as Europe, I was very pleased to get hold of this soundtrack after seeing the movie. Having seen (and reviewed) the movie adds an extra enjoyment to the CD, but it is actually a pretty good stand alone album otherwise. If you don't know the movie - Strange Fruit are an allegorical world famous band from the 70's era, and as difficult as it is to recreate that kind of sound, the producers here are to be congratulated. You will listen and come away thinking these guys were real, and were previously huge, and that's an achievement when you consider that it is the cast of ACTORS in the movie actually singing on the soundtrack - NOT stand ins. Jimmy Nail revisits his dulcet tones, which brought him moderate success as a solo artist back in the late 80's / early 90's and there are a couple of tracks from other artists. Otherwise it's Bill Nighy and the cast belting out the tunes to great effect. An umistakable 70's panache underpins the all original score, with long instrumental bridge work breaking up lyrics, and some thrash guitars, and even \\"Glam\\" rock effects for good measure. This is a very good album for a lot of reasons, and will make you want to see the movie if you haven't, and underline it sweetly if you have. I challenge you not to be moved by the haunting lyrics of the first (and movie signature) track \\"The Flame Still Burns\\". Quite expensive here in the USA, so if you know anyone in Eurpoe, get them to send it to you! Enjoy
B00005JNEI|5.0|Well this is a great movie will open people up to things that you wont normally see because the government doesnt want you too see it. Which is just why George Bush tried to stop this movie from coming out.

But on the other hand, she has a very attractive face and personality.  <br /> <br />overall this dvd was ok to watch for the 2 or 3 times, after that it is just unbearable, and it's sitting collecting dust all by itself now.  <br /> <br /> <br />i know a lot of evanescence fans are white teenager girls popping bubble gums and relay don't know much about artists like joe satriani, steve vai, yngwie malmsteen (guitar gods).  <br /> <br /> <br />what i wish for: more variety in songs from them. get a new dvd editor next time. show some individual band member talent! write music that fits your personality!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|What can I say about this CD..it's a U2 classic. We've come to expect great things from U2 everytime they put out an album..and HTDAAB does not dissapoint. It's got everything, the rocking tunes, the beautiful ballads and everything in between. My personal favourites are &quot;Sometimes you Can't Make It On Your Own&quot; (# 3), &quot;Crumbs From Your Table&quot; (# 8), and &quot;Original of The Species&quot;. Each part of every single song is inspirational: the lyrics, the melody. Each band member delivers, especially the frontment, The Edge, with his great guitar riffs, and Bono, with the always passionate vocals. <BR>         U2 doesn't come out with an album every year, and they've been critizised for that it the past. But take it from a real U2 fan, the wait is well worth it. Instead of producing a garbage album every year, the most artists do, U2 takes their time to make a CD that I could listen to every day (which I do) and not get bored (which I'm not). And FYI, if you're on the fence about buying this CD, do it. Take the plunge. It will, I guarantee you, be worth every penney.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I really admire love it or hate it movies. These projects may be just God-awful to some people, but I admire the bravado these films have in taking real risks where Hollywood is content to follow the Xerox copy formula. <br />      Dogville represents a very theatrical point-of-view. Its style seems more at home on Masterpiece Theatre then the silver screen. This is what makes it all the more engaging to me. The stripped-bare quality lets you really become involved with the characters and the situation. If a real town would have been there, it would only serve to distract you from what von Trier knew all too well: a town is only the people who make it up. By removing the town walls, the characters are open to us at all times. Likewise, the barries they put to their souls are removed as well.  <br />     I didn't find Dogville to be really anti-American. Instead I found a universal message which is unsettling as it is true. \\"It's very easy for ordinary people to justify being horrific to other human beings.\\" <br />Dogville is not for anyone who feels they have to be pulled into a movie. It is very much for the people who engage themselves.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This cd is absolutly brilliant. I love the film so much so when i looked up the soundtrack and had a listen, i immediatly asked for it for christmas! Its loud and powerful music but in a good way. Its also got some slow music but i recon number 3, the black pearl, the classic pirates of the caribbean soundtrack, is the best one! I definitely give this 10/10. If you liked the film you'll love the soundtrack!
B00066N8JS|5.0|I have to agree with Mr. nothingnext, for any true NIN fan it is totally worth buying for the 3 unreleased demos (repitle is incredible). The downward spiral, one of the few cd's I always listen to all the way through, sounds incredible...totally remastered , believe me folks there is a difference. The packaging is beautiful. This is one of the coolest things ever put out by an artist and I cant wait for \\"with teeth\\"(new nin cd due in early 05). Reznor keeps his fans hungry for a long time , but never dissapoints when he finally throws a bone.
B0000025D0|5.0|The best record Sprinsgteen ever made. \\"Well\\", you say, \\"it's got some pretty lofty company don't you think?\\" <br /> <br />That it does. But you know what? If you really listen to this one a few times, I don't think it's such a difficult choice to make. Chances are, few of us who say this would have said so the first time around. This isn't a record that kicks the front door in and flings the expensive china at the walls in the way that Born to Run did. DOTEOT is much more subtle, much more grown-up, much quieter, and about a thousand times as lethal. <br /> <br />One is almost at a loss for words to describe the sheer emotional impact of this record; it's as if Springsteen did 30 years of living instead of the three since Born to Run was made. <br />Not only is it a much more understated work musically, but the joyous optimism that permeated Born to Run is absent in spades. The main theme running through this record is regret - at times so palpable you think you're drowning in it. Regret, anger, failure, loneliness, dashed hopes - but never done in a maudlin or overblown way.  <br /> <br />I'd like to just briefly talk about the songs - and apologies if some of the previous reviewers have said the same things, but if so then it bears repeating: <br /> <br />1. \\"Badlands\\" - not much to say other than it's another classic anthem we all know. You'll notice the much lower-key approach as compared with songs like \\"Thunder Road or \\"Born to Run\\". <br /> <br />2. \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" - tough, hard-rocking song about the frictions between father & son. \\"You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past, Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain, now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame\\". ouch. <br /> <br />3. \\"Something in the Night\\" - starts with an absolutely gorgeous, wistful piano figure from Bittan. The one gripe I have with this song is Weinberg's drumming - the song's pace is stately enough, and Max seems intent onslowing it down even further. I really didn't care at all for the protracted roll that all but ruins the beginning, either. All is forgiven at the end though, when the opening piano figure is reprised over Bruce's heartfelt \\"wawwwwwwww\\" in the background. More brilliant lyrics about the pain of regret and powerlessness. One of Bruce's greatest compositions that falls just short of being a great song. <br /> <br />4. \\"Candy's Room\\" - all I can think is that Bruce must have had a chuckle when he wrote this one - but he sure seems to be singing it with a straight face. Who knows? Even the so-called \\"comic relief\\" songs on this record bite! <br /> <br />5. \\"Racing In the Street\\" - the jewel of the record and one of the most poignant, heartbreaking songs ever written by Bruce, or by anybody on God's green earth. A momument to regret, to having blown it and knowing it full well, to \\"if only, if only, if only\\". I'd bet the bank that this song has made many a tough guy totally break down. The band is absolutely perfect in every way, right down to the fade.  <br /> <br />6. \\"Promised Land\\" - see my Badlands comment. Lyrically, a ray of light and hope but still nowhere near as exuberant as before. <br /> <br />7. \\"Factory\\" - another very understated lament. Doesn't sound like much of anything at all the first few times until the anguished lyrics really sink in, particularly the last verse. <br /> <br />8. \\"Streets of Fire\\" - more weary regret, and in my opinion a clear foreshadowing of the protagonist of the song \\"Born in the USA'. Great lyrics as always but not the most memorable tune. <br /> <br />9. \\"Prove it All Night\\" - possibly the most lightweight thing on the record. I won't say \\"throwaway\\" because after all it was the hit single, and the chorus is actually damned catchy. Just when you think you've got a nice little pop song, the final verse throws a pretty good right cross. <br /> <br />10. \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" - the perfect way to end the record, with its\\"I'll go down, but I'll go down fighting\\" sentiment. The protagonist of the song knows he's already lost everything, but: <br /> <br />\\"Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cos I can't stop <br /> I'll be on that hill with everything I got <br /> Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost <br /> I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost <br /> For wanting things that can only be found <br /> In the darkness at the edge of town\\" <br /> <br />And here ends one of the most powerful works of music by anyone, anytime, anywhere. There's not much else to say. <br /> <br />
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Usually I am a tough sell. Let me put it simply for you. If you ar e a maiden fan, This is the video you have waited for your whole life. AWESOME DOCUMENTARY, tons of uncut footage, not just single songs. Video we have only seen segnments of in past documentaries. You wont regret buying this one. Even with out considering my love of maiden this is objectively a great buy.
B00025ETIW|3.0|Or what do you do with an album whose song titles are infinitely more wittier than the songs themselves? I'd vaguely heard good things about this band and after briefly looking over the play list, I figured, hey, this is great - a bunch of wiseass New Jersey punks smirking their way to fame and glory. I mean, how can you go wrong with a CD that has tunes like \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Me In Prison\\" or \\"I Never Told You What I Did For A Living?\\" <br /> <br />Well, gosh darn you My Chemical Romance. This isn't a bad album (filled with pretty much what Green Day was doing ten years ago) but unless I'm completely missing something, this really isn't an ironic, post-modern take on what it's like to grow up in a collection of dead-end, souless suburbs. This is only working on one level and no, \\"Helena\\" is not some surreal cover of the old Chet Baker song, as one might have been led to expect. Oh well - back to my old Dead Boys tapes...
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is the greatest album ever made.  This was the first AC/DC cd that I bought.  After hearing TNT and others on the radio from this cd I thought that i'll get it, thinking that of course, there must be at least some filler, but no, there wasn't any filler; just complete high voltage thriller.  I was blown away by the majestic heights of the albums' riffs, especially my favorite AC/DC song ever, 'Live Wire'.  Future albums like \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\", and \\"Fly On The Wall\\" come close to this album but will never equal or surpass this album in sheer quality of music.  For Bon Scotts vocals combined with Angus's searing riffs will make anyone who listens to the cd, appreciate it for its true greatness in Rock N' Roll History.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Ms. Badu has gone and done it again. This sista is definitely talented. She has such style and class. Her music will never go out of style. I must say they will be bumping Worldwide Underground way over into the next millenium. This is truly a musical sweet!
B000002H33|5.0|Look I am a huge metallica an. they are literally considered metal. All this stuff now in days are not real metal. It's just a bunch of giberish that u can't even understand. Here are my favorite metal bands: Black Sabbath(Ozzy Osbourne), Led Zepplin, and Meatllica. Now i admit Metallica went down hill after the Black Album. But this CD is a masterpiece. There guitar solo's are amazing and there music is pure metal. Now thats my opinion but anbody who knows metal will probably agree with me. So buy whatever u want but if u want a real metal album or a classic buy this album. It's probably their best.

0439288886|1.0|I did not read this exact edition, but a very old copy I borowed from my grandpa. He had been bugging me to read Treasure Island for a long time because I liked the movie Pirates of the Caribbean, so he thought that I would love this book because of the pirates. I read it and was sooooooo bored! I could not even pay attention it was so boring. For about one page the book was exciting, but then it got dull. I am a freshman in high school, I read this book summer going into 9th grade and was bored to tears reading this! I understood the language, but what was said was boring and my attention wandered early on. I quit reading about three quarters finished. I returned the book, and I could tell Grandpa was shocked I didn't like the book... but I guess honesty is good. A friend of my parents said maybe I was bored because I am older and the book was mean for a lower reading level, but I don't know. All I can say is that this book really sucked. If you want to read a GOOD book read Harry Potter (my favorite!!), something by Dan Brown, or a Howard Moon Deer mystery by Robert Westbrook.  <br />Peace out! Happy reading!!

0062502182|2.0|I've read several of Paulo Coelho's works and have found each to be incredible, in particular The Alchemist. However, I must point out that I have done so in Spanish, which closely resembles Portugese, Coelho's native language.  Out of curiosity I began to read The Alchemist in its English translation and found it to be too sachrine and at times even dull.  Needlsess to say, I did't get very far into the English version before putting it down.<br /><br />If at all possible, I'd recomend to those who can to read The Alchemist in Spanish (a sophisticated knowledge of the Spanish language is not necesary; the vocabulary is quite simple).  The two-star rating refers to the English translation: Otherwise, this book would easily earn five stars.
6305181772|1.0|If you're a younger viewer you might be entertained by the gadgets and explosions. However, if you grew up watching the original T.V. series, as I did, you would walk away from this movie shouting, as did the late Greg Morris (who played Barney, the technical wiz, in the original series), \\"What an abomination!\\"  <br />   The series was about a highly skilled and disciplined group of elite intelligence agents who combine their unique talents and skills to accomplish missions deemed impossible in the ordinary wing of the C.I.A. Their success was made possible, partly, by their working as a single integrated team. Each had his or her specific task to perform as part of the overall plan. Mr. Phelps, the I.M.F. team leader, assembled his team and they developed the mission plan and procedures the way NASA, Grumman and North American Rockwell engineers did in accomplishing the moon missions. No one stood out or tried to dominate.  <br />   The movie completely wrecks this premise. Yes, it has the gadgets and high-tech stuff (like the laytex masks) and there seems to be a team of sorts, but that's all that the movie takes from the series. They purport to operate as a team, but that turns out to be an illusion. The entire team, except the one played by Tom Cruise, are double agents. Phelps (played by John Voight) turns out to be a traitor and enemy agent. They are all out to kill Tom Cruise, who has to save the world and kill Phelps and the entire I.M.F team as well -- all by himself, of course.  <br />   Cruise's ego demanded that no one else share the spotlight with him. He just appropriated the title, music and trademark gadgets of the Mission Impossible series to produce a one-man hero shoot-em-up and blow-em-up flick that has nothing to do with the original series. None of the original cast were offered roles in the movie. Offering Peter Graves (the original Phelps) a cameo part would have been the class thing to do. But neither the movie, nor Cruise, have any class. Teens would find it entertaining, but if you are an adult who remembers the original series, don't see this movie. You will be disappointed. <br />   Paramount should release the entire T.V. series -- all seasons -- on DVD.

I could honestly say that some parts of the information were confusing to me but other parts were pretty much simple to understand. I could even possbily try to get rich, maybe. Money is a powerful thing and people should take advantage and read this book if you want to be powerful with money.

B000002HRE|1.0|Whether or not Metallica sold out following \\"...And Justice for All\\" is debatable, but the fact of the matter is that this group no longer has the fire that drove them to produce their brilliant earlier works. Reload is the emobodiment of Metallica's newfound complacency. They don't push that extra ten percent, and it shows in the bland rythm sections and inconsequential lyrics. Metallica must have got bitten by the alt rock bug pretty badly.
B000244EMO|4.0|I recently bought a Fox DVD copy of John McTiernan's 1987 action-thriller *Predator*. An action-horror-survival film under-appreciated outside of comic book circles, it nevertheless influences art and entertains audiences.<br /><br />The last time I can remember seeing this flick, I was either passing through ship's berthing, or somebody's apartment in San Diego. I don't remember ever seeing this movie from start to finish until three weeks ago. It was always a vague montage in my head: one character getting shot by an energy weapon (the scene isn't half as gory as I remember it being), another fellow smarting \\"stick around\\" to somebody he just impaled, bad guys flying through the air as gasoline erupts around them-you know, typical \\"R\\"-rate machismo. Watching it on DVD was like watching it for the first time.<br /><br />Somebody organized the DVD material into easily accessible, thematic menus. But the bonus material teases more than informs. None of the documentaries take time to explain anything; they play like additional advertising for the movie. We see the usual backslapping and brownnosing of cast and crewmembers. And we glimpse the cast and crew at work. We also hear tantalizing slips about the differences between the original script and the theatrical cut, about the development of the special effects, and about the filmmaker's creative vision. Nothing elaborates, and it all sounds as if the documentary makers assumed that the details were either boring or common knowledge. As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I want to know about the rating board challenges, studio interference, and technical difficulties. I already own the movie; you don't need to advertise it anymore.<br /><br />Then there's the director's commentary. Consumers know trouble when a director begins with \\"Wow! I haven't seen this movie in a looong time! I've forgotten about this stuff up at the front end\\". Still, Mr. McTiernan seems to elaborate most about the filmmaking experience. For example, he points out real thermal vision devices couldn't simulate the Predator's point-of-view because the jungle itself was hot. He had to go under the table and get a private video editing company to make up the effects at the last minute.<br /><br />The effects still hold up for something supposedly jury-rigged 17 years ago and so *Predator* stands as an arch-type of the big special effect film. The thermal vision looks great, the cloaking device top-notch; only the shots of the Predator leaping from tree to tree look a little dated. Heavy amounts of sparks and smoke trails make explosions look better than even modern CGI films can manage. And then there are the weapons causing these explosions...<br /><br />Watching *Predator* re-introduced me to \\"Ol' Painless\\": a fantastic and highly influential weapon of fiction. Alongside the \\"M56 Smartgun\\" from *Aliens*, Ol' Painless represents the `80's action movie sensibility for Big F'n Guns. Actors Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke take turns wielding this compact electric gatling gun against generic Hispanic rebels and the titular villain. And wield it they did, the weapon spewing 7.62mm NATO blanks into a corona of fire. And at the audience as well; being the distinct weapon of Ventura's character \\"Blain\\", Ol' Painless marks the entire movie for the brief period of time it is seen and used.<br /><br />As a child and later a teen, this hand-held weapon was utterly believable. On into adulthood I thought the weapon not only could exist, but did. It sure sold other artists. Once *Terminator 2* made the final sale with its own minigun, almost every computer shooting game made since at least 1992 has its own version of Ol' Painless-especially id Software games. Many films since *Predator* practically scream for a chance to cap off a few thousand rounds with a rotary gun; *The Matrix* and *We Were Soldiers* even use it appropriately, mounted to a helicopter and everything. Sure, some films used M134s and derivatives before. *Apocalypse Now*, *King Kong*, *Dune*, and *Running Man* come to mind. *Predator* gave this weapon its first true due on screen.<br /><br />It also gives action/suspense movies their due. Coming along after James Cameron's *Aliens* and *John Carpenter's The Thing*, *Predator* just kicks tail. It's the tale of America's top hostage rescue team rendered impotent by a ghostly monster. It begins with macho swagger and fat cigars and Teflon characters, and ends with almost all the heroes greased, the jungle smoked, and the lead hero slumped and staring. The Predator itself surely counts as one of the more unique and powerful critters in Hollywood's halls. Being the studio film McTiernan cut his teeth on before he took *Die Hard* to the bank, *Predator* benefits from his sensibilities. It also introduced America to a director who just about defined late `80's and early `90's big top action films.<br /><br />McTiernan action films seem to work because he understands an audience's visceral needs. He injects a modicum of humanity into frames full of shootouts and explosions. Die Hard exemplifies the lighter touches that make the action easier to swallow, like his hero cop repeatedly encountering a Christmas swimsuit pinup, or scrunching his toes against carpet to relieve the stress of flying. McTiernan did it first in Predator.<br /><br />What sells *Predator* as much as the invisible plasma casting villain and steroid-enhanced one-liners are the outrageous but utterly understandable character quirks. Like the terrible girlfriend jokes, the mouthfuls of chew, and friendship between Ventura and Duke's characters. Schwartzenegger and Weather's characters have a mutual past turned into a sour present, and their conflict helps to fill scenes that would otherwise just be a bunch of guys running around the jungle.<br /><br />However cheap the effort and cardboard the characters, this film and its accoutrements have a natural head-shaking charm other films either lack or force. It boasts iconic weapons and a truly formidable enemy presented by well-weathered effects. As far as big eighties action/horror/suspense/special effect films go, *Predator* is a film to catch and appreciate.e. *Apocalypse Now*, *King Kong*, *Dune*, and *Running Man* come to mind. *Predator* gave this weapon its first true due on screen. <br /> <br />It also gives action/suspense movies their due.

B0006FFRW0|5.0|My name's Jonny.  Nine Inch Nails has been my favorite band since I was 12, when the first Downward Spiral came out.  Now it's been re-released in Dolby Digital Surround Sound and High Resolution Surround Sound, both of which are in 5.1.  Do yourself a favor, get a set of surround sound speakers (mine cost $50) and GET THIS ALBUM! you can play it on any dvd player on the dvd side in 5.1 or 2.0 (or most cd players if you play the stereo 2.0 cd side). <br /> <br />The only negative thing I can possibly say about this re-release is that since all the sounds were so cleaned up and separated into 6 channels (including the sub-woofer), it sounds a little cleaner and less mangled than the original, which to me was always part of its charm.  However, if you're like me you should already have the original of this to listen to whenever you miss the chunky collision of 8 or 9 sounds at once. <br /> <br />This album has come alive.  Instead of sounding like one band working together, the dualdisc version of this album sounds like a half-dozen or so seperate things coming together and making some eerie kind of sound; some bizarre collaboration of noise and music.  There were at least 7 or 8 songs in which I heard 4 or 5 sounds I'd NEVER heard before, and I've listened to the original version literally thousands of times. <br /> <br />One of the best examples of the use of remastering and surround sound is actually in Closer.  That chainsaw-kinda sound near the end starts in the front left speaker and makes a full circle around you (front left, rear left, rear right, front right) and blends perfectly in almost 360 degrees.  Everything is cleaner and spread out and like you've never heard it before. <br /> <br />A word on techie stuff.  CD's are generally recorded at 16-bit quality with 44100khz, 2 channels (left and right).  This version of The Downward Spiral was recorded (or so claims my dvd-audio player) at 48000khz with 24-bit quality and 6 channels (front left, front right,rear left, rear right, center and subwoofer). <br /> <br />Besides everything new on this album (this version also includes three music videos, better artwork on the book, an image gallery, and a discography), The Downward Spiral is in and of itself an amazing CD.  It's an industrial-rock concept album about the main character's life falling apart, piece by piece.  Great instrumentation, great songwriting, great lyrics.   <br /> <br />Buy this album folks.  Cheap at twice the price.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|But I certainly resent the \\" Not bad for a skinny English white boy\\" attitude one reviewer portrays this as.  If you want to make this a racial battle, go march with some krazed whacked group that does their krazed whacked group thing.  Don't write trash about a \\"skinny white boy\\".  Blues Purist.   Jazz Purist. don't give me that crap.  One may not like Kenny G but favor Coltrane, and one may not like Clapton but favors Robert Johnson.  I like jazz too, and dislike Kenny G.  I like Clapton and Robert Johnson.  There is no stereotype, and I thouroughly condemn that hypocritical myopic perception.  If you are a \\"BLUES PURIST\\", have an open mind.  <br />      As for this CD, I find it a little weaker than From the Cradle.  To me, I could turn on From the Cradle and get a variety of variations on the blues progressions.  This CD is not bad, but it's a little repititous.  I particularily like Hell Hound on my Trail, If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day, Little Queen Of Spades, 32-20 Blues, When You Got A Good Friend, and Stop Breakin' Down Blues.  Those are the highlights to me. It is not a strong CD, I admit it.  If one is looking for a blues CD, take From the Cradle over this or Riding with the Kid.  All in all, I find the CD to be listenable but not outstanding. <br /> <br />NOTE TO ALL BLUES PURISTS:  I'M NOT ONE. <br />  <br />       <br />
B00008WT5C|5.0|So, is this the best AC/DC album? Hmmm...a hard claim to make...but out of all their albums, I think this is easily the rawest, most kick-ass album they ever did. And this is precisely why you must have this album. I love the polished, poppier side of the band like Highway to Hell and parts of Back in Black too. But Let There Be Rock ALWAYS leaves my balls black and blue, and screaming for more! Guitar players, BUY THIS ALBUM if you haven't already. The tone is killer! Listen to the guitar solos in \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\"!
B0006399FS|1.0|Ran out and got this CD for $10 the first day it was released.  Even at that bargin price, I feel that it wasn't worth the drive to the store.  I see that it's breaking sales records, but I can't figure why.  Being such a long time U2 fan I feel that if they can't do better than this, they should stay out of the studio and just tour on the basis of their old hits.
B000067J1H|5.0|When I saw this movie I was shocked, I definitely wasn't expecting it to be a exhilarating ride as it was. <br />I thought it was just about fights and lots of violence plus Brad Pitt and Ed Norton in it, wrong! <br /> <br />Those who feel angry at the world and the culture of massive consumers will identify with this flick. <br />This isn't just fights and blood, it's a look at the anti-social persona, the things we do to feel okay with ourselves and the way we lose control and let someone else think for ourselves and tell us what to do...we become followers and we don't even know what we're following. <br /> <br />This film is not gonna be enjoyed by everyone, this isn't a film you watch with the family, it is a good psychological drama more than an action film, highly recommended.
B000002UAX|5.0|A Doll's House was the original working title for The Beatles (White Album), and I think the record is so eclectic that it does reflect a doll's house of images and emotions, but I think they did the right thing by simply naming it after themselves. Simply put, this album is \\"The Beatles.\\" Not the Beatles with George Martin. Just the Beatles. Raw, adventurous, and human. This is not the perfect production like Pepper or Abbey Road. Although those are both great albums too, this is a different experience. And the Beatles had a different experience making it. The songs were mostly written when they were in India, when they had real peace and quiet for the first time since they became famous. John Lennon had not written a block of material this solid since Rubber Soul, which is mostly his record. Paul shines more on Revolver and Pepper. Here, it's pretty even, and George has four songs as well, plus Ringo writes his first original for the band. So this record truly is \\"The Beatles.\\" But again, John Lennon is very strong here. Dear Prudence, Happiness Is a Warm Gun (which was Paul's favorite song on the record), I'm So Tired, Julia, Yer Blues, Sexy Sadie, Revolution 1. Those are seven bona fide Lennon classics right there. He really came out of his LSD shell when he met Yoko, and these songs were his first burst of activity after that life changing experience.     But in closing, this record has a homey, lived-in ambience. It's real, it's raw. Ringo got pissed off and quit the band for a few days, then came back. Yoko was around. These guys were being real, letting their guard down, and it translates into the music. Sure, each composer seems to be doing his own thing, but that's what it was. The White Album is what happened when you stripped away the layers, the Sgt. Pepper suits, the fancy cover design, the George Martin production style, the editing and pruning, and were simply left with an unmarked white cover on a self-titled double album made by The Beatles, putting down the songs as they felt them right then and there, polished or not. It's an accurate and authentic snapshot of the band when the record was made. Late 1968 was a time when people's nerves were rubbed a little raw, and this record reflects that reality. I stand in awe of Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road as studio masterpieces. But with the White Album, I feel like I know these guys, like I'm sitting in the room with them. The Beatles were not gods, they were four guys who had life issues and also made great music. This record has its share of \\"filler,\\" and so does life. Life NEEDS filler. You can't have perfectly crafted statements all the time, you need those little moments where someone says something goofy or nasty. And I'll take Beatles filler over just about anyone else's.       If you don't have this, what are you waiting for?
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth's Damnation 2003 release showcases the band's amazing versatility, and is a more mellow album in terms of vocals and instrumentation.  Akerfeldt has a great voice and the musicianship in the band is undoubtedly laudable. The best track on this album is \\"Windowpane.\\" I strongly recommend this even if you are not an Opeth or heavy/death-metal fan.
0375751513|4.0|Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.<br /><br />The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.<br /><br />The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life.  As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I wouldrank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side.t I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds.

B0000019PA|5.0|What an album, trying to put into words what this cd does to your heart is not possible. The first time I heard Holland 1945 I felt like I recieved a kick in the stomach. The happiness of the music mixed with the beauty and depth of his lyrics. From start to finish this record is a journey of the innocence lost in men. A must listen to anyone that finds more in music than just catchy hooks and recognizable lyrics.
068987474X|2.0|Anyone that has had a serious relationship should find this humorous, but simplistic.<br /><br />It's all common sense, and not any sort of stellar epiphany within these series of case studies represented by supposed letters from 'women' such as 'Nikki' who seems like the most lobotomized female I have ever read about.<br /><br />If you have had a relationship of any kind, have self-esteem, or are over the age of 17, you should already realize that ACTIONS are what matter, and that men are not that complicated.<br /><br />I recommend that you buy \\"Date Like a Man\\" or \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" as those are hilarious as well, and while also not really telling anything new, contains useful behavior modification techniques for the lay person. ;-)

B000056QE5|1.0|Just a word to everyone out there.  I saw \\"Mary Poppins\\" in 1964, and bought its Original Soundtrack Album on Vista Records (a subsidiary of Disney).  That album's score was not taken directly from the movie soundtrack (as this \\"restored\\" CD release is).  Instead, bits of music and dialogue were included in the LP to make for better segues; the \\"Overture\\" ends in an entirely different fashion; the biggest damage was done to \\"Supercali...\\" where the musical intro has been omitted as well as the comical dialogue in the middle of the song. The sound engineers have stripped out all the charm and warmth of the original Soundtrack version, and yet they call it a \\"Restored\\" or \\"Remastered\\" version. This is why I continue to play the vinyl version (transferred to CD). And frankly, there is no reason to include all 8 minutes of \\"Step In Time.\\"  If you want all 8 minutes, just watch the DVD -- like every other song, that's where they lifted the music for this CD.

6304936303|4.0|THE LAST BOY SCOUT is filled with the kind of throw away plot and sometimes clever dialogue of LETHAL WEAPON's Shane Black, and the over the top action sequences Tony Scott does so well.  Add the eternal down and out cop, Bruce Willis, and you have the makings of a vile, but entertaining, thriller.  Damon Wayans is miscast as the \\"buddy\\" of Willis.  He doesn't look or act like a football player and his self-pitying monologues get repetitious and whiny.  Danielle Harris as Bruce's daughter does a fantastic job, but what a foul mouth!  Chelsea Field is lovely as Bruce's unfaithful wife.  Halle Berry in her pre-Oscar days looks nice, but has the range of Suzanne Somers in this early role.  Noble Willingham is effective as the football magnate; Taylor Negro is slimy as the head executioner, and Joe Santos does his gruff cop again for the billionth time.  It's all set to some marvelous action pieces and some good one-liners.  Willis' hero in this one is definitely not an idol, but the movie delivers what you expect.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This film has been neglected long enough....Romero fans , our time has come!  Past DVD versions have come devoid of any special features, sans trailers.  Now we get everything one could hope for in one package.  The film speaks for itself, a isolationist end of the world fantasy drenched in cartoonish gore.  As many of you have pointed out, this is not so much a horror film as it is a vision of one society breaking down and another rising up, and how fundamentaly they are not that different.   <br />   The great thing about this incarnation of the late 70's classic is how much extra we get.  All the main actors and Romero give incredibly entertaining commentary tracks (you'll laugh out loud at the actors' track), everyone is present and accounted for in the feature length doc which takes you through every section of the film, and you'll be fascinated to watch the differences in each of the three versions of the film presented here.  My favorite is of course the extended edition, but I digress.  There is even a tour of the Monroeville Mall conducted by actor Ken Foree that also features other cast members from the film.  The most surprising feature is a short commercial for the Monroeville Mall, circa 1977-78 that is just about as creepy as the feature film. <br />   If you're on the fence about this one, get off and buy it already!  There is about three days worth of viewing material on here if you take it one disk at a time..its worth every penny.  This is the real Dawn of the Dead, except no imitations OR remakes!
B000002H6C|5.0|This is definitely Metallica's peak.  Overall, &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; are just barely better than this album but there's something about it that is very intriguing.  Metallica fully showed their potential on this album.  1) This is how you follow up an album like MOP.  2) Every song is consistent and takes on a new direction.  3) Name a song where Kirk Hammett doesnt play a kickass solo.<br />1.  Blackened. 10/10 What an opener! Very fast and some kickass riffing towards the end.  Sets the standards for the rest of the album.<br />2.  And Justice For All. 10/10 Don't complain if it drags on too long.  Metallica are the only band who could make a song like this.<br />3.  Eye of the Beholder. 10/10 I don't see whats wrong with the beginning.  Awesome solos around 5 minutes into the song.<br />4.  One. 11/10 Best song on the album. Best song of Metallica's career.  Enough said.<br />5.  The Shortest Straw. 9/10 Good song but I tend to enjoy it less because &quot;One&quot; is before it.<br />6.  Harvester of Sorrow. 10/10 Only 5:42. Second shortest song on the album but kickass.<br />7.  Frayed Ends Of Sanity. 9/10 What the hell is up with the beginning? It gets better though.<br />8.  To Live Is To Die. 10/10 An EPIC Metallica instrumental in tribute to Cliff Burton.<br />9.  Dyers Eve. 10/10 Arguably Lars Ulrich's best song ever. Just listen to him on drums. Great way to close it out.
B0000041ZT|5.0|Who knew Shostakovich had such a sense of humor? This disc is delightfully entertaining and sparkles a the turn-of-the century cosmopolitan sound that is simultaneously reminiscent of Milhaud, Gershwin, and Ibert. The result is something supremely different. It's certainly worth a listen or two.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Truly bizarre. And surprisingly romantic. This was a very strange and very tall tale that incorporates a sweet and subtle reminder to cherish the one(s) you love. Good for some laughs, and some very unique story-within-a-story-within-a-story recall. A rather entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Not every tall tale is a complete fabrication, and through the most elaborate webs, a lifetime of memories can be woven (and remembered, and passed on). This is a gem worth seeing. Lose yourself in someone else's fantasy for a while.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love this CD!!! It's the best of Shania in one GREAT cd, no more flipping thru CD's to hear most of my favorite songs, as I can hear most of them on this CD.  Plus, I love Party for 2, that song is a great song....If you're a Shania fan, or just enjoy her music, I strongly reccomend this CD, as it will be well worth the money, and a pleasure to listen to! :)
B00005JM0B|4.0|A continuation, if not the end of the Terminator franchise. An exceptionally descructive movie. With all the money they put into the effects, they should've saved just a bit for writers to sweeten the plot. Many inconsistancies and a stiff performance by most. That said, I think this was pretty good. Amazing effects, end of the world theme (could it happen? could machines take over, kill off the human race?), Arnold in possibly his last movie. I don't like how it just, *ends* but it's an incredible ending. And as final an ending as it seems, there's a little hint of hope (just to tease us probably). As with the other two (T1, T2), T3 is a fast paced ride with lots of edge of your seat action. All that's missing (well, one thing I missed anyway) is Linda Hamilton.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This was the first Nightwish album I bought, and is still my favorite.  It rocks, is very well produced, and does a terrific job balancing heavy guitars with epic-sounding orchestral parts. It also helps that the lead singer has a fantastic voice.  If you're new to this kind of music, this is a good place to start.
B00000ILBK|1.0|The \\"mighter-than-thou\\" crew of the USS Enterprise decide that they know better than the entire Federation Council (including the Vulcans) and override the decision to remove the _non-native_ Ba'ku from their _non-native_ planet.  Humph!  The audacity of the Council!  Remove these handful of vagabonds so that the planet can be used to save the lives of wounded Federation defenders from a genocidal race that wishes the erratication of all Alpha-Quadrant beings??  Ridiculous!!  Now, let's have cheesy love scenes, crappy special effects and a horrendously CGI-rendered Enterprise-E debut and call it a Trek movie!! <br /> <br />Rent this movie for 99 cents...DON'T buy it.
B000024D4R|4.0|I find it discouraging  to disparage Pink Floyd's efforts, but their releases must be judged by a higher standard than most other artists.  I say this because Pink Floyd simply sets the bar higher for themselves.  They aspire to the same sort of artistic challenge that only bands such as The Moody Blues, The Beatles, or The Who have aspired to.  'Animals', like The Who's 'Tommy', the Moody's 'Days of Future Passed', and The Beatle's 'Sgt. Peppers' tackles a formidible, high-minded topic: the impact capitalism has on human nature.  Roger Waters and company (primarily David Gilmour, who adds lead guitar throughout and gets credit for composing the music to 'Dogs') are taking on something on a scale few other rock musicians would even conceive of, let alone risk their images and careers on.  They probably deserve four stars just for being a notch above the teeming mass of rockers, but their effort isn't without flaws. <br /> <br />Water's expose is based on two foundations, 1) the anthropomorphizing of people, symbolically casting them as dogs (ruthless scavengers), pigs (greedy, pompous charades [pronounced with two short a's]), and sheep (the mindless masses, used and abused by the dogs and pigs), and 2) Water's underlying socialist philosophy, and indictment of capitalism as the force driving people into these sterotypical roles.  Waters presumably was inspired by George Orwell's 'Animal Farm', which portrays people as possessing these animalistic characters, and which also is a scathing commentary on the 'dog eat dog' premise some associate with capitalism. <br /> <br />While the analogies are fun to play with, they are of course shallow stereotypes.  I have difficulty imaging most of the people I know as fitting into these simplistic packages.  I do however find it much more compelling to visualize myself on all three diminesions, since at times we all possess the character profiles outlined by Waters.  So rather than applying the human critiques externally to theworld around me, I find it much more legitimate to view all three personality types as dimensions of my own internal ego.  I don't believe this is what Water's had in mind, however, especially since at least two of the 'Pigs' were fashioned after real people, one being Margaret Thatcher.  So I may be distorting the message to my own uses, but so be it. <br /> <br />Musically, I find 'Animals' to be one of the least distinguished in Pink Floyd's catalog.  Though it did well on the charts, topping out at number three in the US and number two in the UK, none of the compositions seem especially 'catchy', such as 'Money' or 'Breathe' from 'Dark Side of the Moon', or 'Fearless' from 'Meddle'.  Gone is nearly all of the psychedelic influences as well, with most of the music being acoustic ballads (the opening and closing 'Pigs on the wing') or straight ahead rock (all the remaining tracks).  With disco and punk-rock knocking on the door, the sounds of psychedelia were hopelessly passe in early 1977 when 'Animals' was released.  'Pigs' is the finest song in the lot, with the most engaging melody, and timely use of the talk-box to alter its texture. <br /> <br />Along with it's predecessor, 'Wish You Were Here', 'Animals' is fraught with pessimism.  Dogs are man's best friend, pigs are intelligent, and sheep are soft, cuddly and peaceful, but these redeeming qualities are of no use to Water's here, and so they get eaten up by the stereotyping.  While 'Animals' possesses a compelling premise, indulging in this philosophy as a framework or mindset is bound to be depressing, not to mention being too selective in the reality one is willing to consider.  Waters makes it far too easy to criticize 'Animals' for playing to the crowd who see the glass as half empty. <br /> <br />One nice feature of the CD is the creative and humorous combination of the huge inflatable pig cast in photographs against the backdrop of the Battersea Power Station in England.  Together with the handwritten lyrics, it's a very engaging booklet to peruse as you take in the soundtrack.  Do some internet research on stories behind the development of this pig shoot for some interesting reading.  'Animals' is certainly a must for avid fans of Pink Floyd, but for more casual fans it is only on the cusp of collectability.
B0000025F7|5.0|I have been a fan of Mike for a very long time, but I hadn't listened to this album completely, just the major tracks mostly. I just recently bought it and by the time the final track finished, I was still shaking my head in utter disbelief. I have never seen such a wonderful display of talent and more talent than in Michael. From the opening smash to BURN THIS DISCO OUT, every song is wonderful. My personal favorites are:  <br /> <br />1) Get On the Floor - a truly powerful disco tune that I would not hesitate to play in a dance club. This song just makes you want to get out there and dance like there's no tomorrow! <br /> <br />2) Girlfriend - a very cool song; somewhat corny, but very fun. <br /> <br />3) She's Out of My Life - a very moving song, this is Michael at his emotional best. <br /> <br />4) I Can't Help It - a very good song, with Stevie's genius behind it. Michael and Stevie? We have a winning combination here! <br /> <br />5) It's the Falling in Love - Michael and Patti on a song together. I was so excited when I seen her name on the song's notes. The two perform this awesome duet. <br /> <br />Aside from my personal five favorites, the other five songs are just as excellent. Get this CD because Mike does not and will not disappoint.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Before I begin, I'm going to quote some of the other reviews given: <br /> <br />\\"the singer is really ugly and this band is just sooooo bad!! go buy an avril lavigne cd, shes like the biggest thing rite now, and sooo talented and pretty!!!\\" <br /> <br />\\"I had to literally hold back vomit 10 seconds into this cd. I was afraid that I had somehow been infected by this trash and had to cleanse myself by listening to N*Sync. Only people trying to look sophisticated will buy this album. (look at meeee. I listen to radiohead...I'm sooooo coool!!) Thom Yorke tries so hard to imitate Avril Lavigne, yet fails so miserably. If you want a good album, buy any of N*Sync, Justin, Britney, Avril...you know, good music. I would give this a negative infinity stars if I could.\\" <br /> <br />Both of these reviews were 1 star.  If you are going to rate this amazing cd 1 star by all means, go ahead.  In fact I would enjoy seeing the other side of opinions on this album, but if you are going to lower this albums rating use your brain.  Don't post mindless garbage, insulting the album, yourself, and anyone reading these reviews.  You're pointlessly canceling out well thought out 5 star reviews.  If you enjoy Justin Timberlake, listen to Timberlake.  Usher, Nelly, 98 , New Kids on the Block.  There ya go, review those. <br /> <br />I apologize for ranting on, but thats something I had to say, and it goes for many of the classic albums rated at Amazon.  As for the actual album, it's breathtaking, stunning, worthy of adjectives not yet created.  Wheres a poet when you need one; I'm at a loss for words.  If I were asked to change a single moment of this hour long masterpiece I could not.  It would be a crime for a single song to be changed in any way.  Hail to the OK Computer.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's third album, OK Computer, was until recently, an album I did not like. I bought the CD for \\"Karma Police\\" and also enjoyed \\"Electioneering\\" \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" and \\"Lucky,\\" but did not really understand the rest of the record.  <br /> <br />My friend, Kayla, however, told me about how great it was and she said it was something that you ought to listen to from start to finish. I tried this, and by the time \\"Karma Police\\" blared from the stereo, I was taken. See, I was listening to it incorrectly. It must be played start to end, without skipping tracks to find your favorite track (most likely \\"Karma\\"). It is Radiohead's album and not yours. Listen to it while dusting or washing dishes and then, you will get it.  <br /> <br />\\"Hey...man...slow...down,\\" Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke, howls repeatedly, imploringly, at the very end of the last track on \\"OK Computer.\\" It's a place worth getting to, the end of that album, and something worth listening to, carefully.
B00005JKC3|3.0|This movie is funny as hell. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, and I went in there as a comic fan expecting to see a serious adaptation of the comic books. What I got instead was a 1950s B-Movie for the new millenium. There's a scene in this movie where Bruce Banner is locked up and talking to his dad. His dad all of a sudden starts ranting about how the military is conquering everything in its path, which had nothing to do with anything. While he's talking, Banner starts screaming for no apparent reason. I laughed my ass off during that scene.  <br /> <br />This is the funniest movie of the year. Guaranteed.
B000000OAL|4.0|Queen's debut album. Thirty years ago! I almost saw them on this tour open up for Mott the Hoople, but they cancelled at the last minute. What a memorable double-bill that would have been! This is a very ambitious album even by Queen standards. I would describe it as progressive metal. There are tons of Brian May's patented guitar overdubs creating groundbreaking guitar harmonies like no one else has ever done. There are three songs that got radio play, Son & Daughter, Keep Yourself Alive and the first song I ever heard by them, Liar. This album would be a great choice to be remastered.
0393035158|5.0|This is one of the most profound and straightforward indictments of supernatural thinking that I've ever read. There are a lot of authors who take on the absurdities of mainstream religion, but books that cut to the quick with this degree of lucidity are rare. \\"The End of Faith\\" has quotable material on nearly every page. Moreover, Harris' reasoning is so astute and so devastating to mainstream nonsense that Publishers Weekly has described \\"The End of Faith\\" as a \\"sometimes simplistic and misguided book\\" and then, they feint astonishment that Harris doubts the \\"rationality\\" of \\"faith.\\"  Considering the new age drivel that these folks praise routinely, Harris should take this criticism as badge of honor.  Intellectually, America is an adolescent country which makes \\"The End of Faith\\" a book for grownups.  I think Sam Harris has the potential to be the Robert Ingersoll of the 21st century. Highly recommended.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am 21 years of age and have been a U2 fan since 1998.I have been reading several reviews and alot of them are complaining on how the tracks in HTDAAB are so drastically different from the single Vertigo and how one guy felt jipped because he was dissapointed that every song didnt sound like vertigo. I am sure the guy that was dissapointed was on his way to pick up the new Eminem cd and had heard a song called Vertigo by some band called U2 and had just decided to pick it up. ANYWAY what i am trying to say is if you are anykind of fan of U2 wouldnt you realize that having a cd with extremely upbeat songs like Vertigo would pretty much gop against what U2 is all about. What i mean is every U2 cd has had only a very slim number of loud upbeat songs and they have always toned it down later in their cd's and thats why so many millions of people Love U2, they make music from their heart they dont simply put a loud upbeat track behind crappy lyrics they pick the sound for what suits their feelings that that are expressing in their words. Not that i wam saying that every U2 cd has been completely mellow i mean if you look at it early U2 (Under a blood red sky, Boy etc) were all very upbeat albums. It wasnt until the 90's where U2 really started to mix their mellow and upbeat songs together. But to get back to the new album. I dont know what the hell these other people were listening to but when they said that this wasnt a rock album they must have completely gone deaf when Love Peace or Else and All because of you were playing. Prob my favorite tracks on the cd is City of blinding lights, a truly beautiful song that is a blast to crank up in the car and let the top down and cruise the streets in the evening. The song Kite was one of my favorite tracks off of the all that you cant leave behind cd and a song that is similar in lyrics off of the new album Sometimes you cant make it on your own is becoming one of my all time favorites. One thing i learned is that sometimes you cant make it on yourown has been sitting around for a few years which gets me excited, i mean if a song as beautiful as that has just been sitting on the shelf for a few years i cant imagine what else they have just sitting around. The song All Because of You took a lil getting used to but i came to realize that this song is so raw and good it can stand toe to toe with any 20 something garage band on the radio today.  This is another beautiful work of art by U2 and in a time when any crap can make it on the radio U2 will have no problem whatsoever dropping the atomic bomb on the rest of the crap and once again proving to the world they are and will always will be a Bad Ass rock and roll act from Ireland.u cant make it on yourown has been sitting around for a few years which gets me excited, i mean if a song as beautiful as that has just been sitting on the shelf for a few years i cant imagine what else they have just sitting around.

B00003XB8K|4.0|The melodies on this CD seem to be more cohesive and enjoyable to chill to than those on their 3rd cd (Le Roi).  Smell of Desire is easily my favorite and qualifies as one of the best dark/ambient tracks in my collection.  I don't much care for the Carmina Burana stuff laced throughout a few of the songs as I think it clashes with the moody relaxed atmosphere Enigma is so good at creating.  As with the previous few CD's, Cretu's vocals are less than impressive, but they don't appear that often on this CD.  Push the Limits, Traces, and Endless Quest are also very relaxing.  You won't find anything of the caliber of Sadeness or Return to Innocence on this CD, but it's still a good CD nonetheless.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Hands down, this is the best comedy - I'll even venture to say best ALL GENRE - movie of the year! Living in Idaho myself, the stereotypical \\"Idahoan\\" mindset/culture is A+. If you give this movie a negative review, I'll send over Pedro's cousins. WATCH THIS MOVIE - AND - BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! There are deleted scene dialogue clips in it, as well as unforgettable quips from the big screen.
014028009X|5.0|I really loved this book but not as good as the v.g. movie
B00005JN0T|5.0|This film has eye-popping visual feats, and what makes them special are the ideas and humanity behind them.  A rare sci-fi thriller that works as both science-fiction and mystery, this film is not a strict adaptation of the Asimov short stories, but its plot is truly labyrinthine, it works a specific theme, and is happy to end in a shroud of enigma.  One of the very best films of the summer, this one will continue to grow in reputation as more people see it and realize it is much more than just another \\"Will Smith summer movie.\\"  A murder mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end, spell-binding action, wonderful characters, and a CGI robot you really care about.  The ending is a classic, and despite a few unnecessary one-liners, the shocking thing is that Hollywood released such a moody piece in July, probably not realizing that the filmmakers had made something far beyond the usual popcorn flick.  See this film.  I, fan.
0385507755|5.0|James Frey blew me away with his book a million little pieces, icould not believe what i was reading, i was both irritated and overwhelmed by the context. Not knowing what addiction is in its full sense i used to give in to fear and repulsion from all addicts but here comes a pioneer addict who through his own life story takes us into the depth of an addict to reveal that the mask of courage they have on is only a cry for help and that after all they are humans. It is not just a story of addiction it is as well a love story it is about family, religion and meaning of life... Through the offensive language Frey has marked himself as a distinguished modern realist where the essence of all have been captured... I respect this author alot and i thank him from the depths of my heart.
1591840562|5.0|What a great book! OK. I confess to be a fan of Kawasaki's since his days with the Evangelista list. Nonetheless, the succinctness and clarity of this little book exceeded all my expectations. <br /> <br />This is no dry, paint by numbers business book. It cuts through the BS to the heart of the matter of what fuels the entrepreneur and how to use that fire to temper an idea into a sustainable venture. Just as importantly, he helps identify the tell tale signs that should tip off entrepreneurs that they are veering into trouble. <br /> <br />This is a how-to book that is motivated by a desire to spare all parties unpleasantness by asking the hard questions when they need to be asked and de-coding the jargon of those who don't have the courage to give the entrepreneur straight answers. <br /> <br />Regardless of the nature of the venture or process you're starting or thinking of starting, \\"The Art of The Start\\" is absolutely essential reading. This is where to go to figure out how to do it. This is where to go to find out what to look for. This is where to go to find out what to listen for. This is where to go to find out what to avoid. <br /> <br />You'll find all of that here, delivered with passion and empathy. It's an unbeatable combination for those of us seeking guidance as we create and move along a critical path.
B00009V7P8|1.0|This guy is a satire of himself. Dead serious and full of pretention, but lacking both self distance and musical talent, he just comes off as mildly amusing. This pseudo-intellectual work which some praise (and to my surprise very few dislike) rings a feeling of coffee shop music - and that's being very generous to the record. I imagine that his fanbase consists of people who are just slightly interested of the \\"alt-rock\\" scene but are nowhere near of having a genuine interest in music. Because if you had, you'd probably be aware of the fact that Damiens music is an insult to all the musicians he blatantly attempts to copy. Ignore this record and buy anything by Elliott Smith, Ryan Adams or Jeff Buckley.
B000000993|5.0|First I'd like to say, To those of you that have voted a 2-star or less for this album, All 9 of you are a pretty big force to be reckoned with...And if your too stupid to realize Tool is amazing, then your probably too stupid to realize that i'm just kidding.  <br />Undertow is a Great album, and Disgustipated (track 69) is a pretty cool thing to listen to, I'll admit that its a bit lenghty with the crickets but i like the song nontheless. And The rest of the album was awesome too (4 Degrees being my personal favorite)
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is an epic historical movie, my favorite genre.  This is just a fabulous movie.  I missed seeing it in the theater. This was because I listened to a review, that I now strongly disagree with.  That reviewer stated it wasn't very good & that Russell Crowe didn't do a good job of acting.  I disagree, I think his acting was strong, as usual.  This movie has spectacular sets & costumes.  You really don't feel as if you are watching actors in a movie.  It is more like time traveling.  I have watched it many times on DVD.  It may be a bit long for some.  But, I didn't mind the length.  It was a pleasure to watch every time.  I also enjoyed the music.  The attention to detail is extraordinary.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Between Madonna going out of her way to create controversy and the media falling over themselves in announcing the end of Madonna's career (how many times has it been over now?) and annointing a \\"new Madonna\\" every twenty seconds, it's not surprising that the American Life album was ignored for the most part.    Any attention was directed towards the laughable title track and first single. And as embarrassing as that song is, at least it's kind of catchy and entertaining.  (If I'm home alone, I find myself cranking the hokey rap part really loud)  Any artist who can still inspire a reaction other than boredom 20+ years into their career must be doing something right.  That being said, \\"Hollywood\\" is probably the best cure for insomnia ever released.    So we've gotten past the two underwhelming singles.  What's left?  Just some of the best songs she's ever recorded.  Call this You Can't Dance: most of the songs are stark acoustic numbers with minimalist electronica leftover from Music.    But on \\"Love Profusion\\" \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" she proves she can be compelling as a writer and performer without gimmicks, distracting production or muscley disco.  And she's nice enough to throw in \\"Die Another Day\\", the excellent 007 theme song that's heavy on all of the above.    It's totally out of place, but American Life isn't a consistent album anyway.      But with the sorry state pop music is in, it's mindboggling that American Life is not embraced for the spotty but quality work that it is.  Madonna's worst is still much better than most new \\"artists\\" best work.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Let me say this is #2 on the my list of the greatest 130 WWE DVD's.  This is a great PPV that just fell short of the Monday Night War.  This is the best PPV you could have ordered.   <br /> <br />Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle was awesome I was jumping up and down and Eddie pulled it off. <br /> <br />Undertaker vs. Kane was a very scary match and I thought that Kane had set the fans up but it wasn't fake it was very real when Kane got tombstoned. <br /> <br />Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit <br />           This was the greatest match in WrestleMania history period.  HBK cuts himself like he killed himself.  Benoit makes HHH tap out to become the new champ. <br /> <br />Overall this DVD is awesome pick it up and there's a lot more action on there.  <br />
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley in my eyes is the most talented musician i have ever known and i think will ever know. I discovered Jeff when my older sister was playing it in her car, I immediatly asked who possessed the sweet, magical, unbelievable voice i was hearing and she replied \\"\\"Jeff Buckley.'' I quickly went out and brought live at sin-e`and Mystery White Boy i was hooked. Day and night night and day i listened to the beautiful voice of Jeff's i felt emotions like i had never before with music i finally knew that this is what music should do to you it should touch you and make you feel emotions beyond belief. I then went out and brought everything i could find, his talent was absolutely beautiful and when i learned about his death a few years before from my sister i was extemely saddened like i was when my loved ones died. He felt like an old friend, i feel like we still connect through the music. Grace is the best thing my ears have ever heard. The emotions that are conveyed through these songs and the yearning in Jeff's voice is too real to believe. Jeff has opened my eyes and ears to better music no artist has touched me in the way he does i am now into music that means something not commercial crap that i was into just a few years before. I cannot analyse all the songs but i can say every song on Grace has its own feelings, its own story. The lyrics are beautiful, touching. The melodies embrace your soul and the singer touches you and completely blows you out of the water! I cannot describe my feelings after i've listened to Grace the whole way through during this masterpiece i cry, i laugh i feel everything you can think of. I would definetely recommend this album its the best thing you can hear and feel. My favourite tracks are Lover You Should've Come Over, Grace oh hell their all my favourites. I especially like the lyrics in Lover You Should've Come Over ''She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever.\\" I would recommend every Jeff Buckley album except Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk it is good, but very raw. I just cannot believe that his mother Mary Guibert in all her attempts to achieve more money from her sons death released it Jeff would of been turning violently in his Grave. I think what she did was so disrespectful beyond belief that's the worst thing you can do release a work in progress, i for one thing refuse to listen to it again it is raw, unfinished and disrespectful. If it were finished it would be absoutely wonderful maybe as good as Grace maybe better. But in my eyes Grace is the best thing ever! God bless you Jeff, may you rest in peace my dear Friend.
B0000024R8|4.0|This is Bob at his unplugged best, wailing on the harmonica and playing his version of white-boy blues and folk. The recording is a little flat and sounds a little like Alan Lomax's hotel-room blues records, but Dylan shines through on this charming first album. If you are just discovering Dylan, you should probably start with  the Greatest Hits albums or Another Side, Highway 61, Bringing It all Back Home and John Wesley Harding, but if you wish to hear Bleecker Bob exploring his roots, you have to own this one.
0385508417|5.0|The plot is a little scary- razy neighbors only interested in a Christmas display, but there's heart and the book doesnt go overboard. Two things I cant say about the movie. I kinda wish Krank was a lawyer- it'd be more Grishamish.
B00030590I|5.0|First of all let me clarify something, this is NOT a QUENTON TARENTINO movie. \\"Hero\\" is a foreign film, that came out originally in 1999 but was brought just now to the US thanks in large part to QT (who loved the film and thought US audiences would too).<br /><br />Hero is set in china during it's \\"warring states\\" period. During this time, China was not a united country as we know it today, but consisted of 6 or so smaller kingdoms which were almost always at war with one another. Then the king of Qin (chin) attained military supremecy and began to ruthlessly conquer his neighbors, swallowing up all the kingdoms of china \\"like a silk worm gobbles up mulbury leaves\\". The king of Qin then proclaimed himself \\"Shi Huang Di\\" China's First emperor... china as we know it is born of this empire.<br /><br />The story is full of twists and is told in a Roshomon style (showing different perspectives of the story until we finally arive at the truth). The entire movie is really a conversation between the King Of Qin and a bounty hunter who has killed 3 assassins from the rival state of Zhou that were trying to kill the king. The Hero, tells the king his stories of how he defeated each, and the story takes a few twists.<br /><br />Our Hero, and his opponents all possess almost super-natural kung fu powers. And the fights are utterly amazing. The fight scenes and martial arts choreography are OUT OF THIS WORLD. In fact they're so over the top that many might find them \\"silly\\". But this is supposed to be more of a legend or a myth than a story based in reality and that should allow you to watch on with awe at thier powers rather than chuckling at seeing men walk on water or fly through the air.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Jet Li and all the others do an OUTSTANDING job! This combined with amazing vivid visuals and innovative use of striking color give Hero a very complex and heartfelt emotional depth that other movies are lacking now a days. Everything from the diologue to the story to the acting to the fabulous soundtrack is touching and moving.<br /><br />Amazing visuals, great cinematography, a wonderful score, excellent actors and a deep and engaging story... what more do you want? One word summurizes this film - FANTASTIC... in every possible sense of the word. Those just wanting a kung Fu Swordplay movie with some crazy fight scenes will get more than they could have possibly hoped for. Those wanting a deep and engaging historically based epic will also be pleased. And the passion with which this film was finely crafted ensures that it touches on every emotional aspect of life - love, hate, peace, war, passion, dedication, compassion, regret... you name it. You dont just watch this movie, you feel it - so those seeking a movie with depth and meaning behind it and a real story to tell should look no further than hero. It's a martial arts historical epic that has many levels and layers and you can come away from Hero with as much as you are willing to look for in it. A GREAT movie. a big big 5 stars.
B0000027I6|5.0|\\"Amused To Death\\" is one of the very few albums I never get tired of. I've had it for the full 12 years since it was released in '92 and love it more and more with each listen.  It takes a few listens to get into, but once it does it never gets old.  <br /> <br />This, by far the best of Waters's three solo albums, holds its own with Pink Floyd's best work. Its provocative and insightful lyrics weave in and out of a eerie, Floydian musical atmosphere. From the individual human cost of war--a soldier trying in vain to carry his dying comrade out of no man's land--to the inhuman, video-game like nature of bombing others from out of range--the album both whispers and screams.  <br /> <br />And it seems more relevant than ever. Waters's briliantly cynical take on the entertainment value of military action in the First Gulf War makes me hopeful that he will return any day with a follow-up musical commentary on Gulf War II.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Ah, finally!  Another review by me!  How bout that?  Been quite a long time since I've written a review for Amazon.com, and finally I've written something that will rock with your head and eat your soul like my others.  Here's a review I've put off writing for quite awhile because I really wanted to wait for the hype to die down.  And after reading so many different viewpoints on this website and others, it's caused quite a stir indeed.  Well, here we go.<br /><br />The film largely follows that of the catholic faith's \\"Stations of the Cross\\" and while I'm not too entirely familiar with it, I know that it details the \\"passion\\" (literally meaning \\"suffering\\") of Jesus Christ and finally being nailed on the cross.  Mel Gibson himself is catholic and had this idea incubating in his head for years and I'll tell you what, this film really got to me.  It's wondrous cinematography (remember the film The Black Stallion?  Same guy!), authentic languages of Aramaic and Latin (which by the way, Aramaic was used by the common people, Latin by the Romans.  Just thought you'd find that interesting.), and the wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus.  I previously saw him in \\"Frequency\\" and already knew he was a good actor, but this movie proved that he is indeed a GREAT actor.  Monica Bellucci, who played in the Matrix films and played a whore in that stupid \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" film, is Mary Magdalene here and also turns in a fine performance here.<br /><br />Gibson actually did some nice artistic touches here, especially with the flashbacks.  I think this is where some Christians get pissed off because he took a few liberties.  Example: in the Bible when Jesus is tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane, we see Satan (presumably) tempting him to not fulfill the prophecy.  While the Bible never outright says it is Satan, I found it very plausible.  Satan is regarded as the evil spirit, or the fallen angel, who tempts us through sin.  It would seem very likely to me that Satan wouldn't want Jesus to die for us.  Gibson also used the \\"original sin\\" idea, showing Satan with the ugly baby, and also with Judas being shameful and eventually killing himself for what he had done.<br /><br />My only complaint with this is I wanted to see a little more to the resurrection than we saw.  I wanted to see everyone's faces when they would see Jesus alive and well.  Oh well, I guess.  After all, no matter how well you make a religious film, it can't be perfect (and plus, that wasn't really the focus of this film).<br /><br />So why did it affect me like it did?  Well, I may be the strong religious person that I am (and loves heavy metal, how about that?), but in growing up in the Protestant faith, I never really concentrated on Jesus' suffering; after all, without the resurrection, it would've been a moot point.  However, when watching the film, all I could really think of was \\"He did THAT for me?\\"  I never really thought about what he went through, and this film changed my thinking forever.  I'm not sure if I would outright tell you to see this movie because it's very graphic and poignant; however, if you do, I HIGHLY suggest you watch it with an open mind because I've known people to hate it just because of their opinions on what the Bible is and so forth.  If you don't like the film because of its graphic nature, then you are well in your right.  If you don't like it based on your preconceptions of what Jesus went through or it disagrees with your religious opinion (for example, I have a friend who didn't like it just because he thought Jesus was totally human and not spiritually the \\"Son of God\\" and therefore could not live during the crucifixion.), then that is simply your opinion but I still can't help but feel like you are allowing those preconceptions to override the fact that this is indeed just a film, and the filmmaker is showing his deepest love for Christ.<br /><br />It's not a film for everybody to enjoyand even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.  But it quite possibly might have been the most influential film I've ever seen in my life.  While my faith first and foremost comes from the Scriptures, this film still makes a profound impact for me and you have to respect Mel Gibson for doing what he did.to enjoy and even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.

B0006A9FMI|5.0|There is indeed a story here, and a detailed one at that, but Oshii approaches filmaking differently than most.  His style may throw some people and I could see how viewers might think this is random psycho-bable and pretty colors.  However, just because its not your cup of tea doesn't mean you should say its not a good movie.  Sometimes a movie's meaning falls on deaf ears because they expect a more traditional film setup (and I think the first Ghost in the Shell was far more traditional).
B00004BZ16|5.0|This album may be compared to the Beatles White Album, because like the White album, it contains the bands biggest variety. This album contains more than variety; it contains so much variety you would never guess this album songs are even the same band. First off if you're expecting something like their debut look elsewhere; nothing on this album is similar to any past releases, and actually sounds like a completely different band. It is sprawled over with every style imaginable, and the fact is that because they actully pulled it off it is genius. This is the Clash's least excessible album, much more than london calling, and may be hard for some to listen to because it's not a quick album to pop in for some backround noise. It's focused, and extremely experimental, and is without a doubt a masterpiece that no one knows about. What's more amazing is that a band such as The clash who made London Calling could completely change dierections and be even more incredible. For the people who are used to an easy listen, this is not for you. But for those who really like to delve deep into albums, this complex masterpiece will make you quite happy.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The opening minute or so of this film is quite sickeningly cynical. We see Will Smith's character Del Spooner getting out of bed. We see his morning routine, his shower. The camerawork is all about the muscles. We then see him lovingly and slowly unwrapping a box with a set of trainers inside. To settles any doubt a few minutes later he is dropping the brand name and describing them as `vintage 2004' (The movie is set in 2035.) So that there's no room for doubt. The first minute or so is not an opening sequence to the movie `I Robot' at all. It's just a commercial. How badly does that suck?  <br /> <br />If you don't switch off in disgust at that point what do you get? Well you get a variation on the theme of machinery we humans are given to making getting smarter and smarter and starting to get dangerously insubordinate. We've been there before of course in `2001', in `Blade Runner', in the `Terminator' franchise and plenty else. Isaac Azimov however was there long before any of these guys, coming up with the short stories this film takes its name from back in the `40s. In fact Azimov was decidedly sympathetic to his robots imaginary paternalistic insubordination. But we get none of that here. Indeed what we get here retains almost nothing of the Azimov book except a broad theme and the names of a couple of characters.  <br /> <br />A striking feature of Azimov's work is that it really is *science* fiction informed as it was by a vast knowledge of science. So it's a pity to find the science-talk that floats around here is such laughable mumbo jumbo, idiotic word-surfing with woefully misappropriated talk of `the ghost in the machine' and `free radicals'. (Just to be clear, `the ghost in the machine' was a metaphor invented by Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle to characterise what he considered the `Cartesian myth' of a private inner world of consciousness, while `free radical' is a fundamental concept in modern molecular chemistry that has absolutely bugger all to dowith free will.) Hollywood has engaged remarkably little with the huge corpus of Asimov's science fiction and it's sad to see such dumbing down on a rare occasion when they do.  <br /> <br />Mainly it's a cgi fest much of it like watching a cartoon. The action sequences, notably the one where Smith is attacked in his car and the climactic one stretched my capacity to suspend disbelief way past breaking point and were a bit tedious. Smith's character is probably not intended to come across as obnoxious, arrogant and thoroughly dislikeable but it does. Chi McBride isn't bad in the clichd part of the maverick cop's long-suffering, running out of patience boss. Bridget Moynahan is weak in the clichd part of the rather frosty-seeming woman scientist type who turns out to have emotions after all. All three are out-acted by a cgi robot.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. This is all entertaining enough. If you want a dumb popcorn movie that more or less does what it says on the tin that is exactly what this is. <br /> <br />
B0000024UO|5.0|Great album--better than I expected. I saw Johnny live about 12-13 years ago, and I've bought a later album or two over the years, but I didn't realize how great he was back in the late sixties until after hearing this album. Not only is his guitar playing phenomenal, but I love his vocals as well, especially on \\"Drown In My Own Tears\\"--absolutely superb. The man can croon the blues with the best of 'em! I highly recommend this album along with his re-released Second Winter as well.
0399103422|5.0|I don't get why everyone likes the movie so much more.  This book contains subplots that were vastly important, but that the movie lacked.  Johnny Fontane's struggles were heart-wrenching.  Santino's girlfriend, and the doctor were a perfect diversion.  And the cop turn hit-man was a wonderful look into what must have happened to Luca Brasi.  And this Godfather is not a thinly veiled thug like the one Marlon Brando played.  He's a caring person, who sometimes has to have people killed for what he sees as the greater good.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is actually the best selling independent label album ever. If you like 90's rock/punk you should definitely chek this out! <br /> <br />1. Time To Relax: Just an intro to the cd. <br /> <br />2. Nitro: Great song. Very fast paced.  8/10 <br /> <br />3. Bad Habit: This song is hilarious!!! I love the line, \\"When I go driving I stay in my lane, but getting cut off it makes me insane.\\"  The guitar riff rocks too. But if you're against cuss words, you might not like the ending of this song..... 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Gotta Get Away: This songs starts out slow, but the chorus is awesome! 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Genocide: This is probably one of the most punk songs ever made. It's very loud and fast! The guitar riffs rule! 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Something To Believe In: Another great song. This song has a meaning to it. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. Come Out And Play: This was The Offspring's first big hit. It's a sarcastic look on school violence. A funny, but truthful song. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Self Esteem: Basically a song about a guy with no self esteem. The guitar riff is similar to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana. Great Song. The Drumming is awesome!  10/10 <br /> <br />9. It'll Be A Long Time: Another great song with a great meaning. This song is about how the world is messed up and that it'll be a long time before it gets to how it should be. \\"When will the world listen to reason? I've a feeling It'll be a long time...\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Killboy Powerhead: This is an annoying song. If you listen to this once, it will get stuck in your head for the rest of the day! It's still cool though. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. What Happened To You?: This is The Offspring's first ska-like song. It's about a guy who used to be smart until he started taking drugs.It's also funny song. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. So Alone: One of their shortest songs! It's also very punk like. 6/10 <br /> <br />13. Not The One: This is another song that has a meaning to it. It is also about how messed up the world is, but they are complaining that the younger people are being blamed for how messed up everything is, even though it's not entirely their fault. Great Song. 9/10 <br /> <br />14. Smash: This is an against authority song. You can tell by the lines, \\"Do what I want, do what I feel like.\\" Great for all punk lovers. If you keep this song running for about 5 minutes after it ends you can hear an acoustic version of Come Out And Play 9/10
B0001UL7RY|3.0|This album doesn't really introduce a new side of Avril at least in the attitude of her songs, but definitely a more professional side, great vocals on this album compared to Let Go. But songs like Take Me Away and Slipped Away seem unfinished, and don't feel complete, but songs like Nobody's Home, My Happy Ending, and Don't Tell Me, do introduce at lighter and very fun side, Let Go was a little bit more fun to listen to, people who liked but didn't love Let Go, probably won't like this, but anyone who loved Let Go will appreciate the effort on this album.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is the offspring's highest selling album. I can see why: <br /> <br />1. Welcome: A very short intro. <br /> <br />2. Have You Ever: A great song! I love the ending, \\"The truth about the world is that crime does pay...\\" It also mixes in with Staring At The Sun if you listen carefully.  10/10 <br /> <br />3. Staring At The Sun: This is my favorite song on this CD. The beginning guitar riff is really cool. The lyrics are cool too.  10/10 <br /> <br />4. Pretty Fly: Some people love this song, some people hate this song. Personally, I like it. The guitar riff is awesome and the lyrics are funny. I don't know why some people don't like this. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright: This is an awesome song. It talks about a neighborhood of people who were hopeful as kids, but then messed up as adults.  9/10 <br /> <br />6. Feelings: This is a cover of the Moris Albert song \\"Feelings\\" but they add a few things to it. Instead of saying, \\"trying to get rid of these feelings of love,\\" They say \\"Feelings of hate.\\" And they mess with the song in other various ways. They also added an awesome guitar solo. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. She's Got Issues: This is where they started to go a little poppy. I don't like this song that much. But it is kind of funny. The girl in the music video is hot. 6/10 <br /> <br />8. Walla Walla: This is a song about a prison. It makes me laugh when I hear the line in this song, \\"I didn't do it, I didn't do nothing man...This is bull----. He just gave it to me....it...it was a present..\\"  7/10 <br /> <br />9. The End of the Line: Now we're back to the more rockish type of The Offspring. The End of the Line is a similar song to \\"Gone Away\\" (on their Ixnay on the Hombre Album). It is about a person who died and how the other person is dealing with it. It's a great song!!! 10/10 <br /> <br />10. No Brakes: This is a great punkish song. Just like the title, this song is fast with no stopping or slowing down! 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Why Don't You GetA Job: It's kind of weird how they put this poppy song right after a big punk song....oh well...The video for this song is weird.....The song itself is okay... 7/10 <br /> <br />12. Americana: This is a nice song about how messed up the United States are.It's actually pretty much true. 9/10 <br /> <br />13. Pay The Man: This is an 8 minute song that's slow for the first 4 minutes and fast for the last 4 minutes. I really like it. If you wait for about a minute or two after the song ends you can hear a Mexican version of Pretty Fly. 8/10 <br />
B00067BBQE|4.0|I'm going to mention 2 cons to this live album before getting to the many pros, and that's the song number, since Evanescence has only one album out, they don't have the large selection of songs like Linkin Park or Hoobastank, so they are limited in a great way, and they can't give too much new material away. Another one is the setting, they are performing in too dark of a place. <br /> <br />Pros though, it's live, Evanescence sounds great on this live album, Amy Lee gives it her all in front of the camera, and anyone who has ever been to a Evanescence concert knows that Amy Lee is a great singer but not doesn't do well live, but during this, she gives a great deal of effort to maintain her great voice. Bring Me To Life is my favorite live track, it's so wonderfully done. Evanescence does well.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to Green Day since 1994 and I have to say that this is definitely Green Day's best CD. This album is a rock opera, all of the songs go together in a story type thing. <br /> <br />1. American Idiot: Great opening for this album!This song describes how messed up life is today. It is also the first single from this album. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia: This is a 9 minute song made up of 5 different songs, but it is very catchy. They mixed the songs in it just right. They introduce the character Jesus of Suburbia in this song. The only part of this song that I don't like that much is \\"I Don't Care\\" 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Holiday: This is my favorite song on the album. It's basically against all authority! It also mixes in with the next song. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams: This song mixes in at the beginning with \\"Holiday\\", It is the 2nd single off of this album. This is a great song. I liked it the first time I heard it!  10/10 <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting: I don't really like this song that much. It's too slow and they just repeat \\"Are We We Are, Are We We Are The Waiting Unknown,\\" a bunch of times in between verses. 5/10 <br /> <br />6. St.Jimmy: This is a fast punk song. I really like it. In thi8s song they introduce the character St.Jimmy. The chorus and guitar riffs are awesome! 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine: At first I didn't like this song. But after listening to it a few times I started to really like it. The chorus is awesome. This song makes you think....it has a big meaning to it. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel: This song is a fast paced song that starts the second the slower song before it ends. They almost mix right into each other. This is where they introduce the character Whatsername. She comes up in a few of the following songs including the song \\"Whatsername\\" of course!  9/10 <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl: This is also a song about Whatsername. It's good, but not as good as She's ARebel. The drums are weird at the beginning.  8/10 <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb: Letterbomb is a song about a letter sent to St.Jimmy from Whatsername. I really like this song. It's very catchy.  9/10 <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends: I love this song. It's got a really good meaning to it. It starts out slow, but after they do the chorus it gets fast and stays fast and loud the rest of the song. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. Homecoming: Another 9 minute song made of 5 different songs. I like this one better than Jesus of Suburbia because I think the songs are more catchy, but there still is one song I don't like in this, \\"Nobody Likes You\\", It's too slow for me. But all of the other songs within this song are very good. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Whatsername: Another slow song, but it's very good. I think this song was a very good song to make as the end of the CD. 10/10
B000002H6C|5.0|Right off the bat, I know i'll be slammed for proclaiming And Justice for All the best album Metallica ever produced. Yes, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning and (without a doubt) Kill 'Em All are simply a thrash metal historian's bible but And Justice for All is where everything clicked. What makes And Justice such a monumental achievement is that despite the death of Cliff Burton, the band produced their most cohesive and creative record in the group's history. The tracks meld perfectly from one to the next. James Hetfield's vocals are in top form here as is his guitar playing. Hetfield's lyric on Eye of the Beholder \\"you can do it your own way, if it's done just how I say\\" pretty much sums up not only his type A personality but cements his status as the unquestioned leader of Metallica. Lars turns in a career making performance here especially on Blackened and Shortest Straw. Kirk Hammett's guitar playing is virtually flawless especially his solo's on One and the title track. Jason Newstead steps into some huge boots to fill but does so more than admirably. There are no throwaway tracks on this album but some of the standouts include Eye of the Beholder, Shortest Straw, Harvester of Sorrow and Frayed Ends of Sanity. This is an absolute must-own for any self respecting metal fan and in my opinion the best work of Metallica's career....my how far they have fallen since...Highest Recommendation.
B000002BPS|5.0|This is my favorite offspring album. It has 14 great tracks! <br /> <br />1. Disclaimer: A funny intro to the cd. <br /> <br />2. The Meaning of Life: I really like this song. It's got a great guaitar riff and chorus. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Mota: Mota is spanish for weed, just to let you know. The beginning of this song is awesome because of the drum and guitar intro. This is weird song. Some strage guy yells MOTA!! After the choruses. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Me & My Old Lady: This is a song about a guy and his wife. They act like the don't get along but they actually do (or something like that) 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Cool To Hate: Here's the part of the CD where the really good songs start to come in. Cool to hate is about a guy that pretty much hates everything. So he lists them for you.... 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Leave It Behind: This is an often unnoticed song. Not many people realize how great it is. I think it's just because it's short and is in the middle of the CD, and it is followed by one of the greatest songs ever written...9/10 <br /> <br />7. Gone Away: This is one of The Offspring's best songs. It may possibly be one of the best songs ever written! It's a true story about how Dexter (The singer) lost his wife in a car accident, and the sadness he feels about it. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. I Choose: Another one of the best Offspring songs!!! It's about a guy who's life is messed up. The video for the song is funny! The guitar solo in this song is one of the best I've ever heard!  10/10 <br /> <br />9. Intermission: This is a funny break in the CD that gets you ready for the next song. They play \\"Tea For Two\\" with brass instruments while a guy says \\"Yeah....Intermission...\\" <br /> <br />10. All I Want: Another great song by The Offspring! It's about a guy that just wants to be left alone. The guitar riff rules!! 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Way Down The Line: This is a funny song about how kids grow up to be just like their parents!  9/10 <br /> <br />12. Don't Pick It Up: This is a ska-like song, and it's one of the funniest Offspring Songs ever! <br />The first verse is hilarious!! \\"I saw a little kid as he walked around. He picked a candy bar up off the ground. He chowed about a half then his face turned blue. Turns out that candy bar was doggy-doo.\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Amazed: This is a darker song than the one before it. It has a deep meaning. The chorus is awesome! 9/10 <br /> <br />14. Change The World: This is a good song. It's a nice way to end the CD with this fast, loud song. 9/10
B0002KVUKM|3.0|There are things about this movie that I really liked, and things that I really hated.  First let me say that when I first heard the movie was being directed by Stephen Sommers, I was really excited.  The 1999 Universal movie \\"The Mummy\\" was absolutely fantastic.  It stayed true to the original classic, but added in awesome special effects and a lot of humor.  I think that was a truly epic monster movie, it's sequel not falling far behind in terms of greatness. <br /> <br />Anyhow, now we come to \\"Van Helsing\\".  When the official website for the movie opened, I couldn't have been more pleased.  The shadowy pictures of each of the 3 monsters had me jumping out of my seat, they looked so awesome.  Being a huge fan of the classic Universal Monster movies, I was happy someone had finally decided to do a decent remake of the three monsters featured in this film.  Most of the 90's versions of Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Wolf Man (with the exception of \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", which was excellent) were really lacking.  Then finally when the trailer was released for Van Helsing, it was looking better than ever. <br /> <br />And after many months of waiting, I finally sat down in a theater to watch Van Helsing.  I was greatly disappointed.  First of all, this movie did not stay true to the original movies at all.  It actually rewrote the birth of Frankenstein.  Sure, many of the same elements existed (the castle, an angry mob, the windmill, etc.), but the story was just wrong.  Dracula was never meant to be present at the Frankensteins' Monster's birth, and Dr. Frankenstein was meant to be a mad scientist, not some symbol of good. <br /> <br />Next we come to Van Helsing himself.  Who exactly is the person portrayed in the movie?  He's obviously not Abraham Van Helsing, as portrayed in Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", but some descendant.  And why does he have to be working for the church, which only comes into play for about five minutes of the movie anyhow?  And quite frankly Idon't see why Mr. Hyde had to be stuck in the movie either.  The Mr. Hyde in this movie was a complete rip off of the one in \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman\\".  I personally, would have chosen a different monster, maybe the Gill Man or something more common in the classic Universal realm.  Anyway, I didn't particularly like Hugh Jackman as the hero either.  Don't get me wrong, Hugh Jackman is an awesome actor, but he's already Wolverine in \\"X-Men\\", and seeing as this movie is obviously some type of superhero story, I think they should have went with someone less popular.  And the whole \\"right hand of God\\" theme was really lame. <br /> <br />Next we come to The Wolf Man (my favorite monster).  First, I'm glad someone was finally able to make a decent werewolf movie, as the past few years have not seen many, but I do have some complaints.  I think the \\"first\\" werewolf to appear in the movie, the one to bite Velkan, was the best one featured.  The gray fur, and the overly large fangs looked magnificent.  And the way the creature moved was great.  But the Velkan werewolf wasn't as good, in my opinion.  It looks too much like a puppy, not nearly as feirce as the first werewolf.  Yeah, I know, it's one of the good guys who has turned into the wolf, but still it could be a little meaner.  I didn't care for the transformation sequence either.  The idea of a man tearing off his skin and revealing a wolf underneath is awesome, but its was carried out too PG-13 friendly in the movie.  You need to show the guy actually tearing his flesh away, not blend the shedding skin with the metamorphosis.  And I don't really understand the fact that when the werewolf turns back into Velkan, it also tears its skin off.  The whole idea kind of contradicts itself.  And finally, and I don't want to give away too much, but the \\"final\\" werewolf in the film was mean looking too, but it's fur was too dark, and it made the creature hard to make out.  Not to mention the monster's face resembles that of a black lab. <br /> <br />Finally we come to Dracula.  I don't think the character was carried out too well, honestly.  Dracula is meant to be evil and at the same time partially compassionate for his love, not funny.  It's good to have humor, but did Imhotep make jokes in \\"The Mummy\\"?  And I also didn't care too much for the fact that Van Helsing encountered Dracula before, and the whole \\"offspring\\" idea was a cheaply thought out excuse to bring the monsters together. <br /> <br />One last comment, what was the point of that Transylvanian guy with the top hat?  He had really lame jokes, and basically no purpose to the plot whatsoever.  I was glad to see him taken out by Velkan.  On the other hand, I think Kevin J. O'Connor added a great deal to the movie as \\"Igor\\", just as he did to \\"The Mummy\\".  He would have been satisfactory as the film's comic relief, but for some reason they had to make Dracula \\"funny\\", and add that goofy Carl guy for additional humor (a waste.) <br /> <br />So finally, the special effects were excellent, and overall the movie is very entertaining, but I just think too much money was wasted on the project.  If they wanted to remake these monsters so bad, they should have done each one seperately, and if they wanted to make a movie with these three monsters so bad, they should have done it a little more seriously, and stayed true to the original stories.  Van Helsing is basically just a seriously overproduced mix between \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and \\"Howling VI\\".
B00007ELEL|4.0|Prior to viewing the DVD, I had seen this only on TV, where the sanitizing of the language and interruptions for commercials made it both flat and incomprehensible.  Seen as it was intended, it's engaging and very, very funny. (The plot is still almost incomprehensible, but as the Coen Bros. point out in the \\"making of\\" featurette, nobody understands the plot of \\"The Big Sleep\\" either.) <br /> <br />And that's their central idea:  An LA Noir mystery, with all the plot convolutions typical of the genre, but with the added twist that the \\"detective\\" slot is filled by their stoner anti-hero, \\"the Dude\\".  Jeff Bridges' perfomance as the latter is a bent masterpiece that deserves repeated viewing. <br /> <br />I would rank \\"Lebowski\\" just below \\"Fargo\\" and \\"O Brother\\" as one of the Coen's best - - Similar in many ways to \\"Raising Arizona.\\"  As the years pass, the fact that it originally flopped at the box office just gives it more appeal as a cult classic. <br /> <br />If you like the Coen Bros. work, you must see this in its original form before you give up on it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|\\"American Life\\" recieved a lot of mix reviews, but I found most critics said the same thing about Madonna's latest album: \\"It's different\\" (as if that were a bad thing). Madonna is the queen of re-invention and always redefining her music as well as comtemporary music. In some respects, \\"American Life\\" is different, but Madonna's individuality and ability to create a well balanced album with a lot of surprisingly infectious tunes is still constant. I think she knew that \\"different\\" would be risque, but this is Madonna we're talking about! She's always pushing the envelope. My personal favorites are the bubbly \\"Hollywood,\\" the ever-so catchy \\"Love Profusion\\" (try getting that song out of your head while you're in the middle of class), the beautiful \\"Nothing Fails,\\" and the soothing lyrics of \\"Easy Ride.\\" Honestly, there aren't too many tracks on this album that I dislike too much (although \\"I'm So Stupid\\" seems a bit amateur musical and lyrical for Madonna). I think Madonna did a great job at creating an indiviual style for each track and it is very evident when you listen to all of them.

B000002G23|5.0|I think that you absolutly have to own this box if you like me grew up in the eighties. If you don't and you are a true music lover you'll love this music anyway because it is fantastic and immensly creative music, but if you are not deep into music probably you would find it dated due to some choices in the arrangement department (something that this music ain't, no matter what). This music was everywhere in the eighties and it's incredibly powerful and visionary twenty years after its release. I said powerful because it's fantastic how Police succeded in emboding an entire era of music, the eighties in their strong songs and musical ideas. The eighties was not that bad in the end for what matters to music comparing them with actual years, the Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera years where music is less exposed and important than their (quite nice by the way) bottoms! Even pop music was better in those years, there was much more melody and talents even sometimes under tons of cheap (and sometimes cheesy I admit) keyboards arrangements. Anyway this was not the case of Police music which was incredibly visionary at the time and still it is. It's something completly different ... it's very deep music with a fantastic sense of musical time and musical space, curious winner ideas. There's fantastic musicianship going on but not for the sake of, but used to reach musical goals. There are tons of creativity and charisma in the musicians and their music. By the way they were only three playing, incredible. Summer's guitar playing was so orchestrated e Sting bass lines was so right, and his voice so new and sharp ... and Copelad was truly a rhythmic master. There are visions in the Police charts, musical visions, no band in the eighties created something so different and with such musical values. Can you imagine that this music was considered pop music in the eighties and now pop music is all about nice bottoms??? Oh, what a decline !! At one point the Police was the favourite Miles Davis band and even Rush (Peart/Lee/Lifeson) favourite band. I think this thing says a lot. Musicians so prepared and different from each other loved this band to death. Me too obviously and I don't know a serious musician who don't like the Police or at least that don't find them innovative, curious, intelligent and creative. I still listen to the four magical albums contained here today, even if I'm an expert Jazz musician nowadays and I know almost everything has been recorded. Everytime I come back to these records I feel the same excitement, the same emotions, the same sense of enjoing an immense art discovery. Thinking this of the Police's music I can't do nothing but buying the full thing, with all the bonus added. I think you should do the same. This music is eternal music. I think no band in music history did so much, so good formusic health with only four albums. Four masterpieces I must say.ourite Miles Davis band and even Rush (Peart/Lee/Lifeson) favourite band.

140004281X|4.0|Seventy-three this year, Alice Munro has been publishing short story collections every three or four years for half her life. Almost as Jane Austen claimed Regency England, she has claimed modern Canada for her own fictional kingdom.      <br /> <br />It's got to that stage where the anticipation of each new title is tinged with anxiety that her powers may have diminished.  On the evidence of Runaway, she's hanging in there pretty well.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure that any one story matches much-studied Munro classics like \\"Meneseteung\\".  Taken overall, the new book could go a decent couple of rounds with The Progress of Love, the benchmark of her middle years, or Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, her previous collection.      <br /> <br />You might half expect that approaching mortality would turn Munro towards characters more her own age.  But the apparent trend is an increasing desire to draw out the final contradictions of life and family with wintry clarity.  Every story carries a blunt one-word title, almost as if she's been sampling Frederick Barthelme's story-titles.   <br /> <br />Munro doesn't stoop to special pleading.  While she can pick off the mediocre male from a hundred paces, she has no qualms about shining the harsh lights of human frailty and dissipating dignity on her own sex.  To save the day, this demanding examination is usually conducted with an intelligent, native compassion rather than distant condescension.    <br /> <br />When Sylvia forges a semi-erotic friendship with her younger rural neighbour Carla, the runaway of the title story, neither emerges with the lustre of great advances in personal honour.  The best that can be said is there is an edgy settling down, with new acknowledgments of personal weaknesses and pitfalls.   <br /> <br />\\"Runaway\\" makes telling use of, not a sacrificial lamb, but a sacrificial goat. That's mild stuff, compared with the sacrificial train passenger of \\"Chance\\", or the bleak case of mistaken identity in \\"Trespasses\\". <br /> <br />\\"Chance\\" is the first of a trilogy for the character Juliet, who takes a chance on the surviving chap (Eric) that she has met previously on the train. Look at the ironic shades of contradictory feeling that Munro quickly achieves upon their reunion: \\"He advances on her and she feels herself ransacked from top to bottom, flooded with relief, assaulted by happiness. How astonishing this is.  How close to dismay.\\"   <br /> <br />In the second story of the trilogy, where Juliet gains a daughter and misplaces Eric, Munro fleetingly appears to be channelling Flannery O'Connor, a writer she resembles not all that much. I mean, they both make effective fictional use of the halt and the lame, but Munro is untroubled by O'Connor's abiding obsession with the Holy Trinity.    <br /> <br />The trace of O'Connor is there in Munro's self-mockery, of her own predilection for unfortunate coincidences.  Juliet is regaled with the disastrous life history of someone she doesn't want to know, and this is what Munro has Juliet think: \\"When the cleft palate appeared in the story what she had really wanted to do was complain. Too much.\\"   <br /> <br />Later in the same piece, Juliet is shamed into a humiliating argument with a diabetic but determined priest. The O'Connor-like touch is that Juliet's ego and intellect are flailed by the bumbling cleric's dumb certitude.    <br /> <br />Juliet arrives at her plateau of acceptance in the third story, \\"Silence\\". She endures that universal phase of existence that Munro does well, the slippery onset of decline in our briefly (so we imagine) notable lives and the resignation that (maybe) follows.                    <br /> <br />Another long coincidence suggests Juliet's lost daughter may be alive and well.  Juliet continues to long for contact.  Typically of Munro, this hope is only to the extent that \\"people who know better hope for life after death, or for things of that sort\\". <br /> <br />\\"Passion\\" and \\"Tricks\\" are reminiscent of earlier Munro stories and their settings, the former for its scary one-day picaresque around the backblocks of small-town Ontario, the latter for its device of placing the immigrant or \\"outlandish\\" person in sharp relief against that Ontario.   <br /> <br />Like \\"Trespasses\\", \\"Tricks\\" turns on a breathtakingly cruel instance of mistaken identity.  Lest you complain, Munro has the main character remind you that Shakespeare often relied on twins and their mix-ups.      <br /> <br />Munro once pointed to the way \\"the skin of the moment can break open\\".  She likes to study momentary turning points that change lives, sometimes appearing to combine different outcomes of these turning points in the one story.      <br /> <br />The longest story and highwire act of the collection, \\"Powers\\", returns to this game.  Beginning with a routine Canadian courtship of 1927, it ends with a surreal scene in a faded hotel room of much later times, as the principal character Nancy seeks \\"not so much to live in the past as to open it up and get one good look at it\\".         <br /> <br />In between times, Nancy has loved (moderately) and lost her husband Wilf, introduced Wilf's cousin Ollie to the local psychic Tessa, and watched with utter disapproval as Ollie (who's got under Nancy's skin like a \\"low-grade fever\\") and Tessa elope.      <br /> <br />But which of their differently sketched fates have Ollie and Tessa really endured?  I'm not sure if Munro absolutely requires you to choose any particular outcome.  It is as if the different pathways may continue to co-exist in Nancy's mind.       <br /> <br />(Canberra Times, Saturday, 4 December 2004)
B000065V41|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie, we play it over, and over, and over, and over again.  I have had to start packing it away with my Christmas items, as my family would watch it WAY too much.  (There is no such thing as too much at Christmas time!)<br /><br />Watching this movie touches my heart, and my children's heart, more than getting gifts!  It is pure brilliance.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It is amazing to me that even the folks who admit to feeling manipulated by this film agree with it's premises. When I feel manipulated, I generally am suspicious and go check the facts myself. I certainly don't depend on the author's \\"Fact check\\". <br /> <br />For a great, objective review of the distortions and out-of-context \\"facts\\", do an internet search for Dave Kopel's \\"59 Deceits of Farenheit 911\\". Maybe it'll start you on the road to enlightenment.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is in no way heavy, nor are they metal.  This is really overrated, overplayed pop.  Chester sounds awful with his constant screaming, and the lyrics are poor.  If LP really wants to impress me, let them start by making an album with substance.  For example, writing more than just a bunch of songs about how they're outcasts or how they suffer from huge amounts of angst on a day-to-day basis.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I'm an avid movie lover and my favorite films include Kubrick, Mendes, Fincher, and many other films that have great substance. <br />Day After Tomorrow, I KNEW when I bought it, was just going to be a FUN, MINDLESS POPCORN MOVIE. How did I know this? That's how it was meant to me, and that's how it was Advertised. I'm not looking for the Gov't to freak about the inevitible threat of global warming AS A RESULT of sitting through this picture, because the science was created around the story. Those reviewers treating this film as though it was made to have substance, didn't, and are hugely disappointed, watched this film with different reasons and expectations. It almost would seem like someone viewing porn, and then complaining that the acting was horrible. I don't watch disaster flicks to watch Sela Ward bond with a cancer patient (Lifetime has that covered), I watch them because it's fun to watch New York get tortured by every movie in the genre. Have a nice day.
1592400876|5.0|for the english language.The author does this with bravado,leaving none of the common mistakes of the (ab)users of this wonderful cultural gift unpunished. <br />To those of honest good will,and those who like to be entertained beyond the level of Saturday Night Live,this book is a gift.
B0000048V8|5.0|I'm an 18 year old freshman in college.  I just saw this movie tonight...  for the first time ever since I was like, SIX.  I used to watch it every Christmas when I was little and seeing it again just makes me feel like I did when I was a little kid.  The animation, the music...  it all goes together PERFECTLY.  The lack of dialogue is also well appreciated, because it more effectively conveys a sense of James' emotions through smiles, frowns, and the like, rather than through what he says.  This is an AMAZING movie and I strongly encourage you to, if not buy it, WATCH it.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Love Robert Johnson.  <br />Listened to this album every day for almost a week.  <br />Tried to like it.  <br />Can't do it...it's just too flat and bland, no grit, no feeling.  <br />Clapton himself has done better Robert Johnson-covers than these lifeless songs. And Peter Green's two RJ-albums blow this one out of the water and into the stratosphere. <br /> <br />What's the opposite of memorable? Oh, right. Forgettable. This album is thoroughly forgettable. Take your man Ron's word for it and pick up some REAL RJ instead.
B0002F6BRE|1.0|This movie wasn't even remotely funny. I can't believe the people who say it's a \\"smartly written, cute movie.\\" It's nothing like that! I took my kids to see it and whispered to my daughter halfway through, \\"This is horrible!\\" She agreed with me, and if a child's word (may I remind you children are what the movie was aiming at?) was against the movie, it must be horrible. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen.
0790737345|5.0|The music fits the movie perfectly. Meg Ryan and Nick Cage are both very convincing in their roles. The movie renews your belief in angels. It makes you sure that they are everywhere. For anyone who has loved someone completely or would like to be loved that way it is is the movie to own. I never get tired of watching it. Andre Braugher is excellent as is Dennis Franz. It makes you laugh, cry and gives you hope. If you don't like this film, you need a hug. If you do like this, try Phonomenon with John Travolta too. You'll love them both. My husband (who is not into \\"chick flicks\\") loves them too. They are not over-done or sappy or corny, just wonderful!!! Don't miss them!!!  <br />

B000002H70|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums The Cure eer wrote; right in the middle of their prime age. I myself found much of The Cures releases after Wish disappointing with the exceptions of Mint Car, Wrong Number, and a few others. All the way form Head On The Door the fresh new sound of The Cure rang through Wish, then was cut off after Porl Thompson and Boris Williams jumped off the train which had gained such great momentum.                                                                                                                                but i'll stop here  BUY BUY BUY
B0006399FS|4.0|It may be true that the only reason Paul David Hewson calls himself \\"Bono\\" is because \\"the Pope\\" was already taken. Seriously, when was the last time he addressed the Edge by his given name (Dave Evans)? As Bono commands Dave (alright, it is awkward) to \\"turn it up loud, captain\\" at the start of \\"Vertigo,\\" one gets the feeling that this Irish foursome ditched their birth certificates years ago. They may just be the one human band capable of such abandonment, though; after minor flirtation with sonic electro-pop in the mid-nineties (which only yielded \\"The Sweetest Thing\\"), the boys dug up their 80s-rock strap-ons for the refreshing All That You Can't Leave Behind set. That album, as vastly popular and war-distraught as Bruce Springsteen's The Rising, reaffirmed beliefs that U2 is best with swaggering guitars (kudos to Edge), hedonistically political lyrics (nice work, Bono) and a decidedly chugging rhythm section (make sure the other two guys get their paychecks). <br /> <br />Besides-who is going to stop them? U2 is the first band to have a limited edition iPod. They're the first band to win back-to-back Record of the Year awards at the Grammies, for two songs from the same album (\\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Walk On,\\" respectively). Hell, when Bono helicopter-spun his fingers into a double encore on Saturday Night Live, no meager comedian was going to tell him to stop, much less act like they weren't fully enjoying every second of the reprise. The world has done everything to embrace these guys, save redesigning Mount Vernon into the five-o'clock shadowed faces of Bono, Edge, Larry, and Adam. But maybe, if such drastic actions were taken, it would be that much simpler; after all, men made of boulders surely have enough rock in their roots. <br /> <br />So How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb becomes a mere personification of rock; hard-hitting avalanches, mystifying horizons, and heavy soul-stones litter the album's landscape, making for a more natural vibe than ever achievedon the too-often-too-preachy All That You Can't Leave Behind. Take the sentimental balladry of \\"Miracle Drug.\\" A quivering string-and-guitar progression dwindles beneath an overbearing Bono, who quickly works his way into a pounding refrain, with Edge's loading-trigger guitar effects waiting to discharge until his last breath. As if by pattern, Adam and Larry kick in an almost tribal tom-tom/bass beat beneath the primal delivery, all halting for a minute to feature Edge's Wallflower-esque guitar weeps. Or, rather, to feature Edge's Wallflower-inspiring guitar weeps, for the man is trained in keen solos that use familiarity to make up for a lack in complexity. <br /> <br />Maybe U2's secret is their ability to glorify the effortless. Throughout HTDAAB, one can almost hum the hooks before they hit, only because the music is so predictable. So, following in suit, there's very little separating \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" from its predecessor, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\" Edge's breezy guitar winds play precursor to a wailing piano riff, all allowing an enticing thesis from Bono, which he jazzes up a little more than Clapton did: \\"You look so beautiful tonight.\\" But, one might ask, what about the blinding lights? Don't worry-Bono wears enough sunglasses for an army.  <br /> <br />Much of this album, then, is U2 playing music they know they can't f**k up. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" shows how good they are at those rise-fall crescendos. Bono's high-pitched blue-baby soul works well here, in a fitting tribute to his dead father, but not as well as the band's continual motion, slowing down a heartbeat's highs and lows and translating it into sound. The fuzz-thrash of \\"Love and War or Else\\" is surprisingly bluesy; the best piece to that effect since \\"Desire\\" from the scattershot Rattle and Hum collection. And it is during this song when Bono blueprints U2 from here on out. <br /> <br />\\"Lay down, lay down,\\" he begs of his opposite, proving that after twenty-odd years of world domination, he's learned one thing: love is submission. On \\"Vertigo,\\" U2's best lead-off single since \\"Mysterious Ways,\\" Bono culminates in one statement amidst the aero-dynamic guitar riffs and drum-kicked power chords (which both have foundation in ATYCLB's \\"Elevation\\"). \\"Your love is teaching me how to kneel,\\" he croons. For one to love U2, one must accept, without question, anything that is produced; metaphorically speaking, if you will, one must eat the crumbs from the table. \\"I kneel `cause I want you some more,\\" Bono sings in \\"Yahweh,\\" this time speaking to God. <br /> <br />How easily that puts things into perspective! Perhaps U2 is...God? They are the longest running band since the Stones, and have maybe an even more consistent track record. They do stand for everything that's anything; peace, no war, and tranquility. Regardless of their heavenly status, though, HTDAAB has some brainwashing effect, some convincing factor that only permits submission to the holier-than-thou status of the band. And when Che Guevara said that it is better to die standing than to live on your knees, he certainly wasn't talking about U2 fans.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXXM|2.0|I should have learned a long time ago to never watch a movie after having read the book. Well, I did it once again and was disappointed. That does not make this a bad movie, just a movie that has very little in common with the book, so I was confused nearly from the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />A man with two bullet holes is discovered floating in the ocean. When the man wakes up he has no memory. Why is he in the ocean? Who shot him? Who is he? He follows clues, including a clue to a bank account implanted under his skin, and learns that he may be Jason Bourne. However, he also learns that he may be someone else. He also learns that he may be an assassin.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie has Matt Damon trying to keep alive and periodically killing people to do so. However, while his nemesis in the original Robert Ludlum novel was Carlos the Jackal, and he did his very best to avoid killing the spies from his side sent to kill him because they thought he might be a traitor, in the movie there is no Carlos and everyone with a gun he encounters is out to kill him. In substitute for Carlos the Jackal is Treadstone, which was a secret project to field highly trained assassins.<br /><br />The action in this movie is reasonably good, with the requisite chases and fights. However, given that Jason Bourne was a highly trained and expensive assassin, I kept thinking that Treadstone would try harder to find and recover him rather than continually sending people with guns after him. But, just like watching a movie after reading the book, some action movies should not be analyzed, just watched.<br /><br />Jason Bourne was written by Ludlum as a tormented man who hated the thought that he might be an assassin, in spite of the mounting evidence that he was a ruthless murderer. Jason Bourne in this movie is a cold-blooded killer. He is not tormented, just efficient. I struggled to see how Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) could take a liking to Jason. Jason did show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.<br /><br />As an action movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is above average. However, I thought Jason Bourne was too cold-blooded. I thought Bourne's motivations for killing were thin initially. After killing the first agent or two the others were definitely out to get him, but you have to wonder how much of that was his own doing. \\"The Bourne Identity\\" has lots of action, but very little compassion; lots of adrenaline, but very little heart. For a better rounded story, read the book instead.show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.  <br /> <br />As an action movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is above average.

B00004SCX6|4.0|This follow-up to Britney's debut is essentially more of the same. The good news? The singles are even catchier than they were on her first album and even the filler is far from bad. The bad news? No real surprises on this album, and the best material is all in the first half of the album. Regardless, any fan of Britney is going to love this album because these songs are a big part of the reason Britney has had more than 15 minutes of fame. \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" continues her tradition (granted this only makes it a two album tradition) of naming her album after the album's strongest cut. The title track this time around might well be even catchier than \\"...Baby, One More Time.\\" The other singles (\\"Lucky,\\" and \\"Stronger\\") are also among the strongest of Britney's career to date. Other songs such as \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" and \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" are songs you might not hear on the radio, but once you buy the album they will be stuck in your head for days. I also quite like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" and \\"One Kiss From You.\\" The last few tracks of the album are the least memorable, though you have to keep in mind this is a Britney album, so they are still catchier than some of the singles you'll hear from inferior pop artists. Of these, my favorite is \\"Can't Make You Love Me.\\" The only song on the album that one might conceivably pick out as a low point is Britney's cover of the Rolling Stone's \\"Satisfaction.\\" It's not that it isn't catchy (it is), but I wish Britney wouldn't mess with classic rock. A song like that couldn't have been improved upon, so why try? To sum it up, for Britney fans, this CD is an absolute must. It isn't her best (that honor goes to 2001's \\"Britney\\"), but it is a step up from \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" and it does contain some singles that even she has yet to match and is well worth the price you'll pay for it.
B00005MP58|5.0|As a fan of this movie who can actually spell Jane Austen's last name (i.e. informed), I'll toss my opinion into the mix.  Or perhaps lack of mix, as all of the reviews seem to be good.<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion, after watching many adaptations of books, that only Peter Jackson and the BBC should be allowed to make them.  Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but I particularly like the BBC's adaptations because they aren't afraid to make them over two hours.<br /><br />This adaptation cuts no corners, removes no plot elements or even minor characters.  Most of the dialog is straight from the book and the casting is perfect--the characters seemed to have stepped from the pages of Austen's masterpiece.<br /><br />The BBC's Pride & Prejudice proves that an adaptation CAN convey all of the wit and emotion of the book without adding in corny lines or extra plot twists to keep clueless modern viewers who haven't read the book entertained.<br /><br />The much-adored Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle of course play their roles to perfection, but the rest of the cast is equally stellar.<br /><br />Particularly brilliant are David Bamber, who plays the fumbling and obsequious Mr. Collins; Barbara Leigh-Hunt, who plays the condescending and interfering Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Alison Steadman as the nervous, shrill Mrs. Bennet; and Benjamin Whitrow playing the flippant, likeable Mr. Bennet.<br /><br />However, even the minor characters are perfect in their minor peculiarities: Mr. Hurst, always to be found sleeping; Mary Bennet, plain and philosophizing; even Anne de Bourgh, without a line of dialog, manages to look as if she stepped from Austen's text.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone and everyone.  Well, maybe not, but I've practically never heard a complaint about it.  A thoroughly enjoyable movie with the bonus of being faithful to the text.
B00031TXBI|5.0|I have been a John Frusciante fan for quite sometime and I think that he is by far one of the most influential musician of all time. I was looking foward for an album that was as layered as Shadows or To Record but when you listent to this album, you come to realize that It is a beautiful piece of work.  It has such a 70's feel to it and his vocal are very clear in the CD. Initially, I listened to it and put it away because I was expecting more layers. But I brought it back out and I have been listening to it NON STOP!!!! I CANT GET ENOUGH!!! My favorite songs are \\"Look On\\" and \\"Scratches\\" but overall JOHN IS A GENIOUS!!!
B0006284JQ|5.0|I think the only reason why so many people \\"hate\\" Britney is because they never liked her from the start.  I remember when ..Baby One More Time came out, and even then tons of people called her a \\"slut\\" and that they didn't like her music.  The reason why people are so mean now is because they're tired of her songs always being a hit, always being #1 on TRL and played on the radio nonstop.  And I can see why!!  If there was an artist I didn't like that was ALWAYS on the radio, I'd be annoyed to. <br /> <br />So, if you lliked Britney from the start like I did, you'll certainly love her now.  There are also lots of people who didn't start liking her until she \\"matured.\\"  Even then, it's hard not to enjoy her early pop anthems.
B000050X31|1.0|Having just seen the Colin Davis production, this one does'nt come near it. The singing was terrible by Pappageno, and Tamino was a wet lettuce, as for the Queen of the night no feeling in her singing at all. Kathleen Battle was the only half decent singer. The accoustics were appalling. The costumes robin hood men in tights come to mind it gave us a good laugh. Pappagena what was that a munchkin. Do not buy this  it is truly awful
1400082773|5.0|I starting reading this book about 7 years ago when I was in college.  Due to time constraints, I never finished it.  However, I recently found the time to pick it up again and realized that I could not put it down.  Even though I am a Mexican-American woman, I found so much of my story in what I was reading.  As a child of immigrants, I often longed for that recognition of me in my predominantly Caucasian surroundings.  It wasn't until my first trip \\"home\\" that I fully understood myself and culture.  What a wonderful journey to relive through the words of one our great Illinois (and national) leaders.
B0000020C4|5.0|For those who want every bit of the musical, get the Complete Sumphonic Recording.  For those who want the most riveting performances, this is THE recording to get.  It has the best actors (Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, the amazing Lea Salonga, and many more), the exciting atmosphere of a live concert, and the memorable, added musical number from the different Valjeans from productions from different countries.  Worth every $!
B0002IU988|4.0|I think that this album is awesome.  What most peoples problems with Alter Bridge is that they buy their album, looking for Creed or a replacement for Creed.  But that's not what Alter Bridge is, they're their own band, and they're making their own music.  It's not like Creed, because it's not supposed to be.
0784011176|2.0|The stars and the title of this review refers to the technical side of the DVD, and NOT of the movie itself (you can read about it in other reviews here). If you want to buy this DVD, note that the DVD is very poorly organized: There is no subtitle whatsoever, and the close-caption is extremely crudely made; there's only one audio track (English); there's no in-movie control, and if you go back to the root menu for some reasons, when resumed, the movie will switch to the other viewing angle (from widescreen to fullscreen, or via versa) by itself! Best to rent it, and buy the soundtrack instead.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Awhile back when the immeasurable amount of hype floated about the airways of the radio and Television about Van Helsing and its spiffy 3D (or more affectionally named CGI) animated scenes and how practically every legendary non-scary monsters (excluding the Mummy); Dracula, The wolfman [wearwolf], Frankenstein, and Dracula's brides was going to be in this movie, I scratched my head in confusion wondering how exactly they were gonna pull this off. So after the movie came out, everyone was bellowing with all their might about how \\"horrible\\" Van Helsing was, quoting \\"Not even Hugh Jackman could save this movie.\\" Sad to say, I almost believed them until my mother rented the movie anyway.        I watched the movie with my youngest brother and I enjoyed it immensely! There was of course the occasional corny dialogue supplied by Hugh Jackman's character Gabrielle (or Van Helsing) and his Q-ish sidekick, Carl (David Wenham, \\"Lord of the rings: The Return of the King\\"), but all in all this movie was absolutely fun to watch. The plot is original as far as scary movies goes: After Van Helsing fails an assignment, on bringing back Dr. Jeckyle(?)/Hyde back to his secret organization, he and his fryer side sick is sent to Realm of Transylvania where the feared Count Dracula lives to protect the last two survivors of a  Transylvanian bloodline that swore to kill Dracula, however, he hits a snag when he meets Transylvanian princess herself, Anna Valerious (Kate Bekensale, \\"Underworld\\") who almost killed by Dracula's brides when they make an unscheduled appearance. Mr. Van Helsing comes across more trouble when he finds out that the werewolf that had been lurking about the small run-down village he and Carl traveled to is Anna's brother. While he is determined to kill the creature she continuously puts a damper in his plans. Van Helsing only find his problems escalating when he discovers that Dracula is using the wolfman to bring creatures possibly far more worse in the bittingdepartment to life, and that's where Frankenstein comes in.        Like all movies this one had its flaws, the accents in this movie were horrible but easy to laugh at it; if Hugh Jackman was supposed to have a British accent he failed miserably in that department. Kate Bekensale and Richard Roxburgh's (along with the brides) transylvanian accents were the strangest ones I've heard since \\"Count\\" Dracula's on Sesame Street (vone, two, three, haha!).           The weapons in the movie were a bit over the top but were plausible for the movie's long shaggy haired hero. On the positive side, the special affects in the movie were done nicely, I loved the scenes concerning the count's brides in their vampiric forms scooping people up off the ground in all their CGI glory, the action in Van Helsing is nonstop and downright hard not to find enjoyable, plus the ending was quite a refreshing one, a nice change. For all those who like monster movies (scary or not) and a good action flick this movie is the one to buy. ----- [a 4 out of 5]
B00005JNDX|3.0|Well, the sequel to the original Bridget Jones' Diary hasn't got an exceptional storyline. In factm it's a little run-of-the-mill kind of romantic comedy with a slightly awkward screenplay and far-fetched storyline.<br /><br />Then again, all is not lost. Renee Zewellger really lights up the screen. It's amaizng how she again put on those kilos to appear in the movie and her British slang is quite as real as it can get. Her paranoid and neurotic antics continue in Edge of Reason and she still keeps her diary but now she seems to have it all, the perfect man and the perfect job. Colin Firth reprises his role as a stern and unromantic man who manages to snarl Bridget's hear while Hugh Grant is still the philandering man who keeps up his pursuit of Bridget and ends up fighting for the lady.<br /><br />The ridiculous part of the movie, incidentally also quite enjoyable, is when Bridget is sent to a Thai jail for drug trafficking and she ends up teaching the girls sing Like A Virgin, lambasting about their bad boyfriends and giving them wonder bras. Unbelivable twist in the plot, but made enyoable by Zewellger's sponataneous acting.<br /><br />The rest of it is pretty much your usual lovely dovey stuff but it's a great movie to laugh to on a boring night.

B00006879E|5.0|This is a great CD. Adam Levine took his grief about his ex and turned that into a great funky rock cd. It caters to many different tastes, from rock in \\"harder to breathe\\" to funk in \\"This Love\\". A must have for all music lovers!
B000005E60|4.0|While I do agree that the Bernstein recording of Berio's masterwork is the better performance of the two, Boulez brings a nouance to his conducting that I think can only come from the fact that the piece had aged somewhat by the time he was conducting it.  The piece might be viewed as less topical by that time, but Boulez manages to make it speak to a new audience with the same force that it had the first time it was performed.  I personally feel that it is just as meaningful now as ever, regardless of who performs it, but Boulez definitely makes it feel avant garde, even after so much time has passed. <br />Leaving all the qualitative discussion aside, this recording is available while Bernstein's is not (unless you happen to be lucky enough to know someone with the LP), and this recording includes the additional fifth movement while Bernstein's does not.  I agree that Bernstein's should be made available no matter what one might think about its quality, but this recording is at least equally deserving of a listen.  I do not agree with the previous reviewer that the sound quality is lacking, so even if one loves the other recording, one should be able to buy this one as well without worrying about getting a badly-produced recording.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|Like a lot of people I too was looking foward to the DVD release.  It went out of print so when I found one before the anniversary edition I couldn't wait to watch it.  What a disapointment!  Overlong, Overdone, and overdruged!  Pacino is not suited to play this role.  He loses his cuban accent so often I don't know why he bothered to try.  Depalma's (mis)direction is confusing, Michelle Phieffer is just eye (or nose) candy, and its too campy for its own good.  Everyone I know seems to love this movie, but I just don't get it.  It's no \\"Goodfellas.\\"  Still, it has enough blood, gore, drugs, sex and a terrific musical score to keep interest.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|If you want to hear Robert Johnson songs, get Robert Johnson. <br /> <br /> While there are some good versions of his songs by other people, a whole album of them by anyone else is boring and pedantic. This effort is not horrible, but it isn't particularly compelling for a lot of reasons. Eric Clapton's only claim to greatness is as a blues guitarist, and the guitar work here is good but not great.  <br /> <br /> The vast majority of the people who buy this, at least in the US, are going to be people that not only do not own the originals, but may have never heard them. It's a ridiculous situation. Don't be ridiculous-get the real thing first. If you don't love them, you'd be utterly wasting your money on this anyway.
0783226845|5.0|Certain times studios \\"create\\" a role so an actor can win an oscar.  Such a movie is this.  No one but Al Pacino could have done this role.  Chris O'Donnell was destined to become a major player in this star making role.  All performances are excellent.  The direction is evenly paced, and the story has several complications and conflicts throughout.  Who-ah!  I'm really suprised that didn't become a catch phrase because it certainly is catchy.  This character study is complex.  There are layers upon layers in this story that could have taken a more safe route but instead goes risky and challenging.  A powerful movie with strong performances.  Worth watching a couple of times to catch all the complexities of the characters. <br />Those offended by course language be prepared.  It is full of \\"colorful language.\\"
B00029LNHS|4.0|I think that both critics and consumers who criticize this album are in the dark.  This is one of the better albums, specifically rap/hip-hop albums of 2003-2004.  It has spawned three very popular singles, which are among the best tracks on the album (\\"HEY MAMA\\", \\"WHERE IS THE LOVE\\" f/ JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, and \\"LET'S GET IT STARTED).  Also other hits include \\"HANDS UP\\" and \\"LET'S GET RETARDED\\".  This is a solid rap album that is different from other rap acts out there.  This is definitely an above average album.  4 stars.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Quentin Tarentino's \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" is the perfect film for today's \\"trendy chic\\" movie going audience.  Casual in its violence, flashy in its visuals, and conspicuously lacking in content and theme, the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of \\"cool.\\"  Here is a film so self-consciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world (in fact, one section of the movie literally is a cartoon).  The \\"plot\\" is, essentially, one long drawn out revenge scene with Uma Thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her, her unborn child, and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding.<br /><br />Yet, what person in his right mind goes to a Tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline?  Indeed, the thing that counts in a Tarentino work is the director's obvious love for both movies and moviemaking, a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film.  \\"Kill Bill\\" is Tarentino's affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabuki-type ballet with knives and swords.  In this pastiche of ninja melodrama and Japanese anime, at least half the film's running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences, all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve.  The violence is, indeed, gory and graphic - with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood - but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesn't offend us much while we're watching it.  Thurmon doesn't have much of a chance to develop a character here, but the steel-eyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonetheless.<br /><br />Yet, for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\"  after all is said and done.  Perhaps it's the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world.  We watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement.  Perhaps, too, the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once we've left the theater.<br /><br />I suspect that this is the very effect Tarentino is going for here - that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of \\"coolness,\\" that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against.  The problem is that, while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level, we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movie`s end.  Perhaps, the completion of the story in Volume 2 will help to rectify that condition.de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\"  after all is said and done.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|If you've ever considered picking up an MJ release for your collection, this boxset is the one to buy! If you're already an MJ fan, then you have no excuse to walk away from this! <br /> <br />First -- you get all the biggest hits. ABC, I Want You Back, Ben, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Smooth Criminal, Black or White, Remember The Time, You Are Not Alone, Blood On The Dancefloor, You Rock My World... All the classics are on here. <br /> <br />Second -- you get most of the fan favorites! Some songs that are excellent, but that weren't hugely successful as singles... Songs like Wanna Be Startin' Something, Dirty Diana, Jam, Who Is It, Unbreakable, Butterflies... It's missing a few great songs, however, like Scream, Leave Me Alone, and Workin' Day And Night, to name a couple. <br /> <br />Third -- you get all new songs and demos. We've Had Enough, MJ's newest song, is excellent! Powerful and complex; the genius we've come to expect from MJ! In The Back, a groovy song with a sort of intricate simplicity. Fall Again, a beautiful ballad showing off Mike's vocal range. Sunset Driver, the funkiest track I've ever heard, all the way from the early 1980s! Beautiful Girl, On The Line, Someone Put Your Hand Out, all good ballads. We Are Here To Change The World, the theme song from the Disney 3D movie, Captain EO! It's upbeat and great to listen to! Cheater, Monkey Business, and even more! It's all amazing to hear! <br /> <br />Fourth -- The live concert DVD! One of the most energetic and mind-blowing concerts ever performed! My personal favorite out of all his tours! From the big bang of an opening with Jam, to the amazing Smooth Criminal, to the electric Workin' Day and Night, to the final, heart-stopping performance of Man In The Mirror, this is one concert not to be missed! You see some of Mike's best dancing and singing ever! <br /> <br />Fifth -- A beautifully designed booklet, featuring high quality pictures (some never-before-seen), a great text, and a complete chronicle of Mike's history up to this point! <br /> <br />So if you're thinking about picking this one up, I suggest to just go for it. Sure, it costs a bit more than a regular album, but you're not getting just one album... You're getting four, plus a DVD! And there's no better collection of Mike's material available than this boxset right here. Pick it up -- you won't be disappointed!
B00065JTBA|5.0|I am not a Bon Jovi \\"fan.\\" I have liked a few of their songs from various albums, over the years. I have to say though that this boxed set is superb. If I loved it, then a die-hard fan would have to be in ecstacy. This set has given me a real appreciation for Bon Jovi's skill as songwriter's and musicians. There are songs on this set that are friggin great and to imagine that they just didn't make the \\"grade\\" to be placed on an album just blows me away. There's not one bad song on this set. Unlike other bands' boxed sets, this is NOT a collection of remastered reissued tunes. There are songs on these 4 CDs that you can definitely hear the influences that other musicians had on Bon Jovi and can appreciate. This set is worth the price and the time to enjoy it.
B00005QJDG|3.0|The musicians are good and James Labrie is great on studio tracks.... <br /> <br />But live he is just TERRIBLE, and it's true for all the Dream Theater live albums.  (just listen to Once in a Livetime - Caught In A Web, the worst offender ever).  Get this live take for the music because it's a great buy for that, but don't expect good singing though....it's really painful to listen to him.
B00066N8JS|5.0|I am a big NIN fan since their first album.  When i started to interest in 5.1 music from SACD and DVD Audio.  I always think about NIN music would be suitable for this new 5.1 surround sound system and then my dream came true with this deluxe edition. This album will expand your imagination of this classic 1994 album. Even the bonus SACD (not just a normal CD), 'ruiner' track is one of my fav in TDS but the demo version is also very great version !!
6305907145|2.0|This movie is not unenjoyable and has several scenes that are rather cute or witty.  However, it is very far from being a decent film adaptation of the novel.  Much of the book is skipped over, which means that character development is often skipped over.  Additionally, those characters that are developed are very different in many respects from the characters of the novel.  Perhaps, in the case of Fanny, this was done to make the \\"heroine\\" more appealing to modern women, but it does change the story quite a bit.  Also, the movie seems to be rather choppy at times.  It's worth a watch, but the changes made have really detracted from the complexity and drama of the novel.

B00065GX64|5.0|After directing some of Germany's major silent films, Fritz Lang shows us new facets of his skills in this early sound film about a serial child killer.  The first few scenes already grabbed me and sent a chill down my spine:  not due to gruesome scenes of bloody violence, as we've become accustomed nowadays, but the total lack of them!  Lang succeeds perfectly in terrifying us with a simple shot of a child's unattended ball slowly rolling away, her balloon caught in overhead wires and her empty seat at the dinner table where her mother waits in vain.  There are other short, simple and striking shots like these, as well as unusual camera angles to grab your attention.  Apart from this, I also found the story itself unusual and ever more intriguing as it progresses, such as the organized crime gangs discussing the capture and elimination of the child killer in the same manner as the authorities discussed the matter.  In fact, the inadequacy of the police to find the killer allows these criminals, with the help of street beggars, to catch the killer first and hold their own trial while the police catch up!  But the morale of the story is also well expressed in the end, namely:  should such serial killers of the paedophile kind be executed or are they mentally ill and in need of hospitalization with a possibility of release after rehabilitation?  In either case, the film ends with a mother stating that we all have to pay more attention to our children's safety, and it's chilling to realize that these headline stories of the early 1930s are still just as current and poignantly distressing today as they were over 70 years ago.  This different angle on a common theme already makes \\"M\\" compelling viewing, and Peter Lorre as the baby-faced perpetrator puts in a magnificent, powerful performance at the end which had me holding my breath.  A film not easy to forget, especially with a second disc in this new edition with discussions and in-depth analysis of the film, as well as a lengthy interview with Fritz Lang; all of which are sure to have points of interest for just about everyone.
B000002JB8|3.0|I listen to this album for Memories of Blue, which is a superb example of what Vangelis does best. It's a contemplative, well orchestrated (which means not *too much* orchestration) piano piece which is adult in tone without being too melancholy or too difficult to get into. For me, it's sublime. <br /> <br />And the rest of this album is pretty bland, disappointing, department store music. As someone else said, anyone could have written this. It sounds like Vangelis discovered a sampler and forgot to do anything other than sample. Or, in the case of Sirens Whispering, it just sounds painfully, embarrassingly godawful. Song of the Seas is almost good enough, but not quite.
B000089CJI|5.0|this band is incredible. some of my favorites, are \\"from such great heights\\", \\"sleeping in\\" and \\"brand new colony\\" for anyone who is a fan of.. ahem \\"harvesting herbs\\" will enjoy this band very much.
140004281X|5.0|Several years ago, I picked up Alice Munro's collection of short stories, Open Secrets, and started reading the first story, \\"Carried Away.\\"  Over fifty pages, I experienced half a century of a woman's life and a country's history written with boldness, sweep and utter command.  By the time I finished the story, Munro had completely redefined my notions about what a short story could be.<br /><br />Munro's best work continues to astonish, and a lot of it is on display in her latest collection, Runaway.  The title story is classic Munro, which is as good as it gets.  The runaway is a young woman attempting to flee a stalled marriage, and, ultimately, figure out where she fits in the world.  The ending, which ties the fate of the girl's pet goat, also a runaway, with her own, is stunning in its rightness and emotional impact.<br /><br />\\"Passion\\" is almost as good.  A teenaged girl, Grace, takes an impulsive car ride and learns some life-altering truths about herself and about the dark currents of despair surging beneath the placid surface of her small town Canadian life.  \\"Trespasses\\" is about a younger girl carried unwillingly on the tide of adult deceptions and desires.  \\"Tricks\\" hinges on a moment of mistaken identity that changes the direction of a young nurse's life.<br /><br />The least successful part of the collection is a group of three connected stories about Juliet, a callow classics major who cuts off ties to her past, only to have her daughter do the same thing to her many years later.  The three stories have the length of a novella, but not the cohesiveness.  Nor do any the individual panels in this triptych have the resonance of Munro's best made stories.<br /><br />The story whose impact lingers longest is \\"Powers\\" which is too big in all ways to try and summarize.  Read it, and be moved by writing that seems beyond storytelling, that feels like Truth Itself.  Reading Munro at the height of her art is like listening to John Coltrane play the saxophone - there's a point where analysis breaks down and all you can do is pay homage to genius.<br /><br />Munro characters all bump up against the same defining question: do you have the courage to be who you truly are?  Her stories tend to be about small moments with big implications: those times in a life when possibilities for personal liberation either open up or close down.  Since the desire to break free from what constrains us exists within all humans, the concerns of Munro's provincial Canadian girls, though firmly grounded in a time and place, are universal in their implications.  These characters affect us so deeply because their successes and failures mirror our own.<br /><br />Only great artists achieve this kind of universality, and that level of artistry is on display in Runaways.  The collection doesn't have the sustained brilliance of Open Secrets, but what does?  You can only compare Munro to herself, because, in the realm of the short story, she has no peers.play the saxophone - there's a point where analysis breaks down and all you can do is pay homage to genius. <br /> <br />Munro characters all bump up against the same defining question: do you have the courage to be who you truly are?

B00006FDCD|5.0|My friend, her cousins, and I watched this movie at her birthday party. We accidentally watched part 2 first, but it was still really scary. I usually don't scream, but I must have screamed 30 times throughout the movie. I haven't read the book, but I loved the movie! Tim Curry does a great job as the ever scary Pennywise the clown. We were so freaked out the rest of the day and the next day. I would recommend this movie to everybody.
B00002E23E|2.0|I'm not that big of a Led Zeppelin fan at all. I never will be. However, I thought that this would open me to liking this band. It  put me back a few steps. <br /> <br />The movie starts off with a mob \\"wacking\\" (am I using that right)? A man without a face, a man that's a bear-type of thing like Star Wars, and one guy gets his head blown off and multi-colored blood squirts out of his head. Sounds like something they'd make fun of on Monty Python. Who are these people, why are they killing these other people?  <br /> <br />Then we see a kid my age on a bike, delivering a message to Robert Plant, who is watching his nude children run around in a river, with presumambly his wife next to him, I wouldn't know. We don't find out what the note says either. <br /> <br />Then John Paul Jones in drag, and John Bonoham on a farm, Jimmy Page with lazer eyes. This is what the band does before a show? I didn't really find it hillarious. <br /> <br />As for the music a third of it was quite good, but it just goes on and on and on. For example the Moby Dick thing, the \\"orgasmic\\" version of Dazed and Confused.  <br /> <br />Stairway to Heaven is the greatest song ever? Led Zeppelin is the best band? Stairway has the best solo ever? Bonzo the best drummer ever? Page the best guitarist? Plant the best singer? Gimmie a friken break. I say Hey Jude;Beatles;Free Bird;Keith Moon;Jimi Hendrix;Roger Daltrey. I believe that the best live band is Pink Floyd or the Who. The best musical band is maybe the WHo, and the best songwriting is definatley the Beatles.  <br /> <br />I'm not putting down Led Zeppelin. I have the BBC thing and it rocks. They have a number of good songs, but the group is very overated. I get tired of hearing \\"get the Led out\\", every friken day, not only on the radio, but from a classmate of mine. <br /> <br />Skip this, get their studio stuff, because they are terrible live. Leave these kinds of movies to Pink Floyd or the Who, who are veterans at making interesting Documentary/concerts films, and also real movies with stories. Check out \\"Live in Pompeii\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Live at the Isle of Wight\\", \\"The Kids are Alright\\", and the brilliant \\"Quadrophenia\\". <br /> <br />
6302158249|5.0|I have seen Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler live quite a few times, and of all the concert footage I have seen of Mark and the band, this is still the best. The concert was a sold out event at the Hammerstein Odeon in 1983, and presents a set of pre-\\"Brothers in Arms\\" classics that any Dire Straits fan should love. The concert also became the basis for the live two CD set of the same title, which is still probably my most played CD of all time.<br /><br />For those of you that have never seen Mark in concert, understand that he never plays a song exactly the same way twice, and that the live versions of the songs are generally a bit longer than their studio versions. That's fine with me, especially in the classics like \\"Tunnel of Love,\\" and especially the crowning achievement \\"Telegraph Road.\\" The strength of the band is critical to achieve the sound Knopfler demands, and \\"Telegraph Road\\" better illustrates the strong, yet subtle, interplay of all instruments in a Dire Straits live set than any other song (Terry Williams' drumming is particularly strong during this performance.)<br /><br />Seeing Dire Straits live was always my greatest musical thrill. This video is the next best thing to being there: it has great sound (much better than most concert films), great lighting, great photography, and is well edited. I give this video an unquestioned five stars.
B00065JTBA|4.0|Made in USA in 2004, Serial# B0003543-00, Playing Time 224:03 <br /> <br />I must admit from the very beginning that I'm not an un-conditional BON JOVI fan... There are songs I found extremely interesting (for example, \\"Raise Your Hands\\"), while others have a soporific effect (for example, \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\"). So I wouldn't say BON JOVI is the \\"best band in the world\\" (I actually find those types of remarks nauseating...) <br /> <br />I'm also not particularly fond of box sets, especially since fans (and/or myself) have the bulk of the material anyway! One must typically spend some hard-earned dollars for 2 or 3 \\"leftover\\" tracks of average interest/quality. <br /> <br />Lo and behold, this BON JOVI boxset is the HOLY GRAIL of boxsets; I take back everything I ever said about box sets: this one is THE exception to the rule!!! Putting aside the fact that the DVD is quite original and interesting (and about an hour long!), ALMOST every track here is previously unreleased. Unpolished demos, you say? NOT! Many (and I mean most) are of album production quality, and VERY enjoyable. <br /> <br />Though I was worried at first (I knew this was NOT a 'greatest hits' type boxset), I thought the material would be weak (my subconscious was hearing someone scraping the bottom of a barrel...) <br /> <br />To anyone looking for a Christmas present to a BON JOVI fan, this is IT. <br /> <br />This set will hopefully \\"raise the bar\\" to any other band thinking about releasing a boxset; this one is NOT intended to simply cash-in on previously released stuff: it's almost 4 hours of full compositions, like buying 4 new albums!!! <br /> <br />A MUST BUY.
B000002UAT|5.0|I can never understand why reviewers always feel that they should slag off people who disagree with them. Who cares? <br /> <br />As for the album, well, it's not bad. The production is bloody good, and not all George Martin's work. Musically, it is excellent, especially the strings on \\"within you, without you\\" and the key changes in \\"A day in the life\\". The album isn't perfect but it does come close. The lyrics are pretty good, especially \\"A day in the Life\\". If you don't know the beatles, start with something else, like the red and blue box collections or Abbey Road. This is the second-hardest album to love after the White Album. If you hate the beatles and everything they stand for, good for you. I hope you stopped reading a while ago, or you really would be strange. Give this a try, and if you don't like it, return it or give it as a present, I don't know.
B0000025RI|5.0|i have recently rediscovered this album and it is great. there is no denying jackson's talent.I am definately a fan of janet's, having been to a few of her live shows, but there is no denying that Michael is the most talented. It's too bad this tragic star will be remembered for his controversy as opposed to his talent. Was the childhood fame and endless work worth it? he will always live in infamy.
B000002J1Y|1.0|Giving one star for some vague remembrance of the remarkable original studio recordings of these tracks, which still raise a hair or two for a few seconds when heard on this album, especially \\"Close to the Edge\\", and why I thought this album sounded so good on vinyl 30 years ago, which it probably did.<br /><br />Leaves me to the conclusion of a horrible job of remastering, which makes this album barely inaudible at times. It sounds like it was remastered in a dank basement filled with old aluminum pots. Absolutely no depth, bottom or dimension to the music.<br /><br />Your equalizer won't help you here. I took it out of my player twice....just couldn't get through it. It actually hurt.<br /><br />Excuse me, I need to go back to studying the return policy for opened recorded music.
B00005AQGH|3.0|It's sad to think that Pac went out making beef instead of making peace with everyone. So if you think about it, its dissapointing that his last cd wasn't made up of songs dedicated to his momz and songs that were deep.  <br /> But that has nothihng to do with the quality of his last cd. Makaveli has a lot of good tracks, especially \\"against all odds\\" but it can't be compared to his other work. His best cds were \\"until the end of time\\" and \\"2pacalypse now\\", so basically only buy this cd if you are a big Tupac fan. This cd is good, but compared to other Pac cds, it's a joke.
B00006CJOY|5.0|As evidenced by these reviews, you either love this album 5 stars or hate it. What you get here is high energy and anthemic reggae and other assorted dance songs recorded all over the world. The whole idea of the album being repetetive is non-sense, reggae and ska music have a consistent sound and just because the people at the concerts are obviously enjoying themselves and screaming \\"hey, hey, hey...\\" does not mean this is a badly recorded album.  <br />Buy this album and add some color to your life. BOOM 5 stars!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Drew Barrymore was really great in this movie. I liked this movie because she actually got to know Prince Charming and \\"Cinderella\\" made her own dreams come true, without magic. I think it's a good message, especially for us girls growing up with this distorted fairy tale view that's never going to happen.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|That chain-letter sentiment is exactly how I feel every time I watch \\"Shawshank\\".  And having watched it a few times every year since 1997, I can safely attest to the fact that it only gets better with each viewing--so much so that I can't help but want everyone around me to revel in the experience as well.  Now with the release of this glorious 10th anniversary edition DVD, my dream has finally been realized.  \\"Shawshank\\" has recently been recognized as *the* most overlooked film of all time (eat that, \\"Forrest Gump\\"!), and that exact feeling of triumph resonates throughout the many satisfying special features on Disc 2.  So please, buy this DVD, sit back, and enjoy.  And don't forget to coerce everyone around you to watch it too!
B00005JMAH|3.0|After the first two movies came out, I was totally excited for number 3.  Not so good.  Doesnt even compair to Chris Columbus's work.  They dont even have school uniforms.  That isnt even close to like the book.  Things were cut out and not explained.  Get this, the first to movies were longer and the 3rd book has about 200 more pages.  Big disappointment for the harry potter fiends like myself.  No oliver wood?  Griffindor is suppost to win the cup!!!  Hello!!  That was like a huge thing in the 3rd book.  Its like leaving out the polly jucie potion in the Chamber of Secrets, ummm no, i dont think so.  Fred and George are hardly even in the movie!  Its not even that funny.  Come on Warner Brothers step its up.  Dont even think about ruining book 4 or Ill come after you in the night.
B00028HBKM|5.0|very very touching movie. <br />i cried throughout the whole thing. <br />very true to the bible. <br />recommended to all.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Call it The return of the living dread- Mummydonna. I guess you can have a career based on a classless reputation, zero singing and acting skills, and arms bigger than Arnold S' and the Incredible Hulk's combined. That is if you are desperate enough to want to stay in the spotlight no matter how dreadful a performer you are. Btw, I gave her an extra star just for that.
B000023X9W|5.0|I still regret this magnificent disc remains underestimated by the majority of the fans of Neil, exception made of course for the \\"specialists of Neil Young\\" or folk music lovers in general.<br /><br />As to me, of his studio albums, it is still the greatest together with \\"After the Gold Rush\\", right behind \\"HARVEST\\". From the beginning the artist sets the right tune with \\"Good to see you\\", followed by some numbers of the greatest quality like \\"Silver and Gold\\", the unforgettable \\"Daddy went walking\\", \\"Red Sun\\" and \\"Razor Love\\", to name the best as to me.<br /><br />In fact this is one of those rare albums where one finds no bad notes or mediocre songs. In \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" Neil has put some swing and changes immediately to the calm tune of the marvelous \\"The Great Divide\\", first rank top folk music, together with the last number \\"Without Rings\\".<br /><br />A GOLDEN DISC (as is his \\"Harvest\\" of course), that will remain so forever, on which one hears nothing else but the \\"real Neil Young of folk\\" as heard in circles of great lovers of this superb American artist. Credit also to the other musical styles he has been playing especially since the nineties: that is for certain the biggest talent of Neil. With great class he's been playing rock, even hard rock, not seldom with a \\"heavy\\" guitar and rather acoustic music. BUT HIS FOLK, THAT'S THE TOP, THE BEST OF NEIL YOUNG. This disc proves it without any doubt!
B000089RVR|5.0|This album, with Dido's sweet, angelic voice, her and brother Rollo's incredible writing, make a CD that you just cannot pass up. My favorite track is Don't Leave Home, a beautiful song that when first heard may sound like a love ballad, but is really a song about addiction, her voice is the best every on this track. If you haven't gotten this album yet, get it now!
B00005JMAH|3.0|Well, it wasnt to bad except for a few things. The new Dumbledor is to energetic and nothing LIKE the original. The director keeps using that damn fade circle between scenes. Not enough is explained. Dont waste your money. Oh, not to mention that it doesnt cope in the cool boxes like the first 2 movies. Other than that, the action is cool, and its not to bad.
B000002KB8|4.0|When this album was first released in 1970, its easy to imagine what kind of reaction people had to it. Some may have been amazed at hearing so new and original, others may have been frightened to hear something real and uncompromising. Black Sabbath's power lies in its flow; The album goes from track to track real well and only toward does it drag a bit. Without the amazing set of songs, this album would not have been as influential as it is now, even if it retained many of the heavy elements that it has. That being said, all four band members are in top form here. Iommi delivers amazing guitar work, matched only by the brilliant rhythm section of Butler and Ward. However, Osbourne's banshee like wails are what kept Sabbath alive. Had Sabbath debuted with Dio, its likely that this album would be as strong( no disrespect to Dio). Much more than a historical docmument, Black Sabbath is also a great record. With songs like NIB, Black Sabbath and Behind the Wall of Sleep, this would still be an amazing record even if it came out today. Pick up yourself a copy of Black Sabbath and immerse yourself today. You will happy that you did.

The odds aren't that good.\\"    In <em>The Art of the Start</em>, you'll read about positioning, pitching, bootstrapping, recruiting, raising capital, partnering, branding, rainmaking, and other things that go into launching a successful venture.     For instance, Kawasaki advises would-be entrepreneurs to devise a succinct mantra for internal consumption, to boil down the essence of the company's mission to a single phrase or idea. That's different from a tagline, which is for the public. Nike's mantra is \\"Authentic athletic performance.\\" Its tagline is \\"Just do it.\\"     He offers several large corporations and organizations a hypothetical mantra, free of charge. Coca-Cola: Refresh the world. Wendy's: Healthy fast food. March of Dimes: Save babies. U.S. Air Force: [...] in air and space.    Most newbies to the business world \\"fire up Word to write a business plan, launch PowerPoint to craft a pitch, or boot Excel to build a financial projection. Wrong, wrong, wrong!\\" he writes.    Instead, he advises, you should get going by getting going. Think big, strive for something grand. Don't work in a vacuum - find a few soulmates. Polarize people by creating something that catalyzes passion, pro and con.     Kawasaki isn't afraid to challenge conventional dogma, as when he advises, \\"Most experts wouldn't agree, but a business plan is of limited usefulness for a startup because entrepreneurs base so much of their plans on assumptions, 'visions,' and unknowns. ... Organizations are successful because of good implementation, not good business plans.\\"    He also points out that your pitch is more important than your business plan. Most entrepreneurs get it backward: \\"A good business plan is a detailed version of a pitch - as opposed to a pitch being a detailed version of a business plan. If you get the pitch right, you'll get the plan right.\\" He offers a 10-point list of the subjects that should be covered in any pitch for investors, and if you're looking for VC capital, this alone is worth the price of the book.    Another useful chapter is \\"The Art of Recruiting,\\" which should be in the bookcase of every HR department. The author - as he does throughout the book - taps into the experience of others, in the case, Amy Vernetti,  the headhunter for Kindred Partners, who outlines the art of reference checking. Among the questions she would ask of references:    - How would you rank him against others in similar positions?    - What contributions has he made to the organization?    - How do others in the organization view him?    - In what areas does he need improvement?    - Should I speak with anyone else about him?    I could go on, but you get the idea. Kawasaki has pulled together a lifetime of business lessons in this relatively short (226 pages), accessible and smart work.
B000062YB1|4.0|I never thought Slayer was a great band until I saw them at Ozzfest. Since I already had some of their albums, I decided to give them a spin to see if they retained the power of Slayer's live show. Seasons of the Abyss stands out as my favorite Slayer release because of the consistency of the material. I also enjoy the lyrics; Gone are the almost cartoony yet oddly apropriate demonic lyrics and in are the lyrics that deal with the harsh realities of life. Slayer has really hit a nail with these lyrics because they do not seem forced; You can hear the sincerity of Tom Araya's vocals. The instruments are in top from here, particularly, Dave Lombardo's amazing drumwork. He is definitely an underappreciated drummer. Rick Rubin has given the band some amazing production, since it accentuates all of Slayer's best parts. Seasons in the abyss is an amazing album. For fans of heavy metal, this one is worth listening to. Consider giving it a try; You be surprised to hear how good it is.
B000148KK2|5.0|The early Diana Krall albums were filled with terrific piano playing and very original vocal lines.  While the megahit \\"When I Look into Your Eyes\\" departed from the intimate jazz club-type settings of the early albums, it's orchestral arrangements still proved to be fresh and interesting. <br /> <br />I had been really disappointed with the follow-up album, \\"The Look of Love\\" -- it seemed way too sanitized and commercialized with absolutely none of the vocal or piano originality of the earlier works. <br /> <br />So, when I saw Diana's new album, \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\", I was a bit reluctant to buy it, fearing it would be even further down the sterile dull path she seemed to have gone the past few years.  But the copy featured a DVD/CD dual disc format, so I decided to buy it for that novelty alone. <br /> <br />Wow, what a delicious treat this album turned out to be!  There's more creativity and rich musicality to this work than her last 3 or 4 albums combined.  Some have commented that they've been disappointed with the pop-focused tunes, but take a few more listens and you discover lots of layers to these tunes-- deeply personal lyrics, great musicianship, and terrific Dolby DVD sound.   <br /> <br />Diana has proven herself not only an innovative vocalist and pianist, but now a talented songwriter as well.  Lets hope this is the start of some even better stuff to come. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|About 12 years ago (when I was only 8 years old), I started listening to nirvana.  I didn't own nevermind, or any other nirvana album.  I hadn't seen their music video on TV (didn't have cable), heard them on the radio, nor had I fallen into any trends or even known who kurt was or what he looked like.  I heard my older brother playing his cassette of nevermind, and after 2 weeks I had to beg him to record me a copy. <br /> <br />Well it almost got to a point when I was listening to this literally ALL THE TIME.  This cassette changed my life, it helped me get through bullying, the death of my best friend and almost having no friends at all. <br /> <br />I don't care if this CD doesn't have any good solos, overuses power chords, has crappy lyrics, has a dead singer or is a rip off of some other crappy band.  If this CD (and their other material) could affect me and so many other people so profoundly then that's gotta be worth something.  Please treat this band and this album with respect.

B0000026T4|3.0|Alice tried to go with the times, and produced this hair metal album, extremely glossy, slick and commercial. But come on, the choruses are infectious, the playing is highly competent and it resulted in fun music. Hey, a guy must pay his bills!
B000002UAO|5.0|I am a true Beatle maniac, owning every album, and having listened to each of them hundreds of times.<br />Rubber Soul, the 6th LP by the Fab Four, truly defines them as the greatest band of all time, and defines them as amazing musicians. <br />However, to truly love this album you must own Revolver, an amazing album that defines them as artists. <br />Together, they make my day.
B00004R99J|5.0|I think this might be one of the most amazing cinematic achievement like, ever.  People need to look past the off-kilter history behind the movie and look at the amazing story of love, hate, and action that is portrayed.  This movie, along with \\"Moonstruck\\", made me cry.  The movingly wonderful message of how you do not love with your eyes, but with the wisdom of your great-grandma, who happens to be a tree, and also with your heart.  I'm pretty sure that Disney was not trying to inform you of Pocahontas's life and death, but merely of a lesson we all need to realize: the road to being respected by your father requires staying steadfast to your lover and to be somewhat dramatic and sacrafice your life for your convictions.  Though I am over the age of thirteen, I sometimes pretend I am Pocahontas, and sing catchy tunes and stand on top of rocks and wave goodbye to my lover.   <br />This movie, plus the sequel, definitely qualify for a night of crying and laughing with Pokey and friends.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|When I first heard of \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", I admit that I thought it was going to be a definite tacky movie. (I guess the title was what kind of brought that thought up)So I rather forgotten about this in the excitement of looking forwards to the coming of other movies, like \\"Mr. Incredible\\", \\"National Treasure\\", etc. (Actually, I haven't seen any of those.) But when I went to see \\"Sky Captain\\", I could see how much I was wrong.<br /><br />The plot is very easily understood, making it a fun movie for both kids and adults. Joe Sullivan AKA Sky Captain (Jude Law) is a pilot who, with his ex-girlfriend (or is it?) Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), must save the world from the mad scientist Totenkopf who, obviously, wants to destroy it. There are other characters, like \\"Frankie\\" (Angelina Jolie) and Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), who helps them in their dangerous quest in finding Totenkopf and stopping him.<br /><br />What I liked especially about this movie is the witty and dry humor, especially in the banter between Joe and Polly. This got me laughing nearly all throughout the movie. Dex also has some funny lines as well. Recent movies barely has any 'witty' humor and if there are any humor at all, they are disgusting ones or the weak types that are in movies in which the teenage-girl-who-somehow-gets-what-she-wanted-because-she-disobeys-her-parents-usually-mother-in-every-single-way. Um...sorry, back to the subject. Anyway, \\"Sky Captain\\" was actually *funny* with really good, clean, and laughable humor.<br /><br />This is a movie for everyone, one of those few movies where every single member of the family can watch, be entertained, have fun, and not worry about anything foul, since, as I said, this is a clean movie. Can't wait till the DVD comes out, I'm definitely going to get it.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|The focus of Elf, is on a man named Buddy(Will Ferrell). When he was two years old and living in an orphenage, Santa visited the orphenage that he was staying at. He managed to sneak into Santa's bag of gifts and be taken back with Santa to the North Pole. When Santa and his elves realize that he brought back a human child, they decide to raise him as one of their own. Buddy is then taught to live like an elf and Buddy himself believes that he is one, until his 30th birthday. His surrogate father dubbed Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), tells Buddy the story, and that his real father is a man named Walter(James Cann) that lives in New York. Buddy sets off for New York to find his father and integrate himself into Walter's life that includes his wife Emily(Mary Steenburgen) and a ten year old son. The only problem is that since Buddy has been raised as an elf his whole life, he does not know how to act like a normal person. Buddy soon discovers that life in the big city is much different and much more difficult than life at the North Pole. <br /> <br />I was probably more skeptical than I have been in a long time going into watching Elf. I cannot stand Will Ferrell and the idea of a grown man acting like an elf sounded ridiculous to me. But due to the fact that Elf received such praise from moviegoers, and since I am a huge fan of James Cann, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give Elf a shot. Let's just say that I was wrong with my intial reaction to this film, because it turned out to be funny and enjoyable. Since this is the type of role that Will Ferrell was designed for, he was suprisingly tolerable in this film, and despite the fact that the plot looks ridiculous on paper, it works well for the film. Will Ferrell makes the character and his situation believeable. You really start to accept the fact that the guy is a 30 year old elf. Ferrell literally brings the character to life. James Cann who is usually known for his dramatic and tough guy roles, puts on a solidperformance in this movie. The reason why Cann is so funny in this film, is because he plays an uptight executive who is forced to accept a long lost son who is seemingly crazy. No matter what he does, he cannot get rid of Buddy and begins to feel obligated to take care of the son he never knew he had. <br /> <br />Overall, Elf is a film that is perfect for the whole family. It provides quality laughs and makes you feel good about Christmas in general. The extra features are great. You get three different featurettes, deleted scenes, and more. <br /> <br />4/5
B00001P4RI|4.0|A lot of people seem put off by this record. No surprise. You can certainly hear a lot more of the trademark Dead Can Dance sound in Lisa Gerrard's solo work than on &quot;The Eye of the Hunter.&quot; I've got to say, though, that after many listens, I tend to throw this CD in my player almost as often as DCD's &quot;Within the Realm of a Dying Sun&quot; or Lisa's &quot;The Mirror Pool.&quot; <br />No, it's not orchestral, tribal, or otherworldly, but that is its beauty. It is raw and emotional, and very, very human. If you are looking for inspiration, toss in &quot;The Serpent's Egg,&quot; but if you want company while you're going through a melancholy period, then this album is your best friend.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|there isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been said except for a few \\"important\\" things. First, this album, for nightwish standards is much heavier than previous work. The production is one of the best i have heard, crisp, powerful, and every instrument is clearly heard. What makes this album stand out from the others, other than the insane orchestra playing along, is they way they use the male vocals more strategically and balanced than on other albums. on century child i would hear the male vocals suddenly and try to figure out where the hell that came from, but on this album they are a nice addition. Tarja's operatic vocals even have a newer and improved sound to them. i could go on forever saying why this album rocks my socks off, but the bottom line is if you liked wishmaster and you were a little dissapointed with century child, DO NOT PASS THIS ALBUM OFF AS ANOTHER CENTURY CHILD, because it is a million times better.
B000006XDX|1.0|The first 2 songs on this album are so bad it made my jaw drop.  This is Camel's tenth studio album.  The original LP was about 38 minutes long.  There is one bonus track bringing the total time up to 41 minutes.  Sound quality is very clear and bright. <br /> <br />This is called the Single Factor because only Andy Lattimer from the original group remains.  There is a note that says drummer Andy Ward is not on the album because of a severe hand injury.  Rumor is that is not the real reason.   <br /> <br />This album has a mumber of prominent progressive rock guest stars:  Anthony Phillips (original guitarist of Genesis), Francis Monkman, Dave Mattacks and a couple of guys from the one of the Alan Parsons Project albums.  Except for some nice twelve string playing from Philips, a nice sax part from Mel Collins and bad, corporate rock vocals from the guys from Alan Parsons, the guest stars have very little impact on this album. <br /> <br />This album is Camel's attempt to get in on the progressive, corporate rock style of music of the time. This type of music was becoming very popular, and groups and record companies were looking to cash in.  It is similar to what Alan Parson and Asia were doing at the time.  If you like Asia or Parson's Eye In the Sky, you will probably like this CD. <br /> <br />Most of the vocal tracks on this album are pretty bad.  There are a couple, like Hero, that have some good parts.   <br /> <br />The only thing that keeps this album from being a complete waste is the two instrumental tracks.  Sasquatch is one of the most interesting things Camel has done.  Selva is OK, but sounds like a low rent copy of the Snow Goose.   <br /> <br />There is a 30 second track called Lullaby.  He didn't to write a specific lullaby.  Camel's previous album, Nude, was pretty much a snooze. <br /> <br />Pete Bardens had left Camel three albums ago, over artistic differences.  He went on to do some decent New Age music.  In the nineties, he formed a band called Mirage, with Ward and members of Caravan.  They went on tour performing Caravan and Camel songs.  He reformed Mirage with studio musicians, toured and released a concert album called Speed of Light Live or Mirage, Germany 1996.  He died in 2002. <br /> <br />Lattimer's Camel would put out one more studio CD in the eighties (plus live CD).  He would then move to California and form a new Camel.  Some of those albums, like Rajaz are great. <br />

B00005JKOI|5.0|John Hughes pretty much owns the '80s. His films to me are absolutely timeless. He had a real eye for teenagers and their high school experiences were like back in the Reagan era. \\"Pretty in Pink\\" definitely ranks as another classic from John Hughes. Once again we see Molly Ringwald as the protagonist Andie Walsh, the social outcast in her high school. Her best friends consists of Duckie (played by Jon Cryer) and Iona (Annie Potts). Andie lives with her father Jack Walsh (Harry Dean Stanton) who is an unemployed alcoholic. Like I said before, Andie is an outcast in her school. She dresses a lot differently from her classmates (as does Duckie). One day, Andie gets asked to the school dance by a rich classmate Blane (Andrew McCarthy) which does not sit well with Duckie who is secretly in love with Andie. Andie and Blane comes from two different worlds, Andie is from the wrong side of the tracks while Blane was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The class issue becomes an issue when Blane's best friend who is played by the brilliant James Spader makes an issue out of it, with the intentions of driving a wedge between Andie and Blane. The '80s music fit perfectly with the film. James Spader and Jon Cryer really stole the show here. I especially loved James Spader's smarminess as he tries to sabotage the budding relationship between Andie and Blane. James really has a lot of screen presence and his performance in \\"Pretty in Pink\\" was a sure sign to tell for his future Emmy winning performance as Alan Shore on \\"The Practice\\".

B00005JMJG|5.0|Thank goodness that we have Charlie Kaufman writing films. I just can't help but wonder how he comes up with stuff. He is by far the most creative and talented writer in the business, although he would say not to say, \\"in the business\\". This is a film of complete genius. The story, the acting, and the production are perfect. Jim Carrey is at his best. Kate Winslet hit a home run in my book. The whole cast Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah \\"Frodo\\" Wood is perfect. If you have not seen this film just buy it right now. You'll not disappointed. <br />This is the story of a guy trying to get over the break up of his relationship. When he hears that his girlfriend has had him erased from her memory he does the same thing. The film follows Joel (Carrey) through his memory as he tries and hold on to the memories of his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet) when he decides he still loves her. The visual effects are incredible as walls disappear, faces are erased, memories are lost. This is love story about two people who try and forget each other only to find they can't live with out each other.
B00005Q45W|5.0|After all these years, Cohen keeps up the good work. \\"A thousands kissing deep\\" and \\"In my secret life\\" manage to get to the level of his classics like 'Suzanne' and \\"So long Marianne\\".
B00008H2LB|5.0|I am an older fan, being over 40.  I have a fairly ecclectic taste in music and generally I can find something I like in almost any genre.  I am not big on old style country music or rap music, but other than that I have favorites in just about every music style.   <br /> <br />To me a good album is one where you don't feel like you have to skip songs because you just can't stand them.  There are very few albums that are chock full of good songs.  Most have one to three songs that I like and the rest of the album ranges from bad to aweful.   <br /> <br />Having said all that I have to say that this album is fantastic!  There is only one song that is merely good, and the rest are very well done.  You can tell that more than one of the band members like to engineer as much as play.  I find it interesting that the soul of the band are the two engineers (Shinoda and Hahn) that met each other in art school.  I think that says alot about what this band is about.  They love what they are doing and it comes through in their music.  <br /> <br />Despite the heaviness of the guitar-work in most of the songs, it is one of the cleanest and most precise sounding albums I have ever heard.  The lyrics are probably meaningful to the younger crowd, but they are well thought out.  The songs are different enough from each other to stay fresh and they are all very melodic and energy filled.  Many of the songs are filled with in your face power and several are quieter and more thought provoking.  The players in the band are maturing with life experience and it is showing in the feel of the songs. <br /> <br />It is a great sophmore effort and I can't wait to see what comes out of the next studio collaboration.
B00005JNEI|1.0|When I first saw this flick, I was incensed at the behavior of the president reelect and very saddened by the mother of her fallen son in Iraq but what incensed me even more was the missing footage of the planes crashing into the towers.  HOW ON EARTH CAN I SAY SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE?  <br /> <br />Michael Moore's movie, while incontestable on the subject of Iraq and WMD's, the ridiculousness of the supreme court actions regarding the recount, and no senator signing any African-American protest to the vote, has no business borrowing from Ray Bradbury or 9/11 for titular material. Sure our military is in Iraq allegedly because of that day, but he should have titled it BUSH/10W-40 instead. Eyewitness accounts of the \\"attacking\\" planes having no windows and not even being American airlines at all have less credibility than Moore's manipulation of the 2000 election coverage? Not a single clip of the collapsing WTC tops in a free fall because the bottoms of the towers disintegrated underneath? Why wasn't the preposterous fact that the Bush administration and most media networks propagated such utter nonsense by  telling us that  the collapse of the hurricane force resistant  WTC was because the burning jet fuel (basically the kerosene in our heaters) melted steel and the tops came crashing through the rest of the towers? All of this in complete defiance of the of the laws of nature? <br /> <br />Yes, this movie is patriotic in that it reeks with dissent which I believe is VERY American. But to absolutely positively ignore the science of planes hitting buildings and having those buildings selectively preserve or destroy terrorist DNA and two of the buildings undergo total pulverization because their tops on September 11, 2001 were all of a sudden too heavy to support were some things that really needed attention. Sorry Mr. Moore, only one star for Iraq.  You could of had 'em all but you forgot about your high school science education and you forgot that quite a few of us did not.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's been ten years since I purchased CD that got me this excited.  From beginning to end this album is a sonic masterpiece and a balm for the soul.  Buy this record.  Thank you Green Day.
B00009P1O2|4.0|This show from the 1986 Magic tour is worth owning, particularily because the crowd intensity will give you goosebumps. The folks in the nosebleed seats are just as jacked up as the fanatics in the front, and it's quite an amazing sight. The performance by Queen is solid, and the opening few numbers will have diehards nodding their heads in approval (including an always welcome \\"In The Lap Of The Gods--Revisted\\").     However, of the three available live Queen DVDs in the US, Live at Wembley Stadium is probably the one I watch least. Don't get me wrong, overall the show IS essential viewing, but much of it feels too \\"glossy\\" compared to earlier tours. The extra synth work (coming from offstage) takes the edge off many songs, and the band's sense of urgency is not on the level of the On Fire At The Bowl or We Will Rock You DVDs IMO...at times, it sounds less like \\"Queen: Rock Band\\" and more like \\"Queen: Pop Band\\". Having said that, \\"Queen: Pop Band\\" is still more acceptable than 90% of what else is out there.     But the bottom line is, Live At Wembley Stadium is an important piece of Queen history, and it's definitely worth recommending...and not just for the concert either, 'cuz the bonus features are also worth viewing...
0679429247|2.0|I have amassed a rich collection of audio books and this is by far the worst. I bought it several years ago, started listening to it, and stopped halfway through. I just couldn't get into it. Recently, I tried to listen to it again, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around. It was just as bad. Whereas, with most audio books, the narration adds to the content of the book, in this one, it kills it. If you want to read this book, stick to the paperback version.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This is the most anti-semitic movie I have ever seen.  I will never watch another Mel Gibson movie again!  The scariest part is that, with his status as a celebrity, Gibson has the ability to turn the nation into so many anti-semites.  He is setting a negative example for Americans and for the international community as well.  Just think - [...] only had the ability and resources to influence the opinions of the citizens of one country ... and he was responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews.  Gibson's influence is far wider.

I would give this album a rating of 5 except that I'm disappointed with the sound quality of the re-mastered CD.

B00006G8K0|4.0|\\"Horror of Dracula\\" was the first color film based on Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" novel, and the first in which vampires have incisor-like fangs. \\"Horror of Dracula\\" retains the gist of Bram Stoker's story, but the details have been altered considerably and characters switched around. Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) is newly employed by Count Dracula (Christopher Lee) to index the library at his castle. Harker's trip does not go as he planned, and 10 days later Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), an imminent scientist and close friend, arrives at Castle Dracula in search of Jonathan, only to find that it is too late to change his fate. Upon returning home, Van Helsing finds that Dracula has found a new victim in Harker's fianc&eacute;e, Lucy Holmwood (Carol Marsh). He enlists the help of Lucy's brother, Arthur Holmwood (Michael Gough) to rid the world of Dracula's blood-sucking menace forever.<br /><br />Christopher Lee, who would go on to play Dracula in 7 films, makes a suave, tidy Count. He is not as old-fashioned in his tastes or manner as the Dracula of Stoker's novel, but he is suitably aristocratic. \\"Horror of Dracula\\", like the films before it, make use of Dracula's inability to walk around during daylight hours, a concept not found in the novel, but which debuted in F.W. Murnau's 1922 adaptation \\"Nosferatu\\". Every successive adaptation of \\"Dracula\\" seems to exploit this device more than the last. \\"Horror of Dracula\\" takes place in what is apparently Germany of the late-19th century. Judging by the cities mentioned in the film, the story unfolds in 3 different nations that are only hours apart by carriage. As this is not possible, I take the cities to be fictitious and the location to be Germany. \\"Horror of Dracula\\" was essential in the evolution of Count Dracula's image. It borrows and builds on Murnau's fatal sunlight and Bela Lugosi's cape, but Dracula gets new teeth -and the blood is now really red. A must for \\"Dracula\\" fans.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a short list of cast and crew, an essay about Hammer Studios' Dracula films 1958-1974 entitled \\"Dracula Lives Again!\\", and a theatrical trailer.

B00005JN0T|5.0|A film is an entirely different medium of art that a book.  For a book to be adapted into a film, there are necessary changes that must be made to make the film effective.  Yes, the story is almost entirely changed from Azimov's book, but what matters is how good the film is on its own.  Look at the Lord of the Rings films.  They really aren't especially faithful portrayals of Tolkien's masterpieces, yet as films they are arguably the greatest achievement in movie history.  I, Robot, is an undeniably good film.  It creates a believable near-future world, it brings up the essential moral questions that are brought up in the books, the acting is very competent, the story is engaging (especially compared to other sci-fi films), and it is absolutely stunning from a visual standpoint.  There is no reason to be hissy about the film's unfaithfulness to Azimov.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I'm a GNR fan so I would support and buy almost anything they put out....<BR>I was lucky enuff that my sis mailed me this cd as a gift (thanx!) but I probably only listened to it 3 times.  Like I said, I own all their albums.  Greatest Hits are really for ppl who don't own any of the band's material, so it's a great &quot;introductory&quot; lesson (hey, if you're young like me and don't know much about the Stones, get &quot;hot rocks&quot; and you'll end up fallin in love and buying thier whole library!)  Same goes for GNR...you young ones (younger than me, or those that missed out when they were at the height of their carrer)...go out an buy this (it's pretty cheap if you get it now in the stores too).  Then if you like it (and you will!!) buy appetite and the Illusion records for sure.  Lies is awsome (has &quot;you're crazy--one of my favourites) and Spaghetti is good for you snot nosed punks out there :)  <br />Now for the actual album:<BR>-did anyone notice that &quot;aint it fun&quot; is censored??  WHY??<BR>-Where on earth is Estranged---I know for a fact a lot of guns fans LOVE this song (myself incl')--so beautiful<BR>-should've came with like a dvd or something special--for kicks<BR>-geffen should've titled it &quot;singles&quot; or something and then incl' all thier singles<br />so overall, it's what you expect from a greatest hits cd--a good intro lesson---but it does take away from thier work....<BR>my advice to you, is if you're not familiar with GNfn'R...get Appetite for destruction--it's a greatest hits right there (every freakin song is genius---trust me!!!!)<BR>And if you are familiar with GNR by ALL thier albums and DVDs---you won' regret it!!!!
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess is not only a great storyteller, but a literary god. He invents a language and manages to translate it brilliantly without destroying the story. The book is perfect. It describes a horrifying moral society when the children take over at night. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. Read the book it is much better and it includes chapter 21, the most important chapter. The book may scare you and the first few chapters may make you want to stop reading but the book is amazing. Highly recommended
0743243307|4.0|For the first 200 pages, Brick Lane is absolutely fascinating and the story of Nazneen, her childhood in Bangladesh and how he she is married off to London really grabs. But from then on, the story starts to drag a bit (like some other reviewers, I couldn't get into the 40 pages of Hasina's letters, written in broken English). <br />Still, all in all I think the hype for this book is deserved: The alienation of Bangladeshis in London is very well described, the characters in the book are multilayered and believable (for example, Chanu, Nazneen's husband, is a gem and Mrs Islam adds some color, too) and there is enough substance, inelligence and feeling to fill half a dozen of lesser books. With a bit of pruning, Brick Lane could have been a perfect 350 page novel.
B000002GVZ|3.0|In the early 70s, a blend of jazz/folk/rock emerged on the East Coast.  Although having folk elements, it was not part of the 60s folk revival and was distinct from both the folk/rock movement in Britain and the 'Beatles meets folk' West Coast sound.  It was jazzier and more metropolitan in style.  Its most famous exponents are Carly Simon and Carole King.<br /><br />This album presents a good selection of Simon's early 70s work.  A more comprehensive collection, spanning her entire career, can be found on \\"Anthology\\".<br /><br />If you like Carole King you will probably like Carly Simon, and vice versa.  (And you can add the 70s work of Neil Sedaka, King's contemporary and friend, to that list).  King appears on one track here, 'Attitude Dancing', albeit that is the weakest track on the album.  Simon's then husband, James Taylor shares vocals with her on \\"Mockingbird\\".  Many reviewers seem to have found \\"Mockingbird\\" too quirky or 'goofy', but I say it's a masterpiece, and the album's best track by far. Although not penned by her, it is redolent of \\"Itsy-Bitsy Spider\\", that she sings over the credits in the movie \\"Heartburn\\".  If you have not heard it, you should.  Taylor also plays guitar on several other tracks.<br /><br />Carly Simon has a great voice and is a considerable musical talent.  Her lyrics lack the poetic depth of James Taylor, Joni Mitchell or Bob Dylan, and she cannot summon up the soulfulness of Joni Mitchell or Judy Collins, but the total package - singer, songwriter and musician - remains a great and unique pleasure.
6303443214|5.0|I saw it and loved it, later I read the book and totally loved it. At that point I stopped loving the movie, the book is great, the movie isn't. It's kind of making fun of the book. I read all the books Anne Rice wrote, not only the Vampire Chronicles. She is the greatest. The movie doesn't reflect that but Antonio Banderas as Armand is very, very sexy and it's exactly as I would see Armand. In the books Armand is a young boy but very sexy and full of charisma, I believe that Banders with that long dark hair is the best image of Armand. I love Armand, he's my perfect man, but as a boy, as an image it's not good. He's strong and mature, intelligent and sooooo sexy, he can't be viewed as a boy, he's a man trapped in a body of a teenager, now to put that on the screen would have been a complete turn-off. So I liked Banderas. Kirsten Dunst was great too.  <br />About the subject, well it's a DRAMA, NOT HORROR, try to ignore the blood-sucking and you'll see it. But better yet, read the book. I'm sure that if you read one, you'll end up reading the chronicles. I like best \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", read after \\"Interview with the vampire\\" is best. You'll get a better idea of Armand. I didn't like \\"The Vampire Armand\\", I find it dull.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is my role model. I love to sing as well as dance, and there's no one that inspires me more than the lovely Beyonce. Her voice is so amazing, and her music touches my heart. The album dangerously In Love definitely gets a \\"two thumbs up\\" from me. I would say that this album is food for the soul. <br /> <br />I love an album that sets the mood between two people. There are a lot of people in love, so it's always good to have love songs on an album. The song Speechless and Dangerously in Love Part 2 are two great songs to listen to when you're either thinking about your mate, or even when you're with them. In the song speechless it takes your breath away. I love this song because the rhythm is nice and slow and it works well with the choice of words. Dangerously in Love part 2 is also great. It's describing how much she loves her mate and how he sets her free. How she can't live life without him. This song is very  compassionate. <br /> <br />Me, Myself and I, was one of my favorite songs on the album. I love this song because it's saying that you're all that you have. I truly live by this. I have friends and a boyfriend, but I know that no one has my back like I do. I'm my own best friend just as Beyonce stated in the song. <br /> <br />Daddy was another song that captured my attention. It's sad to say that I can't really relate to this track, but I still love it. Beyonce is saying that she wants her unborn son to be just like her daddy. Every time I listen to this song I get sad because I wish that I could say the same thing about my father. She's saying how father was understandable when she made mistakes etc. Overall the song is good. I sometimes change the words and add in Mommy for Daddy. <br /> <br />The album Dangerously in Love is great. It has all types of variations. Her voice is astonishing and the lyrics couldn't be better. I would recommend for any one to purchase this album. Trust me it's well worth it.   <br /> <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|Yes, reading some comments made by other people I definitely agree on something: this album is not Mutter. But that doesn't mean it's bad, but it's amazingly good and trust me, one of the best albums out there.  If you're buying this album because you liked \\"Links 2 3 4\\" and \\"Du Hast\\" and never listened to other stuff, then don't do it. To my opinion (Rammstein fan since Sensucht, seen them twice and got the album 2 days before it's release date in Europe) this album may not surpass what Mutter left us, but it's still one great album that at least equals Mutter's quality and that can really represent what Rammstein is.   The most commercial song you'll get is Amerika, which was actually intended to be the most commercial track in the whole album, but still one that is great and will not be boring to listen to, as \\"Du Hast\\" or \\"Links 2 3 4\\" would be. Best tracks? well I must say that I automatically fell in love with \\"Reise, Reise\\", \\"Mein Teil\\" and \\"Ohne Dich\\". Other tracks may need more than one listen, specially if you're listening to it for the first time and comparing it with Mutter (I made that mistake).  It's not Mutter, but it's still Rammstein, and my only recommendation is not to make any comparison... each one is unique but still retains that Rammstein sound that I personally like.   And about one really ignorant individual who said that \\"Rammstein bit the hand that feeds them\\" I must answer to that single person, that you're a complete #$%&@, Rammstein doesn't need the U.S.A. to be succesful. They actually have more than enough with Europe and (yes believe it or not) Mexico to be succesful. I can't stand people saying that they can't stand critisism against their countries errors.   So one more comment before, if you're idiotized with the \\"God bless America\\" and \\"Our troops fighting for freedom in Iraq\\" stuff, save money and time and don't listen to it. You're way too brainwashed to objectively make an opinion.
B00008L3U1|2.0|... if Coppola and Williams had at least made a single mention of progeria.  What's progeria, you say?  Well, it's this very real, rare disease that causes children to age 10 years for every year they live.  Of course, they don't look like an average adult, but then Robin Williams wouldn't have been able to run around acting like a kid for a couple of hours.  However, if the crew had used the comedy aspects to hook viewers, and then give them information about progeria at the end, I would have been okay with it.  But since they didn't, I will: [...] <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|I grew up listening to the Beatles and then in the 80's U2 was like the Beatles of the next generation. I loved Boy, War, October, Unforgettable Fire, Under a Blood Red Sky, Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, and Actung baby...Then comes the era of weakness.  Pop had one or two good song, as did each subsequent album. The only good track is the most commercial one (Vertigo) most of the other tracks sound like throw aways, second stringers, and not something that should be on a U2 album.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong they are still a great band, but its starting to feel like they are running out of things to write and sing about.  Maybe Bono needs to worry less about his hair and get really pissed about something like he used to and write some good music with Edge. <br /> <br />Buy the Single (Vertigo) skip the album.
0345409671|4.0|Great book if you start it from about the middle. The beggining is not so captivating. Memnoch. Is he really the devil? I mean the devil? I like his story, I believe it's really good, well built. Makes people question things. If you're not fanatic about relligion and you keep an open mind, you'll enjoy this book. Please be patient at the start, it takes a while but it gets really good. The end isn't the best, I can't rate this 5 stars, sorry. I don't claim I fully understand everything in this book, but, it's not so bad and if you'll read the next one \\"Vampire Armand\\"...than you'll find out two things: first, and very important, Armand didn't suceed in killing himself, second, Armand looses his charm in that book, his only excuse is Beethoven...I mean the sonata \\"Appassionata\\":) That's one 1 star book:(, this one is much better.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Yes this movie is deffinately not a dissapointment to volume 1, it is equally as great, the movie is a bit different but not in a bad way, I mean it would suck if they made a repitition of the first one and just kill all the bad guys with no extra story. In this installment qt dwells more into the story background, reveals who bill is, shows the training Beautrix went through before becoming the words deadliest women, oh yeah it reveals her name (BEAUTRIX).<br /><br />Different from volume 1, volume two brings in some family loves after beautrix finds her daughter, Beautrix is a much more likable character in vol 2, the movie makes you accually feal sorrow for her shows what she really has undernief the whole killing thing. I have to be honest volume two has no where near as much action as vol 1 so it is important that you watch the first installment first just to get a feal for the story, the movie still entertains to the full extent.<br /><br />Volume 2 has all the great camera shots of Uma's battle face and still uses the japanamation on some flashback scenes so dont worry the movie deffinately hasn't lost itself. The movie is fit with a great soundtrack and some great fighting scenes, after a whole lot of crap happening to her Beautrix finally makes it to her key objective and i'll leave it to you to find out what happens there.<br /><br />If you watched volume 1, there is no way you can miss volume two don't worry what anyone else says, the movie is brilliant and will leave you with a good feeling.
B0002Y4T92|1.0|Very sad with minimal McLaughlin, no Jeff Beck for heavens sake.  BBKing either. Need I say more.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is so freaking funny, I think it was a surprise hit in the theathers not many of them were showing it. Surprisingly it has a story line, it develops characters, you don't hate Shaun or his \\" couch potato\\" buddy of his, you'll even learn to love Phillips! This movie has it all gore, romance, humor, very dark humor, and good sci fi effects. I can't wait till it comes out and I'll be a proud owner come the 21st!!..Thank God for british humor!
B00025ETIW|5.0|These guys toured with The Used and they sound similar to The Used and they rock live.  I suggest you buy the CD it is freakin amazing
B00005JMEW|5.0|When i first heard of this movie I thought it was just gonna be another repeditive action movie and i was forced into watching by some friend. I WAS A COMPLETE IDIOT THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME, this movie is Quentin Tarrentino at his absolute best and is a must see for anyone, trust me this movie is as original as ever.<br /><br />Uma Thurman plays the words most deadly woman (name unknown) and is seeking revenge after her friends were massacred and she was shot in the head by a so called Bill, meraculously she survives the bullet and is put in a coma, she escapes the hospital and starts seeking revenge by writing up a list of who to lay her sword.<br /><br />The film is fit with some wild camera angles and a mix of black & white and colour scenes to add extra tone and cover up the extremely gory scenes. The movie is based around the manga style storyline also including some scenes/flashbacks in japanese animation this is one of the things that makes this movie special.<br /><br />You will be guaranteed suspense,action and laughter you can trust me you should love it!!
B000669GAI|5.0|This is amazing! My favourite band in the world have released a cd with all their best stuff on and some extra songs not off their studio albums. I love this CD. I have loved Pearl Jam since the first time i heard them a few years ago. I bought TEN and then have bought all their CDs and loads of their live CDs. This is a good collection of songs. There are the really raw, aggressive songs like SPIN THE BLACK CIRCLE, GO and NOT FOR YOU and then there are the heart warming, inspiring songs like NOTHING MAN, BLACK and GIVEN TO FLY that are a bit softer but still powerful. Then there are old favourites like ALIVE, REARVIEWMIRROR, DAUGHTER and YELLOW LEDBETTER. Overall this is a fantastic album that Pearl Jam fans will love and novices can start with.
B000687M48|5.0|Ok, this of course, like any other Evanescence cd, it the best.  It shows just how awesome Amy Lee really is!  She has a beautiful voice, she is talented, and she is funny, oh yeh and she is beautiful.  The guys in the band know how to play some awesome music also.  For the person who said Amy needs to lose about 50 lbs... you are crazy.  Amy is beautiful, she is healthy, and she doesn't need to be stick thin to be that way.  At least she doesn't prance around trying to be something she isn't.  This is the greatest just like Evanescence
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This CD is what you call an acquired taste.  You have to listen to it several time before you start to say hey these British guys are pretty good.  Its an all around good CD
B00005JNJT|5.0|I've followed this film's production for a good while now.  This movie will reboot the Batman franchise.  The story will be a treat for Batfans non-Batfans alike.    Judging from his interviews, Christian Bale is taking this role very seriously, even dedicated it to his father who passed away the end of last.  This man will become the new embodiment of Batman/Bruce Wayne.    June 17th everyone...it Begins!!!
B000002BYD|5.0|This CD is brilliant. Right from the start of the raw, punky BRAIN OF J to the quirky ALL THOSE YESTERDAYS this CD never has a dull moment. GIVEN TO FLY has inspiring lyrics and LOW LIGHT is beautiful with great harmonies and chilled out meody. It seems to lack some of the angst that Vs and Vitalogy had but it is definately a great Pearl Jam album that is worth having.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />self-awareness and doubt plagued the band. That's the reason why many fans feel U2 is dead. U2 was U2 because they used to discover and reinvent themselves with every new album. Those days are dead and gone forever. Now U2 seem only too happy here to re-embrace their original sonic trademarks in service of more daring, pop-melodic hooks than they've collected in one place in decades. The Rock's most self-assured band is just resting on their laurels they won with albums like Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby or Pop. With just that fake promise to go back to their \\"classic\\" 80's sound many fans swallow this weak and shameful \\"effort\\" once again. <br /> <br />There's a serious lack of intensity in this failure \\"bomb\\". Moreover, This album lacks anything truly new.  <br />Producers assembled simply construct a \\"new\\" U2 album in miniature, mixing in the Edge's processed-guitar trademark whenever you fear they're straying into unforgivable un-U2ness. That's just not enough. The overall concept used in this album seems to be \\"We need money now !!!, let's re-work ATYCLB outtakes, we need some singles, etc\\" <br /> <br />Everything is trademark here: anthemic sound, best album promises, songs syle, a rock first single, U2 brand name, Bono, producers, hype, \\"biggest band in the world\\" publicity, etc. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a one-paced affair, enamoured with drawn-out ambient intros, crystalline guitars layered with reverb, four-note rumbles for basslines, choruses that go on forever and occasional, half-hearted stabs at \\"groove\\". Meaning that it sounds EXACTLY as easy fans would expect U2 to sound: \\"Classic\\".  <br /> <br />They aren't classic U2 indeed. In five years, they'll be buried as deeply in our collective consciousness as other nice, but ultimately superfluous U2 numbers like last album's \\"It's a Beautiful Day.\\" \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" it sure isn't. <br /> <br />It's impossible to shake the feeling that U2's playing it safe once again on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. No surprises here.  <br /> <br />U2 just presented 11 ATYCLB songs from the hype-machine that surrounds this album. iPod ? Apple Tunes ?, rather it's time for U2 to risk it all and push forward. <br /> <br />So this album probably will go on to make U2 and their corporate backers way richer even than they already were. Good for them, I guess. As far as the actual album's concerned, it's far from being a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />and don't forget something: U2 won't apologize with fans for this new All That You Can't Leave Behind after their longest break ever, because they're \\"the biggest band in the world\\". No matter about Bono, who's kissing his past indeed ... <br />
0380789019|5.0|Everybody traveling in London by Tube, is familiar with the loudspeaker's warning \\"Mind the Gap\\", that is the space between platform and train carriage.  Reading Gaiman, \\"gaps\\" take on a much more complex meaning... People can fall through the gaps/cracks, literally, not only down onto the rails but much deeper, ending up in \\"London Below\\".  Richard Mayhew, a young man with nothing much happening in his life, is an unlikely Samaritan.  Still, when confronted with a choice he follows his charitable instinct and assists a wounded rag girl he finds lying in the street. To save her from her apparent killers he goes on a quest and from this moment his life turns into a rollercoaster of discovery and danger.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is a brilliant yarn of life in the underbelly of the city, with shady human characters, speaking rats and special \\"guides\\". There is more than one reality for sure. In London Above, Richard and the rag girl, named appropriately \\"Door\\", can be seen but not recalled beyond the moment.  The real-life maze of London underground tunnels, hidden passageways and dead ends provide the existent, yet twisted, backdrop to the story.  Time and distances have no meaning. The names of tube stations acquire new relevance: the Earl resides at Earl's Court, the black Friar monks are in Blackfriars and Islington is an Angel.  Following Door and her unusual companions, Richard discovers the limits of his endurance.  He has to question his existence and reality. While his desire to get back to his normal life keeps him going, his chances to shake loose from the shadowy underworld increasingly appear to diminish...<br /><br />The novel, which expands on Gaiman's successful tv production, is a great read, whether you know London or not (yet).  His style is fluid and engaging, his characters are very much alive and moving the various layers of intrigue along at a good pace.  [Friederike Knabe]
B00005RHGK|4.0|I hear an amazing amount of chatter nowadays about the generally poor quality of recent horror film releases. Fans of the genre point to films plagued with cliches, the endless stream of remakes, and just about anything else they find objectionable as evidence that the era of horror is over. I'm not absolving myself here; I do a fair amount of complaining myself from time to time. It's easy to do when you watch something like \\"Shatter Dead\\" or \\"Slash.\\" If I truly thought these two films represented the future of horror, I would volunteer to shovel the first bit of dirt on the grave myself. Then again, there are people who genuinely like these two movies and wish to see more films like them. Personally, I am getting to the point where I welcome the good with the bad. For one thing, I secretly enjoy watching terrible films. There is something enormously entertaining about trashing a real piece of schlock. Too, I would rather see ANY horror film arriving on the scene than none at all. Think about it: if people quit renting horror, the next wave of fans turned talented directors and producers might never fulfill their destinies. All of this is a rather convoluted way to say the following: \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a pretty good modern horror movie. It's definitely not another \\"Shatter Dead\\" or \\"Slash.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jeepers Creepers\\" tells the horrific tale of Trish Jenner (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long). The problems begin when Darry drives his sister home from college. This isn't your normal jaunt across town or through a couple of neighborhoods, but a cross-country excursion that takes several days. Worse, the two have to navigate their way through the flat plains of the Midwest, which, as I can assure you from personal experience, is a daunting expedition. In the true tradition of Hollywood, they can't pick anything up on their radio except some loudmouth preacher bible thumping about the apocalypse. Since the trip takes place during the summer, the heat makes them antsy. The opening sequences of the movie show the two quibbling with each other about personal problems and their parents. Trish also takes Darry to task for straying far from the security of the interstate system in order to take the \\"scenic\\" route. Needless to say, she's more right than she knows. Things take an ominous turn when a souped up black truck/van hybrid roars up behind them. With horn blazing away, this vehicle repeatedly swerves, bumps into Darry's car, and generally acts like most drivers in my hometown. He runs the two kids off the road but doesn't bother stopping.<br /><br />Later, when the two happen to cruise by an abandoned church just in time to see the driver of the aforementioned black vehicle dumping what looks like a body wrapped in a bloody sheet down a drainpipe, the trip takes on ominous dimensions. He--at least we think it's a he although it's hard to tell with all those black clothes and a coat on--jumps into his car and comes after them again. Trish and Darry manage to avoid another confrontation but foolishly decide to head over to the church to see what went into the pipe. Down into the ground goes Darry, only to discover an enormous cavern decorated with human wallpaper. It appears that the guy dumping corpses into this pipe has been doing it for eons considering the number of bodies hanging all over the place. Darry manages to get out, reunite with Trish, and hightail it down the road to the nearest diner to make the obligatory call to the cops. But yet another weird incident occurs, this time an out of the blue phone call to the kids on the payphone from a woman claiming to be a psychic. She knows all about what they saw and warns them of extreme danger. What we eventually learn about this guy is that he's no guy at all, but some flying demon awakened from his years long sleep. He's out collecting humans and now he has his sights set on Trish and Darry. Throw in the Cat Lady (Eileen Brennan), a couple of cannon fodder cops, good gore, and you have all the makings for a fun filled horror romp.<br /><br />The first part of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" works better than the second half. The rather calm world of the Jenner kids suddenly shattered by a weirdo in a spooky vehicle out in the middle of nowhere is a terrifying proposition that the film pulls off well. Just as eerie is the glimpse of this black clad figure dumping the corpse in the drainpipe. Although I can't find it anywhere on the web, I swear that the writer got the idea for this scene from an episode of \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" where the same situation happened to several travelers somewhere in the United States (minus the flying demon, of course). Once the psychic Jezelle (Patricia Belchar) physically enters the picture, the movie loses some of its steam. By this time Trish and Darry are in a police station facing the prospect of the Creeper running rampant in the building. The resulting scenes of carnage reminded me too much of a similar scene in \\"Darkness Falls\\" even though \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" did it first. In short, I think the movie is scarier when we don't know what Trish and Darry are up against.<br /><br />Still, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is definitely worth watching. For once MGM actually loaded up for bear with the extras. We get a commentary track with director Victor Salva, plenty of deleted scenes, stills, cast and crew filmographies, and a making of featurette. Followed by an intriguing sequel that is in and of itself entertaining although it doesn't quite capture the magic of the first installment, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is a prime example of how horror movies can still attain a measure of originality and scares.nnon fodder cops, good gore, and you have all the makings for a fun filled horror romp. <br /> <br />The first part of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" works better than the second half.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|At first glance, I heard Ian, from Echo.  Then the production reminds me of Guided by Voices type work.  Then later in the recordings, the singer, almost hints at a Roger Waters tone.  And then the recording Ends with a Bjork type song.  The recording is better than any reference, previously expressed herein.  Just get it.  It's awesome.  Anyone who digs the do it yourself Indie sound, then you will love this one, for decades to come.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I would just like to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time!!!  Ryan Phillpe is so sexy, and Sarah Michelle Geller is great as Kathryn, who's a life-ruining b*tch.  Reese Witherspoon, who is a really good actress, plays Annette, the good girl, and she does a GREAT job at it.  My friends and I all love this movie and watch it a lot.  Of course, my sister had to bring it to school last year and she lost it, so I'm asking for a new one for Christmas.  Anyway, it's an awesome movie.  Please please PLEASE buy it or at least rent it.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I'm not even a Shania fan, but I figured that because she's such a superstar now I ought to own at least one of her albums.  Luckily, this greatest hits came out just in time.  So, if you have to own one, this is the one to get, because it does have most of her big hits and it does span her entire recording career thus far.  It's an interesting listen.
0792839730|4.0|\\"A Bridge Too Far\\" reminds me of an Irwin Allen film. Allen, if you're not familiar with his work, made a bunch of epic disaster films in the 1970s packed to the rafters with big name stars. His \\"The Swarm\\" is a schlock classic that every lover of bad cinema should add to their must see list. In the case of \\"A Bridge Too Far,\\" we're still seeing an all star cast disaster film, but this disaster took place during World War II when the Allies decided to stage a daring paratroop drop behind enemy lines. The idea was to knock Germany out of the war quickly by seizing several key bridges in Holland in quick succession and then send Allied forces directly into the Ruhr Valley, the heart of Germany's industrial base. If everything went according to plan, the Allies felt confident that the war would end by Christmas 1944. It was an audacious plan that ultimately failed due to a number of reasons--including bad weather and a failure to take into account the quality of German troops--and cost thousands of British and American lives. Richard Attenborough decided to make a film about the failed operation in the 1970s; the result is this nearly three hour film. Some people refer to this film as \\"A Movie Too Long,\\" which I must admit is painfully true in some respects. A recent viewing exposed a number of flaws I missed when I watched this twenty years ago.<br /><br />Operation Market Garden, the military name for this daring plan formulated by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, sent in the American 82nd and 101st airborne divisions along with the British XXX and 1st airborne to accomplish this complicated task. Unfortunately, military forces were unable to reach the bridge at Arnhem, the bridge too far, that would have led them into Germany. They bogged down instead thanks to a mass of German panzers that prevented British resupply and reinforcements. After nine days the remnants of the British forces pulled out and the operation ended. American troops took heavy casualties as well in their attempts to take a couple of other bridges. This is a short meatball summary of what occurred in Operation Market Garden that I pulled off the Internet in about five minutes. In reality, it's complicated stuff for the layperson to understand, and the movie doesn't make it very easy to follow along once the bullets start flying and the shells start exploding. Yet the film has its compelling points. Just the idea of attempting to recreate such a massive operation is so ambitious as to exhaust anyone even thinking about putting it on film. But Attenborough gives it the old college try. We should admire him for his efforts.<br /><br />Think about all of the egos Sir Richard had to massage on the various sets. You've got Dirk Bogarde in the role of Lt. General Frederick Browning, the man in charge of setting up the massive operation. Sean Connery pops up as Maj. General Roy Urquhart, and we all know Connery isn't the easiest chap to work with. Edward Fox delivers a \\"win one for the Gipper\\" type speech to the troops as Lt. General Brian Horrocks, Elliot Gould overacts as Major Julian Cook, and Jimmy Caan orders a doctor to look at his wounded buddy in a way that would make Alan Alda weep with sympathy. Anthony Hopkins turns in a solid performance as Lt. Colonel John Frost, Laurence Olivier plays Dutch physician Jan Spaander, Robert Redford paddles up a river while taking heavy fire as Major Julian Cook, Michael Caine is Lt. Colonel Joe Vandeleur, and Ryan O'Neal is American Brigadier General James Gavin. My favorite performance comes from Gene Hackman in the role of Polish General Stanislaw Sosabowski. I groaned when I learned about his role beforehand, but Hackman does a great job playing a Pole. He's one of the few guys involved in the operation actually questioning the wisdom of what's going on. And his men eventually take casualties too when they attempt a night crossing over a river. Irwin Allen, eat your heart out!<br /><br />\\"A Bridge Too Far\\" has someexcellent battle reenactments. I have several favorites. The exchange between German tank and artillery placements with the Allies on the road to Arnhem is fantastic. They even send in a few planes to drop some bombs! When you listen to this on DVD with a great sound system, prepare to stuff some cotton in your ears. The British attempts to repulse the German tanks rolling in over that bridge look pretty darn good as well. I sure as heck wouldn't want to be that chap strolling across the bridge armed with an umbrella. That scene where the British soldier runs out to retrieve a supply pod dropped by a plane only to fall when struck by a sniper's bullet is one of many scenes that helps keep the film from losing emotional perspective. Aside from the combat sequences, I also appreciated the film's portrayal of the German side of the campaign. Instead of falling back on the old cinematic standby of showing any German in World War II as a raging megalomaniac, the movie tries to present a fair picture of how they countered the Allied attack.<br /><br />Hmmm. Looking back at what I've written, I guess I have to say I enjoyed the film more than I thought. I'm still going to deduct a star for what I feel was a failure on the part of Attenborough to tighten the film through rigorous editing. I suspect he worried endlessly about what to leave in and what to leave on the cutting room floor since the omission of even one or two scenes could have thrown the whole film into confusion. But some stuff should have gone out the window. Too bad we only get a trailer as an extra...some excellent battle reenactments. I have several favorites.

B00005JMUL|3.0|Okay, so G-rated does not truly mean the movie is for everyone.  My three year old got through it okay, but, believe it or not, found Polar Express more frightening than the Scooby Doo 2 movie.    For adults, this is a typical feel-good story that grapples with the 7-10 year old crowd's struggle between no longer believing in fairy tales, but continuing to believe in the magic of life.  The protaganist does learn to BELIEVE--but believe what?  Viewers can make up their own answers, but, my sense is he's to have faith in life and love and the notion that good begets good.  Ultimately, Polar Express complies obediently to the Walt Disney doctrine:  All magic, no religion.    On the positive side:  The other children's characters are realistic, and it's good to see the bright but uncertain young girl learn to lead, and the know-it-all kid learn to follow.  The poor child who, at far too young an age, becomes cynical, finally finds goodness.  This is sweet stuff.    Bottom-line:  Polar express is the ultimate mediocre Christmas tale.  It has good but obvious lessons to teach, fun graphics, and a fair level of action.  It's a bit much for the under six crowd.  There's so much to choose from in the Christmas movie genre, that this one probably deserves a pass.  My own bias is in favor of movies that at least hint at the spiritual nature of the season.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This 4-disc-DVD set is awesome ! <br />Even there are two ours of footage missing, we should be happy with what this DVD-box delivers.  <br />I also would have liked to see the whole set of George Thorogood and The Destroyers. And i knew the Led Zep's performance wasn't really the best on that day.  <br />But all in all, i don't give a damn about it  - The booklet clearly explaines why some parts were not included or available. <br /> <br />The Sets of The Who, Bryan Adams, Pretenders, Dire Straits, David Bowie, Elton John (also performing with Kiki-Dee and George Michael) and Mick Jagger with Tina Turner are really enjoyable.  <br />I like Elvis Costello's rendition of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The stand out performances are propably U2 and Queen: <br /> <br />U2 rocking great with Bloody Sunday and playing a superb version of Bad. Bono dancing with a girl from the audience !! !!  <br />This is really a memorable moment of the day. <br /> <br />And Queen, playing the most energetic set of the day, with the incomparable Freddie Mercury commanding wembley and the world through a stunning 20-minute-performance. <br /> <br />Buy this for the great performances and for the good cause ! <br />
B000053ZRR|3.0|Bon Jovi gave a good performance as they always do. I bought this for some of the songs I didnt have from other concerts. <br />It was a bit subdued though compared to the wonderful Bon Jovi 'Live in London' one which I found infinitely more full of life. <br />I think the auduience were a lot of the problem. Shots of the front rows show fairly impassive faces and not a lot of joining in - one even was seen to check their watch (well it was a Swiss audience!) <br />It would have been hard to feel psyched up and carried along by this crowd (as they were in London)- though perhaps they felt there wasnt much to get excited about.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Must have seen this movie first in about 1944 or 45. I remember the Merry Men falling off the trees on top of the Norman thugs, and knocking them to the ground; also the bobbing tin hat in the final punch-up being removed, to collect a nice thwack from a merry mace; and the thin, sneering features of the evil Sir Guy. Have seen it many times since then, of course, and now I've got this terrific dvd I'll see it many times in the future.  It is possible to criticise this film, but any fault-finding would be completely pointless. Forget it, this is the best there is or ever will be. Gee, I wish I could be Errol Flynn. Even the name swashes with buckle. Was that really Basil Rathbone's real name ? It positively seethes with dastardness. What man wouldn't dream of melting within those soft, sweet contours of ultra-beautiful Olivia ? This is a film that glows with the kind of political correctness that will always matter, not the piles of garbage that are served up today.
0385508417|2.0|In this lightweight story, Nora and Luther Krank's daughter has left home to join the Peace Corps, so they decide to do without all the fuss that goes along with celebrating Christmas and go on a relaxing cruise instead.  Their decision is met with disbelief, curiosity, and even hostility by their neighbors, who always decorate their homes alike and can't understand the Krank's decision to opt-out of the usual lights, tree, cards, parties, and gifts.  The Kranks are firm in their resolve, however, and are eagerly anticipating their Caribbean vacation, when their daughter arrives on Christmas Eve (complete with a new finance) expecting all the usual trimmings. What are they going to do - go on the cruise as planned or run around like mad people fixing up the house for Christmas?  Well, of course, we all know the answer to that one.<br /><br />This story is so predictable and corny that I was amazed John Grisham wrote it.  It can easily be read in one sitting and has absolutely no surprises or drama or honest emotion.  The humor is only mildly amusing at best, and the book reads like a half-hour sit-com script, full of pratfalls, non-stop, manic action, and stereotypical characters we don't really like or care about.  While many reviewers clearly enjoyed \\"Skipping Christmas,\\" I found it a silly book.<br /><br />Kona
B000003S0K|5.0|Best when loud.  Lyrics are great, structures of compositions perfect, sound quality of original recording muddy (only draw back).

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Well, I must have been one of the 2 or 3 people who had never seen Live Aid.  Heard about it, just never seen it.  Ironically, I grew up very attached to music.  So, I was not going to pass up the chance to get this DVD.   <br /> <br />First off, I will be the first to say that there is a lot on this DVD set that simply does not interest me.  Maybe 4-6 performances per disc are all that I seem to enjoy.  But what I learned from this DVD was invaluable.  The segments from the BBC broadcasts that explains the famine and destitution that strike Ethiopia were eye openers as to what others are going through in life.  When I read the booklet included with the DVD and watched my favorites from each disc, it was as if I had just been through a well deserved history lesson.  We should not be blind to these horrors simply because they aren't afflicting us. <br /> <br />Honestly, I felt proud after watching this.  Proud that humanity still exists, proud that these artists donated their time, proud that I now understand better what is going on in other parts of the world.  This DVD truly is historical and documents the power of us all. <br />
0972169504|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest comic strips on graduate school. Jorge Cham brings some of his own insights from his time at Stanford and all that hits close to home. The comic might have a slightly niche audience as I can imagine that it might be hard for an outsider to get some of the humor. The strip is immensely popular though among grad audidence and you can see the latest comic pasted on notice boards or across the lab windows or even outside the offices of profs themselves. I feel every one in grad school can relate to at least one of the characters in the strip, and of course compare their advisor to Prof Smith ;). Just about to finish up grad school, I have come to really relate to Cecilia, Tajel, Slackernery and of course the Nameless One, and I feel I'll take a lot from each of them with me as I leave school.

B000002P5W|5.0|This album right here is the most overlooked out Jimi's three studio albums, but it is just as good as both \\"Are You Experienced\\" and \\"Electric Ladyland\\" despite what you may commonly hear. Once the first note is played on \\"Up from the Skies\\", not a minute is wasted on this intense and concise album. I think that both \\"Are You Experienced\\" and \\"Electric Ladyland\\" are nearly twice as long as this album. This album is so thoroughly good though that you're left wanting for nothing after listening to it (except perhaps another listen). This album is also the most fun album that The Experience ever recorded. The second song, \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" is just high powered, high octane rock & roll with extremely crafty, thoughtful and creative lyrics. This is one of my favorite Jimi Hendrix songs of all time. The next song, \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" just has a really fun and energetic feel to it. The high energy continues with the next song, \\"Ain't No Telling\\". Listen out for the drummer on this song because he absolutely kills it. The drummer for The Experience doesn't get nearly enough credit but he is absolutely amazing in his own right. \\"Little Wing\\" is just a beautiful slice of dreamy guitar bliss with some of the most personal and intimate lyrics that Jimi has ever written. \\"If 6 was 9\\" is almost like a thematic continuation of \\"Stone Free\\" off of their first album. Jimi declares his independence and says that he is going to be himself no matter what people may think. \\"You Got Me Floatin\\" comes back full force with the fun, high octane, rock & roll. \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" is a mid-tempo song with visionary lyrics that are chocked full of practical wisdom. \\"She's So Fine\\" was penned by Noel Redding and it's actually one of the best songs on the album. It's fairly simple, but it's overflowing with fun energy. \\"One Rainy Wish\\" is absolutely the most lyrically impressive song on this album. The words and the music are just absolutely beautiful--a romantic, starry-eyed masterpiece. \\"Little Miss Lover\\" is just wickedly funky. The title track is in a similar vein as the magnificent \\"Little Wing\\". He takes us below the surface again on this one. I encourage you all to overlook the fact that this album often gets overlooked because you will be rewarded with a truly magnificent piece of music if you give it a chance.ce. \\"Little Miss Lover\\" is just wickedly funky.

B000002H4C|5.0|When I first saw the film in 1981, I rushed out to by the LP soundtrack. Over the years it has lost none of its sheer listening enjoyment. Naturally the cd is an improvement in sound quality over the LP.<br /><br />This soundtrack really captures the movie's hugely enjoyable OTT ebullience. All the tracks in here can be listened to on multiple repeat plays. Cheap Trick's 'Reach Out' and 'I Must be dreamin' are both good. 'Radar Rider' is the stronger of the two Riggs tracks on the album. Stevie Nick's 'Blue Lamp' grows on you each time you play it, as does the Nazareth track 'Crazy (A suitable Case For Treatment). Chill out to Don Fagen's 'True Companion' and Don Felder's 'All Of You'.<br /><br />What is the best track on here - two contenders in my opinion:<br /><br />- Blue Oyster Cult's superb 'Veteran Of the Psychic Wars' Was this track ever released as a single, if not why not?<br /><br />- Don Felder's Heavy Metal, mean, moody, and magnificent track. Slow build up to a crescendo, and then it just winds back down again to a graceful fade out.<br /><br />Frankly it's a tie, both songs are too good to put into second place.<br /><br />Get this cd for that drive into work, guaranteed to make it a somewhat more enjoyable experience.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise, Reise is a great album to listen to, if you are eclectic. This album contains many different sounds, like snare drums in Reise Reise and Mein Teil, accordians in Reise, Reise and Moskau, lots of synthesizing in most of the songs, like Reise, Reise,  Keine Lust, and Amour, for example. The album is also wonderful as Till can sing in not only German, but English. He even sings with the Russian girl (Viktoria, I believe) and says ??? ??? ???, which is amazing. And amour is French, so a total of four languages are sung. The bilingual songs, like Amerika and Moskau are among my favourites, as I am learning to become a translator. Rammstein has, since I learned about them in 2001, helped me with linguistics. Oh, and Olli sings, too. Great Album, Vielen Dank, Rammstein. Ich hore immer ihre Musik zu!

B0002XL35G|5.0|(I must give multiple mea culpas to anyone who read this review and didn't understand it. I have tried here, as of September 2010, to make it worth reading.<br />Thanks.)<br /><br />AS FAR AS THE FILM ITSELF:<br />I will not try to give too much away, but please understand, this movie has that rare kind of intensity.<br /><br />I was alone and divorced living in Yakima, Washington in 1990. I had nothing, was barely working part-time, drinking a lot and didn't care about the future. I felt the world collapsed around me, and I was never going to get beyond what limitations I had chained to myself so badly it took several years to let it all go.<br /><br />Then one day I went to the video store and rented this movie.<br /><br />I was simply interested in Harry Dean Stanton, who had also made in 1983/84 one of my favorite films \\"Repo Man\\" as the rough repo cop Bud. I thought it might it have some bite to it, so I slipped the VHS tape in and sat back in the one chair I could fit in my tiny kitchenette apartment and watched it.<br /><br />I was blown away. Wim Wenders had reached into my life and put it on the TV screen. There Harry was (as 'Travis') at the beginning of the film, wandering under the vast open skies and desert in the hot Texas sun alone as he drinks from a small jug of water. He is literally wandering in the desert, and really heading in no direction.<br /><br />A local sheriff finds him, and after questioning him (Travis doesn't answer), he goes through his clothes and finds a slip of paper with his brother Walt's (Dean Stockwell) number. Walt comes to get him and we find out that he has been missing for 4 years. He takes Travis back to LA with him where we now see his 7 year old son Hunter, who was abandoned there by Travis' wife, is curious to know who he is.<br /><br />We find Travis is a disaster, and emotionally vacant to everyone, even Hunter. The film takes us on an emotional rollercoaster as the mysteries unfold of what he may or may not have done in his past, what he wanted to do with his life and his motivations to put his family back together are slowly and painfully revealed.<br /><br />He is clearly still haunted by the memories of his past, but still wants to make things right. All he wants is a piece of land to re-build his childhood home, and to be happy. This idea has brought him to a personal crossroad.<br /><br />Travis leaves with Hunter to go find his ex-wife Jane, who may have run off to Los Angeles to be an actress, and after spending a brief time in Hollywood, he finally finds out where she is and finds out she is living in Houston. He takes off once again to confront her (and she is played all too briefly by Nastassja Kinski).<br /><br />The last 20 minutes of the film is soul-wrenching, and in one of the most emotionally revealing conversations I've ever seen put on film, Travis and Jane finally confront each other - sort of. (You have to see the scene to understand it, I won't spoil THAT.)<br /><br />I watched this film over and over, watching the silent pain and hope of the redemptive face of Travis, how he never had any kind of voice in how he felt about things in the first place, and the resulting upheaval when he re-enters his son Hunter's life, among other failures. I felt what he felt as he tried to regain anything that resembled a life, and still loved his ex-wife, and dearly loved his son. I was living this life onscreen.<br /><br />Wim Wenders had realized his glorious love for all things Western and Harry Dean Stanton deserved an Oscar for his performance.<br /><br />This movie is very slow in pace, so unless you actually have the patience of the sints, than this film is not for you. It's cerebral, and thought-provoking, and the visuals are stunning, and even though the plot is hard for many to get into, I understood it from the very beginning,<br /><br />It's okay because it's about Travis trying to pick up the pieces of all of the hearts he has broken (including his own) and gluing them back together again. It's haunting and sad and will make you weep if you've EVER have been in a situation of unresolved relationships and heartache.<br /><br />The music score by Ry Cooder is sad, billowy, and floats you over the dried yellowed land, carrying you along as the silent stoic visuals of the Old West are brought alive and complimented by him. Wenders (and to a almost lesser extent David Lynch) had that kind of cerebral touch in the late 80's and early 90s. You knew it existed, but you never knew what it was until you went off the beaten path and around the safe corner.<br /><br />This movie haunted my life for several years after I first watched it. It made me sit in corner ponder my own existence, and my own part in my own reality. It was a personal hazy reflection of my life in the early 90s and it still makes me kinda sad to watch.<br /><br />As for me? After 1993 I left Yakima (and sadly, my son, but he didn't need to see a drunk), went back home to Chicago and I have been somewhat happier since. My son and I get along very well and my time in Hell on earth is over. I'll be honest, seeing this film put a mirror to my face and really woke me up. I have kept a copy near me for years now, but don't watch it as much. Maybe it's now because the film did what did for me, and it doesn't anymore.<br /><br />I know in the world there are people still out there like Travis, and Jane, and Hunter, who are hurting bad and are looking for the answer to healing, hope and redemption. I was lucky. Will this film help them? Only if they want it to.<br /><br />ANYWAY... AS FAR AS THE DVD SPECIFICATIONS GO:<br />This is 1:75:1 and enhanced for widescreen TV. The sound is a fresh Dolby 5.1 and is crisp and clear. There are two extras featured: a deleted scenes section, and a optional commentary throughout the film with Wenders himself.<br /><br />Together, 20th Century Fox has given us a DVD worth owning for the price of a case of good beer. If I met myself back in 1990 when I first saw this, I'd go up to myself, buy us some beers and let him rent the movie, and together we'd watch the film and try to get through it without falling apart.<br /><br />For some people this may be too \\"visceral\\" of an experience, and yes it can be slow in a LOT of places, but it's supposed to be, because the pace is set up for you to take in each and every subtle nuance of this story!<br /><br />I get it, I got it, and now I hope you get it, too.

B00005JN4O|5.0|One reviewer here suggests that you should not seek out the \\"true\\" story of how Peter Pan came to be made, because if you do, and then compare the true story to this movie, your enjoyment of Finding Neverland will decrease significantly. I must respectfully disagree with that. Yes, there were a few facts that were fudged - but that's all, just a few. The core of both stories is the same: how an adult came to find a muse within children, and to use his inspiration to write a genre breaking play that gave the world one of the most endearing characters in all of fiction. <br /> <br />Unlike many who have posted reviews, I have never been overly fond of Johnny Depp. However, that was not the case in this film. I've seen countless films of his, and enjoyed them on one level or another, but his personal involvement never affected me in a positive way. The perfect example for this is Chocolat, easily one of my favorite films, but I could have taken or left Johnny Depp. Finding Neverland has changed my opinion of Mr. Depp entirely, and I now count myself one of his fans. His performance was so understated, so sublime, so perfect that he made an admirer out of me. It takes an amazing performance to do such a thing, and this was an amazing performance. <br /> <br />Kate Winslet was Kate Winslet: without fault, capable of evoking emotion with a simple cough. The moment she appeared on the screen seemed almost to be the beginning of the film. Rather - the moment her character and her character's children appeared on film was when it really began <br /> <br />Winslet and Depp had terrific chemistry on screen - in fact, they may have had too much. They looked so good when they were together, that it seemed as if they should have been husband and wife. I kept expecting them to get together, but since one of the fudged facts is that Winslet's character's husband was still alive during all of this, that was impossible. <br /> <br />The film did a wonderful job showing something thatwould have been highly frowned upon in today's society. A grown man, spending all of his time with children? There may have been a restraining order placed upon him with today's sensibilities. Thankfully, yesterday wasn't today. <br />
6305603847|5.0|This film explores the effect a terrible childhood, bad experiences with relationships and too many drugs can have on you. All through the wonderfull music of Pink Floyd. While it's not contemporary in that the story is told in little to no dialogue but instead by the music and images. If you are a fan of cult films, classic rock, or good movies this movie is definitely worth a try. Oh and by the way you don't have to be high to understand it! I love it and hopefully you will too! <br />Either way check it out.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Some movies are dazzling in their originality and style, while others merely borrow from better films. Sadly, Sky Captain is the latter. While this film is luminously photographed, it doesn't contain one iota of originality in its threadbare script. Perhaps my sights were set to high, hoping for a loving tribute to films like Metropolis. But even if they were lower, I still might have balked to see a leather-uniformed, eye patch wearing Angelina Jolie giving orders to the \\"amphibious squad\\". Throughout this movie I was literally counting the films which it ripped off. I suppose they were somehow hoping if you put all the parts of successful movies together, you might end up with a winner yourself. Unfortunately all you end up with is a beautifully photographed mess.
B00004XPPB|5.0|With all of the gangster films that have come out over the years my first reaction to \\"Donnie Brasco\\" was \\"Oh, no!  Not another one!\\"  Mike Newell's film is an original addition to a genre that has been mined many times but as proven here still has some life to it.  Johnny Depp portrays Joe Pistone, an F.B.I. operative who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob using the alias Donnie Brasco.  He is taken under the wing by Lefty Ruggiero(Al Pacino), a mob lifer who has spent his career on the fringes of the organization without being made.  Through this association Pistone gains access to other aspects of the mob.  The film deftly portrays the pressures that Pistone faces from his activities undercover and the strain that it is putting on his home life.  Also, you can a sense that Pistone is starting to enjoy his life as Donnie Brasco.  Depp adds another great character to his evergrowing gallery of great performances without overplaying it.  Pacino, who has assayed this genre many times, gives a low-keyed effective performance.  One can feel a sense of empathy for his character for all the disappointments in his life.  Michael Madsen also delivers a chilling performance as mobster Sonny Black.
B00005JMJG|5.0|It's hard to think of enough good things to say about this movie. I have been an increasing fan of Charlie Kaufman for many years now. A problem I have had with him, however, is that his scripts are more cerebral than emotional. It is odd that he has finally made an extremely emotionally engaging movie by literally making it all about the cerebrum. This movie profoundly states that with love comes a whole lot of alienation, anguish, boredom and resentment, then asks the question \\"Even with all that, isn't it still worth it?\\" I have seen a lot of relationship movies, but I have yet to find one which so accurately nails modern romance the way this one does. I could watch it forever.
B0000640S1|4.0|When Sylvester Stallone's name comes up it's usually with derision.  He's generally dismissed as an actor and the over-inflated killing machine of \\"Rambo\\" is brought up.  People tend to forget that at the time \\"First Blood\\" came out Stallone had carved himself a nice little career as an actor.  He had the success of the first \\"Rocky\\" film under his belt, and \\"F.I.S.T.\\" and \\"Nighthawks\\" were pretty good films.  \\"First Blood\\", despite the body count does have a cogent message.  John Rambo is a returning Vietnam vet who is being harrassed by the local police force in a Pacific Northwest town.  They subject him to all sorts of degradation before he finally snaps.  What the constabulary do not realize is that Rambo is no mere vagrant, that he was trained by the Marine Special Forces and that the rules of engagement are ingrained in him whether it be the bush in Vietnam or back on the homefront.  Stallone, aside from his skills as an action star, gives a sympathetic portrayal here.  The acting is generally good.  Brian Dennehy gives dimension as the sheriff that could have been one-note.  A young David Caruso appears as a deputy.  Richard Crenna's role as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's commanding officer, is a little one-dimensional.  He basically appears as kind of a Greek chorus as to the havoc that Rambo can do.
B000002UWF|5.0|I bought this CD because \\"That Old Black Magic\\" was always one of my favorites.  I had heard that Prima was pretty good but I wasn't familiar with the level of his (and his band's) talent.  This CD blew me away the first time I heard it and it lifts me up every time I play it.  Prima and his band have a lively sound and they obviously have a good time producing it.  I saw, from the liner notes, that they were billed \\"the wildest show at Tahoe\\" and I can believe it.  I'm only sorry that I never had the occassion to see this act live. <br /> <br />The songs on this CD are almost all very good.  In fact, the ones I didn't care for that much (\\"Banana Split\\", \\"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\\") probably can be found on someone else's favorites list.  The ones that I really livened up to were \\"Just a Giolo-Ain't Got Nobody\\", \\"Oh Marie\\", \\"When You're Smiling\\", \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" and \\"Angelina-Zooma Zooma\\".  I pared that list down leaving off a lot of other great ones (including \\"That Old Black Magic\\").  Listen to these and you'll feel the excitement of music. <br /> <br />I have bought other Prima CD's since this one and I have enjoyed them but they do not come close to the beginning to end quality that there is on this CD.  If chamber music is your thing then you're not even reading this review.  If you want to jump, jive, and wail, THIS is the music for you!
B00005QDW1|5.0|I loved this band from the first time I heard Tragic Kingdom. Gwen Stefani has a voice you're either going to get into or not. I happen to think it's great. She puts so much drama into just a single lyric. I knew Don't speak was destined to become a classic from the very first time I heard it. The rest of the band rocks to the hilt. All the songs have a great techno/rock feel. I still listen to this CD everyday. It's uplifting and  full of hi-enrgy. No Doubt will still be making great music for a long time to come, while the other teeny bopper bands on the current scene fade into the sunset.
1577311523|1.0|Negating everything that makes us uniquely human, powerful, capable and successful in the name of enlightenment is oxymoron which no thinking person would settle for.  Its old news, commercialized version of the spiritual process designed to alleviate the anguish of being a thinking person whose natural inclination is to produce but who lacks the merit and will to do so, and so resigns himself to the formulaic trash doctrine of obliterating thier mind in the interest of a soul yet undeveloped.. Soul searching is a a process of the mind, not a process to obliterate it.  Its nothing but a recipe to return to the comfort of a maternal woumb where you will not feel the agitation or anxiety of real growth.  Live in the now he said, just as the animals do.  Planning, thinking, and learning from the past and living for the future is the joy of now. The author should take his own advice live in the now, and refrain from planning for his future career as writer.
B000001OAA|5.0|I first heard Garbage on MTV's Alternative Nation in 1995 witht he song \\"Queer\\". For some reason, the song didn't hit me right off. Then, when \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" came out, that's what got me into them. I went out and bought this record, and definitely got into it, even \\"Queer\\" became a great song. <br /> <br />I like the fact that this album has a bit of something for everyone. Track by track review: <br /> <br />1. Supervixen - Kind of grainy and raw sounding, but more of a rock song. One of the more aggressive tracks on the album. <br /> <br />2. Queer - This one's a little more mellow. It's not mellow enough to say it doesn't have an edge, but it is mellow enough to where you could kind of chill to it. <br /> <br />3. Only Happy When It Rains - This is definitely an alt-rock song. A lot less of the electronic style, and more guitar driven. Pretty upbeat with depressing lyrics. <br /> <br />4. As Heaven Is Wide - This one is my favorite on the album! It's got more of a darker industrial feel. Sometimes, you'll read about Garbage having some styles of industrial in their music, and this is one of the songs that would better show that. Pretty moody, dark lyrics, great music to dance or drive to. <br /> <br />5. Not My Idea - Probably the most pop song of the album. My least favorite, but still a great one. Very catchy though. <br /> <br />6. A Stroke Of Luck - This song is great because while it's mellow, it's pretty dark in its sound. It's like a song that you could have a different opinion to. Some would find it sexy, some would find it depressing, and some would find it just kind of ambient and relaxing. <br /> <br />7. Vow - Kind of abrasive in lyrics. It's got a upbeat dancy feel, but is a little rough sounding. This is probably my second favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />8. Stupid Girl - I like this song because it's got that alt-rock thing going, but still infuses a lot of the electronic sound as well. Pretty dancy and just pretty fun all around. <br /> <br />9. Dog New Tricks - This one's another one that has more of an industrial-type feel to it. Again, pretty moody, but also rather catchy. The lyrics compliment it rpetty well. <br /> <br />10. My Lover's Box - Like A Stroke Of Luck, people have different opinions on this. I find Shirley's vocals to be really sexy sounding on this song. It's pretty melodic, but still kind of dark. I swear it sounds like it's getting louder at the end, which can be a bit annoying at times. <br /> <br />11. Fix Me Now - To me, this is the most depressing track on the album. This one focuses more on the guitar again. Melodic song, but definitely on a more lower sad scale. <br /> <br />12. Milk - I have to say the milk reference to me always took away a bit of the seriousness to this song. Whatever suits you, I guess. Anyway, a very mellow track, dark, sexy, longing for something that isn't there anymore. <br /> <br />So there you go. Pick up the record.
B000092Q7O|5.0|This is undoubtedly one movie that will stay with me for a long time. Adrien Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman was definately oscar worthy. The story is a touching reminder of what humans are capable of acheiving when fighting for survival. The fact that the film is directed by Roman Polanski who lived in the nazi 'era' made the story all the more real to the viewers. I also liked the way the story was told in that there were good and bad Jews, Poles and Germans. Often in the past one side was 'all bad' and the other side was 'all good.'
078401213X|1.0|Another movie that tries to appeal to the growing mainstream of pseudo-intelectuals who are just a bunch of losers. The photography is grainy and in many scenes the camera moves around too much. The story itself is very decadent. The movie ridicularizes the attempt of humankind to understand the world. It is suggested that only the simpleminded can find happiness. So, if you think you are smarter than other people, and think that that superiority is the cause for your problems and your sad life you will probably like this movie. If you are not one of those people don't waste your time and money watching it.

B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast have produced 3 classics - this, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, and Aquemini. And this is probably the best of the 3, although their first album was hard to top.  This album is just some classic hiphop.  I dont know how better to describe it - you just have to get it to know for yourself.  Anyone without these 3 Outkast album i listed above cannot call themselves a \\"genuine\\" hiphop fan, if you haven't heard classic hiphop at it's best like this.  And if you think you are an Outkast fan, then you most definitely must have these 3 albums to call yourself an Outkast fan, because they are their best album, this one being my favorite.  Best tracks here, well every track is fire, but my favorites are Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), ATLiens (the best song here), Ova da Wudz, Wailin' (which has one of the best beats ever), and Mainstream which is probably my favorite song.  If you haven't got this album yet, you are probably some eminem and 50 cent commercial pop rap fan, because all true rap/hip-hop fans will already have this.

B00005JMAH|3.0|Compared to the previous two Potter films, Azkaban is superior in direction, script, scenery, cinamatography, visual effects,  and acting.  Alas it is also less entertaining and somewhat lifeless. Perhaps this is due to poor editing, as the story doesnt flow as seemlessly as the first two pictures.  the ending seemed very rushed as well.  The 3rd installment in the series of film adaptations lacks heart.
B000006045|5.0|i'm not going to go into how mezzanine is the tightest album ever made <br />because there are a lot of albums that i have not heard <br />and its ridiculous to suggest that there is nothing to compete <br />but i will say this. <br />mezzanine is the tightest album that i have heard. <br />and i have heard a relatively large amount of music. <br />it took a long time to get into <br />i am ashamed to say, i disdained it for many months - even after i got into protection, and then blue lines <br />it was too inaccessible for me <br />i don't know <br />i was young, foolish. <br />i now understand the error of my ways. <br />i listen to it regularly. <br />the worst day of my life was when someone stole my copy of it. <br /> <br />it is great music to write to, to ignore, to immerse oneself in, to make love to, to attempt to match as a musician and always fall short. <br />and, yes nothing else they have done compares. <br />(not to say that the other music they made wasn't tight) <br />i'm not going to go on about each of the individual tracks <br />i actually like the second half a lot, though, i will say that. <br />people tend to knock everything after inertia creeps, but the climax is in fact my favorite part. <br />what makes the album so good is not any of the particular tracks <br />but the overall experience that it is <br />it must be experienced as a whole. <br /> <br />that is all. <br /> <br /> <br />clear
B0006399FS|2.0|I am a long-time, big-time U2 fan and I am very disappointed with this CD.  Part of the reason may be in that the pre-release hype was that this CD would rock a little harder than the last couple of efforts.  It doesn't.  When I first heard Vertigo, I thought it was an okay tune, far from U2's best, but I still had hope for the CD.  There are some better songs than Vertigo on the CD, but in all the songs are fairly weak.  Most of the songs sound like they were rejected from early U2 albums.  You can hear hints of earlier works in many of the songs, but they just aren't as good as the earlier works.   <br /> <br />The biggest problem with the CD is that most of the songs are overproduced.  There is some good guitar, bass and drum work going on, but the solid musicianship is drowned out by too much irriating synthesizer effects, hallelujah choruses, and repetitive keyboard work.  The end result is that I feel like I am listening to the soundtrack of a Broadway musical.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Okay album.  There are some definite radio hits with LIKE A PRAYER, EXPRESS YOURSELF and CHERISH and the rest of the CD is surpringly dark.  I'm not sure why I was surprised, given that many of Madonna's past videos have involved dark subject matter, like blood, sex, death, crucifictions, etc. but for some reason I assumed her earlier albums would be fluffier.  Guess not.  All in all, not a bad album, although there was one song with Prince that seemed endless.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I've only heard 'Delicate' and 'The Blower's Daughter' in full, and based on the beauty of these two songs I plan to go out tomorrow and buy this album so I can listen to these two songs (and hopefully more like them) over and over again.
B000002KKD|2.0|I don't get the appeal.  I'm not even sure how to categorize this.  Surfing music on crack?  Whatever it is, it's too weird for l'il 'ol me, and that's all I really gotta say about that.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This film was always doomed from the start. Never has a Hollywood remake of a historical text ever worked, or ever lived up to expectations. I was hoping Troy would be a success, but instead I got a typical blockbuster mess.<br /><br />I think everyone knows the plot so I won't bore you explaining it. What I will talk about is the choice of looks, or fame, over acting credibility, which is most evident in the form of the pathetic Orlando Bloom. Ok, so all the little girls love him, but quite frankly all the little girls won't really be watching this film. He was laughable. His character Paris is meant to be weak at times, but not wooden, cheesy and ultimately melodramatic in ALL situations. Orlando added that in by himself. Brad Pitt was an acceptable Achilles, but again they went for aesthetics over acting, as he too appeared rather wooden at times, and once again lacked the vivacity and presence he displayed in his career-high point \\"Fight Club\\".<br /><br />On the upside, Eric Bana as Hector was very good and brought some realism into the film, with steady and believable acting. His down to Earth stytle boosted the film considerably, as did Peter O'Toole who put in another fine performance. Special mention should also go to Shaun Bean, who continues to revel in his smaller roles.<br /><br />The battle scenes, while good, are nothing new compared to Lord of the Rings. The final battle between Hector and Achilles was exciting, and for me the best part of the film.<br /><br />Overall Hollywood has really hashed this one up, with some exceptions. Missed opportunity.

0452282152|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring is a fascinatingly sensual yet honest portrayal of 17th century Holland.  While the novel doesn't focus closely on the life of the artist Vermeer, it focuses on the muse that Chevalier creates- a girl who is forced to leave her family to be a maid in a stranger's home.  It depicts scenes of such wrenching heartache but also a peculiar and intense sensuality that seems to ruminate on its pages without even trying to.  It's an incredible novel and one that blends both historical aspects and the fictional character that inspired the unknowingly controversial portrait of the Girl With a Pearl Earring.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|It is about time to get this film's definitive version.    I am Amazon user in Japan and already own the original LD release and huge, expensive DVD boxes(cost me about $1,0000.....), and I can assure you that this Criterion version will be \\"THE BEST\\" one.    While Japanese version was created from same new Hi-Definition transfer, all features, three-hour movie and 45minits documentary, are bundled in dual-layered disc, which is too much to take in one, and the sound bit rate is 338kbps instead of 448kbps.    I expect, likewise \\"Red Beard\\",\\"Hidden fortress\\" and \\"Ikiru\\", one disc will be devoted to the feature presentation and the extra to the other disc on Criterion version so that the quality can be maximized, and can be better than original Japanese release.    Still, among the Japanese original box set, I can say that the quality of \\"Sansiro Sugata\\" and two-disc set of \\"Seven Samurai\\" are great. I can't wait to see what the folks at Criterion will do to the rest of Kurosawa film releases.     P.S   For the first time, in documantary, Mr.Nakadai talks about taking over the title role from great Shintaro Katsu(Zatoich)who was originaly cast for Shingen and Kagemusha. Simply amazing.
B00064MW6A|4.0|O...........K.........A.........Y.... <br /> <br />First of all people are just hating on Halle, she was great in this movie. Okay maybe the script could have been a little bit better, but the movie was still great. People are talking about: oh my god. They should have continued the selina kyle story.  <br /> <br />For what? Where else could you possibly go with that story? Tell me, i would like to know. What if they did continue with the Selina Kyle story, only the movie sucked, then what? <br /> <br />It's nice to see every once in a while a comic book movie not all the way dedicated to the comic. Explore a little. Try something different, and that's exactly what Warner Bros did with this story. People come on! The only thing not so great was practically the story, everything else was great. <br /> <br />Plus Halle's catsuit was way better than Michelle's suit. <br /> <br />Catwoman in my point of view is a: sexy, sleek, stylish character. Not a sewed up dominatrix.  <br /> <br />I can't wait for the DVD because I am going to get it and I do think they should have released  the soundtrack. <br /> <br />I saw Catwoman 10 times, that's how much I loved that movie. It was more than just Halle's sexiness, it was just about time we see something different than what the comic originates.
0395389496|2.0|With all due respect to Chris Van Allsburg, who writes a decent children's story, I must say that I think all the five star ratings are somewhat over the top.  First of all, a book that was published only 19 years ago can hardly be called a \\"classic.\\"  Our pop culture has used that word so much and about so many things - even new things - that the word itself has become meaningless.  Second, the story itself is shallow.  It can be summarized as follows:  a boy doubts the existence of Santa Claus until a train picks him up at his house and takes him to the North Pole to see Santa and now he believes.  That's it, folks!  That's the entire story!  For all this talk about the \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"magical\\" quality of the book, I've just encapsulated the whole book in one sentence!  Any deep \\"lessons\\" taught in the story are obscured at worst, and shallow at best.  And that brings me to my third point.  I keep reading about how this story deals with the unreality of Santa, but the reality of the \\"spirit of Christmas.\\"  And yet not once has anyone actually said what the \\"real spirit of Christmas\\" is in this book.  That's just another feel-good phrase that has become trite.<br /><br />So, I give it two stars.  Not a bad book (the artwork is fantastic), but not a great one either.  Definitely overrated.  And by the way, I am a father of two young children, just in case anyone says that I won't understand the appeal of the book unless I actually have children of my own.  I have read the book to them a number of times, and we've also seen the movie.<br /><br />That's my review, for what it's worth.

B00063EMJG|5.0|Here is a further clarification on format which, though probably irrelevant to all but &#34;golden ears&#34; types, is worth mentioning. HDCD is effectively 20 bit encoding, not 16 bit, which is the CD standard. DVD-A is true 24 bit. DVD-A seems to add a touch of depth over HDCD, but frankly, I can hardly tell the difference between the HDCD and DVD-A layers of this set. Both are a welcome improvement over the origial CD versions, in part because of the advanced technology, but also because the tracks were impeccably remastered thanks to Neil Young's commitment to getting as close to true analog sound as possible with a digital medium.  Neil Young is apparently a supporter of HDCD and DVD-A, and has personally supervised the remastering of the Buffalo Springfield recordings in HDCD. The beauty of HDCD is that it is fully compatible with all CD and all DVD players; DVD-A will play satisfactorily in almost all DVD players, but will play in full 24-bit hi-res only on DVD-A enabled players. Because the Pacific Microsonics chip used to master in HDCD is so good, almost everything recorded in HDCD sounds better. However, technically, to get the extra bits that HDCD offers you need a player with an HDCD encoder. Denon makes one for about $299 (DCM 380). SACD is Sony's one-bit approach to high def mastering and is equal in quality to DVD-A. However, all of Sony's affordable players are SACD/CD only, apparently because it doesn't want to support the competing DVD-A technology. Since there is still so little hi-def stuff out there in any format, my advice is don't saddle yourself with an SACD only machine. Toshiba and Pioneer both make inexpensive machines &#60;$150 that play both SACD and DVD-A (but alas, do not include and HDCD decoder). I wonder if the commenter who claims to have compared the HDCD sound with the DVD-A sound using a Sony player was really listening to the DVD-A layer. The reason I wonder is that, as I said above, Sony does not support DVD-A. However, it'spossible that high-end Sony's might have both. I know the low-end ones that I can afford do not.
B000099T2L|5.0|There's no other way to describe this CD. Beyonce has the pipes and will go the distance. Too bad Mandonna is still making music. She's only digging a deeper hole for herself everytime she tortures the public with another mindless and awful recording of schlock. Beyonce rules!!!!
B0002TT0NW|3.0|I'll just go straight to the problem: <br />1)Professor Dumbledore, the new actor that is, doesn't look as wise nor talk as wise. He talks way too fast compared to the one we got use to, is probably shorter and smaller. The old Dumbledore, when he talks, its like something worth listening to, like a rare chat from someone really wise. The new guy isn't anything like it.  <br />2)During the movie Ron and Harry notice their other friend popping in without notice. From what I think, they made this subject too minor. What I mean is, they shoulda put in more scenes that would really have the viewers asking, wow whats going on here? Such as: Seeing her in two different places a few moments ago. The professor that gave it to her accidently spoke of it but told them not to ask it again. Etc, make the movie more mysterious. Even though this isn't in the book, shrug. <br />3)It seems like the book contained so many details etc, that the movie couldn't contain it successfully and miss out on a lot of important details that coulda made this movie a lot better. <br />4)The part where Harry was waiting for Peter, the guy that backstabbed his parents to Voldemort, out in the hallway at night, looking at his magical map. Coulda made it more dramatic. <br /> <br />There are a bunch of these flaws in the movie, these are just some, maybe they should take a break from making the movies, like the directors etc, are tired out. Thats all I gotta say I'm tired.
B000065V41|5.0|It's Christmas Eve, and Scrooge (Michael Caine) is busy counting money and evicting people who aren't paying their mortgages on time.  He reluctantly lets Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) and the rest of his staff have the day off.  But that night, his old partners, then three more ghosts, visit him.  Can they change his view of the world?<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect the first time I saw this movie.  Would the Muppets play it mostly straight or would they ruin one of my favorite Christmas tales.  I immediately fell in love with this version of the story.  It's got some great humor to it, but sticks very close to the story.  In fact, at least half of the movie is taken directly from the book, especially Gonzo's lines as Dickens.  The touches they make for this version are very powerful.  Yet there are lots of great jokes that make it impossible not to laugh the entire way through.  And some great songs enhance the movie.  While a few go on a little too long, there are a couple I'd buy the soundtrack for.<br /><br />This is a good DVD that could have been great.  The only real drawback is that the movie is cropped to full screen instead of sticking with the original wide screen version.  Other then that, the picture looks great, and the movie sounds great, too.  Director Brian Henson provides an interesting commentary that really opened my eyes to how they create Muppet movies.  There's also a 20 minute feature on the making of the film, some bloopers, and a very short segment on Christmas traditions around the world.<br /><br />While the full frame format is less then perfect, the movie itself is.  This is a fun take on a classic Christmas story that everyone in the family will love and will satisfy Dickens purists to boot.
B000069HJM|5.0|Gads, I can't believe all the whiners out there about Supertramp minus Rodger Hodgson. Look people here's a simple remedy - GET OVER IT ALREADY!!! They ain't never gonna get back together. And what makes you all such experts? I'm very certain Mr. Davies has moved on long ago. And what has Roger done lately? Not much. So, who has had more success? Supertramp minus Roger, duh!!! I say that not to take away from Roger (cause I like him too) but the obvious needs to be pointed out. Supertramp is great with or without him. I enjoy Rogers solo efforts and I really enjoy Supertramp without him. I also enjoyed Supertramp with him. This is no different than all the whiners about Pink Floyd minus Roger Waters. Grow up!!! Guess what? As a musician I should point out that musicians move on so should fans.
B000059XUI|3.0|Superman 2 was an ok sequel,except when the 3 villains from krypton made a major attack on a one horse town(what the heck was that all about?).That scene was horrible.Also the John Williams score was completely butchered.The plot itself was pretty good.Lois Lane discovers Clark's secret,falls in love with him,Clark gives his powers up for her,then the 3 kryptonian villians break from the phantom zone and wreak havoc on earth.Clark knows that somehow,he has to get his powers back,and does so through the kryptonian crystal that was put in his rocketship.They have a showdown in Metropolis,and Superman wins.I actually liked this movie alot more when I was a kid than I do now.In the late 1980's,on ABC,I saw the Richard Donner cut of Superman 2,and that changed everything.His version of this film was just awesome(just as good as the first Superman).In the Donner cut,Clark gets his powers back through his father.Jor-El gave up his soul to give his son his abilities back(Marlon Brando kept the producers from using his footage,because of legal issues).The Brando footage was not in the ABC broadcast,I just read about it.The relationship between Clark and Lois,and Lois' trouble dealing with knowing Clark's secret was written better, and had more detail.Also the small town attack is absent(GOOD!!).Unfortunately,the Donner cut is not out for release.Margot Kidder says that she believes the footage still exists.There are petitions on the web to get Donner's version released.Richard Donner,by the way,was the director of Superman and the original director of Superman 2.If you like Superman 2 now,you will LOVE Superman 2:The Donner Cut.
B000055Y0X|5.0|i bought this movie because of a friend's recommendation and i'm so glad that i did.  it took me a minute or two to get used to the tone of the whole movie, but once i was in, i couldn't escape.  this classic black comedy is amazing.  from the insane colonel that shuts down a whole military base and sends planes out to drop a nuclear payload on the russians, to protect our bodily fluids, to the crew of one of the planes doing the dropping that will do anything for their country, the cast of this movie is amazing.  dr. strangelove is one of the more memorable with his crazy hair and nazi-possessed right arm, he is probably one of the best characters ever to appear on film.  peter sellers plays three roles in this movie.  the president, dr. strangelove, and some army guy (sorry, i can't remember his name).  this movie is also James Earl Jones' big screen debut.  it came out in 1964 or 65 and is in black and white.  the acting is great and the comedy is darkly superb.  one of stanley kubrick's best.  buy it if you want to laugh your ass off.  and try to keep track of how many times plan R is brought up, it's a lot.

B00003CXCT|4.0|It's about time the Star Wars movies were released on DVD!  I saw that there are already a ton of reviews for this box set, but I will give my own thoughts anyway, since I have been a fan of these films for a long time.  The visual and audio quality of the movies on DVD format is superb.  Lucasfilm really made the effort to get the images and sounds to be crisp, clean, and vibrant, and it shows.  The commentaries for the movies are great because they include a lot by George Lucas himself.  In addition, the fourth DVD has an absolutely excellent and long documentary, Empire of Dreams, on the making of the movies.  With regards to packaging, a much, much, more sturdy outside box for the discs should have been used.  Also, the photomontage covers for the individual DVD cases look a bit tacky, especially since a lot of stunning poster art has been done for Star Wars over the years.  Some of them were used for the original VHS.  But it seems like the current design is meant to be consistent with the prequel DVD's.    This box set contains the Special Edition versions that were in theaters in 1997, with even more changes since.  Most of the changes to the story structure have been controversial.  I felt that the changes produced mixed results.  It would have been interesting if Lucas had included the original versions along with the Special Editions, allowing viewers to compare and contrast, similar to how Lord of the Rings has theatrical release DVD's and extended release DVD's.    Some thoughts on some of the alterations:    -I am one of those who felt that Han Solo should have shot Greedo first, like in the original version.  In the commentaries, Lucas explains that both Han and Lando transition from more of an \\"in-between side\\" to the \\"light side\\".  Having Han shoot first would have established his character more bluntly and made his character transition more stark and pronounced.  Also, Lucasfilm has tried to polish this scene since the 1997 release, but the editingstill looks a bit awkward and unnatural.    -The scene in A New Hope where Han meets Jabba the Hutt is redundant, especially since Han repeats dialogue and information from a previous scene.  In addition, Jabba could have just settled things right on the spot by capturing Han or just killing him off right then and there.    -I really liked the alterations made to the space battle at the end of A New Hope. A LOT of it was redone and the reshoots really update the look of the entire scene while remaining faithful to the choreography of the original shots.  They also make the battle seem faster and larger than in the original version.    -In A New Hope, the updating of the lettering on the Death Star tractor beam control panel into alien script was long overdue.  I had always wondered about modern written English being used a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.     -I thought that the changes made to The Empire Strikes Back were reasonable.  All of the effects shots look so much cleaner and many visual details of Cloud City were redone, making it into a more dynamic and busy place. The reshoot of the Emperor scene made sense with the use of Ian McDiarmid.  However, the new dialogue in the scene causes some confusion because it seems to contradict the fact that Vader already knows about Luke Skywalker by name from the beginning of the movie.  I have read various explanations online of what Lucas intended in this plot revision, whether Vader is faking ignorance in front of the Emperor or honestly doesn't know for sure.  But I think the audience has grown accustomed to thinking about the story in a particular way and is led to continue this way because the movie's opening scroll, which sets up the framework of the story, still remains unchanged.  Slightly rewording the opening scroll could have made Lucas's intentions for the revised plotline much more clear.       -New to the movies, Hayden Christensen now replaces Sebastian Shaw in the ghost scene in Return of the Jedi.  In the commentaries Lucas explains why he did this, that Anakin basically died and got replaced by Darth Vader, hence the appearance of Anakin as a young Jedi in ghost form.  I understand Lucas's concept and reasoning, but it ended up raising questions for me.  For example, are Anakin and Vader now meant to be seen as two totally different and separate characters?  If Luke Skywalker sensed some good in Vader, then wouldn't this mean that Anakin isn't truly dead and gone?  Who is in the Vader suit at the very end, \\"Anakin\\" or \\"Vader\\"?  If it is finally Anakin once again, then shouldn't it be the mature Anakin who appears in ghost form?  The answers were made very clear in the original version with Sebastian Shaw.  Nevertheless, I thought the use of Christensen was a very interesting interpretation.    Overall, if you don't mind the more contentious alterations done over the years, then you really should get this DVD set.  Definitely get the silver-boxed Widescreen Edition.  Star Wars is still a real thrill to watch!
B0002TT0NM|5.0|Anyone who says this film was not good because it strayed from the book needs to go post their opinion on a Harry Potter website, because that is not an idea that matters when it comes to whether or not a film was good. This movie got MUCH better reviews from critics as it was a movie of much better quality. The previous movies attempted to retell the story in less time than it needed, so things got jumbled and the movie turned into a children's movie. Cuaron is a much more imaginative director, which is needed for a Harry Potter movie.  <br /> <br />Oh, and read the end of that last sentence - \\"a Harry Potter MOVIE.\\"  <br /> <br />HP fans need to realize that the movies are not supposed to be carbon copies of the books in live action. It just wouldn't work. It'd be boring and corny... And as much as I liked the first two films because they were telling a great story - they were boring and corny. I've shown all three films to people who have never read the books, and gotten by far the best responses to the Prisoner of Azkaban. <br /> <br />So if anyone wants to know if this is a good movie, worth buying... Yes, it definitely is. No, it doesn't follow the story perfectly, but it tells what is needed to make a movie with the same spirit as a wonderful book. Both dark, amusing, and brilliant. This movie is the best of the three, and as a fan of movies, I truly hope Cuaron will come back for another movie down the line. His work is amazing.  <br /> <br />And anyone who says the books need to be followed as well as the Lord of the Rings movies followed their books obviously hasn't read the books. Great movies, but they didn't follow the book at all. And someone tell me you weren't bored to tears at some point during the trilogy and/or disgusted by the end of the third movie and I'll say you never even watched the movies.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I must part company with so many who think this album is \\"better\\" than the Phil Spector produced \\"Let It Be\\" (which, as a number of reviewers have observed, Spector only left his fingerprints on half the record, not the rooftop concert on top of Apple Corps).  Honestly, the Spectorized \\"Let It Be\\" has been part of our collective memory for almost 35 years, the layered strings dubbed into \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" have that uncanny \\"the long and winding road has come to an end for the fab four\\" feeling of nostalgia and regret at what might have been had they remained together. <br /> <br />Yes, Paul (who is vastly underrated in comparison to John; Paul had a much more consistent and productive solo career, and his albums with Wings have that trademark Beatle flavor missing in so much of John's work) had a bad taste left in his mouth by Spector's \\"over\\"production. So did Johnny Ramone after Spector helmed their 1980 release, \\"End of the Century.\\"  Yet, you've gotta admit, his \\"wall of sound\\" was like riding in a plushly upholstered Lincoln. I mean, who wouldn't want to ride in a Lincoln, listening to the Beatles? <br /> <br />All that said, this is the album that was pretty much meant to be. So, in that regard I am very pleased that Paul's wishes were religiously adhered to. It is not often artists get a chance at redemption, and so with John and George gone, it is heartening to know that their memories have been posthumously honored. (I wish I could say the same for John about his solo work: Yoko Ono's strip mining of his tapes is an afront to his legacy -- she even turned his doodling into baby clothes and furniture, the John Lennon \\"Imagine\\" line. No kidding!) <br /> <br />Yes, this current CD mixes many different takes of the songs, but so what: The Beatles were pioneers in looping, editing, backward masking (!), and multitrack recording. Often, when they were pissed off at each other, John and Paul would record their instrumentals and vocals separately, as would George, the quiet Beatle of largely untapped talent. <br /> <br />So, it doesn't bother me that \\"Down Let Me Down\\" is an amalgam of different strands of ferrous oxide coated Mylar(r). I was quite impressed by the \\"new\\" version of \\"Long and Winding Road\\" with the Billy Preston organ solo, and especially pleased with \\"I Dig a Pony,\\" \\"Get Back\\" and the spliced \\"I, Me, Mine.\\"  <br /> <br />However, I gave it a four-star rating -- not a five -- because this was a four-star record in the first place. It lacks the cohesiveness of their middle period albums \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Peppers...\\" Their end started with the White Album and culminated with this and \\"Abbey Road,\\" all three albums that exhibited musical invention and branching out, but which seemed a bit distracted. As the Beatles grew apart, they seemed to harmonize less, and songs became either \\"John\\" songs or \\"Paul\\" songs, with the obligatory lone \\"George\\" song per album, to keep their lead guitarist appeased. <br /> <br />One thing, though: Wish they hadn't called it \\"Let It Be...Naked.\\" Sounds like a marketing gimmick. Would have preferred \\"Get Back,\\" to keep it all kosher. <br /> <br />I remember when John and Yoko put out their album \\"Two Virgins\\" (yeah, right) with their naked bodies emblazoned on the cover.  Ouch! Put some clothes on, please!
B00025ETIW|1.0|I found this cd in the library, so I took it home and listend to it. About half of my school or so likes My Chemical Romance, and I like the most of the music that people at my school like, punk rock wise. But I was suprised so many people like this band, the guy can't sing, and the music is not so good. From the songs I listend to I heard no ones that I actually liked and I was very displeased with this album overall. It was a waste of my time listening to it, and I would not ever recomend listening to them. I heard that they're good live, but I don't know for sure myself casue when they came here I was busy at the Senses Fail/ The Bled concert listening to real music.
B00000E2WH|2.0|I have never liked Herbert von Karajan. And, not just because he was one of those Nazis in the musical biz who opted to stay in Hitler's Third Reich.  <br /> <br />True, he was pretty much non-political, but the fact remains that he used the party as a tool towards furthering his musical career;  compare to Arturo Toscanini's stand of courage in refusing to collaborate with the Fascisti in Italy, and openly defying Mussolini's henchmen on Italian soil before expatriating himself to America.  Yes, von Karajan used politics as a vehicle.  Anyone who's ever seen All About Eve knows what this is called: \\"Climbing over corpses on the way to the top.\\"  Tragically, unlike in Anne Baxter's case, the 7 million corpses in von Karajan's rise to stardom weren't figurative. The reason why I truly dislike him because he was probably the second most overblown, over-hyped and overrated conductor of all time (Leonard Bernstein wins first prize hands down). The only lasting legacy for which I'll credit von Karajan was introducing the world to the beautiful violin playing of Anne-Sophie Mutter and the conducting of Mariss Jansons.  <br /> <br />I have heard many of Karajan's recordings, and I just don't understand what all the fuss is about; He tended to beat a mechanical tempo, was more antiseptic than Lysol, and his execution at times downright sloppy. I have only one recording by him that I actually like, and don't wince while listening to (Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic, Columbia Masterworks, ML-4299, mono). He was one of those overemotional conductors, very concerned with his hands fluttering aloft like seagulls, his eyes always closed like he was in some kind of trance or sexual ecstasy (compare this to Toscanini, who communicated to the orchestra his will so directly with those intense, fiery eyes). So, when I read in some alleged arbiter of musical taste, one of those audiophile review magazines, that Karajan was some kind of Sibelius expert, Ijust had to go out and find out what the big deal was.  <br /> <br />With bated breath, I put this CD on the platter. Listening to the opening piece, Finlandia, was like viewing a Rembrandt painting. Painting by-the-numbers, that is.  <br /> <br />Imagine, if you will, a Finlandia without power, dragging along at the speed of the little train that could. Imagine a Swan of Tuonela with all the grace of a half-deflated rubber duck in the bathtub. Envision a Valse Triste which, like its subject, is dead, but has no dreamy afterlife, or a Tapiola, whose tonal portrait of the Finnish forest god Tapio is so drab and lifeless that it could be used as state's evidence to prove Nietzsche's allegation that God is dead (excuse the mixed metaphor).  <br /> <br />So much for Herbert von Karajan's \\"authoritative\\" reading of Sibelius. This small collection has all the inspiration of a Madelyn Murray O'Hair rally.  <br /> <br />To sum up: Skip this one. If you want to hear a top-notch collection of Sibelius' tone poems, try one of the Beecham or Ormandy recordings.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is my favoutite movie of all time. Denzle Washington is a brilliant actor but it showed better than ever in this one.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Somewhere under the skin of \\"Gothika,\\" a slick movie produced by Joel Silver (who must be slipping -- this flick isn't nearly up to the standards of \\"Demolition Man\\" or \\"Predator\\") is a movie with a heart and soul. <br /> <br />I couldn't quite put my finger on it, because the actors' performances are solid across the board, the soundtrack is riveting and the photography is gorgeous. Yet, this movie didn't come off as sincere. It was as though the director (Mathieu Kassovitz) didn't have much faith in the strength of his screenplay, which had a pretty good story. <br /> <br />So, Kassovitz and Silver piled every single computer-generated special effect they could, in order to wow the viewer. But, instead of wowing me, seeing the endless 360-degree tilt-o-whirl pans and ghostly apparitions fading in and out only threw the movie's timing off. It was distracting, and worse, made it easier to predict what was going to happen next, thus taking an above-average script and sacrificing it to CGI animated fluff. <br /> <br />Then, about a week later, I found out why. On television, TBS was broadcasting a movie with a nearly identical plot and theme, even down to the MacGuffins. However, this movie -- \\"What Lies Beneath,\\" directed by Robert Zemeckis in 2000, three years before \\"Gothika\\" -- relied on simple exposition and dialogue and montage more so than special effects to get its story across. I thus understood: \\"Gothika\\" needed a large measure of visual camouflage to shroud the fact that it was a warmed-over remake of a much better movie. <br /> <br />So, go, and see the much better movie. Rent \\"What Lies Beneath\\" tonight. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are excellent in it and Zemeckis has been around long enough to know that the technical wizardry that worked so well in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" would be superfluous to a serious thriller.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne is not the best vocal artist but is a good writer and music artist and that's all that matters. The album however does seem to drag on, songs like Nobody's Fool and Unwanted, while being good in their own way, seem to just sound like fillers in the album, and what i mean by that is that they keep the album over 40 minutes, Avril is one of the first artist that i've seen mess up singing notes and get away with it. I think the best vocal effort on this song for me was I'm With You, the song has so much feeling in it. Sk8er Boi is good, so is songs like Mobile, where it's being honest and innocent. It's fun to listen to, and it's nice to listen an artist who's just having fun.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Before i say anything about the band, i want to say that Rage Against the Machine is one of my favorite bands and Soundgarden is awesome.  That having been said i must say that, although this is a great effort, it just doesnt compare in my mind to Rage or Soundgarden.  The intros sound a lot like Rage intros, owing to the fact that Tom Morello is doing them, and it doesn't seem original enough. When listening to some of the songs, when they start out i can't tell if it's Audioslave or Rage, and then it turns into a question of Audioslave or Soundgarden.  I've given them 3 stars because it's a pretty good album by anybody else, but seeing what the members have done before it doesn't seem as good(and because there's no half star).  All are great musicians but it isn't much a new sound just a combo of the other two bands, not enough new stuff.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I think the only thing that seperates this from the first 2 is the direction, Alfonso Cuaron is a genius, not to take anything away from Chris Columbous who is also a genius of direction, but Alfonso, i think did a better job on working camera shots, the acting is a little overdone in some scenes but it is a great movie. The darker theme does help this movie a lot. Most people said it didn't follow the book well. Well, i did notice that but i don't mind, i just try to forget the book when i'm watching the Harry Potter movies because if i focused on that, i'd be mad about all three of the movies, the Harry Potter movies are just plain fun to watch and Prisoner of Azkaban is no different.
B000062XM7|4.0|Mann has taken some of the characters and incidents from Cooper's novel and woven an entirely new tale from the material. The film is more closely related to today's popular romance paperbacks rather than Cooper's adventure novel. The film is about one young woman's discovery of true love; this is the stuff of romance paperbacks - not adventure novels of the early 19th century. This film is not an adaptation of Cooper's novel but something entirely different.     It is important to note here that Cooper did not create a love life for Hawkeye in any of the five novels he wrote about the frontiersman. The Hawkeye-Cora Munro love story of the film is Mann's fabrication.    The performers, the music, the details of costuming are wonderful - but the film is a far cry from Cooper's novel and historical accuracy. Nonetheless, it's a fun film and recommended for viewing. Just don't take it too seriously. Read the book!    Historical background: 2,000+ persons left Fort William Henry for Fort Edward on the morning of August 10, 1757 when the British surrendered Fort William Henry to the French. The French typically paid their Indian allies with the plunder of the defeated but with the British surrender of the Fort, the Indians were deprived of their \\"pay.\\" The massacre began when Indians began to seize the possesssions of the departing British soldiers and civilians. Those who resisted the plundering were murdered. It was estimated then (and believed so now) that 70-150 persons died in the mayhem. Colonel Munro survived and made his way to Fort Edward with 500 persons. Hundreds more straggled into Fort Edward over the following days. The French risked their lives to stop the massacre and accompanied the survivors to Fort Edward.
0141301155|5.0|I don't even know where to start with this book. It was just fantastic. It is clear that Dahl had such a great imagination, and it's a shame to the world of children's literature that he couldn't live forever. I loved every element of this book. I loved his made-up words like snozzwangers, snozzleberry, hornswogglers, and oompa-loompas. The remarkable descriptions in the book creates pictures in the readers' minds of the factory, the pink walls, the pipes, the rivers of chocolate, the winding corridors, the roller-coaster type elevator and makes the reader feel as if they could be there themselves. While I was reading this book, I felt like I personally watched Agustus Gloop get sucked into the clear pipe. I saw Mike Teavee be sent through television. I was on the elevator when Willy Wonka pushed the \\"Up and Out\\" button to head towards Charlie's house.  <br />Aside from the creativity and the descriptions depicted in this book, I loved how Dahl makes the reader hate all the kids but Charlie, \\"the hero\\". The \\"bad\\" little kids disappeared one by one, and I couldn't help but be happy to read how they slowly disappeared until only little Charlie was left. Charlie and his family were very poor. It was as if Willy Wonka knew that Charlie needed the factory. He wasn't spoiled like Veruca Salt; he would appreciate everything he saw that day in the factory and everything he was given. Charlie and his family were living off of cabbage soup until one day, something miraculous happens: Charlie finds a dollar on the side of the road. With the dollar he buys two candy bars--one which contains the very last Golden Ticket into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Charlie and his Grandpa Joe go on a magnificent adventure throughout the factory. In the end, Mr. Wonka gives Charlie the factory. Charlie and his family never again have to worry about money, food, housing, or anything else. Everything they need is in the factory and they have a happily ever after ending. Dahl did such a great job with this book, and it will probably be on my list of favorites for years. When I become a teacher, I hope to one day encourage my students to read a Roald Dahl book. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the only book I have read by Dahl, but I am certain it won't be that way for long.
0441003257|5.0|This is truly one of the funniest books I have ever had the privilege to have read. I won't bore you with a synopsis . . . that's been pretty well covered by other reviewers by now. What I will add,is that it is the small things that add so much to the book. The 'Wicked Bible' bit, for example. Or how the road to hell is paved with frozen telephone solicitors, and not, in fact,with good intentions. Or who is working in a Burger Lord in Des Moines, Iowa. I could go on and on, but let me put it to you simply . . . Stop reading these reviews, and read the book instead!!!
B000022TSH|5.0|The title of this movie does not refer to the story's setting, at least not until the very end. Rather it is a metaphor for a complex and confusing place that is best left alone lest one ends up getting hurt. It's hard to imagine a better period crime drama than \\"Chinatown\\". In what remains his career-best film (in spite of his recent and amazingly first Oscar win for \\"The Pianist\\"), Roman Polanski made a neo-noir masterpiece in 1974 full of elaborate plot twists, morally ambiguous characters and moody, authentic-feeling atmosphere. This movie is not a tribute to film noir as has been concluded by casual viewers, it's a complete reinvention of that genre into a more complex mindset thanks to Robert Towne's superbly written script.<br /><br />Having just completed the crudely funny \\"The Last Detail\\" and going next to his Oscar-winning \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", Jack Nicholson was on a career-high roll when he played Jake Gittes, a struggling private eye in 1937 Los Angeles. Even in the midst of such an accolade-laden career, this is my favorite of his performances probably because he plays the role so against expectation. Bogart has so clearly etched the world-weary, dame-slapping gumshoe in our collective memories that Nicholson decided to take a less obvious approach here. He plays the detective as a relatively decent guy, who treats his often unsavory job as an honorable profession, even if he has to grub around to serve his clients. In walks Evelyn Mulwray, a mysterious woman with many secrets, who also happens to be the wife of the LA County water commissioner. But is it the real Mrs. Mulwray? What seems like a straightforward adultery case becomes much more as Gittes gets involved with the then-scandalous San Fernando land buying conspiracy, corruption around water politics and of course, murder.<br /><br />In what has to be her career-best performance as well, Faye Dunaway is picture-perfect as Evelyn with her pencil eyebrows, iron-shingled coiffure and cool aura of heightened glamour and deceit. The surprising element to her character is that she looks so right as a femme fatale, and yet she exposes herself as a much more complex person full of emotional scars and trembling self-denial. As her backstory is divulged to both Gittes and the viewer, it becomes clear that her sophisticated veneer has shattered into a desperate scramble to escape her fate and exposes the purest of motives. It's a memorable transformation. In fact, the real core of evil in the story emanates from her father, Noah Cross, a charmer who hides a deeply disturbing soul. Polanski chose director John Huston to play Cross, and it's an inspired choice as he, of course, directed several classics of the same ilk - \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", \\"Key Largo\\", \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\". This in-depth understanding of the genre allows Huston to imbue Cross with the right spirit, enabling him to essay the part perfectly - a thoroughly amoral individual whose apparent good nature can't conceal the stench of corruption that clings to him.<br /><br />The main plotline has Cross and some others planning an elaborate scam to dry up the San Fernando valley by diverting water away from it, then buying up the land cheaply, then re-diverting the water back to the valley, so the property becomes fertile and the price skyrockets. Evelyn's husband has the misfortune to figure out what's going on, and now Jake, following the dead man's trail, comes to the same conclusions. A young girl enters the picture, originally thought to be Cross' mistress, but her identity is far more convoluted. Of course, the disclosure of her identity becomes the point of one of cinema's most unforgettable confrontation scenes between Jake and Evelyn. At the end of the film, Gittes stands by helpless as the woman he has tried to save dies violently despite his best efforts because there are no sure things in the world of \\"Chinatown\\" and certainly no predictable endings. All the period flavor is impeccable from John A. Alonzo's burnished gold-and-brown-hued cinematography to Jerry Goldsmith's moody, insinuating musical score to W. Stewart Campbell's spot-on art direction. A monumental achievement strongly recommended.John A.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|The first time you hear her you make the assumption: this is Billie Holiday in some glorious newly re-mastered recording you have never heard before.  You're a little surprised when you're wrong and more than a little intrigued-this is Madeleine Peyroux.  This fascinating and unique lady has a voice crafted by dedicated training and time as a child spent growing up between France and the United States.  Her first album received high marks from critics, and the sophomore effort \\"Careless Love\\" (Rounder) is anything but a disappointment.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" is pure dreamy magic showcasing this amazing voice, with a light piano riff from Larry Goldings and David Pilch's baseline that make you want to move-an energizing and satisfying new dance piece.  Three great smooth selections that are sure to ignite fans of swing or foxtrot with their intoxicating Creole bluesy flavor are \\"Don't Wait Too long,\\" \\"Lonesome Road,\\" and \\"Careless Love.\\" Slightly more up-tempo pieces like \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" are also imminently satisfying.  Madeleine Peyroux again establishes herself as a French chanteuse on the level of Blossom Dearie with \\"J'ai Deux Amours.\\"<br /><br />Despite the album's title, there is nothing careless in this recording. Producer Larry Klein has outdone himself in assembling a solidly packaged showcase for a voice that is hauntingly familiar and strikingly new all at the same time.  Madeleine Peyroux takes us all the way to the end of love and beyond.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|First off, I must say I'm excited about this DVD release and have ordered it.  Second off, I'm crossing my fingers because I have taped the ENTIRE season of MacGyver off THREE different versions shown on TV (USA, WGN, and TVLand).  All of them are slightly different...slightly edited!  Evidence of this?  Viewers of TVLand will not see a metal pipe burst into flames as Mac uses it to test how hot a door is in \\"Pilot.\\"  Viewers of WGN and USA will not see the final basketball scene of the \\"Pilot.\\"  TVLand version of \\"The Gauntlet\\" shortens the classic Mac & Kate love scene.  WGN cuts out about a minute from the opening gambit of \\"The Gauntlet\\" and also Mac's quip about 'feeling sympathetic for chickens' in \\"The Golden Triangle.\\"  The list goes on...  While these missing bits do not detract from the story of the show, it annoys the hell out of completists like me not to be able to see every episode in its entirety.  Please, Paramount, have the episodes be in their uncut form.  I read somewhere that the runtime is 17 hrs. 25 min. for these 22 episodes.  That boils down to about 47-48 min. per episode, much longer than the 44 min. ones shown on TV (i'm talking about final runtime after commercials are removed).  Still, I heard the original \\"Pilot\\" on ABC was 90 minutes long.  So, I for one, would rather have the episodes all intact rather than some measly extra features, which wouldn't hurt if they put it in.  If this turns out to be the real deal, look for me to buy all 7 seasons.  I haven't had this much fun since I've been \\"in the back seat of a car.\\"  Long live MacGyver!!!
B00000K2W1|5.0|I bought this album months ago and was blown away. I mean literally blown away. I spent hours and hours listening to it. I found Janis' voice so raw and unique that I couldn't put it down. After this album I bought every other Janis Joplin/Big Brother album out there and I just can't get enough of it. There are some great songs missing from this album, but I think that they included the most unique.  <br /> <br />Piece of My Heart - A Erma Franklin cover. It's a great song, and a legendary pop hit.  <br /> <br />Summertime - This is the most memorable song from Janis for me. It's a cover from Porgy & Bess. I'm pretty sure the original artists were Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, but I'm not certain. Either way it's amazing. Janis' voice can't compare to anything else. That's how distinctive it is. <br /> <br />Try (Just a Little Bit Harder) - A great pop/blues song. It's got an Otis Redding feel to it. The screeching at the end sends shivers up my spin.  <br /> <br />Cry Baby - Another hit. I would have replaced it with Little Girl Blue, but it's just an unforgettable as any other song. <br /> <br />Me & Bobby McGee - To be completely honest, I didn't care for it at the beginning. I describe it as a song that grows on you. Once it grows you, it wont let go. Now it's one of my favorite songs of all time. It's another cover, but it's just matches her so well. <br /> <br />Down on Me - A Big Brother classic. It's a cool song that's got a hippy feel to it.  <br /> <br />Get It While You Can - To me, this is one of the most underrated songs of all time. It's just so brilliant but it never gets the credit it deserves. It's bound to change your perspective on life.  <br /> <br />Bye, Bye Baby - Like a lot of other classic hits, it's hard to categorize it.  <br /> <br />Move Over - I believe Janis wrote it. It's a cool, simple song about moving on. Its guitar is infectious.  <br /> <br />Ball N Chain - One of the best songs I've ever heard. Big Mama Thornton wrote it,but Janis and Sam Andrews gave it a special touch and made it an epic. This version doesn't include Sam, which kind of disappoints me. But it's a great live performance.  <br /> <br />Maybe - This is by far my favorite song by Janis. It's got #1 out of every song I've ever heard. This song out souls any R&B singer hands down. The Chantels originally did it and was their only #1 hit. A couple years later Janis releases it on her Kozmic Blues album, and left me speechless. She changed the tune, the words, everything. She transformed it from a cool Do Woop hit, to an amazing blues cry. It's not raspy at all, totally clear. But if you enjoy the rasp (like me) get a copy of her on the Ed Sullivan show.  <br /> <br />Mercedes Benz - A cool goofy song from Pearl. I personally think it's about how some people ask God for things they don't need. Even if I'm wrong, I still love it.  <br /> <br />To sum it up - This is an album from a legendary singer with a legendary set of bands and musicians. It's great spread of songs for just three years. <br />
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Choelho has written us a parable not unlike the tradition of those told by Jesus (albeit much longer).  Then who are the sheep?  What is the treasure?  Isn't it just a 6th grade story about a kid searching for gold and money?  Isn't dreaming of material wealth a shallow and, ultimately, spiritually regressive path?  Jesus said his parables were for those who had ears to hear.  He also said one should not throw pearls before swine.<br /><br />Joseph Raymond
0345409671|5.0|I have not yet finished this book but my neck hurts and my shoulder from not being able to put this book down.  I have never had a book take me away into the other realms and have creation theorized in a different outlook, via Memnoch the former angel.  It reminded me that nobody has questioned the bible as literature and history enough.  Maybe this is a fable from Anne Rice, but it stops to make anyone think that there are many ways of viewing creation, evolution, and what could have happened afterwards to the spiritual war going on when humans keep evolving.  I hope her other novels are as good as this one, I intend to keep reading after finishing the first 4 in the Vampire Chronicles series.  One starts to believe these creatures really do exist.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|this cd is completely worth it.  the band is a good european group and they combine and mold a mix of the Strokes and the Beatles and something wonderful all in one.
B000069CWE|5.0|The remix album is often frowned upon, as most of the time, it's just the same vocals over a new beat which sucks more than the original.  This album, however, is a different story. <br /> <br />Like many aspects of their music, Linkin Park went all-out on this 'reanimated' album, breaking down familiar hits and not-so-familiar ones into a different animal.  Reanimation truely shows the creative side of the band and their tastes in music. <br /> <br />From orchestrated performances to rock song turned hip-hop, it's all here.  Ever wanted to hear In The End turned into a hip-hop song?  Done.  A redone beat, new lyrics, and collaboration with Motion Man make this mosh song into a hip-hop head nodder.  The fast-paced Forgotten gets an interesting twist as everything has slowed down into a less-rash rap song, with a guest appearance from Chali 2na, of Jurassic 5 fame. <br /> <br />But for those who enjoyed LP's rock side, there's no lack of that either.  The reanimated Pushing Me Away is a classic song that is even better than the original.  The new chorus along with new vocals from Stephen Richards makes this possibly the best remix on the album.  However, the last 3 tracks of the album take the cake. <br /> <br />In Hybrid Theory, the song 'Cure For The Itch' was a strange affair, from the very beginning sounding like a showcase of scatching skills and a very laid back beat.  The treated version of it is possibly the most changed of the lot; something you might possibly hear in a club.  Unlike the first, the reanimated version is danceable/break-able. <br /> <br />One Step Closer and Crawling, two of the most successful songs on LP's debut, have been broken down into two emotional pieces.  One Step Closer gets an urban/jungle feel to it, with a new atmospheric intro that sets a whole new tone to the piece.  Crawling gets a string orchestra put to it, creating an emotional and climactic end to an already great album.  Both tracks blow the rest out of the water in length; both come in at over 5:30 each. <br /> <br />As a whole, Reanimation is not just a remix album.  It's a look into the creative minds and outlet of a band once thought to be one of the most \\"corporate\\" bands in existence, and prove that, like their debut album title suggests, Linkin Park is truely a hybrid of a different sort.
6301640659|3.0|I snuck into the theater when I was 13 years old to see this and was disturbed to say the least - as a young gay teen, Friedkin's own brand of \\"horrorshow\\" made me (wrongly) assume that all gay men were leather-clad, freaky serial killers! Still, when you look at the f*d-up film now, you see many of the same techniques the director used for his earlier hits like \\"Exorcist,\\" most notably shock tactics and in-your-face blunt sexually violent imagery to get a reaction out of conservative critics and audiences alike. In fact, in retrospect, I'd say all the negative press coverage and gay rights protests that met \\"Cruising\\" upon its initial 1982 theatrical release were a bit overkill - sure this movie decidedly portrays (some) gays in a negative, one-note light, but this isn't a documentary (even if it feels like one), but a fictional murder-mystery thriller with a gay angle as thematic hook.  Oddly, I actually wish Friedkin would have gone further - funny, he doesn't shy away from showing seedy, explicit, severely cruel gay murders (*the scene where the killer knifes the cute Columbia professor in the back saying \\"You made me do that!\\" ranks as one of the most disturbing death scenes ever!), Friedkin doesn't have the BALLS to show male-on-male affection - this explains why Pacino in the lead role seems so UNCOMFORTABLE at doing his P.I. work - he's willing to go underground, but he's NOT willing to GO DOWN!  And what are we to make of the notoriously \\"ambivalent\\" final shot - to me, it feels more like a COP-OUT than a genuine mystery - is Pacino's cop gay? the killer? in denial? Is it all a dream? Who knows - the film itself looks like it was SEVERELY EDITED prior to release - so here's hoping when and IF it ever re-surfaces on DVD we will be treated to DELETED SCENES which censors cut out that might finally explain it all?  Or at least an indepth documentary illuminating the process behind the camera?  As it is, CRUISING remains a flawed, but undeniable ground-breaking, ahead-of-its-time movie - do you think a major studio movie covering gay sexuality would ever be THIS unflinching in its depicting or honesty of some segements of extreme gay sex culture? Hell NO! At times, it looks like a bleak, sad glimpse at another world - and it was to my eyes: a decadent 70s idyll in NYC that we've all heard about, but now post-AIDS seems like centuries ago, the Roman era if you will.  At least we have this sordid little flick as a kind of document of that long lost Mappelthorpe-esque era.  **FINAL NOTE: During the graphic gay murder scenes, if you look VERY close, you can tell that Friedkin has INSERTED SUBLIMINAL XXX GAY PORNO SCENES in the midst of the violence, equating gay intercourse with the act of murder?  Aside from the fact I am AMAZED this got past the censors in the 80s, this kind of directorial decision is very very upsetting to say the least - what is Friedkin trying to say in these sequences - or just get us all collectively off with homophobic violence?  Not everyone's cup of tea, but you'll have to rent the film to decide.
B000089RVX|4.0|I don't listen to a lot of music, but I bought this album the day it came out.  Evanescence does a tremendous job of mixing beautiful and aggressive vocals with a strong rock background.  The songs have imagination and don't just resmeble the last ex-relationship song you heard on the radio.  I don't usually sing in the car, but I'll roll up the windows for this one!!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|As an avid listener of music, I was astonished by how great The Diary of Alicia Keys was.  Alicia not only topped her first album, Songs in A Minor, but she proved herself as a true artist.   <br /> <br />I must admit, I was not a real Alicia Keys fan when she first became known, but this CD has definitely changed my views.  When public reviews were comparing her to such defined artists as Stevie Wonder, I thought they were insane.  I have been proven wrong.  Her style, music, and grace are all in a category of their own. <br /> <br />The soul she put into each and every track made it more than easy to listen through the whole CD without skipping any tracks.  The catchy beat she rocks throughout the album puts the listener in a trance and makes it possible to step outside of the real world and just flow with the beat.  She definitely took a different approach from her first, smooth, mellow sounding album and moved to a classier, original soul, jazzy sound.  Alicia has broken down all barriers and taken her abilities to the next level.  Without holding back any of the talent her first album lacked, she was able to produce a masterpiece.   <br /> <br />I personally am a true fan of the second title off her new album, \\"Karma.\\"  Alicia was able to take the clich phrase \\"what goes up must come down,\\" and turn it into a beat defying, vocally jazzy hit.  It is only one of the many songs on her album that can truly make your head bob.  Another song I found to be extremely entertaining is the cover song \\"If I Was Your Women,\\" originally by Gladys Knight.  She once again developed sweet instrumentals for this song and turned it into an even bigger hit than it already was. <br /> <br />This CD is a must have.  Do not create a burned copy of this CD, but go out to stores and buy a real copy, because this is one album worth going out to buy.  She proves herself worthy of not only becoming famous, but infamous.  There is no doubt in my mind that she will be the next legend of musical history. <br />
B000002KAT|5.0|Alright, let's get this out of the way first: multitudes of undeserving albums receive five-star reviews here on Amazon.com. What Van has done here, however, defies description, stands tall as perhaps the finest work in pop music history, and deserves oh so much more than five stars. If you enjoy \\"Moondance\\" or \\"Greatest Hits,\\" give this a try - you may find that it rapidly becomes ALL you listen to!<br /><br />1. \\"Astral Weeks:\\" 100/100 - A brilliant opener.<br /><br />2. \\"Beside You:\\" 85/100<br /><br />3. \\"Sweet Thing:\\" 87.5/100 - The only \\"Astral Weeks\\" track to make it into Van's inferior \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, this tune provides a more accessible sampling of the greatness contained within the rest of the album.<br /><br />4. \\"Cyprus Avenue:\\" 150/100 - Unreal!! Van sings powerfully about unrequited love while a harpsichord jangles loosely along<br />in the background.<br /><br />5. \\"Way Young Lovers Do:\\" 72.5/100 - A jazzy number featuring a nice trombone solo that provides an interesting change of pace. A good song, but one that pales in comparison to the rest of the material.<br /><br />6. \\"Madame George:\\" 200/100 - The single greatest piece of pop music ever written. Peerless in its lyrical and musical beauty.<br /><br />7. \\"Ballerina:\\" 110/100 - Another exceptional track.<br /><br />8. \\"Slim Slow Slider: 75/100 - A subdued closer that quietly drifts away.<br /><br />This is more than an album - it's a microcosm of all the gut-wrenching, tear-welling, bitter-sweet emotions that we all feel. Popular music will never again so perfectly capture the essence of love, anger, heartbreak, nostalgia, uncertainty and change that defines the human condition. Van and company didn't just make an album, they took the setting sun behind the house you grew up in, the touch of that special someone's hand, the stinging sweetness of the memory of a lost loved one, and the surreality of a long overdue homecoming and compressed it all into one 50 minute masterpiece.
B000020617|5.0|There Is Nothing Left To Lose is, put simply, a solid album.  Spanning hard rock, alternative, and a bit of folk, this album pulls together each into a cohesive, upbeat effort.  Most of the songs are fairly simple and straight-forward, making TINLTL the most accessible Foo Fighters album, and a good starting place for any new fans.  Also, the music videos that accompany the album instill Dave Grohl's signature humor, and are worth a watch. 'Learn To Fly,' 'Next Year,' and 'Breakout,' comprise the album's singles.   <br /> <br />To naysayers - 'Learn To Fly' is Dave Grohl's least favorite song on the album.  And yes, he was in Nirvana - but he isn't anymore, and hasn't been for over a decade. <br />
B00005V9HH|5.0|The film centers around five different criminals in New York that are locked up together, based on a trumped up weapons charge. After their release, they decide to work together and get revenge, by commiting crimes. However, someone else is controlling the events that take place. The five men soon discover that they are connected to each other because they have all pulled jobs where they unknowingly ripped off a man going by the alias of Keiser Sose. The mysterious Keiser Sose is basically thought of as the Devil himself in the criminal underworld. The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose. <br />  <br />Bryan Singer's \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. If I had to create a list of my five favorite films, it would definately be on that list. When it comes to most mystery films, I can only usually watch them once. Once I know how the film will end, I can never make myself sit through them again because the suprise of what comes next is gone. The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end. In fact, the film only seems to get better after each time that I see it. The film unfolds brilliantly. It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U.S. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time. The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film, is how director Bryan Singer handles the character of Keiser Sose. The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing. You come to believe throughout the course of the movie, that Sose could literally be the Devil himself. <br /> <br />Another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen. The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors. Gabriel Byrne stars as Dan Keaton who is the leader of the group. Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality. On one hand, Keaton is chosen as the leader because of how cold, calculating, and evil he is overall. But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times. Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly. This film also marks the breakout role for actor Kevin Spacey with his portrayal of a crippled con artist named Verbal Kint. Spacey had to do the most work in the film without a doubt because he not only had to perform scenes in the events that unfold, but Verbal Kint is also the man that is forced to sit through the interigation where we learn about the events that unfold and how they went down. Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple. He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal. He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature. The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack. <br /> <br />This highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours. Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece. The DVD is worth the money alone just for the extras. Some of them include never before seen deleted scenes, audio commentaries by director Bryan Singer & writer Christopher McQuarrie, three featurettes, a gag reel , and much more.<br /> <br />A solid 5/5... <br /> <br />
0385513755|1.0|The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating book, but the illustrated edition is a bit of a travesty.

B000067J1H|5.0|Edward Norton who is billed as the narrator of the story, plays a man who suffers from chronic insomnia that has caused him to become obsessed with finding and buying all the objects that complete him as a person. In an effort to break free, he soon becomes a frequent visitor to self help groups. He begins to discover that hearing other people's problems make his pale in comparison which finally produces a cure for his insomnia. He also meets a slippery soap salesman named Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt). The two soon become friends and develop the concept of underground fight clubs. All different types of men are allowed to take out their frustrations on the world by fighting each other. Tyler soon becomes obsessed with using the fight clubs as an outlet to rewrite the rules of society by assigning memebers of the clubs tasks to be completed before each session that consist of committing random acts of vandalism and violence. Things soon start to spin out of control however, when the phenomenon of the fight club spreads to other cities all acorss America and more and more men are willing to do whatever it takes to have their next fight.     Fight Club is one of the best films ever made in my opinion, and if I had make a list consisting of my five favorite films, Fight Club would definately be on it. The film provides an interesting premise taken from the novel of the same name written by Chuck Palanhiuk, as well as constant laughs, hard hitting action, and incredible performances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Both Norton and Pitt have great on screen chemistry together and appear as if they could be friends in real life. The fight scenes in this movie are extremely well choreographed and come off looking very realistic. They offer a savage and raw style of fighting that makes most fight scenes you will see pale in comparison. Perhaps my favorite aspect of Fight Club, is the story behind the film taken from Chuck Palanhiuk's novel. The issues of the story take an honest and humorous look at consumerism and the way that society is obsessed with defining themselves based on what they own. The film stresses that after awhile the things you own, end up owning you, and this is what leads Tyler on his mission to show that you are only free to do anything, once you have lost everything.     Overall, the acting, interesting and humorous premise, and fantastic fight scenes all come together to create a fantastic film. Fight Club is one of the few movies that I actually consider a must own for anyone's DVD collection.     A solid 5/5...
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is a love story about two people meant for each other, an honest to goodness written in the stars kind of love, but who are thwarted by modern life. It's a simple, sad story told with a refreshingly unique and seamless style. <br /> <br />It's really an amazing, different movie. I was impressed, I mean it's basically an 80 minute conversation, but you get so engrossed in it you don't notice. It moves so fluidly and naturally it's literally like reconnecting with old friends and spending a few hours with them. Achieving this, the filmmakers don't need anything else but words and actors to bring them to life. A little aside, I love how they'll use the long takes but then cut briefly to a closeup or another shot to keep any unnecessary tension away from the experience. <br /> <br />The acting is completely natural, often disarmingly and remarkably so, there is nothing to suggest that they are acting as they are so lifelike and realistic. These characters are incredibly real and deep and hurt, but it's not heavy-handed or overt in any aspect. The presence of a fate and destiny thwarted haunts us and them. Julie Delpy is delightful, but I think it is Ethan Hawke who is really transcendent in this. I loved his performance immensely.  <br /> <br />This is a bittersweet nearly heartbreaking film, but not really that depressing as it's not in the least heavy or dark. It's just beautifully done all around and is often a heck of a lot of fun to watch. And Paris has never looked better.  <br /> <br />I'd highly recommend it (and I hope it gets a Best Original Screenplay nomination).
B000000OUE|5.0|Anyone in the 19-24 age group will definitely remember a time when you couldn't walk down the Middle School/High school without at least seeing someone wearing an Asto Creep 2000 t-shirt with one of Rob Zombie's twisted artwork on it...It almost brings a tear to my eye remembering the days of memories past. <br /> <br />White Zombie had everything going for them. They were a band that pretty much threw the whole Horror Movie/50's Dragster magazine/tattoo-parlor-come-to-life image in everyone's face, and guess what? Everyone loved it! \\"More Human than Human\\" did not help drive \\"Astro Creep:2000\\" to double platinum status (I'm pretty sure it's gone at least triple since then) all on its own. White Zombie was just a kooky camp of kids that lived for cheap thrills, horror movies(you're going to hear a lot of this in the review), and whatnots. Their music was a genius combo of Sludge Metal, Doom, some semi-Thrash influences with a flavor of Disco's up-beat Pop sensibilities. Add into the factor of the most brilliant(and sometimes heavy) usage of Sci-Fi and Horror movie audio samples and you definitely have a new Frankenstein-like monster brings a new definition to the saying 'WHAM! BAM! Thank-you mam!' <br /> <br /> Rob Zombie was at the top of his game as far as writing lyrics and arranging the music to fit his voice(he lost this with his sub-par solo material, which disappointed me as a long-time WZ fan). He knows his limits and doesn't see the usage to over-step those boundaries. Next to Rob's genius is bassist Sean Yseult. Any male fan of White Zombie knows how much of a mythical goddess Sean Yseult, golden curly locks and all, was in our early days of puberty, but none the less a rather excellent bassist and laying down a thick wall of extra 'crunch' to WZ's sound. Drummer John Tempesta(of ex-Testament fame for us Metal heads) and guitarist Jay Noel Yuenger also in turn throw in their bit of the help in helping \\"Astro Creep:2000\\" become one helluva album. Must I notforget the Horror/Sci-Fi movie samples? If I did I would be missing-out on a huge part of \\"AC2K\\". The samples were just brilliant in giving is that fun edges to it, in that you can easily take this as a good party album and nobody would notice the difference. <br /> <br /> \\"Astro Creep:2000\\"'s track list is like a Halloween mixed bag of treats for us. Few of them the average music fan knows, or has heard on the radio, the instant classic that is adored by everyone. Some are our personal favorites, and then there are the couples that stick-out but later grow on us over time. <br /> <br /> 1. Electric Head Prt.1 (The Agony) - Starts out with a warped old movie sample, going into some reverse organ piano playing and then some doomy-sounds before hitting that main sludge-like verse riff that just gets you into the head banging spirit. <br /> <br /> 2. Super-Charger Heaven - OH YES! This is definitely a Hot Rod racing anthem. I can just imagine racing a rust-covered, Army olive green 69' GTO with 450 HP engine, pumping-out green flames from the exhaust. Definitely faster in the sense of adding a dash of 50's Rockabilly tones to it. The little Latin rite of excommunication-sample before the last verse is a little tweak that will have you screaming \\"Devil Man running in my head!\\" all day long.   <br /> <br /> 3. Real Solution #9 - \\"And I remember her saying I'm already dead!\\" Ooooooo! How creepy! Definitely laying-down the mood for this track in a slowed down mid-tempo song. It's almost on automatic and the lyric \\"Who will survive and what will be left of them?\\" taken from the infamous Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie poster. <br /> <br /> 4. Creature of the Wheel - Ugh! Sludge, and more sludge! More or less a continuation of \\"Real Solution #9\\" but even ten times more heavily. Adding even more weirdness is another scary Hellfire & Brimstone preaching sample that has 'And oh brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him.' There's also some weird orchestration noise in the background, but that may be due to guitar feedback.  <br />  <br /> 5. Electric Head Pt. 2 (The Ecstasy) - \\"I just said 'Up yours baby\\". With an intro like that, it brings up into the stomp-heavy riff fest of the second part of the 'Electric Head' duo. Not as fast as the first, but still does the job in making one want to head bang. <br />  <br /> 6. Grease Paint And Monkey Brains - Oh man. I don't care what was creepier before this song, but that twisted Circus carnival noise just does it for me. Nothing is as scary sounding as Carnival noise. This one is a snoozer with Rob's whispering <br /> <br /> 7. I Zombie - Starts off with a church choir quickly turned into horrifying female screaming then BAM! Downward-spiraling chainsaw guitars and Rob's voice even more downward descending. A great wake-up after the snooze-fest of 'Grease Paint and Monkey Brains' <br /> <br /> 8. More Human Than Human - As I said previously \\"Astro Creep:2000\\" did not exactly go double-platinum on its own. The infamous MTV Buzz Clip(god I'm really showing my age now) helped make this song probably the most recognizable singles from the 90's, amidst the rest of the mainstream crud (remember, this was released a year after Kurt Cobain bit the bullet) that was going on. A funky-little bass line by Sean Yseult, some techno influence and Rob's rap-like Disco edge made this song a fun anthem for the Replicants from the movie 'Blade Runner'(Watch the movie and you'll find out what I mean)...A lot better than most of the  <br /> <br /> 9. El Phantasmo & the Chicken-Run Blast-O-Rama - What a killer song title! I must admit whenever I bought my first copy back in '95, I just remember looking at that particular song title and thinking \\"Now that's the key to selling albums...great songs titles\\". This song while having a good riff at the beginning quickly turns into one of the more groove-style down tuning (probably a drop-C)...the song continues with really creepy Horror Movie samples that sound like they came from the 'Night of The Living Dead' or a really obscure 70's Grind house flick. <br /> <br />10. Blur the Technicolor - Oh yes! Definitely my favorite. The intro has some interesting tribal samples(could have easily came from 'Cannibal Holocaust'...Rob has expressed quite a love that that movie). The groove riffs really exceed where they sounded limited in the previous song, plus with a more warped sound to them and not to forget Rob's excellent showcase of quasi-hard rhyming. <br /> <br />11. Blood Milk and Sky - Back into the sludge we are! Starts off with an Indian chant played backwards, this song is given a dream-like atmosphere. Rob just gargles, mutters, and deeply moans the lyrics...really brooding and drone-like. There are some really nice female sing-along vocals during the chorus that just make it even more mysterious. <br /> <br /> And there you have it. For those who missed out on it whenever it was first released...shame on you. Shame, shame, FOR SHAME on you poor pitiful souls. You have not lived, until you have experienced 'Astro Creep:2000'. By far one of the most entertaining and original Mainstream Metal albums of the 90's. This album deserves to be in every music collection. <br />
B00008J4P5|5.0|I would have to agree with the critics.  Since my first listen, I can't take it out of my cd player.  I'm still a big Zeppelin, Stones, Pearl Jam fan but the White Stripes are now right up there.
B00005JMXX|1.0|1.  An ice-age can take place in 16 days.<br /><br />2.  An artic hurricane can freeze helicopter fuel instantly but has no effect on normal household gas.<br /><br />3.  An experienced explorer can walk from Philadelphia to NYC in one day in the worst blizzard in history.<br /><br />4.  The President of the US will stay in the White House until the very end to \\"stay with the sinking ship\\".<br /><br />5.  Books being burnt look remarkably like wood being burnt and apparently last a long time.<br /><br />6.  In a massive flood in NYC, unmanned oil tankers will be able to circumnavigate the flooded streets to arrive at the door of the public library.<br /><br />I'm sure there was a lot more I could have learned, but I was laughing too hard.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Great show. Can't wait until \\"P.U.L.S.E.\\" comes out on DVD (especially so I stop wearing out VHS versions!), but this is a good show in the meantime. Some interesting material not seen elsewhere. Good stuff.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite CD's.  The man can sing.
B000001F60|5.0|Here is the single BEST intro to the Moody Blues that any non-fan could ever pick up. It is more solid and less expansive than any of the so-called 'Core 7'(ie: Days Of Future Passed, Lost Chord, Threshold, Children's Children, EGBDF, Question, and Sojourn). This album is simply an 8-song set of stand-alone tunes that won't confuse the listener who may or may not be accustomed to the Blues' style of organic album-writing which has been tagged with the title &quot;rock symphonies&quot;.<br />&quot;Lost World&quot; is a straight-ahead, middle-of-the-road groove rocker, while &quot;Isn't Life Strange?&quot; sounds like something that KISS might have covered(believe it or not...just listen to &quot;Great Expectations&quot; on 'Destroyer'), and &quot;Singer In A Rock &amp; Roll Band&quot; is the closest that the Blues ever came to 70's funk(ironically enough, considering its title) and is one of the greatest &quot;goodbye kisses&quot; that a band ever gave to its audience(right behind the Beatles' Abbey Road medley with &quot;The End&quot; and Cream's farewell concert).<br />In all, recommend this to someone who doesn't have a Moody Blues collection and tell them to start their &quot;7 Shades Of Blue&quot; here, in reference to the &quot;Core 7&quot; albums at the heart of the Moody Blues collection.
B000002J1U|5.0|WOW. I love how this group has a different style in each of there cd's. This one is almost all acoustic except for Immigrant Song which is awesome song played by Jimmy Page on the electric guitar. I think this is probably one of the best overall acoustic cd's I or anybody else has ever heard so far. The song Friends I believe was redone by System of a Down for there song Aerials because they sound almost identical. Celebration Day, Tangerine, Out On the Tiles, and Gallows Pole are cool songs with awesome acoustic guitar playing by Jimmy Page and great lyrics by Robert Plant, but my favorite song off this album and one of my top 5 Led Zeppelin songs is Bron-Y-Aur-Stomp which is a addicting acoustic guitar song played very fast and is a great one to listen to over and over again. Also that John Bonham still keeps his usual fast awesome drumming in almost every song. Although don't expect to hear John Paul Jones's bass guitar in a lot of the songs because this album being mostly acoustic. <br /> <br />SONG RATINGS: <br />1. Immigrant Song- (2:23)-10/10  <br />2. Friends- (3:54)-10/10  <br />3. Celebration Day- (3:28)-9/10  <br />4. Since I've Been Loving You- (7:24)-9/10  <br />5. Out On the Tiles- (4:05)-10/10  <br />6. Gallows Pole- (4:56)-10/10  <br />7. Tangerine- (3:10)-10/10  <br />8. That's the Way- (5:37)-10/10  <br />9. Bron-Y-Aur-Stomp- (4:16)-10/10  <br />10. Hat's Off to (Roy) Harper- (3:42)-10/10
0446530891|2.0|Okay, I'm a sucker for most of his stuff, but this one fails spectacularly in the last section. <br /> <br />The plot borrows extensively from screenwriter Jeff Maguire's \\"In The Line Of Fire\\".. an aging secret service agent has to deal with the long-term repercussions of failing and having his charge, a candidate for President, assasinated.  Fast forward some years, and wouldn't you know it, here's an attractive young female Secret Service agent, and the same thing happens to her! <br /> <br />So after three hundred pages of them sharing leads and partnering fully on their shared mysteries, Baldacci starts cheating.  The main character, formerly quite vocal about his ideas, insights and discoveries, starts playing it cagey and not sharing.  The identities of key players are occluded. And extremely unlikely scene for the big showdown is chosen.  <br /> <br />And Baldacci's dark-horse villain, once he's got the protagonist on the ropes, can't shut up talks and talks for pages, wrapping up every tiny little red herring... beyond caricature. <br /> <br />An ultimately losing effort.  I felt cheated.. it's like Baldacci ran out of steam and simply tossed off an ending.
B00004LN16|5.0|This is where AC/DC started, man. All drive-hard blues riffs tangled up in hard-end rock n roll. Throughout the 80's, they got more into the \\"heavy metal\\" phase all bands were going through. Stiff Upper Lip is a great blues album from a great blues-rock band. I suggest you buy it as soon as possible. After all, you wouldn't want to miss out would you?
B00004R99F|5.0|This is a great movie!  I'm 19 and I've watched it over a dozen times.  My parents got me the VHS when I was in sixth grade, I lost it and now bought the DVD.  It has a fun feel to it, full of good humor for adults and kids, and a wonderful father-son story that makes me laugh and cry.  Though not quite as epic as other Disney movies, this one is my personal favorite.  I love the music as well, you can tell they put a lot of hard work into making this film and it paid off.  Five stars.  Spectacular.
B00005JM20|5.0|Just to see Rowan A's facial expressions change from a bumbling insincere 'oaf' to the smooth and deboniare 'James Bond' Johnny English is to appreciate a master at work. It certainly is an art ......  <br /> <br /> <br />Not since Peter Sellers' Pink Panther days has anyone been able to take his place and really make the audience outright laugh rather than just groan at cheap Saturday Night Live type dumb dumb humour ...  <br /> <br /> <br />Loved this movie and it's worth every penny ....
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I dunno, I found the whole zion war a bit too boring at times with the exception to those great setinal scenes. Everything in the movie can get so boring after watching it a couple of times, with absolute exception to the Neo VS. Smith final showdown!  <br /> <br />The thing that really makes me love this movie is the best fight scene between two men I've ever seen! EVER! I mean its truly awesome. The best part has to be when Agent Smith and Neo flew into each other at such terrific speed and caused that flash of white light and the exploded shattered glass from both buildings to add to the coolness of fighting in mid-air in a raging storm between two building while flying upwards toward the sky! Very god-like powers, absolutely cool. <br /> <br />So thats why I love this film. BEST FIGHT EVER!
B00005UW9T|5.0|My best friend lent me this movie a year back and swore to me that I would love it as much as she did.  I was a little hesistant at first, but indeed this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.  The mix of traditional animation mixed with computer-generated animation is superb and done extremely well.  The acting and voice talents were well cast and the voices truly embody the characters that they play.  However, the best part is the music.  Although there are only a few, they are all done extremely well and are creative, cute, as well a being catchy.  I often have found myself absent-mindedly humming \\"Journey to the Past\\" or \\"Once Upon a December\\".  The song that is done over the credits (I believe it is called \\"Life is a Road\\") is also one of the best theme songs written for a movie, in my opinion.  Sure, the story is riddled with historical inaccuracies, but its bound to happen.  Most stories are distorted somewhat when translated to the big screen.  However, the story presented is done well.  This is a not-to-be-missed movie!!  Enjoy!!
B00000373U|4.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i dont up in the same category either. <br /> <br />Elliott Smith once a member of Heatmiser and now a solo artist sounds like a five year after he has been severely beat. meek, shy, and forgiving even his anger is subtle. It is funny how suicide adds the ultimate credibility to your work, and that is exactly what it has done to his. Listening to him might sound boring at first but after a couple of listens im usually emotionally on edge. I was watching Good Will Hunting when some of these moving songs came on, \\"Between the Bars\\", \\"Say Yes\\", and \\"Angeles\\" were all on Either/ Or. So i bought it. Those songs are easily digestible with the right amount of hook but a lot of the other songs need a little time to truly understand the fierce nature of his sadness. The guitar work is simple but truly romantic and blossoming. Guitar almost overshadows the voice which i have described earlier. after about 5 listens \\"Speed Trials\\" really gets to me and then \\"No Name. 5 follows\\". If you purchase this CD then be patient, all of the songs will fall into place because it truly is a great CD and you will be deeply moved. But to be moved you have to be in a certain mindset. <br />
0064407667|2.0|As a fan of the likes of Invader Zim and Edward Gorey, I thought I should give this series a try.  However, the books are written at such a low reading level that I could not recommend them to anyone out of middle school.  The author has an annoying habit of explaining every little term that I'm already familiar with (I hate it when authors question my intelligence).  I finished reading the book because it was quite short, and I was somewhat amused at the outrageous schemes of Count Olaf and his crew.  However, in reality, if the kids would have just called the police, the authorities would have gone beserk and intervened in America anyway.  The book lacks any subtlety or complexity.  Not recommended.
0553208845|5.0|Why are we are?. What is happiness?. What's love? These classical philosophical questions are addressed in this novel that leaves you thinking.<br /><br />The story takes place in India, where a man, Siddhartha, tries to experience everything during his life in order to be able to answer these vital questions.<br /><br />This book deserves to be read more than once so you can grasp the deep thoughts that Herman Hesse tries to transmit.
B0006399FS|1.0|I am 32 years old and have followed U2 since the first time I saw the video for Gloria many years ago.  The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby basically form the soundtrack to my life.  U2 is truly the most important band to me.  Having said that...How to Dismantle is by far the most lame effort they have made.  I seriously want my money back.  This is horrible.  I can't believe they are trying to pass this off as any kind of credible effort.  I thought that 'All that you can't leave behind' was a very commendable and relevant recording.  It showed that they were still a band worth following.  Well if their latest recording is the best they have to offer then they need to retire.  It's like an all-star athlete who just can't quit so they end their career with several years of mediocrity.  'One Step Closer' is a good tune!  That's it!!
B0002Y69NQ|4.0|I'm not a real big fan of the Matrix trilogy, but I will be the first to say, this is one impressive set!  NOTE TO GEORGE LUCAS: <br />This is the kind of set we were expecting for the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy.  What the hell happened?  This set is a tribute to the trilogy.  A complete study of the movies, warts and all.  The action figure is a nice touch as the presentation.  If you are a \\"Matrix\\" fan, sell your original sets, buy this one!  Even if you have to save and save, or even put it in layaway.  Perhaps Santa will bring it to you, yeah, Santa.  What a great Christmas present it would be for that hard to please movie fan on your list.

B00005JN0T|4.0|The producers of this film were so intent on getting Will Smith to star that they changed the story and 'invented' his character.  In the book Det. Spooner didn't exist.  However, in a world that can 'reinvent' remakes, why not a classic book?  That note aside the movie itself is pretty good.  Loads of action and spectacular special effects dominate this film.  It really moves at a fast clip with confident direction and solid performances by all.  It really is a lot of fun to watch, with that \\"Independence Day\\" popcorn feel.  A great way to spend an evening, or rainy day.

B000063JZQ|4.0|This is a serious attempt to Macbeth's story. In spite of being a Playboy production and some perhaps unnecessary nudes, the tragedy is faithfully told. Shakespeare love for violence and the supernatural is well known and this film makes justice, I believe, to the playwright's intentions. In his stage he could not show much of the actual violence such as is depicted in the movie, but this was more because of the limitations of the time, rather than because the audience did not love blood. Remember that public executions were commonplace in Shakespeare's England. <br /> <br />One of the best aspects of the film is the geography, the atmosphere, the gray and hostile texture. Tragedy is implicit in the rainy weather, the bleak stones, the barren fields. <br /> <br />An aesthetic experience not to be missed.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The joy of Harry winning the Quidditch final for Gryffindor was left out of this film a most important connection and the main reason for the spell to overcome the Dementors, so Harry could play Quidditch without falling off his broom again...and where was the Firebolt broom he used in that final that was taken from him for inspection, by Prof. McGonagall after receiving it anonymously as a Xmas present..that finaly turned out to be from Sirius... I was disappointed over that. The Firebolt thus appeared in the last scene squashed into the films last minute with a note from Sirius. The invisibility cloak's usage was also different than the book. Hermione's odd behaviour was hardly noticable and if I didn't read the book I wouldn't have known what the plot was. The scenery was an improvement I have that same picture of a Loch in Scotland the part were the Dementors killed the orchid blossoms as they sailed past.     The special effects where much keener I enjoyed that,and The Marauders Map, and end credits etc. I missed Richard Harris though as Dumbledore, his replacement didn't do anything for me.     Keeping true to the book will work much better. The links were not tied together well. Hermione's hair was nondiscript...The choir was a good added bonus though. Harry looked ok in his casuals and they did wear their uniforms as well...Daniel Radcliffe is a cute lad and fits the character perfectly. The stages from age 10 to fourteen springs the story from a kids film to a teens film as the books do...This is correct natural progress.     I love owls and I commend JK Rowling on her portrayal of these magnificant birds. Dawn French was superb as the fat lady and Snape is a horror as usual, he gets worse in each book..Pam Ferris' short part as the formidable aunt who blew up was superb comedy...and Harry being rebellious at last against the Dursleys was much more human of him,(pity they removed the memory they deserve to remember that).     The Knight bus had me in stitches..and the conducter looked oddly like Jack from the British comedy sitcom, On The Buses. The Hippogryph flight was lovely and the Dementors were just as scary as the book...yeeeuuuck!! The black dog was scary too I always get the jitters over black dogs as I was attacked by one as such..glad it turned out to be friendly. I liked the portrayal of the time slip stuff saving Sirius and the Hypogriff. I loved the spell as the stag over the lake, the were-wolf, the whomping willow was terrific effects, spinning the kids round like that.     The Goblet of Fire, book 4 will be a challenge ..The Quidditch world cup was a bit far fetched I thought though with all the daft characters....I have just got through reading that at the moment....quite a dark one a bit gorey too.    This DVD is good...but it could have been so much better with a little extra thought.I do like the special features especially Hogmeads and The Knight Bus also the interviews with the young cast.
B000002LKU|5.0|The first and last tracks of this disc are wonderful, and there is plenty of good stuff in between.  Mr. Knoppfler demonstrates throughout that it is not the quantity of notes put forth in a given space of time but rather their quality and relevance that make the artist.  I have the feeling when I listen to either \\"Railroad Worksong\\" or \\"Feel Like Going Home\\" that I just don't want this particular song to end.  If you've heard the track \\"On Every Street\\" from Dire Straits' final disc of the same name, perhaps you feel the same way.
B00006GFAB|5.0|This album is great, not the best, but none the less a KISS album. This albums tells the best from one of the hottest band ever: KISS. I think this album didn't have enough songs from KISS, for example: Nothin'To Lose, Mainline, Let Me Go Rock 'n Roll, Let Me know, Radioactive, Great Expectations, Flaming Youth, Nothing Can Keep Me From You, Rip It Out, Ozone, Two Sides Of The Coin and TONS MORE! <br /> <br />This album contains only the very best of KISS, no new songs or interviwes. But if you want to know what was the best of KISS's songs, buy this album and belive me: IT IS THE VERY, VERY BEST FROM THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD, KISS!!!!!!!
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a novel about a Utopian city. Everyone in this city is perfect. If they are not perfect, there are serious consequences. When you are 12, you are given a job. When you request it, you can apply for children. You don't choose your spouse, your children, or your job. The irony of this book is that the so-caled \\"perfect city\\" is really not perfect at all. I didn't exactly like some of the ideas in this book, but it did make me think. If you like books that are interesting, and make you think about certain things in our world today, then you should read The Giver.
B0000AFX64|4.0|I saw this at the movies when I was a kid and found it thrilling. Watching this DVD brought back good memories. I got a chill just watching. Thanks Amazon.
B000127LW2|4.0|I won't belabor or repeat what has been said many times, many ways about the series itself...you can read other reviews for that. <br /> <br />My beef is with the crappy packaging. For $100 apiece you'd think you'd get something of higher quality and that you didn't have to wrestle with every time you open it! <br /> <br />That's my 2 cents...
B0002YLC24|4.0|The bottom line is that this film is all about its characters and the dialogue they share between eachother.  I adored the first film (Before Sunrise), which Celine and Jessie met and spent a magical night together in Vienna, Austria.  Why do I love these films?  Because I, and perhaps others, have travelled overseas and can relate to the situations and anxiety of meeting foreign people you could possible fall in love with for one reason or another.  Before Susnet is beatiful because the characters actually meet again so many years later.  You immediately discover the anxiety and connection still exists without a pause.  However, the circumstances have changed.  Jessie is married with children, while Celine is still single, neurotic, and searching for a deeper meaning in human relationships.  Though we suspect the circumstances will keep them apart, we are stil cheering for them.  Without spoiling the ending, I can say that Linklater ended the film at the right moment, even though perhaps we still desire more.  The only reason I give this film 4 out of 5 stars is due to the lenght.  But I am definitely pleased with story.  Celine and Jessie definitely create magice in the space they occupy together.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen had all the ingredients for a great rock band. A scorching guitarist, a charismatic lead singer w/ a great rock voice, and a good rhythm section to hold it all together. The album opens with the classic Runnin With The Devil. I like the fact that Eddie was not afraid to play a simple, yet very melodic, solo. Next is Ed's masterpiece, Eruption. It's hard to believe this was 1978 because no other guitarist at the time had ever done anything like it. After that is VH's cover of the Kink's You Really Got Me, a version that takes the original and sets it on fire. Ain't Talkin Bout Love has a simple but very cool riff. Again Ed plays a simple but memorable guitar solo. After that I'm The One has a hot guitar riff and great vocals from Dave. The rest of the album is cool as well but I always found myself listening mostly to the first side of the record (back in the days of vinyl!). Van Halen put out some other great albums like Woman & Children First etc. but I don't think they ever topped this album. Van Halen is one of the greatest debuts ever!
B000687M48|5.0|Evanescence's new CD is from their live Paris concert, in which they sang all the songs from Fallen, with one new song (Missing). I really love it. Amy Lee sings live, so her voice sings some of the songs differently, while the clarity and right-on-pitchness of her singing is haunting. Can really tell she's moulding each song and making them special, different inflections than the Fallen CD, definitely no boring lip-syncing.  The guitars and drums and additional instruments really make the songs come alive.    Also, there's the live crowd aspect of it which makes the songs even more electrifying. I've never been big on concert CDs, but this was really fantastic, I'm very happy with it.     In addition, there's also a bonus DVD covering THE ENTIRE PARIS CONCERT, ALL THEIR MUSIC VIDEOS, and an hour of behind the scene looks at the band. The CD and DVD are in a regular-thickness CD case, so no bulky big box thing to deal with, very compact.    So if you don't want pay the cash to hear the same songs from Fallen, don't buy it.     But if you love the songs, and would like to hear Amy Lee sing them with a different energy, and beautiful renditions, with a crowd roaring their love of the songs, PLUS the entire live DVD recording of the Paris concert PLUS all their music videos, PLUS some goofy videos of the band, then this price is super-cheap.    [...]    And see if you like the concert renditions of the songs.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|If the viewer does not own any of the Matrix movies, then this is the collection to own. It contains the three Matrix films plus \\"The Animatrix\\" -- just to buy them each individually would cost you a dollar more than the overall price of this collection. <br /> <br />Basically, seven of the ten DVD discs have been released previously: each of the three Matrix movies had a film DVD with a bonus disc that is included here with minor additions plus \\"The Animatrix\\" DVD which contained nine animated shorts. <br /> <br />The three new discs covers behind the scenes material about the production, philosophy and key interviews with the cast and crew of the trilogy. Even if the viewer is not a hard core Matrix fan, the  four films themselves are worth the cost of this set without any of the extras included.  <br /> <br />In 1999, \\"The Matrix\\" won 4 Oscars for its ground-breaking visuals effects, sound and editing. This sci-fi trilogy is a stunning and visually beautiful film to watch in its entirety.
B00005JMUL|5.0|The POLAR EXPRESS is the picture of the year in IMAX 3-D.  I can't imagine how it might look any other way.  The compositions would be the same, but the dimensionality of the movie really floors you, knocks you out, and I think perhaps the 3-effects help you enjoy Alan Silvestri's music more, even down to the magical sleighbells that our little hero cannot hear.<br /><br />The songs are to be cherished.  I couldn't make out the lyrics of the choral number, \\"The Spirit of the Season,\\" but it is something I would like to have the choir in my church sing during their rehearsals for the Nutcracker Suite.  One of my favorite music numbers is the bizarre, minimal \\"Hot Chocolate\\" barked out by Tom Hanks and a chorus of singing waiters in a take off of an old Cotton Club/Cab Calloway style.  Hanks really doesn't have a good singing voice, does he, and he's straining himself trying to get through a number even where all he has to say is, \\"Hot, hot,\\" a dozen times.  In general when Hanks was off the screen I liked the movie better.  I couldn't help but think that he was hogging up all the action by trying to put his brand on every male character in the show, right down to the evil Scrooge puppet, and trying to play one character and the father to that character is stupid, if you ask me, but they say Warner Brothers paid him $25 million dollars to play in the show, so maybe they figured they would milk him for all he's worth.  Peter Sellers used to play many characters-and Alec Guinness-I didn't like it when they did it either, to tell you the truth.<br /><br />Steven Tyler from Aerosmith has a few cute moments as an elf singing, \\"Rocking On Top Of The World.\\"<br /><br />The movie has you in tears from approximately 40:15 on.  When the little black girl and the poor boy who's afraid of Christmas disappointment, get together at the back of the club car and sing, \\"When Christmas Comes To Town,\\" it is the signal to unleash all the tears you've ever wanted to shed about the world's injustice and also the beauty of the world that the young girl seems to be arguing in favor of.  If the Christmas season can produce such wonderful feelings of love, then it is a shame it cannot last all year.world's injustice and also the beauty of the world that the young girl seems to be arguing in favor of.

B00005JLZN|4.0|Set in the good ol' boy state of Texas, Kevin Spacey is Dr. David Gale, a brilliant university professor, accomplished author and comrade of a group called \\"DeathWatch\\" that vehemently opposes capital punishment/death penalty. David has a beautiful wife and little son but when his wife leaves him and takes his child away, David goes off the deep end,becomes an alcoholic and looses his tenured position at the university due to some allegations of a young student.<br /><br />Then, if things couldn't get any worse, David's closest friend & \\"DeathWatch\\" colleague, Constance Harroway, played by Laura Linney, turns up raped and violently murdered, David, of course, is the prime suspect. What with David's DNA taken from the crime scene he is tried, convicted and placed on death row to await his execution by lethal injection.  He steadfastly denies any guilt in the murder while sitting on death row for several years. The story opens four days before Gale is to receive his state induced deadly drug cocktail.<br /><br />Enter reporter Bitsey Bloom, played by Kate Winslet.  Bitsey is brought in to interview David in 3 separate 2 hour sessions.  The story of David's crime is all told in flashback sequence. With an ending so terrific it will literally knock the wind right out of you!<br /><br />Also turning in fine performances are Gabriel Mann as Bitsey's co-worker, Zack Stemmons, a creepy, opera loving cowboy, Matt Craven as \\"DeathWatch\\" obsessed member, Dusty Wright and a young girl named Melissa McCarthy who turns in an adequate performance as a Goth girl named Nico.<br /><br />This movie is scripted well, keeps you guessing and more importantly, the punch in the stomach the story gives you in the end is well worth the watch.<br /><br />Highly Recommended & Happy Watching!
B0002VC924|3.0|Before starting my review, I should probably say that for the most part, I agree with Michael Moore's politics. I dislike president Bush and his regime, and think they have been very destructive in their first term (here's hoping the second term isn't so bad). That being said, Moore's controversial &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; is a disappointingly mixed bag. Unlike &quot;Roger and Me&quot; or &quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; it's straight propoganda. Moore hits the audience over the head with his message, giving this reviewer a severe headache by the film's close. While Moore doesn't appear on camera as much as his previous films, his narration is near-constant - his narration combined with the endless news footage and documents gives this an irritating &quot;slide show&quot; or &quot;court case&quot; feeling. While Moore's previous films had interesting human stories, &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; gives us only the plight of Flint war mother Lila Lipscomb. Moore attempts some of his trademark pranking, but it's unsatisfactory (particularly in the awkward Patriot Act scene - a prank that peters out before a punchline). After a while, the film just gets dull. That being said, there is still plenty good to say about it - the scene where Lipscomb goes to capitol hill is undeniably moving, and much of the &quot;found footage&quot; (Bush in the classroom reading &quot;My Pet Goat,&quot; the unforgettable &quot;Now watch this drive&quot; scene) is great, and many of the individual scenes (the opening, homeland security) are well done.<BR>The DVD has the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Since a startling amount of this movie is grainy news footage, there really isn't much the DVD can (or should) do. Suffice to say, the image looks good enough. The real value of the DVD is in the extras. Some of the extras, especially the scene with Condelleza Rice (&quot;I believe it was called 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the US'&quot;) and the documentary about Arab American comedians. The worst extra is about the release of the film, which is fifteen solid minutes of people saying what a great guy Michael Moore is - dull, dull, dull! Another extra worth checking out is the theatrical trailer, which is surprisingly effective.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is by far the most melodic album i have ever heard from Greenday. Greenday matured with age but havent lost touch of there roots which have never been clear punk, alternative or rock. They have always blazed there own path and this new album is a clear sighn. I cant say it resembles any past greenday album although you may fine sighns of a Nimrod or a 1039. A good alaround album but watch out like all good (not great) albums it can get old if overplayed.
0446677450|3.0|As a high school student I found this book to be very insightful.  I learned that a college education is not enough to enough to make one rich since school educates students to be good employees rather than successful moneymakers.  This realization has caused me to really think about my future.  I will continue to work hard in the classroom, but I will also make an effort to financially educate myself. <br /> <br />Although the book taught me this valuable lesson, I was disappointed in the way it was written.  Kiyosaki is extremely redundant making the book a lot longer than it needed to be.  <br />
B000002A46|5.0|I have hundreds of CD's, but this is the only Mariah Carey album I own. So I'm not just another bubble-gum pop fan. That said, I think this is the BEST CHRITMAS ALBUM EVER. Certainly the best Gospel Christmas album. On this album, backed by a great orchestra and a fine Choral/Gospel choir, Mariah is able to showcase the awesome 9-Octave range of her spectacular voice. This is truly touching and inspirational holiday music. I have given this CD as a Christmas Gift many, many times, and it has always gotten rave reviews from the recipients. I never tire of listening to it, and it is a cherished holiday tradition at my house. Even if like me, you are not usually a Mariah Carey fan, this is a must have album.
0440238609|1.0|I, for one, was deeply disappointed with this series.  Many people have already written on the jack-hammer like subtlety with which Mr. Pullman drives home his atheistic world view.  What hasn't been brought up, however, is how poorly Mr. Pullman understands the religion he is trying to critique.  For all his spite and venom against Christianity, the name \\"Jesus\\" (he being a pretty important guy in that religion, I hear) is mentioned twice, and both times in passing.  Likewise, Mr. Pullman displays a shocking lack of understanding concerning the doctrine of original sin, which appears to be the main target for his thinly-veiled mudslinging.  So much so, in fact, that at certain points I actually began to feel bad for him.  Showing this much ignorance to so many people must be terribly embarrassing.  In the end, the totality of Mr. Pullman's argument against all religion seems to be \\"some people who believe in God do bad things.\\"  Bravo, sir.  Your ability to awkwardly repeat the obvious over a thousand pages is unmatched.<br /><br />If my main difficulties with this series were philosophical or theological, however, I would possibly have considered giving it more than one star.  As it is, I wish I could give fewer.  I am no great fan of C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, but I find the comparisons of this trilogy to Tolkien's body of work and the Harry Potter series appalling.  In both Tolkien and Rowling's novels, it is quite easy for the reader to tell that there is far more to the world that the characters inhabit than what is being revealed on the page.  When reading about Middle Earth and Hogwarts, the reader is given the feeling that he or she is on a safari; seeing only a small portion of a living and breathing universe that stretches far beyond the page's horizon.  In the worlds of Mr. Pullman, however, (and I would level this same criticism at Lewis) the reader has much more the sense of riding the tram at the Epcot Center.  Everything is very pretty, overly convenient, and brilliantly defined.  If we were to step off the tram, however, we would find nothing behind the carefully drawn backgrounds but convoluted machinery.  It is an incredibly shallow world.<br /><br />I would not dream of making these remarks without providing examples to back up my statements, so here they are.  This list is certainly not exhaustive, but I don't feel like going back through these books again.  Suffice it to say, if I can pick these off the top head, many more lie just below the surface:  (Spoilers Ahead)<br /><br />1)  Lyra is prophesized to betray someone, and we are later told that this betrayal occurs when she leaves Pan to go to the island of the dead.  Really, though, it's not a betrayal.  It's just a choice of a necessary evil.  No vow has been broken.  That the reader must be explicitly told that this event is the forewarned betrayal shows just how unsatisfactorily the prophecy is fulfilled.<br /><br />2)  As the reader, we are told that bears are impossible to trick.  Yet, a hundred or so pages later, Lyra does just this with ease.  How?  By saying \\"I have to go into another room.\\"  Mmm, very sneaky.  Those un-trickable bears could never have seen through that.<br /><br />3)  The subtle knife is supposed to be used to kill the Authority.  It doesn't.  Kind of a bummer.<br /><br />4)  During the long, slow, and largely pointless falling action after the final battle, Mary is watching the clouds flow against the current of dust and beings to wonder why they appear to have purposeful movement; as if they were either fleeing from or hastening towards something. \\"But what this was,\\" writes Pullman, \\"Mary would never know.\\"  Four pages later, she knows.<br /><br />5)  The final, heart-rending conclusion, in which Lyra and Will must live forever separated in their own worlds, is brought about solely by a convoluted plot trick implemented in the last fifty pages.  You see, they can only keep one door open, even though there's never been a reason till a reason was needed.  Not even, say, one and a little one will do.  Or one and then make-one-real-quick-close-it-behind-your-and-then-have-the-angels-kill-the-solitary-specter-that-pops-out, (since they say they'll have no problem killing all the thousands that already exist).  Never mind, of course, that with hundreds of doors left open for decades, the universe has survived for three hundred years.  No sir, only one, forever and ever, because it's sadder that way.  Now where'd I put my hankie.<br /><br />The only thing that boggles me is why so many people love this series, and why it has won awards.  When I read the gushing, five star reviews here at Amazon I scratch my head and wonder if I've read the same books as everyone else.  Perhaps I have, and am just missing something.  Or, perhaps I'm In some kind of alternate universe in which these books are really, really bad.  Whatever the case, I wish I had been in one where I had never read these books.

B00006D295|5.0|After quitting the London cast of Jesus Christ Superstar over creative differences, actor Richard O'Brien needed an activity to fill some idle time.  He started tinkering with an idea for a rock musical play that would combine all the things that \\"give you a buzz,\\" from horror and science-fiction films to comedy and glam rock.  Impressed by the media coverage of Alice Cooper's recent concert assaults on London, O'Brien created what he initially called an \\"Alice Cooper type Frankenstein\\" character named Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who would build a blond muscleman for his own pleasure.  The rough idea for \\"Rock Horroar\\" went into rehearsals as \\"They Came From Denton High,\\" and was finally retitled \\"The Rocky Horror Show\\" before opening an intended three-week run (expanded to five) at the 63-seat Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in June 1973.  It transferred to larger theatres and ran for seven years before being revived.After winning major London theatre awards, The Rocky Horror Show was staged in America with Tim Curry at Lou Adler's Roxy Theatre in L.A. in March 1974.  During its ten-month run there, Lou Adler teamed with producer Michael White to produce a film version in England, using most of the English cast (Curry, O'Brien, Nell, Quinn, Adams) and singing discovery Meat Loaf from the Roxy cast.  After the play's failed month on Broadway, The Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered in London on August 14, 1975, and struggled to find its audience.    The film closely follows the satiric tone of the play, deriving its humor from stilted, deadpan sci-fi dialogue mixed with gender-bending imagery and loud rock and roll. It subverts classic science-fiction films by having the innocent Brad and Janet incredulously confront an outrageous alien mad doctor in place of a bug-eyed monster, as though Alice Cooper had renovated Dr. Frankenstein's lab for a musical version of It Came From Outer Space.  The cast is a wonderful collection of cartoonish eccentrics: Tim Curry's androgynous Frank; Richard O'Brien's weird, balding hunchback Riff Raff; Little Nell's squeaking, pink-haired groupie Columbia; Meat Loaf's tenor-voiced biker Eddie; Peter Hinwood's perfectly pumped beefcake Rocky Horror.The film is worth seeing on the big screen, for the \\"audience participation\\" and Jim Sharman's detailed use of the frame, but holds up equally well on DVD.  Before audiences celebrated their love of the film by vocally including themselves in the experience, there was the film.  By turns energetic when introducing the alien dance craze \\"The Time Warp,\\" ponderous when satirizing the pomposity of over-serious 50s sci-fi films, and sexually challenging when Tim Curry's Joan Crawford-esque Frank gazes into the camera (in tribute to Jean-Luc Godard, Jim Sharman's favorite director), The Rocky Horror Picture Show works as a strangely seductive musical fantasy, cleverly blending Richard O'Brien's pop culture obsessions into a multicolored collage that holds the secret- to life- itself!
B000286S8S|1.0|Eddie Van Halen, although a gifted guitarist, apparently doesn't know what the fans want - a live Dave Era Album.  I'm sure somewhere, deep in the 5150 vault is a screamingly, loud blast from the past.  A testament to what this band used to be - the baddest band on the planet.  Instead, we get badly sung versions of DLR era songs by a fat slob who obviously hates singing them.<br /><br />If I wanted to hear classic VH songs butchered by an obnoxious drunk, I'd go to a kareoke bar.  This album is prime example of Eddie trying to tell us what to like.  Sorry Ed - I'm just not buying it, and the smart fans won't buy it either.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is definately a worthwhile book to read.  He takes us through his childhood, good or bad, both perspectives are shown. (Although hardly anything good had happened to him)  Sharing his life with us was truly an experience and I admire him for doing so.   <br /> <br />On the flip side, this book lacked an ending.  \\"I'm in america\\"- The end.  I think he should have also focused a bit more on his mother Angela as he did entitle the book after her.  I also think he was constantly repititive in every chapter, \\"Oh my dad drank all his dole money away\\", \\"We are poor\\", \\"excitement\\" <br /> <br />I still give this book a 4 star rating because it was a good book, just some flaws that I personally think McCourt could have worked on.
B00068IOWM|3.0|With the amount of time, resources and talent on call for U2 albums these days we should expect brilliant work at each release.  There is something missing here and I'm not sure what it is yet - it all drifts pass and leaves very little impression. <br /> <br />Three things stand out to me as problems here... <br /> <br />1. Larry's drumming is lost in the mix.  Listen to War, Joshua Tree and Achtung for example - his playing should be a highlight! <br /> <br />2. Some of Bono's lyrics are very ordinary and in places sounds like jnr high poetry.  \\"All because of you\\" has to be U2's most annoying song, that chorus is a shocker. <br /> <br />3. Track running order is terrible.  The album doesn't flow at all and you're left feeling a bit frustrated. <br /> <br />All in all...disappointing.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I am not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I love her in this movie.  No one else could be Emma, in my opinion.  She shines in the title character, and creates headaches for all who know her.  And check out the gorgeous Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightly; wish he was my friend!  Emma plays matchmaker for a couple of her friends, sometimes she hits and more often she misses.  Watch as she learns not just some hard lessons about relationships, but also what her heart most desires.  This movie has it all--humor, romance, drama, and Jeremy Northam.  This is the perfect \\"chick flick\\" movie.  See it with friends, or the one you love.  But make sure you see it!  And did I mention the gorgeous Jeremy Northam?
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Wicked tells the fantastic story and Glinda and Elphaba, two of the good and bad witches of OZ.  Even though I have not seen the show, through this music the album clearly tells their story.  Some songs are dull and unnecessary (\\"Wonderful\\", \\"March of the Witch Hunters\\") while some stick in your head for hours (\\"Popular\\", \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\").  The opening song is a lot less upbeat and happy than most musicals, but that was refreshing in my opinion.  Idina Menzel as Elphaba really shines on her tracks especially the passionate \\"The Wizard and I\\" and the fiery \\"No Good Deed\\".  It really is a beautiful story of two unlikely people becoming friends and teachiing each other about life.  For this reason the songs sung by the Wizard just seem really forced, (they're not bad songs, it just strays from the actual focus on the play).  I always skip through these songs because I find the songs with Kristen Chenowith and Menzel extremely original and beautiful.  One of my favorites is the second to last song of the show called \\"For Good\\" where the two witches sing about how they feel the other has changed them.  The song is both richly hearfelt and sadly haunting.  This album amazed me.  Pick it up if you're a fan of the story, Broadway, or just beautiful music.  Wicked is wicked!
B00006JKOL|5.0|The Minstrel in the Gallery holds a special place in the Jethro Tull catalogue, and it is probably my all time favorite album by the band (which is saying a lot). Here is the quintessential lineup of personnel: along with Anderson and Barre, there is John Evans on keyboards, Barrimore Barlow on percussion, and in his final musical appearance, the bassist who holds a singular place in Tull folklore and legend, Jeffrey Hammond (Hammond).<br /><br />This album is largely acoustic, featuring a more than usual helping of Ian strumming his guitar and meandering through many lovely tunes, accentuated by Martin Barres' blistering electric guitar licks. Probably the element that I enjoy the most in this album is David Palmer's orchestration. The lush violins and cellos add a wonderful ambience to the music that really hasn't been achieved since in any Tull offering.<br /><br />Back in the days when I listened to this on a vinyl album, it was always side B that sent shivers down my spine. One White Duck / 0-10 = Nothing At All and the whole Baker Street Muse Medley remain as my favorite Tull tunes of all time. The bonus tracks on this remaster are true gems as well. Once considered \\"obscure rarities,\\" Summerday Sands, March The Mad Scientist and Pan Dance are all here, and the CD would be worth the money for these tracks alone! The disc ends with two partial live performances from a radio broadcast from the mid 70's.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed the little spoken bits scattered throughout the album as well. I remember picking up the needle many dozens of times until I finally got all the words right. From Ian declaring \\"so there\\" at the end of One White Duck, the infamous retake on the introduction to Baker St. Muse, (not suitable for publication here), to him exclaiming \\"I can't get out!\\" right before Grace, these little sound bytes add to the charm of the album.<br /><br />As for the wonderful introduction, it is provided by none other than David Palmer, acting as the master of ceremonies to a medieval royal court. As we hear a man and woman devouring their savory meal, he begins: \\"My Lord and Lady, we have fortuitously happened upon these, uh...strolling players to provide you with their goodly tunes whilst you set about your, uh... prandial delights, albeit in the lamentable absence of your guests. So, my lord and lady, for your entertainment......\\"<br /><br />Martin Barre: \\"Are we really going to go through with this?\\"<br /><br />Ian Anderson: \\"Yea, I suppose we better had, I can't see down there alright, [it]'swhy I'm gonna like this place. The minstrel in the gallery...\\"  and it all begins. It's really a great album.val royal court.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I think this is one of the best albums to come out of the ninties. Thom Yorke is a great vocalist, i admit every song on this album is not great, but if you are a true rock fan then you will appreciate it. <br />as for that person putting avril lavigne better than radiohead, and even stranger, thom yorke imitating avril lavignes singing????? hmm, i dont even think avril was BORN when radiohead started. shes about 8 isnt she?? anyway, thom yorke is a million times better at singing than any forgotten-in-24-seconds-flat pop star. while pop disapears back into the hole of stupidness it appeared from, radiohead will be remembered for many years.
B000000WZ4|5.0|If you like the more dancy and upbeat side of DM, this album is probably not for you.  But if you like the good lyrics, dark atmosphere and emotional side of DM, this is probably the CD for you.  While it is not the best album in regards to production, but it is their best in conveying the atmosphere and emotion the band was in while making the album.  Martin words are at his best here.
B00008LOS1|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest albums in my collection, and the Deluxe edition only makes it better.  In fact, I prefer the Record Plant version of \\"Getting In Tune\\" to the album version.  Plus, the second disc only adds to the power of this album. <br /> <br />Disc One is the album itself, with a couple bonus tracks.  There's not really much to say that hasn't already been said about the album.  It's one of those albums that you can listen to straight through.  It also is the true definition of an \\"album,\\" where each song can stand alone, but the songs together form a cohesive unit.  Tommy, and Quadrophenia to a lesser extent, were albums where every song fit together, but each song did not stand alone.  The bonus tracks are definitely a welcome gift.  My favorite has to be \\"Pure And Easy\\", even in its slightly unpolished form, it's a hidden gem that definitely could have fit on the album.  Another interesting track is the alternate take of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\"  The square wave pattern is much different (I like it better than the album version) and the band was playing with the square wave played live, rather than from a tape.  The takes of \\"Getting In Tune,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" and an electrified \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" are also really good. <br /> <br />The second disc, as I said before, only adds to the power of this album, and it also shows how The Who could take their songs, which were dressed up in the studio, and play them live and not have them sound empty (something Led Zeppelin excelled at also).  \\"Bargain\\" and \\"Getting In Tune\\" sound really good even without the synthesizer (which Daltrey sings the part of) and the piano (whose part is played by Pete on the guitar).  You also get a live version of \\"Pure And Easy,\\" which is great.  \\"Young Man Blues\\" is good, as usual, and \\"My Generation\\" is as well.  The gems on here are the unreleased songs, like \\"Time Is Passing,\\" \\"I Don't Even Know Myself,\\" \\"Too Much Of Anything,\\" and \\"Road Runner.\\"  \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is pretty good live, although this version doesn't seem to hit me as hard as the album version, that is until Daltrey's scream at the end. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an essential record from one of the greatest bands of the 70's, so if you haven't bought it already, you definitely need to.  This was my first Who record and now I'm a huge fan.
0156027321|5.0|I got this book by mistake and I had no idea what style or genre it was, but I was bored, so I gave it a try. For me, what makes a book an exceptional read is if I feel like it should still be going on after I finish it, or if the world created in the book is more real than the real world while I'm reading it, or it still haunts me after the book is finished. Well, I read this one in April and it's now December and the book haunts me still. The begining almost turned me off, but the body of the story held me and the ending caught me off guard; I didn't expect the ending from either the literary angle or the emotional angle. Other reviewers say that the reader is able to 'choose' which ending he or she prefers to believe, but after really thinking about the story as a whole, and a couple of clues in the final chapters, I believe that there is really only one ending, but that in no way detracts from the magic of Pi's journey. There is humor, peril and soul searching, the ingredients of a good adventure. All I know is that this book is one of the few that I can say I'm glad I accidentally read.
B000002OX7|5.0|To this listener's ears, 'Who's Next' remains the greatest rock 'n roll album of all time thus far.  All the others that are frequently mentioned --- 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Led Zeppelin IV', 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Pet Sounds', etc. --- still, in my opinion, don't hold a candle to this one.  The album is perfectly sequenced, the production is impeccable, the songwriting is a perfect blend of wistfulness, pathos, humor, and politics both personal and general, and the musicianship captures the Who at their peak (if anyone needs further convincing that John Entwistle and Keith Moon were the greatest rhythm section in the history of rock, this album ought to do it).   <br /> <br />Ultimately, I think, 'Who's Next' captures perfectly the disillusionment that existed at the beginning of the '70's following the collapse of the '60's utopian dream and its ideals.  One only needs to refer to 'Baba O'Riley''s themes of a \\"teenage wasteland\\" and 'Won't Get Fooled Again''s notions that \\"...there's nothing in the streets, looks any different to me, and the slogans are replaced by and by...\\", and than when our leaders get elected, the new boss is \\"same as the old boss\\". <br />Sadly, these themes remain more real than ever today, as greed and personal contentment outweigh the interests of community and common good.  Pete Townshend. to this day, probably ranks right alongside Bruce Springsteen as rock's most \\"human\\" songwriter. <br /> <br />The album, I think, often gets overlooked in the way rankings are compiled on 'greatest albums-of-all-time' polls because the Who have, in recent years, fallen in critical opinion for their insistence to remain a nostalgic touring act in the absence of new material.  Regardless, 'Who's Next' remains a powerful masterpiece of tasteful technology (i.e., the synthesizer), brilliant songwriting, and four musicians at the top of their game.  Another masterpiece would still be forthcoming from this magnificent band ('Quadrophenia'), but this can rightly beconsidered the Who's summit. <br /> <br />As one previous reviewer said, it doesn't get more classic than this.
B000002KGT|5.0|i certainly think so. takes some breaking in--because the sound is truly different than anything most people are used to. it sort of goes beyond a purely musical concept of pop music--more than anything else, i think this is an album people can truly bond over, that friends can celebrate together. exquisite, graceful, and timeless, it will always be my personal favorite.
B0002F6BRE|3.0|This is a cute, lighthearted holiday movie - good for younger kids. Older kids will think it is pretty lame. Some adults might think so too - as it is somewhat silly.  <br />It's not bad, Will Ferrel does a good job, and he is quite funny and entertaining, it's just the rest of the cast isn't all that great.
0156027321|3.0|I had only heard wonderful things about Life of Pi by Yann Martel, so I suppose I had built myself up for a transforming experience.  The book fell quite short of my expectations.   <br /> <br />One of the most intriguing claims was \\"this book will make you believe in God.\\"  If this was what inspired you to pick up this book, I suggest, instead, reading \\"Calculating God\\" by Robert Sawyer.  It is much more fulfilling.   <br /> <br />This book was long, sometimes overwritten and pretentious.  Yet the details were often engaging; Martel uses vivid language, but it all had a vague spiritual haze over it.  I kept waiting for some revelation, or some loftier theme to give meaning to Pi's experience, and it never came.  You, the reader, will have to make that connection if you so desire.  The ending is thought-provoking. <br /> <br />There are some interesting facts about zoology and the animal world--you will come away feeling a bit smarter--and it is a survival story in its truest form.  <br /> <br />I finished it without yawning, anyway.  It's decent.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|This video made me wish I was able to go to one of their concerts. If you play guitar, it will make you want Jack's red and white Gibson Firebird. <br />This disc is better than most live concert videos. The low-fi video works, and the cut aways are timed well. They do a few covers, so there is some material on here that isn't on their four major releases.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Honestly, I was a bit concerned on how funny ELF might be considering it's PG rating and the probability of the comedy being dulled down for the kiddies.  Turns out the rating didn't hinder the film in the least bit and I found it to be a laugh-out-loud good time, featuring a suprisingly smart and relevant Christmas tale.  However, if you don't enjoy a little touch of silliness, lots of maple syrup, and gratuitous displays of belching, steer your sled down a different Holiday path. <br /> <br />Will Ferrel plays the starring role of \\"Buddy The Elf\\" with goofish abandon, showcasing his talent for making the simplest comic gestures turn out hillarious. Don't overlook James Caan who turns in a splendid performance of his own, playing the reluctant, bewildered Father of \\"Buddy.\\"  Spot-on contributions are also delivered by the pleasantly cynical Zooey Deschanel and the wry elfishness of Bob Newhart.  All in all, this was an enjoyable Holiday ride, abound with gaggish laughs and outrageous goofball comedy.  Maybe this movie was designed for younger kids, but this big kid couldn't help having a jolly ol' time.
0385336810|4.0|This is book was very entertaining. A Cute story about a woman making her way in the business world, and at the same time dealing with romance.<br /><br />There are lots of parts that will make you laugh out loud. Any woman trying to balance work and romance can see herself in these situations.<br /><br />A fun, light, humorous read. I was very entertained.
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|Why bother making a sequal movie like this. Disney should never made a update movie after Wizard of OZ.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I've been in love with the story of Peter Pan for many many years, thanks to my mum. I dismissed this version, when I first heard of it, as a family film and not much more. Truth be told I was afraid that they would make a carbon copy of the Disney film, Hook a coward and Wendy a damsel in distress. How wrong I was. The actors (all of them) did a superb job of rounding out their characters, the writing was very true to the original story, the costumes were magnificent without being overly done (as they had been in 'Hook') and the sets were rich in feeling and tone. The movie was magical, as should be.<br /><br />Jason Isaacs (as seen in the Harry Potter movies as Lucius Malfoy) was incredible as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook. Captain Hook being my favorite literary character of all time, I was very suspicious of how he would handle him. He created depth and subtext in Hook I had not previously considered. His performance was outstanding.<br /><br />Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wendy Darling was a treat as well. Playing Wendy as a capable girl who is strong and self reliant, yet charming and delicate. And this being her first movie, I suggest keeping an eye on her...<br /><br />And finally, to talk of Pan himself, Jeremy Sumpter as the lead role was excellently casted. He gave the role the more depth then previous roles, played him as an adolescent rather then child and pulled it off wonderfully.<br /><br />Yes, it is a children's story, a family move (which gets groans when mentioned) but this is one not to miss. Truly a gem for anyone and especially those who have ever dreamt of Neverland, or wish to return.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|this album is great for every metal person who lives in pennsylvania that who has to listen to classic rock ,rap,or alternative. why can't USA produce bands like this.this band is awsome. I can't find one wrong thing with this band there awsome.There here to  bring metal back to the   USA.
037571412X|5.0|I have read much of Roth's oeuvre, but this book was intriguing in a different way than many of his other books.  Roth always offers interesting insights into relationships that are apart from typical and accepted moral views held by most Americans.  For myself, this is refreshing.  In this particular book, Roth enters the inchoate stages of a dialogue concerning what an affair can become, the fact that it is a series of moments rather than one long relationship, and that it can involve more than sex.   <br />  This is not a book I would recommend to all readers.  Rather, this is a book to be selectively read by those who fall into the same category as the best friend of David Kepesh (the main character of the novel), who Kepesh claims within the novel to be the only friend who did not morally judge Kepesh's actions or attempt to present him with a pious or self-righteous attitude.  For those who can withhold judgment, this is a marvelous, insightful novella that speaks not only about lust, but about beauty, age, and mortality.
0060005688|5.0|I love this book--it provides a popularized introduction to the newest research into how we deal with the astonishingly rapid rise of available choices.  The opening dialogue is sobering--we live in a world of near infinite variety, where something as simple as purchasing a pair of jeans becomes a complex task worthy of examination.<br /><br />Mr. Schwartz takes the premise that the availability of choices comes with a psychic price--an intriguing notion that we are literally incapable of confronting our own world without instituting various defensive strategies that are only now yielding their secrets to research of the most creative and interesting sort.  (The book is worth reading just for its description of some of the more elegant social research strategies.)<br /><br />The happy and contented among us (who are also the more effective) have, according to Mr. Schwartz, managed to craft a strategy whereby choices are limited in advance by setting boundaries on what is chosen, by what process, and, especially, how much time and effort will go into any decision.  Imagine that!  A book that advocates self-restraint as a means to a more rewarding life and has science to back it up.
0739313118|4.0|I listened to the book on tape of the Di Vinci Code. I thought the tape was very well done.<br /><br />I found the characters very interesting, and the plot fast-paced with alot of interesting twists. Maybe a few to many plot twists, towards the end it was getting like a wild-goose-chase and I was wondering if the book was ever going to end.<br /><br />The book held my interest. And I found alot of the religious references really interesting as well, but remember it is fiction. This is a good work of fiction to read if you really want to be completely captivated by the plot and characters.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Let's face it... this movie is one of those box-office hits of the month. While this movie is surely popular with sports car enthusiasts nation wide, there is relatively no real drama anywhere in the film. This was a definitive characteristic of the original \\"Gone in 60 Seconds,\\" only the car chase in it was much more entertaining... and much longer. And although there is not one single dynamic character in the entire film... that's not really the point, is it?<br /><br />The point is that with a big enough budget, some big-name actors, and action producer Capo Jerry B., people are going to be entertained. There are actually some exciting car chases, as well as some interesting cop and robber interaction. However, the plot driven narative makes for plenty of tongue in cheek moments, albeit taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />At the end of the day, \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" might keep your attention long enough to realize that you should have just watched \\"The Rock,\\" Jerry B. and Nic Cage's action packed masterpiece. Nevertheless... this film is not bad. The movie is fun, and the cars really do make your mouth water; I was definitely convinced by Eleanor, as well as her little red button.<br /><br />In the end, there is one huge problem with the film... the Lamborghini Diablo has minimal screen time... come on people!!! I know they had the car rented long enough to give it some decent screen time and maybe a car chase or two... but nooooooo; just Nic stealing the car and driving away, and that is it. It's such a crying shame. If you want get a good look at a Diablo, as well as see one in action, watch \\"Bedazzled.\\"<br /><br />I only recommend buying this movie under three different circumstances. One: in one of those cheap two packs... Two: used at a dirt cheap price... Three:  the next time it appears in a Sunday newspaper ad or on Amazon.com for less than 10 dollars.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I'm only sorry that I didn't hear of Elliott Smith sooner.  This album moves with me from home, to car, to work, and back again.  I had only heard a few songs of his before owning this album, but it is already one of my favorites.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I am not into toilet humour much at all, but even I found Team America: World Police, funny. <br />The film creates satire based on issues reported throughout media of recent times regarding terrorist threats and weapons of mass destruction. <br />Political satire etcetera aside, the toilet humour I would normal find pathetic, was placed well enough to appeal to my dry sense of humour. <br />I liked it.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Matt Damon's career was near dead in the water, until 'The Bourne Identity' rescued him (he himself has intimated as much).  I don't think moviegoers really thought of Damon as an action star before 'Identity', but that's all changed now.  With 'The Bourne Supremacy' Damon does another turn as the troubled amnesiac spy/assassin Jason Bourne, and what a trip it is the second time around!<br /><br />This film is portrayed through the Bourne character's eyes and mind.  Everything moves at a breakneck on-the-fly pace, reflecting Bourne's reflexive reactions to unanticipated circumstances.  His near automatic responses seem able to get him out of almost any disaster-but Bourne is developing a consience, and feels guilty about some of his shadowy operations.<br /><br />Damon is joined by well-cast group of character actors such as Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Karl Urban as a Russian assassin.  They add real meat to the high octane mix of this film.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers about the manic cutting and camera shake-it is disconcerting at times.  Apparently some directors feel it is 'artsy' to do this, but it is just an irritant in this case. Other than the camera work, this is a fine action film that owes a great deal to masters of the genre (John Frankenheimer comes to mind-this film reminded me of 'Ronin').<br /><br />I enjoyed this one even more than the first film, but have to subtract one star for the overediting and camera shake.  These do have their place in an action film, but have been a bit overdone here.  Nevertheless, this is one heck of a movie...4 stars!
B000002NJM|4.0|This is an excellent soundtrack collection, the songs for the film fit perfectly into the theme.  If you're a fan of soul music, after seeing the film you'll probably immediately jump at the chance to own this soundtrack.  That's where I was coming from. <br /> <br />Most of the songs that you hear from the film are all here.  You can be sure that the stand out moments of the movie with their related music is all here.  From the opening segment with Bobby Womack's \\"Across 110th Street\\", to \\"Inside My Love\\" and of course The Delfonics' \\"Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time\\" which is almost the theme song for the movie.  This is not purely a soul soundtrack, although Johnny Cash's \\"Tennessee Stud\\" is a welcome inclusion (especially relating back to the film), but the last two tracks might make most expecting pure soul just end the disc.  No matter the tracks included are nothing to argue with, except possibly the inclusion of Foxy Brown's \\"Letter To the Firm\\".  As a rap fan, this is a horrible inclusion, it shows up in the movie for like 10 seconds when Max is in the music store (you could have inserted any song here, just a waste). <br /> <br />My only other problem with the soundtrack is that it did not give me everything I wanted or expected.  With the disc only running 51 min. with the skits it really could have been done better.  The Supremes' \\"Baby Love\\" is missing as is Jermaine Jackson's \\"My Touch of Madness\\" (which is pretty hard to get a hold of), and most notably The Delfonics \\"La-La (Means I Love You)\\".  Also, if you have watched the DVD you'll no doubt be trying to figure out the infectious tune played during the menu's: it's The Meter's \\"Cissy Strut\\", also not included.  In addition, none of the music that serves as the score is included here.  Most of these songs were actually composed by the legendary Roy Ayers originally for the \\"Coffy\\" soundtrack (which actually also stars Pam Grier).  I would recommend getting this soundtrack for same score. <br /> <br/>All in all it's a solid soul soundtrack.  It fails in comparison to other soul soundtracks and compilations that I have (Dead Presidents, Chronicles etc.), but I would certainly recommend it for soul fans as well as fans of the film.  If it had included all or most of the films song it would no doubt be a corner stone in anyone's collection.
0790731509|5.0|it goes without saying in my family/friends. they all know my favorite. i watched this movie over 25 times before i found the vhs and bought it. i also have it on cd/avi and dvd. i love the whole movie from opening to ending. i get upset when i ask someone if they have seen this movie and they say: \\"never heard of it\\" i love the entire cast, and each time i view it, it's like the first for me
B0002G2B2M|3.0|type film in the sprit of \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" & \\"Paycheck\\". <br />Jim Carrey is an aquired taste. But both he & Kate Winslet break out of their particular type-cast for this movie. Fine performances as emtionally damaged people who find each other, fall in love, lose each other, fighting for a predestination that they should be together. <br />  Better living through science. There is a machine that destroys brain cells, the relevant brain cells that can eliminate the memory of a relationship you may wish to forget.  <br />There are obvious drawbacks to this procedure, most obvious  being what about the other person? There is a subplot involving Kirsten Dunst & the inventor of this machine played by Tom Wilkinson that is particularily touching & tragic. However, if you like Carrey or Winslet, see this movie, its a bit different.
0060594888|1.0|I must admit a slow read to say the least. The pearls of wisdom claimed by other reviewers are nothing of the sort. What Jack Canfield presents in this textbook sized wisdom writing are 64 principals that are not principals at all but rhetoric regurgitated from a thousand clich&eacute; stories told a thousand different times.  This is a new age book with new age thought I would have thought better could come from the creator of such inspiration as the stories in the Chicken Soup Series.<br /><br /> Jack Canfield has prepared a real disappointment for his audience in this book.  From the visualization techniques to the positive energy mumbo jumbo ones money would be better served to feed the homeless this holiday season.  If you have been one of the unfortunate people to have purchased this book don't lose heart, it will make a great door stop for your imaginary million dollar bath room or your real one for that matter.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Yeah yeah yeah, all this was released before, and yeah yeah yeah, nothing new for real Gn'R fans, and yeah yeah yeah, the band didn't aprove it's release and yeah yeah yeah there are better Gn'R songs out there and many other bad things you can say about this album. None the less, if this is the first record you buy in your life, it's worth 5 stars. The product itself is great. <br />Great songs, Great attitude, amazing music, kick-ass lyrics, great singing, out of this world guitar riffs, awesome bass lines, good drums, all what you can always expect from Gn'R is here. <br />If you wanna know what real rock n' roll music is all about, well, needless to say you gotta get this album. In all honesty Appetite For Destruction is better all along, but none the less, you get a sample of all Gn'R's albums here. The raw and heavy feel of AFD, the feeling of Lies, the art and beauty of the USI I and II, and the attitude of TSI (which I don't know why people bash so much, is one of the most entertaining albums ever), and on top of that you even get a Rolling Stones cover which was never released before on a Gn'R record.  <br />All and All, not bad, could have being millions of times better, they could have even added real unreleased songs like \\"Crash Diet\\" and b-sides like \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" and even live recordings from their \\"Live Era 87-93\\" which would have made this record far more entertaining. None the less, it's a great introduction to Gn'R to new fans, who will be impressed to hear this band at it's \\"best\\"... <br />Highlights: it's Gn'R. <br />Lowlights: nothing new.

Her recipes are easy to follow and most of the required ingredients are easily found in a well stocked supermarket.  If you enjoy good quality food and recipes this is must buy.  The only criticism is that she has repeated a recipe or two from Forever Summer.
0385508417|2.0|This book was mildly amusing.  I'll spare you the details; I'm sure you've seen the commercials for \\"Christmas with the Kranks.\\"  That commercial tells it all without even reading the book.  This is one time when the movie will actually be better than the book.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book because it is not very entertaining and certainly not thought-provoking.  But it's okay if you've been assigned to read a Christmas book for school or a book club.<br /><br />My first John Grisham book in a long time, and I was disappointed.
B000099T2L|5.0|At first, Beyonce' wasn't one of my favorites until I heard her CD. <br />The whole CD was a hit and I really enjoyed every song on it. <br /> <br />The songs: Dangerously In Love <br />        How I Like It <br />        Signs <br />         The Closer I Get To You <br />         Crazy In Love <br />         Baby Boy <br /> <br />These are the best songs on the CD to me. I recommend this CD to any and everyone that likes Beyonce'.  <br /> <br />Actually, I never really knew she could sing that well. Most girls are just jealous of her but I think she's a real success! <br /> <br />Beyonce', Keep up the good work!
