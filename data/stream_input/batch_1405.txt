B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book as a \\"fun\\" break from more serious reading and I will never get those hours back. Many many people have remarked on the tedious and immature writing style so I will try to address other problems I found with the book.  Frankly I'm a bit upset that this book's near constant stream of poorly written and lifeless sex scenes have managed to extinguish any sexiness I found with the BDSM lifestyle. Also not erotic:  the male protagonist needs SERIOUS psychological help and his mental health professional is not doing an adequate job. The fact that this 21 year old was allowing her privacy and free will to be so agregiously breached by his controlling and emotionally abusive behavior was NOT sexy. Whatever your bedroom needs are are your business but his day to day living was dangerous for him and for this pathetic waif that limped through this story.  Bottom line: I am embarrassed I read this and will deny knowledge of this book.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable read. I read all of Grisham's books but have had the feeling that he had gone off the boil a bit of late. Well if that was the case then he is back! He has come up with a polyglot of characters at the centre of which is the endearing David Zinc who, I am sure, will become the alter ego of many who dream of breaking out of the stereotypical corporate life. He is a character that leaves you wanting more and this is why for me the book is one of John Grisham's best stories. At the end of the day, despite the ludicrous nature of mass tort litigation, it is an entertaining plot that will appeal to all the escapists out there!
0679721037|4.0|I find it disturbing that the only nation to ever use a nuclear weapon on another is the US against Japan during WWII.  In this book Hersey tells the stories of six individuals who were in Hiroshima when the bomb was dropped.  He tells their stories and what they went through during this time.  The book is very good, but horrifying, I've never read anything before about what actually happens when an atomic bomb is dropped, the people in this book survived but there are stories about the doctor trying to help people onto a boat only to have their skin slide off, peoples eyes just disintegrate, there are both short term and long term side effects of the radiation poisoning, a hundred thousand people instantly dead, I could go on and on.  Really the whole thing sounds almost too crazy to be true, only to know that it did happen.  The scariest part is the fact that this atomic bomb is relatively weak compared to the ones we have now days.  I truly hope that we'll never see another atomic bomb dropped on another nation.  In any case this book is great.

B0063GORYU|4.0|Good app to have.  I have always loved Spider Solitaire and this game is one of the better apps from Amazon.
B006RUJST6|2.0|I don't know if I'm a tough rater or if everyone else has lower standards than me, but I don't understand all the five star reviews, not only this, but many other books receive.  In my world 5 stars is reserved for books that totally blow me away, that live in my brain for days after I've finished it, with characters I never forget.<br /><br />I can forget the characters in Slammed. What's more, I'm not sure I could name them for you, and I just finished the book last night.  Actually, that's not true.  I can remember Layken, Julia, Will and that's about it.  In my opinion, the characters weren't developed in a way that made me care about them. What's more I felt the story itself pushed my credibility to a point that I had a hard time recovering from.  What mother of an 18 year old high school student pushes her to go out with a 21 year old?  And how does a profession or place where you go to school not come up in a week's worth of conversations and a date (that said mother pushed you to go on)?  And let's not forget the number of kids in this town growing up without parents.  All in all, I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief on these topics enough to buy into the premise.<br /><br />For these reasons alone, I'd have given the book 3 1/2 stars (so rounded up to 4 because we can't give half stars), but I had to go down half a star for the editing errors.  This is a pet peeve of mine, so much so that I highlighted them on my Kindle.<br /><br />At 52%, \\"He wraps his arm around Eddie's waste\\"<br />At 90%, \\"the bottom is open to their waste and legs.\\"<br /><br />Once is a typo, twice, I really think someone doesn't know the difference between waste and waist.  Try this next time.  I let the leftover chocolate cake go to waste so it wouldn't go to my waist.<br /><br />One more thing I do want to mention is that in some other reviews people thought the younger brother acted more like a 5 year old than a 9 year old.  I didn't feel this at all.  9 year old boys ARE immatureand one who suffered the loss of a father less than a year before is going to regress in his behavior.<br /><br />All in all, it was a quick read. It's not something I'll be thinking about again once I post this review, but I certainly don't regret the time spent reading it either.

0739375970|2.0|I got the audio version of this book and have been trying to finish it since it came out 6+ months ago. It is hard work. I keep falling asleep.

I loved the first 3 books, but I don't know if I can take much more of this.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|I have been watching Smash on TV and am very interested in the actors' efforts to capture the essence of Marilyn, which they mostly do by studying movies, imitating her mannerisms and vocal inflections.  I guess that works best for TV.  Marilyn as a person and as a character has been capturing our imagination for more than 60 years.<br /><br />When Michelle Williams walks into the frame, she IS Marilyn.  She seems to have gone beyond the surface to understand the way Marilyn thinks and where she comes from.  Somewhat paradoxically, the result for me is that I stop thinking about whether Michelle Williams is like or unlike Marilyn.  I am instead totally invested in the Marilyn of MW's creation.  She responds instinctively and organically to the adulation of the crowd, to the blustering of Lawrence Olivier, to the besotted adoration of Colin Clark.  She is riveting to watch on her own merits and not because she is playing someone who was an attention magnet.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Even with relatively little to do, Judi Dench, Emma Watson and Julia Ormond distinguish themselves. Kenneth Branagh's Olivier is a little over the top but it works.<br /><br />The whole scenario for making the movie The Prince and the Showgirl is so intriguing.  Colin has a great line where he says that Marilyn is a movie star trying to become a serious actress, while Olivier is a serious actor trying to become a movie star.  That is really the turning point where Colin gains her confidence.<br /><br />This is also a movie about the culture shock of MM going to England with her entourage, but with no one who truly loves her.  Obviously in a week Marilyn and Colin did not develop a deep and lasting love, but they were there for each other to get through the tough time together.<br /><br />I don't think this is a great movie, but it is a very fine movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams.  I will definitely watch it again.
B006MGC3VK|5.0|Great album, still working through the first listens.  Not as heavy as Blood, and a lot more of a Chroma Key feel to these songs, which makes me wonder about Moore's future plans with that project.<br /><br />'Big Chief II' is incredibly catchy, sounds like a re-work of 'No Celebrations' off the Blood bonus EP, though.  Not that this is a bad thing, I loved that track.<br /><br />The album closer, 'Invisible Men', might just be my favorite track they've done to this point.
0545265355|5.0|My son did a tour of Afghanistan, combat up close and personal.  He made it back, the Afghanis he faced did not.  Young kids all.<br /><br />I wish I could have \\"volunteered\\" in my son's place.  I had thought of this before even reading The Hunger Games.<br /><br />That is why the book and movie are so compelling.  And so difficult to think about.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I get that people don't like OpenFeint, however that's not a reason to attack an app.  The permissions used by this game are all reasonable and none of them are remotely fishy.  People need to really calm down about them.  None of the five permissions listed have any possible ill meaning...you'd notice that if you actually thought about it for a few minutes before flipping out.<br /><br />As for the game itself, I had this on my old iPod Touch and it was fantastic.  Randomly generated levels and adjusting difficulty make this one of the best of its kind.

0439023513|4.0|This book was just as good as the first two; I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because some portions of the ending felt a little too abrupt for me (more on that in a minute).  Overall the book was very enjoyable and the characters were just as easy to identify with as ever.  There were many touching moments, particularly with regard to characters that die.  I was very happy, from a literary standpoint, that the author actually did kill off several important characters - it made the story that much more heart-wrenching and realistic; after all, it is unlikely everyone important to Katniss would have survived the war.<br /><br />I found the dynamic between Katniss and the rebel movement to be interesting.  In particular, the dominance of District 13 over it's citizens and the rest of the rebel movement was an interesting commentary on rebel movements and war in general.  It was also an interesting commentary on the changes in war and the media, and in particularly the way the two interact.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am not sure this is really a kid's book.  It's a bit violent (although no more violent than Harry Potter, I suppose), and there are some themes I think might be beyond most younger adolescents.  I am just not sure they can really appreciate some of the deeper issues in the book.<br /><br />My other primary critique is that some portions of the novel, to me, finished a little too abruptly.  Without giving any spoilers away, I felt the tension between Katniss' and the rebel leadership was really unfinished, particularly given that the book never actually answers her questions about which atrocities were perpetrated by which side in the war.  Likewise, while the love story itself is (of course!) resolved, I felt like her relationship with the guy she doesn't pick ended very abruptly; I felt like their relationship really called for a different ending.  I also agree with others that the Epilogue was a bit short; where is Panem now?  Did the revolution \\"stick\\"?  What is life like under the new ruler? None of these questions were adequately answered.<br /><br />All in all an amazing trilogy; definitely one I will be rereading and recommending to others!stick\\"?

0553801473|1.0|Wow. I am a big GRRM fan and I waited years for this?! First of all after all these years you'd think GRRM would offer a brief synopsis to bring the reader back to where, at least some of the main characters are, plot points etc. But no. You spend almost the whole book trying to figure out what is what and who is who with tons of sub plots and minor characters that just end up being confusing and annoying. The result is that the story meanders badly and you don't really care what is happening. It's now predictable that GRRM kills off or sidelines major characters and this book continues that trend with lame characters living on and receiving lavish attention. Again, these types of surprising plot twists, etc are interesting when they happen occasionally but in this book it just means that as a reader I don't really care too much about most of the remaining characters.<br /><br />I guess that I'm still in shock after all these years that this book is so so bad compared to those that came before. It really does seem that GRRM has lost his grip on the overall story, let too many subplots, etc take over. I've gone from a believer that GRRM is the best fantasy writer since Tolkien to wondering if I'll even keep reading this series. I'm sad to write this but it's true. BAD.
0545265355|4.0|I wasn't able to put them down!  I feel that the first book is the most captivating, while the third one left me unsatisfied to some extent.  Due to this, the trilogy only gets 4 stars from me.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|This album is just plain great. It's like a modern psychedelic trip. No song is the same. Anyone who has ever appreciated The Mars Volta will find something special in this record and if you're new to The Mars Volta this might be the record that gets you hooked.

B0076NKNLA|2.0|First off, I tip my hat to Michelle Williams.  She gave a valiant effort in trying to pull off an icon, but she only got it 50% right.  What she DID nail was Marilyn's emotions: vulnerablility, insecurity, brokeness, and need to be loved.  She painted a beautiful picture of wounded woman.  Where she missed the mark big-time was in not nailing the charisma, sex appeal, bombshell MOVIE STAR quality that men were captivated by and women wanted to attain.  Sorry, but Ms. Wiliams, as good of an actress as she is, simply lacks the glamour, punch and va-va-voom flair of an old Hollywood starlet.  This was like casting Anne Hathaway to play Elizabeth Taylor - just wouldn't work.  When playing someone famous, simply being a good actor won't do - you have to have at least *some* of the essence of the person being emulated.  Marilyn was lost in her internal drama a lot of the time, but she knew how turn it on and sell the showgirl image for the cameras.  Williams seemed to just be growing through the motions and looked painfully uncomfortable in any scene where Marilyn had to be \\"on\\".  You get the sense that she's a painfully shy/quiet person and couldn't turn up the personality enough notches to be believable as a 50's movie star.  This is where finding an actress who had a background in musical theater would have made a world of difference.  [No one knows how to \\"sell it\\" better than a Broadway actress!].<br /><br />The poor casting continued with Julia Ormond [laughably] as Vivien Leigh.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING about Ormond's looks and performance remotely resembled the icon america came to know and love as Scarlett O'Hara.<br /><br />The only saving grace acting-wise is Kenneth Branaugh who nailed Sir Lawrence Oliver down to the very last crisply-accentuated syllable.  Well done!  Dougray Scott was pretty good as Arthur Miller, but [sadly] was not in many scenes.<br /><br />Performances aside, the movie was slow, predictable, dull and felt inauthentic.

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|With Cynthia Rothrock considered yesterday's news and the film world over-enamored with Milla Jovovich in her over-produced blockbusters, it really surprises me that a movie like \\"Haywire\\" could still be made under the Hollywood umbrella. Not only is an action movie starring a woman getting the big-name treatment, but it's an action movie starring a genuine fighter and not some stunt-doubled starlet. While most of the professional cage brawlers who've made it to the film world have had to slug it out in some remarkably bad low-budget fare (e.g. [[ASIN:B001RLW9Y6 Never Surrender]]), MMA heroine Gina Carano lucks out with a great director and a surprisingly good cast in a pretty satisfying CIA revenge flick that could easily become the foundation of a very promising career.<br /><br />The story: black ops operative Mallory Kane (Carano, who had a bit part in [[ASIN:B002FU8JTW Blood & Bone]]) embarks on an intercontinental mission to find out why she was betrayed by her allies...<br /><br />I can easily see why the general, non- action-oriented public might not like this movie. Director Steven Soderbergh is definitely one of contemporary Hollywood's best, and because this isn't [[ASIN:B000067IZ3 Traffic]], people who aren't in it for the punches and kicks might consider it a step down for him. Additionally, even I was surprised by this one's cast: I would have expected to find Channing Tatum ([[ASIN:B002E01LL6 Fighting]]), but Antonio Banderas ([[ASIN:0800130448 Desperado]]), Ewan McGregor ([[ASIN:B0057ZAA6W Trainspotting]]), and Michael friggin' Douglas ([[ASIN:B00003CXDB Wall Street]])? It's as though Steven Soderbergh called in some favors and bets he won... Truthfully, some of these big names aren't necessary to the film - Michael Douglas' role as a CIA director could've easily been played by someone else - so again, some viewers who will watch this film for name recognition are chancing disappointment when these big stars end up not doing too much. With that said, everybody generally does well and you have to hand it to star Gina Carano for making the most of her first major role: even when not kicking butt, her dramatic offering is more than acceptable.<br /><br />Of course, the main reason I saw the film was for the butt-kicking, and I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. Mixed martial arts movies contradict my belief that the best fight scenes are produced by low-budget fare where choreographical creativity can be embellished and not stifled by the whims of producers: while the majority of direct-to-video MMA movies have featured truly awful fight scenes, Hollywood seems to have a better bead on how to make the most of \\"realistic\\" fighting, and \\"Haywire\\" is a great example. Carano has six fights of varying lengths throughout the film, and to say that she uses them to redefine how powerful a woman can appear onscreen is an understatement. Even though I like only four of these brawls (which include a standup battle against Ewan McGregor of all people), they're good enough to make me reconsider the place of mixed martial arts in movies. The fights are, for the most part, well-shot and Carano displays the same sort of brutal efficiency as in her Strikeforce career, though she's not above the occasional flashy move like a rebounding roundhouse off the wall. When it comes to looking like she really means it but still being entertaining, Gina's got few equals.<br /><br />The production is strong, which should be a given in a Soderbergh movie. Some of the European scenes are shot on location, others are fudged, but it all looks authentic. The film doesn't try to do anything aesthetically new, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't need to: unless you're particularly needy of car chases and explosions, this movie delivers what an action picture should and does it with a complete lack of pretense. My only major qualm? - the ending comes from out of nowhere and bit too soon for my taste, but I can live with this. Definitelyworth a watch, and probably even a buy.worth a watch, and probably even a buy.
B0078N2MTE|4.0|I tried to get this video at block buster but none of the stores carried it in stock, so I spent a couple dollars and viewed it on Instant Video at Amazon. It was well worth the money.<br /><br />The story is essentially about CURTIS (Michael Shannon) a father husband, and  worker in a small mid-western  town that is experiencing nightmares, visions, and is hearing things concerning some major disaster in the future. These experiences go to the extent of disrupting almost every facet of his life. His mother was a schizophrenic but he feels compelled to follow after these visions, all the while worrying whether he will lose everything and be committed to a hospital.<br /><br />I know some schizophrenics in my life and I felt that Michael Shannon's acting was spot on as far as depicting CURTIS (the main character of the story). It seems like Shannon never looks at the camera and often looks off into the distance when speaking to other characters. When Curtis speaks, it is in small chunks, as most schizophrenics communicate. He also portrays the emotional blunting effect of schizophrenia well.  All of this impressed me that he had educated himself about schizophrenics. Only in the town hall dinner scene, does Curtis really come out of his shell in an emotional explosion.<br /><br />Curtis's wife, SAMANTHA, is played by Jessica Chastain. The role is of a fairly stereo typical mid-western house wife and mother; but Chastain brings life to it and I could not help but like the character and respect choices when it came to her husband and child.<br /><br />The cinematography adds flavor to the movie of a sort of impending  doom, either for the character or the small town.  The colors are muted except for in a few scenes. The special effects are believable and just enough to add to the story and not overwhelm it.<br /><br />All in all this was a good movie, the twists and turns the movie takes keep the interest going until the end where we find out whether Curtis is crazy orsomehow a prophet.

1451683405|5.0|\\"Free Will\\" Thoughts, sometimes before fully reading:<br />Observing the 'outside' universe tells me there is no \\"soul\\" that is independent of the laws of cause and effect. But it seems otherwise as long as I can't fully observe my past genetic, environmental and cultural programming, or the \\"real\\" future. I am somewhat a proxy between past and the real future. In that sense, I could say the present \\"I\\" have free will.<br /><br />The common view seems to be that \\"I\\" am the one who observes and makes decisions. Now, studies of the brain show that some decisions are made, even acted upon, before they appear to the conscious mind. In that case, I prefer to define \\"I\\" as the one that makes decisions.<br /><br />It's apparent that perception of events reach my eyes and other senses after they happen. Likewise, they reach \\"me\\", my quick-decison-making mind, later, and my concious mind later still. Many decisions are made over longer periods, so my conscious mind is able to also participate in them. (The \\"mind\\" is difficult to locate within the brain, sometimes defined as a verb, what the brain 'does', and the \\"subconscious\\" mind is based on more primitive and simple processes, therefore faster to act.)<br /><br />The story about the Indian yogi who says, and believes, he can live on light and doesn't need to eat brings to mind that he could have \\"multiple personalities\\" (multiple conscious minds) and the 'other' mind is eating in his \\"absence\\".

B004UXUX4Q|2.0|After suffering through 2 hours of my life that I will never get back by seeing \\"The American,\\" I'm nervous to give a Geroge Clooney movie, even one nomianted for an Oscar, a fair chance. Will probably just wait until it comes out on HBO or something.I'll give it two stars because it can't possibly be as awful as The American was. But I havent seen it yet and am nervous about buying, or even renting it.

B005KELQEU|4.0|We were recently given a Kindle as a gift and wanted to protect it from accidental damage and unnecessary wear and tear.  The question was whether or not to get a \\"sleeve\\" case or a \\"book cover\\" type of case.  Because we prefer holding the Kindle itself, we opted to purchase the Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Case.  The relatively low price was very attractive when compared to other products that we considered.<br /><br />This is a well designed, functional product, manufactured to a good quality level.  The cover material is attractive and looks as though it will wear well.  The foam padding provides good protection without making the product bulky.  The zippers work in both directions and appear to be of high quality.  Very nicely put together product which I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />The only thing that I wish they had was some type of inside flap when a business card or note card could be stored.  Otherwise, any paper item kept inside the portfolio tends to fall out when the Kindle is removed.  Not a big deal, just a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />The only caveat I have to buying this case is your personal feelings about having a light for your Kindle for those times when you are reading in dim or have no light whatsoever.  This portfolio doesn't provide that capability.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|It'd be difficult to approach Wrath of the Titans with a completely open mind. The film it follows, Clash of the Titans, was dull and almost single-handedly began the downfall of 3D in the US. Those low expectations though may actually be an advantage for Wrath. Though flawed it's an entertaining film with some spectacular special effects. Even more surprising - the 3D is worthwhile and enhances the experience.<br /><br />The story follows Perseus (Sam Worthington) who must travel into the underworld to rescue his father Zeus (Liam Neeson). Zeus' other son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) has turned on him and handed him over to Hades (Ralph Fiennes). The plan is to sap Zeus' powers and transfer them to the leader of the imprisoned Titans - Kronos - (father to Zeus, Hades, and Poseiden) who would then unleash hell on the world.<br /><br />Where the negativity towards Clash really makes an impact is in the early minutes of Wrath. There is no real emotional attachment to the characters - no real care for their fates or the conflicts that are at hand. I wasn't sure the film would be able to break out of that but it somehow did despite inherent confusion around their relationships and motivations without having Clash's plot fresh on the mind. It just took a little time for it to come together.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans isn't going to win any awards for dialogue which is sketchy to say the least and almost laughable at times. In fact the movie tends to just move from one set piece to the next with the story taking a back seat. The action is what ties it all together and ultimately leads into a massive final battle. It was actually somewhat startling just was how brisk the pace was and how quickly events advanced - by the time that battle came around it didn't feel as though it was already time for the film to be concluded.<br /><br />That is a compliment as the first film was plodding and anything but an enjoyable experience. The effects in Wrath are extraordinary and the uniqueness of the various monsters, and the sheer size of Kronos, adds to the fun. While I rarely would recommend paying extra for 3D - and I still wouldn't necessarily with Wrath - there were some really cool moments that were taken advantage of with the technology and it added some valuable depth to scenes. All things being equal going with the 3D wouldn't be a bad decision here.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans achieved something unanticipated - it entertained and even made the prospect of a third film in the series somewhat appealing. Expectations, albeit very low, were easily exceeded. There are better overall options in theaters right now (21 Jump Street, The Hunger Games) but for the crowd seeking action Wrath of the Titans is worth considering.eness of the various monsters, and the sheer size of Kronos, adds to the fun.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I first heard about the trilogy, I wasn't sure about it, I heard it compared as \\"twilight on steroids\\", but without the vampire/werewolf bit. I started reading the sample, and IMMEDIATELY bought it after finishing. It was so intriguing and I could NOT stop reading!! It's not overly gushy (like twilight) and has romance in the right places. (wish there were more Christian Greys in the world!!)  I know since I finished the first book yesterday, and also got the sample of the second today that it MUST be good as well, so I am no an official advocate of the entire series! E.L. James had a good thing going while writing this book, and I can't wait to continue the series and keep reading!<br />It's worth it people! :)

B003EYVXV4|4.0|This PG-13 movie, based on the best-selling Young Adult novel by Suzanne Collins, describes a not-too-distant future when teenagers selected by lottery are sent to an isolated area to fight to the death on live television. The last one standing will enjoy freedom from hunger for his or her loved ones. To me, this theme is absolutely off-putting, but the book itself isn't as bloody or as sensational as I had feared. Whew!<br /><br />My favorite part is how they skewer Reality Shows! Stanley Tucci is absolutely spot on as the master of ceremonies: complete with fluffed hair, ridiculous makeup, phony smile and over-the-top enthusiasm.<br /><br />Based on this first one's phenominal success, a franchise is in the works for these actors:<br />  * Jennifer Lawrence (\\"Like Crazy\\") as Katniss, our resourceful heroine, already familiar with survival skills because that's how she keeps food on the table for her widowed mother and frail little sister.<br />  * Josh Hutcherson (\\"The Kids are All Right\\") as Peeta, one side of what will be an eternal triangle; the two masculine sides are very different, but each appealing in his own way. This sweet young baker slips our heroine an occasional loaf of burnt bread for her hungry family and has packed a torch for her most of their lives.<br />  * Liam Hemsworth (\\"The Last Song\\") is Gale, an outdoorsy guy, handsome, kind, and very much in love with our heroine; he looks out for her mother and sister when she leaves.<br />  * Willow Shields (TV) is Primrose, that frail sister whose name is drawn in the lottery. Her big sister Katniss leaps to her defense and volunteers to take her place.<br />  * Woody Harrelson (\\"Rampart\\") is Haymitch, the only previous winner from District 12. He's a drunk and is supposed to mentor our two teenagers. He knows they must land some sponsors in order to get much-needed emergency supplies during the games.<br />  * Lenny Kravitz (\\"Precious\\") is Cinna, the creative genius who designs our heroine's \\"Dress of Fire.\\" His kindness offers the first glimmer of hope our heroine can see.<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"Margin Call\\") is Flickerman, that annoying, insincere master-of-ceremonies.<br />  * Donald Sutherland (\\"Horrible Bosses\\") is President of Panem, the dystopian country created by a global conflict. He is irked by the games and is cooking up some new trouble for our star-crossed characters in the sequel.<br /><br />Director Gary Ross (\\"Seabiscuit\\") is a terrific director. I lost my way a couple of times (maybe I don't remember the book correctly), but this film kept me involved every minute. In keeping with her persona, our heroine rarely smiles, is intense, focused, and clearly uncomfortable during her public appearances. Her forced smile is perfect and she does 95% of this film without a trace of makeup. She doesn't stumble in the woods, automatically comes to the rescue of others, and is a crack shot with a bow and arrow.<br /><br />What a welcome change from the self-centered, foul-mouthed floozies who prance across our modern silver screens. Here is a heroine worthy of admiration for today's teenagers! Amazon.com will notify me when this is available.

B001N3OJEG|5.0|My favorite book is The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. Just the mystery aspect taking place during the 30s in Los Angeles is fantastic, not to mention the thrilling suspense that makes you want to keep reading. That's exactly what LA Confidential was like, with just a bit less suspense and taking place in the 50s. This movie was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won 2 of them. I highly recommend that you watch it.

If you google for \\"Game Of Thrones BluRay problems\\" you will find a forum where many people already are complaining about this. There are also other players mentioned who have problems with this set, even PS3! The news has already reached Sony and they want to take a closer look at this problem. Just wanted to warn those people who may want to buy this set, they should check if there BluRay player may have problems with this set.<br /><br />The show itself is one of the best I have encountered in years.

B00792EGES|5.0|Someone ought to explain to me why anyone would buy the Audio CD seperately when this Blu-ray / CD combo seems to be the DEAL of a lifetime. Every AB fans dream. Great show, great production quality both in HD Video and HD Audio. Deserves every star.<br />However, I too feel that Myles cursing was unnecessary. Let me explain. I'm an adult, so the expletives don't bother me personally, but my two young boys are also evolving into AB fans. At ages 9 and 10 they like to sing \\"Wonderful Life and Watch Over You\\" as I play those songs on my Acoustic and together we have watched the Amsterdam Show many many times. Now, I contemplate letting them see this entire Blu-ray as is, or perhaps just letting them watch (edited) portions. I'm glad Myles acoustic portion is curse-free!<br />So note to AB: Fellas, your fans come in all AGES. As (under-valued and under-appreciated) artists your music is far reaching and widely enjoyed. Be proud of that, but mindful as well.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond's 1998 Pulitzer Prize winning popular science book presents, in some circles, a controversial theme or even racist explanation for the differences in the development of societies over time. However, the author states early on \\"the modern world's inequalities: why did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? Those disparate rates constitute history's broadest pattern and my books subject.\\" In addition, to counter the racist's question he states \\"History follows different courses for different people because of differences in environments, not because of biological difference\\"<br /><br />He proceeds in a well written logical progression to explain this thesis throughout the book starting with spread of humans around the world and the beginnings of civilization and the various rates at which they have developed. He proceeds to explain that there are four sets of factors which have caused the unequal speed and development of civilizations between the various continents. They are:<br /><br />1. Differences in the wild plants and animal species available for domestication.<br /><br />2. Factors affecting the rates of human diffusion and migration which differed greatly among continents.<br /><br />3. Diffusion between continents, which may also help build up and spread these domesticates and technology.<br /><br />4.  Continental differences in area or total population size which with a larger area or population gives that society more opportunity to develop.<br /><br />Which brings us to his main conclusion: \\"All human societies contain inventive people which speeds development. It's just that some environments provide more starting material and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions, than do other environments.\\"<br /><br />You will not find footnotes in this book because it is popular science and not a scientific treatise. However, at the back of the book, you will find a well-organized Further Reading section if you want to dig into more detail of his presentation and concepts.<br /><br />Overall, the book presented well the themes, concepts and overall conclusions, which I had thought for years, to be the reasons for the differences in societies.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Spoiler Alert - Candid Review:<br /><br />I read so much about this book, about it being a different take on the Bella/Edward story. Well, it was different for sure but nowhere as good as Twilight. Firstly, the heroine's chastity is too unbelievable for today's USA, especially since she's a babe (according to lots of people in the book). Frankly, Ana's repetitive musings about her inner goddess / her subconscious are irritating. And the writing was so amateurish.<br /><br />The hero just didn't do it for me, even though she keeps talking about how hot he is. He just didn't resonate with me - not like Edward. Once again, it's a story of abuse leaving someone stunted in the emotional department - which has been written with much better results in many other books. And I mean MANY books - to start with, many stories from JR Ward have been written with abused heroes which actually touch your heart - Zsadist, Vishous, Rehvenge, John Matthew...<br /><br />I didn't have that many issues with the sex - but I doubt that the Dom/sub relationship is as tame as the writer writes like in her book...<br /><br />Anyway, quite a let down, but I might read the next book just to see what happens to them. At the end of the day, I guess you can call that a success if someone wants to know how the story goes on...

B004J4WLB4|4.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" is one of the saddest books I've read in quite a while. It is written beautifully, but beware, it's a very depressing tale of a girl abandoned by her parents at birth. The main character is self distructive and along the way, comes close to destroying the lives of those who come to love her. Although the author writes beautifully, her technique of moving back and forth in time, can be distracting and disrupts the flow of the characters' lives and relationships. This is a touching story that left me teary eyed at times and is a clear commentary on the needs of children whose parents leave them to fend for themselves in a system that is heartless and uncaring. If you want a little cry, read this book.

0439023513|1.0|I devoured the first two books of the series, but this one was so hard to get into. Other reviewers have laid out the many issues of this book, so I'll be brief as to not be repetitious. Too many new characters that only existed to be killed off, too little of the characters I loved (Peeta and Haymitch), and way too many scenes of Katniss passing out and ducking into closets/alcoves. I wasn't expected a happy ending, considering the nature of the books, but this was just downright depressing. I haven't been this bitterly disappointed in a book in a very long time.
055358894X|1.0|After I got to the point where one character was pretending to strangle another character for about 5 pages where they kept jumping back and forth between the present and the past without giving much indication that they were doing so, I put the book down and have had no desire to pick it back up.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this was an okay book. It was not the best book but it comes in second in my ratings of the series. I was expecting something way different.
074356619X|5.0|I've read many of the negative and cynical comments posted and just shook my head. I am not a self-help junkie by any means, but I bought the book, let it sit and thought nothing more of it. As a realtor, times were tough in 2010. We were about dead broke, my income dropped over 75% in a year, and I saw no light at the end of the tunnel. We had been served with foreclosure papers, and I couldn't get a job to save my life, despite numerous attempts and interviews and an extensive background in the paralegal field. One day, I remembered I had this book. I was too depressed to even read it. A few more weeks went by and I kept thinking of it but something always stopped me from picking it up. Finally I did, and I read it in one sitting. I began by going to the website and printing off a Universal Bank blank check and filled in $100,000. Then I began practicing what I learned, and it wasn't easy to train my brain to quit with the negative and shift into what has become my daily internal chant, I have an abundance of money, health and happiness. The shift from \\"they won't buy a house\\" turned into \\"they will buy a house\\". Everytime I have quiet time, be it when I'm driving (I turn off the radio now) or home with no one around, I repeat that mantra over and over and I tell the \\"Universe\\" what I want. It may sound corny, but it WORKS. In 2011, our tax returned showed income of over $120,000 and for the first time ever, I made more than my husband. Then sales started to slow down again, funny how quickly we forget. I realized I had gotten away from practicing what I learned and began doing it again. The phone started ringing again, ideas came to me that I hadn't thought of before, and once again, sales were on the rise. So to you people on the fence, please don't listen to the people who are so quick to criticize; I am an average person with an average life and from the bottom of my heart, I truly believe the things I learned from this book saved us from foreclosure, allowedme to open a savings account and has been nothing short of a Godsend. It's not easy to train your mind to think differently and it's always a struggle, but with time, it does get easier. I think I get my best practice in the car when I'm alone. I've been asked by various realtor friends what I'm doing that caused my business to increase and I have to say I hesitate to tell them because I don't want them to think I\\"m loony, so when they say it's been a closely guarded secret for centuries, I believe it and I understand why. I don't think it's necessarily out of greed, I think it's because people are skeptical and quick to judge. But I felt compelled to share this because if just one person decides to try it and their life changes like mine did, then I have passed the secret on just like Rhonda did. She's not a manipulator, she knows what she's talking about. And give it time, it won't be instantaneous and you may not even realize it's all coming together until you sit back one day and think, wait a minute, things have gradually started to improve... could it be?? Yes, it is. Good luck to everyone and keep an open mind!

B005EGXTEE|4.0|I downloaded it and found it a gripping read, only to discover at the end that I had been foolish enough to buy the first of a trilogy. It leaves the story up in the air in a most unsatisfactory way. Do I want to go through any more of this I ask myself. The answer is no. Wikipedia has supplied me with the plot of the other two and I do not believe it is worth putting myself through what looks to be a most dismal outcome.<br /><br />Second thoughts on this: I did continue with the other two and by the end came to appreciate what the author was doing. It is violent, certainly, but in spite of that I was glad to have finished the story and the ending made the whole thing worth while. The three books have been read by my eleven and 13 year old grand daughters. I need to read what they are reading. I would say the themes are self sacrifice, courage in the face of incredible odds and wisdom to see the bigger picture. Our heroine has maturity well beyond her years. In the end it is a political novel .
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I recently watched the help for the first time. What a well written and wonderfully acted film. Makes you wish you were alive at this time, to help and support the black community.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I had known this book centered around sexual domination for gratification, use of S&M toys and bondage by contract.  I'm about half way through and since there does not appear to have any other story line, I'm not going to finish.  I could have had a V8 and enjoyed it more. Definitely not a book for teen girls.  Its not a book for any book club to read (unless its the flavor-of-the-month reading topic).
B004N7WJF0|4.0|Sometime during the 1990's, German heavy metal icons the Scorpions, seemed to have lost their enthusiasm for the genre.  Their album Face The Heat, released in 1993 was probably their last that was in the traditional heavy metal vein.  Subsequent albums [[ASIN:B000002JA5 Pure Instinct]] (1996) and [[ASIN:B00000J8NQ Eye II Eye]] (1999) reflected a change in style.  Although \\"You And I\\" from Pure Instinct is featured in the Acoustica performance, these albums have come to be largely ignored by the band.<br /><br />Still trying to find their way, in 2000 the band embarked on a project with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and conductor Christian Kolonovits, that eventually became [[ASIN:B0000584ZL The Scorpions - Moment of Glory (Live with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra)]] (2000), an event released on both CD and DVD.  Acoustica is a continuation of the band's excursion down an alternate musical path, as the Scorps are basically playing unplugged, taking part in a trend that had been quite popular during the 90's.  Christian Kolonovits again joins the band for this project, playing keyboards.  Other additional musicians include Johan Daansen on guitar, and Ariana Arcu on cello.<br /><br />Acoustica was recorded in Lisbon, Portugal, and features Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs playing acoustic guitars.  Bass player Ralph Rieckermann, and drummer James Kottak, play their normal instruments.  While in an unusual situation, vocalist Klaus Meine is backed by three female singers.  The 21 song setlist includes classic Scorpions songs, cover tunes, and some brand new material.  The band put in a lot of effort into the performance, selecting the songs, writing new songs, developing the musical arrangements for acoustic instruments, and incorporating the other musicians into the project.<br /><br />In general, the results are very good, as the \\"unplugged\\" approach typically brings a fresh new appreciation for material normally featuring distorted electric guitars played at extreme volume.  The arrangement for \\"Catch Your Train\\" for example, gives the song a whole new vibe.  Almost everything sounds terrific, and the band is having a great time in a new musical arena.  Guitarists, Jabs and Schenker, probably have to make the biggest adjustment, and they handle the transition to acoustic quite smoothly.  Softer numbers like \\"Send Me An Angel\\", \\"Under the Same Sun\\", \\"You And I\\", and \\"Still Loving You\\", probably sound the closest to the studio versions, while \\"Holiday\\" is given a Latin feel.  Rockers like \\"Rhythm of Love\\", \\"The Zoo\\", \\"Loving You Sunday Morning\\", and a jazzy version of \\"Tease Me, Please Me\\", might sound the most interesting unplugged.  For \\"The Zoo\\" and \\"Tease Me, Please Me\\", a number of female dancers also join the proceedings.<br /><br />The new material generally works well in the acoustic format, and includes the songs \\"I Wanted To Cry\\", \\"Life Is Too Short\\", and \\"Back To You\\".  \\"When Love Kills Love\\", appears to be the most popular of the new songs.  The band is to be complemented for taking risks, but they do not fare quite as well on some of the cover tunes.  The tempo of \\"Dust In the Wind\\" is a little too brisk, and while Klaus Meine is unquestionably a great singer, he doesn't have quite the right voice for the song.  Likewise, he lacks the subtly to handle the Cars' \\"Drive\\".<br /><br />The production of Acoustica is first class, and features very good image quality and a number of audio options.  The square shaped stage is quite spacious, and provides some atypical views of the musicians.  Camera coverage of the band is pretty good, and includes feeds from mobile cameras suspended over the audience.  Editing is a little fast, but there are a lot of people on stage, and the cutting is mostly sensible and not too annoying.  Probably by design, the front rows of the audience seem to consist mostly of young women.  While the Acoustica DVD contains 21 songs, the audio CD release contains only 15 songs.

030788743X|5.0|I was interested in this book from the beginning, but it took me a long time to get around to reading it. I wish I had purchased it the day it had come out, because by now, I could have reread it a few more times. Simply said, the book was fabulous. The idea that society could exist within a virtual reality game doesn't seem so outrageous the way Cline writes it. His reverence for the pop culture from the 1980s is charming and the inclusion of those references didn't seem gratuitous. They added to the storyline and gave the characters more depth. I couldn't help but be invested in the lives of Wade (or Parczival), H, Artemis, Shoto, or Dioto. I couldn't stop reading and wanted to find out what happened, but I was sad to see it end. I'm anxious to see if the movie, with Cline signed on as a screen writer, will do this book justice. I can't recommend this book enough.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Bought this to put in my gaming rig, temps are stupid low. Right now core temp says 15C, cpuid says cpu 28C, gaming temp is around 34c. I will never build another game box without one of these. Of course I had to take the motherboard out to put this in. This is in an ASUS M4A785M, 960T AMD 4 cores{unlocked to 6} oc'ed to 3.7, 8gigs,evga video card  and 4 cases fans in my raidmax case. Make sure your case is wide enough, one my case fans, I had to put it on the outside of the case, the cooler is so tall its less than half an inch from the glass side, again make sure its going to fit, measure. For the price this is one of the greatest coolers ever. You need it get one! Delivery was quick, as usual. Thanks Amazon and Cooler Master.

0143119680|5.0|If I had read these reviews, I would never have picked up this book.  I saw it in the store and thought the description was interesting.  I don't read romance novels, and have never touched the Twilight series (glittering vampires are too much for me).  I loved the Harry Potter series, and Dean Koontz, Dan Brown, Christopher Moore & Terry Pratchet are among my favorite authors.<br /><br />This book was still a page-turner, but lighter than my normal fare.  The romance was a nice change of pace and a wonderful read!  I loved it and have already pre-ordered the second!
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|It would be nice if developers would stop putting this in their games. It ruins the experience of games that have a chance of being good.
B003VYAX2W|4.0|This CD really is good and 'fresh'. Excellent, riff driven Metal Rockabilly with swagger AND punch! Some of the heavier moments make this CD a little dark, but overall it is filled with some very radio friendly choruses, contagious Guitar riffs, good clean Vocals and a lot of attitude. It is very accessible yet not weak in any way.<br />Try to get the chorus of 'Heaven Nor Hell' or 'Fallen' out of your head. Good luck! In fact most of the songs are very memorable and fun with interesting lyrics to suit the music underneath.<br /><br />Think 1 part Danzig mixed with 1 part White Zombie and 2 parts Stray Cats (yes, that 80's rockabilly group)! Thats the best I can come up with. It really is a cool CD and I will go back and check out their prior stuff now. Something tells me I will like it. I mean who knew a band from overseas could sound like a dirty, NY garage band?<br /><br />It does not get a 5 because as good as it is it is not the most original songwriting. Some of the songs sound like traces of things you may have heard before, just not in this way. Some of the choruses are VERY radio Friendly, maybe a little to hook driven, but most will LOVE this about this CD. And for the most part I do as well, I just find a few of the choruses 'overhooked' (if that is even a word).<br /><br />BUT, some of the heavier stuff balances this CD out well and there are 13 tracks, so if you dont LOVE a couple, its still well worth the money. Its a cool band with a unique style. One of the better releases of 2010 and I am very glad I took a chance with it. If something 'different' yet comfortable sound good to you, this is it. Very fresh and has something for everyone.

B000002LGQ|3.0|At this point in her career, Madonna had quite a few hits under the belt but the critics still weren't convinced! So with this record we saw a much more concentrated effort on Madonnas part not just to dominate the pop field, but also to display her mind and emotions...she more than sheds the superficial party girl routine she adopted for her earlier records. Madonna has always made it a sport in her music of simply being rowdy and breaking some rules here and there, and who is to say what is and isn't socially acceptable? We all know of course of the religious importance of the name Madonna, combine that with the video of burning crosses and her kissing a black jesus, and did i even mention the actual song? It's a complete double entendre, as it doubles about finding god or a sexual experience! And you thought Like a Virgin was risque! And she was just getting started, as her next record would attest. But not to worry, Madonna is still all about having a good time and that's what pop is about, right? Cherish and Keep It Together are simply two of the most easy going and positive songs she's ever recorded, and only one with a hard of stone could resist..the latter seemingly all about the love and respect and appreciation one must have in regards to family. Dear Jessie is a bit of an interesting oddity, as it is simply a pop lullaby to Madonnas niece, and features a video that might cross into the so bad/creepy its good. Love Song is a duet with Madonna alongside none other than Prince, and she more than holds her own...cooing seductively while still keeping it classy. However, this record isn't without a few spotty moments. Oh Father simply drags on and on to the point of sheer torture, and though the sentiment in till death do us part is sweet...it could afford to be a bit less self indulgent and shorter as well. The closing track is a total head scratcher, but could point to madonna having some..contempt for organized religion? Who would have thought?
B00701QVVY|5.0|...And they were fulfilled! This album kicks you in the balls from start to finish. Just like 'Ironbound' This album pretty gives you the Overall idea of what Overkill is all about. The boys took the world by electrical storm with this release. When the title of the album has the word 'Electric' in it, its definitely the right definition for such a monster like this one. Everything on this album screams speed and power. Bobby Blitz sounds better than ever, D.D Verni is still shaking the world with his irresistible Bass, Dave Linsk is shredding as usual, and Derek Tailor is providing his tight rhythm to go along with Dave's, and Ron Lipnicki is getting the job done and showing some modern day drummers how it's done. This Album is nothing short of pure gold. Here's my opinions on the songs.<br /><br />Come And Get It: Nice opener and what you would expect from Overkill. The fast Thrashy riffs with tasteful drumming to go along with it. What could be better? During the middle of the song, it gets a bit heavier, taking on the same kind of formula of 'The Green And Black' from the previous album, but of course being a song on its own. The backing vocals are almost Accept like during this part. All around great song.<br /><br />Electric Rattlesnake: Again, another song you would expect from Overkill. Nice riffs and maneuvers quite nicely. The Chorus when Blitz screams \\"ELECTRIC RATTLE SNAKE!\\"  takes you back to albums such as The Years Of Decay or even as far back as Taking Over. Bobby is on top of his game for this one.<br /><br />Wish You Were Dead: First thing I got to say is, that scream at the beginning is INSANE! At age 52, I find that to be astonishing. Bobby also sings like he did in the late 80's and early 90's. Something I could see on maybe Horrorscope. It sounds like a mix between Horrorscope and Ironbound and it's a nice mix.<br /><br />Black Daze: If your head ain't bobbing to this song, you have some major issues. This is one of those songs you have in thecar blasting at intense volumes while headbanging. This song Grooves like no other. Just about everything about this song is heavy. That's about the best way I can explain this monster of a song. One of my favorites off this album by far.<br /><br />Save Yourself: This song when it starts out kind of reminds me of songs like Killing For A Living and Bring Me The Night from 'Ironbound'. Very awesome modern day Overkill song that is about the same pace throughout the whole song. It almost has a Punk vibe in there too, and for any huge Overkill fan, you know that Punk is huge with Overkill.<br /><br />Drop The Hammer Down: This song is one of my favorites off this album as well. It basically speaks for itself. This song will literally 'Drop The Hammer Down' on you. The riffs are really tight and this shows the band at the top of their game. This would be a great song to use in the setlist live that the crowd could very well participate, but don't you worry, it's got plenty of speed, aggression, and everything any Thrash or Metal fan for that matter, look for in a song.<br /><br />21st Century: This is carrying on the theme of just the in your face and balls out Thrash that takes you on a ride. The Chorus is really catchy and groovy with the backing vocals being hard-hitting as usual that has been present in Overkill's music for their entire career. Another Modern day Overkill song that shows how much they progressed in the past decade. Definitely worth a listen.<br /><br />Old Wounds, New Scars: I could see this song being on Horrorscope. That Chorus has a really cool lyric line \\"Got a lot of mouth for a Jersey white boy\\" and is something I could see Overkill writing in their youth. This indeed revisits the Old school Overkill that we all know and love. The title basically describes this song. Old wounds coming back and creating new scars for such a great album that is new and fresh.<br /><br />All Over But The Shouting: Another song that I can see being an Old SchoolOverkill tune. This song would fit right in on The Years Of Decay. The first thing I thought when this song came on was 'Birth Of Tension' Not that it sounds anything like it, but it takes the same approach in songwriting and gives you that feeling of Tension. The riff after the second Chorus reminds of a riff that could fit in 'Nothing To Die For'. Don't get me wrong, Overkill is definitely on a whole different level on this record but you can tell they have an awareness of where they came from.<br /><br />Good Night: Honestly, this is probably my most favorite on the album. This is the epitome of what metal should be. Creepy and awesome intro, fast and speed riffs, Catchy bridge and tight musicianship. This shows Overkill at their utmost potential in my opinion. This also can be another Old School like tune but keeping that Modern day Overkill sound present. I could have not picked a better closer for such a great album.<br /><br />Bottom line, this shows Overkill doing what they do best and that is showing everyone that you don't have to sacrifice your sound to get a great sounding album out. They are waving the flag for many bands to follow in their footsteps and they are showing no signs of stopping anytime soon. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Even if you're just getting into them, this honestly would not be a bad place to start. This has a mixture of everything you would need to look for in order to get what these guys are about. I guarantee you won't regret buying it.
B000002KKC|5.0|this album is regarded in many circles as a coke pop masterpiece, and of course i am referring to the drink. it is every bit as lovely as rumors, only this time more vulnerable...more human...more multifaceted. this was the last true passionate moment in the bands recording history. after rumors which was obviously a mega smash, they were giving free reign and a gigantic budget, and the creative freedom to really do something interesting. And they had the confidence to go all the way. This album didn't do the numbers of it's predecessor, and with that in combination to the escalating drama behind the scenes of the band, they lost a bit of the magic touch. They didn't start replicating ideas and song structures until the mirage/tango in the night days. sisters of the moon must be heard to be believed...it seems to be about stevie nicks initiation into something occult and dark...bringing out the best of her witchy wonder.

B000006MS3|5.0|Kate Bush ditches the soaring balladry of her past and instead reaches inside herself and rips from her core a wave of 80's synth drenched feminist rage! In no way is this a gentle listen, it is Kate at her most dark, insecure, and questioning of everything around her. Those that even know of Kate Bush at all have a image of her as someone dainty and quiet, and the beauty of this record is her willingness to warp her voice and sound to come across ugly or barbaric, for the sake of her art. surely she is straining her voice on houdini and pull out a pin, but it's very punk rock, shall we say? The subtlety of the lyrics and the inspiration she seemed to draw from adds another layer to the brilliance of the record. You won't find any easy going piano ballads on this record, it's all straight up anger and pented up agression, be it sexual or political, even dashed with a hint of mysticism! The record was, no surprise, a bit of a commercial failure in comparison to her earlier releases which might explain the softness of her next record, the hounds of love.
0307352145|2.0|I wanted to like this book. I saw Cain's TED talk and was impressed. Unfortunately that's where my interest ended. I read most of Quiet, but there were so many parts I found unbearable--I plodded through the Warren Buffet chapter and finally gave up.<br /> I read Aron's HSP well before this, which Cain references lots, and I think that's a much more informative book.<br />I know that Cain poured her heart into this. Still, that doesn't change my regret for shelling out $25 for a book that I thought would be an introvert's bible. Perhaps this book is suited for those unfamiliar with the MBTI. My internet searches on the MBTI were more informative than this book. At least it's readable . . .
B006ZT47O0|4.0|First of all...Simone's voice. Wow. In this release, we hear more mid-range than high notes...and Simone's voice has never sounded better! Is there any style in which she can't sing? From the mellow Delirium, to the in-your-face Serenade of Self-Destruction, her range, flexibility, and skill never fail to be jaw-droppingly stupendous. She switches seamlessly from heart-melting, operatic notes to aggressive snarls that you almost don't notice until they punch you in the face. What struck me most, however, was the sheer, raw emotion she conveyed overall. There were moments in Serenade of Self-Destruction that sent chills down my spine; as for Twin Flames...words cannot describe it.<br /><br />That doesn't mean, however, that Simone's voice was the only good part of the release. The lyrics are a work of art in and of themselves! The fact that the band puts as much thought into them as the music itself is one of the reasons I keep coming back to Epica. DYU metaphorically deconstructed the workings of the universe. RFTI builds on that. The message is clearly there: It is not enough to live in this world. We must open our eyes, and be aware, not only of the truth of our own lives, but also that of others. Ignorance is not an excuse for shifting the blame for the many things wrong with the world, and inaction.<br /><br />It is true that I did not find the riffs to be as memorable as the ones on DYU, but only slightly less so. Even given this, the album grew on me after a while. There are also more growls on RFTI than there were on the previous releases, which perhaps is reminiscent of MaYaN's Quarterpast. I, personally, have no problem with this, as I very much enjoyed that album as well. I like the death metal texture to Epica's music, and it's why I choose Epica: the so-called \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" vocal combination, with a brutal side serving of metal! I listen to Epica for just this sort of thing, a death metal opera sound that I have not found anywhere else. If I want straight symphonic metal with all clean vocals, I stick to bands like Nightwish, Xandria, Within Temptation, and Delain.<br /><br />Stylistically, there is more of a progressive influence present on this release; the ever-shifting time signatures, musical textures, and clean/growled vocals weave the songs together into a bombastic tapestry of operatic, melodic, classical, death metal, symphonic, progressive...awesomeness.<br /><br />To sum up, no, this album is not Design Your Universe V 2.0, and to be honest, I was a little disappointed that this album wasn't as good as DYU and The Divine Conspiracy. However, it would be difficult indeed to top the epic epicness of Epica's last album, which set the bar sky high. So why did I give it 4 stars? It's because, considered on its own, Requiem for the Indifferent is still a good album in its own right. It is evident that Epica's style, musically, vocally, and message, is evolving. The only constant is change; it's only natural. It's certainly different; all I can say is, I like it on its own. I would recommend giving this a listen.

0439023521|5.0|This book is truly amazing! It is set in such an interesting time period, and the way the world is run and the things that go on will make your mind go crazy! The characters are all very relatable, and come from interesting backgrounds with a story to tell. The far fetched concept of the Hunger Games really catches and holds the readers attention, and it automatically sucks readers in with its dramatic storyline. It is one of those books that can't be put down, and the end will leave you hungry for more!

U2 is cool!

B0071LLHGC|5.0|This is a \\"gray area\\" release from the folks at Left Field Media,recorded before a small (and very lucky) audience on August 26th,1971 at A & R Studios in N.Y. and broadcast by WPLJ-FM. The sound quality was a concern for me but this sounds as if they had access to the original tape as opposed to just capturing the FM broadcast. Its every bit as good as any of their (legitimate) live releases and having a recording this good with Duane  is a revelation. Duane (and the whole band for that matter)are in top form.This performance from the original line-up is a must have for Allman Brothers fans. I'm not sure how long this release is gonna be around but my advice is to get it while you can at a reasonable price. This CD (at the time this was written) is available from Amazon UK for less than $15,shipping included. Track List Below.<br />1. Statesboro Blues<br />2. Trouble No More<br />3. Don t Keep Me Wonderin<br />4. Done Somebody Wrong<br />5. One Way Out<br />6. In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed<br />7. Stormy Monday<br />8. You Don t Love Me<br />9. Soul Serenade<br />10. You Don t Love Me<br />11. Soul Serenade (In Memory Of King Curtis)<br />12. Hot Lanta

From the brilliant acting by the ensemble cast to the exceptional cinematography.<br />Story is very plausible, dark, moody, enchanting...it truly showcases the seedy side of LA.<br />This movie made me believe in the vunerabilty of \\"bad guys\\" as Russell Crowe moves from vicious thug to gentle lover of a troubled hooker portrayed by Kim Basinger's finest hour.<br />Fall in love with LA with all it's warts and see this movie.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent free app. lots of games to keep boredom at bay. some are a bit tough and the point values are silly, but you get what you pay for...
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book has a lot of fab pictures and letters.  I liked it BETTER on the fire because I could zoom into the pictures and see them larger than in a book.  The book itself is interesting and has lots of neat images and ideas.  I actually loved the whole book until the end.... I won't ruine it, but I feel like the last chapter musta fallen out of my copy....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Once I figured out how to download it, it downloaded fast.  I tried all the directions sent to my email and I could not get it to work, what I did was download the Amazon App Store, then downloaded the Kindle for android app and installed it.  This worked very well.
B001VLXNLU|1.0|It's very rare that once I start a book that I don't finish it. But I just could not get through this one. I decided to put it down after Zoey says \\"good thing there's a bathroom right there in case I get diarrhea in the middle of class\\" or something to that effect. It was just the last straw for me. There was nothing interesting or compelling about the story. Also why are there so may parentheses? It's written in first person. The plot is thin, the writing is uninspired and the characters are flat and annoying. I would not recommend this book for anyone, for any reason.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Although I'm only 90% per cent finished this book, there's no way the ending is going to resolve some of the issues I have. This book -- to steal from Gygax -- is not a natural 20. (see how I don't explain that? you either get it or you don't - take note, mr. author).<br /><br />1) The dialogue (or lack thereof). There is so limited dialogue between characters in this book that it reads like a very long creative writing assignment one would do in primary school that's heavily based on descriptors and narrative, but lacking in character development and interaction. When the characters do speak to each other, it's pretty bad. Not Gilmour Girls bad...but close.<br /><br />2) Lots of explanation (frankly too much) for every 80s detail makes it all the more contrived. If this book is supposed to cater to GenXer's (of which I am), then I don't need someone to tell me what 2112 was all about. Klosterman and Coupland are pretty good at this - striking the right balance between explaining the more trivial points of pop culture without completely spoiling it for those that already know and don't need the Curious George version. The author goes far too overboard with this and makes me think it's *not* written for the X'ers but the teens that might be discovering the 80s now that they've realized how much the 2010s more or less suck culturally.<br /><br />It's a mindless, amusing read. That's it. It's not a bad book at all but it has no business getting 5-stars from anyone that reads more than 5 books a year AND don't have plots involving vampires, teenagers killing each other in a game or a school for wizards. If you want sophisticated, intelligent writing involving virtual realities, best read from the masters: Gibson and Stephenson.<br /><br />I can only assume that the 5 stars being handed out like sweet lines of cocaine from yesteryear (strange how *that* part of the 80s is untouched) is because this tugs at all the genX heartstrings reminiscing without thinking critically(shame on you folks, seriously). Do yourself a favour and go watch a John Hughes film instead (preferably in VHS or BETA).
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Not to bad!  Fun way to pass time while waiting for your dear old mother in law to get done with eye Dr . Lol :-) Someone was complaining about privacy um  this is the world wide web if you want to hide something don't put it on. the web poeple . just my opinion great game!
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Well this certainly proved to be as epic as people said it was.<br />I haven't read a fantasy novel for some time but I greatly enjoyed this.<br /><br />Some people have said that there was a shortage of sympathetic characters but I don't really agree with that.<br /><br />It wasn't that predictable and some things happened that did surprise me.<br />It was also quite realistic with even the characters who might seem \\"evil\\" just acting in the same way that virtually all medieval rulers did act.  They were just totally ruthless rather than evil for the sake of it.<br /><br />The language is quite plain but sometimes it is quite evocative.  The dialogue is well handled and realistic.<br /><br />It was a little slow moving in places but strangely I was never bored.
0439023521|5.0|My 12 year old son loves this book, he tells me everything he reads. Hes reading 2-3 chapters daily. He cant wait to read the others.
B0056A9WF8|5.0|This was a greatly enjoyable little novel. I have seen the original film a few times but I still greatly enjoyed this.<br /><br />It has a real seventies feel to it and I must admit I didn't really get some of the references.<br /><br />It is extremely short and is much more of a novella than a fully formed novel.<br />It is all a bit silly in away and does require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief  but it is basically just a fun read that does have a bit of a serious side.<br /><br />Levin was a very good writer and I think that it works well with the short length though it may have been nice to have a few things fleshed out.<br /><br />I really liked the ending though I think that a few readers haven't liked it much.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Overall, MDNA provides a fantastic return to the music scene for Madonna and will go down as bright spot in an already illustrious career.  The title perfectly sums up how the music has the M(adonna)-DNA - there are throwbacks to classic Madonna tracks with a taste of what the future holds for her. MDNA has Madonna doing what she does best - lighting up the dance floor, opening a window into her life, and boldly trying something new on her own terms.  I'm glad to report after a few listens that Madonna sounds more reinvigorated than ever!<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild - This song has been a major grower for me. It comes packed with awesome beats that are ready for the dance floor. While not the best track here, it's great in context with the album as a whole, and the Act of Contrition opening is epic (and a fitting way to start the album). Madonna is a master at using visuals to get her message across - if you haven't seen the hot black and white video for this song, go watch it now! It's a great throwback to the Madonna of Vogue/Erotica/Human Nature. The song is pretty fun.<br /><br />Gang Bang<br />LOVE this track - it's by far the most unique thing Madonna has done since Music's 'Paradise (not for me).' Madonna sing/talks over a hard, throbbing, industrial beat, violently describing how she's going to shoot her lover - very dark stuff here. I was quite surprised that William Orbit produced this track - it shows a major departure for what you're used to from both him and Madonna.<br /><br />I'm Addicted<br />Another great dance track, I'm Addicted beckons you to get into the groove.  There's a cool urgency in both the lyrics and Madonna's delivery that I really enjoy. This would easily be popular in the clubs.<br /><br />Turn Up the Radio<br />This is the most radio friendly track. It's light and fun and all about moving on and getting away from the things that hold you back. I hope it's released as the next single. It's the perfect summer anthem. While not my personal favorite, I love hearing Madonna sound so happy in a song. Also, I'm a big fan of remixes, and I imagine some cool djs could go crazy with this song. I could have even seen this being a strong lead single.<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin<br />Unlike some people, I love this song. It's simple, catchy, and fun as hell. I don't think it ranks as Madonna's strongest lead single by any means, but it's great fun, especially in context with the other songs on the album. Knowing next to nothing about Nicki Minaj and MIA, I enjoy their small raps too. For me, their parts made the song much more interesting and unique.  The exuberance in this track is contagious.<br /><br />Some Girls<br />This is perhaps the biggest surprise for me. I don't know why, but I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Love the production from Orbit, and I love how Madonna sounds flying through this tune, telling us how some girls will never be like her - how true! It reminds me a little of 'She's Not Me' from Hard Candy, but I think this track is better.<br /><br />Superstar<br />While sugary sweet, this song isn't my favorite of the bunch. Lots of other reviewers have compared it to 'True Blue,' which I can easily understand. Like a friend of mine recently said, even a \\"bad\\" Madonna song is miles better than most of what's out there - and I don't think this is bad by any means .. just not my favorite. Upon further listen, I would move this to the bonus tracks and replace it with \\"Beautiful Killer.\\"<br /><br />I Don't Give A<br />Great beat, great urgency throughout with a vivid, personal look into Madonna's life. She sings fast, in a sort of rap in much of the song. As with 'Like it Or Not' from the Confessions album, Madonna sings about doing her best and not caring what others think, which I appreciate.  The Minaj rap fits in well.<br /><br />I'm A Sinner<br />Production-wise, this Orbit track sounds like a mix between 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Amazing.' It's miles better than 'Amazing' and probably as good as 'Beautiful Stranger.' Madonna's vocals start off sounding quite strange - very high and thin, but it's fitting. Vocally, I feel like Madonna's taking a major risk here by trying something new. This song would make a pretty awesome single too - it's catchy as hell and provocative.  Again, Madonna sounds like she's having a lot of fun.<br /><br />Love Spent<br />Damn, a Madonna song with banjo!! This, along with the acoustic version, makes me hope for an all acoustic album from Madonna one day! Another very personal track, probably about her past marriage. There's a feeling of deep longing here. The arrangement of this song is quite unique too. I can see why it's a fan favorite.<br /><br />Masterpiece<br />I wasn't sure this Golden Globe Award winning song would fit into the album, but I'm pleasantly surprised that it does. In the context of the album, this is a great track, a sort of slow down from so many heavy dance beats. It's a nice ballad that harkens back to Madonna's Ray of Light days. There's a sadness here that Madonna does so well. Vocally, she sounds great - people can say what they want about Madonna's vocal abilities, but few artists out there can emote like she does.  This song is running over with emotion.<br /><br />Falling Free<br />This strange slow song ends the album on a melancholy note, much like \\"Easy Ride\\" did with American Life.  I prefer \\"Easy Ride,\\" but this song is growing on me.  In comparison with the rest of the record, it's such a simple song in regards to production and instrumentation.  The style also reminds me of \\"Mer Girl\\" from Ray of Light.<br /><br />Beautiful Killer<br />The first of the bonus tracks, I love this song! It should be on the main album, replacing \\"Superstar.\\" A portion reminds me of \\"Die Another Day,\\" a song I love. It's got a great chorus that really sticks in your head.  Out of all the songs here, this one really has that classic Madonna feel, so I'm surprised it's not a part of the main set. I could even see it being a successful single.<br /><br />I F***** Up<br />Not a bad song, but I kind of wish Madonna would have changed it to \\"I Messed Up.\\" The vulgarity of the \\"F\\" word in the title is a bit of a turnoff for me. Otherwise, it's not bad.  Again, Madonna gets really personal here, describing all the ways she messed up with a an important relationship. I like the cheeky ending that makes you wonder if she REALLY thinks it was all her fault.<br /><br />B-Day Song<br />This song has a cool 60s vibe, and I like the simple sound. It seems like Madonna and MIA just sat around and banged this out on the fly, much like the early version of \\"I Love New York\\" on the Re-Invention concert album sounds. While fun, I can see why it didn't make the main album.<br /><br />Best Friend<br />Another personal song about Madonna's failed marriage to Guy Ritchie (or, that's the assumption, anyway). Again, not a bad track, but I can see why it didn't make it on the main album.<br /><br />MDNA is a great blend of what Madonna does best. While it's too early for me to say how it'll rank overall, I already like it much better than her last album, Hard Candy (which I like, but don't love). MDNA is a cool mix of Ray of Light meets Confessions on a Dancefloor with a little Music thrown in - and even some throwbacks to the Erotica days.  It's amazing to me that an artist that has been around this long is still putting out such quality music - people should really respect that. The sequencing of songs could be improved, however. A track like \\"Gang Bang\\" should not show up so early in the set .. there should be more of a lead up to a song like that.
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book which is a sort of combination of writing guide and memoire.<br /><br />He offers some great advice.  I have found it to be extremely useful though I think that his lack of plotting a book out in advance might not be to everyone's taste.<br /><br />In particular there is a lot of useful stuff about editing your work and he includes a sample of his work to illustrate this process.<br /><br />I haven't read any of his books for some time but this does tempt me to give them a go. He does have a nice easy style in this book.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|Fling! one of the best game. game play is very simple but it is very addicting. can't stop playing the game.
B002RZZIXU|5.0|This is a very well written book and it is also a real `page turner' as well. The author has a great ear for dialogue and the writing is also very descriptive.<br /><br />The storyline was intriguing and everything is generally well worked out and makes sense.<br />There was a good sense of time and place both for the events occurring in World War Two and in the seventies.<br />I thought that maybe the ending could have been expanded on a little and that to a certain extent some of the storylines involving the daughter were a bit vague and could easily have been left out. However he is such a good writer I didn't really get impatient as I read the book.<br /><br />Despite some small reservations I really enjoyed this.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|My friend highly suggested this book to me. A few pages in, and I thought she suckered me into reading some \\"Mommy porn,\\" as some sites have suggested. I was skeptical - highly skeptical - that I'd continue reading it.<br /><br />Now having finished reading it, I will have to admit (begrudgingly) that she was right. It *does* get better. By the end of the book (which I just completed 5 minutes ago), I was nearly in tears! And I am so eager to start reading Book 2.<br /><br />Aside from the original source of the idea for this story, it made me think about other love stories as well as my own. I really felt I could relate to Ana, and in a way, you kind of feel her pains -- physical and emotional. But you also feel for Christian.<br /><br />It's a great book with great characters. It's far from the trashy novel I was expecting it to be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is not a typical type of book for me to read. First, I am a guy and second, I tend towards Science Fiction. I saw some news/talk show coverage about the book, was on vacation, and decided to give it a try. I am very glad I did. It had me locked in from the start. It wasn't the sexual content that kept my interest but the characters. Well, one character. I think I am in love with Anastasia. She is so well written. I finished all three books in a week and am now lamenting there isn't a fourth... or, fifth.<br /><br />Ms James,<br />Thank you for the wonderful novels. I live in the Seattle area, grew up in Portland and thoroughly enjoyed the local flavor.<br /><br />Steve.

B00005N6KG|5.0|This is the second pair of these headphones I've had. The first I got along with a minidisc player I bought (which tells you how long my last pair lasted - they finally had a speaker die a few weeks ago). For the price, you can't beat these. They're light weight, yet stick to your head and stay in place really well in case you're like me and can't get earbuds to stay in your ears. I absolutly recommend these for regular listening, but especially for exercise.

B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game and creating a city. Its a must buy. I also have this game and other GA games on my iphone.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|As a precaution, I thought it was important to note that when it comes to The Mars Volta, I tend to get very emotionally immersed in the music of each new album which sometimes makes it difficult for me to judge the merits of the album objectively until later, when I've taken a good break away from it. To this day, I still see De-Loused in the Comatorium as a flawless classic, and Frances the Mute, despite all of its grandiosity, is a very solid effort as well. The Bedlam in Goliath was an explosive rebound to the disappointing Amputechture, and its chaotic and urgent atmosphere took hold of me like a victim of musical Stockholm Syndrome in that I was enamored with the album for weeks and was unable to judge it fairly until I broke free. Afterwards, I came to the decision that while it's a good album, it's a bit too overwhelming for regular listening and a lot of the songs become redundant after a while. The more somber tone of Octahedron coincided with a time in my life in which I was experiencing some deep emotional turmoil, and while the album was on constant repeat for a few weeks during that time, it is now hard to listen to the opening track \\"Since We've Been Wrong\\" without a feeling of bitterness. Aside from my own personal reactions, I would still consider Octahedron a bit too melancholic to be one of TMV's best. I would say the only TMV album that has thoroughly disappointed me right from the get-go, however, would be Amputechture, whose scatterbrained overindulgence makes for a very tedious listen. If I do listen to it, I skip right past \\"Vicarious Atonement,\\" and really, every other track after that.<br /><br />Now moving to the present - Noctourniquet. At the moment, I have this album on repeat and I'm very into it, but I don't think I'm jumping the gun when I say this may very well be their best effort since De-Loused. However, I said the same thing about The Bedlam in Goliath, so I may be revising this review later, but as I perceive it right now, it may very well be the most balanced and consistent TMV album to come out in a while. I had my reservations considering the absence of John Frusciante (one of my all-time favorite guitarists), Ikey Owens, and Thomas Pridgen, but in retrospect, it seems like this stripped down version of The Mars Volta is exactly what was needed. Deantoni Parks takes a break from the fast-paced and bombastic drumming styles of Jon Theodore and Thomas Pridgen to offer a more straight-forward drumming style, while still adding some nice fills here and there, which I think helps the album flow more smoothly. Omar has stated that his playing of all guitar and keyboards on this album has allowed to consider a more balanced position for both the instruments, as opposed to the wall of guitar sound that has often drowned out Ikey Owens' keyboards in the past.<br /><br />Songs like \\"The Whip Hand,\\" \\"Lapochka,\\" and \\"Zed and Two Naughts\\" are all electronic-heavy, which adds a great new perspective on TMV's classic sound, while \\"Dyslexicon\\" and \\"Molochwalker\\" sound like traditional TMV and would have not been too out of place on De-Loused in the Comatorium or Frances the Mute.  \\"Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound\\" and \\"Trinkets Pale of Moon\\" are slower, more melancholy tracks that would have fit in on Octahedron - and both seem reminiscent of King Crimson, who have been a major inspiration for the band. \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Imago\\" trigger thoughts of German krautrock band CAN, who have influenced the band as well. \\"The Malkin Jewel\\" is an amazing track and is unlike anything heard in TMV's back catalogue; I think it exemplifies the \\"future punk\\" sound that Cedric was talking about and I hope to hear more songs like this from TMV in the future. The other tracks all find their place within the album and contribute to an intriguing and varied listening experience, while still maintaining consistency and a smooth flow.<br /><br />While I consider De-Loused in the Comatorium to be TMV's classic, holdingNoctourniquet to that standard might seem a little unfair, as TMV has come a long way since their debut album. But when compared to more recent albums, I think this album is a great step out of the stale and overindulgent prog-metal sound that the band had started to become entrenched in, and quite frankly, it's a lot more enjoyable of a listen. The band has shown that it isn't afraid to go outside of its comfort zone and make a more straight-forward album that still experiments and doesn't compromise artistic integrity - actually, it promotes artistic integrity. Omar has defined this album as \\"the end of an era\\" and states that all future albums will be a more collaborative process. Now that TMV has fully regained my interest, I'm intrigued to see where they will go from here.<br /><br />Best tracks: The Malkin Jewel, The Whip Hand, Empty Vessels Make the Loudest Sound, Molochwalker.Noctourniquet to that standard might seem a little unfair, as TMV has come a long way since their debut album.

B005LL4U54|5.0|In a technical sense, this is simply a marvelous score. Learned ears will hear references to a myriad of 19th Century classical staples and homage after homage to Franz Waxman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner, and Alfred Newman (as well as the seeds of Bernard Herrmann's trademark suspense tones in the action cues and Maurice Jarre's later work late in \\"Fantaisie D'Amour\\"). Lighter passages of prancing rhythmic flair, meanwhile, are reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin, Leigh Harline, and Carl Stalling.<br />Minus three songs (and one track), the soundtrack contains completely original pieces of music by Ludovic Bource.<br />He has crafted a timeless film score that is magical being listened to in association with the movie or simply on its own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There is so much written about this series now, especially with the movie out, so I will just say that I am a 52 year old woman and I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book.  And for what it is worth, I thought the movie did it justice (though of course the book is much richer in details and story).  I read this, and purchased the second story immediately.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|After playing the free version of this game for months, I picked the paid version up as the free app of the day a while back. Then, I started noticing some quirky stuff.<br /><br />Why does this game REQUIRE internet access to be played? If I lose my cell connection in the boondocks or a concrete building, then I cannot play fruit ninja. Wtf?!?<br /><br />Why does this PAID app need to access my camera and my contacts? There is something seriously wrong with that.<br /><br />Also, after having played this game for all of 20 minutes, my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus showed a drop of 40% battery life. Checking the battery stats showed me that it was 95% fruit ninja's fault. I also noticed that over 50% of the mobile data I had used that day was used by fruit ninja. BUYER BEWARE!

If the fluffy game characters aren't for you, you can always use one of the other themes provided. This app is a definite recommend! I know I actually paid full price for this one, but it's been well worth the money. If you like logic puzzles, I'd definitely recommend you try this one!

B006ZZC3D6|5.0|No matter how hard I try and what tricks I use to make it reveal itself, I can't find OpenFeint anywhere on this app.  I don't get the standard \\"No, Thank You.  I don't like to have fun\\" splash screen.  There are no OpenFeint junk files dropped on my SD card.  I even turned off my internet connection trying to get the OpenFeint offline message.  There is an in-app High Score Leaderboard (hence the need for the Network Permissions), but it appears to be a legit programmed part of the app, not an OpenFeint add-on.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--I'm very glad I can't find it--I hate OpenFeint.  My only concern is that they are getting so sneaky about it that it can be invisible to the user.  However, I doubt very much that that's the case.  I'm wondering if the developers saw the start of the onslaught of OpenFeint complaints and quickly replaced it with a non-OpenFeint version.<br /><br />Is everyone else besides me being hit with that crappy OpenFeint?  If so, I wonder why I'm so lucky not to be--maybe I should play the Mega-Million Lotto today--it's over 540 million. LOL<br /><br />As far as the game play goes, it's very good.  I've played other versions of this type of puzzle game before and I've always enjoyed them.  The pluses of this app are: smoother and brighter graphics, different modes of play (Free Play, Arcade, Challenge, Frenzy), and the number of puzzles (it's says 100,000 over 35 levels).  All these features were lacking in the other apps I've played.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the series. It was very detailed and thought provoking. Some of the language in the first book seemed overly simplified but as the series progressed it seemed to flow better. My only complaint is that in book three due to everything Katniss has gone through, the reader misses a lot of the action that happens.
B0063ESZ9K|3.0|The Fuji case fir the camera is really well made. However, the big problem is the design. Unlike other cases, when opened, the fold down portion is not attached in a convenient way to the rest of the case. It just snaps on. The problem is it falls off all the time since it is not fastened to the rest of the cast when opened and you have no place to put it. This is very annoying. Anyway, the camera is great. However, more thought should have been given to the case design.

B006W0QOF2|4.0|i really appreciated the quiet way the film was introduced, all of the silent moments were the most intense and captivating, some of the ballsy moves made by Driver, and was hoping for the best - for the driver - the entire way.<br /><br />one of my most favorite scenes is after testing out the race car, driver meets the 'financial backer' for the first time.<br /><br />love the significance, later reference, and meaning of the handshake scene, where Driver, rightly, instinctively, is cautious about shaking hands with Bernie, both mentioning their 'dirty hands'.  Driver hesitates, but gives nothing away with his eyes or body language.  And we later hope that he doesn't shake hands with Bernie as his pal Shannon was so eager to.<br /><br />thanks Amazon for the awesome deal.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|First of all I want to say that this product works beautifully. It was simple to set up, and within 15 minutes I could access my entire PC from my tablet. Originally, I was planning on rooting my Kindle and flashing CyanogenMod7 in order to access 3rd party apps, as well as do a few other things that it wasnt allowing me too. Now that I have Splashtop, I've been able to work arond most of those problems.  Soon I'll be takng it out of the house and testing ona wifi connection, thorough a tethered droid phone.  I'll be sure to get back on here and let everyone know how that went.
0393340244|5.0|Cordelia Fine does a fine job of breaking down the pseudo-science behind gender stereotypes.  She persuasively explains that the myth that men are systematizers and women are empathizers is exactly that.  And she's absolutely right in that we all are a mess of conflict and contradictions, and we shift our identity according to the circumstance and the group dynamic.<br /><br />Not only is the book clearly written, but it's backed up with rigorous support.  However, I do find her tone polemic and condescending at times, and it would have helped her cause if she admitted some clear biological differences between men and women -- for example, women, and not men, do get pregnant.
B00436GNVC|5.0|I think she has one of the most unusual voices I have ever heard.  I get tired of the exact same sound and tone of voice that everybody has. How boring....  She is refreshing and wonderful. She has a smooth rich tone and I love her vibrato.  Check her out, you won't be sorry if you like something different.  Her sound is mostly slow jazz and some blues.

B00584UD32|5.0|[[ASIN:B00584UD32 Kind Of Blue (K2 HD Master)]]  It's only once in a great while, that we see and hear from a musician possessing such great talent. If you like jazz, it truly doesn't get any better than this. If you don't like jazz, don't listen to this album. It will ruin you forever. One of a kind! A true master of his craft, at his peak. Stars don't apply here, this is true beauty. One of the best, period. Amazon Thankyou.

1451683405|5.0|This is an enjoyable essay which manages to squeeze memorable argument and humour into its 66 pages. Harris finds time to labour the point about the spontaneity of thought, but this is justified by the corollary in respect of free will. Harris's observations and evidence about how we think and act seem intuitive to me, and I feel as though I've always known it. Harris's comfortable introduction of neuroscience findings into his argument is welcome.<br /><br />Harris breezes through some conclusions in respect of the penal, religious and political consequences of his thesis. While his arguments are sound, his conclusions will not attract a positive reaction from those with contrary views. Given that these views are the result of an individual's background and day-to-day events, such a reaction is in fact a compelling argument for Harris's case. On the other hand, it is refreshing to see that many reviews for this book examine his arguments critically and are not based solely on preconception.
0385534639|5.0|Marco and Celia are pitted against each other in a mysterious game they have been preparing for since they were children. Le Cirque des Rêves is the staging ground - a magical circus full of wonders.<br /><br />The Night Circus seems to be one of those books that people either love or hate, judging by the reviews I've seen. The story is quite slow to develop. The main characters don't even see each other for years at a time and compete by adding wonders to the circus to out-do each other. If you're after a battle with Cruciatus curses flying around, you're in the wrong place.<br /><br />I loved reading this book. It's hard to put into words why I did, but I think the descriptions of the Cirque is what did it for me - Morgenstern's gift for beautiful prose is undeniable and she conjures dream-like images from every page. I may just have to get myself a red scarf and become a rêveur!<br /><br />Set in and around the late 1800s, the story is made up of many small chapters, switching between several different threads of story. At first this was a little confusing  because some sections are later in time than others, but once I started paying attention to the dates at the start of each section I understood better how all the threads fit together. Another potentially confusing element is that it is told in the present tense. It took me a little while to get used to it, then every now and then there is a section of second-person point of view (for example, \\"You move the curtain aside\\") which allows Morgenstern to describe a tent that the characters haven't visited.<br /><br />As the story moves on, the threads become shorter and closer together, until they are woven together into one story. The story itself does peter out a little at the end, the action giving way to a lengthy discussion between characters in the last few chapters.<br /><br />The author has created a cast of interesting characters, complete with a web of relationships. The romance is sweet and delightful, although there isn't really any explanation as to why it exists. That didn't stop it from sending tingles up my spine while reading, though.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern's debut is a delight to read. If you love magic and descriptions of beautiful and fantastic places, read The Night Circus without delay!, although there isn't really any explanation as to why it exists. That didn't stop it from sending tingles up my spine while reading, though.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern's debut is a delight to read. If you love magic and descriptions of beautiful and fantastic places, read The Night Circus without delay!
0307352145|5.0|The name of the book is \\"Quiet\\".  The theme of the book is \\"The power of introverts in world that can't stop talking.\\"  When I heard about this book I knew I immediately wanted to read it.  Being labeled an introvert I wanted to see what Susan Cain had to say about the subject.<br /><br />Indeed, her book has sparked many conversations between me and a co-worker who teaches classes on people's strengths.  We have compared her illustrations of how introverts handle situations to what we have seen in reality from myself and people he knows.<br /><br />This book has been a great encouragement and eye opener.  The author made me laugh when she describes situations of extroverts, for example, getting us all hyped up for sales, etc.  Been there, done that.  After working for 2 companies who value their employees and thus offer personality tests and classes on the results, I highly recommend this book just to give you more insight and to be thankful and proud to be the introvert you are.<br /><br />I received this book in exchange for a book review from Multnomah Publishers.  This review is my own opinion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have a bit of trouble loading new locations. Other than that. I love this app. I love watching the rain approaching and knowing the sevarity of what is coming. Also the outlook for the next few days. I give this app. an A- . Thanks you all for this one. D. Williams
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Very enjoyable movie to watch with any one.<br />Cutest movie I've seen yet.<br />See It over and over again with the same satisfaction.
0006486118|2.0|First off, I am not finished reading Dragons yet. I'm a quarter way through, but that doesn't mean I can't comment on this book because the errors Martin made in \\"Feast for Crows\\" are just as apparent as they are here.<br /><br />From what I've read so far (and this includes \\"Crows\\") this series is out of control. The +200 pages I have read are bursting with clumsy writing, people wandering and sailing forever, and a constantly expanding universe of new characters, new cultures and new plot lines - all of which I find displeasing. I'm already burdened with remembering who the Lannisters, Starks, Martells, Freys, Tullys, and every one else involved is. Please stop adding new characters.<br /><br />When I read \\"Game of Thrones,\\" it was simple. Now it's agonizingly complicated, all because Martin has forgotten where his epic is going.<br /><br />Thanks, sir, for complicating an already needlessly complicated epic. I will finish Dragons, but I do so under protest.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Normally, I don't care for books and tv series with teenagers as the stars because you get a lot of angst and whining. Hence, the main character played by Tyler Posey. Luckily for me, the other characters were way more mature and gave the series that adult theme it really needed. The story was darker and I'm not at all oppose to the cuties who started in it. I have a madwoman crush of Tyler Hoechlin now. LOL.<br /><br />The stories were well written and entertaining. The bad guys were dysfunctional and that made for great fun. Can't wait for the next season. I'm more excited about Teen Wolf than I am about True Blood.
1847392148|5.0|I loved the book, great item for a crazy addicted to Indiana Jones. I recommend this book for everyone who wants to learn a little more about Indy!!!!!
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Overall this book is so well-written and beautiful. The author has a way of making you feel like you're there with her as she makes a choice that is literally life or death. I read this in one day because I couldn't put it down, I felt as if I was sucked into the world of Mia.<br />If I Stay is a book about a girl with a huge choice. After getting into an accident with her family, she finds herself standing in a ditch totally fine. She looks for her family, with grim results. Then she finds herself, bleeding, broken and not responsive.<br />She follows her mangled body to the hospital where she thinks about her life as a musician, as part of her family and as a girlfriend. Does she stay without her parents or does she go and leave the world behind? This is the question she has to ask herself and the question you will have to read the book to find out.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book was as good as the first.  I can't get enough and can't wait until the third book becomes available.  I love the writing style and can create such vivid pictures in my imagination when reading.  I recommend the series to all my friends!
B005LAIGNC|1.0|Haven't seen \\"Red Tails\\" yet but I have been riled by the fact that Lucas and everyone else seems to have conveniently forgotten that this movie was already made as \\"The Tuskegee Airmen\\" in 1995 (see the IMDB listing) by PBS and was a multiple award-winning feature (again, IMDB).<br /><br />Since Cuba Gooding Jr. was in BOTH movies I would have thought that at least HE would have mentioned this to someone.<br /><br />Just because George Lucas remade it with up-to-date special effects and CGI does NOT make it the only movie ever made about the Tuskegee Airmen or the best movie ever made about the Tuskegee Airmen.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of my friends recommended this book to me.  We now describe it as EPIC!  It's one of the best books I have read in a long time and I would highly recommend it to others.  It grabs your attention and keeps you hooked until the final page.  I had to buy the second in the series before I even finished the first because I didn't want to put it down!  Wow, I wish book #3 was available!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is really great, it has all the accommodations that a good alarm needs. Works great for Kindle Fire and if you have music you can listen to that when you wake up. You should totally get it because if you don't a little girl named Sarah will show up in your house and gut you like a fish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|She is stellar!! This is a fabulous DVD/CD -- great to hear her voice-- she doesn't disappoint.  You will never stop enjoying her singing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, it wasnt a book that you had a hard time putting down, but was a book that you enjoyed reading and hoped teh best for the good erson
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|\\"Puss in  Boots\\" was okay and would probably be enjoyed more by children than by adults.  Featuring the Egg as a major character just didn't fit the script and was rather dumb, we thought.  Then making the Egg untrustworthy fit the scenario even less.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the content of this book may disturb some readers, the writing was superb.  It's a book that's hard to put down.  Every character was well-defined.  I was able to completely visualize the events through the author's wonderful descriptive technique.
1568461828|5.0|I ordered this book a long time ago and am now writing my review. I looked at the book again today. The story itself is old and wonderful. I am truly astounded at the artist who painted the illustrations. I want to chop this book up too and frame the art. Incredible. This book is one that you won't want to bury on a shelf someplace but have it close at hand so you can revisit England in the 1800s with so much detail that you are practically in the picture. I also bought a copy for my cousin and her reverence for this book almost exceeds mine! If you are in the market for a copy, this is the one to buy. It will be passed down through the generations and won't end up in the church rummage sale. Gorgeous in every way.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Easy to use. Only issue is when the ipod is off and you plugged in or out the adapter, the ipod is turn on automatically. A little bit over priced.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very fun.  Much like I remember on the computer.  Works well and the play is very smooth.  I would recommend this app.
B004HW7JHE|1.0|I was excited that Mad Men was back, until I watched the first episode. If the entire series was this wooden and boring, it would have been cancelled after the pilot. Episode one was poorly written, badly directed, and the actors seemed to be just going through the motions. If the rest of the season is this bad, you may want to think twice before plunking down your money. Talk about not living up to the hype!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Fits really well. Works exactly as described. I was not very happy with the price because similar product for iPad costs the same.
0552773891|5.0|I have absolutely fallen in love with this book. The story's focus is the life of a young girl that Death (who by the way is the narrorator of this particular story) encounters when her 6-year-old brother dies. The setting is a small town outside of Munich during WWII in Nazi Germany. Having read multiple Anne Frank books as well as other stories of the suffering of Jews during that time, it was interesting to reading a story from the perspecive of a young German girl during a horrific time in her country. If your anything like me, you'll need to grab some tissues for the last 50 pages or so. I HIGHLY recommend this book and have added it to my list of favorites.
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|i love having to manuever the fur balls off the grid. thinking is minimal but a must...so its a great time wasting game. Glad i grabbed it and tried it. now i must have highest score!!
B003UESJHO|3.0|Great pricing. Speedy delivery...certainly a plus. However packaging was a concern. DVD arrived crushed and was floating in the case. It suffered several scratches as a result. So far plays fine.
1932100660|5.0|I'm 2/3 through a book called \\"The China Study\\" by  T Colin Campbell, Ph.D., an icon in the field of micro-biology and nutritional medicine.  The book reflects the culmination of 27 years of analytic research, all peer reviewed and published in all the right journals of medicine, into the associations of diet and Western Diseases - including all the cancers, heart disease, diabetes (1 and 2), and obesity. His research was triangular: Molecular laboratory studies, laboratory studies with rats and mice, and the most comprehensive epidemiological study on nutrition and disease ever conducted - which is the title of the book - the China Study.<br /><br />I'll touch on the lab study with rats and mice, whose findings were confirmed by the other two types of studies. The livers of thousands of rats were injected with Aflatoxin, a highly toxic carcinogen. Then they were separated into two groups - one group was fed a diet of which 5% of calorie intake was animal protein (casein).  The diet of the second group consisted of 20% animal protein. The normal life span of the rats is 2 years.  Within 18 months, 100% of the rats fed the second diet were dead or dying of cancer of the liver, while 0% of the first group died of this disease.  Dr Campbell's group was astonished, as a 0 to 100% result almost never happens, so they did the study again, and again, and again, scores of times.  They then decided to use a different specie, using mice instead, and got the exact same results.<br /><br />In the China Study, the epidemiological study that extended not only to China but to the Phillipines, Indonesia, and other Asian countries, the research group learned that there appears to be a one-to-one correlation between eating a Western diet (meats, dairy, eggs) and the incidence of cancers, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.  Again, in regions where greater amounts of animal protein are part of the diet, they found greater incidence of Western Disease.  And the more animal protein people ate, the more the incidence of these diseases, the less animal protein they ate, the less incidence of such diseases.<br /><br />I believe that if you read just the first 69 pages, the first 3 chapters, you won't be able to put the book down. It's one of those life changing books.
0618918248|2.0|I have read many books by Dawkins and his ilk and I have read many alternative arguments. One should educate oneself on a topic from a variety perspectives, in this way one gains a better understanding of the complexity of the issue and develops a sounder judgment. In order to undertake this process correctly one must try to be as an OPEN MINDED as possible and eliminate preexisting prejudices or indoctrinations.<br /><br />And this is where Dawkins fails, he is far too intolerant and aggressive in his OPINION. To speak on a such a topic with such conviction and certainty is mere folly.<br /><br />The truth is that no one can prove the existence or non-existence of God, to say otherwise would mean that the individual concerned simply fails basic logic  in terms of absolute certainty.<br /><br />The existence of God or no God is always a matter of faith and one's subjective interpretation. Science does not prove or disprove God and the belief that human science is without flaws or without considerable restrictions is also a subjective interpretation. For what we see may be an illusion and/or our intellect and senses may only see a crude representation of the Universe. A representation that may be full of error.<br /><br />Dawkins also attacks religion, stating that it has been responsible for the deaths of millions. True religion has been a factor in millions of deaths, however if you read between the lines you realize that many of these deaths occur under the auspices of religion for other factors such as greed, lust for power and resources.<br /><br />What Dawkins neglects to mention is that millions and millions of individuals have been killed by atheists they include : Hitler who killed 12 million and if he had defeated the USSR another 30 million Slavs. This of course does not include the 40 million who died as a result of his aggressive policies. Stalin killed 23 million and Mao the world champion of killers, killed 78 million.<br /><br />In fact Hitler used the survival of fittest doctrine to support the killing of inferiors, a doctrine based on Darwin. So it is quite evident that atheists kill with the same relish as believers. In fact one could argue that atheists are more inclined to kill since they have no fear of ramification in the afterlife for evil action. People will kill because of human failings not because of religion, religion or no religion there will be murder and war.<br /><br />True there are intolerant faiths that have no respect for different viewpoints and use force to crush intellectual freedom and we know which faiths they are. In this respect Dawkins is right, regressive religious cultures and the countries that suffer from them will likely be locked into poverty and ignorance forever.<br /><br />However not all faiths are equal, Christianity may have been aggressive and intolerant once, but that cannot be said today. In fact it has tolerance today (majority) for free thought and other faiths and cultures. And it certainly has not stood in the way of democracy, science and civil liberty as can be seen in the Europe, Australia, New Zealand and North America.<br /><br />Secondly, it is a significant fact that for certain people religion is essential, because without it, according to their perspective we would live in a bleak , cold and purposeless Universe. Now Dawkins may be able to live quite comfortably without a god, but individuals differ. What philosophy works for some may never work for another.<br /><br />A belief in a God gives these people a purpose and value, it helps them handle the fear of death and grief, especially the lost of loved ones. Why take this security blanket from them? It may be a lie that they live under, but if it helps them handle life and overcome depression, such a lie may be beneficial? Religion and faith have been utilized by many to pull themselves from depression or a very defective lifestyle. Without religion it is hard to see how these types would have changed their life.<br /><br />So certain religions, the tolerant ones, are perhaps beneficial for society in that they aid many individuals who would have otherwise declined into depression without it. And it is precisely because of this NEED that Dawkins will never be successful in eradicating faith. Certain people need a faith and will create one if there is none because they NEED this security blanket. Even in secular Europe, 70% of people still describe themselves as spiritual according to one poll.<br /><br />So if religion is tolerant of other viewpoints, what is the problem? Not all religions are equal however and it is intolerance and arrogance of certainty, that in many areas of endeavor not just religion that cause destruction. For materialism which Dawkins worships is also a quasi-religion or belief system and it is quite apparent Dawkin's  extreme followers suffer such failings as well. Have tolerance of others and always be willing to admit that you may be wrong.<br /><br />And this is were much of humanity fails, their ego's and mentalities are so attached to their belief system and indoctrination that they cannot examine issues objectively. The longer attached to these belief systems the more difficult it is to change or be flexible. Then you have the mentality of group think and conformity that reinforces these prejudices and beliefs. The atheists have their tribe and so do the believers.<br /><br />The decline of the USA is a telling example, you have two sides, liberals and conservatives, that are incapable of compromise. As a result this country is too paralyzed to undertake the urgent actions required to prevent future collapse.<br /><br />( Read this book: \\"The Logic of Failure Recognizing and Avoiding Error in Complex Situations\\".<br /><br />This German psychology professor believes people court failure through sloppy or ingrained mental habits, whether the mistakes involve cleaning dead fish out of a garden pool, adding rooms to a schoolhouse, launchingeconomic development programs in Africa or forecasting oil prices or the scope of the AIDS epidemic. )<br /><br />Plus I must note from my readings and from reviews at Amazon that atheists have a certain arrogance to believers in a supreme being. One cannot escape the conclusion that they hold such believers as dim wits, individuals of low intellect and education, that you have to be dull to believe.<br /><br />Well lets have a look at some of the great intellectual minds that believe in some type of god they include:<br /><br />Albert Einstein Nobel Laureate in Physics Jewish<br /><br />Max Planck Nobel Laureate in Physics<br /><br />Protestant Erwin Schrodinger Nobel Laureate in Physics Catholic<br /><br />Werner Heisenberg Nobel Laureate in Physics Lutheran<br /><br />Robert Millikan Nobel Laureate in Physics probably Congregationalist<br /><br />Charles Hard Townes Nobel Laureate in Physics United Church of Christ (raised Baptist)<br /><br />Arthur Schawlow Nobel Laureate in Physics Methodist<br /><br />William D.

So much for the \\"low intellect\\" argument<br /><br />Then there is this from the internet:<br /><br />\\"Why the mathematicians, more than other scientists, tend to believe there's a God<br />Of all scientists, mathematicians are most inclined to believe in God. - A finding of Professor Edward Larson of the University of Georgia and Larry Witham of Bartonsville, Maryland, in a survey of 600 scientists, as reported by the London Weekly Telegraph.<br /><br />In 1916, Professor James Leuba of Bryn Mawr University in Pennsylvania surveyed the religious beliefs of scientists. He found that about 42% believed in God, almost exactly the same percentage did not, and another 16% described themselves as doubtful about God, although not convinced of his non-existence. In short, about 40% could be described as believers and 60% as unbelievers.<br /><br />The Leuba survey created a sensation. Politicians expressed fears that university science courses would lead young people away from religion. Prof. Leuba himself envisioned a continuing trend away from God, so that by the end of the century few if any scientists would be believers.<br /><br />Therefore, with the year 2000 close at hand, Prof. Larson and Mr. Witham conducted a matching survey. Had the Leuba prophecy come true? They found it had not. Belief and non-belief among scientists had not significantly changed. The total expressing belief was 39.3%, while 45.3% listed themselves as unbelievers and 14.5% as doubtful. The 60-40 ratio held.<br /><br />This assumes, of course, that it has remained consistent throughout the century. It may not have. Prof. Leuba may have been right for a time as the number of believing scientists continued to shrink, but the trend may have later reversed.<br /><br />The Larson-Witham survey did turn up some unexpected changes. Three disciplines were examined: physicists, biologists and mathematicians. In Prof. Leuba's day, the most determined unbelievers were the biologists (69.5%). Today it's the physicists and astronomers, 77.9% of whom list themselves as such. Biologists, meanwhile, seem to have somewhat recovered their faith, though the Telegraph story did not cite a specific percentage.<br /><br />The relatively improved faith of biologists may well be due to the gradual decline in credibility of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Too many holes have appeared in it, and biologists would be the first to become aware of this. They would know before anyone else, for instance, of the failure to discover the fossil remains of transitional species, of the failure of laboratory experiment to duplicate any evolutionary change and, most recently,of the profound complexities evidenced in the single cell, which Darwin regarded as \\"the simple cell.\\"<br /><br />But it seems that faith is strongest today among the mathematicians, 44.6% describing themselves as definitely believing that behind reality there must be some kind of Mind. Wondering about this, we consulted two friends, one a retired physicist, the other a young mathematician. Both are believers. Why, we asked, would mathematicians be more prone to believe?<br /><br />The physicist's answer went like this: \\"I suspect it comes from the role mathematics plays in the exploration of the solar system. After all, using nothing more complex than Newtonian mathematics, the mathematician calculates the necessities of sending a rocket from here to Venus where it orbits and gathers thrust from the rotation of that planet, then comes back and circles Earth, gathering further thrust from our planet, then goes to Jupiter and takes up a precisely calculated position around that planet. All on the basis of simple Newtonian maths. The mathematician marvels at this. He begins to see mathematics, not as a mere humanly contrived system, but as a great work of art by a great Creator, and he is awestruck.\\"<br /><br />The mathematician, Mike Roshko of Edmonton, graduated in pure mathematics from the University of Alberta two years ago, found there were no jobs to be had in this line, and is now a computer programmer in Ottawa. He answered this way:<br /><br />\\"For me, it's amazing the way in which the seemingly different areas of mathematics fit together. When you begin studying advanced math, you tend to think of geometry, algebra, analysis and so on as separate entities, each beautiful and elegant on its own.<br /><br />\\"But as you go on, you realize that these different areas are connected in the most astonishing yet natural ways. You may discover that what you thought of as purely a part of geometry turns out to be an essential part of algebra. And what we're dealing with is not just something we've made up. It's a reality. It's there.<br /><br />\\"And it all intertwines and works so perfectly, so beautifully, that you realize that Somebody or Something must have done this. It simply could not have happened by chance. It's a kind of revelation, I guess. And it's very convincing.\\"<br /><br />Addition:<br /><br />Now they say never to argue with people over religion, it seems that my review has alienated SOME atheists, in that it contains some arguments in support of a designer and the names of some great minds who believe in one.<br /><br />Additionally, the review has also irritated some believers who believe with ABSOLUTE certainty that there is a God. By stating that belief will always be subjective in nature. (THIS CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO ATHEISTS)<br /><br />This topic is full of closed minded individuals, who are so certain.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|My wife and I rented this movie from Amazon Instant Video one Friday night.  It was very good.  Actually, it was better than I thought it would be.  The acting and script are believable (not full of too-witty, too-canned dialogue like most Hollywood movies are).  There is some good humor in it too.  And this movie MEANS something.  Which is why Hollywood doesn't \\"get\\" it.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|\\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is without doubt a masterpiece of English literature. This funny, engaging and extraordinarily well-written work of classic fiction not only entertains and enchants, but also gives a glimpse into a very different time, that on closer inspection isn't very foreign at all. If you have not read this book (or if you only remember it from being compelled to read it in school) I cannot more heartily recommend picking up this free ebook and giving Austen a chance!

B005PTQPU0|5.0|This album may seem plain and slow at first. As a musician and a music connosieur of many genres, this album's sophistication blows me away, it demonstrates how remarkable music can result from very basic and simple ideas. Every song tells a sweeping story, both lyrically and musically, with what some may call repetitive rhythm, yet it is filled with intricacy and very handpicked from Kate's own universe of extraordinary intuition.<br /><br />The musicians play no more and no less than what makes each minute perfect. The songs are generally lengthy but never dull, not a bore at all. This album will leave you with a smile several times throughout, it is a product not of mental genius, but truly from the heart.<br /><br />Kate is a master of the word and the beat!<br />PS: I recommend the UK release, and checking out the album's videos (\\"Wild Man\\") on youtube.

0061191981|4.0|I've enjoyed watching Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares for a while now, and always found Chef Ramsey a bit fascinating, if not amusing, so I was not sure what to expect when reading an autobiography. Truth is, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this memoir of sorts. He's had an interesting life, and this book shares tidbits from his life, in short, bite-sized nuggets of information, that gave me a completely different perspective on the man behind the chef.<br /><br />More interesting to me than that, though, was learning some of the behind the scene drama in the restaurant world. I guess I'd never really thought about it before, but to learn about what a small world the fine-dining restaurant scene is, not just in England, but apparently, all over. It makes sense that there are only a limited number of brilliant master chefs in the world, those capable of achieving the covered stars and accolades, but I'd never thought of the behind the scenes aspect of it. This book lets the reader in on many of those behind-the-scenes things of some of the most famous establishments.<br /><br />If you're a reader who happens to like the shows Ramsay puts on television, then you're likely to enjoy this book too. It definitely, as the title suggestions, contain some strong language, but if you watch Ramsay, you probably knew to expect that!

B004EN8KE2|2.0|I'm glad that I only downloaded the audiobook from my library rather than actually buy it. The story is good and interesting. But my God the person doing the reading is downright annoying. Especially when she tries to do male characters. Hey lady, you're not a man, so give it up and don't even try to be. Her voice acting makes what is otherwise an enjoyable and compelling book sound like a complete and utter joke. Considering the success of the books and the recently released movie I hope they have the decency to re-release the audiobooks with a better reader. Why oh why could the reader not just have read the entire story in a normal voice instead of trying to be a voice actor?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So I first purchased this book a couple of months ago. My goal was to read it and the other two before the movie came out. That totally didn't happen. I saw the movie last Friday night and decided it was high time to read the books since the movie was AWESOME! I must say, the book did not disappoint in comparison. I loved every minute of it!! So good I purchased the next one right away and am almost finished reading it as well. This book (and series) has so much more in it to demand a reader's attention than most books! READ IT!!

B002DEZXOE|3.0|Woodstock, 1969 film     The story begins with a local man talking about the famous outdoor show put on in August 1969 in Bethel New York. Workers prepare the ground (a cow pasture) for the show. There is a raised stage, lights are lifted into position. It took nine months to prepare. Bands rehearse. People arrive on various vehicles, like old school buses rented for the occasion. Unusual costumes are worn. Some dance, driven by an inner spirit. [If you drove south on the Thruway from New Paltz that Friday evening you would have seen tremendous lines of cars waiting to exit.] The various comments tell what people thought. Accommodations quickly fill up in the nearby towns. Helicopters are hired to transport performers and their equipment. An announcer reads messages to the crowd.     The show begins with a song by Richie Havens, how life and war goes on. \\"Clap your hands.\\" People enter the grounds by climbing over the wire fences. \\"It's a free concert now.\\" Next its \\"Canned Heat\\". Joan Baez dreamed about Joe Hill (framed for a robbery-murder), then sings a gospel song. \\"The Who\\" sing Eddie Cochrane's famous \\"Summertime Blues\\". A couple talk about their non-traditional lives. \\"Sha-Na-Na\\" sing their one big hit. A man talks about yoga. Joe Cocker sings a Beatle's song and feels the emotions. Rain causes a pause that creates mud and complaints. Sliding in the mud and other acts are shown. This show will be a financial disaster. \\"Country Joe and the Fish\\" play music then sing. Arlo Guthrie sings about flying into Los Angeles. People pass a joint around. \\"Crosby, Stills and Nash\\" sing and play music. [They needed more practice.] \\"Ten Years After\\" sings \\"Go home to my baby\\" and other songs. Then the Intermission.    The new dawn brings new acts. Grace Slick sings with the \\"Jefferson Airplane\\" band.. Visitors comment on conditions and phone home. \\"Its so great in some ways and so lousy in others.\\" People walk through the mud. Is there gas for cars? A group sings. John Sebastian speaks to the crowd then sings about aging and new conditions. [Does it make sense?] \\"Country Joe\\" sings his big hit song. [Nihilism?] An old man complains about the crowd, he lost all his milk and the hay was ruined. Others comment on \\"the kids\\". Some bathe in the pond, skinny-dipping. A surfboard in this pond?\\" \\"Santana\\" plays \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" with its frenzied drumming. \\"Sly and the Family Stone\\" sing about getting higher. He asks for a sing-along at night. Janice Joplin sings about not having someone to love. [Maybe it's a personal problem?] Can they feed breakfast to 400,000? The portable toilets are serviced. \\"See you later.\\" Max Yasgur speaks to the crowd. What does this show?     Jimi Hendrix plays a guitar in his style and sings. Recognize the tune \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\"? The empty grounds look like the aftermath of a tornado, clothing covers the grounds. A man tries on discarded shoes. We see the large crowds still there. Then it ends with a view before the show. The credits roll naming the performers and the others who worked on this production. The song \\"Woodstock\\" was written by Joni Mitchell. At the end there is a list of people who have lived. \\"Find the cost of Freedom\\"? This movie is dedicated to the \\"Woodstock Generation\\". Does anyone use that phrase anymore? After forty years this movie seems less great as if it has aged. [Or is it me?] Those performers are mostly a memory today. History has turned another page. NY politicians passed new laws to ban this type of concert. [I once read that some of the investors bought out the others, then profited by selling the film rights. Does that sound like show business?] This movie, like those from the 1930s, is a historical record of that era. The failure to control and collect admissions put an end to these open space shows. It's the money, not the music, that's important.

0525423656|3.0|WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />In my review of Matched, I made a mention of the fact that I was \\"eager\\" to read Crossed \\"despite\\" the reviews I had read. And I was, I really was. The problem? I should have listened when every single one of them said-in one way or another-that nothing happened.<br /><br />Alright, I'm getting quite snappy and far ahead of myself. I was excited to pick up Crossed, because I thought Matched carried so much promise. Before 100 pages had gone by, however, I was quite disappointed. My first shocker was that the book kept switching back and forth between Ky and Cassia as narrators. Yes, yes, I see that the blurb mentions that, but I didn't read it before I dove right in. I probably should have, but what can I say? The back and forth got quite choppy in places, and as Ky and Cassia met up again it got fairly bulky. Some of those chapters seemed like they were just thrown in so that a chapter break could be had in between (mostly) Cassia's viewpoint.<br /><br />My second problem was the apparent ADD the book had developed. Now, I don't mind flashbacks when they're done properly but this...wasn't it. Both Cassia and Ky were jumping in and out of the past and present with almost no warning, leaving my jolted out of the writing and thoroughly confused. This was heavily prevalent in the front of the book, disappeared in the middle and showed up once or twice again in the end. It was a very, very messy use of flashbacks that left me rather annoyed.<br /><br />The thing about Crossed is that it really wasn't a book. Sure, there was a vague plotline taking place, but if I was being kind I'd call it filler in between Matched and the final and yet untitled third book. It was barely even that. Reading Crossed felt like reading Condie's character sketches and paragraphs of her own personal delve into her world's background. There was more discussing of Ky's past, Cassia's inner feelings and a whole lot of dark poeticism on love, life and philosophy.<br /><br />*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />By the time any real plot developments occurring, I was already quite done with the book. I skipped through most of the middle and missed nothing. The only reason I started reading again was because Cassia and Ky found each other and I'm a sucker for romance. When it did occur, however, it felt...trite and forced. For instance, Ky's whole issue with going with Cassia to the Rising. He goes on and on for chapters about how he can't go with her, but then when they finally decide to go there is no question that he's going with her. As if there ever was. Xander's \\"big secret\\" as being a member of the Rising felt contrived so that the love triangle would remain viable. And of course, that end. THAT END. No, no, no, no. At least make it somehow believable. All this fighting and nearly dying and death and self discovery to get back together and Cassia ends up being sent back into Society by the Rising where she SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED because she ought to have been RECLASSIFIED as was mentioned several times throughout the story. None of it made sense and none of it felt right.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Overall, Crossed was a huge disappointment. I really, really wanted to like this book, but it just defeated my attempts at every turn. If you really do want to hold on to this series, I don't recommend reading this one unless you are deeply in love with Cassia and Ky's romance and think learning all about Society's history, Cassia's inner thoughts and Ky's past is awesome and can overlook that it isn't presented well. Personally, I wish I'd just read a summary and kept waiting for the finale. Though I am still vaguely curious about how the last book will go, I now feel that Condie's storyline is far too predictable to keep me on my toes, so whether or not I actually read the final book will depend on my whim and the money in my bookstore stash. It certainly won't be a must-get for me.y.<br /><br />*SPOILERS BELOW*<br /><br />By the time any real plot developments occurring, I was already quite done with the book.

0142419400|5.0|When I started this blog, I swore I would be analytical. I swore that I would look at a book with a critical eye no matter how much I enjoyed the storyline. Since then, I've done that. Or at least, I think I have. (Drop me a line if you think there's a way for me to improve my reviews!) Either way, if you like a critical book review...stop reading here. Almost nothing in this book is going to be critical. I am going to allow myself to be the 17 year old girl that I am and just...gush.<br /><br />Because I loved this book.<br /><br />I'll admit, I nearly gave this book 4 ½ stars simply for the fact that I don't want to be one of those people who throws around 5 star ratings. But then I stopped and thought...why? There is absolutely and utterly no reason.<br /><br />I should start this off with a disclaimer: I usually HATE books that are entirely teen romance. I hate them. I literally hate them. It's like all YA authors think that these things need to be filled with a bunch of clich&eacute;s and fantasy. (Disagree? Comment and give me a book as an example!) When you pick up Anna and the French Kiss, the synopsis doesn't seem promising. Girl goes to boarding school, girl meets guy, they fall in love, PLAY THE SAPPY HAPPY ENDING! It is the plot of ten dozen different teen novels with the same exact premise as this one.<br /><br />But that is not what happened here.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss was REAL. In some YAs--and this is especially horrible in the first person, as Anna and the French Kiss is written--the main character is clearly being written by an adult. There are a myriad of ways that this shows itself, but all us teens know it. During this book, however, Anna was either absolutely and utterly exactly like me or at least a girl I would kill to have as my best friend. She was actually a teen like me, who thought like me and talked like me and related in every which way to me. Even if this book hadn't had some other amazing qualities, I could have liked it just on that alone. But it got better.<br /><br />The plot was REAL. Alright, it was fairly fairytale, what with the Paris setting and the hot English guy, but I'll forget about that for now. Anna was not a sad, swoony girl who knew that she and Etienne were soul mates from the first second. Etienne did not fall in love with her at first glance, nor was he a jerk who changes his ways because of her or some other clich&eacute;. He was a real guy. She was a real girl. They both had their issues that weren't just limited to their families (though there was certainly some fairly clich&eacute; family/father drama). They both had their own personality issues, and they both made some choices and had views that weren't necessarily correct.<br /><br />Hallelujah for an author who gets it.<br /><br />Alright, the ending is pretty fairytale. They all live happily ever after in the most swoon worthy fashion. That didn't bother me all that much. Maybe a little bit of fairytale isn't that bad after all. The plot was real enough and I loved the characters so much that I honestly wanted that happily ever after. Despite its premise and ending, though, Anna and the French Kiss has been an answer to my prayers. It's a teen romance I can stomach, has a main character that's real and has a love story that's parameters weren't set up by the Brothers Grimm. It's well written, it's cute, it's funny and it's REAL. I hear that Perkins's next book, Lola and the Boy Next Door (on shelves now), has a more realistic setting and I am jumping up and down to get a hold of it.

B00701QVVY|4.0|The Electric Age is an excellent follow-up to last years amazing comeback Ironbound.  It is the perfect example of how thrash metal SHOULD be done in 2012. There is not a single song on this CD that I do not like.  Thrash metal fans will certainly enjoy this CD and if you liked Ironbound then The Electric Age is a MUST for you.  Overall The Electric Age is an outstanding recording that is chock full of fist pumping and head banging thrash metal that will bring anyone back to the day when thrash reigned supreme.

B0040HO16S|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey or any other Masterpiece Classic show, you will adore this sweet series. I think the first few episodes are clumsy, but by the fourth episode, Lark Rise finds its stride. One day I plan to own all the episodes just to be able to watch them whenever I wish. I can't say enough great things about the show to my friends. It's really a hidden gem!
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|This Open Feint is sketchy.  I had an app once with it and lots of strange things happen with regards to increases in mysterious spam e-mails and link redirects.  I got the feeling someone was watching everything I did on my mobile device and now had access to my e-mail address.  I don't download anything anymore with Open Feint on it and would recommend against it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|When I saw the title 'Slammed', I wasn't sure what to expect. And I'm glad I purchased the book.<br /><br />My simple definition of 'Slam' is a Passionate Poetic Performance. And much more. But make your own definition by reading this book. Trust me, it is so undervalued!<br /><br />I am writing this review after having read both books in the Slammed Series. And you will need to read them in order - Slammed, then Point of Retreat. They're told from different perspectives and it was very interesting. 24 hours later and I'm still thinking about this book.<br /><br />Slammed was a YA Romance Novel with Great Substance. It was Lake (Layken) and Will's love and self-discovery journey that was complete with excellent supporting characters. Those supporting characters add so much depth to the book that, without them, the book isn't complete. The book flowed so smoothly from beginning to end and it definitely is one of my 'memorable' books that I will never forget and made me really appreciate the art of writing (by Colleen Hoover).<br /><br />Slammed took me on an Emotional Journey, with lots Self-Reflection, and it was quite Thought-Provoking. Colleen is an Awesome Author that I will surely follow. She had a new concept that I have never read about before (in a very Positive way). And She had many quotes that you simply have to say that it sums up the point neatly.<br /><br />Like I always say in my reviews, I am a softie, and I smiled, laughed, and cried so much while reading this book. And I couldn't help myself but finish it in one sitting. Make sure you have a box of tissue with you. And hug your Mum and Dad and brother and sister (and anyone else in your family really) and tell them you love them if you can. You'll know what I mean if you give this book a go.<br /><br />I think this book is suitable for 12+. It is clean, but you might argue that it's a little on the 'heavy' side. Hey, life isn't so light and fluffy is it. So read it first before you let your kid read it and judge it for yourself. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Some of the quotes that I'd like to share from Slammed are:<br /><br />'Life happens. S*** happens. And it happens a lot. To a lot of people.'<br /><br />'Sometimes, life gets in your way. It gets all up in your damn way. But it doesn't get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control. Life doesn't get all up in your damn way because it just wants you to hand it all over and be carried along. Life wants you to fight it. Learn how to make it your own.'it and judge it for yourself. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />Some of the quotes that I'd like to share from Slammed are:<br /><br />'Life happens. S*** happens. And it happens a lot. To a lot of people.'<br /><br />'Sometimes, life gets in your way. It gets all up in your damn way. But it doesn't get all up in your damn way because it wants you to just give up and let it take control.

0307593312|2.0|Well, I read the whole thing, hoping it would get better and start to make anything close to sense.  It didn't.  Honestly, the world would be a better place without this book.  It's not that it is \\"bad\\", it's just...  there's no point.  It's like pocket fuzz.  Entirely unnecessary.<br /><br />The characters are uninteresting.  The most interesting thing about the main character is that her name is \\"Green Bean\\".  Awesome.<br /><br />Each chapter we hear the inner monologue of one of the few characters in the book.  But the inner monologues all have the same voice, ie, the author's.  /Probably/.  The author is fixated on \\"head shape\\" for unknown reasons.  The characters occasionally engage in bizarre extreme sexual relations for no apparent reason other than I guess the author's entertainment.  The author contradicts himself and his story on a regular basis.  It's like he couldn't be bothered to read what he wrote 400 pages before and make a story that had any consistency.<br /><br />There's no conclusion.  You learn nothing.  The journey is probably supposed to be the reward, but, it isn't.  This book is like the turtle in the race who FINALLY gets to the end to discover he came in last.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Edward Zwick's \\"Blood Diamond\\" (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, \\"This is Africa.\\"<br /><br />The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.<br /><br />I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or `blood diamonds' until seeing \\"Blood Diamond,\\" so the film is successful just by being educational.<br /><br />Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.<br /><br />Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.<br /><br />GRADE: Bcan get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.<br /><br />GRADE: B

B00756GKBA|5.0|Minus the excreable lead-off singles (Give me All Your Love, Girl Gone Wild), this is a great album. Standouts for me include Gang Bang, I'm Addicted, Turn Up the Radio and Love Spent. Some Girls is also growing on me at a rapid pace. I think once these songs inflitrate the radios and clubs, the album should settle into a solid reputation. And this is a vast improvement from Hard Candy. It's more like Angry Confessions on a Ray of Light.

0307346617|2.0|I started it once a few years ago and set it aside but The Walking Dead on TV made me pick it up again.  I enjoyed it but i do not think its great.  The style is original.  A bunch of seperate stories without a cohesive story line.  That's what i did not care for.  I know that a lot of people like the style of the book but to me, it felt incomplete.  Like there was no true beginning or true end.  There wee no main characters.  No one to root for.  It was just a bunch of small vingettes.  Too many questions left.  How did it start?  How did it spread so fast?  How did the dead manage to live under water without being crushed by the presure?  It was an enjoyable book but left me feeling like there should have been more.  Oh well.
0374275637|2.0|If this is your first book on psychology and human behavior you are probably going to learn a lot. However, if you kept up-to-date on behavioral finance, negotiations or psychology for the last ten years, you are likely to discover that you've read all of this in bits and pieces.<br /><br />Daniel Kahneman is probably a giant in his field and was a trail-blazer, along with Amos Tversky. But this trail has been blazed in the 60's and 70's. It since has been accepted by many others in a variety of fields. Consequently, many books and magazine articles have been written that reference Kahneman & Tversky's work, but get to the point much, MUCH quicker. In contrast, this book reads like a long, dry, academic treatise.

B006YXTRHY|3.0|The movie was alright. But really, it doesn't really matter if this movie was downright terrible beccause people already love the characters so much because of the book. If this was just a movie and no books it wouldn't be half as popular.<br />  I'll start with the stuff I liked. First off I thought Taylor Lautner did a much better job in this movie then any of the others. I thought Seth and Leah were also good and suited their roles right. Billy Burke is always a pleasure to watch, along with Peter Facinelli.<br />  I'm sorry but I am not a fan of Kristin Stewart. She's not quite there yet for playing Bella. I think she's pretty and has the right look for her but she throws too much of herself into it. As an actor you're supposed to become the character not let the character become you. Her own arkwardness as opposed to the feminine shyness of Bella shows thru more then anything else and I'm just not a fan of it. I am also not a fan of Robert Pattinson, at least not as Edward. He can be so monotone with his lines and the true emotion of it doesn't come thru. When he needs to be angry, I can believe him but any other emotion is lost on me. All in all the movie was alright and people will like it just because of the name of it. I think it could've been cast better.
0439023513|2.0|Possible Spoiler, but not really =)<br /><br />I felt like Suzanne got bored and was told to just \\"finish up.\\"  She shared so many details in the characters and relationships for 2.5 books and then just drove it into a wall.<br /><br />Basically, everything after a certain family member's explosive demise, the book took a turn south.  Everything is vague and rushed.<br /><br />In the end, it was basically, \\"Oh...so-and-so has a job in District 2 and must be happy, so I might as well stay with the other guy...\\" and then  \\"5, 10, 15 years later I finally relented and gave him some kids.\\"<br /><br />Sorry, but total cop out.  I rarely read but was compelled to read this books.  I loved them so much...until I had about 75 pages left of Mockingjay.  Now, I just feel cheated.  I don't regret reading them; I only regret that Suzanne gave up and complete Mockingjay with the same care and details of the other two books.

B000X107GI|5.0|There's really not much to say, these are batteries. Many times you order from online places and they come damaged not working, or exploded (which is damaged, but a really messy and bad kind of damaged). These came on time and worked fine. I changed out to batteries in my car remote and one in a tire pressure monitor. All worked great right after.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was truly a great visionary, but also a flawed man with many attributes that made it difficult, if not impossible to work with him most of the time. Even so, he fought to bring the world products of great simplicity and beauty. There are few people in this world like him, and this book paints a clear picture of his success and failures in the brief time we had him with us.

I was 11 when JFK was assassinated and have often thought \\"What if?\\"  I have not finished this book yet.  It does go on and on quite a bit in some places, but I am enjoying the story so much that I really don't want to get to the end.  I know Stephen has a dark mien and I'm afraid what I'll find there.  I know I'll enjoy it though.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I completely love the Game of Thrones series, and have watched the episodes multiple times. The scenes in the show are filmed gorgeously and are fantastic on Blu-ray. I'm especially glad I bought the first season for the special features (like how they created the intro, and George R.R. Martin's thoughts on the series) and the commentary (given by both the producers and the actors so you learn behind the scenes tricks, like they use black paint instead of water for the pond at Winterfell, as well as fun stories from the actors). I have recommended this show to all my friends and I'm super happy I bought it.

B007JF87VS|2.0|I will say at the start that, while I read Kirkman's comics before watching any episode of the show, I'm not a long-time reader or greatly enamored of them.  But, I definitely appreciate the first volume.  In this episode, we finally get to the powerful moments of that book's final pages... and the TV script butchers it.  The main botchery is that the big \\"reveals\\" were given away several episodes ago, in a manner that makes me wonder if somehow marital secrecy has acquired a stronger taboo for screenwriters than those that used to apply to marital infidelity.  But, even considered as a self-contained unit, this does a gross injustice to the source material.  There's no sense of surprise in the final confrontation, even on the part of the characters, and without that, Rick just seems \\"felony stupid\\".  And THEN the most dramatic moment of all is reduced to an afterthought.<br /><br />And then there's a technical quibble that's a big one to me: Given the amount of head trauma that even regular people have been known to survive (see the famous case of Phineas Gage), the \\"shoot them in the head\\" doctrine of the zombie genre doesn't make a great deal of sense.  (I've openly taken issue with this in my own zombie fiction.)  But, if anything is going to make even the undead go down and stay down, it's the destruction of the hind brain or the severing of the spinal column.  So, how exactly does even a zombie go for a stroll with a broken neck????

B001GKJ2DY|2.0|The touring musical, MAMMA MIA! now becomes a musical movie. Rated &#34;PG-13&#34;. Running Time: 1 hour, 48 mins.<br /><br />Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married in your birth town of Kalokairi, Greece. She wants her dad to give her away, but she doesn't know who her father is. So she invites all three men, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and Harry (Colin Firth). They think that her mother sent the invitations.<br />She has not told her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) yet.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep and Piecre Brosnan singing?  The singing in this musical is mediocre, but you might enjoy the songs which came from the Swedish pop-rock group, ABBA (1972-83).<br /><br />ABBA was Benny Andersson, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus. Their songs were so popular, they were used in 1999 in the touring musical, MAMMA MIA!.<br /><br /> I did not like this movie too well, but I thought Amanda Seyfried was perfect for her role. She did a wonderful job.<br /><br /> Option to turn on &#34;Sing Along&#34;.<br /><br /> Option of Language and Subtitles: English, Spanish, French.<br /><br /> Feature Commentary with Director Phyllida Lloyd.<br /><br />***Sequel: Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! to be released July 20, 2018. With Pierce Brosnan, Meryl Streep and Cher.<br />  Meryl Streep and Cher have worked together before in Silkwood (1983).<br /><br /> Meryl Streep also sang in [[ASIN:B0000AM6IS Silkwood]] (1983).<br />[[ASIN:B001NFNFLC Ironweed]] (1987).<br />[[ASIN:B000059XTI Postcards from the Edge]] (1990).<br />[[ASIN:B000H6SXYM A Prairie Home Companion]] (2006).<br /><br /> If you did not like the movie, Mamma Mia! (2008), may I recommend:<br /> [[ASIN:B001KZOVJK Evil Under the Sun]] (1982).<br />  It's a good Agatha Christie mystery. It's not a musical, I promise.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Hmm...what can I really say about the final book? Well, to be blunt, I didn't really like it, and before you go accusing me of hater status you should know that I did, in fact like the first novel. The second one I found to be so-so. Of course, I thought that the final book was magnificently written, great detail, and editing that smacks of sheer perfection. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past the actual story. It was just plain disheartening to read. I think I still could've nevertheless gotten over this if hadn't been for the death of Finnick. He's a major character by this point and his demise is just so utterly pointless and well, not the least bit dramatic or heart-wrenching. It's just one line he's there, the next he isn't, the story moves on. She seems to make a half hearted attempt at redressing this near the end, but it's not enough. Overall, the book just ends up being too depressing, even with the nice, flattened ending. Oh well, just my opinion, nothing more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing! I couldn't stop reading intil I was done with the series!!!!!!!!!!!!  …  …  Happy Hunger Games!!!!  :)…… …… And May The Oods Be Ever In Your Favor!! :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What I mean by that title is that this book and it's two sister books contain subject matter that's a bit more mature than what you might find in other YA books like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. Really, I wouldn't suggest these books, especially the last one, to anyone under the age of 18. That might seem a bit conservative of me but for crying out loud, the author periodically maims and kills characters that are 12 and 14 years old, in what is sometimes irritating detail. Overall, I liked this first book and its ending, much more so than the two that follow.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids enjoy playing and their is more than one thing they can do. it is great on the go.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I don't have overly much to say about this particular book in The Hunger Game series. Except for what basically amounts to the very beginning and the very ending of the book, it all seemed like just a rehashing of the first book with slightly different characters and settings. Oh, and somehow the author managed to make it all just a little bit more violently depressing.
B006VB0ROG|5.0|This show isn't my sort of thing usually, but it's a cute idea and executed creatively enough so that I occasionally watch it. The idea of using storybook characters and placing them in contemporary, real life situations and roles is certainly one of the most unusual if not more creative ideas for a TV series I've seen. They engaged a number of more than competent actors and character actors for the series, the scripts are good, the direction is taught, and overall everything is just very well done whether this is your sort of TV fare of not.<br /><br />For example, the episode that I saw recently, Desperate Souls, had Robert Carlyle playing Rumplestiltskin (the British actor who is most remembered for playing the lead in \\"The Full Monty,\\" the hit flick from the mid-90s), and Brad Dourif, who played the old monk, another one of my favorite character actors. Dourif has had a varied and diverse career and I remember him especially for a riveting role where he played a psychotic killer on Star Trek Voyager. But he's perhaps most remembered for his role playing Pieter de Vries, the mentat assassin, in the movie, \\"Dune.\\" His role as the old monk was just pure Dourif, played with an intensity one associates with Samuel Jackson but with just the right idiosyncratic touch of pure looniness and craziness thrown in for good measure--which no one can do better than Dourif. And Carlyle is great as the cowardly Rumplestiltskin, who gets his courage back and defeats the local cruel prince.<br /><br />Overall, a fine series and a great show for the whole family that relies more on interesting and strong characters, good scripting and acting, and doesn't need to resort to the usual sort of cheap sensationalism, violence, sex, or whatever to keep the audience's attention.
030788743X|5.0|Sometimes I finish a book and I want to spend a lot of time thinking about it, and maybe write a discursive and possibly self-indulgent response to it.<br /><br />Other times I finish a book and smile and say, \\"Damn, that was fun! More like this, please.\\" Ready Player One by Ernest Cline was like that.<br /><br />It's a dirty, disturbing vision of a year 2044 when just about everyone has given up living in the real world in favor of a virtual realm called the OASIS. People are so caught up in this game-like way of life they scarcely notice what's going on outside. OASIS creator James Halliday has just died, and though he is the world's wealthiest man, he's also a hermit who left behind no heirs. He left behind an elaborate contest within the OASIS in which anyone and everyone can search for a hidden easter egg, and whoever finds it will inherit his vast fortune as well as control of his company. Millions set off in search of the egg, and when the novel begins the search has been underway for about five years, and nobody has yet found even the first of three keys, which will open the three gates (also hidden) which are necessary to obtain the egg.<br /><br />The above may sound like spoilers but this is basically the setup within the first few pages, and the story proceeds from there. We meet Wade Watts, a young \\"egg hunter,\\" and follow his interactions with others on the same quest.<br /><br />The quest itself is entertaining, but the real thing going on here is that James Halliday, a child of the 1980s, has sprinkled throughout the message he left behind announcing the contest a large number of hints and red herrings all taken from 80s pop culture -- dialog from John Hughes movies, lyrics from an Oingo Boingo song and more. There are a few cultural tidbits on focus here which are outside my own historical interest -- never much of a Black Tiger player here -- but far more elements I recognize from my own trip through the decade of my adolescence. Arcade games like Tempest, Pac Man, Joust and Battlezone, movies like Blade Runner and Monty Python's Holy Grail... the music, the Dungeons and Dragons. Such a lot of fun here! This is one of those books I want to recommend to anybody and everybody within five years of my age (those born in the 60s), and it might even be fun for people outside that range.<br /><br />All Ernest Cline seems to have done before this book was to write the screenplay for the film Fanboys, a sort of trial run for the sort of geek obsessions on display here. I can't wait to see what he does next, and fully expect to read this book again. Highly recommended, unless the kind of cultural references listed above are totally uninteresting to you.Tempest, Pac Man, Joust and Battlezone, movies like Blade Runner and Monty Python's Holy Grail... the music, the Dungeons and Dragons.

B003L77G6A|4.0|This season, the show's producers and writers seemed to have settled into their formula with very little change and direction throughout the season. Leonard and Penny don't get together, they don't break up, and the tension between them pretty much seems to be gone. The only real new element is the introduction of a sort of \\"girlfriend\\" for Sheldon, a girl who's pretty much precisely his female equal. I thought it was a bit strange that the show picked up Sheldon and Amy's relationship mid-stream, bypassing any humor that might have derived from their getting-together, but her presence adds a funny new angle.<br /><br />The show feels lighthearted, predictable and \\"easy\\" this season, but it mostly works. A few episodes may be a bit \\"by the numbers,\\" but most of them were laugh-out-loud funny. You'd think some of the worn-out jokes (Roj being unable to talk around women, Howard's weird Oedipal relationship with his mother) might have been retired by now, but they keep on coming up again and again.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this is fun, geek-friendly comedy television. Viewers who considered the Big Bang Theory formula a bit worn-out by seasons 2 or 3 won't find anything new or revolutionary in this fourth season. If you don't mind a bit of formula stirred into your TV entertainment, this is really clever and enjoyable.
B005MMYL10|4.0|After initially making the mistake of shying away form Spartacus on Starz for a long time thinking it would be a poor man's 300 and of course being absolutely wrong, I chose to give this Starz take on Camelot a try.<br /><br />From the beginning the production values are better than regular tv but not quite as epic as game of thrones and I could see how some could be put off by that but as the series progresses; the characters progress very well really drawing you into the series. Their take on mythical characters was refreshing and definitely more realistic. Perhaps the biggest attraction is Merlin played by Joseph Fiennes. This is no standard Merlin for sure. Completely different \\"bad ass\\" type of Merlin with shaved head, tattoos and cryptic scars all over his body, Fiennes does what he does so well and creates and anti-hero type Merlin. This character is not alone in redefining the mythos of Camelot... King Arthur played by Jamie Campbell does a marvelous job at seeming meek and confused but as the series progresses he manages to play a convincingly heroic Arthur by the end of season. Morgan played by Eva Green was also done quite well. How do I know this? Because though she is amazingly beautiful, you manage to hate her guts as the season progresses. Gawain is an awesome double sward weilding soldier who trains Arthurs knights, Lancelot known as Leontis is probably the only character along with Gawain not straying from the original legend. Leontis tried, true and faithful to his kings oozes nobility loyalty. I can go on and on about all the characters and initially maybe because of ingrained stereo types of Camelot, you are put off by the characters but if you stick to the series, I guarantee you will grow to appreciate them as the spirit of Camelot with twist of reality.<br /><br />Magic is touched on in this series but it is not overt and quite rare. Most of the magic is performed by Morgan but Merlin intentionally does not flaunt or practice because his power is too great to control and addicting so he represses himself but when he does use magic, it is truly powerful sometimes with dire consequences. Morgan also suffers more for this for her constant use of it. Battles are not epic like game of thrones, as a matter of fact battles are quite small with maybe 40 men in the field, and it can become off putting as it seems unrealistic that a kingdom could only be comprised of such small armies. I have to think it was simply budgetary constraints. For what ever reason, Camelot was just not hit like Spartacus was and starz seemed to give up on it. A real shame because it was a refreshing take on myth and the actors were superb with flashes of brilliant acting at times.<br /><br />I enjoyed the series and loved the characters. If you decide to watch the series, give it some time, don't give up on it and it will reward you with some great acting and transformations at the end of the season.is too great to control and addicting so he represses himself but when he does use magic, it is truly powerful sometimes with dire consequences.

B000095IUM|4.0|Beethoven Symphonies 1 - 9. Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the Arnold Schoenberg Choir. With Charlotte Margiono, Rudolf Schasching, Birgit Remmert and Robert Holl. Recorded 1991. Teldec.<br /><br />Harnoncourt's cycle starts off very impressively, aided by superb sound. It is hard to believe that this cycle was recorded live - it has the feel of a spacious studio acoustic. As with Karajan and Solti, Harnoncourt treats the First with just as much vitality and strength as the more mature symphonies: the tempi are solid not rushed and the instruments have a beautiful sheen to them, whilst never sacrificing body. The climaxes are just that - not the trashy bashing of a drum which so often disfigures Norrington's earlier period performances. I particularly liked the middle movements in this recording: the splendid playing is balanced with knife-edged drama and really spot-on tempos. The same is true of the Second: Harnoncourt really makes a dramatic statement about the piece and the result is really electrifying.<br /><br />Undoubtedly any performance of the Eroica will have to bring out its harsh edges at times - especially in the first movement. Harnoncourt particularly excels in those moments - the characterisation of the first two movements is very powerful: dramatic and almost violent without being vulgar. Sometimes more repose is required in the marche funebre, but it all comes off quite nicely - the credit also due to the continued excellent playing of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe.<br /><br />The Fourth does not quite equal the some of its parts. It starts out very beautifully and with a real sense of mystery, but much of it is a bit all over the place. I didn't really feel a cohesive vision. The slow movement was a particular movement - not as beautiful as it can be. Tempos were a bit erratic and the playing less refined than elsewhere in the cycle.<br /><br />The Fifth is certainly a strong performance: tempi are never rushed and you don't feel like the whole thing descends into farce like the one in Norrington's cycle. The superior playing from Harnoncourt's forces also make it streets ahead of Norrington's version. I would probably rate this Fifth in front of Karajan's and Solti's 1970s recordings as well. At times, you might feel that the performance is just a little too hard pressed - but  I don't really object: I think the tension and uplift of that final glorious movement is well caught. What I like is that nothing feels 'clipped' in this version and it is also not rushed - a great boon. Still, it fails to displace Bernstein 1961 as my all time favourite recording of this great work.<br /><br />The Harnoncourt Sixth is another completely satisfying performance. It may be surprising how the first two movements are quite slow. I personally think the pace throughout the symphony is well judged. The central movements are accelerated, but the beauty of the symphony is always foremost. But I wouldn't call it the most dramatic or tense account of this elusive masterpiece. I think Karajan, for all of his detractors in the Sixth, captures those qualities more than any other (except perhaps Bernstein).<br /><br />Harnoncourt exploits every possible dynamic contrast and instrumental detail in the Seventh. It is a richly dramatic reading and the octane level just keeps rising as the symphony moves through its third and fourth movement. The very last, the allegro con brio, is played here better than any other recording I have - the conducting and the playing are simply inspired. For once you feel that everything is just right in this movement and the joy and attraction of this amazing movement is really exploited. Earlier, however, I find that some of the playing is scrappy and the strings thin. Still, it's all quite involving. For period enthusiasts this clearly outmatches the Norrington in every way (as usual).<br /><br />The performance that most strikes me in this cycle is the unassuming Eighth. It is given a marvelous performance here. Whilst the playing isn't as good as that of the Berlin Philharmonic, for example, it makes up for that with a really outlandish account. It is lively and elegant and always surprising.<br /><br />Like the other period performance of this symphony with which I am familiar (the Norrington), this ranks as the low point in Harnoncourt's otherwise solid cycle. It is bland and uninspired, capped off by uninvolved contributions from the four soloists in the finale. It could very well be that this symphony requires something deeper than scholarship and fizzy tempos. These conductors seem to overlook this symphony and treat it like it's just a run-through rather than one of the cornerstones of symphonic literature. For a truly inspired account, one is urged to go to Furtwangler's Bayreuth 'vision' above all, followed closely by Solti and then Karajan in his 1977 account. They convey something of the perfection that this symphony represents.<br /><br />Overall, then, this is quite a good cycle. Originally, I thought it to be rather boring. On second hearing, it strikes you as being quite fresh and spontaneous without sacrificing either nuance or some of the grand old tried and true methods of conventional performance (hence the title of this review). This proves the importance of listening more than once to cycles like these. Unlike Norrington's ghastly approach in many of these works, there is genuine respect and feeling for the spirit of Beethoven in most of the works. With the exception of the Fourth and, more seriously, the Ninth, this cycle is a safe bet for first timers, but an even stronger recommendation for seasoned collectors who have yet to visit the period 'scene'. But because the Ninth is so piecemeal, I couldn't give it a full five star rating. Four stars then.rformance here.

B002AT4K9G|1.0|Seriously, I'm a fan of the franchise.  I loved the original, despite its ridiculousness.  I actually enjoyed the second one, to a far lesser degree, and I really liked the way the rebooted the franchise with `Tokyo Drift'.  I was actually excited to see the original cast come together for this fourth installment.  Sadly, it's a disaster.  I mean, this is barely entertaining.  The premise is far too similar in scope to feel anything remotely enjoyable, and while this sites reviewer wants to tout these thrills as being anything but cheap, I must digress and state that these chills are the epitome of cheap.  They don't illicit anything genuine.  There is a limit to stupidity in a film.  Certain films are crafted to serve the masses a dose of `good time', and I can embrace that on occasion and when done right, but this is far from right.  This is just plain bad.  The acting, the script, the generic feel; everything is atrociously generated.

There is absolutely no resolution by the end of the book and that was very frustrating for me. I also have so many questions concerning the implications of \\"the loop\\" that I guess will forever go unanswered.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Every so often there's this phenomena where something rapidly enters the public eye in some horrendously over-popular way and almost as suddenly there are scores of people criticizing it without having actually experiencing it. That was the case recently with this trilogy, where people in my kink circle were up in arms over how terrible these books are. Judging them as typical romance porn trash or as \\"bondage light.\\"<br /><br />I'd grown tired of pointing out to people the idiocy of talking authoritatively about anything they have no real knowledge on to begin with and decided I would read at least the first book. This isn't the first time I've forced myself to read something I had no interest in actually reading (hello Twilight ) but I do try and read in these circumstances with the same openness of myself I give to every book.<br /><br />To get it out of the way, I don't know what typical romance porn trash looks like, but this was definitely romance porn trash with cheesy names (Anastasia Steele, Christian Grey) or comic book alliterative names (Kate Kavanaugh) it was difficulty to buy-in to the characters. And they are awful characters who send awful messages and progress through actions together that support really awful behavior patterns:<br /><br />The man repeatedly stalks the women in the story; he's extremely jealous, possessive and controlling and the woman acknowledges all of these things as bad behaviors but discourages them by constantly capitulating, finding them charming, nay even romantic. He also consistently ignores her refusals when she cares to give one and instead coerces her capitulation more.<br /><br />Meanwhile, she wants nothing to do with the BDSM aspect of the relationship but capitulates to some of that throughout the book as both a means to an end (her successfully manipulating him into changing into the partner she wants him to be) and because she believes his desires can only be spawned from deep messed up personal trauma. And mostcliched of all, she is correct--the only reason he practices BDSM is because he was horribly abused as an infant and toddler and it's the only way he can connect with someone. He is broken and she needs to fix him. He however does not want fixing and so the book also follows her through a long passage of occasions where she coerces him past his refusals, and showers him with her own insane possessive jealousy.<br /><br />They are both incredibly messed-up opposites trying to force the other to change who they are, so of course they are bound to be perfect for each other (or not--I am not reading the second two books). I found their relationship, on both ends, repugnant.<br /><br />For the BDSM minded people like my friend who complained, without reading, that the books were BDSM light, it involved the following activities: behavioral domination & protocols, financial domination, bare handed spanking, belt spanking, sensory deprivation, a cropping, a flogging, multiple occasions of wrist and/or ankle restraint, coitus in risky locations, rough sex... For some people that is \\"bondage light,\\" for some it's not. If it isn't your kink, there's nothing wrong with it being someone else's. But it does bring me to another critical note:<br /><br />The BDSM play reads like someone researched a bit on the internet and watched a few videos as research and then wrote them into their sex scenes. Negotiations existed for the establishment of their relationship (although they never agreed to them by the end of the book, constantly breaching their oath to do nothing before agreement is met) but almost nothing in place for any of their actual play. Lessons in safety are not covered at all and it isn't until the final sexual scene in the book that he makes a point of making sure she remembers her safe words--while not discussing what they mean or why to use them. After their first time playing, her first time playing ever he completely abandons her within minutes rather than providingany after care. All in all, the BDSM aspect of the book is handled extremely irresponsibly, especially if this series is being touted as an opening into the world of kinky sex for all the vanilla soccer moms and cougars out there.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Its wonderfully done and I would still place it in my favorite book category. Trust me when I say you won't be able to put it down.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|John Le Carr&eacute; spy novels are not simple pot boilers. They are pensive ruminations on betrayal, loyalty, and duty with respect to one's family, friends, colleagues, country, and ideals.<br /><br />When I first heard that a movie adaptation was being made, I simply wondered \\"Why?\\". The definitive 1979 adaptation [[ASIN:B005DXCO94 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]], a TV mini-series, simply can't be improved. And anyway, Oldman looks so different from Alec Guinness's George Smiley that I thought it would ruin the film. Fortunately it doesn't; in fact Oldman makes the movie.<br /><br />Simply from his choice of profession, we know that George Smiley must necessarily do evil things. Alec Guinness's Smiley shows his sinister side only once or twice in the mini-series, for example when he is questioning Ricki Tarr, he gives Tarr a very menacing look as he puts on his glasses.<br /><br />Gary Oldman's George Smiley on the other hand oozes evil. George Smiley does evil because his job requires him to do the dirty work his government and his ideals command him to do. George Smiley does evil because in most cases doing nothing would result in a greater evil. Smiley chooses the lesser evil. No good man can live with this easily. Gary Oldman hardly ever appears kind or gentle. He bullies Connie Sachs with a bottle of whisky. He terrifies Toby Esterhase into tears. When he takes charge of something, he displays no satisfaction at being proven right. It's not generosity, it's simply an absence of any good feeling.<br /><br />I finally realized that Alec Guinness is NOT George Smiley. He comes damn close but Smiley is a far more complex character that can be portrayed by a single actor in a single performance. Oldman does not offer a new interpretation of George Smiley, he presents a different side of the spy master, the necessary evil inner side hidden under the gentler face Guinness showed us.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo
0439023491|5.0|This has to be one of my all-time favorite books. Suzane Collins shaped this series beautifully and the story line always seems to surprise and excite you while staying, well, perfect. If you haven't read any of the Hunger Games books yet, what you need to do is go to the store and buy all three. Your not wasting your money because once you start the first one you'll be happy you saved another trip to the store or a week waiting of shipping for the others. Catching Fire seems to get right back to where it left on in the first one. It's simply put one of the greatest series of this decade.

However, I heard a live version of 'I'm So Afraid' while at a friend's house and it blew me away. The album version hadn't left an impression on me, so I didn't even know what album the original was from. I bought this DVD straightaway, and while the overall concert, for me, was only so-so, I keep rewatching 'I'm So Afraid' because it amazes me with how brilliantly it was done. I became a huge fan of Lindsey Buckingham from what I saw here.

The clarity is amazing, one of the best blu-rays visually that I have seen and a pretty good price for 3D. I don't write many reviews but couldn't believe so many people were giving it such bad ones. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Try this if you like action movies and especially if you like action without lots of blood and gore or are looking for a family friendly action movie for movie night :)

B000BF0D9M|5.0|I don't know a blessed thing about Jesse Cook but was looking for some more flamenco guitar after listening to an old CD of B Tribe recently, so went on the hunt and found this compilation. In short, I get lost in the music. I've done more research into his music and will probably get some of his other CDs. If you like Spanish guitar or just some upbeat guitar in general, then his music is for you. It will transport you to a happy place.
B001J20ZIA|5.0|The Ant Bully is meaningful for a couple different reasons.  One, it shows children that they CAN respond and stand up to bullies despite what they feel is an overwhelming obstacle standing in their way, and two, it shows that it's probably best to show respect for ALL living creatures, even the smallest of insects such as an ant!<br /><br />It's an animated story about a boy who gets picked on by a bully while standing in his front yard one day.  After the bully knocks him to the ground, the boy then gets angry about it, and takes out his revenge on the ants that are building a pretty sizeable nest in his front yard.  Well it turns out the ants are talkative, intelligent, and apparently genius little insects that actually have the ability to turn the little boy into a smaller boy- MUCH smaller, say, the size of an ant!<br /><br />You guessed it right- the ants -despite constantly referring to the boy as a \\"destroyer\\" for the way he eliminates and tortures ants- actually end up helping the boy understand what it's like being the size of an ant and having to deal with the many struggles and the enormous hardships of survival that an ant has to endure on a daily basis.  Well not ALL the ants want to help the boy learn the errors of his ways.  For a while it would seem they'd all like nothing more than to trap and kill the boy, however the one female ant actually feels sorry for the boy and wants to help change him into a more respectful and compassionate person.<br /><br />The story mainly focuses around the adventure that the boy takes the ants on by exploring the grassy lands and avoiding the obstacles in his own yard, so in a way this is like an animated version of Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  You will actually see all the obstacles that ants have to face concerning their predators.  My favorite being the frogs!  WOW, suddenly frogs don't look so innocent and helpless to me anymore, haha!  Let's just say, they have tongues of steel!  Remember this is all done playfully for the kids who are watching the film.<br /><br />Overall, a terrific story with some pretty clever segments (such as the one where the boy and the ants wonder how to get across the carpet in the living room and decide to use flower petals and glide into a fan, which would blow them across the room).  I highly recommend it.

B000001IPP|5.0|This album is literally the perfect punk rock record. Everytime I listen to it I can't help but sing along, because every song is so damn catchy. Some people complain about 23 songs being simply too much, but I think too many songs are better than too little.<br /><br />Buy this album, you won't regret it!

0061969656|2.0|I've enjoyed the Saxon Chronicles series and was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it is weak in plot and feels like it was written more to make money and keep the series alive (to make more money) rather than to actually tell an interesting story. If you've read the earlier books in the series, you've already got a flavor for the period (isn't that the point of a historical novel)and this volume doesn't add anything to that. In fact, in this volume the characters are even less believable. I'm very skeptical that I will want to read the next volume in the series, even if I was somehow to get it for free.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun and very entertaining love how the game just throws in the random disasters and stuff, you never know what's going to be next to either help you or destroy stuff. Fur fun fun way to waste some time.
B0006B2A42|5.0|The sixties produced some edge-of-your-seat Cold War flicks like Fail Safe, The Bedford Incident and Ice Station Zebra. As an earlier reviewer wrote, there's something about this movie that grabs you.  Even my wife, who's totally uninterested in movies like this, will watch it.  Why does it work?  First, the acting is good. All main stars do a great job with standouts Hudson and McGoohan.  Though a long movie (intermissions were common in fifties and sixties movies) it is paced well and oscillates crisply  between scenes of suspense, action and one-on-one scenes between the players. A first class editing job.  The scene where the submarine is sabotaged and nearly sinks is terrifically done.  I saw this movie in a theatre when it first ran and was blown away by the big sound effects. The crushing ice flows, the roaring of the fighter planes, the whine of the submarine turbines. It all makes for a powerful impact.  I can see why Howard Hughes played it over and over.  When is it coming out in BluRay??
0316017930|4.0|This writer is amazing. He can condense lengthy studies and dull data into poignant and compelling prose. I have read several of his books, and I can't believe how much I enjoy reading them! I feel like I learn a lot, and they really make me think. Outliers in particular made me question a lot of what I thought I knew. As a school counselor, the success of others is extremely important to me, and this changed the way I think about that. Great read!

1442419814|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, as well as the other books in the series. I felt like the plot was believable, the characters interesting and well-developed, and the writing very fluid and compelling. This book explores some difficult issues and inspires a lot of thought about what beauty means, and how important we make it. There is a little romance, enough to keep it interesting without being Twilight-y. I also appreciated that there was not the violence factor, which made The Hunger Games repulsive to me.<br />This book, and the rest of them, were keep-me-up-late reads, and I love that!

B000SEIK2S|5.0|Readers, if you are going to read Scalzi, make sure you have done your apprenticeship and read Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" first, and Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\" immediately after. Why? Because with Heinlein you get the whole socio-political, war-machine glorification, and with Haldeman it is very much the opposite. Both are insanely engaging. Enough said about those two.<br /><br />Scalzi, by his own admission, pays homage to these and other greats in his writing, but this guy is witty; I mean really witty. His writing almost leaks  arrogance in the way it immerses and taunts the reader.<br /><br />Scalzi pushes the reader's buttons with the consummate ease of a writing professional.<br /><br />I read \\"Old Man's War\\" very quickly, my 21 year old son saw the first two pages on my Android and immediately Kindled it for himself. Cross generational appeal.<br /><br />If you want a novel that will grip and entertain you, then \\"Old Man's War\\" is for you.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|While I enjoyed the series I found that it was ultimately a rather depressing story, but an incredibly relevant political/historical one.  I find myself taken aback by the current obsession with the series, especially given it's incredibly violent undertones.  I am also somewhat concerned that it is classified as young adult literature, as I think it might be too mature for younger readers.  While I would recommend it to others, I would certainly advise parents whose children are reading this novel to have a discussion as to the political and societal implications of what is happening in the story.  That said, it's much more realistic as to character development and feelings than one usually finds in a fantasy/science fiction novel.  The characters are flawed and present a wide range of human emotions which evolve over time due to the circumstances to which they're subjected.  The author does not shy away from the cruelties and realities of the human conditions and the horrible lows they are capable of, I do however wish there were more of the incredible highs included as well.

In this one the reader actually has to \\"do\\" something (sometimes many things) each day and it can be challenging to keep up with it every day, especially on difficult or extremely busy days.  If you can stick with it, however, it is very powerful and life changing.  It is a book you can read and re-read over and over to continue to make gratitude a part of your life, kind of like breathing.

B00004W510|5.0|Well, since so many have already written such superb reviews and analytical essays on this album, I must say straight that my only excuse in adding my two cents here is that this being such a favourite of mine and having reviewed other favourites of mine on Amazon, I feel a kind of obligation to myself...<br />Sorry for the long prelude; here I go:<br /><br />With my 'Music From Big Pink' review I focused on how great the addition of the bonus tracks are. Since this isn't so much the case here(although they're interesting and it's worth hearing the studio version of 'Get Up Jake') I shall have to work the main feature; the album: It's perfect, really, no matter how you look at it. Probably even from a mathematical perspective.<br />Big Pink, their first album and masterpiece, is equally perfect but what is interesting is that although the production and consistency of song and sound is so exquisitly captured on The Band(or \\"Brown Album\\") and 'Big Pink' is quite raw and sprawling(part of its beauty) it doesn't, in my opinion, supersede or top their debut; it cements it really.<br /><br />Their trademark switching of vocals and instruments works to stunning effect on both and the timeless warmth and aching soul runs particularly rampant through the first two albums like a benevolent musical virus, but on their second we really see the alchemy full-frontal and clear as a sunny Autumn day in the woods.<br />I don't know of many bands that can mix around the duties of their personnel so often and yet keep the personality of the group sound and identity so completely intact:<br />Levon might switch to mandolin while Manuel flaps about on the drums; Garth shows the world that, yes, he can also play the rag-time piannie like he invented it; Danko scratches out a beautifully raw violin riff, besides his air-shifting bass and Robbie writes a perfect song as any while playing guitar like a groovy scientist; then they'll play musical chairs again and we'll be blessed with a ballad so gorgeous from Richard Manuel that we would drink it too, if we could, while weeping tears of poignant joy.<br /><br />It is commonly stated that there was a particularly 'woody' sound to the drums on this album, and that analogy can probably be expanded to describe the overall sound of it; grainy, earthy... you know: rustic. But there is not a note out of place; not a sloppy or lazy moment to behold. It is mastery of the form... but what form? Folk, Blues, Country, Soul, Rock 'n' Roll... Americana?<br />The Band.lad so gorgeous from Richard Manuel that we would drink it too, if we could, while weeping tears of poignant joy.<br /><br />It is commonly stated that there was a particularly 'woody' sound to the drums on this album, and that analogy can probably be expanded to describe the overall sound of it; grainy, earthy... you know: rustic.

B00792EGES|4.0|I am a die-hard fan, and live by their Amsterdam DVD/Blu-ray release.  The sound and picture quality of this Blu-ray are unmatched.  With that said, here are my issues:<br /><br />1.) Slow down! The band feels the need to speed up the tempo of songs that were originally recorded at a much slower tempo.  This causes them to sound a bit jumbled live, and Myles loses breath just slightly. 'Find The Real' and 'Slip To The Void', two of my favorites, encompass this.  Both are great songs, both sound good live, but I wish they would have played them at the right tempo.<br /><br />2.) How 'bout some different songs? Live at Wembley includes a handful of songs off AB III. The older ones left a lot to be desired, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong; they sounded great.  But they should have performed some songs that weren't on the Amsterdam release. I didn't particularly care to hear 'Come to Life, 'Ties That Bind', and 'Broken Wings' again. AB has some great songs that are underrated and not included on EITHER release -- 'Wayward One', 'Burn It Down' (one of my faves), 'Down To My Last', 'Shed My Skin', 'The End Is Here'; as well as AB III's 'Still Remains', 'Make It Right', 'Show Me A Sign', 'Words Darker Than Their Wings', etc...<br /><br />3.) Swearing. I'm not the first reviewer to note this, but I feel it bears repeating. I am by no means a prude, but unexplained f-bombs in random places make Myles sound ridiculous and takes away from the experience. Plus, you can't let your kids watch it...and I'd rather my kids appreciate good rock music instead of Nicki Minaj or Adele.
B0050PYNN0|1.0|Despite all its potential, efforts of lavish special effects, slew of highly talented actors and even seemingly promising trailers, `Your Highness' fails miserably on absolutely every level imaginable, competing with even the Transformers sequels and Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer parody movies (truly ghastly comparisons) for worst movie ever. Hopefully the Razzies are taking notes.<br /><br />Although I shouldn't have to explain the plot (because no one should ever, by any means, see this movie if given the choice), I will anyway for clarity's sake. Set in medieval times, Thadeous (Danny McBride) and his brother Fabious (James Franco) are both the sons of King Tallious and warriors expected to defend their kingdom from evil. While Fabious is beloved by the kingdom and excels in combat, however, Thadeous is lazy, arrogant and more known for his lust for women than slaying any villains. One day Fabious saves the virgin Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel) from a tower, where she was held captive by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux). Upon bringing her home to marry her, however, Leezar appears and kidnaps her again, attempting to fulfill a prophecy of a warlock impregnating a maiden with a fearsome dragon to attack the kingdom. Random chaos ensues, but trust me when I say there's no need for any explanation beyond that.<br /><br />The film is bogged down by nauseating toilet humor, atrocious writing and juvenile, unfunny gags (unless you're under the age of 15 or a heavily inebriated frat boy, you absolutely won't be laughing once). It also really can't seem to decide what it wants to be; given the blatant tone of the trailers (and opening scenes), you'd expect that the entirety of the film would be a comedy/medieval parody (or at least an attempt at one) along the lines of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This is only halfway the case, as the movie makes sporadic pleas to be taken seriously, or maybe just desperately hopes to systematically distract viewers from the fact that the `comedy' is gag-inspiringly godawful. These embarrassing attempts at grounded plot are the most laughable moments in the movie.<br /><br />In a particularly foul scene, the grotesque, pedophilic `Great Wise Wizard' (a bizarre Yoda-looking creature) insists that Fabious and Thadeous give him kisses and then a handjob (viewers are subjected to both). Thadeous also spends several minutes toward the end of the film sporting a minotaur's severed penis as a necklace (as if viewer's palettes aren't in need of enough cleansing by that point). How on earth the likes of James Franco and Natalie Portman of all people didn't have anything better to do is beyond me.<br /><br />It's such an utter waste, really and truly, especially considering the genuinely impressive CGI effects in the final scenes. Given the trite material they have to work with, it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that even the handful of supremely talented cast members can't save this atrocity. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it is absolutely not worth a single person on this earth's time. Buzz Killington should clearly stick to Family Guy cameos, because buzzkill \\"comedy\\" leaves such a nasty aftertaste.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Blu-ray Review<br /><br />Year: 2011<br />Rating: R<br />Runtime: 2 HR 38 MIN<br /><br />Director: David Fincher<br />Starring: Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgård, Steven Berkoff, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson, and Goran Visnjic<br /><br />Film: 5 out of 5<br />Video: 5 out of 5<br />Audio: 4 out of 5<br />Extras: 5 out of 5<br />Overall: 5 out of 5<br /><br />The Film-<br /><br />David Fincher has directed several of my favorite films of the last twenty years but he's had almost as many misses as he has hits. The Game, Panic Room, and The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button are technically impressive films that I wouldn't qualify as bad but I rarely feel the need to revisit. On the other hand Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac are films that I can watch repeatedly and take away something new on every viewing. Somehow I still haven't seen The Social Network so I can't speak to its successes or failures but I can unequivocally say that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will be another Fincher film that I will visit often for years to come.<br /><br />Investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has just lost a libel case for an \\"unflattering\\" article he wrote which has put him in and his publisher in financial ruin. Mikael is summoned to a meeting with Henrik Vanger, a wealthy businessman. Henrik presents him with the opportunity to investigate the suspected murder of his niece Harriet almost forty years ago. It soon becomes clear that he is in over his head and needs a second pair of eyes to piece together the mystery. Mikael's employer puts him in contact with Lisbeth, a skilled investigator with a personality as unique as her dragon tattoo.<br /><br />To describe this film as dark doesn't do it justice. The world that Mikael and Lisbeth inhabit is bleak, filled with unsavory characters in both the past and present. Mikael's investigation at first glance may look like the film's main focus but it's actually Lisbeth's story that drives The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Her story is weaved throughout Mikael's investigation and while that storyline is more of a procedural her story carries the emotional arc of the story. The film turns convention on its ear by making the strongest character the woman even though because of her circumstances is repeatedly victimized.<br /><br />There are disturbing scenes that will make you squirm and feel uncomfortable; the flip side of that coin is that it's riveting and those scenes payoff in spades later. Fincher never glorifies the violence, but he doesn't shy away from it either. He lets it play out naturally and doesn't edit away the horror; he forces you to look away by just letting the camera roll.<br /><br />While I haven't read the Stieg Larsson novels or seen the original Swedish film to compare to this film I was completely engulfed by Steve Zaillian's script. I purposely avoided the novel and films leading up to the release of the US version so I wouldn't be comparing and contrasting it against its other incarnations. Zaillain's script doesn't fall prey to the pitfalls that usually doom American adaptations such as ham-handedly explaining to the audience what the morale of the story is or tacking on a \\"Hollywood\\" ending to an otherwise good film.<br /><br />David Fincher's team has created an enveloping world that made Sweden feel like its own character. Every shot looks stunning and continues to show why Fincher has one of the best set of eyes in the industry. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' moody score blur the line between a conventional film score and something more in tune with rock music. The score is like plugging a pair of headphones into Lisbeth's brain and listening to her internal struggle put to music.<br /><br />All the performances are simply fantastic which isn't unexpected considering what he's been able to do with Brad Pitt (\\"What's in the box!?\\") Even though Daniel Craig gets top billing Rooney Mara is the star and she's simply fantastic. As I mentioned earlier, some horrible things happen to Lisbeth's character and she completely sold me on her portrayal by going all out in her performance. As usual Daniel Craig was very good as well; his character isn't given as much to go through but his performance is still very good. The always great Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård also bring \\"A\\" game performances and an elder statesmen touch to the film. Christopher Plummer finally won an Academy Award this year for his role in Beginners but he could have easily won it for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as well.<br /><br />This is about as close to a perfect film as you're going to find in this day and age. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart. You may see things that you may not want to see but this qualifies as a film where the juice is definitely worth the squeeze.<br /><br />The Disc-<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is housed inside a cardboard case inside of a cardboard sleeve. I found it difficult to pull the case from the sleeve which has caused the corners of the inside case to look dented and worn. Inside the cardboard case you'll find three discs; one Blu-ray featuring the film, a second Blu-ray with all the special features, and a third disc that is simply a DVD/UltraViolet Digital Copy. If you're a fan of disc art you'll love the artwork or lack thereof on the DVD copy; it simply looks like a standard Sony brand DVD-R with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sloppily written across the front which feels quite appropriate for the film<br /><br />In terms of video and audio quality Sony has turned in almost a perfect disc. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was shot digitally using a combination of the Red Epic and Red One cameras. The film presentation is flawless; there's not a trace of banding or edge enhancement and black levels are perfectly inky. None of this is a surprise since all of David Fincher films with the exception of The Game and Panic Room have received amazing transfers on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless soundtrack offers up an extremely engaging experience from the moment the film begins with the James Bond-esque opening sequence. While the film isn't overly action oriented that doesn't mean that the surrounds channels don't create an enveloping experience. Directionality isn't gimmicky but everything from the busy subways to the wind whipping through the frozen woods comes alive. Dialogue is well balanced and is always intelligible which is important because if you were to miss something you could find yourself rewinding. If the soundtrack falters in any way it's in terms of bass which I found to be overpowering. At one point I had to turn down the volume of my entire system because I was concerned about blowing my subwoofers.<br /><br />Disc One's only special feature is the audio commentary by David Fincher.

B007FH9GT2|2.0|The only thing this movie showed me is full blown body tattos on what's her name probably has a emotional personality disorder or some other psychological issue.<br /><br />The film was very slow, fragmented and could barely hear the lines. In summary: boring. I rather watch reruns of Andy Griffith Show.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl has been on my to do read list for a month or so. I have about a million on there, so when something jumps out and says buy me buy me nowww!! It means something. I came across the book on a book blog, and was attracted to the cover and the trailer, which were very well produced. The main character, in an dramatic black outfit, had pretty cool style. I also was drawn to the main character Sophia, who in the free sample I read, turned out to be waitress ( a job I've just ended), Wiccan ( a spirituality that I am), and feisty when pressured to convert by random Christians (can relate). I didn't know much about what would happen next, but it sure had a good start.<br /><br />I had no idea what came next and so I am loath to ruin it for you. Needless to say, if you like magic, rituals, creative configurations of superhuman species, fire, history, and the like, you will like this book. Some of these themes are in my own manuscript, too, which was a cool surprise. I thought the writing was tight, the characters well thought out, the settings described wonderfully. Throughout the novel, sprinklings of elegant narrative grace the page, the moon above was stitched in the sky, a lusty mans 'interest' pressed against Sophia's thigh. Yes, tell me more beautiful things please. Looking forward to book two!<br /><br />see more reviews on my blog [...]

You can really learn a lot about shapes like cars and buildings, it's fantastic and really sets up a great foundation. Young children will develop an awareness of the world around them, at least that's what I found when I think back on this book. Simple, easy, and an abundance of room for creativity. The how to's are so short you spend more time using your imagination than trying to copy the pictures. I have little recollection of the coloring books and other things I used when I was little but this book I remember very vividly, it was so helpful and fun that I kept taking it off the shelf long after I needed to.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|So much has been said in praise of this superb adaptation, there's not much to add.<br /><br />Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros in HBO's medieval fantasy adapted from George R. R. Martin's best-selling series A Song of Ice and Fire for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.  Lena Headey, Jack Gleeson, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean star along with new faces, all of whom wonderfully inhabit the warring clans - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and noblemen - in the two mighty families who vie for power in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros where summers span decades and winters can last a lifetime.<br /><br />The seductive ten episodes that cover the first book in the on-going series, which is still being written, is a visually rich, sweeping epic and arguably the best thing on TV right now.  If this is new to you, prepare to be hooked and engaged as betrayal, lust, intrigue and supernatural forces shake the four corners of the Kingdoms in a bloody battle for the Iron Throne, the outcome of which has unforeseen and far-reaching consequences.  The cliff-hanging ending will prime you for Season Two.

The author includes lots of shortcuts and alternatives that can accommodate almost any diet, and the recipes are delicious. Highly recommended!
B006ISJQBM|4.0|Director Bruce Robinson adapted the screenplay from Hunter S. Thompson's eponymous debut novel that was in turn kind of based on some of his own alcohol and drug-fueled experiences in Puerto Rico.  Johnny Depp was a friend of Thompson and vowed to him that they would make the movie.  Depp honored that promise and a director's chair embossed with Thompson's name that held a bottle of Rum on the canvas seat was always on the set.  I enjoyed Depp's somewhat toned down performance, as his character gets embroiled with greedy developers, crooked politics, journalism, and voodoo - oh, there's his dangerous obsession with an entrepreneur's woman.  The movie's heart is really about Thompson finding his unique journalist voice, and this film is a fitting tribute to that and a fine epitaph to him.  Aaron Eckhart, Richard Jenkins and Amber Heard costar.

B004LWZW8S|1.0|One brave warrior, graced by the gods, must overcome enormous odds to save mankind from a mighty and merciless tyrant in the Tarsem Singh directed epic tale of vengeance and destiny.  The plot has power-crazed King Hyperion threatening to destroy all humanity in his maniacal quest to obtain the legendary Epirus Bow, an ultimate weapon that can unleash war on both Heaven and Earth.  The sometimes visually compelling but weakly told story -- the screenwriters are Vlas and Charles Parlapanides -- is a cutting-edge melding of practical sets and finely honed CG work.  The effective cast includes: Henry Cavill, Luke Evans, Kellan Lutz, Isabel Lucas, Stephen Dorff, John Hurt and Mickey Rourke.  The combo Blu-ray pack features an Alternate Beginning and two Alternate Endings, Behind the Scenes, Deleted Scenes, as well as a 3-D version.<br /><br />But that said, this is a horrendous fail on all levels.  The flamboyantly silly costumes, the gilded sets and over-wrought dialogue made me think that at any moment the short skirted warriors in their sparkly costumes were going to line up to do synchronized high kicks to a big show tune dance  number.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|What's not to love. Its game of thrones. One of the best book series every written and expertly brought to life by HBO.
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|It has been called gloriously sick, twisted and disturbing.  BATTLE ROYALE is a title that thrilled and unnerved audiences with a fiendishly simple premise that has inspired many imitations including THE HUNGER GAMES.  Based on the 1999 global best seller by Koushun Takami, the futuristic tale first came to the big screen in 2000.  When Kinji Fukasaku unleashed his violently poetic epic about an innocent group of Junior High students forced by the government to hunt and kill their classmates for sport, it not only launched a global phenomenon and was nominated for 10 Japanese Academy Awards but also was at the same time banned from screens by frightened civic groups including distributors across America.  Three years later an equally disturbing sequel triggered its own firestorm.  This high-end package of BATTLE ROYALE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION is a four disc set that includes theatrical and director's cuts as well a Japanese language versions and Bonus Content.
B0037A4ILC|3.0|This review will be useful to that segment of potential purchasers of the film who became interested in it because it is not only about a famous (though doomed) mountain-climbing expedition but also because it is (indirectly) about the Third Reich. This specific segment for which I am reviewing the film wishes to see something positive about that period in the film. (It is relevant also that I, though an American, have lived in the Alps myself, I speak both fluent High German and also Austrian alpine dialect, and I majored in German at Georgetown. Further, I have extensive mountain-hiking experience....but not in mountain \\"climbing\\" -- with pitons, ropes, etc., for I have never had a subliminal death wish, and when you see this film you may end up agreeing with my remark.)<br /><br />It is a typical West German movie (and I say West German deliberately, because West Germany simply ate East Germany, illegally, in 1990, and imposed on the whole country obsessive anti-Nazism. Every year, in that supposed German democracy, thousands are arrested for peacefully saying anything at all positive about the period 1933-45.) And so it is \\"de rigeur\\" in this film (as well as all the other West German films) to consistently portray National Socialists as totally sinister, extremely uncool, and latently monstrous....just waiting to holocaust someone In this film, they add for good measure an obese, cynical, large-nosed and black-haired Jew, who criticizes the whole expedition to one and all as insanely dangerous. The Jew is shown as being the one wise man in the whole crew of Eiger onlookers.<br /><br />Even the blue-eyed lead actress Wokalek is forced to wear brown contact lenses, because cool people do not look Aryan! That is how ridiculously tendentious and lecturing this film is on the one hand.<br /><br />I think I should also say, without giving the ending away entirely, that it sticks to the fundamental historical facts ....at least about how the real expedition truly ended, which was in an extreme and searing tragedy. Do not expect an American-style \\"happy ending\\" at all, for the truth is there was no happy ending. But somehow even this ending is subtly blamed on the Third Reich, as if Hitler had pushed those men up the north face of the Eiger.... No, alpinists for decades have attempted these sorts of perilous climbs -- dreaming of testing their skill, bravery and determination under the most daunting conditions -- and they have done so without Adolf Hitler and on a regular basis. Hitler certainly did not encourage Mallory to climb Everest in the 1920s (who perished) nor Hillary in the 1950s (who succeeded). Dozens have perished on Everest or K-2, but I suppose some day we will get a film about how every man who died on those peaks also was killed by Adolf Hitler...(Just a day before this review was written, even his parents' grave in Austria was dug up at the insistence of Austrian leftists!)<br /><br />On a positive note, the film \\"North Face,\\" reflecting the eternal German obsession with technical quality, is well-done in its breathtaking film work. You get a powerful sense of the majesty and danger of such a climb.<br /><br />But if you hate Nazis (how brave of you to conform with what the media tells you from cradle to grave) and you love politically correct films where Germans are doomed for \\"following Hitler,\\" and you welcome blue-eyed people getting brown contact lenses inserted in their eyeballs so as to avoid looking Aryan, then, for you, I would give the film four stars. Then you will like this film, and be subtly happy that it ended in a disaster.d, which was in an extreme and searing tragedy.

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Perhaps the best drama of 2011, this prescient story of apocalyptic doom is almost Biblical in the way it posits serious mental challenges with the mundane concerns of family survival.  Writer director Jeff Nichols has a terrific ear for ordinary dialogue that masks deep conflict and his eye for composition is just right.  Michael Shannon is the heartland American dad with the disturbing visions and deaf daughter.  Jessica Chastain is his loving and concerned wife.  Both actors are at the top of their game as they play out the possibilities of living with madness or getting treatment<br />-- and then having to decide what's real in their fractured world.  Sometimes, the existential terrors of existence are dreams come true.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|After their Sound of Madness album, which was amazing as well, I was skeptical they could match what they did with that album. Well after listening to this album a few times over I can without question say that not only is this album better than their last, I think it needs to be among the discussion of one of the best albums ever. I can't skip any of the tracks of this album as all the songs range from great to ridiculously amazing. Mostly feel good powerful rock here, but the heavy stuff is there too. If you are on the fence about this album, then just listen to the single Bully and if you think that song is amazing, then understand that song isn't even one of the better songs.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app that I've used so far!  It has multiple Bible versions, written in multiple languages AND... so many choices of Bible Studies.  You can go light & just read a few verses each day, as a Daily Devotional, or get extreme, and read the entire Bible in a designated amount of time.  What I really enjoy, is sometimes my eyes are tired & I don't feel like reading, I can choose to have the app read for me. Awesome attribute!<br />This App can be customized to provide your Bible study & also daily reminders via e-mail.<br /><br />The Only BAD thing about this App... is it's so Easy & Accommodating,  that you Don't  have any Good Excuse, NOT to try it!!!

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I found this book rather unexpectedly yesterday while I was on msn and it advertised a list<br />of 10 must read romances and this series was listed first.  I read book 1 yesterday and book 2<br />today and don't wish to read the third book.  I will admit they are addicting initially but after<br />book 2 I can safely say I am not intrigued by this story.  As a woman in her 30s, I enjoy a good romance.<br />But these books are completely disturbing. I do understand now that you can substitute Edward<br />and Bella for these characters in many ways but these books are getting harder to read and<br />relate to at all.<br /><br />First of all, you can't believe this relationship between these two people being of a lasting<br />type. Any person will leave a relationship, whether it is romantic, familial or friendship etc.<br />if they find that they can't be themselves.  Anastasia isn't herself with Christian, it is a version<br />of herself but not herself. She isn't comfortable, they are both terrified of each other<br />and of revealing who they are.  How can this be love until you know someone and love them<br />despite everything? And the graphic scenes actually aren't romantic after a while, they actually<br />become a physical act and I found myself skipping those because I was turned off by it.<br />This relationship is so complicated on so many different levels these two kids, yes, the girl<br />is in her early 20s and the guy in his late 20s, can't possibly make this work. There are too<br />many things they have to confront and work out in themselves before they could even begin to share<br />of themselves in a real way with each other.<br /><br />I am appalled by the abusive and controlling quality of the male protagonist.  He basically wants<br />a slave to do his bidding - these parts are really hard to read. Sure, there is something in women<br />that wants to be protected and cared for by a good man and something in a man that wants to provide<br />for and be nurtured by a woman - it speaks to something quite primal in us perhaps, but each wants<br />to be free to be who they are and loved for it.  Anything that is controlling is ultimately suffocating<br />so it is hard to believe this story could have a lasting quality to it. It is too unbelievable<br />on so many levels, you are left rolling your eyes as to what kind of story is this.<br /><br />It isn't a badly written story, it is a badly written concept of what true love and relationship entails,<br />am I as a reader to believe this relationship is going to be successful? Oh goodness. One look<br />at real life and you know you are reading not only a fictional story, but a fictional relationship.<br />Two people are being asked to not be who they really are, that can last for a little while, but not<br />forever.

B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I don't know how to go about writing a review for this show. There is no way to explain it, it is just something you need to see. It must be watched in order though or else it won't make as much sense.<br />If you are one of those annoying individuals who are easily offended and are unable to be a normal person then you probably shouldn't watch this.

B006OV7S1I|4.0|\\"Martha...\\" is a good film although I have a hard time recommending it to people. With a run time of about an hour and forty minutes, watching it felt like an exhausting two and a half hours. So why did I like it? Well for starters, I really like John Hawkes. He always gives a strong performance. Elizabeth Olsen did a great job as well. Lastly, and what will stick with me the most is the writing, editing and directing of the film's psychological aspects. Their portrayal of brainwashing and cult mentality. Also the resulting distortion of morals and the abandonment of normal ethics. Yeah, it's not a happy film yet I won't forget it anytime soon.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|How good can a movie named \\"Troll Hunter\\" be, really?  Apparently, pretty darn good.  The acting is good, the visual effects are decent, the plot is... well, troll hunting... but it's good.

B004HW7JH4|4.0|Creator and writer Matthew Weiner did a good job laying the groundwork and story lines for what may yet prove to be an excellent season.  Naturally, one cannot achieve top speed in any endeavor immediately, nor would it be dramatically effective to do so.  Give Matthew a chance.  I am sure he will take the main characters in interesting directions soon enough.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished The Hunger Games. I had a hard time putting it down. I throughly enjoyed it. I now want to see the movie.
B005HEI61Y|4.0|It may be true, as the other reviewer has stated, that this episode has no relevance to the Xindi arc of the season but it does follow in the tradition of every Star Trek series in that there has always been one if not more episodes in which the crew goes back in time for nothing more than needing an entertaining story. I would say that this episode, however, is interesting in that it is not necessarily a \\"back in time\\" episode but rather a glimpse into the past. It follows a simple premise of alien abduction that leads to human overthrowing of said aliens and subsequently living life as if it still were the 19th century. There have been far worse episodes in my opinion up till this point in the series and in my opinion was a pleasant respite from the same \\"cat and mouse\\" escapades each previous episode has followed thus far.
141690977X|5.0|Love this book! It's awesome and REAL! My entire life, I've had the same routine with men. I like them, we flirt and talk, but they never make a move. They act wishy washy and lukewarm at times and then flirty at other times and in the end they never pursue anything real with me. I used to be that girl who came up with every excuse in the book as to why the guy didn't make a movie including the infamous \\"he's shy\\" line that all these pissed off guys on here writing reviews seem to be spitting out. Except I told myself \\"he's intimidated by me\\" or he's not ready for a relationship, lol and in every one of those situations, a few weeks or months down the line, I'd find out this same guy got himself a girlfriend who'd he'd be all \\"baby\\" this and \\"baby\\" that with and I'd be sitting their confused as to what happened. Where was that romantic, affectionate and emotionally available guy when I was trying to get with him? I'm with the book, I think guys make up stupid excuses as to why he doesn't ask a girl out but he likes to keep you flirting and talking with him as an ego booster and amusement! If he's in to you, and you're flirting back with him giving him the green light, then he should find some excuse to hang around you in a social setting just like us women do when we're in to a guy!

1594203334|5.0|I am a young professional dreaming about the day that I will be a mom. I am so glad that I came across this book, because it gave me a ton of things to think about as far as what my identity should (and can!) be as a mom, what kinds of guidelines I want to put in place for my kids, and how to view my child as a \\"tiny human being.\\" The author does not give you a handbook to babies (like other \\"American-style\\" parenting books do), instead, I can imagine her as a mentor who gives good advice and leaves it to her reader to sort through and decide what will be a priority.<br /><br />The writing style of this book is refreshing and easy to follow with some parts that made me laugh out loud. I can appreciate her research, but she puts it into a context that is both personal and relevant. It's conversational yet professional. I bought this book on my kindle and plan to re-read it again (probably several times between now and having kids!) and will be marking it up with my own highlights and notes. I don't think I even want to read any other parenting books! This book is sufficient for me. I highly recommend it, especially to women who are pregnant or don't have kids yet, because it gives you a chance to internalize some of the information. Overall, this is possibly one of the best Kindle purchases I've made in a long while!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app has replaced my alarm clock.  I love it. I really like the fact that I can have a reliable wand portable alarm that looks great on my desk.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This book it about a young women lost after the death of her mother and short stint with drugs and men.  She wants to find herself and escape her current situation. So she embarks upon the PCT with little training or money.  She goes into detail about her relationship with her mother and how things led her to this point in her life. Once on the trail she has many great stories to share from the other hikers and animals she encounters to the crazy weather and at times lack of food water and money.  She is very honest in her writing and doesn't hold any detail back. I fell in love with her and was cheering her on through out the book.  At the end I almost cried partly because I was done reading and partly for her.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|Production values, writing, historical accuracy, character arc, humor, and imagination--Mad Men still has it all. It's one of the few series--the only one, now that I think about it--that we watch faithfully. I loved the season's first episode and am relieved they haven't done anything stupid--miraculous given TV executives' penchant for forcing deadly changes for budget reasons by a successful series' fourth or fifth seasons. Kudos to Weiner for standing his ground.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lot's of fun. great games to pass the time when you are sitting around the house or at the office .  I have had lots of fun with these games.
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|I was interested in downloading this app. Sounds like a cute game. However, OpenFeint is a deal breaker. Thus no download. Disappointing.
B005HSL626|5.0|I loved this game. It's my favorite app. I like this because it never gets boring. I constantly get new scores on all the types (Zen, classic, and arcade). And I never have to give up on it. there is always a challenge waiting when I go on.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I'm not big on reviewing products, though I read reviews religiously. However I did feel it was necessary to chime in after the author himself tweeted back to me (with a \\"yourule\\" hashtag nonetheless).<br /><br />I was recently asked to work on social media for a side project and agreed but realized after reading this book how little I do in fact know about the matter. This book guides readers through the basics with easy-to-understand language and step-by-step instructions on how to improve likeability within a company. I particularly enjoyed reading about the many missteps some companies have taken and how others have redeemed themselves to the consumer. It was interesting to see how easy it is to gain followers (something I would like to do for my blog) and create a voice and strong presence that listens to its customers (something I'm hoping to achieve for this side project).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about social media. My hats off to Dave Kerpen for a fine read. One quick suggestion: I found \\"Likeable Social Media\\" to be heavy on the Facebook and light on the Twitter (which is Narnia to me). Any chance we could include more info on this in a subsequent book? Thanks!
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I attempted to use the dongle for playing video from iPad 3 to hdtv.  It gave a \\"This accessory not supported\\" message.

Apparently, there is a newer version of the connector that works fine with iPad 3:  MD098ZM/A.

0439023513|3.0|I have to say, I loved the first two but this one just really made me angry.  I guess this series is aimed at a younger crowd, but the writing is so unintelligent sometimes (in all three books, not just this one).  At least in the first two books the action was very interesting and pretty fast-paced.  In the Mockingjay, there just seems to be a lot of unnecessary rambling on Collins' part.<br /><br />This book was okay, but I found myself getting very frustrated at the end and just ended up skipping whole paragraphs that I thought were completely irrelevant.  The end felt very rushed, like she was squeezing a whole bunch of information into one spot.  I wish she took the time to develop certain things that happen in the end more.  Instead, there's a lot of wasted space spent talking about what Katniss is thinking and feeling at EVERY point in the book.  It's hard to focus on what's going on when I have to read 2 full pages about how Katniss is feeling.<br /><br />I just thought this wasn't a particularly interesting, clever, or pleasing book.  As one reviewer mentioned, I wish she had a little more faith in the intelligence of her readers, because even when I was a teenager, or twelve for that matter, I wouldn't have needed all the unnecessary explanations to help me understand the morals of the book.  With that said, obviously if you've read the first two you're going to read this one.  Just be prepared to be disappointed, or at least be prepared for a change of pace.
B007E73MSY|5.0|Really liked this album, very hard and heavy without the a lot of the groove stuff. If you liked Dark Age then you'll like this. Probably my most favorite Soulfly release, with my favorite songs Treachery, Chains, Resistance  and Slave.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant continues to produce excellent albumns.  It is fun to watch his career evolve and change and this albumn is another great piece of art he has produced on his journey.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Visual style of the film is gorgeous, and the digital effects are impressive. Literally jaw droppingly beautiful backdrops and production design at points. Probably looks amazing on Blu-Ray, and at $9.99, might even be worth picking up. Core issue with this film is that Jude Law lacks the edge of a Harrison Ford or Daniel Craig and comes across as more of a romantic hero than action hero. Gwyneth Paltrow is passable as is Giovanni Ribisi, but Angelina Jolie is pretty one dimensional. Plot is typical popcorn entertainment fare, but the pacing is pretty spot on and there are several terrific action sequences. Worth a watch.
0316098329|3.0|This book is written from the tongue and thoughts of a 5 year old. It takes time to adjust to the language but eventually you get used to it. It's a well written book, probably based on something from real life, but it can be depressing.  Not recommended as a \\"beach\\" read but good if you want to get  a perspective on someone's life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it goes great on kindel except a lot of the downloaded to get free points to unlock games are through tootle play and with out rooted kindel its hard to get some buy this at all ages its hard and fun and trust me its not just for kids I'm 26 and it was hard for me
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the trilogy in less than a week! Such a fast read, I couldn't put it down. Its a great story
B004EPZ03O|3.0|I love the Muppets. Loved the weekly show and especially Muppets Treasure Island. I wanted The Muppets to be a hilarious, witty movie. What I saw was ok, but it felt a lot like a rehash of The Muppet Movie and The Muppets Take Manhattan with the same \\"We need to put on a show but nobody wants us\\" theme. It was sort of bland and sweet like vanilla custard. The best part of the movie was the Mahna Mahna song at the end.<br />My dream for the Muppets would be for Disney to get some really great writers like John Lasseter & Andrew Stanton, the guys who did Toy Story and Finding Nemo, to do the Muppets next movie. Make them great again, and one of those movies people of all ages will love. I think the Muppet show and characters have huge potential, and I hope Disney will find a way to bring that out. Mahna Mahna!

0345522478|5.0|Atticus is a centuries old Druid. Living in Tempe, Arizona, going about his business, quietly of running a small shop that specializes in books of the occult variety and medicinal teas. To everyone, Atticus looks like a normal, handsome twenty something guy, but in reality he is a skilled Druid who has survived for centuries, a large part due to his magical necklace that took him nine hundred years to craft. What starts as a seemingly ordinary, hotter than Hades day in Arizona quickly turns dangerous. Outside his store, a group of paranormal thugs attack Atticus. The steely warrior soon disposes of them, but not before he learns they were sent by his biggest enemy, Aenghus `Og. The attackers are after the magical sword, Fragarach. A sword forged in the Tir na nOg, the Fae Realm. As soon as he finishes cleaning the mess up, a large black crow, harbinger of death, or better known as The Morrigan arrives in his store. She and Atticus struck a bargain centuries ago that allows for his longevity. Even the Morrigan is concerned for Atticus' well being. Trouble hangs thick on the wind. Can Atticus once again escape the deadly fury of Aenghus Og or are his days, as everyone seems to think, truly numbered?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*I was completely blown away by this book. Atticus is an awesome hero. A Druid skilled in magic, herbs, shapeshifter, healing power and he draws his energy from the earth. Not only is he a kick butt character, but he is witty and a bit sarcastic as well. The other great thing about him, is that he has a large Irish Wolfhound, Oberon, with whom he communicates telepathically. Let me just say, Oberon steals the show with all of his hilarious dialogue on sausages, arse sniffing, French poodle harems and Ghanghis Kahn. Oberon is on my list of all time favorite side kicks.<br />*I loved how this book immediately opens with action and it doesn't let up. Each chapter piles on more trouble for Atticus until he is neck deep in hot water. There are so many developments and twists in the plot that you don't get bored. I also loved the fact that you were constantly trying to figure out who were the good guys and who were the baddies.<br />*I loved meeting Atticus' neighbor the old widow, Mrs. MacDonagh. This old gal is full of sass and spunk. She is lucky enough to have Atticus do her yard work and while he works in the yard, she sits on the porch and makes inappropriate comments. The best part about her is that she tosses back some neat whiskey before church. She is so fun, I hope she is in the rest of the series.<br />*I enjoyed having a male protagonist that is a Druid. I know very little about Druids and Celtic lore and Mr. Hearne helped my dive into his world and gain a new appreciation.<br />*Starting this book, I was expecting a read set in a fantasy world, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book was set in my former home of Metro Phoenix. So I was familiar with the setting and many of the places in the story. I liked that Mr. Hearne set his urban fantasy book in our modern world, but there are plenty of paranormal entities who live among us and go unnoticed. This book has werewolves, vampires, Celtic Gods, Fae, and witches to name a few. Expect the unexpected in this book.<br />*This book avoids my arch nemeses: the horrendous cliffhanger and the love triangle. Thankfully, both of these elements are out of this book. So if you are looking for a read that does not involve that love angle theme, read Hounded.<br />*The best part about reading this book, is that I read it in a month long read along event with many other bloggers. It is fun to read a book with fellow bloggers and compare notes along the way.<br />And The Not So Much:<br />*Honestly, there are only a couple of minor considerations. First, this book is jam packed with Irish lore and language. It is a lot to take in and keep track of, but Mr. Hearne does an excellent job of helping you stay afloat. He even provides a nice list and pronunciation guide at the beginning, to help you make sense of everything.<br />*There is a section in the book where Atticus discusses all that goes into becoming a Druid. I enjoyed learning all of this, but I wish that there was a bit more, again just because I am unfamiliar with Druids and Celtic Lore.<br />*This book builds and builds toward a deadly showdown with the antagonist, Anghus `Og, but when you finally get to those last chapters, it kind of felt a bit anti-climatic. I won't go into much detail to avoid spoilers, but the big epic battle felt a bit hurried. Not to say that it wasn't entertaining, it was, I was just a little surprised at how quickly Atticus ran into difficulty.<br />*Finally, maybe this is just me, but when I saw the cover I thought this book doesn't look like it is for me. I don't tend to read too many fantasy books. This is a case of don't judge a book by its cover, thinking this is a book for men. Ladies, do not hesitate to read this. This book is awesome and it will appeal to a wide variety of readers. There is a little something in it for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to continue the series.<br /><br />Hounded, is a fantastic book. Follow the resourceful Atticus as he fights to stave off his mortal enemy. Be on your toes because this book is action packed and full of awesomeness. The lovable Oberon will sink his teeth into your heart with all of his hilarious commentary. If you are thinking of reading this book but haven't gotten around to it, get after it NOW! If you have never heard of this book and want something fun, get this NOW! Books two and three are currently available and book four, Tricked, will be released April 24, 2012. No long waits in between books with this series.iation guide at the beginning, to help you make sense of everything.<br />*There is a section in the book where Atticus discusses all that goes into becoming a Druid.

B00782O7IY|5.0|It is a masterful movie-maker who can take a simple story (much less a silent one) and captivate an audience. That \\"The Artist\\" is so straight-forward is itself a tribute to the old adage that any story can capture the imagination, it just must be true to the soul. The genius here is that you are totally drawn into this world in near totality by the expressions on the actors' faces. It belies the fact that the silent film is indeed a lost art and we are fortunate to have it re-introduced to the main-stream in such a glorious fashion.<br /><br />But first things first, this is *not* a stodgy, stick-in-the mud film. \\"The Artist\\" is at times laugh-out-loud, and then is equally engrossing as an emotional hay-maker. If you are expecting a dull yawn-fest, go see the latest CGI-laden summer film. But if in the the best sense you want to be captivated by a film, see \\"The Artist\\".<br /><br />Without any giveaways, the story here involves an aging film star who is being left behind by the rise of the sound-age of film. Right behind him is a rising starlet who is excelling in the sound age. It is their story to tell: his from the perspective of the slide down and hers from the climb up. There is great supporting work as well, including a delightful little doggy who is essentially the side-kick to our hero. But it is lead actor Jean Dujardin who rightly \\"steals\\" the picture with his breath-taking emotional range.<br /><br />Also a delight are the little scenes we as an audience identify with as true-isms: the bits of film magic that stick with you long after you leave the theater. The rising starlet using our hero's jacket in a pantomime, reflecting her awe and love of him, is the perfect example. But what tops it all in my mind are those moments where \\"The Artist\\" blends old-fashioned movie staples into itself and makes you want to cheer, though you know it's been done a thousand times before. An example being the aforementioned doggy as hero at one point. It is this homage toold films that makes you smile - the director is so skillful at it, he creates his own legitimate, unique and praise-worthy old-Hollywood world without it feeling stale in the least. In fact, it is as refreshing to watch as anything else you will see this year or any other.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is the best of what movies should be: good storytelling that makes it look easy.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I purchased the headphone for my 18 year old son and his PC gaming.  The sound on these headphones are fantastic and the mic. is great, however the overall construction of the headphones are less than the best.  He has had the head phones since Christmas and they have broken three times.  I managed to glue them together twice, but the plastic pieces on the over-the-head-section keep breaking into smaller and smaller pieces.  I am currently in the process of trying to get Turtle Beach to honor their one year guarantee on their products and have not hear back from them.  I was sure to register the product so if there were any problems we could get help. I am concerned that since we purchased them through Amazon they may give me some trouble. I wish these would have been better quality as my son really liked them and for the money we figured we had a good deal.  They are very comfortable and work great, but just can't handle being used almost every day like he uses them.  He cares for his things very well, but these just didn't last.
B004UID2LC|5.0|download full vids. off youtube and can be seen full screen must get this app for kindle fire or any device
B0058VW36U|4.0|love the game but its a shame that instead of giving another level, this latest update did nothing but add advertisements for the new cut the rope experiments..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of choices and itd challenging. this game makes you want to continue playing and advance farther into more games!!! i highly reccomend.
1451673442|5.0|Awesome book, another great one from Rhonda Byrne. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! I am so grateful to her for the work she has done. My life has only gotten better since I have been reading her material.
0061765236|5.0|My co-worker recommended this book to me and I picked up the audiobook version so that I could listen to it while doing other things.  The fact is that it started out slow but at the same time, it was amazing.  Every time I thought I figured something out there was a twist in the plot, the characters were great, and I found myself aching to know what the resolution to the whole thing was.  The fact is that this book left an impression on me and that is really hard to do for me sometimes, some books are interesting but they aren't thought provoking.  And this book got into my head.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I first heard Birdy's song \\"Skinny Love\\" on an episode of The Vampire Diaries.  I remember (since I have DVR) rewinding that part over and over again, so I could write down the lyrics.  I immediately went online and searched the lyrics.  It came back as Bon Iver.  I knew that wasn't right, so I went on youtube and found Birdy.  My life has had a much more positive outlook since.<br /><br />Birdy, at just 15 years old, has a hauntingly ancient knowledge in her voice.  Her versions of very famous songs by very famous artists, with her vocal range and depth makes the listener completely immersed into the music.  It is impossible for anyone (personal opinion) to not feel something inside of themselves about a time in their own lives when listening to her voice.<br /><br />Absolute MUST buy for anyone out there.
0307959856|1.0|I was so excited to see this book on the shelves and after two weeks it  is so unforgettable that I cannot remember the ending!  I am a big fan of the Austen continuation novels but this one was an epic fail! Save your money!
B0062W5U32|1.0|Excellent book as always, but the utility is greatly diminished by the fact that all of the tables are unusable. Even on PC they are too small and blurred to be read or used. It is so bad, I can almost believe it was done on purpose or through criminal negligence. If you actually need data - don't buy this book.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Amazon was glad to finally ship this mobile game system to me for I kept ordering and cancelling the order.I was on the fence for two weeks and fell off on the wrong side. I'm an otr driver and wanted an additional option to play or watch movies if wanted when I was outside the truck stuck for repairs etc.  The product is very well built, hook ups great, sound better than expected, and head phones options great too. Only 1 complaint- the picture dark - esp in the gaming. Not much options avail in brightning up the picture. Even used the xbox and ps3 console settings to help out.  The brighter the room the better, and some games like sports and daytime setting games acceptable- but night time - dark games is like playing doom with the flashlight off.  Overall it deserves the 4 stars instead of 3 and this is the best portable system available. however, with all the technology these days - they can do better. I'm sure i'll keep it - since I wont be using it that much - plus I'll drive amazon crazy - for I would just reorder it again.. --<br /><br />  Update -- the product has an official web site that has preset f/q  that must be seen to set up properly. Changes required for the ps3 blu ray viewing.  lost manual before reading- so unknown if the exact settings addressed.  also web site has some great theme skins. this product keeps getting better and better. Fill in the rating starsssss<br /><br />have had the system for a month now and put away my monitor to spend time with this new unit. at times view is great at a desk sitting level- and others - rolled up magazine was needed too. however-i'm  ordering another one to keep from having to swap from  xboxes/ps3. geames customer techs are very helpful and prompt with their assistance. five stars all the way
B005LAIH54|3.0|Then you'll probably like this one.<br />I'll keep it short and free of spoilers.<br />I really liked the first one.<br />I thought it paid acceptable homage to the original while updating things.<br />That said the original suffered from its share of issues.<br />Namely horrible dialog, some pretty bad acting from everyone but Fiennes and Neeson.<br />A plot that jumped around too much.<br />It was a huge CGI fest but it was still a fun movie.<br />This movie is pretty much the same thing only with better acting.<br />It still has a story without any real emotion behind it.<br />The FX are outstanding.<br />Neeson and Fiennes of course steal the show as always.<br />I have to give the edge to Hades (Fiennes), his hair rules.<br />Kidding.<br />The story really needed more than an hour and a half to properly develope.<br />I hope the DVD has an extended version.<br />Is it worth seeing in the theaters?<br />Of course.<br />The theater is the BEST place to see a movie like this.<br />It's fun.<br />It's mindless.<br />It doesn't try too hard to be anything life altering.<br />It's just a good old fashioned summer popcorn movie.<br />Recommended.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This film could be labeled simply as a collection of beautiful images dressed up with an interesting sound track and that would be a rational definition but....when you really watch this movie, it is mesmerizing art. May not have a dialogue but it most definitely depicts a powerful story. May not have actors but those participating are the real thing and so incredibly beautiful that even a monkey face has the impact of Mona Lisa. The music and sound track complement and enhance the experience to even higher levels. I find very interesting that this is the first film ever that I rate 5 stars. I have watched it 6 times in the first month and the last time was as good experience as the first, weird! Incredibly moving. Outstanding work.<br />Can't stop talking about it and recommending it to all my friends.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|an awesome game. well done rovio. just a little on the pricey side but worth it. you will be amazed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider! ! makes the time fly by!! My mother taught me when I was young and I have always loved most any kind of solitaire.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|I have over 9ooo songs on my ipod and this is the best album. an incredible fresh sound that i keep coming back to time and time again. Energetic!
0312641893|1.0|This was not a great book to read. The book started out interestingly enough, but started loosing me half way through and completely lost me before I could finish.<br /><br />The characters don't behave realistic. I just can't buy how quickly Prince Kai falls for Cinder, and how he responds to her. Cinder seemed interesting in the beginning, but her actions grow impulsive and stupid. She goes against the good advice, and makes such a scene multiple times and gets herself in more trouble...it's utterly frustrating. I can't read a book where you can't respect the characters.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I've enjoyed every moment that I've listened to this cd - been a good while since something that make you feel the way this does has come out.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie.  It has more action and drama than the previous sagas. And then with it being a 2 disk set, the behind the scene documentary was very interesting which made the 2 disk set a plus.  And the price was great.  If I would have found this at Walmart, I would probely be paying over 20 dollars for it.  Thanks Amazon, for keeping prices low!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The 50 Shades trilogy , (Gray, Darker and Freed) was for once a erotic tail full of characters you fall in love with. After the first book you need the second and third to complete your fantasies of Christian and Ana, lets face it he has it all, looks , money and sexy as hell.  The sex will surely  make you tingle  , and  once you can put the books down for the night you can provoke some entertainment of your own! Totally a must read !!
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This is just like that marbles game but for me it's a Lot better due to the Adorable little fuzz-balls!  I also like the Much Better instructions &amp; just the Whole way it's presented is So Much Better &amp; makes for a More Enjoyable game. Don't let the Cute Fuzzys fool you though. Starts out easy but very soon requires your brain to be at work! I Truly Do Enjoy playing this game. Thank You for making it free today!  Love- Love- Love!
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire, the follow up to the ever-popular Hunger-Games, continues Collins' strong direct prose and intelligent storyline.<br /><br />Fans of course will be stoked (Lets face it, fans will have already read this book, and the only reason they'll read this review is to see whether I will confirm their love of the trilogy)<br /><br />Not fans may be a little disappointed. While Catching Fire begins with the promise of expanding the world of Panem, and creating a more world reacting epic tale, Collins opts to re-invent the wheel with yet another Hunger Game.<br /><br />Sure there are new rules, new players, and higher stakes, but somehow Katniss just ends up reprising her role as fiesty, ethical, fire-girl while the larger world problems just end up solving themselves.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  From the long shot in the beginning to the beautiful period clothes and atmosphere...this is a love story to remember.  They did a very good job of making the story more easily accessible to a younger generation who has probably not read the book.  Here's to creating new Jane Austen fans!<br /><br />Oh yeah, can you say Mister Darcy?  MMM.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to occupy your free time. Recommend it to everyone. I have enjoyed it many times as I have been free of other responsibilities and had spare time to play the game.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|Feynman is one of my heroes in science, but I've kept away from this book for some reason. I believe it was worth the wait. His character comes crashing out of the print, full speed ahead.  He wants you to like him and believe he's a mensch, but a highly gifted and slightly eccentric mensch. He succeeded.<br /><br />This is not a literary book.  It is a conversation, with all of the self-absorption along with more than a little self-deprecation that such introspections typically bring.  But, Feynman's work product continues to be a huge force in physics today and he worked with and knew many of those more publicly exposed scientists of the 20th Century. That makes the conversation worth listening to without the speaker picking up the bar tab. His science is wonderful.  His morality...not so much.<br /><br />Reading the book, it is almost impossible not to draw comparisons between what Feynman was able to achieve under the conditions and tools available to him at that time, and the work of some of the leading public science advocates today.  Feynman doesn't lose in the comparison.<br /><br />Lawrence Krauss recently wrote a biography on Feynman.  If you are able to only purchase one of these books, I recommend Feynman's own view of himself as the starting point.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could. Not quite as beautiful as Delirium, but wonderful writing, nonetheless!  Reading this made me remember an article I read about YA fiction these days, how these books are written to be very much in the \\"here and now\\". This book is such a perfect, and elegant, example of just that. Everything Lena goes through, the reader goes through, and Oliver does a very good job with that. Perfect escapism, but it isn't really escapist, considering the kinds of books, teen dystopian novels are coming up very much in the tradition of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale: this is a warning of what we, as a global society could be headed for, and we need to take heed...<br /><br />Sorry to get so serious there--this was a great book, and I cannot wait for the sequel!
0440244412|5.0|Can I just say... FINALLY!!! I've been waiting to read this book for what feels like AGES. It was definitely worth the wait. Read the rest of this review here: [...]
0756404738|5.0|As far as sequels go, this novel is perhaps not quite as thoroughly engrossing as the first, but still quite good. However, the main point of this review is to rate the quality of the product, as opposed to the more subjective review of the artistic and creative quality of its contents.<br /><br />This is now one of the nicest books that I own, simply because of the quality of the paper used and the sturdiness of the binding.  This may to seem to be a rather odd comment to leave in a book review, but this what struck me more than anything else the moment I opened the package.
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|This movie is the original, it came out in '99, 13 years before Hunger Games. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie.
B007OUFESC|4.0|But if you're interested in Jung and Freud and their contentious relationship then this is an interesting movie.  But if you're not then this movie will put you to sleep. It is slooow moving. The relationship between Jung and Sabina is equal doses of slightly kinky and very complicated. Viggo makes a terrific stuffy, repressed and endlessly cigar smoking Freud. Did I mention this is not a family movie?
B007MDB71O|5.0|great old fashioned family adventure. before star wars before avatar Edgar rice Burroughs gave us John Carter. i have waited years for this to be brought to the big screen and i was not disappointed!
0062124293|5.0|I read this book and laughed a lot while doing so.<br /><br />Then I had to face the acid test. I handed it to my wife - the professional nay-sayer, the woman who thinks that puns are not funny - and told her to open it at random and start reading. I expected to have it back within seconds with a dismissive remark, but instead she started reading it, chuckling occasionally, and when she turned the page she put her fingers under the next page, the quicker to read it. I asked her what the chuckles were for, but she didn't answer and kept on reading. Then she laughed so hard she nearly fell off the chair. She looked at me and said, \\"She's good.\\"<br /><br />I said \\"I've finished it, you can read it,\\" but she insisted that I write my review first. That makes sense, considering that she has a bunch of friends that she passes on books to that she thinks are important (books, that is). So here it is.<br /><br />And the only thing I can say I said in the review title - Buy it. It's the funniest book I've read this year, and probably the last year as well. Billed as a \\"feminist\\" book, by American standards it is not academic enough and way too funny, yet it addresses some of the major issues woman have like what to name your sexual parts, your pubic hair and so on. There's also a great deal of stuff on how women are sucked up into the vortex of buying clothes and high heels, having Brazilian waxes, and plenty more. The book is a vague memoir of life since she was thirteen, living in close-to-poverty, yet she managed to win a national newspaper essay competition and get on the staff of the prestigious Melody Maker Brit-pop rag in just the next three years. She also started her career as a national newspaper columnist (most of which was spent in the London Times) and hosted some TV shows.<br /><br />You might expect this to be the story of some bimbo blonde dolly, or a Kardashian sister. But Caitlin at 35 is in many ways obviously still Caitlin at 13, and she manages to be extremely funny. At thirteen, and able to borrow adult library books, she \\"has struck filth gold,\\" by reading Jilly Cooper's \\"Riders,\\" a semi pornographic novel from the 1980s - naturally you can get it from Amazon US [[ASIN:B001O9CEPU Riders]]. Then she grows pubic hair and shaves it off after her mother draws the whole family's attention to it in the living room.<br /><br />Eventually she moves the hundred and thirty miles to London, marries and has a couple of children, the birth of which she describes in excruciating but hilarious detail. In her capacity as pop music critic she interviews Lady Gaga in a revealing yet drunken way.<br /><br />And gradually she becomes aware of the role of women in society. As she says, \\"The patriarchy must be knackered by now. It's been 100,000 years without even a tea break: men have been ruling the world. They have been balls to the wall.\\" She wants \\"some sort of flextime\\" where women ruled the world half of the time, while the men can \\"really sort out the shed, once and for all.\\" She makes it clear she doesn't hate men, and her variety of feminism is more warm and funny than burning your (underwired and painful) bra.<br /><br />Where is the American Caitlin Moran? The cover hints at Tina Fey, but although I haven't seen much of Tina Fey I doubt she's an equivalent of Caitlin Moran.<br /><br />So you should buy this book. Yes, that means you - Woman, Man, and what Flickr calls \\"Other.\\" Just be sure to take your ass with you when you laugh it off. And you will.le to borrow adult library books, she \\"has struck filth gold,\\" by reading Jilly Cooper's \\"Riders,\\" a semi pornographic novel from the 1980s - naturally you can get it from Amazon US [[ASIN:B001O9CEPU Riders]].

As she says, \\"The patriarchy must be knackered by now. It's been 100,000 years without even a tea break: men have been ruling the world. They have been balls to the wall.\\" She wants \\"some sort of flextime\\" where women ruled the world half of the time, while the men can \\"really sort out the shed, once and for all.\\" She makes it clear she doesn't hate men, and her variety of feminism is more warm and funny than burning your (underwired and painful) bra.    Where is the American Caitlin Moran? The cover hints at Tina Fey, but although I haven't seen much of Tina Fey I doubt she's an equivalent of Caitlin Moran.    So you should buy this book. Yes, that means you - Woman, Man, and what Flickr calls \\"Other.\\" Just be sure to take your ass with you when you laugh it off. And you will.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This new character (Puller) fits the Baldacci genius! This book is GREAT! I compare it to the Camel club series of books with Oliver Stone (I want more camel club books) or the King and Maxwell series, (I can't wait for the next one!). The new book with Puller is due out April 17, 2012, (if I have the right information) and I will be purchasing it to start when I finish  SIMPLE TRUTH. Baldacci is an amazing author, he keeps pumping these books out and each one is as good or better than the last!!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Amazing. Truly amazing. People say it needs more levels, but truly, think about it. There's three worlds, each with many levels. Also, if you continue to update this game, there will be even more!<br /><br />The game is amazing. It's challenging too. There is antigravity mode and more. Personaly, I stink at angry birds, so I haven't done much of the game, so I don't know what else there is. This game is challenging, mostly because to the harder levels with the extra stuff. The game is truly amazing.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Enlightening view of a lesser-known hobby, with great scenery and amazing bird photography.<br />The interplay between 3 main characters is witty and delightful.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Forget what the naysayers reviewed.  It brought me back to my childhood.  I thought it had a good enough plot.  Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago.  Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek.  And what were you expecting Shindler's List?  L.A. Confidential?  The first time you saw Sixth Sense?  It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|It's a great puzzle game. I haven't seen the open feignt part. I really like the undo button. I originally set out to just demo it, but ended up spending 10 minutes playing it because it did challenge me as I really like puzzle games.  I like it.  the cute fuzz balls add a bit of appeal too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|As a veteran, I have to say that this is the most realistic, no BS, pull no punches description of what it was like to be there. Kyle saved a lot of lives, and his story is as compelling as it is harsh. This book, much like war, is not for the faint of heart. If you've never known the heart-pounding fear that is combat, this story is as close as you can get without having to hear bullets whiz by your head. I can't recommend this book highly enough.
0061689246|3.0|This book was my first foray into fantasy outside of my slight Harry Potter obsession and it was pretty awkward. Like dancing with a guy with broccoli in your teeth awkward. At that point I'd heard of Neil Gaiman but along with this book popping my fantasy cherry, it also popped my Gaiman cherry (sorry, sir). At that moment, I wasn't all that impressed, at least not to the extent with which everyone who likes fantasy held him to. I just didn't see it. It was interesting, sure, but it read as if it were trying too hard to be something other than what it was. I took issue with that, especially since it was pretty different in tone from the movie. Now before you grab the pitchforks, I saw the movie before I even knew it was based on a book. Like I said, I was new to the genre. And I love the movie. Only natural to read the book to compare. Eh.<br />Overall, it was an interesting read. I don't know if it's something I could read over and over and over again but it was good nonetheless although I felt the book was a bit rushed in too many pivotal places and some greater depth was rendered.<br /><br />The relationship between Yvaine and Tristian, for example, I would have liked to see something a bit more gradual blossom between them because it read like turning on a light switch. Throughout nearly the entire thing Tristian talked only of Victoria but, at the 11th hour and 59th minute, he says no, I love Yvaine and she him. It just seems that it wasn't there and then, miraculously, it was. At least with the movie we're able to see the animosity between the two slowly drift away and their like for each other grow. In the book, Tristian was enthralled with Victoria for 95% of the time and we see a gradual decline from Yvaine's bitterness to something more closely resembling begrudging submission with the jump to love something akin to jumping over the Grand Canyon. There seemed to be no segue.<br /><br />Another major point that very much irked me were the voices in the story. They all seemed to blend except for Yvaine when she was cranky. I felt the language, the tone of voice, was shared by all characters most of the time. I found it difficult to differentiate between any of them and even discern emotions. They just read very flat to me, as if Gaiman were trying to portray a particular attitude of the time but instead of inflection we're given a British Ben Stein wearing the clothes of the pauper, the witch, the Wall-folk and the noblemen simultaneously. Initially I thought it was some kind of British wit that I just wasn't getting.<br /><br />Outside of those, I would have liked to see a bit more worldbuilding. At times it felt like I was traveling by candlelight through the book itself and that I wasn't privy to such wonders that the world had to offer. Too much time was spent leading up to, and getting Tristan over, the wall and not enough within Stormhold itself. He spent months over there and yet, for most of it, we're just given glimpses of what he's done, what he's seen, what Stormhold could possibly offer. I didn't care so much about what was going on in Wall as I did with what was going on in Faerie.<br /><br />If elements from the movie could be combined with elements from the book, I think the book itself would be more well-rounded, I would have a better grasp on the world itself and a greater element of magic and fantasy would emerge. If given the choice, I would rather watch the movie than read the book again simply because I felt the movie offered more. I'm probably stomping on something that's the epitome of fantasy in many people's eyes but its just how I feel. It didn't leave me wanting more story to carry on from the end; it left me wanting to know more about what I was teased with in between the covers.<br /><br />Lucky for me, my internet friends love me and are thoroughly forgiving of my indiscretions. It was the lovely Stormy that enlightened me to the fact that Stardust isn't written in Gaimen's usual style and was something more of an experiment in the old timey ways of story telling. Well that certainly explains it! It doesn't explain away what I found lacking in the book but it explains the voice and tone, without a doubt.<br /><br />Actually, I'm happy I started my Gaimen adventure with this book. I think I would have been more disappointed had I read his other work (which I've started doing, yeah, now I can understand the canonization) first because I don't think this one holds muster to the rest. I got this one out of the way and now I can peaceably move on to the better works.d was something more of an experiment in the old timey ways of story telling. Well that certainly explains it!

1416955070|3.0|That and, uh, the bod on the cover didn't hurt either.<br /><br />Ok, first things first-the descriptions that wouldn't die. By the end of the book I was so fed up with the similes of doom that I wanted to inflict bodily harm onto small woodland creatures. Thankfully for them it's winter and they're all hibernating. But seriously, reading this I couldn't help but keep thinking of The Bookshelf Muse and their setting thesaurus they have with their mentions of similes and metaphors. You know, how they portray more powerful images when used sparingly. I guess Miss Clare missed that memo. Or is severely dyslexic. Seriously, this book is the epitome of what NOT to do with similes.<br /><br />Here is an example for you all. Just let me say, I did not seek out the worst offending section of the book. I didn't have to. It was just there and it summarizes so nicely what all 485 pages were like.<br /><br />In the half-light of the big empty rooms they passed through on their way to the roof looked as deserted as stage sets, the white-draped furniture looming up out of the dimness like icebergs through fog.<br /><br />When Jace opened the greenhouse door, the scent hit Clary, soft as the padded blow of a cat's paw: the rich dark smell of earth and the stronger, soapy scent of night-blooming flowers-moonflowers, white angel's trumpet, four-o'clocks-and some she didn't recognize, like a plant bearing a star-shaped yellow blossom whose petals were medallioned with golden pollen. Through the glass walls of the enclosure she could see the lights of Manhattan burning like cold jewels.<br /><br />That's page 308, chapter 17, the very first two paragraphs. Aside from the fact that the first sentence is as clunky as fish filled platform shoes (har har), within those THREE sentences lie FIVE similes. This . . . is how the entire book read. Not like I had to wonder what took me so long to finish it. I just don't understand why she couldn't let the descriptions lie. Most of them were perfectly fine until a simile was tacked onto the end of it.<br /><br />This one's my favorite though. It actually elicited a physical and audible response out of me (namely eye-rolling and groaning, and at work)-<br /><br />\\"Clarissa,\\" her father said, in a voice as oily as steel slicked with butter.<br /><br />O_o Ok, see, the point with similes is, aside from using them sparingly, they should, usually, make sense. For the love of god someone please tell me how steel and butter go together? Am I the only one imagining a big pat of butter melting on a steel girder? Or some dude with a big ass sword trying to butter toast? Is this . . . necessary? Really? This is just the kicker. There are more. Many more. Not quite as good. But more.<br /><br />Like a \\"voice like raw silk.\\" What does raw silk sound like?<br /><br />Then there were the odd uses of other senses. Like an apple. Apparently it tasted green. Um, can someone please tell me what green tastes like? And just so you don't think I'm taking it out of context, this is the sentence, and the one that preceded it-<br /><br />She took a bite. The apple tasted green and cool.<br /><br />The only green taste I know is the green death of NyQuil. Now I know it's been quite a few years since I've had a fresh apple (allergies) but I highly doubt they taste like that. So, uh, green? Taste?<br /><br />Another good use of one (that I didn't mark so don't have the exact quote) of the senses, smell, is having something smell like iron and melting snow. Iron, yes. I definitely get. Smelled that metallic smell many times. But melting snow? That's a new one for me. And I live in Connecticut. In fact, I have melting snow just outside my door. No smell. Now on the flip side, you can smell snow coming. I don't know if this is a strictly New England thing (as I've only heard New Englanders talk about this) but I don't see how others in equally cold places wouldn't now about this. Just before it snows and the skies are all cloudy, it smells like snow; a very crisp, almost comforting scent. That I know. This melting snow bit? Not a clue. I could step outside and suck right now and I still couldn't tell you.<br /><br />Does vertigo hit your stomach? Vertigo is a sight thing (people afraid of heights, for instance, I get it every time I look down from my office window on the 15th floor) and an inner ear thing (or middle ear thing), caused by an off-balanced equilibrium. All of which causes nausea. But vertigo doesn't hit your stomach directly. Nausea is a by-product. Eh, call this a nit pick of a statement that caught my eye.<br /><br />Along with nauseous horror. That was used a couple times on the same page. It's kind of an odd feeling to begin with but to use it multiple times within a few paragraphs just becomes jarring.<br /><br />And then there were the adverbs. Those -ly spawns of Hell. Don't get me started on those.<br /><br />But, aside from that, it really wasn't bad. If I could give one piece of advice to the author, for the love of god take a hack saw to the similes and listen to your gut. Usually it'll tell you to stop at a certain point in describing something. Anything beyond that is usually too much. Stop ignoring it. The book could have been half the length cutting out all those superfluous descriptions.<br /><br />Despite that bog, there was near-constant action, suspense and a bit of a soap opera finish. Clary peeved me every once in a while. For a girl that really is sharp and smart, holy crap could she be dumb and oblivious. And I'm not talking about to the otherworldly stuff going on around her. Her situation with Simon comes to mind. But from beginning to end it's action, action, action which is something that I love to see in a book but the descriptions really slowed it down.<br /><br />I have this pull to want to read the next book in the series but I fear the similes too much. The thing is, had I read this maybe five years ago, I probably would have swallowed it whole and enjoyed it for what it was. Not that I can't do that now but the more things I find wrong with a book, the more it pulls me out. At least my education is working and my indentured servitude to Sallie Mae isn't in vain.<br /><br />Really, I would recommend this book. There's really nothing wrong with it plot-wise or character-wise, for the most part. I found myself uninterested at times but I really think that had a lot to do with the enormous amount of descriptions. They diluted everything. It should not have taken me this long to read this book. But there you go.<br /><br />I also think another reason why it stayed with me despite the descriptions is that it's a New York-based story. New York City's my second home. I love it. I used to live there so I can feel, hear and taste everything the characters do when the city's brought into the plot. I had no idea Renwick Ruin even existed on Rosie (Roosevelt Island) and I've been there quite a few times. And it's not like the place is big. I must seek it out (really, you can walk end to end in five minutes) because I love derelict buildings. Obviously I wasn't paying attention enough (or I was fooled my the glamor!). New York holds a place in my heart so this book gets points for that.<br /><br />If you love action and fantasy and can overlook similes in nearly every sentence (and can bypass the \\"Luuuuuuuuuuke, I aammm your faaaaaatherrrrrrr\\" moments), then go out and buy this book and read it (or check it out of your local library). Really, you won't be disappointed, probably because you will be lost in the story, and in a good way.

0385751532|4.0|Having On Demand is a dangerous thing. A couple of button clicks and I can have a new release playing on my TV. I kept seeing the trailers for the movie version of this book and eventually my curiosity got the better of me. I watched it and felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest and lit on fire by a flame thrower. Now, I'm a crier at movies but usually it's a few tears that can easily be wiped away. Here it was full-on body-wracking sobs. The ending was just . . . horrible.<br /><br />I was in the middle of reading another book when I watched that and once I finished that, I picked up this one so I could compare. It's a very fast read and it's a story kept in its simplest terms because of the fact it's told from the POV of a nine-year-old boy. It couldn't get more in depth because it wouldn't have stayed true to the voice. But I just don't think this book had as much impact at its movie counterpart.<br /><br />I think the deviation from Bruno's POV in the movie, the brief glimpses into his mother's and father's world, made the impact of the ended that much more bitter a pill to swallow. The emotion was that much more intense and the passivity of Bruno was watered down with the lives of those people around him.<br /><br />It's not like the book wasn't good. It's wholeheartedly unique in the fact that it's telling a much-told story from a very different, and naive, perspective. In the interview at the end of the book, Boyne comments on people asking how Bruno wouldn't know what was going on and where he was. Boyne's response was that adults didn't have that kind of enlightenment and didn't know what was going on until the liberations. How would a sheltered nine-year-old boy know then? Very good point.<br /><br />But the ending . . . while the movie remained true to the book, I just felt the book lacked the same kind of impact. Had I not seen the movie and read the book first, I don't know if I would have grasped what just happened at the end because the insinuation of what was going on was so passive. Which was the point of the book but, in my eyes anyway, that tempered it a bit.<br /><br />Yes, it's very sobering to read what happened to Bruno but being able to see the actions and reactions of those around him like the movie showed allowed for a little more depth and a little more understanding of what was going on around him. Again, not having that information was the point of the book. You are looking at this insane world through the eyes of a nine-year-old. You're not supposed to know all that was going on. And I don't think you truly know what's going on even though the end. The movie spells that out for you. I guess that's just something I need for greater impact.<br /><br />I want to see the reactions of his parents and more of his sister and just what kind of solder Lt. Kotler was because it rounds out the picture more. I don't know how mature and aware your average nine-year-old is but Bruno must have lived a very sheltered and spoiled life for the way he acted and how he didn't notice what was going on around him (the smell at the camp alone, which in the movie he reacted to, in the book it was never mentioned, or the way he kept noticing how skinny Schmuel was and how hungry the boy kept saying he was and when Bruno tried to bring him food, he would get \\"peckish\\" and eat it all on the way, that really bothered me, at 9 I would think the kid would know better). The movie gave him a little more credit in the maturity department. There was a little more there to work with. Bruno was more receptive.<br /><br />The intent of the book hit its mark. It told a unique story from a unique perspective. I just happened to like the movie better. Walking away, I felt more from the film than I did the book.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|this game is fun and somewhat hard but there are not enough levels for how much you have to pay to play
B003K1EYM6|3.0|Summary - the camera connection kit works as advertised - and then some. Too bad you have to pay extra when this should be included standard on such a premium product.<br /><br />I'm typing this from a MICROSOFT keyboard hooked up to the iPad 3. Just a good ol' Microsoft USB comfort keyboard hooked up to the iPad 3 with the camera connection kit. I can almost hear Steve turning over in his grave. The keyboard Play/Pause works, the Volume Up/Down works, the mute button works. The Home button and Search buttons even work. The Back/Fwd buttons don't, the email button doesn't and the calculator doesn't. I was happily pleased that what does work does, even if I had to pay 30 bones for the privilege. Too bad that the iPad just doesn't have a built in USB port. Or a full-size HDMI port. What a game-changer that would be. Ah well, back to the Apple world of limited native access.<br /><br />So, they keyboard works fine. The iPhone 4S works fine as well. You can use the USB dongle and the 30-pin USB cable and the iPad will read the iPhone like a camera. The camera roll pops up on the iPad, to which you can edit that library by selecting images and movies to delete or import. You can't preview larger than about a 1\\" thumbnail though, so retina or not you're guessing as far as fine details go.<br /><br />The iPad/DSLR hookup is very much the same. You can view / download / delete images and movies but not really view previews any larger than 1\\" in size. Too bad for wedding photogs like myself, the iPad would be killer to do a quick culling of the hundreds of images before I import them to the workstation for editing. As it stands you get a better view of the detail in an image by checking out the back of your camera LCD. Boo. The good news is that the iPad does recognize camera RAW files (Nikon at least).<br /><br />So basically you can do a very basic sorting of the images you want to import from your camera, then select an app to do some basic edits with if you want. Works great for backup purposes or to hook up some limited USB connectivity. I've read you can trick the iPad to import movies from an SD card as well, but there are some hoops to jump through.<br /><br />Overall, the camera connection kit isn't bad. It should be magical though. :)

B007IQX1G4|2.0|I really enjoy Charlize Theron but this movie was one of her worst, it felt like a movie that really had no point. As one reviewer wrote, I kept waiting for the movie to pick-up, to get better, but it just left you hanging with this empty feeling of 'is that all there is'? The movie never takes the approach that she is going to get better mentally, emotionally, or that she even understands her own short comings. I had anticipated (or hoped for)some humor, but there turned out to be none. Don't waste you money buying or renting this one! If you have any interest in it wait until it is free somewhere then you too can wonder why Charlize Theron would do such an empty movie.

It has set the bar high for this generation, and will/has become a modern staple.  It has been years since I have read anything as touching or haunting.<br /><br />I'll not say a word about the plot, as it is a mystery that is best unraveled by the reader.

0756405890|5.0|Kvothe is the darkness inside us all and the curious innocence that keeps us alive. His journey is a reminder that life takes it toll and rewards us in mysterious ways. The boyish innocence of finding love while being naturally curious is heartfelt as everybody has gone through this, even us females (but in a feminine way). Reading a character arc profoundly written is rare among the mass market paper fiction these days. Kvothe's highs brighten the mood and gives hope that the world is not always dark, while the lows bring back reality and transform skewed perceptions.<br /><br />This book is written as Kvothe's life story told from the old innkeeper, Kote, who Kvothe masks behind. Through luck and misfortune, Kvothe goes from a beloved troupe boy to an orphaned miscreant to an unbecoming member of the Arcane. With help from his natural talents - including his knack for trouble - Kvothe delves into the secrets of life, women, and the Chandrain.<br /><br />Few novels are well-written. These entities stand as measuring lines to what Fantasy should be and not frivolous tales of vampires and werewolves. The artistic and magical elements are not flamboyant, making Kvothe's tale believable. Being an author myself, I appreciate having a prime example of Fantasy that is deeply written without all the little descriptions (you can describe a tree in so many ways). Unlike many authors, Rothfuss sculpts Kvothe and deeply tunes into his emotions, surroundings, and curiosities. Only a handful of authors accomplish such a task, and kudos to Rothfuss for stepping beyond English's hardened form of expectations and into actual human dialect.<br /><br />Yes, this book is long, but so are other great Epic Fantasy novels that withstand the test of time.

B004259BMM|5.0|I've been a fan of Keith Urban since I was 7 years old and to this day, he is still a great inspiration on my own music making. This latest release solidifies his position as one of the greatest country music singers in the past fifteen years. This is a track by track review discussing each song and its qualities, enjoy :)<br /><br />1. Put You in a Song: 8/10 - This is a good upbeat song and has a very catchy chorus. It's not my favorite on the record but it holds some interesting rock inspired guitar licks and not all that original lyrics but Keith pulls it together and makes it a well established single.<br /><br />2. You Gonna Fly: 9/10 - This is a very fun, upbeat song with a little more originality than the preceding song. The chorus is one of the catchiest on the album. It's also nice to here some banjo and slide guitars to get a great country feel. Keith also does a great job on the guitar solo and it really pulls together the song.<br /><br />3. All For You: 10/10 - This is one of my favorites on the album, it's uplifting, beautiful, serene, everything a ballad should be. The lyrics are beautifully rhythmic and the delivery is even better because Keith really pours out his heart in this song. It's a song you have to listen to over and over again.<br /><br />4. Long Hot Summer: 9/10 - Great song, very catchy and upbeat. It's not really an original idea but Keith pulls it off and delivers something different than all those other summer songs. Like many reviewers before me, this is probably the catchiest country song ever.<br /><br />5. Without You: 10/10 - Another great acoustic ballad. Personally, I love the guitar riffs that extend over the song. I also love the lyrics in the chorus and it's obvious that this song was inspired by Nicole. It's beautifully, well executed and a great song to listen to over and over again.<br /><br />6. Georgia Woods: 7/10 - This is my least favorite song on the album but that doesn't mean anything because it's a still a good song. I just don't like the electronic drums in the beginning of the song. I think the song fixes itself when the guitar comes in but I just find the electronic drums bothersome. The chorus is catchy and when the first one comes in, the song becomes a great one.<br /><br />7. Right On Back to You: 10/10 - This is maybe the most underrated song on the album meaning I don't see much praise from other reviewers. This song is beautiful and is one of my favorite Keith Urban songs ever. The lyrics are sad and remind me of the You'll Think of Me days which is why I probably love it so much. One of the highlights of the album.<br /><br />8. Shut Out The Lights: 9/10 - This is a great upbeat song with an exciting chorus and fun guitar riffs. The lyrics are really hard to sing but Keith executes them well and this is overall a great song to end this short album with.<br /><br />- This next song is nowhere on any of Keith Urban's albums. It's a song off the Act of Valor soundtrack and it's called For You. I am just recommending this song, it's on youtube, it has a music video but for some reason it isn't a single. It's a great song. If it were on this CD, it would be favorite. Check it out.<br /><br />I just wanted to say that it's not about quantity, it's about quality and Keith Urban delivers some high quality music with this release. It's highly recommended by your's truly.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|How can anyone hate this book? This is defnitely my favorite book of the Twilight series! I've read a lot of books and i love this one!
0525478817|5.0|Though I read about 4 or 5 books a week, this is my first time writing a review.<br /><br />I was taken completely by surprise. Intelligent, thoughtful, true...<br /><br />That is all I can say at the moment as I am too tired to think because I stayed up all night reading the book, then contemplating the book.
B00004D301|1.0|I loved the low cost of purchasing the DVD unfortunately we are unable to watch it.  The CD is formatted for the UK which is different than the US.  And to be quite honest, not worth the hassle of returning because then the cost of shipping (to and from me) would be more than what I paid for.  So, I'm stuck with a product that doesn't work and that I will end up throwing away.<br /><br />Once bitten, won't let that happen again.  Check before you buy.....is the product for the US or another country?
B005HSG3TC|5.0|If you're looking for a low profile case for the kindle fire, look no further. This case reminds me a lot of the HP brand case for the HP TouchPad, the front material is very similar. The case itself doesn't add very much to the dimensions or weight of the Fire. It also holds the Fire snugly without any straps over the corners which is a huge plus in my opinion. The rubber like material that the back piece is made out of prevents the Fire from sliding around on surfaces while the front flap is thin and has a felt backing to protect the screen.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this case is what others have mentioned, there is a groove on the back of the case where the cover can rest to allow the case to stand up. Unfortunately the groove isn't deep enough to securely hold the cover, so it could slip out causing the Fire to fall back.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this case for the Kindle Fire.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|All I have to say is the simple points that make this thing perfect with my Baby Jogger Summit XC:<br /><br />-Completely washable- wear resistant.

Darker black and mine did not have blue embroidery for the brand label. It was Red.<br />-Low price

B003AQBYUG|5.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I am reviewing the UK version of this set.<br /><br />The video quality is great in all four of the Alien movies in this set.  It is not perfect, but it is close to it.  In one of the movies (I don't remember which), there was some grain and distortion in the black portion of a dark scene.  Mostly, there is no grain or distortion.  I think the second movie had some fine grain sometimes.  Overall, I give the video quality a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is about 2.35:1, except the second movie (Aliens) is 1.85:1.<br /><br />Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is great.  I don't remember great surround sound and sub-woofer bass in the first movie (there might have been), but I did notice it in the last three movies (I remember saying \\"WOW!\\" in the last three).<br /><br />This is the first time I have seen these movies.  I am very glad I bought this Blu-Ray set, because the movies are really good, and the audio/video quality is great.  I was disappointed in the ending of the last movie, because I thought it left things hanging.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I will not comment on the series itself, since so many others have except to say- 1)  my wife and I loved it and and we are NOT fantasy fans at all; 2) the filming and especially the casting is terrific; 3)  Fascinating story in the mode of the British \\"War of the Roses\\" (which is perfect for my British wife).<br /><br />I wanted to say a few words about the Blu-ray extras.  There are many and they are incredibly extensive.  I still haven't watched/read them all-  easily 5 hours of extras, and maybe closer to 10 (I haven't tracked it.)<br /><br />First of all, short interview clips with all the stars helps newcomers/reminders of the characters. Second, extensive video clips with actor voiceovers tell the huge backstory/history of much of the places and the houses/families.  Again, this really helps fill in the information.  Also, there is a during the episode ability, while watching,. to get info and highlights on characters/places within that episode.  And, of course, many commentary tracks on most individual episodes, and documentaries on various aspects of the production.<br /><br />Look,l this is a VERY complicated story and back-story, and these extras really help fill that in.  All are very well done.<br /><br />All in all- a terrific package, the best I have seen for any series.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Some people are complaining that the last 2 books did not move fast enough and the \\"undead\\" good guys are a sham.  I remind them that there have been undead bad guys since the beginning, so why not some undead good guys?  I too am ready for some closure on some elements, but still immensely enjoyed the scope and sweep of Martin's books. I do NOT believe Jon Snow is dead, let's see if he is still around in book 6, which hopefully will not take as long as book five to write.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is entertaining but the ads can be annoying. The mini games are quick and there is a good variety. My only complaint is that you have to click off the ads every 30 seconds.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Ok, so, Catching Fire picks up with Katniss and Peeta back in District 12. They are living in the Victor's Village, and just trying to live their lives as the Star-Crossed lovers still, to the best of their ability, when it's time for the Victor's Tour. They are going to tour all the districts, and show the country how wonderfully in love they are... and they better, because President Snow has come to see Katniss, and threaten everyone she knows and loves if she doesn't.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!<br /><br />Well, Peeta ends up doing a public proposal, and he and Katniss are still majorly playing up the Star-Crossed lovers bit, but President Snow says it's not enough. And then the time comes for the Quarter Quell. And the shocker? The reaping is going to come from the districts' previous victors. Katniss is going to have to go back into the arena.<br /><br />SPOILER OVER!<br /><br />The rest of the book really covers what happens in the games, and I can't give too much away without a horribly massive massive spoiler fest. So, I'll leave it like this: The country is in major unrest, and not happy with this Quarter Quell games. What is going to happen? Will the country Catch Fire? Will the rebellion happen? And what about Peeta and Katniss? Will they get their Happily Ever After? I guess I'm just going to have to read Mockingjay and find out...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the Trilogy for IPad (The first book I have read on IPad.) My husband lost me for a week!  I went to work, but when I was not  working, I was reading.  The author draws you in with an intense plot and character details,  She also expresses a vision of hope and a vital message that change starts with the strengths and weaknesses of one. As a teacher, I look for books that will give my students a passion for reading.  I  am excited to introduce this book to my class.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|If you are a sports fan you will like this movie.  Language is a bit rough for younger kids, but no nudity or violence.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like to play it once in a while. Sometimes I could be stuck on the same level for days, so that could get annoying. Specially when I have to ask my brother for help. It works very well on the Kindle Fire and you can launch the birds smoothly. Might need Wi-fi but it's really no big deal. I usually play it at my house or a friend's house. I mean, who would play it in the desert?

I want to buy another episode, but I am reluctant for obvious reasons.<br /><br />goguddy
B006P0FD4W|1.0|Same story (almost identical to every other paranormal spirits-are-after-you script). Same household; same upstairs/downstairs layout; same kids and their bedrooms and secret places; same security and handheld cameras; same doors and other household items move/open/close on their own; same floating/sliding people; same camera trick of the unexpected whatever jumping in front of the lens; same open ended ending - leaving you wondering, \\"What is next, maybe they are in my closet.\\"<br /><br />What's creative and new? Different actors; different house.<br /><br />What needs to happen? Spirits need to hire imaginative writers that can expand on all those spirit capabilities and studios with bigger budgets (well, any budget will do).
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Having lost me as a fan after Issues, I decided to give the new KoRn a try and I am very glad I did. The entire album creates an intense, dynamic, room filling edge. I would have to say that, at first listen it sounded like a cross between Def Leppard + KoRn or Marilyn Manson + KoRn.<br /><br />Whatever you think, each song is captivating for it's own reasons whether it is a radio hit, explicit lyrics or edgy mood, this album has it. I am very excited to go see them perform some of this live.

It will stay with me forever.
0439023521|5.0|This book immediately sucks the reader into the story. I had been on a reading hiatus because I couldn't get into any books. But The Hunger Games drew me right in. Once I started I could not stop. I read the book in three days (I usually take at least a month to read a book). The story is compelling and exciting. I read it for my book club that consists of psychologists and therapists age 30-40 years old. We marveled at how a book written for young adults could be so enthralling for a bunch of middle aged, well educated, adults. We agreed that part of it was because this book has so many layers of meaning in its social commentary. Additionally I found it refreshing for a 'young adult' story to have such a strong heroine. It's great to see the woman 'save the day', rather than being merely an object of male affection. One tip: if you read this, you're going to want to know the rest of the story, so just go ahead and buy the box set.
0634022296|5.0|I've purchased a lot of sheet music over the last 40+ years, this one is definitely one of the best values in terms of price for what you get.

B0000931QA|5.0|Operation: Mindcrime was the third full-length studio album by the Progressive Metal band Queensrÿche. The multi-platinum album is the band's most famous work, it is considered a must-own and is constantly appearing in magazine and fan countdowns of best-ever-metal-albums. If you haven't heard it already but think it might be up your street, then I advise taking a shot on it, it'll more than likely pay off.<br /><br />The album, which was released in 1988, mixes classic metal influenced by the likes of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest with the scope and scale of Progressive Rock bands like Genesis, Pink Floyd and Rush. The band use the lyrics to create a narrative that runs throughout the album, which assisted by additional sound effects and voice overs from actors.<br /><br />The story tells the tale of a shady Politician named Doctor X who exploits drug addicts into committing crimes that further his political agenda so as to get what he wants without implicating himself, and is told from the perspective of one such helpless youth and deals with his conflicting emotions and the consequences of his actions in a surprising and interesting way.<br /><br />Operation: Mindcrime is an example of the rock opera format done right. The story isn't too basic to be uninteresting but nor is it needlessly convoluted, there are non-musical voice overs and sound effects thrown in to drive the story but they do not take over the album or get in the way of the music and most importantly of all it is a good album anyway; there is no filler, everything flows well together and the album doesn't tail off in quality towards the end.<br /><br />It could be argued that Operation: Mindcrime is one of the best concept albums anyone has released to date for those reasons, it is tight, concise and free of needless excess.<br /><br />Overall, Operation: Mindcrime is an entertaining and expertly crafted album that mixes the attitude of prog with the sound of metal in a brilliant and flab-free way. If you usually like concept albums and rock operas then this is an album that you should consider checking out, if you usually like classic heavy metal then you should seriously consider checking it out and if you usually like Queensrÿche themselves then you really ought to own it already and should get yourself a copy as soon as you can.. If you usually like concept albums and rock operas then this is an album that you should consider checking out, if you usually like classic heavy metal then you should seriously consider checking it out and if you usually like Queensrÿche themselves then you really ought to own it already and should get yourself a copy as soon as you can.

B00782O7NE|5.0|French director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a delight to experience, a highly enjoyable and superbly crafted homage to an era and a style: the silent movies. While one can definitely appreciate it more if one has some familiarity with the silent movie era, it is not a necessity. The Artist will give anyone who's never seen a silent movie the experience of what seeing one was like and how different silent movies were stylistically to the 'talking' films which have been the norm for the last eighty years. And why people loved them as much as they did.<br /><br />The Artist is set in Hollywood - the heart of the film industry - in the critical period between 1927, when silent movies were at their peak, and 1932, by which time they had become a thing of the past, completely displaced by 'talkies'. The film begins with a swashbuckling action sequence, but then the camera moves back and reveals that we're actually watching an audience watching a film, the premiere of a Hollywood studio's latest production featuring its star actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). After the premiere is over, when Valentin is posing for the press outside the theater, an accidental encounter brings him face-to-face with an admiring young fan, Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo), who ends up being photographed with him. In a turn of classic Hollywood mythology, Miller is 'discovered' and given a shot at being an extra in a film, which turns out to be the next film Valentin is featured in. A second chance encounter results in Valentin taking Miller under his wing, insisting to studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) that she be given an actual part in the film. And thus Miller's career in film is begun.<br /><br />The next part of the film draws thematically from film classics Singing in the Rain and A Star is Born. Fast-forwarding ahead to 1929, it is the beginning of the talking era, and studios are rushing to adapt to the new technology. Valentin is dismissive of the innovation, but Zimmer informs him that the studio is switching over to talkies immediately and anyone who can't adapt will be left behind. Refusing to budge, Valentin instead decides to produce his own silent epic, pouring all of his money into the production which he not only stars in but also directs. The film, Tears of Love, bombs horribly, ruining Valentin financially and eventually costing him not only his career and his house but also his marriage as well. But as Valentin's career fades, Miller's star is on the rise and soon she is a leading actress in her own right. But even as the plot descends into melodrama, it retains its comic touches and things are ultimately resolved in the most classically upbeat Hollywood way: a musical dance number.<br /><br />Besides drawing on many of the themes in Singing in the Rain, The Artist is in many ways the perfect counterpoint film to it. Singing in the Rain deals with the transition from silent films to talking films, presented in a talking film with talking actors. The Artist deals with the same transition, but as a silent film centered around the point of view of a silent actor. Hazanavicius makes clever use of his format choices, bringing out Valentin's fears in a delightful sequence where everything in Valentin's room suddenly starts making noises. Already startled, Valentin then descends into panic when he realizes that his own voice is still silent, and that everything - and everyone - is being heard except him.<br /><br />Hazanavicius did a lot of research in preparing for this film and put a lot of thought into the shooting. Besides being down in black and white, the Artist was also filmed in the full-screen ratio (1.33:1) that was the standard during the silent film era, which enhances the actors' faces, making them bigger on the screen, an important factor when much of the characters' intentions and feelings had to be conveyed silently rather than through dialogue. He also studied the lighting and camera techniques the original silent film directors used to enhance expression and convey mood.<br /><br />The cast are, in a word, marvelous. Jean Dujardin's Valentin is the embodiment of the silent film movie idol, using heightened expression and body language - not to mention perfect comic timing - to bring his character to life. This is done quite subtly as we're often watching film within film, so that when the characters - who are silent film actors - portray characters in the films they're making, they're done just slightly more exaggerated than the characters are when they're being themselves. B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo does the same with her Peppy Miller, playing the rising young ingenue and the comedic characters that her character in turn portrays. Hazanavicius knows his actors, having worked with both Dujardin and Bejo in previous films (not to mention being married to Bejo in real life), and knows exactly how to bring out pitch perfect performances from the both of them. The supporting cast, from John Goodman's comically put-upon studio boss to James Cromwell's devotedly loyal chauffeur, Clifton, are also excellent. And then there's Uggie, the perky and soulful little terrier who steals every scene he's in as Valentin's on-screen and off-screen dog.<br /><br />As one would expect in a film like this, Hazanavicius has worked in a number of nods to the silent film age and to films and the film industry in general, some of them fairly obvious and others rather subtle. For example, the sequence that shows Valentin and his wife becoming estranged is a comic take on the classic sequence from Citizen Kane showing Kane and his wife becoming estranged over breakfast. Later, a scene shows Valentin in his reduced-circumstances apartment, watching a reel from one of his silent swashbucklers on a projector. The scene in the film is actually from a real silent film, The Mark of Zorro, which starred Douglas Fairbanks, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era. In the places where the shots are close enough to recognize the actor, Hazanavicius inserted Dujardin in place of Fairbanks. And in another scene later in the film after Miller has become a major star, a rescued Valentin ends up being taken to her mansion after his apartment has a fire. The mansion used in the scene originally belonged to Mary Pickford, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era, and the bed Valentin wakes up in is Mary Pickford's actual bed.<br /><br />Highly recommended, both as a truly creditable homage to the silent silver screen and as a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right.nt film directors used to enhance expression and convey mood.<br /><br />The cast are, in a word, marvelous.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on the Today show...saying it was the dirty little secret of the suburbs.  I live in the burbs so thought id give it a try.  I liked the characters from the beginning.  A couple chapters in I needed someone to share the book with, so I convinced a friend to read it too.  We loved the book(trilogy).  I couldnt put it down...and didnt want it to end. The sex is delicious...but its the need for each other thats so captivating.  Loved it!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved, Loved the books, couldn't put them down I found them very exciting.<br />Would have loved to have more books in the series
1250006341|5.0|Beyond a doubt, this book is a marvelous companion piece to the television series. I'd like to say it covers everything related to the series and defines the period during which it takes place and if anything has been overlooked it wasn't obvious to me.<br />This book is a blend of history and the social mores of the era and deals with events and people that influenced the changing society that the viewer sees in the series.<br />There is emphasis on character development, real life people who inspired the characters who inhabit Downton, and details concerning the the challenges of recreating the clothing and settings that make the series believable as well as seemingly authentic.<br />Of all the small and thought provoking elements covered in this book, I especially enjoyed the information provided about the real life people and events that served as an impetus for the characters that I enjoy so much. It made me realize how thoughtfully the series was developed and how nothing was ignored in order to create such a high level of authenticity.<br />This book is also loaded with picture stills from the series as well as candid shots taken during production. It is a lovely book to look at, but its content is stimulating and enjoyable as well. In total, this book only heightens my appreciation for Downton Abbey.
0786956291|2.0|I had bought this exact starter set from Barnes and Noble for $20, and I must say it's not entirely worth the money.<br /><br />My main gripe was the lack of a useful player's manual. The player's manual supplied is a build a character as you play. The rules are spread out throughout the entire handbook, and character creation isn't set out in a cohesive manner. The quest supplied was decent for a starter set, but it's not something you would care to play again.<br /><br />The dungeon master's handbook is better to look at before the player's manual. It explains basic rules, encounters, monster stats and abilities. The map supplied is decent and double sided. I could see myself using parts of the dungeon in a few of my campaigns at the most.<br /><br />What I evidently ended up using the most, is the dice, and the enemy/player tokens.<br /><br />What I would recommend is buying the player's handbook, the monster manual, dice, and tokens. Those two manuals, with a whiteboard, the dice and tokens make for a better Dungeons and dragons experience that I felt wasn't given by this starter set.<br /><br />Overall, give this starter set a pass. You'll end up spending more money in the long run.

B007N5YIUS|1.0|Really wish this app will work on kindle fire this really sucks I don't understand how to get the game to work. Why do I have to pay for it?
B0063IH60K|5.0|its not that hard to just click skip the ad. don't be so lazy. and they don't pop up during the game only between.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was awsome. It's a fast page turner and I can't wait for the next book. This is one book that has a lot of moments you won't forget. Highly recomended.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|This app was a 4 star app before, but after you added the option to create a custom routine, it has to be 5 stars. I love using it in the morning after waking up.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Without going into a great deal of detail I will just say that this is a truly horrible book.  Poorly written and poorly conceived.  Sadly I fell into the controversy and hype surrounding it and purchased it with very little research done.  If I had read some of the reviews I might have saved my money.  Even if the book had been free I would still feel the same way.<br />Touted as a love story it was anything but.  Laughingly UN-belivable and written in an awkward, childish manner, the story was ugly and sad.  First we are to believe that a 21 year old college student is naive to a ridiculous degree and totally innocent of any sexual experience...she has never even been kissed.  Oh, and she is also beautiful with a slim attractive figure.  That in itself would take a huge leap of faith but we are also supposed to believe that a young, handsome billionaire has fallen for her.<br />She is of course enamored with him and is expecting a typical love affair to ensue.  This is the part that I found sad and troubling.  He is not normal.  He is a sexual predator with anything but honorable intentions.  The message that the author seems to want to send is that if a man is rich enough and good looking enough a woman will accept any type of behavior from him.  I find that idea objectionable and offensive.  I was frankly hoping that the book would end with the young girl extracting some type of revenge for his horrible behavior (as in the Burning Bed).  Sadly that did not happen.<br />This is NOT a love story, it is not a romance, it is not even vaguely erotic.  The so-called love scenes left me nauseated.  The interaction between the two characters was sickening and sad.  The dialog was trite and childish.  The only reason that I kept reading it was because I hoped that surely there would be some redeeming feature. It never happened.<br />The only good part was toward the end when she called him a \\"sick son of a b***h\\" and it did not happen soon enough or often enough.<br />It is hard to imagine two more books on this same topic, one was too many.  Books like this should be offensive to all women and actually to men also.  I would go so far as to say that this book is offensive to those who practice the lifestyle depicted in the book, I am sure it is not an accurate depiction.<br />I can find nothing to recommend in this book, it left a bad taste in my mouth.is hard to imagine two more books on this same topic, one was too many.

0060512806|4.0|First of all, Neal Stephenson is a born novelist; I cannot think of another artistic medium in which he could possibly work in all the numerous and diverse topics which he is knowledgeable about and fascinated by. Stephenson is definitely a big-canvas kind of guy, something that is readily apparent in his massive novel CRYPTONOMICON.<br /><br />I have heard CRYPTONOMICON described as a quick read - this is surely true for some, but alas, it was not to be so for me. When I was younger I was capable of polishing off doorstops like this in a week or two, but this no longer seems to be the case. It took me a full three months to finish this novel, which is frankly more time than I am willing to spend on a single novel anymore, excepting for a [[ASIN:0618640150 The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition]]-level masterpiece (a book, incidentally, that Stephenson obviously admires a great deal, to the point of having one of his central characters use it as analogy for just about everything), which, although a very impressive piece of work, CRYPTONOMICON is not.<br /><br />In conclusion: recommended, but only if you're willing to commit to it for a long time. A good one to tackle if  you're laid up with a broken leg, perhaps.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|my wife plays these all the time on the computer so I downloaded this for her. She couldn't get into it but I'm hooked now!Great game with lots of variety.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok i guess i mean its 101 games in one ok not worth money but ok for free  do not geg
B005VTS4EY|4.0|can't stop playing! I hate if i can't figure it out on the first try. everyone should play this game.
B001HN6918|4.0|I'm annoyed by people who think good animated films can only be appreciated by kids. The first KFP was hysterical, wistful and encouraging to anyone who dreams. The second one was almost as good, but I found my mind wandering on occasion, though I watched it under the same circumstances as the first. The entire cast maintains the sense of fun and commitment, and I was very entertained.<br /><br />It's not Shrek or Wall-E, but certainly as good as Rango, regarding a little guy up against seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Little kids can learn from that, and adult \\"kids\\" as well, if they pay attention and don't write it off as insignificant. Animated films are not the same as \\"cartoons\\". The Academy and Globes and almost every other awards group has a special category for Animated Features. Yes, animation has come a long way.<br /><br />Watch the violence and horror of \\"Pinocchio\\" (1940) and decide if you really wanna let your little kids watch it...
B003U4ZU7Q|5.0|I have absolutely no issues with how this series ended. I just finished it watching it through for a second time. What a show! For me personally, the best ever. And this episode was the only way it could of ended, and they did it perfectly. When everyone \\"finds\\" each other and remembers... those moments are so special, so beautiful. Perfect!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Well worth the price.  This is a great game that will challenge you and keep you entertained.  Curious to see how much I'll remember when I restart it in a few weeks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|so much to read up on. it has everything on it, and plan topics you complete. i really like this app!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Ha! I bought Appetite on Vinyl, the last vinyl album I bought before I went all cd, so when I bought this CD at a yard sale today I had no idea it<br />was the GHits in the sleeve, as I had only ever seen the vinyl. Funny, though, There are a few extras here not on Appetite, so it all worked out.
B007H7XRLI|4.0|Movies are for entertainment and I thought this movie was fun and entertaining. Some people are so overly critical of a movie it's actually funny. I thought the acting and fight scenes were very well done. It wasn't the greatest movie I have ever seen, but worth having on my blue-ray shelf.
B005NQ5LSC|4.0|Great fighting scenes and the beginning of the Ip Man sagas. No Donnie Yen but this guy is just as good. A good way of learning why Ip Man was the way he was.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun and works very good on my kindle fire. The reason why I give this app four stars is because it goes to web way to much I think but other then that it is a really fun game
1452101248|4.0|I am a home chef and have a great cookbook collection. A friend recommended this book to me. I haven't purchased a cookbook in over a year because I felt that  I had everything I needed and that there wasn't much new under the sun as far as flavor profiles. This book opened up new flavor profiles for me and ingredient  ideas I would never have thought of. Love this book. If nothing else, purchase it for the pictures.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a very fun game similar to the PC version. Have fun defeating the zombies using garden. It is not compatible with the 4.0.3 Droid firmware update of Asus Transformer. Hoping this is fixed because I'm not sure the family can handle life without Plants vs. Zombies ;)
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Such a great little amp for the cost. It's great for any portable setup imaginable. Right now i have this thing hooked up to my Sandisk Clip Zip, i just velcroed them on; it might be the smallest audiophile setup in the world! If anyone is saying that this little guy doesn't make a difference, they don't know what they're talking about right now it's powering my DT 990 Pro 250 ohms absolutely fine. Sure they're not loud enough to hurt my ears, but who wants that anyway? I'm sure at one point in the future i'll upgrade to a better amp, but for a really small really portable one, i couldn't be any happier with my purchase.
B006O5YI7G|1.0|this was a crappy movie dont watch it<br /><br />watch butch cassidy and the sundace kid if you want a better western movie
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I missed this in the theater and was so happy that Amazon had it available for me to watch on my laptop on the tedious trip from Jax to Melbourne FL. in the passengers seat of course.  I read the mixed reviews and I have to disagree with the negative comments. I am not a film critic, but I thought the movie was brilliant. Some people complained there was not enough ACTION or Fast and Furious-esque Drama.  I applaud all of the Artists, Writers, Directors, Crew etc... for having the artistic depth to make a film that brought me through a broad spectrum of emotions. The actors and actresses were brilliant. These characters made my brain run the gauntlet from Anger to Passion, to Adrenaline Rush to Calm Serenity and left me in awe. Some people may find it boring for whatever reason. I cannot fault them for their feelings, but perhaps one day they may realize the error of their ways!!  So, to whom it may concern, I thank you for making a movie with a name like DRIVE, not be some sort of knock off Fast and Furious #17 or whatever sequel they are making now, or some cliche Gone in 60 Seconds spin off. I don't think that was the goal of the writer. Perhaps the writer was trying to reach us on a much higher level of cognizance and understanding of humanity. Thank you for the delightful surprise!!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|first of all let me start by saying if you haven't seen this movie you need to. The film is an adaptation of edgar rice burrough's classic novel \\"A princess of mars\\" now it goes without saying that the story of captain john carter is the grandfather of all science fiction which influenced such filmmakers as George Lucas (star wars) and james cameron (avatar) but then again due to disney's misguided name change and marketing you may not...<br /><br />The story is of a spiritualty broken Virginian calvary man (carter) who is transported to mars in the midst of a war between alien species<br /><br />But it's so much more than that it has an old timely feel that reminds you of the golden age of sci/fi don't get me wrong I loved avatar but the story doesn't resonate with you the way that john carter does...filled with amazing visuals, deep characters, and enough action to satisfy any Michael bay fan but at its truest form john carter is a love story about a man far away from home that falls in love with a princess<br /><br />Lastly I ask you not to get caught in the hype of the budget or Disney's fiscal earnings or the onslaught of bad reviews in the beginning (although mostly all positive have come out sense) and go into this movie and appriciate it for all it is.....a triumph in cinematic storytelling
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this as it is easy to access and cards move easily.  I like the auto complete when you have won.
B001BY15RQ|5.0|As Bowie himself says \\"I was Ziggy\\" when this album was recorded. This is a great album, I did not even know it exsisted. I just happened upon it and decided to buy. It is a great recording that captures them live. The sound quality is very good
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I'm willing to go all the way on this movie. Even with it's fast pace, it takes time to touch down and establish it's history. More over, it continues to be debated amoung fans, just as the Carpenter 82 film has been for the past 30 years. Dare I say, classic?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So first have wiki open as there were some terms,acts, words that I had to look up! And this book was fantastic! I read the entire trilogy in two days and am now re reading it to see what I missed. Loved it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|like it. it'd be better without the ads but can't ask too much for free. plays nice. doesn't drop. enjoyable.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this for my kindle fire! Helps protect from scratches, I just wish they had more colors. Fitts perfect and shipped very fast came in same time kindle fire came. recommend for any one with the Kindle Fire.

B001R60ESE|5.0|If you are a Chris Botti fan, or if you are a jazz and or classical fan, this is a Blu-Ray you should own. Botti is polished, his band outstanding and his guest artists among the best in music. Why watch TV when you can watch and listen to music like this? I am trying to be patient for Chris Botti's next release and even better, his next vist to Austin where I can again see/hear him live. His concert here was possibly THE best concert I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was excited to read this book after all of the great reviews and at first I was delighted. I love a good romance, and I liked Fifty and Ana's characters. And then it started getting erotic, and then it started getting dark. And then I stopped reading because I felt extremely uncomfortable.<br /><br />But I wanted to know what was going to happen between Fifty and Ana and I wanted to know what his secrets were. So I continued reading and I am glad that I did, because asides from the constant sex, there was actually a story there that I enjoyed. I guess I am a sap for man falls deeply in love and they live happily ever after type stories.<br /><br />This is a great trilogy and I read all 3 books in less than a week. E L James is a talented writer. I just wish that there wasn't so much sex in the novels as it was a bit off-putting; especially the stuff that goes down in the red room aka playroom. Fifty was also a bit too dark for me.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Needs substantial interface improvement (landscape vs. portrait switch) and ability to apply tools while zoomed among many others.  Don't buy unless these issues are corrected and the Kindle Fire 6.3 problem is corrected.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like books that end neatly and sweetly. Maybe because life isn't that way, it allows me to dream. The last book in the trilogy was somewhat annoying. Fifty annoyed me. He was too needy, forgive me, but he was. I still loved him though, but he annoyed me.<br /><br />Also, some of the facts in the books had me laughing because they were so unbelievable. The fact that Fifty made $100,000 an hour and how the paparazzi were always after them in Seattle made me raise my eyebrows. But all of the out-there information didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />It's a good trilogy that romantics will enjoy. You just have to not let all the sex get to you. And the BDSM stuff was very off-putting to me. But I did enjoy the story.
B006UG90RM|2.0|Not even worth being paid to own this one. I have been a Fan since the Beginning.<br />I know repeated listens are required sometimes. 2 songs aside this is a load of Lazy Filler!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was my favorite book of the trilogy. This is the book where I feel in love with Fifty and his relationship with Ana. Surprisingly, I eventually got fed up of how much they needed to tell each other they loved each other, and how much they had sex. It got to the point where I was like, omg, here we go again.<br /><br />However, I loved the side-plots and I loved how much they loved each other. This is a love story that all women want to be a part of if they are true romantics. And in a way that makes me feel a bit sad because the story is so unrealistic and the relationship was so not healthy. But fiction and is fiction and this was engaging and enjoyable.<br /><br />Btw, who else hates Mrs. Robinson?

B00729GQ0A|3.0|2.5-3<br />OK, I have mixed feelings on this book. Reading it was an experience good and bad. It was all over the place. The story was interesting the world was unique and had so much potential....but the author keep going off on extreme details that had nothing to do with the story. I think she has great potential, with a really good editor. Her world building was very good as was her character development. Fantastic characters ! Edited I think it could jump to a 4 star. Really a great job for a first book. I will watch for future books from this author.
B0031Y4A94|5.0|If you got the equipment to appreciate Vinyl the this will make you very happy indeed! I would encourage you to buy this and replace your old worn out copy!
0439023491|5.0|In Catching Fire Katniss must again enter the Hunger Games arena and continue to pretend her star-crossed love affair with Peeta. They have become the faces of rebellion and the capital is angry.<br /><br />The Good: Catching Fire is more of the fast-paced, action oriented storytelling that fans of The Hunger Games crave. There are new characters to meet, new challenges for Katniss Everdeen to overcome and more dangers from the ominous capital. Katniss herself has become more sophisticated. She's growing up and her growth is fun to watch. Catching Fire ends with one heck of a cliffhanger.<br /><br />The Bad: There is something lacking in the developing love triangle. While Katniss must pretend to love one beau while brooding over another, there is little distinction between the two.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: If you enjoyed The Hunger Games you won't be disappointed with Catching Fire. The middle installments of some trilogies are a let down, but Catching Fire builds the trilogy and advances it with more enjoyable, fast-paced storytelling.<br /><br />Visit trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com for more of my reviews.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book collection was worth the wait and was the perfect set for me.  I did not have to get each one separately and could just read my way through the story!!  It is well done!! My only concern is the to the death for the ages it is said to be for.  I could picture it on a movie screen and can see it being a block buster for all of them!!

B002MQYOFW|2.0|Interesting premise.  The author has claimed this came about as an odd convergence of \\"Survivor\\" and the Iraq war. But this is obviously nothing more than an Americanized \\"Battle Royale\\", with what I assume the author believed was more flesh and thought.  However, adding a detailed, moment-by-moment narrative does not do that.  It kept just enough momentum (when I skipped over the drawn out details) to make me finish it.  However, as often as not it worked well to put me asleep on several occasions.<br />Characterizations are inconsistent, the main character fluctuating between around ten and thirty years old in action and attitude. It was somewhat disconcerting and distracting.  Also, there is no real feel for the main character.  Perhaps she is meant to be emotionless, but that carries over to the rest of the book.  During what I assume was to be one of the more emotional scenes, all I could conjure was \\"OK, lets get on with it...\\".<br /><br />The dystopian feel is entirely contrived.  While this is oh so obviously intended to make the reader detest the government, I was more disgusted with the thought of parents overtly willing to allow there children to be sent to almost certain death.  This is perhaps good as quick entertainment and a mindless read to spend time.<br /><br />This a served to pull me out of the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre.  Overall, not a good read.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|'I didn't think I belonged here in her world, a boy stuck between two lives, dragging the dangers of the wolves with me, but when she said my name, waiting for me to follow, I knew I'd do anything to stay with her.'<br /><br />There was something incredibly beautiful about Maggie Stiefvater's writing style... I found myself completely mesmerized. I definitely have a soft spot in my heart for beautifully written stories that fill me with a deep longing... and this one definitely did it. Sam and Grace's passion was palpable and heartbreaking. These too definitely had a connection that lacked an easy explanation; it just was.<br /><br />As this is the first time I've read Shiver, I've heard opinions about this book from every end of the spectrum. The one that stuck out the most for me was that it was 'Twilight' rewritten if Bella were to have went with Jacob instead of Edward. Being that I have now personally read 'Shiver' and can formulate my own opinion I can see some slight similarities but there was a depth to the characters and the story itself that was sorely lacking in Twilight... plus the writing itself was on a completely different level.<br /><br />Incredibly enjoyable, I loved every minute of it. I can't help but wonder though what the next installment will bring. If I didn't know that the second (and third) book was already released I would have been completely content with how this story ended. I suppose we shall see. :)<br /><br />'I closed my eyes. For a brief moment I wished with all my heart that he was just a normal boy, so that I could storm away with my pride and indignation. But he wasn't. He was as fragile as a butterfly in autumn, waiting to be destroyed by the first frost.'

Unusual (but not outlandish), unexpected characters, all of whom will touch your heart in various ways.  Lovely study of everyday humanity, and just how much we are --- and are not --- able to help others who are struggling.

0307352145|5.0|Quiet by Susan Cain<br /><br />We often pride ourselves on being able to identify certain types of people.  This is especially true of extroversion and introversion.  We use terms like `shy', `quiet,' `a people person,' `outgoing,' and `talkative' to describe them, usually knowing that these terms point to introverts and extroverts.  What we're not as good at is recognize why people react certain ways and when it is better to act introverted or when it is better to act extroverted.<br /><br />Susan Cain subtitled her book, \\"The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.\\"  An introvert herself, her main focus is introversion.  One of the key factors in determining what someone is, is their level of sensitivity.  Introverts, she writes, are more sensitive to stimuli and more easily overwhelmed.  She explains that this is why introverts prefer interacting with smaller groups of people, tend to not enjoy public speaking as much, and tend to prefer working in environments with less external noise.  An important thing to note here: When Susan writes about qualities typically embodied in introverts they are often generalization.  In many people they may be true, but it others it will be false.  Some introverts are perfectly fine with public speaking while some extroverts have terrible stage fright.<br /><br />Throughout her book, Susan uses many case studies of introverts and extroverts.  Some of them are well known, such as her opening look at Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks.  Other people she highlights are everyday people, such as a couple in which one is extroverted and one is introverted.<br /><br />One of Susan's fears is that in culture's such as America, extroversion is held on too high a pedestal.  More schools are moving to group based learning, extroverted leaders are assumed to be stronger leaders who people will follow.  Introverts are too often described as shy, which is not always accurate, but nonetheless widely used.  This isn't to say that introverts should be held above extroverts, but Susan argues that both are needed.<br /><br />She recounts several studies throughout the book, such as one that showed extroverted groups led by an introverted leader had high productivity than introverted groups with an extroverted leader.  She also has a chapter on group think and the dangers that it presents, especially since many environments are moving to meetings and group work for major decisions.<br /><br />She also looks at introverts/extroverts in the church, in businesses, and in school rooms.  She gives some ideas to introverts on how to act in situations where they feel out of their comfort zone as well as how to understand extroverts.  She also gives ideas to extroverts on how to understand, and accommodate when needed, introverts.  One `side' is not better than the other, but each should give and take.<br /><br />I don't often list a book as a `must-read,' however this is the closest a book has come in a while.  If you're looking to better understand extroverts, or especially introverts, then I highly recommend this book.  If you're already very well read on the subject then the book may not be as interesting, but this is the first book I have read on the subject and I found it fascinating.<br /><br />Really, the biggest down side the book is the ugly cover, but I won't hold that against it.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars<br /><br />I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group as part of their Blogging for Books program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255

B0071WQ7WU|3.0|I have been a die hard Shinedown fan since the 1st album and couldn't wait to hear the new one. They're one of the few bands that I've LOVED every song on the CD's... until now.  The reason I love the band so much is the \\"reach into your soul and grab you\\" lyrics... you just feel so connected to the songs, not to mention the great guitar licks, and Brent's amazing vocals. Amaryllis is a disappointment and I truly hate saying that about my favorite band. I think it's a bit to \\"mainstream\\" and well kind of like every other band on the radio.  Before this album Shinedown stood out from the rest but it's just not there on this one, nothing \\"stand out\\" it's just \\"ok.\\" Don't expect a \\"45\\" on this album because it's not even close.  I guess the album is decent for your average band but not up to par for Shinedown.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Well conceived app. Works well and rarely has performance issues. I would recommend this app to anyone. Local news would be a good addition.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|great book.  kept me rivited until the end.  I will definitely look up other books by this author. Definitely worth reading
0061992860|5.0|A must have for the user! Unless you were in the military and have a photographic memory! Covers 99% of what u need to survive! And fits in coat pocket and most pants. A must read and carry in backpack or car. Also great for letting u know which supplies u need, so u don't carry extra weight.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|There are so many combinations! It's interesting to match things and see what they come out to be. When I start playing this game I can't stop. At times it can be frustrating, but that just makes it fun. This is definitely one of my all time favorite apps to play.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Using on my kindle fire &amp; it is great! different options and card movement are good. I would recommend this game.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great app..love the way it reads it out loud to you on kindle fire with touch of button.  Only way they could  make it better is to add shortcut to be able to pick by books of the Bible. Hope they update to add that feature soon!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I have much of Peter Garbriel's music and New Blood is a wonderful new approach to Gabriel's former catalog of songs.  New Blood offers new dimesions to his greatest songs making use of an actual orchestra.  Imagine what many pop or alternative musicians could accomplish if they had an entire orchestra at their disposal!<br /><br />My personal favorites here are:  \\"Solsbury Hill\\", \\"Downside Up\\", \\"Red Rain\\", and \\"Blood Of Eden\\".  By the way this double album places its 2 best songs as bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  (Peter Gabriel has always had a tendancy to have his listeners dig deep into his ablums to find the best songs).  The version of \\"In Your Eyes\\" on this album differs greatly from Gabriel's original pop song but it does offer a new and interesting appraoch to an already great song.<br /><br />New Blood is beautiful in composition, and if you already a fan of Gabriel's you owe it to yourself to purchase this openly refreshing take on many of his greatest songs.  There are no regrets here. You won't be disappointed!
0307749495|3.0|I am a huge Reacher fan and I have been a bit disappointed in the last two books. But I bought the audiobook for $30.00..unabridged version...and wished to God I had bought the abridged version. I don't know about everybody else, but the \\"romantic scenes\\" became painful and totally overdone. The 3 paragraph descriptions of every little thing in the town drove me crazy.<br /><br />I always liked Reacher because he is tough, fair and is willing to do what is right...get the bad guys...with no hesitation or remorse and he still is. But I don't need a minute description of every little thing and I have now decided I will NEVER buy another unabridged version of his books. I will just read them on my Nook, so I can skip what my husband and I both called \\"crap\\".<br /><br />Sorry Mr. Child but you need to do better. At least Reacher doesn't shrug his way out of trouble anymore. That is an improvement.
B00026WU64|4.0|Father-in-law and his brother too, both US Marines South Pacific WWII.  Knew the Belleau Wood story generally, but wanted to look further into it.  Good book, reads quickly, lots of pictures.<br /><br />Damn politicians....they should have to walk into the field of fire from a machine gun emplacement.  Like the cornfield at Antietam, fine young men ordered to walk into certain slaughter...their bravery is incredible.
1607885743|3.0|Unfortunately, I bought the audiobook. It is about 12 cds, I am only on disc 6 and I am so bored I could cry! I just finished listening to the new Jack Reacher book and I never should have started this right after. I have always been a Baldacci fan but this one is putting me to sleep. It repeats things about the coal mining business..over and over again. The back and forth between the hero and heroine is almost juvenile!<br /><br />I think maybe this wouldn't be so bad if I had bought the written word. I could skim a lot of the mining minutea and the silly back and forth between the heroes.<br /><br />All in all it is ok, but barely!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game. Would be 5 stars if it notified when no more moves are available. Would still recommend though.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but this turned out to be a very well done little movie, with plot twists that you would never anticipate. Go see it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I got this book for my birthday and at first I wasn't very intrested in reading it. Then, when I did start reading it, I couldn't put it down! It was SO good!  Dashner keeps your wheels turning. Always a new problem right after another. He keeps you sucked into the story, making everything come alive, especially the Greivers. My favorite character was Newt. He always cared for his friend, Alby. He may have been tough on the outside, but he was a softy inside. James did a wonderful job creating a world that I would never thought was possible! Cheers to James and all those who worked hard to make this book real! This is totally a number 1 book! I hope the next two books are as food and I look forward to reading them! :]
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Whoever rated Sherlock Holmes II the worst movie of the year, obviously didn't see Cowboys and Aliens. It was just plain silly with no coherent plot and nothing making any sense. If you want to see good thoughtful and thought-provoking recent science fiction movies watch \\"Moon\\" or \\"Source Code\\". Cowboys and Aliens is just a junk movie.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is really fun & challenging.  There are 3 different ways to play and different challenges for each mode that keeps it interesting. The ads don't bother me at all and don't interfere with the game play.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was hooked with this book for the first 2/3rds.  Thereafter it just went on and on and on......  Very imaginative and descriptive.  The writing was wonderful.  Easy flow,, good descriptions of what could be perceived as a difficult matter to interpret.  In any event, if the story had stopped earlier I probably would have given this book a 5 star, but it truly dragged toward the end.

B007MNV5WU|2.0|So the free version came out for android and you could buy it on the amazon app store... so why isn't it compatible with the AMAZON kindle fire???? This makes no sense to me. If its an amazon product and its in the amazon app store why the heck wouldn't they offer it on kindle fire. I refuse to pay $3 for angry birds. Lets go amazon you need to care more about your customers than squeezing every penny you can out of us. Even apple offers one version for $.99 ..........................
B004J4WKS8|4.0|So far so good! Down 6.2 pounds after 19 days and really liking how my body feels when not eating carbs! I find the book easy to follow, and the science behind the plan is easy to understand - it makes sense. I have been eating my oat bran as cooked cereal some days (with brown sugar sugartwin) instead of a galette evey day and I like this option.  Eating all this protein fills you up and I am not hungry between meals. Fat free Greek yogurt is my new best friend!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|For those who have seen Community before you you can formulate your own opinion on whether you like or dislike this show, I am just writing this review to let you know Community is just as good if not better in these first two seasons as it is in its current season (3rd).<br /><br />For all those who haven't seen this show definitely check it out it is hilarious definitely in the same class(no pun intended) as Arrested Development when your talking about classic comedies.  All the characters are flawed and realistic; reminiscent of the office before it went down hill, if you liked the first few seasons of The Office you will almost definitely (99.9% chance)like this show a lot. The situations are anything but normal, there are situations where you will be shaking your head but you will also be laughing hysterically at the same time (Chevy Chase has many of these moments). I have friends that did not like The Office at all but love Community so I don't want to pigeon-toe this series by simply describing it as \\"similar to The Office\\" because this really is a very unique series....so watch this show! This is definitely the cream of the crop when it comes to television comedies.

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film.

0307593312|4.0|If you ask me who my favorite author is, I will say it's Murakami. If you ask me what my favorite book is of all time I will say it's A Wind-up Bird Chronicle. I have read everything he has written and I always get excited when a new book comes out. That said, this one is a real slog and it took me a long time to get through. I put it down for long periods of time.<br /><br />When I started it, like most of his books the early passages transported me to another world and I was fascinated. Then I lost my way. But when I finished it, the message hit me hard. It made me realize how disconnected we are from our pasts and how the me today is so different from the me of yesterday to the extent that it feels like I somehow also shifted to a completely different world.<br />This hit me like an epiphany and for that, the slog was worth it and I give it four stars.<br /><br />But I also wish Murakami would tone down the preaching a bit as it's tiring. In his latter books, when he takes an interest in something he wants to force the reader to be interested in it as well, even though it has nothing to do with the plot.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo is the world, the whole of civilisation - a protection from the deadly outside. Those who don't agree will be sent to clean.<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" is a five part story set in a post-apocalyptic world where the outside atmosphere is poisonous and a large underground silo has held humanity for hundreds of years. Let me start by saying the first part of this story was one of the best that I've read for a long time. It was a surprising introduction to life in the Silo through the eyes of its sheriff, Holston, as he chooses a course of action which haunts the rest of the story. It is through this character that we're introduced to the concept of cleaning. By the end of part one, we know that \\"Wool\\" is set not only in a post-apocalyptic world but also in a dystopian society.<br /><br />It's not actually until part three of the book that the main character comes to the fore but by then we're already seeing the ripple effect of Holston's decision as we're further briefed on life in the Silo. We also meet some of the other major players in the drama that follows.<br /><br />As we progress, it won't be surprising to find that the false utopia of the Silo is upset along with some occasionally startling revelations about different characters, their motivations and the history of the Silo itself. But I think it would be unfair to go much further than that in this review as I found the unwrapping of this gift so enjoyable that I would not want to spoil it for anyone else. I will summarise by saying that the tension built progressively, the revelations seemed to occur right on cue and the action scenes in the real \\"meat\\" of the drama left me sufficiently breathless and clicking the page turn button in anticipation. It was a really great read.<br /><br />The characters in this book were well developed. Even relatively minor players seemed to be fleshed out more than I would have expected. It was easy to become invested in Juliette, the protagonist. I felt that I knew her. Her strong sense of duty and her tough, analytical mind tempered with an emotional depth made her easy to root for. But I also felt very familiar with Bernard. As head of IT in the context of the Silo he had some huge responsibilities and I believe I could appreciate them. I didn't picture him as a power-hungry dictator that I needed to despise, but rather a tortured soul who bore the weight of knowledge and responsibility that others could not guess. I did feel right at the end that there was a slight inconsistency in his actions and I was a bit disappointed that this tainted my view of him somewhat, but it was a small thing and the scene itself was impressive enough that it didn't even occur to me until sometime afterwards. Rather than perform the same task of describing each character, let me finish by saying that for most characters introduced, I ended up with a clear picture of what they looked like and could almost see their expressions and actions as if watching a movie. I believe the author worked hard to give life to this cast.<br /><br />The prose in \\"Wool\\" flows well, leaves me with a fairly vivid picture of settings, actions and characters and is almost entirely error free. I never found myself wanting to change phrases or re-imagine sentences to remove awkwardness. The language itself is not overly sophisticated, but neither is it too simplistic. In fact, the best compliment I could pay is that the prose itself seemed to vanish almost entirely as I progressed through the story.<br /><br />The author seems intent on adding to the world of \\"Wool\\" with future stories and novels and I embrace that decision and look forward to more adventures. I'm now going to quickly praise myself for not gushing during this review (a fairly strong temptation) and finish by saying that if you like dystopian/post-apocalyptic fiction, you should be purchasing this now and moving it to the top of your list of required reading. I don't think you'll be disappointed.strong sense of duty and her tough, analytical mind tempered with an emotional depth made her easy to root for. But I also felt very familiar with Bernard.

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|~I really love this series because it reminds me of the Hunger Games. A Society that controls everything, just like the Capitol. It is very exciting. You get very caught up in the book and how different it is from now. It is so different from the way we live today. It makes you think about what it could be like. Like... Could it stop crime? obesity? destroying the environment? I absolutely love this book. I would encourage others to read this book.~

I purchased a set as a gift too, but figured out it was far more economical to purchase the carousel with them as a set, which I didn't do, but wish I had.  Unfortunately, you can't buy the carousel separately so be forewarned.  But, this set performs just right and looks awesome.  And best of all, no more utensils on the counter.  I plan to order the spooned spatulas too.

0670022411|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I absolutely loved it. The mix of history, romance, supernatural, and good plot had me hooked. Other reviews talk about how slow it is but I could not put it down. Then again I love history and little details about things. I also found the plot engaging and well paced. I was shocked to see the bad reviews, as I really cant think of much I disliked about this book. It's a fun, nonserious book about vampires, witches, daemons,  history, and conflict. If you like history, fantasy and not too serious ploy you'll enjoy it!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Caution: Spoiler alert!,<br />The writing style of the book was good.  Beyond that, I could not find anything to like about the 3. Main characters.<br /><br />The father, in particular, is indefensible . He hides a murder weapon, he learns of Jacob's propensity for killing small animals and visiting torture rooms on the Internet.  And he is the district attorney on the case of a teenagers murder.  His robotic devotion to his son's innocence is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />Then there is the red herring of the \\"murder gene\\" in his family.  It goes no where except to help get his son off.  Most heinous of all is that he then takes his son and wife to Jamaca where Jabcob murders another girl ( similar to the Natalie holloway story where the father protects his son).<br /><br />They return to the USA.  The only credible thing for me in the whole book was what.the mother did in the end.<br /><br />I hated this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hmm...I read the hype so I read the book....<br /><br />I haven't read the Twilight series (reading this book makes me less likely to pick those up) so I'll have to trust the other reviewers who said they are similar.  As another reviewer stated, I don't much like giving negative reviews but was so appalled I had to speak up.<br /><br />First, on the good side...I liked the beginning.  I expect this author can write better than she did in this book.  It reads to me like she decided to add sex to the Twilight concept and try to reach a mass audience.  Which she did and I am in awe of how well this book has done (she's a genius).<br /><br />But...<br /><br />At first I was going to give the book two stars but then I read another review which pointed out how glamorized and idealized the author makes Christian's lifestyle/sexual quirks.  I had a friend surprised by a boyfriend with like tastes and I can tell you the realistic experience is a far cry away from a hot guy who buys you cars and computers then hits you a few times.  The message of this book is destructive to those who actually decide to follow the heroine's lead; especially girls who are \\"innocent\\".  There are a lot of men who won't buy you a closet full of clothes after you agree to a mostly sexual relationship.<br /><br />The other reason I gave this book one star is because the characters and story line are so unbelievable and sloppy.  I can go with bad writing, but sloppy?  Ana gets drunk for the first time early in the book then later has four Cosmos with her mom (which she doesn't seem to think is a lot), drinking mostly on an empty stomach.  So she's such a lush she can drink an awful lot before getting drunk?<br /><br />Ana is so annoying as a character I agree with the reviewers who said it's hard to believe any man would fall in so helplessly in love with her, let alone a hot billionaire.  If you like heroines who vomit on men from too much alcohol, bring up ex-girlfriends to fight about them, aremean and demanding and threaten men you will love Ana.  What makes her interesting or such a catch?  Read the book and if you find out (I didn't) please post in a review.<br /><br />Christian is funny.  He is outwardly perfect, inwardly crazy.  Again, the book sends a bad message that stalking is romantic. I just had to wonder how he made so much money if all he did was follow Ana everywhere and respond almost immediately to her emails.  The people I know that are young and self made actually work.  If men were really like this, buying you things, perfect in bed, gorgeous and nice all the time no matter how badly you treat them...oh, wait, you get the point now?  Like Ana, he's more a cartoon character than a real one.  This story makes Pretty Woman look believable (and isn't so different).<br /><br />I likewise struggled to finish the book.  On the kids show my children watch the friend who keeps texting her boyfriend back and forth and reading the silly messages to all is a joke, not a novel.  If you like reading cutesy emails (about kinky sexual things..not something a man who makes his girlfriend sign an NDA would ever send) you'll love this book; I eventually had to skim those.<br /><br />So, I would have given two stars for being a really well crafted marketing exercise if not for the bad messages and sloppy, silly story.<br /><br />And the sex - well I was once told that sex and violence are the two hardest things to write - and this books shows the challenges inherent in a book of this sort.  The sex scenes are repetitive and not so erotic; they read cheap.  Sometimes it's what you don't say not what you do that makes a visual interesting.<br /><br />I'd still recommend reading the book to those curious; it has really caught on and become a huge hit and thus I may be in the minority.  Looking for a light, idealized Cinderella story why not read about Christian, who on one level is every woman's fantasy (and the related dangers are all in the book).  As a \\"good\\" book no; I'd classify it differently.  My kids will hopefully not read this book until they are old enough to realize how destructive the message is for those, like Ana, who don't know better.
0439023513|4.0|Trilogies don't always end well. The story will almost never end in a manner that leaves everyone feeling satisfied. Whether it be the direction the author takes the story, the inevitable fates of beloved characters, or the conclusion that binds them all together. Fortunately, I found that Mockingjay succeeded in giving a proper conclusion to a incredibly emotional journey, although it isn't perfect in its execution.<br /><br />Upon being rescued from her second foray into the Hunger Games, Katniss has found herself among an army of rebels living in District 13, the same District 13 that was supposedly destroyed by the Capitol for their previous rebellion. Katniss has become the symbol of hope in Panem's fight for freedom: the Mockingjay. If the rebels are to stand a chance of defeating the seemingly unstoppable Capitol, Katniss must adopt the charismatic persona that District 13 deems necessary. All the while she must contend with her own psychological war with President Snow.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy has had a very cohesive evolution in its storytelling that flowed perfectly from each book. The Hunger Games showcased the nightmare of living under a totalitarian government and the atrocities they can inflict. This led to Catching Fire, which was a subtle social commentary on the individual's will to defy an evil regime and how it can inspire other people to join their cause. This all culminates in Mockingjay, which focuses on the horrors of war through the eyes of children. It possesses a very different feel than its predecessors but fits perfectly well in the over-arching framework of the trilogy. Suzanne Collins once again demonstrates her astuteness as a writer, completely rejecting obvious cliches of cigar-chomping acts of bravado and instead focuses on the physical and psychological ramifications wars have on human beings. It's an incredibly powerful political statement on the many behind-the-scenes factors of war that may seem lost in today's mainstream perception. These themes never felt forced or shoved down the reader's throat, it's more than possible to simply enjoy it as the intended conclusion. Dig deeper though and you'll find a thought-provoking stance on conflict that exudes a strong sense of humanity.<br /><br />Despite the ever present Capitol's denial, District 13 wasn't destroyed during the Dark Days and is fortunately given a believable reason for its continued existence. District 13 itself has grown into a heavily militaristic society with aspects in the vain of communism. They're the enemy of the Capitol, but they aren't perfect either. Collins understands that war almost never has any perfectly good sides. Despite the honest nature of soldiers, politicians may possess hidden agendas that benefit their own personal sociological and political views. Wars are fought for inner held beliefs, ideologies, or a beacon of hope. Yet sometimes in the madness of war these ideals can be forgotten, or even worse, twisted into something grotesque. District 13 and its leaders perfectly summarize this morally grey tone of wartime politics. Katniss and the rebels share a common foe in which they are committed to destroy; but is the future they envision truly a better one? Who are the real villains in the masquerade of war?<br /><br />A predominant running theme the trilogy has encompassed is the use of propaganda to manipulate the perception of the masses, particularly through controlled mass media or transforming an individual's outward appearance and personality to reflect their views. The Capitol dressed and pampered Katniss for her supposed slaughter at the Hunger Games, tried to redefine her as a less inspiring figure in Catching Fire, and now District 13 wants to utilize her as their beacon of hope in their self-righteous war against a tyrannical regime. Collins really does an excellent job showcasing this running theme from both sides of the war, having Katniss's simple image pretentiously blown out ofproportion for the rebel's war effort, only then to have it demonized by the Capitol's redundant attempts of maintaining control. A personal identity crisis such as this can have insurmountably negative affects on the individual's psyche; Katniss can't be herself, she must be the image the rebels require her to be. This in some ways makes District 13 no better than the totalitarianism they ever so valiantly fight to destroy.<br /><br />It pains me to say that Mockingjay is the only book in the trilogy that I feel suffers from an awkward pacing. The book definitely started off strong, showcasing the existence of the rebellion and the grieving sadness derived from the devastation of war. The problem falls in Katniss being sidelined when in the confines of District 13 for a very large chunk of the book. It makes sense in the context of the story since only a fool would send their symbol of morale into a potentially hazardous situation by choice. Her death would demoralize the rebels and give morale to the Capitol, completely turning the war effort in the enemy's favor. The downside is that it severely cripples the narrative, Katniss's non-involvement makes the reader feel less attached to the war and the horrors which it entails. She's the reader's intangible link to Collin's fictional world, her separation from the conflict makes for a very disconnected feel with the events that transpire. At its worst, it prevents Katniss from being the incredibly strong heroine that I've come to know and love. She never loses her courage, she just isn't given much opportunity to use it until much later in the book. The reader feels more like a spectator instead of an inhabitant of the dystopia, which is something Collins did in the Hunger Games better than any author I've seen before. I had originally planned to give Mockingjay a three star rating and consider it a step down from the previous books, that is until I reached the second half of the story. It follows the same structurethat Collins has established for the trilogy, the first half serving as exposition and world-building while the latter half serves as the more action-oriented section. The events that take place during the second half of Mockingjay don't share the same déjà vu feeling that Catching Fire suffered from with its repeat of the Hunger Games. While I disliked the pacing of the book's first half, the whole thing just clicked for me once I reached this point. Katniss and the reader truly get to experience the harrowing sensation of battle, the burden of leadership, and the undeserved fate of anyone caught in the crossfire. It's entertaining, heart-wrenching, and deeply thought-provoking. It's all done so incredibly well that I feel it actually made up for the book's disjointed feel.<br /><br />I've also constantly praised the love triangle in these books due to its abandonment of the painfully cliche romances that teen novels usually rely on. This was a character-driven romance, not a sexual one, which I why it was so endearing. I never felt like it left the formula that Collins established, even if some moments felt somewhat contrived when compared to the larger scheme of events. It concludes the way I feel most people wanted it to myself included. What didn't feel as conclusive were the several minor characters that are introduced in Mockingjay. Their deaths lack the emotional impact that Collins intended simply because we know nothing about them, thus their end falls flat when compared to the demise of more established characters.<br /><br />The ending of this book is by far the most emotionally-draining tear-jerking conclusion I've ever read in my life. It's the kind of ending that will keep you up at 2am to see how it eventually unfolds, I know I did. It's superbly malicious in the way we've come to expect from Suzanne Collins's masterful manipulation of our emotions and thus a worthy ending to the Hunger Games trilogy that'll make you both smile and cry. With that said, I believe people are really overreacting to how the book ended. Wars and revolutions always come at a dire cost, Collins simply demonstrated this in a way that she knew would make the reader care. Physical wounds may heal over time but emotional ones stay with people forever. Consider every man or woman who comes home from war with such horrible memories fresh on their mind, are they supposed to just naturally adapt back to everyday life? The only thing that can help these injured souls get by is love from another human being.<br /><br />This would have been a five out of five if it wasn't for the unfortunate pacing issues. Mockingjay is an incredible introspective on the horrors of war and a worthy conclusion to one of the most emotionally powerful trilogies I've ever read.
B0000248VB|5.0|Bought this for my Dad while sitting in a Dr's office. He mentioned that he'd been looking for it for awhile and couldn't  find it. I pulled out my iPad, went to Amazon, did a search, pressed a button and he owned it 4 days later. He was absolutely amazed and is enjoying the music!!

0439023513|1.0|I can appreciate what Suzanne Collins was trying for. War and its aftermath shouldn't be wrapped up in a shiny bow. But the second and especially, third book are like a punishment to us for having been so entertained by the first one. I don't really believe that was the intention.<br /><br />SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br /><br />The Hunger Games compels you to keep reading, but almost all of its strengths are missing from the second and third books. Dull, aimless, incoherent narrative;  making the mistake of confusing \\"gotcha\\" ironies with good writing. Severely lacking in believable character motivations. If you are going to use a first-person narrator, don't (a) sideline her for much of the action, and (b) trash her character so the reader can't stand her by the end. I found the \\"mission\\" to kill Snow unforgivable. Katniss doing this on her own? OK. Katniss leading her squad to death over this? No way. This Katniss wouldn't have survived the first Games. Where are her instincts? Where is her strength of character that led her to the act of rebellion that started everything?<br /><br />I can understand that all the characters we're supposed to care about can't survive, but Collins was gratuitous IMO. Some were deliberately built up to add to the pathos. That's a cheap stunt.<br /><br />How she handled Gale versus Peeta was actually one of the better aspects of the book, as it was in character for both. But in general, Peeta's storyline was almost unbearably bad. Again squandering the work done in Book 1.<br /><br />The denouement brought me back to questioning the entire initial premise: Why would the Games be an effective deterrent to the Districts in the first place? If anything, they would sow the seeds of rebellion. You don't punish people proactively; you hold that punishment over their heads. Other thoughts that came to mind were: How are they even able to live in 12? It's destroyed; there are no farms, no supplies. The infrastructure of Panem is inruins. The population is decimated. Why would people be sent or allowed to go to far-flung areas where it's harder to sustain them? A powerful end wouldn't leave a reader thinking along these lines.<br /><br />Basically, in The Hunger Games I was never aware I was reading a YA book. I was very aware of it by Book 3, with the plot shortcuts, paper-thin characterization, and heavy-handed message. Young adults IMO deserve better.<br /><br />I can't even imagine wanting to see this movie.

My favorite feature is definitely the syncing ability that allows me to access my notes on my Kindle Fire, net book and iPhone. Aside from academic notes, I've found it particularly useful for storing interior decorating inspirations, recipes and clothing inspirations.
006107327X|5.0|This book shows a lot of the creative process during the making of Batman the Animated Series. Im a huge fan of this series and this book is just perfect. Is fun to see the first drawings of Harley Quinn (the design sucks a lot) and thanks that they changed it to the design that we all know and love.<br /><br />This book also have a huge page (like a poster) of the Title Card of each episode in the series, is wonderfull
0439023513|2.0|I realised about a third of the way into this book that I was totally bored by it, and felt absolutely nothing for anyone. But given that it was the final book in this trilogy, and a quick read, I pressed on & finished it. I actually didn't mind the ending. But I found many of the storylines throughout the book ridiculous & totally glossed over or summed up in one unfeeling sentence. A frustrating read.

I bought one for my daughter to play with and one for me to keep as a keepsake! So, YES she is that cheap (everywhere, evidently) NO she is not the comic-con doll (um, duh?) but she is a fab doll and price. Run out to your local Wal-Mart today and see if you can find her :)
B0043KK4N6|2.0|Burlesque:  I saw the movie; have watched it numerous times, and wanted to get the soundtrack.  Be aware that the soundtrack is not the same music as in the movie.  The arrangements are altered, and, for some reason, the tempo is slightly sped up, which is somewhat disconcerting.  There is an electronic/techno vibe that has been added in several of the songs that is not the feeling of the movie.  Wish they had just taken the actual movie soundtrack instead of tweaking it.  Will be giving it away.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I didn't expect much coming into this movie, but found myself laughing the entire way through. Being from the country, I could relate to a lot of these situations, and every character fit perfectly into their stereotypes, with plenty of pleasant twists.<br /><br />After I watched it twice on Prime I decided it was definitely worth owning so I could go back to my hometown and show the friends. They don't typically have patience to actually sit through a movie without getting distracted, but I thought this one might just do the trick, and sure enough, we were laughing through the entire thing. For being an apparently low-budget and relatively unheard of movie, this probably had some of the most clever writing I've seen in a modern comedy. Everything, literally everything, was some kind of joke. A lot of subtle humor that can slip by you as well, that I only caught the third time through watching it. Great show, five stars.<br /><br />As for the mature content, there is a fair amount of gore, a fair amount of misc. swearing and a liberal use of the \\"f\\" word (I haven't counted but I would say easily double digits for the F-bombs, maybe more than 20)... but aside from that and some brief and distant nudity it is relatively tame (a character wears somewhat revealing clothing as well). That being said, they could have taken a LOT more liberties and this ranks as one of the most tame R rated horror/comedies I've seen in a long time. Probably not suited for young audiences.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|Another American remake (by another Hollywood thief) that fails to live up to the original, [[ASIN:B00000JL42 Perfect Blue]].  So, two stars off for that.<br /><br />Still, as a standalone film, it was worth a watch.  It does convey the intense anxiety, stress, complete dysfunction of severe mental illness (in this case it looks like acute psychosis) very well, so I have to give it 3 stars for that.  And even though I came into this film with the intention of hating it, I have to admit that I didn't hate it at all.  It kept me interested and entertained, and that's what matters.<br /><br />But there still needs to be a penalty for stealing (technically he paid for it, but I still consider it artistic theft) someone else's work and then DENYING that you've done so.  A shame.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the third book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Released in 2010, it's a best seller, and the award winning author, Suzanne Collins, has received rave reviews for it and the entire series.<br /><br />Early on in Mockingjay, Katniss makes the comment, \\"We are still in the game.\\" Indeed she is. Throughout this book, she is alive, though you cannot always say, alive and well, very seldom can you add the well. Though she is no longer is a participant in an actual Hunger Games, her life remains on edge as the rebel resistance strengthens and grows, and as in the games, she and Peeta are faced with constantly determining what is real and not real. Not to give anything away, but in the end, they both do a very good job of this.<br /><br />The violence in this book is even more graphic as torture and death are even more detailed then in the other two books, though it's a progressive build up and does not surpass what is necessary for the story. The plotting is incredible, full of action, and includes fabulous twists, Suzanne Collins ¬¬uses skillful foreshadowing so you don't get too shocked.  In at least one place in the book, I gasped out loud and my heart rate increased. The ending is a great wrap up to the series and I found it very satisfying. The most wonderful thing about the ending was I really didn't know what it was going to be. Collins kept me on the edge right up to the end with that wonderful feeling of a wild roller coaster ride. Suzanne Collins is an incredible story teller and I have enjoyed this series so much. I recommend the entire series and if you have read one or two, you must read all three.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This band is still rocking hard. Brent's voice is awesome and you can feel the passion there. I love how with each outing Shinedown doesn't just copy itself. They make each album its own beast without losing their signature sound. Rock may not be as mainstream as R&B or hip hop, but I hold this genre to hold, for me, more meaning and diversity, and not trying to fit into what they think people will like in singing about money, sex and violence just to make money. Those kind of rock bands exist too but I steer clear of that trash. I'll take my Shinedown, Sevendust and Daughtry.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game,although you have to be kinda patient to really enjoy the game fully. The ads are kinda annoying, but the more you play, the number of ads become very minimal.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I went to John Carter because I wanted to see what Stanton would do with Burroughs' 100 year old story. After all, the guy did Finding Nemo and Walli. He knows how to tell a good story--and this is a fine retelling of the story. I actually went back a second time, which I don't ever do cuz I can't afford that, but after seeing the film I read a bunch of reviews. Had the critics seen a different movie than the one I saw? I don't understand their passionate hostility. I liked it even more the second time. I appreciated the humor more the second time, and the art direction and the special effects, etc., etc.<br /><br />As Peter Travers from Rolling Stone says, the \\"toxic buzz\\" out about this flick before it was even released was totally unjustified. Travers says it's like a story told around a campfire, without cynicism, and Taylor Kitsch does a darn good job as John Carter. It's a solid, intelligent, dare I say, layered performance. Travers is absolutely right on all counts.<br /><br />Go see it. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />(And I can't wait to see the special features on the Blu Ray!)

B0015DYIH2|5.0|Personally I loved this book.  Most people thought it was just about love and it is about love. But its so much more than that it about sacrifice, strength, believing yourself,and love.  Not just a teenage romance that make girls choose who Bella should be with by how much they take there shirt off or how sparkly they are. In my opinion this is a great book.
B0071MV540|3.0|Tower Heist has a great ensemble cast and for the most part it is a fun movie. The downside is that it doesn't quite make it into the league of above average heist films and is not a full-blown comedy either. This is a pity because the cast is awesome - there's Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Alan Alda, Matthew Broderick, Tea Leoni, Gabourey Sidibe, Casey Affleck, and more.<br /><br />The premise of the story is one that many can relate to - the employees at a posh apartment complex discover they've been duped by a rich businessman in a Ponzi scheme. Ben Affleck plays apartment complex manager, Josh Kovacs, who due to his implicit trust in said businessman, Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda pulling off a very credible Madoff-like role), gets Shaw to invest not only his pension, but those of all the employees at the complex, believing their portfolio would increase threefold. When Shaw is arrested for his Ponzi scheme, the lead FBI investigator (played by Leoni) fails to find any incriminating evidence. Meanwhile, Kovacs decides to rob Shaw, believing Shaw has hidden the stolen money somewhere in his penthouse. The rest of the story follows Kovacs and his accomplices as they try to plan a heist.<br /><br />There was much potential for this to be an above-average comedy-heist movie but it sort of flounders due to a lackluster script. The cast is a talented one but the actors could only work with what they are given, resulting in weak character development, and some lags in pacing. Overall, my husband and I were entertained - this makes a fun rental movie, but not a keeper.

0756405890|5.0|While it had a slow start, this was the best story I've read in a long time. It's not the normal \\"Good Guy vs Bad Guy\\" Sci-Fi/Fantasy novel. It's original & you have no idea what's going to happen next. I wasn't ready for it to end.
0374275637|2.0|This book I picked up at the Yale book store, when I took my daughter to a tournament. The title sounded interesting and it had glowing reviews on Amazon. With two daughters playing sports competitively I found some interesting sections, which I could apply to sport psychology. But as I kept reading the book seemed more and more repetitive with lots of discussion on probability. Despite having an engineering math background and doing day to day math with my 8th grader, my head started spinning and I was wondering if I was suppose to follow through with all the fancy probability equation the authors was discussing or just take his word for granted and move on. I tried to skip over the deep mathematical sections to avoid feeling like I was in some statistics class, and move on, but the repetition and the wow factor was being lost. I just can't push myself to read this further. It is simply tedious and boring!
B00756GKBA|1.0|OK, so I don't want to date myself too much.  But let's say I lived my teens and the 80's at the same time (Yes, I somehow survived being a teenager in the 80's.)<br />Being a teenager, my primary interests at the time were girls, music, girls, girls and girls.  Pretty much in that order.  And the girls I was interested in?  They were all listening, dressing and acting madonna.  In trying to figure out the girls, I (in my teenage wisdom) figured it would be a good thing to figure out this madonna thing, too.  So I listened.  And I became a huge fan.<br />One of the first madonna songs I ever heard was Borderline (on VINYL).  To this day, it is still EASILY in my top ten favorite songs of all time.  In that top ten list are other madonna tunes like Crazy For You and Dress You Up, just to name a couple.  I consider myself a madonna fan of the type that CRINGES when he sees her name MISspelled as \\"Madonna\\" (ouch!)  If you really think it's spelled \\"Madonna\\", you'd better stop reading right HERE.  You and I are not going to see eye to eye on the spelling OR this review.<br />madonna was true music royalty, pumping out radio-friendly electro-pop songs that made you want to DANCE!  She was the first artist I knew of that never produced a dud.  I could literally listen to a whole madonna album from first track to last...and set the record player on auto-repeat indefinitely.<br />Then her fourth album was released.  Yes, I own it.  Yes, I listened to it.  I wanted to like it, I really did.  But madonna just wasn't there anymore.  She'd started 'reinventing' herself, turning into something that just wasn't worth listening to anymore.  After all, if you are a madonna fan you don't want to have to WORK to enjoy your music...<br />By the time the 5th album was released, I was thoroughly convinced that madonna just didn't care about her core fans anymore.  I moved on to other artists.  madonna just wasn't even on my personal radar anymore.<br />Then many years later, something fantastic happened.  madonna debuted a VERY catchy new single at the superbowl halftime show.  And while she was definitely upstaged by M.I.A., madonna herself got my attention in a huge way.  Give Me All Your Luvin' is the single I wished was on the fourth album.  madonna it seemed was BACK with another feel-good dance song that made me ummmmmmm...want to DANCE!!!<br />Because of that showing at the superbowl, I was very excited to hear the new album MDNA.  To me, the Luvin' single, as well as the album title (MDNA) seemed to suggest (SCREAM, actually) that madonna was going back to her roots.  And that would have been a GOOD THING.<br />Sadly, it was just a tease.  A true madonna album is something that you love the first time you hear it.  It's not something that has to grow on you.  You hear the intro high chimes and thumping drum beats of a song like Think Of Me and you are HOOKED already.  madonna hasn't even started to sing yet, but you already know you're going to love it.  Where are songs like that today?  You can certainly buy them on Amazon, or download them from itunes...but they were all produced about a quarter of a century ago.  If you are looking for such tunes on MDNA (where they should be), your quest will be futile.<br />I've forced myself to listen to MDNA a few times.  I was hoping it would grow on me.  Of course, the fact that I was HOPING it would grow on me should have clued me in that I was wasting my time.  This is not madonna.  MDNA is in a word, depressing.<br />There are sooooooo many reasons I could call this album depressing.  The sad lyrics, the lack of any beat worth listening to (other than Luvin'), the realization that such crap reflects the true feelings of an artist who used to be so full of life and joyful energy...<br />MDNA isn't the kind of album that makes you want to dance, it is the kind of album that makes you want to slit your wrists.  OK, maybe that's a little harsh.<br />But damn I'm p___ed off.  How DARE she tease hertrue fans with a brilliant tune like Give Me All Your Luvin'... and then bury it among dozens of garbage tracks that are (at best) depressing?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow these books are steamy! The interesting thing is that although the content is, shall we say, shocking adult material, they are witty and well written.  Funny little quirky things like SHOUTY CAPITALS really give these books the extra material needed to propel them to the best seller list. I found them highly entertaining...a refreshing change from all of the deep sad historical fiction that I have been reading.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I'll leave the review of the content and the debate of it to others.  Instead I'll comment specifically on the blu-ray package.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.  Excellent video quality.  Extremely clean as you would expect given it was originally filmed and aired in HD.<br />2.  Same goes for sound quality.<br />3.  No Mandatory previews or extras that you have to sit through or fast forward through.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  Silly menu scheme.  Rather than show what is specifically on each disk it does a \\"continuous menu\\" where if you select a feature it tells you \\"please insert disk 5\\".  I guess some people like it but I prefer to have it bundled with the extras on a single \\"bonus disk\\" unless they are episode specific.<br />2.  Extra features are a bit lacking.  I would have liked to see a few more.  Cast interviews were pretty good.<br />3.  They chose not to implement bookmark or resume.  I've seen lots of discussion on why some Blu-rays support resume and some don't.  To be honest I'm not sure what the reason is.  I do know on some Blu-ray disks resume works, on others it doesn't.  For example Smallville Season 10 Blu-Ray supported resume on the same player that Game of Thrones does not.<br />4.  Not sure they really needed as many disks as they had.  Disk 3 for example has a single episode on it. Even with the extra feature on that disk One would think that they could get another episode on there.<br /><br />Overall a decent blu-ray box set.  If you enjoyed Game of Thrones it's worth picking up.  If you didn't then there is nothing compelling enough in this box set to change your mind.<br /><br />Personally I loved the show and thought it was an excellent adaptation of the novel.  However, definitely not for everyone.

B0076XIS4O|4.0|To appreciate Claire, you need to check out a few Grimes music videos and live clips. There are a lot of female vocalists that are tough to understand without seeing the person; Bjork, Coco Rosie, and Laurie Anderson can all sound pretty weird the first time you hear them, before you get a feel for the person and what they are like.<br /><br />I know that Ladytron is a respected group, for the most part, but I think Grimes really improves on their whole formula of beats and wispy female vocals. Ladytron's lyrics don't age well, but Claire avoids this problem because her lyrics are harder to make out. Also, her beats are a lot more fun than Ladytron. I am a huge fan of Crystal Castles, but no one seems willing to admit that CC mostly use drum patterns from house music. This is where Claire shines the most, because none of her beats are loyal to any specific genre, except the generic label of \\"dance music.\\"<br /><br />I do enjoy this album, as an extension of this fascinating person, but I have to admit that it feels like something is missing. I know she had done many collaborations, but I would like to hear another voice in this album just to change things up, and I would be interested to hear Claire break up her beats once in a while for some moody break-down kind of moments.<br /><br />Before you mark my review as unhelpful, please note that I give this a good score, but mainly it seems like a peek at this artist's future potential, as she seems to improve with each release. I'm anxious to see what she does next.

B00000IQV7|1.0|This movie is just plain horrible. It makes Hunter Adams out to be a jackass who steals from hospitals, and operates without a license. This movie is more like Amadeus, its based on a real person, but its mostly fiction...that is if Amadeus was a terrible movie. For example, the movie makes a point that Hunter never studied and just breezed by, when in all reality he studied hard in medical school. Also, the girl in the movie, the love interest NEVER EXISTED. She is the female replacement for a dear friend of Hunter Adams who was murdered while they were attending medical school. Back to the movie making him look like a complete jackass, his treatments are not like that. In reality, they are personalized and unique to each patient, and NOT ACTING LIKE A JACKASS! Also, Hunter never stole from a hospital to stock his free clinic, also he never, ever, ever, ever, ever operated his clinic without a medical license.<br /><br />Not to mention Hunter Adams had denounced this film numerous times and he himself hates it. People have claimed that he never cashed the check he got from this movie.<br /><br />In other words, this movie needs to be altered where it does not say \\"Based on a true story\\". If it was, then Titanic can have the same titling.<br /><br />Pick another movie instead, and leave this one to be forgotten.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Woody Allen's latest, Midnight in Paris, is in the vein of nostalgia we have had from him since Manhattan, combined with his framing of a picturesque city:there it was rhapsodic,here it is small-scale.Owen Wilson plays Gil,an unemployed Hollywood screenwriter working on his first novel,holidaying with his fiancée Inez(McAdams)prior to their wedding.Allen's Paris is seductively lit,but doesn't feel modern or real and largely unpeopled. Allen uses his old trick of wit and whimsy(a la Purple Rose) to effect time travel by midnight Peugot cab to Paris in the 20s to meet Hemingway,the Fitzgeralds,Cole Porter,Dali,Picasso,Bunuel,Stein, the Lost Generation. He is bored with his fiancée who belittles him in front of a male friend Paul(Sheen),who he lets go out with while Gil wanders the streets,jumping time,getting a review of his latest novel from Stein and Hemingway, while falling in love with Adriana(Cotillard),Picasso's mistress.The here and now is just another fantasy so there is no farewell to nostalgia.The Belle Epoque they also visit,meeting Degas and Lautec, are surprised they think it so great.Contentment is always backward-looking,Gil must set aside fantasy and make do with the here and now.<br /><br />Inez's mother and father,Tea Party types,have their doubts about Gil,and have him followed by a private detective,who ends up as the object of the best joke in the film.Owen Wilson is charming and carries off the name-dropping Allen lines with comic verve,Hemingway(Stoll) is superbly gruff,Dali(Brody)a wizard of crazy wit. There are beautiful cameos from Cotillard and Lea Sedoux.There are some good one-liners as Gil negotiates seamlessly between the past and the present and the music,Bechet,Porter,gives the uncanny power of nostalgia a boost.While being without the energy of Vicky Christina Barcelona,it's a dreamy and jazzy bauble of vintage Allen and better.I think Allen has become a byword for rosy nostalgia and present fantasy.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a spoiler-free review.<br /><br />I found the Mockingjay, like Catching Fire and The Hunger Games, to be intense and gripping. What I wasn't prepared for was the sheer amount of pain I experienced on behalf of the characters. This is not a drawback. Collins further probes the depths of cruelty humans can plunge to, and the results are realistic and haunting.<br /><br />Also, and this is not unique to The Hunger Games trilogy, I would like it if epilogues were longer. I know they're not as gripping as a pulsing narrative, but if we've made it through several books with a character, we're going to read as much as we can about how they've fared. I want any joy to be recounted as intricately as the pain, so we have time to heal with the characters we've grown to love. We experience so much pain on behalf of Katniss and her family and friends; it would relieve some of the tension to experience more of her healing process.<br /><br />That being said, The Mockingjay is a masterfully well-written, ethically complex novel that will expose teens and adults alike to deep, complex questions and reveal their own darkness. This is a novel that asks excruciating questions about our culture and ourselves, and we shouldn't walk away from that examination.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|999 is one of the best DS games I've ever played.  Here's why:<br /><br />1. It flawlessly combines the idea of a visual novel with good gameplay.<br />2. The variety of puzzles featured throughout provide a good challenge, and if you truly are stuck, the game will provide a hint for you.<br />3. The characterization is great.  Without looking at the name, you should be able to tell who's talking just from a sentence or two.<br />4. There are multiple endings, and they each provide further insight into what's going on.<br />5. When you want to get another ending, you'll inevitably run into text you've read before.  You have the option of reading it again or basically putting it on fast forward, which is really nice for replaying.<br />6. The music is fitting.  The game even knows when it's best to not play any music at all.<br />7. The story is very deep.  It's almost like a puzzle, with each ending giving you another piece to put together.<br />8. Localization, or lack thereof.  If you're the type of person who gets annoyed by Japanese games being rewritten for Western audiences, you'll be happy to note that the only alterations they made to the script in this game (besides translating) were to make certain puns work.<br />9. Speaking of puns, despite the fact that this game is serious for the most part, it is hilarious when it wants to be.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is exactly what I expected to be, after reading some of the other reviews I'm wondering what some ppl thought solitaire was. I do have to click an &quot;X&quot; when first starting a game on my kindle,  but I'be never had to watch videos for anything and the ads only come up with a new game. All in all it was what I wanted so I give it 5 stars.
1594202842|5.0|I don't understand why this book has so many bad reviews. I found this book to be mind blowing. I am Mexican and I grew up in a Mexican neighborhood. We call Asians \\"chinitos,\\" no matter is Japanese, Chinese, etc. A very ignorant thing to do. This book really opens your eyes on how other cultures parent. After reading the book, I was left wondering how other cultures parent their children.<br /><br />Some people might view the Tiger parent in a negative way, but look at Amy Chua's kids. They are AMAZING! Beyond incredible for their age.<br /><br />If you are going to judge Mrs. Chua, take a look at your kids and her kids. Now compare them. Your kids do not come close to Mrs. Chua's kids.<br /><br />One last note, after finishing the book, I was inspired. I felt that I could do so much more if I worked even harder. :D<br /><br />I love this book!

B007O6R1MI|4.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers that this was the best Supernatural episode in a while. This season just doesn't seem to be coming together, even with the shock of Bobby's death. However, the actor who plays Lucifer has always been delightfully creepy and it is a pleasure to see him. As other noted, Cas is back, though ignorant of who and what he is. All in all a good episode.<br /><br />Now for the season overall: I have been a Supernatural fan for a long time and I would hate to see the boys go but feel that the writers have been struggling to find their way ever since the apocalypse that wasn't. This isn't to say there haven't been good episodes and seasons, there have been, but the show never entirely recovered from that mis-step. This season has no arc to tie to together and the stand-alones have either been done or you wish they hadn't bothered. This episode was good because of the acting and because the plot was connected to several previous plots and to characters the audience loves to watch.

B005XI94HY|5.0|Let me just say Ceremonials is even better than Lungs. Lungs was great; Ceremonials is beyond great. To my mind, this is a near classic. Florence is a female Bruce Springsteen for the new age. There are so many great songs on this album. I have listened to the whole thing now maybe 20 times... it keeps getting better with each listen. Most albums, by the time you heard them three times, you're getting tired. It's not just the vocals and the music. The Lyrics are brilliant. Get this today: you won't regret it.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I saw this movie last night and must admit I had some very strong, mixed emotions about it, especially since I lived in Hawaii for a long period of time.  I thought it focused more on Haoles (Caucasians) then on the mixed races<br />that live throughout the Islands.  I also thought the interiors of the homes that were photographed were a little off--especially with their very commercial artwork.  I found it particularly disturbing that the younger people portrayed (some of which were attending Punahou)  a very elite private school on Oahu, were depicted as being foul-mouthed and dim-witted.  I read some of the other reviews and was surprised that no one commented on this issue.<br /><br />Not really sure how local people in the islands would respond to this movie.  I found it interesting that none of the other actors were particularly attractive people which I thought was a little odd as there are many very good looking people of all nationalities living in the Islands.  The love interest of Elizabeth hardly looked the part...and it seemed to me that having very ordinary looking people in the movie was quite intentional role casting on the director's part.<br /><br />Nevertheless, after watching it again the following morning I found that I had a much higher opinion of the movie and found it much more enjoyable.  George Clooney did a stupendous job portraying the character of Matt which was very believable and at the same time endearing to watch.  You could almost feel his pain and confusion and his determination to make everything better if he could just have a second chance with his hopes for Elizabeth recovering from her serious head injury.<br /><br />Although George masterfully portrayed \\"just an ordinary guy\\" his performance was far from ordinary--it was outstanding.  This movie definitely grows on you as it is not a typical \\"eternal sunshine\\" Hawaiian paradise\\" movie production.  Instead much of the movie was filmed during cloudy, overcast days which helped to set the mood for the reality that the sun does not perpetually shine in paradise.<br /><br />The first time I saw the movie I could not even imagine that Clooney received a nomination for Best Actor and after watching it a second time I could not believe that he did not win it.

1612680011|4.0|First of all this book is an easy read that opens your eyes and makes you think differently about wealth and how to look at at the rich/poor situation. It is not designed to give you a step-by-step guide to getting rich...the other books by Robert and his advisors do that better.<br /><br />He is very straight forward as to why the rich are rich and the poor and middle class don't get ahead. In many cases he is right on..although I do feel that sometimes he does it in a heavy-handed way that almost borders on insulting. However, to make the point I guess it works.<br /><br />The only other thing is that he repeats himself alot. This is good because it reinforces his points, however I also got the feeling he was using this as a way to fill up the book.<br /><br />The one thing I took away from this book that really changed how I look at things is that the poor don't own Assets, the middle class buys liabilities and thinks they are assets and the rich buy true assets. Seems simple enough but very profound when put in context with the rest of the book.<br /><br />I am now reading some of his advisor's books on investing in real estate. Some very good ideas in those books, but they also tend to repeat themselves alot and seem to stop short of actually telling you exactly how to go about investing. Alot of roundabout generalities used, but otherwise good info.
B0038KHTGC|4.0|The Avantasia \\"Wicked Trilogy\\" is made up of 3 solid albums - while they don't overflow with creativity, they present a very enjoyable set of songs each time. The albums all follow a familiar formula - but this is what the so-called \\"great composers\\" were doing hundreds of years before this in composing their own symphonies, trilogies or what have you. So you can't fault Tobias for following in the footsteps of his fellow countrymen; they were the rockstars of their time just as Tobias is a rockstar in our time. His songwriting has evolved from the first incarnation of Avantasia and the first decade or so of Edguy's existence, when both were devoted followers of the more conventional power metal approach. But as the years have gone by, Tobias has taken Edguy in a more straight-ahead rocking direction, while also keeping some of those power metal conventions intact. That change was also applied when Avantasia returned with their \\"Lost In Space\\" EP, and it continues on Wicked Symphony.<br /><br />Many of the songwriting elements that brought together the first part are back: you have epics, straight-up heavy songs, melodic hard rock, plus some traditional power metal fare. Naturally, a lot of these songs could fit right in on an Edguy release - however, the use of the additional vocalists adds some depth (only \\"The Edge\\" makes no use of them). Tobias, Michael Kiske, Bob Catley and Jorn Lande are joined by new vocalists - while Rusell Allen's strong vocals don't appear to be in mind when writing the songs he appears on, the vocal styles of the other new guests were definitely taken into account when writing them. Ripper Owens appears on \\"Scales Of Justice,\\" which is arguably the heaviest track on the album and suits his somewhat furious vocal delivery. Klaus Meine's voice suits the melodic hard rock of \\"Dying For An Angel\\" quite well. The heavy, almost alternative-metal sounding grooves on \\"Black Wings\\" suit the somewhat aggressive nature of Ralf Zdiarstek's rather unusual voice. Andre Matos has a voice that compliments that of Tobias almost perfectly for the very Edguy-esque \\"Blizzards On A Broken Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The additional highlights of the album include the title track (an epic battle between vocalists in Allen, Lande and Sammet), \\"Runaway Train,\\" \\"Crestfallen\\" (another pseudo alt-metal groove), and \\"States Of Matter.\\" The rest of the tracks are solid even if not highlights, and at the very least it sounds like they are being played effortlessly. This is why I especially like this album - it may follow a formula, but Tobias sure as hell knows what he is doing when he writes this music.sual voice.

0545265355|5.0|Quite honestly one of the most powerful trilogies I have read in my life. I don't know why these are considered young adult books. They're certainly able to be read by them, but, as a 21-year-old, even I was really struck by the violence in this novel.<br />Don't get pulled in about the commercialism and the media hype about The Hunger Games. Or, do. It can perhaps work like that for the first book at least. But once you realize the horror of this dystopia---killing children to quell rebellion---which is basically given to you in the first book, then the story becomes about so much more than just good versus evil and simple tales of bombs and resistance.<br /><br />*************Spoilers ahead about the rest of the trilogy******************<br /> I was expected the typical ending to the trilogy: a violent revenge on the capitol. But what I wasn't expecting was Suzanne Collins showing us exactly how the supposed 'good side'/rebels have, because of their own hatred towards the capital (which is certainly not their fault) have become the very thing they aimed to destroy This book isn't about one thing. It's not just about dystopian violence and the shallowness of televising things and the ridicuous indulgence of some while others starve and go without. That in and of itself could be a social tract. But as the trilogy proceeds, it becomes about love too. Not sappy, traditional romantic love. Love based on partnership, need. True love ,it seems, has almost nothing to do with kissing. Katniss and Peeta become connected to each other in such a way  that it's almost inexplicable. They take care of each other. They survive together. They always want what is best for the other. And neither fears death. Both are strong and both love. That's the kind of love the trilogy becomes about. Loyalty and love, purely.<br />But then, ultimately, as Mockingjay finishes, the trilogy is about more than that too. In the acknowledgements, Suzanne Collins thanked her father for giving her ideas of \\"war and peace\\". That is essentially what this trilogy is about. Horrific violence, even hatred, the struggle to survive against it, the rightful rebellion to overthrow it, BUT also the way in which the victims or the side seeking to take over can be or is just as sick as the former evil rulers. In the end, these books aren't about getting revenge and blowing things up. They're about *not* doing those things. Finding your humanity in the midst of the desire to become vengeful, and cruel, a monster that you once sought to destroy.<br /><br />I won't say this book is essentially pacifist, but it's underlying message is less about actual war and peace and violence and more about finding, claiming, and retaining our humanity at all costs. The ability to love, to be kind and to appreciate kindness, and everything good in the world. (It's sort of similar to what happened at the end of the seventh Harry Potter, but way more powerful/potent).<br /><br />If we are going to play a game, Collins writes, play one of remembering each joyous thing, of giving yourself and others happiness. THis doesn't mean not fighting when you're attacked. But Katniss isn't just a warrior. She's everyone. She has a moral center and we see her through the trilogy navigating it and struggling with it and what it means.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Collins for a spectacular and moving trilogy. I am not exaggerating when I say that this trilogy could almost be a social tract. It speaks of oppression, violence. (Marx might actually have something to say about that). I am almost reminded of Hannah Arendt and scholars on war and violence. Here, these ideas (slightly different) are made personal. It's as we see people dying and this warrior-girl breaking apart as people around her die, she lets herself be vulnerable again. That doesn't make her any less strong. It, perhaps, makes her more strong. She stops the cycle of revenge and bloodlust and she chooses peace.<br /><br />That's one of the most important messages, so carefully woven, so perfectly planned, so potent, that I've ever received from a book.<br /><br />A superb, at times disturing, but enirely necessary series. Thank you, Suzanne Collins.<br />If only the world could see this as it is.<br /><br />Choose peace. (This is not necessarily the same thing as being a pacifist. It's if violence is necessary, make sure it ends when it's over. But choose peace and justice, certainly. But remember that we are all human beings. The book strips down all the characters, shows us that behind the pretence and the acts and the supposed demeanor, we are all just human beings who love, feel, hurt, can hate. And I think the author is urging us not to forget the parts of us that love, feel, and hurt. It's about not letting the cycle of power and violence and hatred continue). It's about keeping your humanity.

B0014DCT06|4.0|This evening's entertainment was a concert DVD, not a movie. Nice break. It was the \\"Futuresex / Loveshow - Live From Madison Square Garden DVD. The concert was amazing. MSG is a huge venue and the elaborate stage was centrally located. Man, I can't even estimate the size of the audience but there were an ocean of people out there. The concert was very well done, but I have mixed feelings about it..<br /><br />First of all, the filming was excellent. Superb! It gave a real nice feeling for the concert, the performers and the audience. Well done!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, and don't take that as a negative statement as I've never seen or heard him before. I've heard of him, but this was my first experience with his music and stage presence. He's talented, without question. He sings and dances and plays the piano, portable keyboards and guitar. Plus he's a good showman and interacts well with the audience. In short, the man puts on a good show and is somewhat reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Did I enjoy his performance? Yes. Also, the supporting cast of the band, singers and dancers were excellent. No expense was spared.<br /><br />I have a problem with the sound on this DVD. It's awful! Okay, I'm a bit of an audiophile and I like clear, clean, pristine sound. I've got a reasonably good stereo and I can get excellent sound off of most LPs or CDs. No problem. The sound on this DVD is so muddled that I can't understand the lyrics or the voices when the music isn't playing. I've had this same problem with other live recorded concerts and I've had the same problem in going to some concerts. It's the room acoustics. If I had to listen to this concert without the video on a CD, I couldn't do it. No way. I just couldn't stand it. With the accompanying video, which is quite good, I can do it but it induces aural fatigue. That's too bad. It's an excellent concert DVD flawed by the sound.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B000JY19ZC|5.0|Here's another of my CD reviews from the archives. This one is the \\"Traveling Wilburys\\" and these days they add Volume1 to the title. I bought it at Tower Records (remember them?) when it first came out in 1988. A vintage album. No remastering or anything like that. This is the real deal!<br /><br />Well, talk about a super-group! It's the Wilbury clan, all five of them. And it's brought to you by the Wilbury Record Company, a subdivision of the Trans-Wilbury Corporation of Bulgaria. Okay, I'm getting this off the information folder included with the CD. What we have here is five super-star guitarists and singer-songwriters. All have gilt-edged credentials. None have any need for a hit record, money or worldly things of that sort. It's just a group of really good musicians getting together for a fun session of turning out an album. Tongues are firmly in cheeks. Okay, what do you think the music is like? Surprise, t's fun! It's light and uplifting and just comes across as if everyone is having a great time. What would you expect? There's no other reason for getting together. The resulting music is great. It has a very country feel, or maybe you might say country-rock feel. Well, after all, it's five guys on guitars and you could add just a little backgroundish drums, percussion, tom-toms and saxophones, but never let them become intrusive. Blend the vocals of all five guys. I guess that was the most difficult part. One of the guys doesn't seem to blend too well and sounds a lot like Roy Orbison. Oh, well. What are you going to do?<br /><br />What else can I say? The recording is 24 years old and has been reviewed and praised by everyone and his uncle. Do you want some really pleasant music? Do you want to enjoy yourself. Here's the ticket.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007FC3AAI|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />If you're developing cold feet at the prospect of tying the knot - especially if you happen to be human and your intended a vampire - you may want to avoid watching \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,\\" written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Bill Condon.  And if you are contemplating having a baby with a vampire, then you REALLY don't want to catch this fourth film based on the series of phenomenally successful novels by Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her dreamy vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get hitched, but happiness is fleeting for the newlyweds as the still-human Bella finds herself coping with the most disturbing and problematic movie pregnancy since \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" (or \\"Alien,\\" if you want to count that as a pregnancy).<br /><br />In purely narrative terms, this is a fairly static entry in the series, as Bella wastes away to skeletal status through the ordeal, and everyone sits around discussing the moral implications of having an unprecedented cross-species child, especially when the birth experience itself will likely spell death for the mother.  There's a halfhearted attempt at revving up the action when the werewolves threaten to intervene by killing Bella, but the star-crossed and loyalty-divided Jacob (Taylor Lautner) defuses the situation in quick order (it also leads to a ludicrous voiceover conversation among the wolves that provides some unintentional laughs for the audience).<br /><br />Still, Stewart gets to do more intense acting than she has thus far in the series, and Bella's transformation plus the addition of the child offer new story possibilities for \\"Breaking Dawn - Part 2,\\" due for release in November 2012.

0307956350|1.0|What an awful piece of clumsy dreck.  A fine example of the great NYC publishing marketing machine in motion. Congrats for that, but seriously? Sure, I was curious, having read all the blurbs. Wish I hadn't wasted my time. Expository and boring, with the last 50 pages still a hot mess. Blargh.

1577314808|5.0|There are those who point out - and correctly so - that what Tolle presents in this work is not original thought. To the best of my knowledge, he doesn't claim that the ideas presented in the book ARE original...in fact, throughout the book he references many of the world's religions. Tolle states in the Introduction that what he writes about is the essential truth that is found in all of the major religions, but which is too often obscured by being \\"overlaid with extraneous matter\\". I have to agree. If one were to read all of the many philosophies cited, I can't imagine the combined effect would provide clarity and overarching understanding for the reader. I have studied many of them myself, and finding a clear unifying thread is not a simple task.<br /><br />This is the brilliance of what Tolle has done; he's distilled many of these philosophies down to a core essence, and then states this information clearly and succinctly, without the veiled allusions or allegories that you find in many texts. In my case, I agree with another reviewer that pointed out that reading the Tao te Ching after reading TPoN provides a great deal more understanding and insight than previous readings.<br /><br />As the author points out early on, this is not a book you can grasp with your ego-driven, analytical mind; it is more along the lines of something you intuit as being true, and need to remain open to as you read. The good news is, Tolle doesn't ask us to believe anything; you can experience the truth of what he writes about if you simply put into practice what he writes about. I have found it to be very beneficial for my mental health and overall sense of well being in a short period of time, and I look forward to greater rewards with continued diligence and effort on my part. I have purchased several copies to give to friends and family, and I can't provide any higher rating than that.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Plenty of different Bible editions to choose from, same for different languages. Easy to use and navigate to wherever you want to go in the Bible. Text to speech for selected Bible versions. Tools for note taking and sharing on Facebook and twitter. Over all I am well pleased with this app.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay picks up without any break in the action. For the most part, it is a good ending to the trilogy. There are more freaky death machines/traps and many character deaths. One thing I did not like about the book was the destruction of so many characters. I would have preferred more attention to the relationships between Katniss and Gale and Peeta. The resolution of this \\"love triangle\\" is sort of an afterthought.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This cover is smart and classy, and should appeal to a wide range of people.  The style is also supported by durability and functionality.  I could have wished for a bit more versatility, nontheless this cover is of excellent value.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the app on my kindle and its very easy to go back and forth from books, study guides, &amp; the Bible. I'm going to start using this in church instead of my paper Bible :)
B001RIY4WE|3.0|This review is strictly for the SkyNet edition. The movie is awesome (and transferred to blu-ray reasonably well), but they have overdone the menu on this particular version so much that it takes forever to load and sometimes even crashes on a fully updated PS3. I could understand a cheap blu-ray player having problems with this, but this is the first blu-ray to actually freeze up the PS3. I'm pretty sure the PS3 is not on it's way out as all other discs I have played recently work fine. Cool idea, but I think the it would have been a better disc if they had kept the menu running a little more efficiently instead of trying to wow us with effects that slow down even a high end player.

1400079144|1.0|The seller said the item was in very good condition; however in reality the cover is bent and full of cracks. The cover of pages are also curled. I do not recommend doing business with this seller.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|As is generally true of all the blue ray replacements for my old dvds which I have thus far seen the extra sharpness makes the purchase most desirable .I love this particular Harry Potter story almost as much as the great first of the series . Although if you  find a film tiresome ,  such As The Fountain , extra visual sharpness cannot improve a turgid dud . Read the reviews by the pros .
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I received this Collectors Edition within the time limits specified & in excellent condition. This DVD shows ocean battles extremely well & gives one an insight of how sea battles were fought, the characters were well cast, the concern that Captain Aubrey had for his crew is special & the respect for Officers that was required of the crew is very interesting. Overall it is a touching & amazing movie that shows ethics, loyalty, compassion, duty, & respect that is lacking in today's society. The special features on the 2nd DVD are interesting & amazing. I watch it over & over.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am a huge Microsoft Office Fan! I have used all of Microsoft's software since Windows 3.1. It just keeps getting better, everytime. This app is the mobile version of the original Microsoft Office 2010. I was already familiar with the PC version as I use it in my school life as a studying Legal Assistant. This mobile app will allow me to keep better track of all my documents. Just one more thing to aid me in keeping organized! Thanks to Microsoft for developing it and Amazon for offering it! Both of you rock outloud! :-)
0545265355|5.0|I only just heard about these books a few months ago. I was interested, but never actually bought them. Then I heard the first movie was on its way to the big screen and I knew I had to read at LEAST the first book before the movie came out. I read the first book within the first 2 days of receiving it in the mail. I then proceeded to start the second book because the first was so amazing and left me hanging on the edge of my seat! I've since watched the movie (AWESOME!), and am about to start the 3rd in the trilogy.
0439023521|3.0|I had considered this book in the past and rejected it, but when all the hullabaloo came out about the movie I figured I'd go ahead and read it. This book will never be confused with great literature, but then I don't believe that is it's intent. I enjoyed reading it, but did feel it lacked substance. It was, simply put, just entertainment, no underlying \\"meaning\\" to it. When I think about the book after having read it, it's characters were underdeveloped and not really believable. The premise of the book, a future world where children are chosen to fight to the death, is unbelievable if you really think about it.<br />However, the bottom line is that I read it quickly and was entertained. I may get the sequels, but I'm in no rush for them.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I completely agree with the review my crazy Dutch friend, Marlene, wrote. So much time was spent on discussing life after the 74th Hunger Games, and not enough was spent on the 75th. Everyone pretty much could guess that Katniss had to return to the arena in some shape or form. It just took over half the book to get to that point. My other friend, Roberto, did warn me that this was the worst of the trilogy, so maybe Mockingjay will be able to attain more stars from me.<br /><br />I found it difficult not I think about how they would portray this one in a movie. Not that I've seen The Hunger Games, but from all of the money it's made it's not far-fetched to think this one will end up in Warner Brothers land. (I actually have no idea which production company delivered The Hunger Games but I don't think it matters when making this point.)<br /><br />I wonder what the third book will bring? Complete closure? More wardrobe changes for Katniss? More marriage proposals with an immaculate conception baby? Maybe I'm being too tough on this middle-child book. I'm sure it was a captivating read for YA folks but I fear it's moved just a touch too far into sci-fi land for me to thoroughly enjoy it.
B006M4RN3U|1.0|The general interest in Fun. predates this band with Nate Ruess' prior project The Format. With compelling melodies and harmonies there is no doubting the \\"hookability\\" of Some Nights. Unfortunately, the album does not come with an Explicit Lyric warning with the \\"f bomb\\" dropped 3 times and also some other choice words. Despite the wonderful musical content the listening experience was ruined and returned for a refund. Really Fun.? Until a clean edition is delivered this disc is a total miss.
B000N5F6OW|2.0|[[ASIN:B000N5F6OW Hatari!]]  Much to my dismay, I was unable to watch this movie on my computer.  I don't know if it was the feed or what.  It skipped and stopped repeatedly.  The voice was not in sync.  Hopefully I can figure out the problem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is AWESOME! I recommend this book to 11 and over because of the violence that takes place. It has violence,courage, hunting and yes kissing. This story tells what it is like to see your loved ones dye right in frount of you.join Katniss goes on a incredible journey when her sister is chosen and she takes her place. Read this book and go to the hunger games with Katniss.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Jusr watched this today, and I was far beyond 'pleasantly surprised'.  This movie has jumped to my short list of 'must watch' movies.  Owen Wilson delivers the nuanced performance of his career, while the premise and execution on the story is pure perfection.  The camera work, set design, and wardrobes are all stunning, for the most complete film I've seen in years!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I use for hours and when I am feeling down it lifts my spirits. It is an awesome app. I highly recommend it.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Clash of the Titans was an okay remake that could have been great, but the trailers for Wrath of the Titans looked to be a huge improvement and in some cases it was.<br /><br />From the Kraken to Kronos. Hades decides to join side Kronos to destroy the world and thus securing his immortality, but first he needs all the power Zeus contains to restore his daddy to his past glory. Perseus catches word of this and is on a mission to save his father, Zeus, and fights all kinds of creatures along the way.<br /><br />The CGI is excellent this time around and there are far fewer corny moments. Even the acting seemed less forced, though still pretty average. Seeing this in IMAX 3-D was worth the extra money. It was fully shot in this format so the images were crystal clear and it made you feel you were actually in the movie, along with the usual random objects being shot towards your face.<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans is pure mindless action with little need for dialogue or a well thought out story, but it is a fun movie to watch. Heck, I wouldn't mind seeing a third film in the series.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B002GJT4YQ|1.0|Before buying any extended edition, collector's editions, etc. HP fans should check out the Blu-Ray region free set on Amazon U.K. that has all 8 Movies plus the same on disk materials as what is offered in the Ultimate Editions (no collectible cards, booklets though). Why spend $30 on this set, when for about $20 more you can get the entire collection of movies, extra footage, interviews, etc. You can search the U.K. Amazon site for these keywords and read the reviews. Amazon does not allow posting external links to Amazon sites.<br /><br />Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free]<br /><br />Depending on what you are looking for, it may be well worth your time.

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|I bought this after seeing it at the theaters, but want people about buying any UltraViolet products.  This is no way provides a digital copy that can be used offline.  Let alone, you have to register with all of these different companies keep track of your sign-in and password just to watch something that you have already paid for.  Buying a digital copy with a blu-ray/DVD should be buying a disc that you can insert and upload to your device to watch later when not connected.  Therefore, BOYCOTT ALL ULTRAVIOLET PRODUCTS.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is a pretty addicting game.  I just got it today and love it.  The only thing I would change though is the controls it seems a little weird with the controls but other than that it is a great game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Space, aliens, war, more intelligent beings.  This book brings it all, including a surprise twist at the end pitting the fundamental disconnect between the need for abject savagery and the empathetic personality that would not allow such savagery to happen for real.<br /><br />Children utilized as pawns by an adult civilization that is rocked by a culture of fear.  Society is an even more tricky position when and if that entity that is feared is revoked.<br /><br />An absolute joy to read, despite some of its despondent overtones on the hopelesness of humanity.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome story! After the first chapter I was compelled to keep on reading until the very end, of the 3rd book! I couldn't read fast enough, I read all 3 books (The Hunger Games Trilogy)within 3 days.
B006QVRVJK|4.0|I thought the movie was fun and clever, and yes, so typical of parents.  Jodie Foster's character just cannot let go of the fact her baby has been brutalized and continually jabs at the other couple.  Kate Winslet's character just wants to do the right thing, and the guys are only there because their wives insisted on it.  From there, it's an emotional roller coaster ranging from \\"us against them,\\" to women against men and then finally, every man and woman for themself.  The ending scene in the park is great!

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|All science fiction futuristic societies are written to have a message about the current day. This is normally contained within the text, or a line someone speaks. The movie starts giving us some background for the games, but we don't know why there was a rebellion in the first place, something that is in the book. The rebellion resulted in a lottery where teens from the various districts must now compete in a survivor battle to the death, all for the entertainment of the audience. Early in the film we hear, &#34;If no one watches, we won't have a game.&#34; In other words if we stop watching reality TV shows, they will be taken off the air...not exactly a bad thing.<br /><br />In those other films the evil of society had been either, capitalism, socialism, the super rich, corporations, religion, or science. The irony of the film/book is that it makes fun of the viewer/reader for enjoying it. They are the problem with today's voyeuristic dummy down society, which like the movie can be divided into two groups&#34; Those who see the movie/games as entertainment. And the intellectuals who realize the metaphor contained within. I'm loving it! (Pardon my pop culture response, but it seems apropos.)<br /><br />There is a stark contrast in wealth and dress between those who participate in the games and the society who runs them. However, it is those who participate who ultimately empower those who run them, just like with war, the second message of the film which dates from Homer &#34;War is old men lying, young men dying.&#34;<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence, who I thought was Oscar worthy in &#34;Winter's Bone,&#34; immediately becomes our heroine when she volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger Games. We don't expect her to die anytime soon. As the fighting begins I kept wondering if they were going to simply fight for everyone's entertainment or are we going to get a Captain Kirk/Agorn moment when he has defeated his opponent and refuses to kill him shouting, &#34;You are going to have to get your entertainment elsewhere!&#34; Or maybe we could end it like &#34;Death Race 2000&#34; where Frankenstein kills the president...but I am getting way ahead of myself.<br /><br />The victims, or tributes as they are called, are paraded and cheered having done nothing...similar to reality show TV &#34;stars.&#34; (Yes I mean you talentless Snooki.) People wildly cheer because...they can. Woody Harrelson helps to bridge the time from when Jennifer Lawrence is selected until the fighting begins. Donald Sutherland appears as an unrealistic unlikeable President Snow, a composite character representing the evil of society. There are interviews and pageantry prior to the games during which time we get to know more about Jennifer and very little about the other contestants. It would have been nice to have known some of the quirky combatants and have them killed in ironic ways to their character, but maybe that was too much to ask about a film about shallow entertainment.<br /><br />Jennifer, with her honesty and rebellious attitude has become the fan favorite and our favorite because she is the only contestant that we know. She lacks the killer instinct...until she must. Alliances form and everyone wants to get the fan favorite aka Rambette Jennifer Lawrence, who did an excellent job to give girls a heroine being both a compassionate woman and a huntress. Like all reality TV shows, when the drama starts to fade the program directors add an element to push it in the direction that they want.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. &#34;Safe&#34; for kids to watch.ing, &#34;You are going to have to get your entertainment elsewhere!&#34; Or maybe we could end it like &#34;Death Race 2000&#34; where Frankenstein kills the president...but I am getting way ahead of myself.<br /><br />The victims, or tributes as they are called, are paraded and cheered having done nothing...similar to reality show TV &#34;stars.&#34; (Yes I mean you talentless Snooki.)

B005LAII0S|5.0|The film at times, satirizes the fairy tale. Julia Roberts as the wicked Queen step-mom narrates in the beginning. Lilly Collins as Snow White was made to look like Jennifer Connolly in \\"Labyrinth.\\" The humor is simple and basic enough for everyone to enjoy. There are some minor hidden political commentary for us adults. Such as when Julia instructs Brighton (Nathan Lane) to use his imagination and tell the people \\"bread is meat\\" (ketchup is a vegetable).  But the film doesn't get bogged down trying to be political, it is just a fun film about aging women desperately attempting to hold on to their youth while competing with their daughter for suitors. (I didn't mention Kardashian.)<br /><br />The background is CG which gives the film a fairy tale look. The dwarfs are quirky and more akin to the ones we knew in \\"Time Bandits\\" than the bumbling group Disney gave us. They made good use of the sound track, one that could have been used in any film from 1935 to 1970...until the end when they did some ridiculous lip-sync song, directed at the young princesses in the audience. You could tell Julia Roberts had fun making this production.<br /><br />The film is basically kid safe, some violence and \\"horror\\". Enjoyable for an adult. This is the film you volunteer to take the kids to go see.

0439023483|1.0|I do not even know where to begin - this is one of the worst books i have ever read. The fact that many people give it great ratings is just another thing which makes me want to weep.<br /><br />Let me start by simply listing what this book has NOT:<br /><br />* Depth<br />* Wit or intelligence of any sorts<br />* A captivating plot<br />* A love story<br />* Interesting character portrayal<br />* Exciting Action<br /><br />Based on the hype about the movie i was happy to get this book on my kindle, and i started reading it in high hopes.<br /><br />This book is nothing than a very bad attempt of \\"just another\\" dystopian story - but it is lacking anything which could make such a book interesting or entertaining.<br /><br />It starts out with that the characters and the plot itself is nothing else than a series of stereotypes. Even by using stereotypical characters and a stereotypical plot, the author could have done it with some depth or given it a unique twist, but she did not.<br /><br />The characters are kept shallow and uninteresting and slide from one predictable situation to the other. At no point in the book will you reach a moment where you can't stop reading (which would otherwise be a sign of a good and entertaining book) - and once you arrive at a halfway \\"interesting\\" part in the book its so stereotypical and predictable what will happen it borders ridiculousness.<br /><br />Unlike some other authors who created witty, smart, intelligent, thrilling dystopian, post-apocalytic stories in the past, this book has no unique twist to it. It's simply shallow. It doesn't create emotions because it lacks them. No excitement, no action, no thrill, no love, no wit, no humor.<br /><br />Knowing that the book doesn't have to necessarily be a literary \\"master piece\\" full with wit and cleverness, some could at least have expected an entertaining book. A story does not need to be deep and the book could still be entertaining and in some say \\"satisfying\\" as a good but easy read Heck, it could even have turned out a romance/love story for those who like such books, or a book merely focused on the action aspect alone.<br /><br />But nothing of this ever happens, respective only stays very shallow on the surface wanting the reader beg for more - but ultimately never happens.<br /><br />This book is like some quickly written \\"run-off-the-mill\\" book which fails in almost all aspects, regardless what expectations you might have. If you want a romance/love story, you can have better and deeper buying a $1 novel in your grocery store. The same if you'd be the type who prefers some action/SciFi story...i am sure you find a better one at the checkout in the grocery store.<br /><br />It is almost painful seeing that, despite the plot being a stereotypical dystopian story which has been done countless times in the past already, it could have been done MUCH better in almost all and any aspects.<br /><br />Yes, i really think this book was as bad as it can only get. It's awful. I am glad i read it because i now can read better books on my kindle.

I first picked it up because the title and the simplicity of the cover appealed to me. I love how interactive it is: \\"press the dot\\", \\"shake the book\\", \\"clap your hands.\\" (Now, this could be because I'm easily entertained.) From a time of \\"magic\\" that we live in (with Harry Potter being a literary giant), children that read this will be astounded by how their actions can \\"move\\" the dots. As you flip the pages, it seems as though the dots actually respond to what the reader does.<br /><br />Even though this book is aimed towards the younger readers, people of all age can pick it up and enjoy it.<br /><br />\\"The single touch of a fingers<br />sparks a whimsical dance of color<br />and motion in this joyful celebration<br />of the power of imagination.\\"(back cover)
0307956350|4.0|The book set mostly in Luxembourg mirrors my notions of Luxembourg as it moves from winter into spring --  gray, slow and  eventually brilliant with color.  I honestly slogged through the first 3/4 of the book wondering when Pavone would pick up the pace.<br />And when he did, oh boy. Kate's consistent angst got to be a bit relentless. Glad I read it?  Yes.  Well written.  The central character is rich.  Enjoy it.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|With all of the crap Hollywood has pumped out over the past decade, this is till one of the most appealing movies I've seen and have been waiting to see up on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />To be honest, it's not the most compelling plot nor does it contain the most rich characters, but if you want to see an essay on acceptance and diversity in everyday life, this is an excellent allegory.<br /><br />The acting is decent, and even good by present standards, and the plot is compelling. Though there is some predictability the overall feel lacks the predictability of modern hand holding creations.<br /><br />All in all I would highly recommend this, and would in a like minded fashion recommend Gattaca as a similar essay on the failures of the distopian mentality of the US that continue to be relevant 15 years after either of these movies were made...
0061726834|4.0|Lena Haloway can't wait to be cured of love. In exactly 95 days, on her 18th birthday, she will be safe, no longer haunted by the grief and shame of her mother's suicide, and the loss of her father. She will probably no longer be as passionate about photography or running, and will likely lose her connection to her best friend Hana, but that is a small price to pay for a calm and love-free future. But then she meets Alex, and everything she has known all her life begins to unravel, thread by thread.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's Delirium is set in a future Portland USA, protected by electrified fences and controlled by curfews and citizen's raiding parties. It is 64 years since love was identified as a disease, and 43 years since the cure was perfected. The borders of the United States are closed.<br /><br />Males and females are strictly segregated until the cure is administered at age 18. It is not yet safe to do the procedure on children, but scientists are working on that. There is no more hatred in the United States, and hardly any crime.<br /><br />The only real blemish on the whole beautiful system is the Invalids, resisters who refuse the cure, and escape to the Wilds beyond the fences - people so ill that they don't even realise they are sick. For love is `the deadliest of all deadly things: It kills you both when you have it and when you don't' (4).<br /><br />The narrative opens the day before Lena's evaluation - possibly the most important day of her life. The score she receives will determine with whom she will be paired for life, once she has been cured - a list of four or five approved matches from whom she can choose. Lena prepares diligently, but there is little she can do about her in-between physical appearance - neither thin nor fat, neither ugly nor pretty.<br /><br />Her best friend Hana - tall, gorgeous and confident - is assured of a good score and a good match. Nevertheless, Hana seems dissatisfied with the process, and Lena is increasingly worried about her, looking for signs of the deliria that claimed Lena's mother and very nearly destroyed her older sister as well.<br /><br />Lena is a card-carrying advocate of the passionless society the cure has created, but then, within days, she meets Alex, a guy who makes her feel things that terrify her. Lena hurtles towards a crisis the reader knows cannot be avoided; our only uncertainty is whether Lena + Alex will end in joy or tragedy.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person by Lena, and this technique works well in a novel where the perspective of the protagonist effectively IS the story. As Lena discovers that her safe world is actually a totalitarian nightmare, the reader learns about it with her, from within her viewpoint within the system. The narrative is also told in the present tense, a device that is so often awkward, and yet Oliver somehow makes it work seamlessly.<br /><br />Oliver has a deft touch with description. A `string of bright white buildings, glistening like teeth over the slurping mouth of the ocean' (13). Salt blowing off the sea making the air `feel textured and heavy' (14). Heat that is `horrible, thick, clotting on the walls' (116). A day that turns Lena's world upside down but `still the sun rises and clouds mass and drift and people shop for groceries and toilets flush and blinds go up and down' (302).<br /><br />The sex and profanity content of the book is restrained, befitting a young adult audience. There are moments of moderate violence, but they are not gratuitous. The treatment of religion is thought-provoking; a perversion of Christian texts and ideas, similar-but-different to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. In Huxley's book, God was replaced with consumerism, and every reference to the cross became a T, in homage to Ford's Model T. In Oliver's book, God is retained but recast in the government's image: a passionless ruler of a race of automatons.<br /><br />However, this book is a lot more fun than the dystopianclassics. There's the occasional warning about post-9/11 civil rights abuses lurking within for those who want to see them. But ultimately, Delirium doesn't seem to be trying to be a cautionary tale, just a cracking good read. Its central premise is not political but existential: `You can't really be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes' (23). And unlike the dystopian classics, it allows a little kernel of hope to germinate: perhaps the evil system can be overthrown after all?classics.

The bottom line is-if you believe in the Word of God and the Holy Bible, there are MANY contradictory statements made by Anita in this book. You can't believe both. Read it carefully. And as far as the book itself-the last few chapters are repetitive, same words, different sentences.
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|It's been seven years since I read Jonathan Safran Foer's audacious [[ASIN:0547735022 2005 novel]] which despite its deliberate ties to 9/11, left me a bit cold. Director Stephen Daldry ([[ASIN:B001VEE5KK The Reader]]) and screenwriter Eric Roth ([[ASIN:B002C4YYEU The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]) have adapted the contemporary plot from the book eschewing the foundational World War II flashback which provided much of the emotional springboard for the 9/11-triggered events that engulf the young protagonist, Oskar, a precocious and lonely eleven-year-old living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Foer challenged the reader by making Oskar borderline autistic in order to dissect the psychological devastation induced by 9/11 in its most basic terms with the loss of his father. Daldry and Roth wisely chose a first-time actor, Thomas Horn, to embody Oskar as someone more experienced would have likely come across as too mannered and sympathetic for such a polarizing figure. On the other hand, Horn, a former Jeopardy! champion, embodies the character's sharp intellect, lack of amiability, and monomaniacal sense of purpose with surprising acuity. It's either an impressive debut or an exhausting one-shot performance as he is in almost every scene of the film.<br /><br />On his own idiosyncratic terms, Daldry attempts to present 9/11 as a malevolent, almost surreal act that turns an otherwise banal and safe world into one of seeping paranoia and immeasurable fear. Still reeling from the World Trade Center death of his gregarious, life-loving father Thomas, Oskar has hidden the phone machine, on which his father left six messages, away from his low-key attorney mother Linda. A year after the tragedy, the troubled boy finds a unique way to deal with his grief when he inadvertently breaks a blue vase in his father's closet as he rifles through his father's effects hoping for some kind of message left behind. Finding an envelope with a key inside the broken vase, Oskar notices the envelope is marked \\"Black\\", and his imagination reels with what he thinks is the legacy of his father's scavenger hunts. Tethered to nothing in the way of logic, he sets out across the breadth of New York City to meet and question all 472 people named Black in the phone book, so he can find out what the key unlocks. This is where Oskar's quest takes flight as he bounces from one encounter to another looking for a clue.<br /><br />Joining him for much of his journey is the Renter, a mute tenant that his grandmother shelters in her apartment across the street. His identity holds a certain clue to the mystery surrounding his father but not the one Oskar is looking for. The boy also intersects with a divorcing couple who tie into another thread of the mystery. As it does in the source novel, all of the events and character tics come across as rather contrived to support the 9/11 allegory being presented, even though the film itself is handsomely produced with first-rate camerawork by Chris Menges. The performances by the rest of the cast compensate as well. In small supporting roles despite their star billing, Tom Hanks is ideally cast as Thomas, and Sandra Bullock - in her first role since [[ASIN:B002VECM6S The Blind Side]] - brings quiet dignity and strength to Linda. Viola Davis ([[ASIN:B006IGZWB2 The Help]]) and Jeffrey Wright ([[ASIN:B006X4MW30 The Ides of March]]) make vivid cameo impressions as the angst-filled couple, while Max Von Sydow ([[ASIN:B001WLMOG4 The Seventh Seal]]) does wonders in a restrained turn as the Renter. But the film's emotional burden never really elevates the themes that Daldry wants desperately to convey in a sea of contrivance. Ultimately, this narrative burden makes 9/11 fade into the background more than it should, and one is left with the forlorn feeling that the event has been more exploited than explored.e envelope is marked \\"Black\\", and his imagination reels with what he thinks is the legacy of his father's scavenger hunts.

B0074EIQQU|2.0|I agree with other reviewers that this album presents \\"haunted dreamscapes\\" that are quite interesting, but the end result just doesn't captivate this listener.  With the loss of Owens and Frusciante, it seems to me that TMV retreated into studio obsession and forgot that a good song (and a good album) must be more than the sum of its multitudinous parts (interestingly, the change in drummer didn't really hurt; Parks actually stands out here and that's saying something after the unrestrained power and speed of Prigden.  Parks has a similar approach to drumming...).  Cedric's more honest lyrical portrayal in this album reveals a voice that actually needed all the effects and processing that characterized past albums.  Songs like Vedamalady typify the album:  the intro soundscape raises interest, but once the song proper starts, there just isn't much there - major key waffling with carefully orchestrated electronic overlays.  I waited for the song to be over so I could hear the next one and hope something saves this album.<br /><br />Other reviewers are correct that TMV routinely changes their sound, also that they seem to enjoy creating all kinds of drama around their \\"musical process.\\"  This is a fun part of rock and roll.  De-Loused got me into the band, Bedlam is perfect when you want to feel like your head is next to a jet engine (I mean it for real, it is one of the loudest, most frenetic and yet listenable albums I've ever heard), and Octahedron included hints of what was to come in this release - soundscapes, dreamscapes, songs that stand on their own.  In Octahedron, however, TMV remembered that it takes a band to make an album, not just endless hours of obsession in the studio and lots of drama about their production and artistic values.<br /><br />(ok, Zed and Two Naughts - that's ZOO, right - almost did save the album.  Had to wait until the last song?)

145162445X|5.0|Lawrence M. Krauss is a brilliant scientist.  Universe from nothing is a mind blowing book.  This book is an eye opener about how our universe will end and expand forever, that in over 100 billion years we won't be able to see galaxies outside our local cluster.  It is unfortunate people are wasting time and money reading books on religion and worse preaching religious dogma in schools and universities when true beauty is science.  Keep up the good work Lawrence.  I would someday like to watch a documentary on TV created by Lawrence Krauss similar to Cosmos by Carl Sagan.

B007E6YYLO|5.0|If you are a Walking Dead fan, 18 Miles Out is a must see episode.  I won't spoil it but the second half of the second season is FANTASTIC!!  The first half of the season was a little repetitive and the characters seemed to argue about the same things over and over.  But the show really hit its stride again mid-season.  So, if you were losing a little interest and stopped watching, definitely check this episode out.  You'll be hooked again!

B002MQYOFW|1.0|For the book club I am in, I thought it would be fun to pick a book that the younger generation was reading . . .I was so hoping that if I decided to read a book that was being mass marketed to this age group,that it would be well written and an original story . . .instead I found more of the same that we worry so much about with our children and what they see in video games and movies ... video games that most parents agree are nothing but babysitting violent entertainment--yet kids are still allowed to watch/play them??? . . . basically killing characterless humans while getting rewards/powers all along the way to fuel up to kill more? . . .now, this philosophy of entertainment is not just available to young kids in video games . . . it is now available in glorified books and the huge media hype that follows . . . although there was a slight thread of a story line and superficial characters within the story . . .this book has basically the plot for a video game---which I have no doubt, to keep the money ball rolling, is already being developed if not already out on the market for kids to start \\"playing\\".<br />I know there are great writers out there for young adults, and I will wade through this sort of sludge to find them

B0050VI5SI|4.0|In summary, this album is great. It's short but a whopping 7 out of 10 tracks are strong.<br /><br />My only complaint is how they choose to mix/record the treble throughout the album. The treble has that metallic, sterile, tin-can sound that you also find on MP3s created at 128kbps or lower. I have to assume it was a stylistic decision as the album was recorded professionally. It's a shame really. It was either a sound they were going for intentionally or they need to find a few recording studio ASAP!
1451627289|4.0|There Is nothing quite like wondering about what would have happened if... The life of John F Kennedy was tragically cut short in 1963, leaving much of the world in shock.<br /><br />Stephen King tries to answer these questions in this fascinating tale. He presumes that if Kennedy would have survived the assassin's bullets much of the troubled 1960s would have been different. For example, if JFK lived, would his brother Bobby have been killed? Would Martin Luther King lived? If he continued his Presidency, his opposition to escalating the \\"police action\\" in Southeast Asia may have stopped the Vietnam War before it started, saving many thousands of lives? Would Richard Nixon have taken the White House and caused the decline in trust in the government because of his role in Watergate?<br /><br />The genius of the story is in how King meets this challenge head on and weaves an intriguing story that is far out, yet reasonable. If you can suspend your belief in the seeming impossibility of time travel, and the ability to change the past to alter the present, this book presents a well thought out alternate history. A history with a Stephen King twist.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is in a class of its own.  Ana and Christian are so delicious and dynamic in their relationship. I feel like I could step into their lives.  Wish all fiction could rise to this standard.  Need more from this author.  Could she top this?  Superlative.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I finally decided to buy my own copy of Season 1 of Spartacus after seeing it on Netflix and then checking it out from the City Library twice. I loved Andy Whitfield in this role and was extremely saddened to learn he lost his bout with cancer. Such a wonderful actor with that magical ability to convey so much emotion with his face and eyes. It didn't hurt that he was a handsome man either and his love scenes were something to behold. (My own personal opinion, of course). I haven't yet seen Season 2 with the new actor Liam McIntyre but I will reserve judgement. Although no one can take the place of Andy as the original Spartacus for me, Liam will have big shoes to fill in his endeavor to make his own mark in this role. I wish him much success and look forwarding to seeing Season 2 and hopefully Season 3 of Spartacus.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I wasn't so sure about this movie, having seen the original trilogy, which I think is outstanding.  I'm not too big of a fan of remakes, often finding them disappointing knockoffs.<br /><br />That isn't the case here.  The story is riveting, with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) dominating every scene, and rightly so.  Her character is connected to the mystery being solved, and the retribution that's dished out.<br /><br />Daniel Craig did a good job with his character, and took the appropriate 2nd seat to Lisbeth.<br /><br />This movie holds its own, and is no knockoff.<br /><br />It's not disappointing at all.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3R42XXP3SHG0K]]I could not be happier with this CPU.  I really wanted HD Graphics 3000 that is built into the chip, which (1) has built in optimizations for HD video playback and conversions, (2) can offer a lower power usage than some power hungry graphics cards (less power, less cost, less heat, less noise from less heat to exhaust, and more reliability from lower heat), (3) is better than many entry level discrete graphics cards.  Of course it doesn't really compare to the current generation of expensive high end graphics cards that cost almost as much as this chip, but it gives others a run for their money.  I really wanted to make sure that viewing, editing, and converting video from my HD video camera was as optimized as possible, which is what HD Graphics 3000 can uniquely offer by being optimized right on the CPU.  In terms of power, my system idles at about 50W.<br /><br />The stock fan provided with the retail version is all that you need if you are not overclocking and have a case with decent airflow, like the [[ASIN:B004WK3KKQ Cooler Master Storm Enforcer]].  The desktop tools monitor (from my [[ASIN:B005PBJF6O Intel DZ68BC motherboard]]) always shows that I am running at the low end of heat ranges for the CPU and temperature in my case.  Heat hasn't remotely been a problem.  I don't think the fan is whisper quiet though.  However, there 2 important things to mention. (1) The power cable comes wrapped around the fan in what looks like cable management that you don't have to unwrap all the way.  But the problem is the cable actually comes into contact with the fan blades at a few places that you might not notice at first.  This would make noise, cause cooling problems, or burn up the chip if you don't unwrap it.  I thought at first I could just uncoil a tiny bit to plug to the connector right next to it, but I am really glad I caught that.  The instructions made no mention.  (2) It didn't snap easily into place like the instructions say.  I had to use a screwdriver to turn the nuts in the end on a few posts, but overall was easy, but I had to use a screwdriver despite instructions that said otherwise.<br /><br />The 2700K versus this 2600K offers only 100MHz more, that's all, and is only a fractional improvement.  So you just need to calculate the cost difference between the 2700K and 2600K and see if that is worth a measly 100MHz or not.  If only a very small cost difference, I would definitely go with the 2700K.  If a moderate or large difference, I wouldn't pay too much for only 100MHz.  When I bought my i7-2600K, I would have had to pay 22% more to get far less of a gain in processing power.  I have zero regrets with going with the i7-2600K and not waiting around for the 2700K to be a perfect value.
0756407125|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this book. I could barely put it down. I can't even say for sure exactly what it was, but I really enjoy all of the characters, and I enjoy reading about his day-to-day challenges at the University, and his slowly developing relationship with Denna. And I also really enjoy Devi a lot.<br /><br />And then there's the second half of the book. I just felt like he kept running off on tangents that I simply did not care about. It would've been okay if he didn't just spend SO LONG on them. Ademre was the worst. I was so unbearably bored. And these people are problematic. They don't consider sex to be terribly intimate, and they're totally fine with people having multiple partners. And that's ok. They don't believe in fathers. Which I suppose since they don't practice monogamy, that would make some sense, since they would have difficulty ever identifying who someone's father was. But I don't mean that they don't feel fathers are relevant. I mean they believe that women spontaneously get pregnant for no reason, and that men have nothing to do with it. Apparently they've never noticed the lack of virgin mothers. And they must not practice animal husbandry of any kind. This is just so implausible. I was just so sick of it by the time he finally left there.<br /><br />Overall, I still enjoyed it.

030788743X|5.0|Being into the 80's, when my friend recommended this book I thought why not.  What an enjoyable read! The main Character is a truly likable one who seriously has too much time on his hands and knows EVERYTHING about 80's culture: Music, video games and their respective consoles, Movies, Anime, Tv shows etc. It's a blast from the past.  Fortunately for him all those hours pay off when he searches for the ultimate Easter Egg that gives the finder the entire fortune of a deceased game designer (somewhere on par with Steve Jobs.  )<br /><br />Set in an alternate reality where the world has gone to hell and most people spend more time in the Oasis virtual reality system then in the real world, this is an engaging read about one geek-nerds coming of age.<br /><br />Fun book!

0062119044|5.0|'We Need to Talk About Kevin' is quite a literary accomplishment.  The author is fully deserving of accolades for her achievement.  On the surface the story is reminiscent of 'The Bad Seed' where the notion of evil being a result of nature (versus nurture) is raised.  But this book is far more complex.  It is really a deep self-analysis of the evil child's mother.  Her husband thinks she's insane for thinking their son is anything beyond normal.  Yet she knows the truth, is torn with both love and hatred for the child, and in the end it all goes horribly wrong.  I think the author was very clever in structuring this book as a series of letters from the mother to the father; I thought it made the entire story more personal and emotional.  ... oh, and the book's ending is quite powerful.<br /><br />Bottom line: a very sad yet terrific read.  Strongly recommended.

It would be nice if it drilled down to the day when selecting it, but not a big deal. It works.

B007LE3PXW|5.0|I really enjoyed this album- one of her best.  The music is varied in style, and has an eclectic, confessional vibe to it.  Many catchy tunes that get caught in your head, and two great ballads.  So great for summer driving!

B005LAII0I|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this movie on opening day, and I'm so glad I did! In brief, it's a modern \\"twist\\" on the classic Snow White story. (The main twist being that Snow White ends up saving the prince.) But there are plenty more... you will not get bored! :) One aspect I loved about this movie was that there is a \\"price for using magic,\\" which the Queen keeps ignoring. Most movies that involve magic don't bother with the subject. Everything has a consequence, and magic is no exception. The dwarves are not what you'd expect, either. This is a refreshing twist. While their names still tell about their individual characters, they're almost nothing like the cartoon dwarves. An emotional aspect is brought into play during the story as well, where we learn why they act the way they do. (I don't want to give too much away, so just go see the movie!)<br /><br />Overall, the movie was super funny, yet it still had serious themes interwoven throughout (such as Snow White's and the dwarves' backstories). There is a definite darkness always lurking in the background, but the humor does a wonderful job of lightening it to the point where you just \\"go along with it.\\" We all know how the story goes anyway, right? (Well, a few things are turned around, but the basic gist is the same.) I know any parents and grandparents out there are wondering whether it's kid friendly. I would say yes, but maybe not for the really small kids. There aren't any bad words, no violence, and anything bad that happens-- for the most part-- is accompanied by laugh-out-loud antics. The reason I say not really little kids is only because they might not be able to follow the story very well; the movie gave a feel of being directed toward a more mature audience, even though it was clean enough to be a family movie. There's enough humor that the entire family should come out of it having some favorite scene which made them laugh aloud. (Mine involves some life-size puppets...) :) I end my review with an enthusiastic recommendation: if you've been tossing the idea around in your head whether or not to see this movie, GO SEE IT!!! It will be well worth your time!nthusiastic recommendation: if you've been tossing the idea around in your head whether or not to see this movie, GO SEE IT!!! It will be well worth your time!
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I should be giving this a one star for the box art, but I like the movie too much to do that and I don't want to affect the rating negatively. But let me first say the movie is fantastic. It really its a shame for it to be a flop at the box office because it makes people think it sucks when it doesn't. The story of John Carter being teleported to Mars is interesting enough to keep you hooked all the way through, with enough action to satisfy. But it's not perfect. I'll be the first to defend this movie but I will make fun of it right after. First of all, the Princess is a joke though at times I found her to be a definitive competent heroine. But she's bound by the Disney cliches such as \\"I can't marry the Evil Man, I don't love him!\\" Been there, done that, and even John Carter himself pokes fun at the cliche by saying \\"Is that all there is?\\" So points to the movie by addressing the cliches it creates and that's nice. I like how the movie becomes aware of the cliches and will even crack jokes about it. It's not a comedy by any means but the comic relief is nice. But the Princess really did annoy me at times.<br /><br />Overall this movie should have been a success but ultimately it was a gamble that didn't pay off. Evidently it cost $250 Million with another $100 Million for marketing to make this movie. And I'll be honest folks, I have no idea where that money went. I saw it and yes the special effects were nice but they weren't $250 MILLION nice. And how they did the marketing, I don't know. I only saw the trailer by chance and no one in my family even heard about it. Let alone anyone at work. So the movie was overblown and under-marketed. Add that to the obscure source material and no name actors (besides Mark Strong and Willem Defoue) and you've got a movie that is so desperate to make its money that we can now pre-order the Blu-ray not even a month from its original release.<br /><br />And it's a shame, because this movie WAS good! But, too much of \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" ultimately added to what financially is described as a \\"Flop\\".<br /><br />The Box Art doesn't help either. I mean what an unappealing picture is that. It's too much and at the same time too bland. Yellow bold text on an orange/blue background with white blind apes, and two pics of John Carter. This should have been way more subtle. They should have just taken the wallpaper of the bold orange background and near-silhouette John Carter and just slapped in on the box.<br /><br />So again, good movie with great action and decent plot, but unfortunately not only did it fail to make a profit, but now it's got a Box Art that is unlikely to make you interested.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I've had my PRC 200 for about 3 years now and its still my go-to watch.  I have several vintage and new watches, but for ease of use and time keeping, you really can't beat this Swiss quartz movement.<br /><br />My watch has a metal bracelet and black dial.  The sapphire crystal remains perfectly clear and unscratched after 3 years of use.  The bracelet does not pinch or grab hairs and the physical size of the watch is not ridiculously large like some new styles.  I swim with this watch now and then (no diving or snorkeling) and I sometimes work in a prototype shop.  This watch has held up fantastically<br /><br />As far as the warranty goes, if you buy a deeply discounted watch on Amazon or Overstock, you should figure that you are purchasing a \\"grey market\\" watch.  These are watches that are either discontinued models, have been purchased in lots from stores going out of business, or warehouses clearing surplus stock.  As such, they will almost never come with the manufacturers warranty.  That is part of what you are paying for when you pay retail price in a store, thus, why you are getting a discount now.<br /><br />Fantastic, quality Swiss watch at a fantastic price!

B004UHPU5E|4.0|What a great idea to bring in Mel Collins! What a warm feeling I got. And it works really well. I love Islands. So pastoral. The Island band and album was so underrated (perhaps because of the next \\"big three\\" juggernauts that were to follow). Funny that Collins would return after all these years and play on the most pastoral album since Islands. I love the ambience and soundscapes too. Levin's ensemble playing, his tone and restraint is beautiful. Fripp, Collins and Levin really turn in a great performance. And there is nothing wrong with a fully pastoral album. Consider it as a scene in a movie, or an act in a symphonic work. Forty-five minutes of mellow is beautiful.<br /><br />Honesty I haven't bought the album to see who wrote what, but the music is great, as well as the execution of it. For this style of music, they brought THE correct KC veterans in. But I have to say I don't like Jaksyzk's voice.. (I need to give it more time though, and listen to some of his other work as I'm not that familiar with him). But as I hear it now, it's too soulful for this music (and maybe Collins at times too). He's great at what he does, no doubt. I just don't like soulful singing over pastoral music. This style you really need a certain type of lyric tenor or baritone, or a \\"Mozart tenor\\" (look it up). That would have made this album soar. I didn't like Belew's voice too much either at first but he made great effect of it and it suited that music so well that one can't imagine that era of KC without him, right?. I didn't get that same impression with Jaksyzk. I can't think of a past KC singer that could really bring out the style of this music quite right. Maybe an young Lake? (Just have to mention, I'm a Wetton guy all the way, but not for this music).<br /><br />All of the songs are great, especially 'The Price We Pay', as well as the execution of the tunes. A more lyrical singer would had made it 5 stars. Enjoy the listen!

B0061QD7YS|5.0|This film is a classic and very enjoyable for all ages. It's a great one to watch along with the kids and grandkids. The little ones will want to watch it over and over. It's available to watch in Spanish and French as well, so language learners can improve their listening skills.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|At first, I thought the book will have a lengthy and dry historical background about Stalin times Russia. Nevertheless, it was just about right. The author gave sufficient knowledge to set the tone, and it made things quite interesting. I read the book in a week. It dragged me into the plot and I could not put it down. Author's writing style definitely helped, even during historical and background-informative moments. One disappointment is at the end. I always waited for some detail on forensics, or at least some hunch about the killer, but the plot kept diverting to some larger scale issue, such as homophobia and conspiracy. Then, eventually when the killer is known....I feel like something is missing or is not fully solved.....eghhhh

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the first book because students at school were required to read it.  So happy that I did.  Great, can't put it down for a minute, read.  Written for teens, enjoyable for everyone. Collins crafts a picture of a bleak future where the ultimate in reality TV pits young people against each other in a \\"last person standing wins\\" battle of skill and wits.  Characters you can believe and relate to.  Watched the movie, which was excellent, but the book really gets inside the mind of the heroine of the story and we are enchanted and inspired by her from the word go.  Most highly recommend it.  Each book takes us further into Katniss' world with the same writing skill. It is turning non-readers into readers for all the right reasons!!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Oh.My.God.  I am very upset that i have to wait roughly a year to see what happens next!!  Requim will be the 3rd and final book in The Delirium series :-(<br />Lena has escaped to the Wilds and yet, lost the 1 person she was escaping for in the process.  Thrown in with this group of \\"invalids\\" Lena is slowly learning everything she knew, everything she was told was a lie.  She struggles but learns to adapt as she rebuilds her strength and her life.<br />The story goes back and forth with chapters titled \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\"... Then is actually now when Lena is in the Wilds, how she struggles to adapt and survive when her entire world is litterally turned upside down!  Now is when Lena ventures back to the City, Now is when Lena meets Julian, The head of the DHA's son. I found myself liking Julian as a love interest for Lena more so than Alex, what happens between them you will have to read to find out.<br />Pandemonium is packed with action and suspense; you often don't know which side a particular character is on or where Lena and Julian will end up.  This is what makes it so spectaculiar!<br />Warning........... the ending, cliffhanger, will leave your jaw on the floor and have you saying WTH?!

B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Dirty Harry is just one of those things that you either love or hate. This is an excellent collection not only because it contains all five movies but also due to the extras that is offered. I wouldn't be surprised if literally everything about Harry is included. Upon rewatching these movies I was surprised at how much I've forgetten and confused details in one movie with another; plus I'm now convinced I've only viewed most of them on syndicated TV because there were many parts I don't recall at all.<br /><br />Having said all that I certainly wouldn't say it's family-friendly entertainment. It may be cheesy/campy 70s & 80s movies but watch at your own risk. Regarding the packaging, I'm curious about the French translation under the English? Is DH big in France or were these disks made there? Not a big deal, and it didn't effect my review, it just seemed strange to me. If you're either a DH or even a Clint Eastwood fan, get this collection! There's only five movies, why not get them all at once?

S1 of TCW is a great start to what is now going on it's 5th season. However, this show is not for everybody, particularly old-school die-hard fans such as myself. There is some obvious contempt to EU continuity on this show as a whole but if I can overlook (at least some) of that then I would think most other long-time fans could too. Along with S2, the cover and booklet inside is both a sight to see and an excellent choice IMO; though for some reason S3 stopped doing this and upset a bunch of fans. If you're a fan of SW and tolerate Anakin's questionable new padawan, or if you'd like to get your kids involved in SW, then I would definately recommend this season.

Heck, I like the way some things were done in the movie better than in the book and that says a lot!

I have not seen a movie that has had such a grand effect on me when I left the theatre as this one!<br /><br />This is one Awesome movie that everyone needs to have in their collection. On second thought, buy two copies, because this like no other movie will be watched over and over and will test just how long a DVD will last.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|As a confirmed baseball junkie, I really wanted to see this movie when in was in theaters, but had to wait for the DVD release. I was generally familiar with the back story (although as I watched it wondered how I had managed to forget the improbable winning streak that takes this film towards it climax), and I'm also familiar with some of the criticism for the liberties this movie may (or may not) have taken with actual facts.<br /><br />Forget about all that. If you're a baseball fan, you will almost certainly love this movie...and you'll love it even more if you're the fan of a small-market team that's not the Yankees or the Red Sox (and are exhausted with the adoration of those franchises as staples of prime-time TV offerings). If you're not a baseball fan, you can still expect to enjoy this story of Billy Beane (Bradd Ptt), former big-leaguer and, in 2001, general manager of the cash-strapped Oakland A's. How cash-strapped are they? The players have to pay for sodas from a vending machine in the clubhouse (and during a later trade, Beane asks for soda supplies in partial compensation for a player).<br /><br />After the A's lose in the playoffs to the Yankees and three major players leave, Beane must find a way to rebuild his roster. An encounter with a new Cleveland Indians employee and Bill James statistics disciple Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) sets the wheels in motion for Beane to adopt a stat-based approach to finding the best players.<br /><br />The metrics create tension with his current scouting staff, most of whom are played by themselves and who are shown frequently including many other \\"intangibles\\" (including the attractiveness of a player or his girlfriend) in their calculations of player potential. It also creates tension with field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose range is rapidly making him one of my favorite actors).<br /><br />Pitt as Beane shows us a man who is alternately cutthroat, competitive, calculating, superstitious...and then suddently contemplative as he gains buy-in and attention for the unlikely success of his low-budget approach to managing major league talent (and opportunities to to move on to other opportunities).<br /><br />As the film closes and Brand and Beane are contemplating their system, Brand shows Beane footage of one one of their minor league players who is under-regarded because of his weight and apparently scared to death of running beyond first towards second base. If you watch this scene without a lump in in your throat: well, you might be a human being, but your are certainly NOT a baseball fan.<br /><br />Good baseball movie grounded in real wold events.

B0001US62I|5.0|I first viewed this movie in 1987 only because the cover intrigued me so and sparked my curiosity of what could this movie be about. But also seeing who starred in it also sparked interest being a fan of Rourke and DeNiro. Let me first point out this movie is NOT for the squeamish. So if some graphics disturb you than you should pass on this. The movie takes place in 1955 New York. Harry Angel a private gumshoe is contacted by a law firm representing a one Louis Cyphere. Reason for the contact is that Mr. Cyphere wants to hire Mr. Angel to find a client of his who he needs to collect on a \\"vague\\" debt. The client he wants found is an old crooner by the name of Johnny Favorite or aka; Jonathan Liebling. After Mr. Angel contacts one of Johnny's old doctor up in Poughkeepsie he winds up dead. Harry reports back to Mr. Cyphere that he is out of the hunt as he could be a prime suspect. Cyphere baits him with an up front $5000 salary to find Johnny Favorite. You have to remember $5000 is a lot of money in 1955. This gets him on the track down to New Orleans looking for Johnny Favorite. In his searches everyone he comes in contact with who had any dealings with Johnny Favorite they wind up dead with Harry Angel being pointed as the prime suspect. This is as far as I can go with this as I really don't want to spoil this for anyone. All I can say is buy this movie because the ending is worth the price of admission alone and will shock the hell out of you and you won't be able to stop talking about \\"Angel Heart\\" for quite some time. I highly recommend this one. Not hardly a sleeper film.

B0070Z4M4I|1.0|Not a very good prequel as some have stated.  Other then the being, the end, and the Norwegian guys, it is so much like the original you may think you're watching a poorly done remake.  You may give it a chance if you want to waste 3.99 as I did, but it was a waste of money for me.  The Thing (1982) with Kurt Russell is awesome, this movie is eh.  This movie does have up-to-date special FX, but it doesn't improve the movie at all.  All I can say about the FX is \\"Big whoop!\\" (80s joke for us middle aged folks).  I'll take Kurt Russell any day, these actors, who ever they are, do not do this movie justice.  I'm not sure if any of them would do any movie justice. I wanted to like it, but I didn't. NEXT!!!

ALL of them focus on Meryl Streep and here Oscar-winning performance. I have to agree that she is an amazing actress and really inhabits the character of Margaret Thatcher in this film. But the production as a whole seems to last for three hours when, in fact, it is only 105 minutes. The reason is the concept used by Director Phyllidia Lloyd that has the time frame jumping back and forth (AND back and forth, and...) between Thatcher in her final days and at various points in her career. There is the conceit that has her late husband (and childhood sweetheart) Denis, appearing in her mind (and on screen) to converse with her, long after he has died. Personally I was getting a headache with all this time shifting. So, as a film, this only gets three stars from me.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray DVD - and I think the standard DVD - has a large group of special features, though many are short and one is really odd. They consist of:<br /><br />Making the Iron Lady - 12 minutes - the standard \\"making of\\" featurette with the cast and crew making comments among scenes repeated from the film.<br /><br />Recreating the young Margaret Thatcher - 3 minutes<br /><br />Denis, The Man Behind the woman - 2 ½ minutes - focusing on Jim Broadbent's character<br /><br />Battle in the House of Commons -2 ½ minutes - mostly comments by the Director (and some repeats section from the \\"Making of\\" one<br /><br />Costume Design: Pearls and Power Suits - 2 ½ minutes - comments from the costume designer and Director<br /><br />And the odd one: an 18-minute \\"featurette\\" on Historical film bios, that - while interesting - is a promo piece for other recent DVDs of Weinstein Company produced films. We learn about Marilyn Monroe (from film historian Drew Casper and actress Michelle Williams), Wallis Simpson (the film W.E. where we hear from a professor and the film's director Madonna) , The Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget. It seems to have been edited from a longer piece because there is a narrator but no title or credit.<br /><br />So, if you want to see a great actress inhabit a role, this is the film. But if you want to learn a lot about British history during Thatcher's career, I'm afraid this is not the best place to find that.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"Iron Lady (with comments by the book version's author John Campbell and Streep) and one more film I forget.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Like a lot of us, I grew up with Carpenter's Original 'Thing'. There was always a hint of Lovecraftian that I felt on the edges of what issues the film actually focused on: here was a disgusting amalgamation of various creatures, which/whose master plan is unknowable. It is a thing of genius and insanity. It defies us to describe it.<br /><br />Well, they described it pretty well in this, the 'prequel' - a concept that did not sit well with me until I began to see the trailers. Now that I've added this film to my BD collection, the verdict is in (almost; I haven't listened to the commentary tracks just yet. That's tomorrow).<br /><br />The pros:<br /> - This prequel is down to the final detail identical to many of the opening sequence of the original<br /> - This prequel literally leaves off where the first one begins. You can literally watch them all at one go and there will seem to be no noticeable incongruities. It's a 3-hour film.<br /> - The Norwegian cast is great fun to watch together. Americans are the ones that always much things up, eh? Give her a flamethrower and one grenade, and she thinks she's Lara Croft.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /> - There are times that the scenes not only remind us of the \\"original\\", but even the set designs make me feel like they used the same place for both films.<br /> - They run a razor's edge on whether or not they showed The Thing too much. It's a coin toss, mostly because the creature designs are that awesome.<br /><br />As for the special features, they step back up to plate and do almost as good a job as for the BD of Carpenter's film. The deleted scenes are more of scene extensions, and while neat to see it was a smart choice to make the cut. The featurette \\"Fire and Ice\\" literally has the cast and crew running around set and lightning things on fire for the sheer gigglies of it. The main featurette documents the blending of practical and CGI effects and the film maker's dictum to keep as much of it real as possible.<br /><br />Where the original was edge of your seat nail-biting mystery-horror, this new Thing is forced. They forced themselves to adhere to the film classic in all ways. In doing so, it makes the film, in my eyes, not stand out on it's own enough. YMMV, but I'll give them this - it's a hell of a fun ride!<br /><br />>>> EDIT ----- >>> After watching the film again and listening to the commentary, I find I must go back and rate the film at five-stars. The commentary points out both technical goodies as well as Easter eggs scattered sparingly throughout the film. And wouldn't you know it? At the conclusion of the commentary, they suggest immediately watching the Carpenter film. Great minds and all that, eh?br />Where the original was edge of your seat nail-biting mystery-horror, this new Thing is forced. They forced themselves to adhere to the film classic in all ways.

1597801585|5.0|This is a remarkable book. I'm nearing the end but couldn't wait to say how much I love this book. I am listening to it as an Audible.com mp3 - top-notch narrator is a big plus on the audio version! Between the writing and the narration, there is a quality here that I look for and find only in a few books: a sort of hypnotic realism that feels like a vivid dream you have trouble waking up from. (Although this is one dream you will be glad to realize is only a dream - so far, anyway...)<br /><br />I am puzzled by the people saying they couldn't engage with the characters. They ARE extremely complex, and it is indeed difficult to decide who is a bad guy and who is a good guy - they are much more akin to real people than typical sci fi characters. And that's a good thing, to my taste! This is one thing that makes the novel so gripping - the very fact that you identify with each point of view in turn, realizing at the same time that each character has MAJOR flaws as well as major conflicts with the other characters you have been identifying with.<br /><br />When beginning to first listen to this audiobook, I thought I was not going to like it because of the present tense viewpoint used throughout. But perhaps this point of view is why one gets so drawn in and finally can't let go!<br /><br />The tension continues to build throughout as you learn more and more about each character and get a fuller picture of the stakes involved for each, as well as for the larger world.<br /><br />Dystopian fiction is usually not my cup of tea, but this is irresistible!
B007EC27QM|2.0|This would be a great app if the keypad was readable. The size of the buttons is barely adequate. The calculator is visually appealing if you overlook the fact that the keypad labels are absolutely UNREADABLE. This problem needs to be addressed in a timely manner.<br /><br />Just to clarify, this app is installed on a Kindle Fire.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Two things are phenomenal. First, the film is phenomenal. But perhaps even more phenomenal is the lack of original thinking on the part of the negative critics of this film publishing online who have short changed the public of the U.S.A. by being anxious to see a big budget film fail.  They are all repeating each other. In this age of the internet, I doubt that many of the online reviewers have even seen the film. I'm not loyalist-type of fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, or Taylor Kitsch, or even Andrew Stanton,  (though I admit to my fondness of anything Pixar). But this was simply a great film, and so much of what the naysayers have said is simply unintelligent rumor mill-type of reporting of old speculation. Remember Jurrasic Park?  People didn't go see it for the acting, we saw it for the dinosaurs. They looked real. Well in this, The fictionalized Mars of ERB, the Tharks, everything in this is of the grandest scale and it looks REAL. Like a grand elaborate opera, this movie elegantly segues scene to scene, holding your attention from start to finish, and no the acting is not bad. In fact it is excellent. It is a fun, eye-popping action adventure with humor, mystery, suprise, great costumes, great fight scenes, and yes, the guy gets the girl in the end. GO SEE IT IN THE THEATERS WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!!!!!!
0312641893|5.0|There aren't enough stars to do this story justice. 5 out of 5 stars isn't enough. 20 out of 20, closer. This book deserves all the praise and accolades it has received. I can't wait for the next in the series. Thank goodness it's a series.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer really did her homework in researching the origins of the Cinderella fairytale. There are allusions to others as well. I enjoyed reading all the nods to the classic tale, but fully embraced Meyer's reimagining, too. What an amazing twist on a classic fairytale! Cinderella reimagined as a cyborg mechanic is truly amaZING!! Placing the story in New Beijing, a futuristic version of our world, with LUNARS living on the moon. So, so captivating and a quick read. I couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />The romance between Prince Kai and Cinder really made this story. One of the things I'm not keen on is the boring, characterless version of the prince in so many stories. His biggest goal is to find a suitable princess, but he's tired of all the choices in his kingdom. There are undertones of this here, but thankfully, there's also a more fleshed out prince with a compelling storyline and backstory to go with it. One that puts the future of the entire world on the line.<br /><br />You won't be sorry you read this, just that you have to wait for the sequels. I loved the sidekick robot, Iko, and how she and the Dr. were versions of Cinder's Fairy Godmother. The plague, sweeping across the Earth is a virus originated from the Lunars on the moon. The queen wants to marry Prince Kai and establish a peace treaty between the Earth and the Moon, which complicates matters and unwittingly draws Cinder into the conflict at the wired heartbeat of it all.<br /><br />If you haven't read this, DO IT NOW!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I LOVED this game. It was funny to read the reviews where people were losing it because they couldn't figure it out. Common sense people! Not to mention there are hints for the entire game in the journal. Even though I used the hints quite a bit I still found it very challenging. Just remember to keep in mind all of the little things you find throughout the game. They will make sense somewhere later in the game. I recommend this game and actually hated for it to end. Look forward for more of these. Well worth the price.
0307949508|5.0|This book was entirely different from the first novel in the Millennium Trilogy, but still intensely entertaining.  It focuses so much on Lisbeth Salander's past and gave me a better understanding of her character.  Every time I thought I knew which direction the book would go, something dramatic would take it to a whole other level.  There were many familiar characters that were developed very skillfully, and new characters that I anticipate seeing again in the third book.  Everything about this series so far is incredible, and though I'm excited to read The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, I don't want to finish the series, knowing that it's all over.

B004EPZ07K|2.0|I am a comic fan.  As such I demand more from comic book movies than just a casual movie viewer.  I am the guy who notices all the things the film makers got wrong.  \\"How can Superman talk in space?\\"  \\"Wolverine can't have an Admantium bullet pierce his skull!!\\"  \\"Why does Magneto have none of the powers he does in the comic book?\\"  \\"Why doesn't Donald Duck wear pants?\\"  Needless to say I'm a stickler for questions and for details.<br /><br />This movie failed on many levels.  **Some spoilers ahead**,  First off Paralax is not a former Guardian, it is the first being to feel fear in the Universe.  Paralax is more like a powerful spirit, not a space octupus.  When it is seen, it looks like a yellow bug, a fearsome yellow bug.  The Guardian's would never in a billion years turn to the power of fear, and never make a ring to channel it.  Also why would there even be a Yellow Power battery?  The Guardians would not make such a thing.  Ryan Reynalds sucked as Hal Jordan, stick to stupid comedies Ryan, your no superhero.  Also your Deadpool sucked.  Blake Lively is a terrible actress as well.  Michael Clark Duncan was the wrong voice for Kilawog.  Mark Strong was wrong for Sinestro.  Sinestro should look more like Lee Van Cleef...<br /><br />The Green Lantern's powers were imagined wrong in the movie.  No auras envelope their bodies like in the comics or tv.  The power rings looked all wrong.  The costumes looked like crap also, like they were painted on or something.  Also the power ring's battery looked like something that was half assed at the last minute.<br /><br />Action wise this film was extremely weak.  Even worse than Iron-Man 1.<br /><br />Also Hal \\"defeated\\" Paralax way too easily in the film.  First of all Hal in the comics up until 5 years ago could not defeat Paralax.  I doubt a sun could kill it.  Hal was actually possessed by Paralax and did horrible things before dying.  He became the Spectre for a while...<br /><br />Aliens were rarely seen in the movie, with the rest of the Green Lantern core only seen in glimpses.<br /><br />In conclusion.  Casual viewers did not like this, comic fans or those like me familier with the source material hated it.  Nathan Fillion would have been a great Green Lantern.  But as usual Hollywood opts for pretty boys who suck at acting.  No sequel will be made on this.  I will only buy someday if Amazon is practically giving it away, (because I am a completist, and must own most comic movies), for say 4.99 or less.<br /><br />You have been warned...Watch X-Men: First Class instead., with the rest of the Green Lantern core only seen in glimpses.<br /><br />In conclusion.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I had planned to read it someday but it wasn't at the top of my current reading list.  After moving it up to the top, I was glad I did. I found it took me back to my youth when my father was working as an engineer and often traveling to Sunnyvale as part of his work.  Apple had always seemed like some abstract idea to me.  They make good products, they have great stores, etc., and reading this book was enlightening.  I enjoyed reading that so many things in Steve Job's life influenced his decisions, large and small.  It reminded me that my father had brought one of the new  Mac's home and expressed an intense excitement about this new computer.  As we lost my father to cancer, I also wondered about Steve Job's own battle.  He faced his challenge, and we may yet all gain benefit.  He was fortunate to be accepted and loved and held up by those around him.  This book reminds us we are all human and imperfect, even those who we would try to idolize.  This biography was compassionate, yet direct and honest, like having a conversation with Jobs himself.  --Valerie Randall
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen's new CD is superb: from his haunting deep voice, music, accompanying vocals, to his surprising drawings. Cohen's lyrics of despair & his singing prove once again that he is a rare troubadour of our times. This CD should especially delight old fans. Looking forward to the next CD!

B006ZNRD06|1.0|I'm still looking for a decent video player to play video files I've created on my Kindle Fire.  This one at least opened the .wmv file (but wouldn't open or even recognize a .wlmp file).  But this one, though it opened the file, was glitchy from the start, and the audio was out of sync and hesitating through the playback, and skipping, along with the video.  It's annoying that this app is promoted as free, rather than what it is, a free trial.  I downloaded it, played with it for about two minutes, and then uninstalled.  Why can we not have a good, free, multiple video format player like VLC for the Kindle Fire?
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is the movie that should have been made years ago when the first X-Men movie came out.  Don't get me wrong, I like the first X-Men movie, but now that I've seen First Class...it doesn't measure up like it used to.<br /><br />Just rewatched this on Cinemax so it's still fresh in my mind.  Where to start...?  **Minor spoilers ahead**<br /><br />Actor wise the cast is almost flawless.  Michael Fassbender IS a younger Magneto.  James Mcavoy IS a young Professor X.  Both are superb actors and really put themselves into these roles; something many actors in comic book movies fail to do.  I'm talking to you Ryan Reynalds and Jessica Alba!!!<br /><br />Did I forget to mention the great Kevin Bacon is in this movie!!!  You show me someone who hates Kevin Bacon and I will show you an idiot.  That man is an American treasure and I was glad to see him as the villian.  He did a superb job.<br /><br />This film really delves into why Magneto is the way he is.  After watching this movie I was almost completely behind him in his convictions.  The poor guy was rounded up by Nazi's, held in a concentration camp, mom and dad killed, he was experimented on and witnessed almost all his people illimenated threw genecide.  Yeah he's dark, and it's no wonder.<br /><br />We even get a 7 second cameo of none other than Wolverine.  He has only one line, but what a line!!!<br /><br />This movie has a wide array of mutants also; takes a cool twist on the Cuban Missle Crisis, and is a great foundation for more films to come.<br /><br />Comic  book fans were happy, (we're hard to please, so take our acceptance of this movie very seriously), and casual movie viewers loved it as well.<br /><br />Skip the awful Green Lantern movie and watch this masterpiece instead.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I was worried about the appearance of the digital copy so I returned it before using it.  It looks as if someone had taken the original and inserted a copy with a hand written title.  Not to worry.  It is suppose to look as if Lisbeth Salander burned a copy for you.  and,,, I was not the first to return it so I did not feel too bad about that.<br /><br />I love both versions, Swedish and American but the way this one is filmed, it is so cold, hard and uncomfortable that it suits the story much more than the colors used in the Swedish version.  The performances in this film are first rate.

159448385X|5.0|I knew that, after reading The Kite Runner, the next book I read would pale in comparison.  I was so wrong; A Thousand Splendid Suns far surpassed my expectations.  These books are such important reads for anyone who knows little about Afghanistan or anyone who wants to know more.  After reading, I'm so thirsty for more knowledge about this country that I thought I understood.  Both books were impossible to put down, and I found myself thinking of the characters and longing to know more between reads.  Beautifully written with passion and such a deep understanding of all the nuances and complexities that make the individuals of Afghanistan who they are.  Thank you, Hosseini, for another masterpiece.
1612130283|2.0|I truly tried to enjoy this book but after being a Karen Marie Moning fan for years I thought Christian was a stale Alpha male. Now Jericho Barrons is a man that can make a women's blood boil. But back to Fifty shades of grey and it predictable plots and tame sex scenes. This author wants to give to the reader a sense of how electric Christian and Anastasia chemistry is but it just falls flat. The only reason that this story is getting so much attention is because of the S&M parts which is few. Take out that element and the story really is a dud!

0545101425|3.0|I loved the first book, The Hunger Games!  I really liked the second book, Catching Fire.  This third and final fizzled out for me.  A little heavy on the drama.  The heroine & hero are not so much.  More like a tragedy.  And the narrator is not very good at the boy/men character voices.  Makes Peeta sound like Rudolph the red nosed reindeer; the part where he had the fake nose and sounded like he had a nose cold!  She did a great job on the female characters, however.

0006486118|3.0|The first three books are all classics, the fourth book was boring and this one seems to be in the middle. The negative, bad and angry reviews on here are pretty funny to me but I dont think ADWD was downright awful as many people do. I have no problem with the \\"big cliff-hanger\\" and the minor POV characters, for the most point, were interesting.  Dany's story has been dragging and the amount of dead characters coming back is kinda comical but I still found myself engaged and excited to keep reading.<br /><br />The 2nd half of ADWD picked up and I cant wait to see what happens next. Please get out of Mereen though.<br /><br />7/10.

B007LB1O3I|4.0|Braden put it correctly in his review when he said that for every person who blindly hates Madonna, there's at least 10 people who blindly love her. Thanks to Lady Gaga, the hype round Madonna has sort of died down a bit and The new album from Madonna is here to listen to when we need a bit of a consolation from Gaga's attention whoring. I don't hate Gaga, but she kinda needs to... go away for a bit, lay low for a little while and then come back with a new single. Maybe that's why Born This Way sucked?<br /><br />I hated Madonna's previous record Hard Candy. It was instantly forgettable and only two tracks stuck out to me (Heartbeat, Miles Away). I knew it would sort of fail in comparison to her fantastic Confessions album. It just felt like an excuse to pimp out Kanye, JT and Timbaland. The last track in particular was a let down and had embarrassing lyrics (\\"Are you walking the dog or is the dog walking you\\"). So in that regard I was hesitant to even touch MDNA, and to mu surprise I ended up enjoying it.<br /><br />TRACKS I LOVE:<br />Girl Gone Wild<br />Falling Free (the real hit of the album for me)<br />Addicted<br />I'm A Sinner<br /><br />VERY GOOD TRACKS:<br />Turn up the Radio<br />Love Spent<br />Superstar<br />Masterpiece<br /><br />TRACKS IM NOT BIG ON<br />Some Girls (too much autotune)<br />I Don't Give a<br />Gang Bang (I like that she tried to do something darker but it just came off as desperate, plus it seemed so out of place)<br />Give Me All Your Luvin (sounds like if Open Your Heart was written by a 14 year old)<br /><br />Overall it's not an amazing album but it's one hell of a good one. Better than Hard Candy and it's worth your money too.

Also I'm not a big fan of the pull string because she's always getting it wrapped around her leg. All in all I think I'll cut the string off and it can be a toy phone instead of a pull along toy.

B000Y9Q59W|4.0|It must be interesting to work in the financial world, but it's certainly not a topic that attracts the attention of most moviegoers. Whenever we see stockbrokers depicted on the screen, it appears to be utter chaos. Screens show numbers, people shout and make frantic phone calls, and we discern from their reactions whether they made money or not.<br /><br />Wall Street overcomes some of the limitations of the subject matter by giving us well-acted characters that we care about. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) begins the story as a struggling broker who hopes to one day make a phone call that will change his life. Most of his potential clients aren't in a position to do that, but one is.<br /><br />Gordon Gekko (Douglas) doesn't waste a second of his time when he's working, and he's usually working. After calling for 59 days straight, Bud delivers a box of Cuban cigars on Gekko's birthday and is given five minutes to convince him that he can help the man make money. He doesn't really hold Gekko's attention, but uses a desperate ploy before he is thrown out. Bud's father, Carl (Martin Sheen), works for Bluestar Airlines and has given Bud information about the company which will result in the price of the stock rising. Gekko decides to take a chance and Bud is hired.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear to Gekko that Bud had inside information. He tells him that he doesn't like to lose and he'll need similar information in the future if he's to keep him around. Bud has a decision to make. Does he try to work ethically and within the law, or take a chance and do what Gekko asks? This is a story of greed and corruption and we see Bud take the latter option. He follows around another investor in an attempt to find out what company the man might be trying to buy. The information is useful to Gekko and he makes a fortune.<br /><br />Bud's life will never be the same. He's finally on a path that will result in him becoming a major player. He begins spending money on a new apartment and artwork which reflects his success. He also starts a relationship with a woman who would normally have been beyond his reach. We see what money and success can do to a person. Previous relationships are harmed or completely abandoned. His father is an ethical man and is particularly hurt by Bud's actions. Despite warnings from some of his colleagues, Bud ruthlessly pursues success.<br /><br />Will Bud achieve his dream and stay one step ahead of the law? Can he continue to provide Gekko with enough relevant information? Will he prove his father and work colleagues wrong?<br /><br />Charlie Sheen is convincing as Bud, but the real highlight of the film is the Oscar-winning performance from Michael Douglas. He exudes power and gives the impression that he doesn't tolerate failure in any form. He's a brilliant public speaker and easily wins the support of companies he's taking over, even if he means to destroy them.<br /><br />It's very strange seeing images of the twin towers in older films and it's a little sobering to see them here. There are a few other things which date the film and the funniest change has to be the differences in technology. Take a look at the computer screens without laughing or at cell phones the size of a brick.<br /><br />I always take note when a film holds my interest with subject matter that I usually find boring. Wall Street is one such film and it's a gripping drama.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is disappointing to say the least.

1606865617|5.0|I am amazed at the negative reviews of this book - especially those that said it was hard to follow. While there is time shifting, it is not confusing. Rather, it is a tantalizing peek at future events that continue to unfold as you read. Her prose is lovely and creative and the social commentary is devastating. This book - like most good books - requires the reader to think, to put some effort into the process. Perhaps that was a problem for those readers who found it unappealing.

1934030597|5.0|I am a newbie when it comes to bicycle repair and maintenance. This book helped a lot with some of the basic repair I needed to do on my bike.  It shows all the tools needed and what to use them on.  It explains the different kinds of maintenance you can do and also what you shouldn't do.  The author wrote this for us newbies and also those experienced at the same time.  It was very detailed and yet not too over my head.  I am so glad I got this book.
0439023513|2.0|I'm going to start my review much like the other reviewers by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments in this series. The Hunger Games kept me wanting more and Catching Fire, though I was slightly disappointed in its ending, was full of intrigue as well. One of the major components that kept my attention was the relationship between Peeta and Katniss. The love triangle felt oddly familiar (Twilight) but in this series I remained strongly loyal to Peeta.<br /><br />**Possible Spoiler Alerts**<br /><br />This brings me to how I feel about Mockingjay. I was really hoping for an awesome climax to Peeta and Katniss's relationship. The kissing scenes in the other books were descriptive and left you feeling like you were the one kissing a crush for the first time. Mockingjay took all of that a threw it away leaving you with a big dud at the end. I ended up being really confused and annoyed with the entire book with all of its back and forth...who do you trust?...crap. Plus, contrary to the first two books I ended up disliking Katniss and felt that she didn't deserve either Peeta or Gale. She pretty much transformed into this indifferent, self-preserving, empty shell of a person who, not only drove herself crazy, but drove everyone else crazy too. Her defiance became annoying instead of endearing.<br /><br />I can't give any technical opinions on the underlying theme and the way the book was written but I do agree with other reviewers that the ending (and possibly this entire book) was rushed and felt completely different from the other two. I read a review that said something along the lines of we all know war is terrible but that's why there are fiction books, so we can get away from the reality of the already awful things that are happening around us. I understand why the war in Panem was such a large part of the book but instead of ending it with an emptiness that is depressing and removing all of the relationships that kept readers locked into the story --those stolen kisses, or short moments of affection-- it ends up just being a war story. I don't agree that everyone expected a fairy tail happily ever after but the ending was incomplete.<br /><br />I could possibly go on forever because I have about 10 other things I'd like to elaborate on but I'm going to close with saying that I am disappointed in the book - left wondering how in the hell they are going to translate into movies that kids can watch - and wishing that there was some alternative to this trilogy.tory --those stolen kisses, or short moments of affection-- it ends up just being a war story.

0307949486|4.0|I made the mistake of watching the movie 1st, thinking the book would have more to it than what they can put into film.  Wrong.  The movie is just like the book and pretty much made for a boring read.  But, if I hadn't watched the movie, this book is stellar.  The sexual sadism is kind of strange and I don't understand why it is was made to be such a large part of the story, but it can be ignored.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have created another classic compilation of music.  This album is full of great songs that will become classics.  I've also seen them in concert since receiving the CD and they played alot of the songs on this CD and they sounded great in person as well.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|First, the production is top shelf. It's so pleasant to have camera shots that last long enough to enjoy. Best video/audio quality I've seen and heard. Right up there with and somewhat better than TOTO's \\"Falling in Line\\". It's noticeable how much better Joe's phrasing has become with experience and how his musical counterparts blend with him. It's amazing how clean his playing is yet has all the feel of a journeyed guitarist.<br /><br />Song set is good, much different than the RAH show. My favorites are still his standbys like \\"Dust Bowl\\" and \\"Mountain Time\\". The guest slots are good although I'm not impressed with Beth Hart. A lot of her time on stage was spent just moving around without singing. I can't help but think how well Susan Tedeschi's voice and playing would be a better fit.<br /><br />Solid drumming but hey, lose the scowl. Sorry but I'd rather see Jason Bonham on skins. Heavier feel. Pay attention to Carmine's bass playing. I can't think of anyone else who would compliment Joe better.<br /><br />A wonderful tribute to Gary Moore with \\"Midnight Blues\\". Listen to Gary and the Midnight Blues Band playing at the Montreaux Festival a few years ago. His version of \\"Midnight Blues\\" will melt you.<br /><br />Hopefully Joe might find time to tour with Black Country Communion again. An awesome show and dvd too!!!
B006P0FIGU|5.0|Past Musketeer movies have been maybe okay-not bad overall, but this one actually kinda surprised me.  I was going into it expecting something \\"okay\\" like The Musketeer, but this one I thought was actually pretty cool.  It's kind of a newer more refreshing take on the 3 Musketeers, and the action in this one was enjoyable.  Most of the acting overall was pretty good (one of the musketeer guy's performances was so so, but not so much so that it would cause me to mark this movie down any over it).  I was surprised to see an arrogant, flamboyant Orlando Bloom in this movie too...I hadn't even realized he was in this.  Logan Lerman is pretty cool, and Milla Jovovich, Christopher Watlz, and Ray Stevenson are always cool.  I wasn't all that familiar with the actors playing the other 2 musketeers, but admitedly they weren't too bad, spare a slight bit of shortcoming by one of them in the acting department.  There was one scene that seemed like it could have been shot a little better, when Milla was running through a booby trapped hall in the beginning.  I don't know how best to describe it, just watch it for yourself, but something seemed a little \\"fake\\" about it maybe.  None the less, the movie on a whole is pretty good and quite entertaining...do check it out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There's so many reviews for this book, and I just to say how much I enjoyed it. I'm going to get two others and keep myself busy reading. Thank you Ms. Collins!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In the beggining before I had read the Hunger Games i`d seen other kids read these books so i decided what the heck I will read it. In this book Katniss fights to the death to save her life.  Suzzane Collins has done the perfect job constucting the perfect novel for both kids and adults. She combines real life problems and incorparates them into the book its a must read.<br /><br />Contact me at matthew.biggs.14@gmail.com

B005LAIH3G|5.0|In 1977, I wandered into my local comic book store and started seeing displays and photos for Star Wars (episode IV).  Looking at the photos, I thought that it looked like a cheaply made B movie.  Little did I know that within a couple of months, I'd be seeing it for the first of 7 times in theatres.<br /><br />Obviously many years have gone by since then and I've seen a lot of action and sci-fi movies in those years.  Many of them have been great landmark films and I have them in my DVD film library.  But in all those years, I never once came across another movie I wanted to see multiple times in its first run.  I have now seen John Carter 7 times and like many others, I've already pre-ordered this movie ... one copy for myself and one copy for my best friend who has not been able to see the movie in theatres due to her schedule.<br /><br />Its hard to know how to proceed with a review of John Carter since I'm so emotionally invested in it.  Expectations have a lot to do with a movie and its possible to oversell a movie with such superlatives that no movie can possibly live up to it.  But dang it!  John Carter IS an epic! It is of course based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' first novel, before he created Tarzan and George Lucas has said that if there had been no John Carter of Mars, there would have been no Star Wars.  Indeed, had there been no John Carter, it is doubtful whether there would have been an Avatar, a Superman, a Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.  No Cowboys Vs. Aliens.  No Star Trek.  And its true that you will see a lot of familiar things in this movie, but John Carter did them all first and maybe even better!<br /><br /> From the moment it started I was hooked!  And along the way, I laughed at Woola, the Martian \\"watchdog\\" who travels at amazing speeds and is incredibly loyal to John Carter.  I fell in love with Dejah Thoris, played by the lovely Lynn Collins.  I sat on the edge of my seat in the action sequences and drank in the meaty epic story.  And I cried, yes, CRIED during a number of scenes in this lush sci-fi fantasy romance!  I highly recommend that you buy this movie.  It is destined to be a sleeper hit and to gain a larger and larger audience as more people learn that you can't trust jaded critics.  ;)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It's very addictive; I have been playing this game nearly every day since downloading it. But it's also very enjoyable.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I respond to hype involving movies in a variety of different ways. If I get all excited about a film months before its release, I often find myself being disappointed with the film's final product. I saw a trailer for \\"The Artist\\" months back, and didn't think much of it, because I didn't know much about it. I had seen reviews and award acclaim for Michel Hazanavicius's \\"The Artist\\", and wanted to give it a shot. On account of the limited theatrical release that the film got, I found myself venturing toward the bad part of town the night before it happened to win the Golden Globe for best picture, and oh, was it worth it.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is everything you could possibly want it to be. The story isn't anything revolutionary or surprising, but it really doesn't have to be. In case you have somehow not heard of this film yet, it is a silent film that is set in 1927, at the height of the silent movie era. It follows George Valentin, an actor who has had a great deal of success in silent film. The film follows the years where the film industry is moving into \\"talkies\\", where he finds his success is dwindling. He falls hard for Peppy Miller, an actress who is just breaking into the business. This story lasts over the span of maybe ten years.<br /><br />While up until now, Hollywood has widely forgotten about the silent film era, the style of the film feels kind of experimental to a moviegoer of my generation. The film is a beautiful love letter to this period of film which we all have forgotten about. It makes me think that actors, writers, directors...everybody had to work a lot harder in that generation. It's hard to write a universally appealing story with no dialogue.<br /><br />Style is a big deal, camera angles, and lighting are critical. I'm glad this one was released after I took my first Film Studies course at college, because there's a good chance a film like this would have slipped through my fingers otherwise. I learned about the silent film era, and found that there were twice as many flops as there were hits, in those days. This film could not have worked in those days, since it is clearly about the silent film era. However, I appreciate the little hidden history lesson that this film offered.<br /><br />In a film with no dialogue, actors have to have very expressive faces, they have to be able to emote, which is also something that a wide amount of today's actors and actresses have forgotten how to do. Jean Dujardin's George Valentin is wonderful. His infectious smile is a big reason why the film works. It's the same deal with Berenice Bejo. The two actors have phenomenal chemistry, and that's enough to carry this, even if it were a bad film.<br /><br />Like I said, this film's storyline is nothing new. It's the classic story of the Hollywood big cheese who helps the beautiful young starlet in her rise to fame. The film works because it's a story that can be shown in any country, in any language, and it would still be relevant. It's universal in a way that I didn't expect. The film doesn't use the titles that silent films are known for too much. There are titles, but they are used sparingly, only when they need it. That was a very good thing. For a film that's so strictly about filmmaking technique, being shot in glorious black and white, with a 4x3 aspect ratio, it's quite affecting. I give most of the credit to the actors, the extraordinary musical score by Ludovic Bource, and the direction. This was clearly a labor of love, and it pays off in a big way.<br /><br />Grade: A
0374275637|1.0|Like many others looking forward to the publication of this book, I was expecting what the early reviews promised, ie. real insight in how the brain works from an intellectual leader. Unfortunately I was disappointed at all fronts, this books is in fact a hodgepodge of fragmented information and anecdotes that do not make a story, and even worse, most of it has been covered very extensively in various popular articles and publications. The author is also misguided in attempting to write for the general reader, he simply does not have the knack to do this, and his attempt compromises the correctness and clarity of the presentation. This is _not_ a book that is useful for \\"by the water coller\\" discussions as the author proclaims, and neither is it a book providing useful insight for a more technical reader.<br /><br />If this was all, it would simply be a missed opportunity and I would hardly be inclined to write a review about this. Unfortunately the book includes a surprising amount of erroneous claims, especially those related to mathematical concepts. More or less, the author claims that maths can tell is a lot about describing human choices, but his mathematical errors are so frequent and so basic that I do not have any confidence in his claims. I will pick one from page 181-182 which is so elementary that is enough to cast shadow on every other statement. On these pages, the author presents two claims which he states are mathematically equivalent. Putting aside the act that both can be interpreted in different ways, and so they do not actually represent well defined mathematical concepts, they are trivially not equivalent -- the one is a corollary of the other that is, one is contained in the other and thus the latter is wider than the former.<br /><br />There are numerous such examples littering the book. However, at a more fundamental level, the author seem to have a complete lack of understanding of causality and statistics. In fact, he seems to actually claim in many places that observing correlation implies causality, one of the greater errors a scientist can fall into. Moreover, he seems to have no appreciation for the limitations of statistical descriptions -- this might be a minor concern for many, but there are real philosophical differences between a deterministic and a random view of the world, and the authors does not seem to be able to appreciate the differences.<br /><br />For someone who has made his name on statistics these are all extremely unsettling issues and seem to indicate a very mechanistic approach which has nothing to do with deeper understanding or indeed be compatible with what I understand as the scientific process. Note that these problem is not one to lead to a great scientific debate, but rather indicate poor standards.<br /><br />Finally, the author keeps referring to \\"his nobel\\" so frequently in this book which is simply annoying. Yes, we all know he is a Nobelist and yes, this is why we buy the book --  and in fact it says so with big letters on the cover. The author simply has to live up to this standard, not remind us what the standard is. One is tempted to believe that he intentionally does this to cover up the severe limitations of the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I love the ending! I really enjoyed the book because it had so much action. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen everytime I picked up the book.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety, although some games are really just repeats of earlier games. some controls are better than others. The &quot;free &quot; points NEVER works which is kind of a disappointment, but it doesn't take that long to get good points, at least, so far.
1451673442|5.0|I liked this book as much as I liked \\"The Secret\\".  Easy to read and follow instructions and very illuminating if you believe in this kind of thing.  I can honestly say that I have succeeded in a couple of her methods.  I would recommend it to anyone in the spiritual path.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|great alarm, after reading negative reviews i dont see many that are even valid.<br />1. i have the epic 4g it doesnt really drain my battery.<br />2. it does have volume control, i set every alarm to 100% without using the crescendo effect which takes it from low to high.<br />3. you can adjust the snooze time.<br />4. ads clicks are placed next to the alarm turn off button (disable) but what do expect its free!<br />All in all its a great alarm you can customize the tone for each one and set different amounts of snoozes according to you preference. 110 times better than the stock alarm. Like any good alarm it will wake up a turned off phone and sound when scheduled with sound, even if set to vibrate!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm watching this series on my Sony Bravia Internet ready TV and Kindle Fire. Unlike Netflicks, Amazon has gotten it right. The series is fantastic with a stellar cast moving the viewer from class society prior to WWI to the changes the war wrought. Doesn't get any better.
