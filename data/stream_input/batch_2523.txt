B006P96PAO|5.0|We loved this movie, family friendly. How to make the right decisions even when faced with great peer pressure! We plan on watching this again and we high recommend to friends and family. Ron and Linda
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Buy on ur own risk! I PROMISE U THIS GAME IS FUN AT 1st BUT THEN IT IS VERY BORRING!!!<br /><br />&lt;3<br />  Rheana R.
B006FK7SZ4|4.0|i just wish more was free but good app. we need to get more local people too but there already is alot but the more the better
B00338QENI|4.0|I didn't know anything about about this until reading this book and it is a very interesting story.  I didn't particularly like the ending and agree with some others that it may have gone on too long. Still its a good book and a great story that beckons the question,  would you put individual people first or do you believe that science and  gaining knowledge is worth anything regardless of people? Some interesting discussions can come out of this book and I think it would be great for a book club.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|Very heart warming loved it will definitely a movie to watched over and over again hope there is more to come just like it
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nothing succeeds like deception, and this is what Gone Girl is all about. Sick, perverse, and compelling all at the same time.
0425180638|5.0|The Last Precinct is filled with intrigue, mystery, medical technology, medical mystery and complicated characters brillantly described and absolutely fascinating! You will not be able to put it down. Patricia Cornwell is a brillant writer and you will be able to smell the smells that she describes. You will be able to see the scenes that she describes. You will laugh at some of the deliberate descriptions of the characters that you will recognize in your own back yard. You will laugh, cry, get annoyed, cringe, puzzle, wonder and above all actually learn something new.<br /><br />I started at the beginning with Postmortem and have read my way up. Each novel stands alone but it is a much better journey if you read it in order. You will be able to follow each and every character that is described in considerable detail. I also went back and bought the audio books to read along with the books. The narrators bring it to vivid life! The great benefit to the audio books is that you can listen to the book while you do your housework or drive.<br /><br />Move over CSI, Criminal Minds and NCIS because you won't be able to put it down for one minute.<br /><br />If I could give it more than a \\"5\\" I would!
B006M4F67A|5.0|The game that never gets old and makes me feel young again, back to the days of memory. Then there are those tiles that match and you have to sit back and say, WTF?? How does that match? I've just wasted ten minutes staring at this screen and you tell me that those two tiles match?? Fun
B00B81B0HC|3.0|only a few of the songs really had me singing along and into the music.  The rest were just there.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|It was free, my favorite price. its like galaga on crack. I would always play galaga one way, double ships or no ships, if I had a single ship I was about as useful as a potato gun in Afghanistan
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I have bought this CD for several of my friends who are new moms. The storytelling is wonderful, but above all, Merchant explores such a wide variety of musical genres. I think it provides a wonderful opportunity for children (and adults) to be swept away on a musical journey through different times and cultures. It truly transports you and allows your imagination to wonder.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is still one of the best Star Trek movies.  I really liked how they used an old episode of the Original Star Trek and went further with the story.  I think if you are going to see the new Star Trek Into Darkness, watch this first, as you will get a better apprieation of Into Darkness.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I liked this one the most because for the first time we really get to know Harry Bosch.  This one is much more personal than the others, and I enjoyed the insights into his intense behavior.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I was unable to watch it on TV, so, fortunately, Amazon had it and I was able to keep up with this show, which by the way, is one incredible series. Very few NCIS shows rate a four star, the rest are five's.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I just finished this book and I feel downcast, maybe even disillusioned about life.  I loved the writing.  I hate the subject matter and the truth it represents.<br /><br />This is a well-written dark thriller.  The void that it left me with, as a reader, is similar to the void that The Great Gatsby left.  Kind of a forced swallow of certain realities in life.<br /><br />If reading is a form of escape for you, I advice against reading this book.  But if you love good writing and gritty realistic literature, then this comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts through the comments - if you happen to read this book sometime after this review is posted.  (I say this cause a whole lot of the public out there has probably already read this book way before I did.)
B00BF11STU|5.0|A fabulous-ly interesting movie about how THE CIA works for us to get the bad guys!! You will never forget this picture//some torture is always required to get the truth from these ugly bastards.<br /><br />signed/ Mr. Davis/Investment Banking M & A
B000001C6M|5.0|Slayer launched an assault on the metal world by combining the intricate structures of NWOBHM with the sheer intensity of hardcore punk, resulting in a style of music that was mythological like metal but confrontational like punk. The consequence of this unholy meetup was Show No Mercy, which demonstrates Slayer's classic angular riff technique alongside chord progressions from Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Angel Witch played at the breakneck tempos and shredding speeds of a GBH, Discharge or Exploited album. Add into this chaotic solos, growling vocals, and a propensity to describe the world through a symbolic landscape of occultism and metaphysics, and a new form of music was born. From this nexus flowed the next evolution of speed metal, and much of the technique to death metal as well. Outside of its style, this album endures for its ability to make songs that sound exactly like the emotions they describe, a vertiginous ride through a world that has suddenly become more exciting as it takes on mythology and epic confrontation as a means of explaining the everyday. It's rare to find so much pure power in a band's discography, much less on a single disc, but Slayer concentrated it here and created a legendary offering that still sounds fresh and threatening today.
B003U53GK8|3.0|Seeking cloture, we watched it. Only reason to stick with it was the time invested in seasons 1-5. Random ramblings of plot and people made it difficult to follow.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|You and any little one would enjoy the game. It is challenging for adults and fun for kids of all ages. You and your child<br />if you have one will get a kick out of the graphics and cute little friendly faces they like to watch on the big screen.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game kept me busy for hours...graphics looked great on my kindle. I'm looking forward to the next one; I assume there's a sequel.
193700788X|5.0|I  read all the books in this series and thought the final book had a plausible ending.Keeping in mind the personalities of the characters as they've developed over the series and how humans come and go in vampire lives,I actually saw no other outcome.It made perfect sense to me.Also,there was enough mystery to keep me turning pages.The books would never be called great literature,but they are great entertainment.I enjoyed this as much as the others and a lot more than the TV version.I also think things were left in a way that the characters could be revisited in the future,maybe in short stories.Though I do know she is putting out some kind of character follow-up in the Fall.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I choose this rating.  for me it is very nice, and He loves chronograph watches. And I will be recommending  this product to Braulio Muñoz Correa and his family.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Mr. Ryan was able to bring me into his story very quickly. I loved every second I spent reading this fabulous book!  I will go very far out of my way to read anything he writes in the future.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book! HBO series follows book very well... Can't wait to read 2nd book. Even though book is extremely, it's well worth the read.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It felt like a rushed finish rather than a completion.  Still an enjoyable read.  I am sad there will be no more Sookie novels to read but there are a lot of other writers so I am sure I will find something
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game for adults and kids alike, you get to see Nemo and friends while learning fun facts about the ocean. The only problem I see is that the pants and coral do not produce enough money and the green algae fast enough. So I have a lot of down time before I can plant more coral and living plants. Other than that I love the game!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I was a late-comer FOB fan.  I actually didn't get into them until \\"the hiatus\\" was in effect.  I started with Folie A Deux and quickly went back to the previous three albums.  Now, back 7-10 years ago, I was one of those anxious indie snobs who dismissed the band out of hand for no good reason... yep, I'm not proud of that.  But I've learned.  And \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" is the first FOB album I've gotten to be excited about in anticipation.  I loved \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\\" immediately and once the album came out, I found everything on it to be pretty darn good, and it's only grown more on me since.  Seriously, this album is the perfect comeback for the band.  It's awesome, it's current, it's vibrant and catchy.  I love it.  I think it's their best overall, easily, and that's not to disparage anything that came before.<br /><br />I just saw the band live, too, and they are really excelling right now.<br /><br />FOB are also good at testing me on my biases... and here they bring in 2 figures who I readily despise: Elton John and Courtney Love.  Now, the Courtney thing probably is one of the weaker elements of the album... but Elton John?!?  Man, do I hate his music.  But here he is, and... the song they've done with him is awesome.  A perfect closer.  Great in concert.  Total Fall Out Boy.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Young Volcanoes,\\" \\"Alone Together,\\" \\"The Phoenix,\\" \\"My Songs Know...\\", \\"Save Rock and Roll,\\" and well most of the record.<br /><br />Album of the year?  Maybe... but who cares about rankings?  Enjoy it.<br /><br />Haters?  Enjoy your hate if that's your thing.  But, if you wanna learn from me, it's better to grow out of it.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great show, too bad it was cancelled, but at least they followed up with movie :). I think what made it great was the cast, even though most of them were unknown at the time, they all had great chemistry.
B0089LOG02|5.0|When I saw this book advertised I knew I would enjoy it. I didn't just enjoy it i loved it. I felt like I was back in time riding the train and experiencing everything Vivian went through. It was difficult to read through my tears. Some sad and some happy. I love books about history. I had heard about the orphan train but never read anything about it.  I would have loved to read a sequel to see what happens to Molly and Jack.  This book is easy to read.  I couldn't put it down.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|My kids love it - but it doesn't seem to have much action and it's not obvious how to set up a reef for each kid individually.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Reminds me of the great shooters of yesteryear, such as Soldier Blade.<br /><br />Very slick controls, and I'd recommend this game as a modern staple of the genre.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The kids love the fact that they get to build something and it seems to be good for multiple ages.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I have seen the movie several times....love, love, love it!  Reading the story after seeing the movie helps 'fill in' what the movie leaves out. This story, in my oponion, is a classic!
B008XG1X18|5.0|THIS HAS INTEREST OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD IT AND POST PICTURES OF THEIR INTERESTING THINGS... I CANT GO INTO IT ALL IN DETAIL, BUT I SUGGEST YOU DOWNLOAD IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought I would be disappointed after all the press and awards...like my it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations.  Surprise!!<br />I was hooked after the first episode!  Love the characters, plots and of course the location!!!  Amazing.  I just finished watching Season 2 and purchased Season 3!!!  I'll be really sorry when I'm caught up and have to watch each episode.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|They always find ways to explore different variations of music style.  That is what keeps a music group current and relevant.
B001QWBM62|5.0|It works great and is very handy. It's practical to be able to have recordings that I can send via email or upload to the internet.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The Good Wife's host of characters are convincing, believably conflicted, and engaging.  The storyline is sometimes predictable and some characters seem to be only shells, for example the children and their friends who despite being woven in and out of the story, have little depth.  The theme of the show is solid and there is not better actress for the job than Julianna Margulies who is beyond talented in her controlled expression of the main characters emotions.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Disappointing!  The last 3 books in this series have been disappointing,but I had read all the other books in this series and loved them so I had to read it to the finish.I feel the series should have ended sooner and was stretched out to make money and thus compromised the quality.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|This was purchased as a gift, so I am not able to provide a personal rating.  The recipient was quite pleased with the item.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I can't even tell you how many times I've seen this movie.  It is just sooo good.  And with the blu-ray upgrade, you can't even tell how old this movie is.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like the game because it will entertain you for hours and it wont consume all or your time! I like the game a lot
B008Y2VTIS|4.0|This show is good, but you have to dig through the nonsense.  don't watch when you are tired or you may fall asleep through it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|We need more games like this.  BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS.<br />The play is engaging and I couldn't put it down!  Well done.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We will never tire of watching it.  Each viewing provides something new and engaging.  I am waiting impatiently for the next incredible chapter!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book.  What a great story of love, hope and tragedy for 2 young people struggling to survive terminal illness.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I find this app fairly satisfying. It works nicely on my regular kindle fire. I like the many, many, many, many smiley faces I can use while chatting with a friend:) I like the computer version of facebook much more than the mobile version and this app is more like the computer version. Although, I have noticed one thing. This app is slower and less responsive than the facebook app that was originally programmed into the kindle. It sometimes has problems loading and sometimes the app doesn't open altogether. All in all, I am satisfied with my new facebook app.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I've had this a long time and never been disappointed. Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD7. I highly recommend this calculator.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|If I could I would give this movie 10 stars.... One of Carreys best, in my opinion... I watched this with my dad for the first time when I was a kid. He taught me I appreciate simple humor and that you didn't have to use profanity, descriptive lewd jokes, or be racist or politically satirical to be funny... This movie has it all in that regard can't stop laughing and wishing more people used this kind of humor still...
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Mr. Archer could do better and has done better.  Not impressed with this one, I thought much of this was a bit dull.
B003G4W49C|1.0|While it doesn't have any direct affect on the story, buyers beware that Orson Scott Card is virulently anti-gay. A sampling:<br /><br />\\"The dark secret of homosexual society--the one that dares not speak its name--is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.\\"<br />- Orson Scott Card - Homosexual \\"Marriage\\" and Civilization
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this.  Although I didn't realize it was the first part of series.  I will be waiting for the rest.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|huge selection of cards, with stunning artwork, and the missions are fun yet challenging. unlike a lot of free games you can enjoy youtself without having to buy any extra stuff.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|I went back and watched this again.  It was really interesting to see the Kahn of old to the newest Kahn of today.  I really enjoyed seeing this again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris has done it again, very nice narrative.  Too bad the Sookie story is over but it was a great adventure.
B001XULSG6|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this again.  I would recommend this to anyone not just trekkies to watch.  Fun for the whole family.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Couldnt get over terrible accents in male lead and undeveloped plot. Very disappointing, I had such high hopes for this movie.  And, no. I didn't read the book.  It's just plain disappointing.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|\\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\" is one of the most unusual, engaging and genuinely moving novels that has come around in a long, long time. Think \\"Shipping News\\" meets \\"Poisonwood Bible,\\" and shaded with Karen Joy Fowler's unique voice and talent, and you have an idea of the literate and storytelling power of this book.<br /><br />There's an inherent dilemma in talking about Fowler's new novel:  it's built around a secret. Or, more accurately, a reveal. And though knowing the twist in advance doesn't diminish the story, it won't be disclosed here: no spoiler alert.<br /><br />On the surface, the novel is about the Cookes of Bloomington, Indiana (where Fowler spent the first 11 years of her life). This unconventional, dysfunctional family consists of a pedantic psychologist father who specializes in animal behavior, an emotionally fragile mother and three children: Lowell, Rosemary and Fern.<br /><br />One daughter mysteriously vanishes, the other changes from a prodigiously talkative child to a silent adult; the brother runs away. And beneath the basic plotline lies a story as fantastic, terrible and beautiful as any Grimm's fairy tale.<br /><br />Reading Fowler's novel is like looking at a photo album as someone else turns the pages, back and forth and often several at a time. The all-too-human Cooke family comes into focus through this fluid, time-tripping technique, unearthing memories and mysteries along the way. Jealousy glitters as a recurring theme, along with fairness, unconditional love, animal rights and the power of language.<br /><br />Rosemary, the relentlessly direct voice of the novel, explains up front that she's starting her story in the middle: it's 1996, and she's a 22-year-old student at the University of California, Davis. Her brother, who disappeared 11 years earlier, is an animal rights activist on the run from the FBI. She hasn't seen her sister Fern in 17 years.<br /><br />We time-shift backwards, witnessing the three siblings' exceptional connection prior to the unraveling of their childhood, then skip decades ahead to solve the sad puzzle of Fern's disappearance. Throughout the book, Fowler's brilliant wordcraft intertwines tragedy and levity in a masterful crazy quilt of innocence, loss, renewal and bittersweet hope.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really, really liked this series, and the ending did not disappoint me. I thought the characters were consistent, the plot became very interesting after book 4-5, and the writing was cute, making it an easy read. Sookie in True Blood is not very interesting to me, but she is so developed in the books. After Twilight ruined vampires for me, it was refreshing to have their images saved in the Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Mysteries. Thanks goes to the author for creating a respectable heroine immersed in such a creative universe.<br /><br />ETA: after reading the reviews here, I just want to say that absolutely none of these books are more than fun mysteries with a great saga running through it. It was Shakespeare an until the last book. If I wanted to criticize any of these books as my college writing professor mom would criticize PARADISE LOST or something, then the entire series does have problems, indeed. Disregarding all the previous problems and shredding the last book over a few only indicates to me that (SPOILER ALERT) other readers were as heartbroken to see the end of Sookie & Eric's relationship as I was. It really hurts to see an epic relatioship build and not get a \\"happily ever after,\\" but it really is consistent with Sookie's integrity.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|After many years watching it anytime I had a chance, finally I decided to buy it.  Great movie, nice warning what humans are trying to do to themselves.  Great graphics comparing to Terminator 1.  It is amazing how much difference 20 years does in movie making.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game to be extremely absorbing and entertaining. The graphics are simply stunning and the game play logical but with enough difficulty to be challenging. My only criticism would be that it was too short. Having said that, I'll be eagerly awaiting any further games of this type from this company.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My son loves it, and he tries to get creative and spell many words he would never try otherwise.  It's a game I really don't mind him playing!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I have two boys under 10 and they both loved the movie - can't wait for D-Me 2 to come out.
0307341577|3.0|I wouldn't recommend this book. I read Sharp Objects. It was great. That's why I chose to read Dark Places.<br />Definitely a downer in which the &#34;surprise conclusion&#34; isn't worth the dreary trip.<br />Flynn is a great author though.
0676974945|1.0|Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell, has a huge theme of reincarnation and starts out in the 19th century all the way to a post-apocalyptic earth.  Six stories are interwoven with one another.<br /><br />I loved the concept of Cloud Atlas telling six different stories that are interwoven with one another and each story taking place in different time periods.  Unfortunately, this book was an epic failure.  One can only hope the movie was better.<br /><br />Check out my full review at:  http://thebookwormrunner.blogspot.com/2013/05/traveling-world-reincarnated.html
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game it challenges me.  Never gets boring.  The tiles are beautifully displayed to show their detail.  This is one game my grandchildren even enjoy.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I like Matt Smith and Amy Pond but its just not the same is David Tennant and Rose Tyler. Sorry Matt.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. Sometimes you have to think outside the box to figure out how to draw something. And I like that you can see the other person's drawing as they are drawing it. Very fun.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|And it's about an hour too long.  The movie definitely would have benefited from some additional time spent in editing.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|I understand that the Ray Charles vein of this disc is lost on some reviewers here, but for those of us who loved Ray's experimentation with a range of genres, this is a stunningly beautiful tribute. Larry Klein's production coupled with Peyroux's brilliant reading of these classics results in a recording that just gets better with repeated listenings. In fact, Peyroux's voice has never sounded more nuanced and fluid. Sadness hasn't sounded this sweet since the great Lady Day, yet Peyroux has now moved past the Billie Holiday pastiche and into her own universe. Can't wait for the next one.
B009K0P10K|5.0|OMG! A coworker told me about Revenge and I decided to try it out. During memorial day weekend, I completed the entire first season and purchased season 2 on Amazon. This series keeps me guessing about what will happen next. I have noticed that my heart rate is always elevated when I am watching the series. I am half way through season 2 but I am getting through it quickly. Great series!!!
B0000029J5|5.0|Twenty years after its release, this disc stands the test of time. Perfectly composed, perfectly performed and perfectly recorded. Keb Mo' gets country blues like no one since the legendary Brownie McGhee. I think his catalog is even more rewarding than the work of Taj Mahal. That said, if you buy only one Keb Mo' record, this is the one to get.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|was a good movie, lots of shooting, and a really great classic Chevelle all hopped up and sounding great.  Not the best plot but still fun to watch and turn up the volume.
B005K17RU0|3.0|You'll get what your looking for weather wise, but to me it seems to not be very user friendly.  My review may be bias.  I utilize a local New's app that I enjoy very much.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Just had to watch the next one.  I dont like not seeing all of something, and this one continues so had to watch it.  They are not bad, and enjoy seeing the werewolves, and the interaction of the vampires and wolves is a little different than anything I have seen so made this doable.  by and large, dont own much chick flick stuff outside of these.
0955153077|4.0|Bought this book with the naive expectation that it would be my sole guide to digital painting. Instead, it teaches some basic ideas with advanced examples.<br /><br />For instance: there is a lesson on lines and perspective and the corresponding image is a very well-done sketch of a street. It didn't exactly help, but it was nice to see what I could achieve with some more study.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|It's VERY good.<br /><br />The music:  It's great.  These guys have come a long way from their self-titled album and 'Desperado'.  You just have to listen to this release to appreciate the expanse of talent they have.<br /><br />The mix:  Depending on what sound system you use, you may have to do some spectrum adjustment.  The base line hits HARD on this release.  Not a mushy, messy mumble you hear from the 'Look At Me' bunch in their wanna-be drift cars;  This is crisp!  I'm an analog man, myself...old school stereo.  My Adcom GFA-555 through an acoustic suspension Polk MM2154 with JBL L19s are a treat with the mix of this CD.<br /><br />...and the MUSIC is GREAT!
B001PO53IO|5.0|The first season of the Clone Wars is probably the roughest, which isn't as bad as it sounds when you consider that it's all uphill from here.<br /><br />Blu-Ray quality is amazing, though a frequent viewer will be able to tell which episodes were early on in the production cycle.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|It's a Pixar Classic. My wife and son love this film. But if you're in the mood for action, it's best to seek out a Bruce Willis film instead.
0394826817|5.0|My grand daughter is almost 3 years old but she already get used to say Please and Thank you Oma(Grandma) to me...I bought this book for her so that she will be Happy to read something she already learned!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon.com!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is a great follow up to Game of Thrones. It keeps my interest and introduces new characters without taking away from the old. GRRM has created an intriguing world.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|Highly recommended!  This is my first time purchasing a Gary Clark Jr.'s work and I am extremely happy with my decision.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book was great blend of classic story telling and technical manual: you get the story behind the battle in Afghanistan and lots of interesting biographical history of being a navy Seal.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Great cd and I choose to give a 5 star.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves this incredible music of Michael Jackson!!
B005LJITS0|3.0|I'm just glad I didn't see it at the movie theatres.  I don't think I would watch it again and I definitely would not buy it.  My 12 year old on the other hand actually liked it and saw it 3 times.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|First of all...how many Kindle Fire devices are there?  I have three different Kindles and this cheap, annoying item doesn't fit any of them. The Kindle Fire is heavy and I just wanted something to keep it from slipping and falling.  I was excited to receive this but it was a waste of time and money.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|We love Star Trek, the stories are interesting and the acting is good.  Its become our favorite show, we watch one show a night during school.
0871404133|5.0|The book requires careful reading because it is densely packed with both facts and theory ranging over many species with which the author has had  long experience.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Haven't gotten very far, yet, but not for lack of trying.  A fun game.  Go fast or go slow.  Simple.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I downloaded this book when I wanted to self-publish my non-fiction book on sales and body language on Amazon.com.  This book walks you through the formatting process step-by-step.  It tells you exactly what you need to do and never left me questioning or feeling like there was something missing. Because of this book's guidance, I was able to correctly format my kindle ebook and cover, and download both to Amazon.com's KDP program without a single glitch.  A must-read for anyone who is planning to self-publish on Amazon!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It's kinda irritating<br />I run out of extra guys too easy<br />My money doesn't last long enough<br />Need more tips
B000LJ9ZWO|3.0|POOR ACTING,TOO PG RATED,TOO SHORT OF A STORY,MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY LOW BUDGET,IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE,I HOPE NO WAS PAID
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Really great book hard to set it down!! The text was kind of weird though, it changed in every chapter
B00CW665VI|5.0|I usually do not do the whole book review thing, but when you randomly decide to start reading a book at 12am and instead of getting some shut eye after an hour or so, you keep reading a book (which means you're going to be completely destroyed at work the next day), it's definitely worth doing a review for. I love reading books like this, hot playboy who maybe a bit too sure of himself, meets girl who is just as confident and sure of herself. I might start rambling a bit because I loved this book so much. There was a comfortable balance between humor and romance. It wasn't too sappy or anything like that. This was a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app = Boss. But there is some problems like one time while I was playing The Farm map I went into a building and fell into the ground into nothing couldn't move or anything I had to quit after that.... other then that great game and I love the sound effects and whispers :) 5/5
B005IS565S|5.0|I had to have this album for my collection. The process was fast and easy to accomplish so why not try it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is so fun and interesting. It gives you the experience of the movie without paying for it sweet.
B008Y7EYSK|4.0|The Woman in Black was a good &#34;lights off&#34; scary movie. It features some genuinely creepy moments, and (mostly) pulls everything together in the end.<br /><br />One thing that got a little old was that Daniel Radcliffe maintains pretty much the same facial expression throughout the entire movie. While originally it works well for him, during the &#34;scary&#34; moments it is not the appropriate expression.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This calendar was worth purchasing as it will replace the need for me to buy a paper version every year. I was looking for a calendar that would allow me to keep up with my husbands odd schedule - 3 days on 3 days off - CalenGoo has that capability and I love how it looks on my Kindle Fire. Love that it syncs up with my Google calendar. A great app, I am very happy with it.<br />Only improvement that I would request is the ability to use different colors for different types of events - work vs. play type of distinction or my event vs. my child's event.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Very good show. Keeps you guessing who was good and bad. Kevin Bacon deserves an emmy award for his role
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Tales of battling kingdoms, dragons, a strange Wall, and a tough-talking dwarf - what's not to like?<br />Count me in for the series!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is the best game out there- I have it on all my mobile devices! Keep up the good work
0060930349|5.0|This book is everything it is cracked up to be.  It provides the facts and the analysis that is sometimes lacking in modern histories that are way to concerned with political correctness to ever pass muster outside anything less than a college classroom.  Many people hate Paul Johnson, but he is without doubt a man who can qualify as a respected social observer of American life.  His views and understanding are melded well as someone who actually loves the United States and its people (which is sadly lacking from many of our domestic historians).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I think the parts from the Mexican War though reconstruction are the best in it.  For an meta-history, this book handles those topics well.  If you don't have the time or inclination to read James McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom, then this shorter segment will give you all you need.<br /><br />I hope parents will keep this book in mind for their children.  Our current state of education in history is such that politically incorrect pap gets lumped in heavy doses.  If you want your children to get a real appreciation for our nation, you only need have them read portions of this book, and they will be set aright.  I like Paul Johnson a lot.  I hope you give this book a chance.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Cannot print from my kindle fire hd-can you tell me what it is I am doing wrong? Your help will be greatly appreciated
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi seems at first a great big adventure,<br />but it's actually much more. It's about being on your own,<br />or maybe not. It's about god, or maybe not.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun app I really pike it funny when the neck brakes very funny would.give five stars.but froze to many times
0425263908|5.0|This book is awesome!!!!! It keeps you on your feet on the story line- if you loved FIfty shades you will definitely love this book!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I think this is a good game but it need more stuff put into it like ramps and other things cause sometimes it get boring to play it and you just want to play another game!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have.played MANY Kindle Fire games searching for that &quot;Myst&quot; experience that I just had not found in the HO/adventure games that are available. Having played the Myst series and many of the old Sierra games like Shivers, I've been searching for a true adventure/puzzle game that fits that genre without all of the hidden object scenes. The Room nailed it! MORE, please!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love it so far. I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship. Keep it up big fish<br /><br />Peggiealfano@aol.com
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it love it love it!  it's one of the best game out there. also the graphics are pretty cool.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I first heard some of these songs on PBS. I am so glad I ordered this. His music  acoustically is great. The band is excellent as well. Connie R
B001NHNG64|2.0|Disappointing. Not up to the usual standards of the  reacher novels. Plot not believable. Motives of bad guys unreal and their violence not connected to anything we know about the characters.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I felt this book was rushed and characters not acting true to the way they acted earlier in the series.<br /><br />I did enjoy the first few books but then things just got out of hand.<br /><br />I am glad I read through to the end and while I am somewhat happy with the ending, I had hoped for something more.
B00BURWSHA|4.0|I bought this because of Doug Aldrich. He sounds great on this cd. I don't like the singer though. The songs are on the weak side. No really memorable tunes vocal wise. Lots of big riffs and some killer solos. I give Dougs playing four stars and the rest of the band a 2. So buy it for the guitar playing not so much for the songs.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This was a well documented movie. I could tell there was a lot of research done to accurately capture some if the issues Limcoln ha to juggle while his time as our president.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Her writing style was like it was at the beginning of the series. I really enjoyed that. I was glad she got back to her roots.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|High scores always show Level 1 unless you view the high scores directly after end of game. Needs a regular exit button.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved this book! I felt like it did a very good job in talking about all the types of love and how you can show each of them.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|What a timely tale!  It is impossible for me as a middle class American to comprehend the day to day life of North Korean citizens, and how they can cope with the political and social realities that are so out of sync with our way of life.  Jun Do, the orphan master's son, in this award winning novel, brought me face to face with the totalitarian government that micromanages every aspect of every day of every citizen.  Can the individual survive with any dignity?  Anyone who reads this book may want to consider following up with &#34;Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lifes in North Korea&#34; by Barbara Demick.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is only one word that properly describes this book- EPIC! I loved the first book, but this one was even better. It was vividly written just like the first book. I felt like I was experiencing everything that Katniss was experiencing. However, it had much more drama than the Hunger Games. There was never a dull moment.  I found myself engrossed in this book because it was so riveting and filled with surprises. If you liked the Hunger Games, you will love Catching Fire.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love google search has always narrowed down my choices to what I am really looking for thus making me very happy.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I haven't read the books.  There are a bunch of times in this movie where I was metaphorically elbowed in the ribs by what must be references to things from the books that kind of pulled me out of the movie a bit .... but I imagine fans of the books weren't.<br /><br />There seemed to be a directness about the dialog that was refreshing - no pulling your hair out at characters not talking to each other.  Tom Cruise did his standard top notch action performance, without the superman stuff of some of his roles - Jack Reacher is a pretty believable character.  Was worth the rental - and would be worth a sequel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book, HATED the ending. I thought Nick would finally serve Amy some justice, but I feel like in the end, Amy still gets to be happy. She deserved to go to jail or die.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD! SO GOOD TO HEAR NEW STUFF FROM JIMI AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS! HE WAS SURELY THE BEST!  A+++ TO ME!
0393080269|5.0|I liked the way the author has delved into many economies in the world both small and developing to developed and emerging economies and was able to put forth the points on emerging economies.<br />It has made me understand the potentially growing economies where my Company can invest.<br />Glimpse of the world economies.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It was just a big coincidence that I happened to pick up this first in the King & Maxwell series. I'm on a David Baldacci kick right now and have been picking up his books at random. I had no idea this was a series even though there's a big red sticker staring at me on the cover!<br /><br />As with all his other stories, this one kept me glued to my seat. It was full of twists and turns and right until the end, I had no idea what was going on. After four of his novels, I should start seeing a pattern but the only pattern I see is that I have no idea what's going on right until the end. That makes them as much fun as the fast moving set pieces.<br /><br />There are plenty of likeable characters and a few that could be good or bad, but as usual, it's hard to tell almost until the very end (that's sort of a pattern also). In this case, there were two characters I couldn't figure until deep into the story and a third that threw me right until the end.<br /><br />The writing was excellent, as usual, with solid third person and no significant if any head-hopping. The narration was crisp and didn't bog down with any excruciating details. The story moved and kept me interested. Couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />A lot of people didn't like the ending. Yeah, maybe it could've been a bit better, but it still ended okay, though there was one part I didn't like but I don't want to reveal it even though out of 300+ reviews, I'm sure someone already did. Still, the story met all my criteria for a great read. Highly recommended.
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|was .hoping for something a little more like the other album this one seems to have more electronics than I wanted. they have some nice beats which is neat
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading it. I literally couldn't put it down. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance novels or science fiction... or even fairy tales.
B004WE01YA|5.0|I loved Beauty and the Beast as a kid, and was so excited to see that not only is it now in HD, but in 3D also. I have compared the blu-ray to the former dvd version, and the blu-ray version is so much clearer and the colors are vibrant and pop out at you. If you have a previous version of this movie, it is definitely time to upgrade and get this blu-ray version.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Heard the interview on NPR.  Here has a wonderful voice, but not quite the voice of experience for these classic songs of love.
B00C1C0WCQ|5.0|The kids enjoyed the movie!  They are on a roll to watch the series. The video quality was clear and we had no viewing issues.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app allows my son to sleep in the hotel without being disturbed  by guests in the halls or by our (parents) movement in the suite.
B000SEI230|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK WONDERFUL STORY IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE ALL HAD THAT KIND OF LOVE AND LIVED A GODLY LIFE JAMIE WAS.  COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN AND I AM NOT A BIG READER.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is so much fun. I play it all the time. Plays great on my kindle fire. Great way to pass the time.
B005QUQP76|2.0|I bought this product 2 months ago, where at first I decided on buying just for the reputation of the mouse, but verifying the functionality I saw the following.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Great Design and comfort,<br />Customizable Buttons,<br />Selectable dpi,<br />Bring weights for a heavier mouse,<br /><br />Const:<br />Limited Macros does not allow macros to the buttons, (just instantiated the mouse buttons).<br />Little information about the software, and firmware is old and outdated.<br />The software sometimes causes the mouse stops responding when I assign the buttons.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Ordered full version after playing through the free version. Good but occasional insensitivity on Kindle screen when battery is running low.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Liked this book, but would have liked it more if I had read it when I was 16 and in high school. Reminds me of Pretty Little Liars.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|I liked the movie, but I did not know there was beautiful Hawaiian music in the background. Enjoy the music.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is a good book no matter what you've seen other people say.<br />I have been wrapped up in Sookie's life for several years now and this is just how it should have ended.<br />I will say, the beginning of the book was a little strange and odd for a Sookie book. I had to look at the cover to make sure I bought the right book but it soon made sense. I liked the story and the ending. I think this is how I always expected the ending to be. Of course, I wish there would be more because I have fallen in love with all the characters but all good things must come to an end. I will miss this series very much. Goodbye Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />Ms. Charlaine Harris, I thank you for writing such a wonderful series. I loved getting to know and loving each character involved. I've been lost in Sookie's world every time I've read a book and that's what an excellent book experience should be like. I can't wait to see what you do next!
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Just got the movie. Picture and sound is well done and impressive for considering how old the film is. Picture was clear and colors were spot on. Audio is clear and the music sound s even better with the 5.1 separation.<br /><br />Will be watching this over and over with the family.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It had been several years since I saw the Star Trek movies, but I got back into the storyline pretty quickly.  It was great.  The videos were great with a crisp, clean picture.  I loved the interviews with the cast/ crew as well.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|This is actually a 5 disc set with 2 movies on each disc except for the original Nightmare, that is on a disc by itself. Video & sound quality is great and really nice to have all the movies together on blu-ray. I also have the DVD box set as well and the only advantage to having the DVD set is you get the 3D scene in Freddy's dead, just like the original release. Unfortunately the blu-ray doesn't have it.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Excellent CD.<br />I purchased this for my Mother who is getting into his new music.<br />She is 50 and I'm 22 and we both love this CD.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Gritty, unpleasant, creative. Abercrombie's world feels like the old west, crossed with Renaissance Europe, crossed with the late Roman Empire.<br />Loved it.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Got the movie when promised. movie was packed good. I do not have to worry about orders being in bad condition.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|the game is fun but not when you acesentally hit the menu button where you have to wait for it to lad out then back in but the game is fun other than that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I believe this story was originally a short story which was made into a full length novel. The first part will have you absolutely hooked. I could not put this book down. Simple read, but an incredible story nonetheless.
1938469003|4.0|Much of the information is repeated both with the same chapter and then again in other chapters. Probably could eliminate &#62;10% of the pages.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I really enjoyed how this story was told. This is the second time I watched it and I'd have to say that it was even better than the first time. And the actors are dead ringers for the real individuals.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I saw the show and felt in Love with it immediately; the performers are amazing the stage and choreography spectacular. And the music is refreshing, the way the have arrange it! I 100% recommend it!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Deepak Chopra takes complex principles and simplifies them in a way that a simple person can understand. If applied they can transform anyone who chooses to change their lives
B007REV4YI|5.0|After seeing the movie on Blue Ray, I saw it @ the movies. I just have to recommended again and again. It is one of the best Bond movies yet.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is one you won't be able to put down, and you'll be sad and desperate for more when you finish.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I hope they make more. I was glad it wasn't just an action movie. I liked the villains backstory. He was awesome.
B0028N729O|3.0|Couldn't relate to the main character and her &#34;issues.&#34;  Other than that, the book was very intriguing...moved fast, easy read.  GOOD PLOT with twists and turns you expect from Gillian Flynn.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Warbreaker was the first book I read by Brandon Sanderson and even after reading several of his other books it remained my favorite, until now. I absolutely love this book. The book centers around four main characters, but is dominated by one of them. Kaladin the former surgeon apprentice, turned spear-men squad leader, turned slave. His story is so compelling that I found it hard not to read through this 1000 page book as fast as I could just to see what would happen to him. The other stories are also quite interesting and I look forward to learning more about the other three mains in later books.<br /><br />Being stuck in bed with a cold was never so enjoyable.<br /><br />I will most likely read through this book again before Words of Radiance comes out November 2013. I am so excited to see where this series goes. If you loved Elantris, Warbreaker, and the Mistborn trilogy you will love this book.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Classic must see but graphic and for adults<br />some of the lines are so classic and easy to remember<br />great at parties with friends
B005LAIGW8|4.0|I did not find the 2nd ghost rider to be nearly as good as the first, but my boys love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and Iove the survival!! The creative is ok too!!! I know it's 7$ but it's worth it! If you don't have it get it NOW!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I recieved my Marware Standing Case and it was just like new, I am so pleased.  I will be checking in on other items from time to time and will recommend this to all my friends. In fact have already started doing so. Thanks so much, Elsie Phipps
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|OK game but I can't change my name........so lilly it is. Don't like the buying stuff with real money, so I hope I don't get a case of fat fingers.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A little slow during Pi's exploration of religions, but overall a really good book. I would recommend for a good read.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Don't get lot of spam mail, also very large storage capacity. Wonderful filtering in place, sufficient. Yahoo doesn't't close your account quickly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I gave this game 5 stars because it is easy to play. The cards are easy to see. I like the set up of the cards.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|The movie is not your typical Hollywood or typical Independent horror movie with bad acting, editing, and music score.<br /><br />This is by far the most liked \\"horror\\" movie that I have watched. The word horror is under quotation since I would not categorized this movie as horror only but under suspense, thriller, and drama. The music score and editing is awesome to say the least. FYI: read my other reviews on the movies that I have watched and you'll understand what I am trying to convey here.<br /><br />So the music score and editing was great. The storyline is great and something refreshing to me unlike the overrated and hyped horror movies out there. The acting is also great and you get those feelings when you look at the actors'/actresses' eyes. The feelings that they are trying to convey. Sure there are CGI scenes and character but it just fits right in there perfectly without affecting the quality of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is not purely horror but more on suspense, thriller, and drama. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The movie is especially dramatic at the end parts. It is kind of sad but at the same time makes you wonder what will happened next.<br /><br />I just don't get it why this movie got a low rating of 3-3.5 Stars overall. And why people are complaining about the ending being \\"crappy\\" and \\"bad\\". This is one of the best movies out in the market right now. Well worth to purchase it either via Prime, like I did, or the physical media.<br /><br />This one has a reserved spot in my physical media video library.
B00CW665VI|1.0|The POV being only from the guy was an interesting change, but he drove me crazy! Every page went like this: \\"You know how __? Yeah, that's___\\" \\"You see__over there?\\" EVERY PAGE. I get what the author was trying to do, like he was talking to you like a friend would in real life, but I just wanted to scream, \\"Yes, I know! Just say it already!\\" I don't know if that makes any sense unless you read the book, but it was annoying.<br />I have to agree with other reviewers, the way Drew treated Kate at the office made me uncomfortable and he seemed like a stalker.<br />\\"I won't stop until you go out with me on Saturday.\\"<br />That's creepy, not romantic.<br />What is with all the guys like this in novels lately? I think authors need to learn the difference between love and obsession.<br />I really didn't see what was so great between Drew and Kate. She was good at her job and sings well? And I don't know what the hell she saw in him.<br />Another little rant: kids who are unrealistic. Mackenzie is nearly four, can't talk correctly, but knows how to add and use a calculator?<br />I would not recommend this book. If you want a book about co workers falling for each other, Julie James' Practice Makes Perfect is good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  I love the music and the acting and the truth of the role individual personalities play within culture.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Gave an interesting insight into where the series started from and let you witness the characters as they developed to their well-known status.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is a great game for me to kill time. if it could save the game status, that would be perfect
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Being an Eric and Sookie fan, after the buildup of the last couple of books, I was very disappointed at the turn it took. The entire book kind of felt out of sync with the series and a bit rushed, like it was in a hurry to just close off all loose endings. But I did enjoy the previous books in the series, although for obvious reasons, book 4 will always remain my favourite
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun to play but I think it's. more fun on the ipad like on the Ilario on. survival games it give you free stuff I hope you like it and get it!!!!!#
B007SGM084|3.0|This book is interesting but very &#34;dark&#34;. We all deal with relationships in different ways. This was a little controlling and could be construed as abusive.
159463176X|3.0|The book started with his known skills of great story telling. A few times it brought tears to my eyes. But the last 200 pages felt like the author was trying to catch a publisher's deadline or something. I had to force myself through it because I was afraid to miss anything. Well I wouldn't have missed too much. So kinda started excited but ended in dissapointment. It could have been a lot better if he could just hold on how he did it in the first part of the book.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone in a serious relationship or looking for a serious relationship. It is very informtive and has you look at your self and your partner.
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|This new album is like a surprise visit from a long lost friend! Fogerty revisits some of the old CCR songs, dusts them off, shakes them up a little and makes them seem brand new. On first listen, I wasn't sure that I particularly liked the changes he had made to some of the most favorite songs from my youth. Messing with perfection is a phrase that came to mind. The longer I listened and the further I got into the album, I slowly realized that I was again being wooed by the same sounds and rhythms that had first drawn me to CCR so many years ago. Fogerty's guttural voice barking out the rock and roll lyrics as only he can, with those driving rhythms that are so perfect for either cruising the strip on a Saturday night or just blasting down the highway, leaving your troubles so very far behind. I especially like the remake of &#34;Lodi&#34; which features him with his sons, Shane & Tyler on guitars. The album is mainly duets with the likes of Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Keith Urban, Zac Brown Band, Miranda Lambert, Alan Jackson, Jennifer Hudson & Kid Rock, but he does do a few by himself and throws in a nice mix of new material as well. If you are a fan of the old CCR or just Fogerty himself, &#34;Ya can't go wrong when you play a little bit of that Creedence Song!&#34;
B00785P2QC|5.0|Lots of fun great game. Will continue to play. Would reccomend to a friend. However it could have better directions
B0053TMP24|5.0|Nice escape. Easy to read with non-stop action. Introduced new characters. Would definitely recommend if you enjoyed the Percy Jackson series.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|hope they continue with another series. I liked the first one the best but the 2nd one was very good also
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I enjoy this game. Can turn into a fantastic time waster but makes you think logically and spacial reasoning. Fantastic!
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I  loved this movie as a child, my children  loved it and now my young  nieces are really enjoying it!
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|This is a fantastic album. I am newly enjoying Blake Shelton and this is awesome. I would recommend this to anyone
0792839749|3.0|This movie is a little hard for young kids to follow and maybe a little depressing/scary too at some parts.
B00005214X|4.0|I had the LP record of this album when it first came out. I forgot I had it in my shed. Presently I don't have a record turntable to play it so I decided to buy the CD. I love George Harrison and think he was one of the more talented Beatles.  Anyway I purchased the CD from Amazon and received it promptly. After receiving it I let it sit for about a month before I finally opened it and played it.<br />Unfortunately two cuts on the CD skipped. I called Amazon to complain and they replaced it promptly at no charge.<br />I have always had good luck in dealing with Amazon.com.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Reminds me a bit of bejeweled, but it's such a great game on it's own and I've sunk hours into it. No bugs or glitches, solid gameplay, and a great leveling system that keeps you interested. Not to mention keeping track of your highest score, which is also amazing. Love this game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I can't say anything but that I have read this book more than 5 times. I love this book a lot!!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The movie was not up to the good quality or standards of the book. Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Was told by professionals, purchase what you can afford, then purchase more. The more you put into your flash the better pictures you will have. I did, and love it!
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Not sure how this ended up in the hard rock/metal category. It rocks, that's for sure, but has more soul and thought behind it than most hard rock these days. Sure, there's plenty of great drumming from Simon Collins, who takes the template established by his Dad to a new level. This album is dense with layers of production in swirling guitars, keys, effects, vocals but has plenty of tender moments and space as well. Simon is aided by partner in crime keyboardist Dave Kerzner (some may remember him from his time with Kevin Gilbert) and the 2 have written and produced a compelling modern sci-fi progressive rock masterpiece about a man caught traveling dimensions and the consequences of these leaps. This band was quick to hit the road to prove their chops and the response has been tremendous - the dates in Europe this spring went down really well - so look for these guys live in the US in 2013 and points beyond. This album for me touches a variety of prog influences including Genesis, Alan Parsons, Dream Theatre, ASIA, Marillion, Kino, It Bites, Porcupine Tree and Pink Floyd. I'm so glad I discovered this album now and can follow the rise of this group.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so fun and easy to use. This game allows you to create your own city as well as design it. Id suggest this game to anyone 10 or older.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I am a big fan of this show.  I watched the first two seasons religiously but was unable to watch the third season on a consistent basis due to work.  When amazon announced the availability of the third season on prime I was glad.  The reason why I think this show works so well is that they try to incorporate current events in thier episodes.  That and the fact that the characters have real depth.<br /><br />You won't be dissappointed if you choose to stream this series on amazon.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Beautiful writing. Complex characters. So much history woven seamlessly through a heartbreaking story. I am so glad I read it.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Like being able to expand map. But slow on reaction time cycling through the Doppler images.ok otherwise not bad to try.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Since it was the final book in the series it was not as exciting as some of the others.  I could see that<br />she was just wrapping up everyone's story line but it was a necessary read because I did love the whole series.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend. The movie was great to watch with her after opening presents.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This series is addictive, the best epic fantasy ever since The Lord of the Rings.  The third season of the HBO TV series however is not as good... leaves a lot to be desired so stick to the books.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|My Irish ancestry, little as it is, was delighted by dialogue that had a familiar ring to it although it wasn't Ameerican-English.<br /><br />The story evoked empathy, tremendous humor and grinding pathos.  One minute I'd find myself laughing out loud, and next  I'd be struck dumb from the pain of an event.<br /><br />I'm sorry, in a way, that I hadn't read  Angela's Ashes before traveling through Ireland.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|minor quibbles with touch reaction time. But for a 5 year old, it fantastic. Would be better to have a more direct way to print artwork.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|My 2 year old loves this movie. He watches it over and over. This move has help with long road trips, even a six hour flight. Its a classic. That on the top 5 for kindle must have.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Another great game from Alawar. This game is worth the price.  Fantastic storyline, great graphics, and the doll was creepy fun.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|We have always been fans of the Boss......But we have lost track over the last few years; I mostly listen to Contemporary Christian most times, and my wife likes oldies(Oldies, like 50's-60's); She said she heard a song on the radio, not an older song, and not a new one, and she really liked it. Girls in Their Summer Clothes, were the words she could remember; I typed them in on You-Tube, and sure enough, a video of the song, showing the cover of an album by Springsteen called Magic was displayed. She looked at several places and wasn't able to locate a copy; I typed it in on Amazon, and sure enough, I found an almost new copy for a great price, Some of the reviews were negative, from i suppose, an audiophile perspective. Complaining that structurally and sound-wise that it was hard for them to listen to. I guess they haven't had to listen to a static filled AM radio straining to hear one's favorite song......waiting for it to come on. When I got the CD I listened to it; Pure Springsteen...Another great work. Many great songs....Then I heard a song: You'll Be Coming Down......As I listened, It almost made me cry....What A Great Song.....But when the Sax solo came on....Pure Clarence Clemons.....He will be missed by all, having been with the Boss for over 40 years.  And it sounds great.
038572179X|5.0|I loved the movie and the book was just as good.  There is so much emotion, sibilng jealously and really brings home the impact of what happens when emotion runs rampant.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Fantastic!!!  I am the next season NOW!!!  Great story line, super actors.  Outstanding production.  Would recommend to any action/adventure fan.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|This movie had a good story and potential for character &#34;development.&#34; However, the actions of the heroes are exaggerated at the end, distracting from the realism of the first 20 minutes, and leading to a childish anti-climax.
0062254936|3.0|After waiting for so long for Requiem, the final installment of the well-loved Delirium trilogy, I wanted to read it as soon as my hands caressed the smooth cover and didn't mind (or scream at) the slightly scary cover girl at all. Time came that the release date was just around the corner and I finally allowed myself to start reading and transport myself back to The Wilds. Surprisingly though, that didn't happen and I was still lying on the sofa wondering if the book will ever start to get interesting.<br /><br />Requiem was so painfully slow. The roller coaster journey that I expected was replaced with a railroad track: turtle-paced and straight. I understand that the plot had to build up before it reached it's climax, but the book was filled with a lot of unnecessary scenes and tedious dialogue. There were a lot of times where I found myself getting bored and wanting to skip entire paragraphs.<br /><br />A lot of conflicts presented in the story were causeless and frustrating to read about. I didn't care too much for the characters, either. They annoyed me to death and it was like they were just using each other. The depth of the relationships in Delirium and Pandemonium were evident but I just couldn't feel them in Delirium. The intense love, regret, thirst for vengeance, and hope that he book was supposed to focus on was near invisible.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writing was masterful as always. Lena's and Hana's point of view were equally well-written and gave voice to the characters. The world-building was magical, believable, raw, and real. I ended up envisioning myself going to places that Lena and Hana went to, and the way the rebellion progressed and how it was planned and executed was well thought of. Lauren's words and sentences were beautiful, fluid, and song-like.  She could effortlessly and seamlessly weave and bend words to her liking, making me want to keep on reading despite the slow pace.<br /><br />Requiem was not a bad conclusion to the trilogy but it just didn't reach my high expectations for it and I am disappointed because of that. The book eventually picked up and got my attention a few chapters before the book ended, though. The climax crept up on me and receded as quickly as it came. Most fans are complaining about the ending because the series was concluded with uncertainty and a lot of questions to be answered but I actually liked it; it was more of a sign of a new beginning than an ending, really. The message it echoed reached me and the last few paragraphs were so raw and truthful; I feel like they would always be a part of me.<br /><br />I am still hungry for a proper epilogue, though.<br /><br />Read more: The Selkie Reads Stories<br />Follow us: @ellietheselkie on Twitterbut it just didn't reach my high expectations for it and I am disappointed because of that.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great game! tons of replayability, and gets more and more challenging. you need to fully level up one shark before getting the next, and you'll need to save your gold to get the next shark.
B0014JKJJI|4.0|These things are so comfortable  I work in a kitchen from 5:30 am to 3 pm and my feet never get tired. I don't slip at all with them when there is grease on the floor. I'd say they are good and the bad part about them is that they don't have holes in them which cause my feet to sweat buut its nothing a switch blade can't fix. :) if they had holes I'd give it a 5...
193700788X|2.0|I looked forward to this book yet I was so disappointed.  Mostly a re-hash of old characters.  Not a lot of excitement or original fun like most of Ms. Harris' books.  Sorry that the series is ending this way.  Update:  I just learned there is another SS book coming out in October and it will be a cold day in Bon Temps before Ms. Harris gets another twenty bucks from me.  This book was truly as advertised, DEAD.
1451697686|5.0|I like this book so much that I ordered more to give as gifts.  I'm turning as many people I know onto &#34;Zero Waste&#34; living.
0061122416|5.0|This is not a book for someone who thinks good literature involves using the longest or most complicated words, nor is it for someone who defines the depth of a book by the complicated psyche of its characters. It's an amazingly simple story with simple characters but with great wisdom regarding following your dreams and listening to your heart. It reminds you of the complacency of life and what it takes - the sacrafices and perserverance - to follow your dreams. It's a book I found best consumed little by little, though it's easily read in a day or two. It's definitely one I'll be reading again and again.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I really do enjoy playing this game. Sometimes I miss he words just to see the hanging. I enjoy the drawings of each step in the hangings.
B00004RD54|5.0|The album that has rock fans everywhere comparing other bands live albums to !<br />The guitar work by Steve Hunter will have you playing &#34;air guitar&#34; as you drive,so be careful !<br />Rock out at your own risk!
0688014291|5.0|An oldy but goody, loved the basic principles of management. I now apply these techniques with my employees and it works
B000MTOLDG|1.0|Over produced,doesn't capture the raw sound that Motorhead is famous for.<br />Don't waste your money !<br />It is if they phoned in the performance.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a fun app but seemed too short until you have to buy to continue.  Puzzles were too easy but graphics are good.  Voice acting was good but the 3D characters looked off a bit.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|When I started watching this movie, I didn't know it had any connection to 9/11.  I've tried for years not to watch movies related to that day because it makes me, well, extremely angry and incredibly sad.  If I could expunge every trace of religion from the brains of every human being and the tribulation it has wreaked upon civilization, and replace it with compassion, sanity, and reason, then I would do so.<br /><br />This movie is about the after effects of that kind of fanaticism, this time 9/11, on one family with a special child.  It made an extremely interesting and incredibly emotional story and is a fine movie.  Well, Tom Hanks is a part of it, so of course it is.  Sandra Bullock is really good as the mother and Max Von Sydow is the master. And how they get a young kid to act like that is simply a mystery.  But if you have any heart at all, you will enjoy this one.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Very easy. To learn this game and its way to play it . Great charters and fun story line. H D graphics are great.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Had to see this season as we missed it on TV.  Only problem is amazon does not stream on my Apple TV so I had to watch from my computer.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I loved the suspense and the action,  I loved Tom Cruise in it too.  He is great and the story was good
B007REV4YI|5.0|I know... We all have our tastes, but I really enjoyed this film, true to the orginal books is this bond and his past. I won't say more, I would want to spoil it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Both of my kids like this game! 10 yo girl and 7 yo boy. Gets their minds working to solve the problems!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This was amazing, I missed it in the cinema, so when I watched it for the first time I was amazed... after the movie I purchased from Amazon the soundtrack, also amazing!
1613832788|1.0|Hard back book yes, but dont think it is to complete your set of first editions. This is a small 4&#34; paperback with a hard cover.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|As good as the movie, with some extras... it has some missing conversations, that the movie left out, and great soundtrack. I f you like the movie, you'll want this too.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I like the different layouts. It is challenging. I really like Mahjong I like the fact that you can change the tiles and background.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Good video quality, easy transaction with Amazon, perfect packaging as always. Bought all three of the Bourne original movies. Plan to buy the latest with Renner. Recommended.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I think they got rid of the inappropriate adds cause I didn't see any. but this same add popes up every time I clicked on something! other than the add problem its a really good fun addicting game.  I enjoyed it a lot!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved it.  The movie was pretty close to the book. I can hardly wait until the next one comes out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love the pacing and characters. Hope there's more. Buy this and read it. You will not be disappointed. I promise.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I am happy the series ended.  After book 9, the rest of the books seemed to just be lacking the energy and story-telling that I feel the first 9 books had.  It wasn't a bad book, but it also just didn't really do much for me.  So I'm glad the series is now ended and the Sookie story is done.  It didn't end how I'd hoped, but I think it is the ending that is most likely in that world.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I feel the relationship Sookie ends up in was what I liked the least.  Mostly because it just seemed to happen over night and there wasn't any real development to make it believable to me.<br /><br />I did like some of the earlier book characters making appearances again in this book, but it was short-lived.  The book read very fast and seemed quite short.  I'm looking forward to reading her follow-up book that will tell what each person did after this book.  Hopefully that will give more closure and more information.<br /><br />I definitely recommend reading it, especially if you've read all the other books and you are a fan of this series.  But as I title this review, it is just a so-so book and just doesn't really compare on quality level to the first 9 books, IMHO.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I have a 7-year-old and she is addicted (as was I, since I insisted on playing it first). Fun graphics, logical progression of skill levels, and the dragon theme is very entertaining. Well done.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|So nice as background music in the office or home, quality material. Preview on You Tube. Well done and looking for more.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Hot off (in my opinion) their best album in years, the Deftones have followed up with another solid outing. While Koi No Yokan does drag a bit in the middle, the overall quality of music is superb. Several songs, including Swerve City and Goon Squad really stand out. With albums like this and Diamond Eyes, it's a shame the Deftones aren't platinum selling artists.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Wonderful musicians and great production! Makes for a great product. Comes with DVD as well. You can preview on You Tube.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy playing. I love all the animals and their play things. I enjoy going to visit friends islands to see how they set up their islands.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|ENJOYED THE PLOT LINES OF THIS SEASON AND, AS USUAL, THE SCENERY AND COSTUMES ARE LOVELY.  DON'T BELIEVE THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE UPPER CLASS INDIVIDUALS WAS QUITE TRUE TO THE ACTUAL ERA IN ENGLAND, BUT THEY WERE MOST INTERESTING.  LOOK FORWARD TO SEASON 4.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book is easier to get through than Good Calories, Bad Calories, but I love them both.  Highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|THE BOOK WAS A GOOD READ, BUT SOMEWHAT OUTSIDE MY INTERESTS.  COMPLICATED PLOT AND NAMES.  BELIEVE THE BOOK WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO TEENS AND TWENTY-SOMETHINGS.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|I'm so glad I finally purchased this on vinyl. It's a great album, destined to be a classics and the liner notes/poster that comes inside is beautiful.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|THIS BOOK WAS ABLE TO WRAP UP ALLTHE LOOSE ENDS OF THE FORMER TWO BOOKS.  FOUND THE NAMES AND PLACES TO BE COMPLICATED FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TO SWEDEN.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|pick 1 thing stay true to it  and give it your best shot.... just be sure its what you really want
1451668945|5.0|This one had a real twist like most of her books, but this was even a better ending to a good mystery
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I was skeptical about how this movie would look on blu ray, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Spielberg's use of robots instead of 1994 CGI showed to be the right move, as the movie held up very well.
0446573027|5.0|Excellent (one of those, I can't put it down). If you like mysteries you will love this book by Baldacci
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|I'm a big PT Anderson fan, and this movie kind of underwhelmed me. The story didn't seem to move at all for me. It was stagnant to me. I understand that the movie is meant to project Freddie's craziness, and you hope he eventually gets better, then as the movie progresses it seemingly flatlines. The acting is great though and the subject matter is interesting.
B009R659L8|1.0|Not like any of her other books.  Pretty slow read. Hope her next book is like her earlier writings. Needs more suspense
B006M9NI48|5.0|I love this book.  I have read it before and Im reading it again.  Its very motivating and positive and helps in all areas of your life,.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|SHORT VERSION: Great, sturdy design, but did not work properly when I got it (see below). I recommend buying the wired version of this controller if you want a guarantee of it working.<br /><br />When I got this controller, there were a couple problems. One being, it would not hold a charge, even when I charged it for 4 hours straight. And so since you can't turn it on, you can't connect it wirelessly. And when I tried plugging it in directly through the dongle to play, it would just be very unresponsive (like it was trying to communicate with the wireless dongle instead of directly through the cord.)<br /><br />The design of the controller is spot on. The only reason why I wanted to get it in the first place is because the original PS3 controller's thumb sticks required too much force to register, unlike the Xbox 360 controller. Thankfully, the thumb sticks on this controller are basically exactly the same as the 360's (the feel, size, locations, and feedback). The rubber grips are also fantastic, and I like how the shoulder buttons feel.<br /><br />I decided to mail it back to get a refund and just buy the wired version of this controller (which works fine and I would rate 5 stars). I would recommend getting the wired if you really want it to work when you get it. But if you want to take a gamble, go ahead and try the wireless one.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This was cheap trash and the only reason this author has made it big is because when everyone start ranting and raving about it you just want to read it to what its all about.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Can't wait to see Part 2!<br /><br />Even though the movie doesn't follow the book exactly as it was written, it's neat how they are trying to include other points of interest from his other books.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was one of my favourite books ever! I love the characters in it. This book has so much action in it. The trip to the land of the dead was very dramatic and I loved it.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Decent acting and directing. Moves quick. Enjoyable if you don't think about it.<br />Plot doesn't really hold together. But no worse than most action films.<br /><br />Doesn't have the same feel as the books. Tom Cruise makes a horrible Jack Reacher.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Sometimes, it was hard to like the protagonist (a little like Kite Runner, in that way), but a really great story. Engrossing.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is show is amazing. The acting is superb, writing phenomenal, and dynamic between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is perfect. Everyone should watch this show!
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis portrays Lincoln like nobody has before.  Great insight into the day to day political struggles and fights.  Buy this movie
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last few books have steadily been going downhill, but this is rock bottom. I don't care about the ending, but to have your character regress in the last book is poor character development.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Time flies by and you read it in two days, maximum. It is that kind of reading. Go for it. NOW. And forget the movie, it doesn't give it justice at all. Stick to the book.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Good movie for history buffs. Big takeaway was the use of executive war powers to end slavery and how slavery could have been reinstated by southern states if the 13th amendment was not passed and ratified.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I feel like it really cleans out all the junk files. This is a great app. And I would recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|it is a great trilogy to read, however books 1 and 3 were much better, still worth getting so that you know then ending for poor Katniss Everdeen.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I use Evernote across all platforms: Desktop, mobile, tablet, and for some reason on my KindleFire HD the text does not line up with what I am typing. The cursor stays at the beginning and I am not able to see or edit what I am typing. Very frustrating when trying to type notes and need to edit them. This bug is what is making me not use it as often, but the ability to have notes sync is hard to get away from.
B008UCDDQS|4.0|Very good quailty movie. Shame he left so early. Could have teach us all how to enjoy and respect life.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Hello i like real steel alot and even fpr the game i find it very challenging because the robot punch 3x faster then you and they break combos really easy but this happens on medium or hard and its hard for me just to beat the tournament even when i use Zues and hard to rematch Atom 4 times literally just to beat him. So can you please fix this and thanks for reading
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I know that this album is a lot older for Sara Bareilles, but she delivers like no other! I love to turn on this album and head for the trail. Soulful, thoughtful, and STRIDES above the little teenie boppers on the radio today that just repeat small amounts of words with Autotune. She is a masterful singer/songwriter, and will be a favorite of mine for a long time to come.

B0095GSKDE|4.0|&#34;Outliers&#34; is full of interesting little patterns and insights into what makes some people successful and others not.  There's a dramatic diversion into the final moments of a doomed airplane that keeps the pages turning.  Some of the conclusions don't seem 100% scientifically provable, but all in all the book is worth a read.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|but lacking the earlier energy of Smiley  Whilst it is very predictable it still makes for a pleasant couple of<br />hours reading.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I liked the first 2 books. But this one seemed like the author was getting tired of writing. I kept waiting for the action and then well into the last few chapters it finally starts only to let you down. All the action that could have been written about is just brushed over and katniss is told about it after she recovers.. Most of the action happens and your just told its over and here is what the results are. If this had been the first book, I would have never finished it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not that I don't enjoy sex, but this book is nothing but a control freak taking advantage of women.  Of course, the woman in this book gives all of herself to this guy. So who is at fault?  Bottom line, I got bored with this book.  Pick up a porn magazine and save yourself some money.
B007FQW7LM|5.0|I have all these on cd and LP and now one more time as they contained extra tracks not released at that time.  Great music.
B00846REIS|5.0|A wonderful contemporary romance in the style of Fifty Shades of Grey but more intense and more in depth development of the psychological background of the female lead.  Eva and Gideon are great characters and I can't wait to read the continuation of their story.
0385736002|4.0|I recently read this book, and I must say that it wasn't anything like what I expected.  First, I expected it to be a fantasy in the regards to castles and knights, taking place during Flamel's life.  It doesn't, and that isn't a bad thing.  I love bridging the gaps in history and legend to that of the present.  Second, being found in the YA section, I expected a bit higher of a reading level.  Once again, it isn't a bad thing.  There are some questionable parts, but, if you keep in mind that this book is more for the really young YA (readers that young generally don't over-analyze like older ones, or English majors, for that matter), it is quite enjoyable.  The incorporation of not just one mythology is great, especially the explanation of how different areas had similar gods/goddesses.  It also delves into the paranormal, giving an explanation to those myths as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read, or for younger readers that have finished the Percy Jackson series but aren't ready for Harry Potter (or haven't read PJ).  I see it as a stepping stone into the more advanced young contemporary fantasy--it's a great starter book.  I'm looking forward to see if the series will be as dynamic as HP or as static like PJ (static isn't bad--it makes for an easy read).<br /><br />Happy reading!
B006PIXKVW|5.0|This is an &#34;updated&#34; color reprise of The Little Princess and follows the earlier movie and the book fairly well.
B001BANK32|4.0|\\"The Shining\\" is a book about a hotel with ghosts, but its biggest ghost today is a guy named Stanley. When people think \\"The Shining,\\" they think not the novel by King but the movie by Kubrick. Even though I enjoy the film more, it's hardly fair. Stephen King not only came up with the story, but his treatment remains definitive for those wanting both chills and human interest.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a guy with problems. Out of work, an abused child who has abused his own son in turn, and a dry drunk, he tries turning his life around looking after a hotel in Colorado, the Overlook, with his wife and son for company. There are things about the Overlook that were, well, overlooked in the job description, like dead bodies in bathtubs and hedge animals that shift position when you don't look at them. Soon, the hotel's menace becomes manifest, and Jack finds himself in its cross hairs. Can he make it through the winter under its malefic influence?<br /><br />Published in 1977, \\"The Shining\\" is a masterful account of a good but weak man under the influence of something way beyond his control. It excels especially in setting up the story, giving you a rooting interest in Jack by engaging you on human terms with who he is and what he is up against. The shift toward the hotel and its supernatural quality happens in degrees so finely pressed you hardly notice them until it's too late. It's a great human interest story with a spring-loaded surprise, even if you think you know what you are getting from having seen the movie.<br /><br />The movie is quite different. Many say it's because Jack, as played by Jack Nicholson, is so unsympathetic. I think a bigger reason is because the movie is rooting for the Overlook. It's a wild, wacky kind of place, very creepy but also kind of funny and even somewhat genuine in its apparent regard for Jack. I kind of get why movie Jack wants to live there forever and ever and ever. Not so in the book. In the book, the Overlook is evil, its spirits sad and vicious. As Danny puts it near the end: \\"Everything is a lie and a cheat.\\"<br /><br />The best parts of the book deal with Jack's tortured rationalizations for doing the hotel's bidding. One great scene has him contemplate disabling a snowmobile that is his family's only means of escape. Book Jack isn't Movie Jack; he really cares about his family, but the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes his family's future depends on his ability to earn same. What good is he to them if he leaves the hotel, his one job, now? You know he's wrong, you know he knows he's wrong, but you can understand the motivation, something Movie Jack never has.<br /><br />The movie still works because the book created the situation the movie only needs to exploit, not explain. Reasons are critical to King's approach, both when they are genuine and when they cross over into rationalizations. It's what makes this novel work, beyond the cold chills it delivers. It's a very grounded experience, and more terrifying that way. You can understand why things are happening because King takes you through them step by step.<br /><br />The novel's resolution is where things get patchy. There are great moments, but some overbaked ones, too. Danny is too precocious for five, the hedge animals too prominently featured, and too much gooey sentiment at the end leaves you wanting something colder and harder. That's what the movie is for, I guess. But King was there first, and that counts for something, especially when the result works so often as well as this.spirits sad and vicious. As Danny puts it near the end: \\"Everything is a lie and a cheat.\\"<br /><br />The best parts of the book deal with Jack's tortured rationalizations for doing the hotel's bidding. One great scene has him contemplate disabling a snowmobile that is his family's only means of escape. Book Jack isn't Movie Jack; he really cares about his family, but the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes his family's future depends on his ability to earn same. What good is he to them if he leaves the hotel, his one job, now? You know he's wrong, you know he knows he's wrong, but you can understand the motivation, something Movie Jack never has.<br /><br />The movie still works because the book created the situation the movie only needs to exploit, not explain. Reasons are critical to King's approach, both when they are genuine and when they cross over into rationalizations. It's what makes this novel work, beyond the cold chills it delivers. It's a very grounded experience, and more terrifying that way. You can understand why things are happening because King takes you through them step by step.<br /><br />The novel's resolution is where things get patchy. There are great moments, but some overbaked ones, too. Danny is too precocious for five, the hedge animals too prominently featured, and too much gooey sentiment at the end leaves you wanting something colder and harder. That's what the movie is for, I guess. But King was there first, and that counts for something, especially when the result works so often as well as this.
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|Miss the quality movies that have a good moral platform, enough action for interest without the B-quality filmaking or corny plots? This one is a keeper.  Check out dove.org for a moral/family perspective.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|What an incredible disappointment.  I get the idea behind QT's vision here but this movie was so rife with racial stereotyping it was simply insulting to everyone.  Even a well rendered performance by DiCaprio couldn't pull value from layers of &#34;cheese&#34; that oozed from the screen to smother the sensibility of  viewers.  It is nothing more than poorly made remake of &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; devoid of comedic wit.
B0024Y7H10|2.0|The writers are searching for a story that they never find. If they had condensed season one into a single episode, they might have had an interesting pilot. Not much happens in the nine episodes of season one.<br /><br />Too many characters are introduced with too little character development. Scenes are short and jump from one character to another. Are the writers trying to figure out which characters belong in the series? (John's chemistry lab partner doesn't.) Or perhaps they hope that rapid scene shifts will prevent us from noticing that there is NO STORY.<br /><br />There were too many flashbacks. They were unnecessary, dull, and occasionally confusing.<br /><br />On a positive note, the casting is good. I found Lena Heady instantly believable as Sarah Connor (yes, she looks different and plays the character differently, but it worked for me). Summer Glau is fascinating in her role. The good guys are likable and the bad guys look like bad guys. Finally, there are fewer of Sarah's silly voice-overs than there were in the second movie.<br /><br />I wanted to like this series, but, as several other reviewers have noted, Summer Glau's scenes are the only ones worth watching.
B003G4W49C|4.0|One of those novels I will no doubt read over and over again. Speaker for the Dead, the sequel to this novel, is great so far as well.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The only thing I dislike about the Firefly series is that it was not renewed. The cast is outstanding and fun to watch!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this book. Right away I liked it, husband comes home and his wife is missing. I liked how it was written: one chapter from the husbands POV (Nick) told starting from the time his wife Amy goes missing, then next chapter was from Amy's diary chronicling their relationship from several years before and leading up to the time she goes missing.<br /><br />Then I started part 2 of the book and it all went downhill from there. Trying not to spoil anything but I felt cheated. A major character turns out to CRAZY and half of what I'd just read wasn't even \\"true\\"...what??? Cheap writers trick if you ask me.<br /><br />Which leads me to part 3, the ending. HATED IT! Hated what happened to the crazy person, hated what the crazy person then did...and we are supposed to believe that these 2 people end up together in the end? Especially since one of them is crazy and evil and the other person knows it but feels trapped and accepts it? I don't think so. Just didn't make sense.<br /><br />OK, this is a SPOILER:<br />In part 1 why does Nick keep describing Amy bleeding to death on the kitchen floor with her head bashed in? Drove me crazy!<br /><br />It was NEVER explained. Just plain only sloppy writing with the story going all over the place and making no sense whatsoever. The story earns 2 stars, but the book was an easy read and kept me going back for more, so I have it 3 stars for suspense.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Feels like I don't laugh much anymore with all life demands; the entire series has been a mandatory &#34;time out&#34; for me to sit back, laugh and forget about everything else.  Love the nerds and their adventures with just enough innuendo and ridiculousness... can't get enough!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|A pretty good senselessly violent movie that employs flashbacks in a failed attempt to usher subplots and extraneous story lines into a epiphanic climax.  If you like senseless violence, it is worth watching.  But the only value in this movie is in the action scenes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As an 80 year old great granny I did need the clues to help me along.  Guess I am getting old. This is not as difficult nor challenging that Myst was years ago, nor the tasks as difficult as in other computer games that I have played but is very refreshing and satisfying .  It is a bit short but I would recommend it to anyone to keep the brain going.<br /><br />Whalehugger4ever..
B005FITIIC|4.0|Blu ray quality is always nice and everything.<br />Good actors, nice trama, and nice price.<br />you should get it and
0143122916|3.0|Shipped well but the book is depressing. It is about being in a North Korean camp, so it was not totally unexpected.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Love Denzel, he is a wonderful man. This movie was by far the biggest nail biter that I've watched in my life!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel--suspenseful, twists, I felt like I got to know the characters personally although I couldn't totally relate to them. Easy, quick read but enjoyable.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Tom Cruise in one of his more &#34;emotional&#34; roles and Dustin Hoffman giving one of his best performances ever.I watched this recently with my &#34;macho&#34; 16 year old son and even he sat riveted to the set and was moved close to tears by this touching &#34;road trip&#34;.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Movies are sharp and bright, lots of special features, and the Amazon price when I bought the set was very reasonable at $35.
1600597963|4.0|A great book for learning new ways to do beads.  I am into Indian jewelry and the ideas are all over this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed this book and found it to be a satisfying resolution to the Sookie Stackhouse series.  My only complaint is that I would have liked to read more interaction between Sookie/Eric and Sookie/Bill in this last book.  I will miss the characters so much that I just wanted more time with them in this book!  However, all relationships were nicely defined and resolved in their own way, so it worked.  The story and pacing was exciting--I made myself slow down because I didn't want it to end!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Possibly my most favorite super hero ever! I love Thor, and all his friends. I can't wait to see the next one.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I got this as the free app of the day and was very excited.  When I first started playing I had access to all 12 restaurants.  A couple days later I noticed it was now 9 restaurants.  Now it is down to 6 restaurants.  I am wondering if it has to do with my looking at extras to purchase and deciding not to.  There is a restore button but when I push it, it says there is an error and it can't restore, so I lose restaurants.  I love the dash games but Playfirst seems a bit money hungry.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|As a working mother of three young children, all I want to do is relax into a book at night when they are all, finally, asleep.  I really enjoyed this novel - a quick, easy, yet entertaining read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great way to not have to fight with my Kindle's screen about getting all of my pins to fit. Smooth use so far...no complaints yet! :)
B005K8QIS0|5.0|My wife and I took a little while to warm up to Jason Isaacs in this series, but it definitely caught on and we are hoping there is another season/series coming.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|A little like this decade's version of Castaway... as a decent story of the strength of the human spirit.  Visually stunning, but felt slow moving at times.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Can't believe it took me this long to finally buy this one! I love Robert Downey Jr., he is fantastic as Iron Man!
B0094K20FK|5.0|I decided to re-watch this after seeing the most recent movie in this franchise, specifically given the similarities (and differences) in the storyline.  It is amazing how cheesy the old graphics and special effects are, but it is still one of the best movies from the original cast.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is an excellent series and if you like zombies or even if you don't this could be the series for you.  There is so much charcter development and the story line makes the zombies almost and after thought.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is the most fun I have had in weeks. This game is like a more awesome and fun version of temple run
0060899190|2.0|It was okay, but I read through all the little post cards in less than an hour and then what?  And really worth a second look.  makes for a decent coffee table book for bored company waiting to leave for the night.  or, maybe to balance out the sofa with a missing leg.
B0094K20FK|4.0|Everyone in the cast gets their moment to shine... a good blend of old and new, action and comedy.  This is the Star Trek that should have been made first.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next one, will definitely buy from Amazon. The best part of this movie is when he saves all the POW's and brings 'em all back!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Best part of the book for me was the retelling of when Release rips up his contracts.....and the belief that he more to discover.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This series is about people who survived after a Zombie Apcolypose.  The problem is that you forget the zombies.  there is so much going on in the series that even if you don't like zombies you may still like this series.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|I NEVER GOT TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT CAME DAMAGED.  THE DVD AND IT'S JACKET WERE BENT OUT OF SHAPE.
0738212415|5.0|Easy, fun. The lessons take more than 20 minutes if you really want to enjoy it. The author encourages creativity and gives plenty of examples from prior students.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Was looking for a good comedy.  After spending 90+ mins with this movie, I was still looking.  Sadly disappointing.  A good premise, but ultimately disappointing result.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game. Not easy to get started, at first wasn't sure what to do. I like all the different games you can play.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Fun since there are no rules. needs more stuff. gets boring because nothing very exiting happens. they need caves and the end. they also need bigger worlds
B009NY43NY|1.0|Well, I was not going to bother writing a review because so many others have already covered the points I wanted to make.<br />But, I cannot seem to avoid it.<br /><br />** Please know that my review will contain spoilers, so do not read further unless you do not mind finding out some of the aspects of the book. **<br /><br />I will begin by stating that I have always loved the series.  I know the last few books were not as great as the earlier ones, but I still enjoyed them because of my love for the characters.<br />I also became a fan years ago when I worked as a librarian in a public library, when the books first came out.  I have read the books in the series several times.  With nearly every new release, I went back and started from the beginning.  That is how much I loved the series.<br />I put off reading the last one simply because I hated for the series to end.  I remember feeling the same with Harry Potter, but I thought the series ended beautifully.  I could not have asked for better from the author.  I so wish I could feel the same about the end to this beloved series.<br />After reading no reviews, I finally bought the book for my Kindle this week and finished in a day.  I am sorry to say it was a waste of time.  I was simply shocked after I finished the book.<br />Here are the main reasons why:<br />1.  The book did not even seem to be written by Harris.  I assume it was, what do I know?  But as an avid reader for so many years, I did not even recognize her style in Dead Ever After. It seemed written by someone with no love for the characters at all.<br />2.  There were inconsistencies throughout the entire book.  I know that happens with any series, especially one as long as this one.  But, there were just too many things that did not make sense.  The most glaring one being that suddenly Sookie can no longer hear Supes' minds at all.  What about the whole pack confrontation between Alcide and Patrick, where Sookie was the interpreter of whether they were being honest?  It was just odd.<br />3.  The end of Eric and Sookie was written in a way that most longtime readers would never believe.<br />We spent years falling for Eric as a character and even if you are not a fan of his, to dismiss him and just send him away is ridiculous.  It was just over.<br />4.  Sam made some sort of deal with Eric about bailing Sookie out of jail.  In return for Eric posting bail, Sam promised not to court her.  What????  It was the most poorly written storyline I have ever read.  I still do not get it.<br />5.  Claude comes after Sookie.  Niall basically let him escape in order to find another traitor.  As protective as Niall is, why would he allow Claude to escape, especially knowing how Claude betrayed Sookie?<br />6.  Any finally, a devil?  Really?  He was mentioned a few times in the beginning, along with the \\"tall man\\" and \\"medium man.\\"  We later find out their identities, and the devil fades out and is not mentioned again.<br /><br />Now, please remember that this review is just my opinion, although many seem to share in feeling disappointed by the end.  I feel like I am betraying one of my favorite authors and it almost hurts me to do so.  But, I can honestly say I have rarely read a book that was more poorly put together than this one.  I am so disappointed and wish I had not read it.  I would rather have left it open-ended after the previous book than have had it end this way.  And no, it is not who Sookie ended up with that bothers me the most.  I respect an author ending things the way he or she wishes.  It was just not a well written ending to such a spectacular series.  I felt like it was a bit of an insult to devoted fans of the series.  Sad, just sad!ere being honest?  It was just odd.<br />3.

B00B3HJMLM|4.0|:)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought this book had a decent plot. The premise of the games in this book is kinda interesting, and you're really not sure how the games will turn out until the very end.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Really fun. Graphics are good:) I like the story as well. I recommend this to all people who like medieval fantasy.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is crappy so I am giving it a bad review and I hope you make it better to read.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Its awesome and i love playing it! Also its free.... SO YOUR GETING AN AWESOME GAME THATS FREE!! OH MY GOSH YAY!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey.  Was happy it came out earlier than June 18th!  Have watched the first three episodes and as always, can't wait to watch the next.  New twists and turns!
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|This had to have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The southern accents were totally unbelievable.  A lot of the characters did not come across as realistic in any way, even the ones that were normal humans.  The costumes they put on Lena's family members were silly and made the movie look like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a parody of a witch story or a real witch story.  The book wasn't good either but I was hoping that the movie would be an improvement. With the right actors, I think the movie could have been done well.  The only actor in this film who I thought was half decent was the one who portrayed Lena.  Ethan would have been ok if it wasn't for that awful accent.  I've been to the South,  almost no one talks like that,  it was totally overdone.  I feel bad for the authors of this book,  this movie totally butchered their book.
B00003CXDG|4.0|I bought the dvd cause it was cheaper than renting the download but now I see that Netflix and Prime have the download. It might be the weaker of all the MI movies it is still worth watching.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is by far the best series ever! I have enjoyed this series and highly highly recommend! You will love it!
0783229526|5.0|Quality of DVD very good. No problems with viewing DVD. Excellent Oliver Stone directed movie. I very good deal for the price.
B0047E9TRA|4.0|Kind of a sad story, but at the same time well done. Who needs a documentary on bullies, just make kids watch Carrie :D
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Excellent song.  Induces spontaneous dancing.  4 stars because the full album version is better (longer, more details to the guitar work, etc) than this abbreviated radio edit.
B005LAII3U|5.0|This movie was better than the original!  Even though it wasn't set in Mars, the action, the plot, and the characters were incredible!
B00846REIS|5.0|A must read....at first i thought it was going to be slow but once I started I couldn't put it down.
B006YMLE7G|4.0|I like this movie.  It was action packed and very entertaining.  I would recommend this movie to anyone even those who are not fans of the Anime genre.
B00005NB8K|3.0|Quality of DVD okay. Some problems with viewing DVD. Excellent Oliver Stone directed movie. I very good deal for the price.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|This is a great album. I have a hard time choosing which is better, Back to Black or Frank? This is a must have for Amy Winehouse fans!
1439153663|5.0|Could not put this book down - I finished it in a weekend -- would recommend it for book club reading as well as individual reading.
1416550542|5.0|As in most of Kate Morton's books, this protagonist finds a family secret and takes you along on her search for answers. I found this generational book with history, romance, family relationships and mysterious family secrets revealed, to be fascinating. This was Kate Morton's first novel. Even then, her writing was flawless, never intruding on the storytelling.<br /><br />The story begins in London when a little girl is abandoned on a ship bound for Australia. Watched over by strangers, she's left on the dock in Brisbane and finally rescued and raised by the dock manager and his wife. When she is 21, they tell her the truth of her origins but have no further information for her. Her name is not her own, for she was told to keep the secret in London and now she has forgotten even that and any small facts that might have helped.  The book is \\"Nell's\\" search for herself, interrupted by marriage and family, and restarted with her beloved grand-daughter's interest very late in Nell's life. It is both breath-taking and spellbinding and, like me, you may well be sorry when it's over.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Inexpensive, Compact. Tis is a great sharpener and All you need in the field. What more can I say. Thanks
0593070631|5.0|These four boys stole my heart long ago for their candor and humor, Unsaid Things delivers in every way. I would like to thank them for sharing otherwise inside moments between best friends and giving their fans such a lovely treat.
B0064OUGK0|3.0|Quality of DVD very good. No problems with viewing DVD. Excellent Oliver Stone directed movie. A very good deal for the price. However, this DVD would not play on cetain DVD players arising the suspicion that it may have been pirated.
B00ABO573A|4.0|Again, a very hot emotionally charged gay love.  But, unfortunately drugs and booze ruin what was an ideal relationship. All in all a good story.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|If you like temle run  you will like temple run oz . If you never played a temple run before you would love it alot.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie was terrible. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for stupid. To each their own. Happy movie watching:)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It may be considered YA, but its a worthy read for anyone...you can't help but love the characters!! Very well written and so good that you could easily read it in just a couple hours, if you had a couple hours to do just that!
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|My favorite Star Trek film of all time. Simply brilliant! Excellent writing and directing. Hilarious and heart warming.  Zany antics of the original crew.
B000003CMC|5.0|My Favorite all time Almlman Brothers song 'One Way Out&#34; is on this album. That in itself would make me buy it!
B00003CXRM|5.0|an excellent story in an unusual time in American history.  A very believale story and the music isn't that bad either.  The three &#34;brothers&#34; are a good match and their chemistry shows throughout the video.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Very well done film, gritty and probably very close to the truth of what happened and how information was obtained. However, the length of the film was problematic. I don't know how it could be shortened and they probably edited as much as they could without reducing the impact.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have already passed and repassed this game almost 4 times. that's how awesome it is. I hope people read this review and understand that this game.....is as good as it gets.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|This is a must read.  We've just returned from South Africa and Nelson Mandela's story gave me the background to ask the questions of our guides to help us understand.  What an inspirational leader.  South Africa is the only African country that didn't erupt in total civil war and the way to colonial independence.  He is a true peacemaker.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book will keep a smile on your face through the entire book! It is written through the guys perspective and it is so funny. I can't wait for her to write another book. Definite 5+ star
B000003CMB|5.0|What can I say about this Band and this Album! Always one of my Favorites!Thanks for the Memories.Gregg Allman's Best
B00CRW2066|5.0|This is the first National album I've listened to. It's great for a mellow listen... if you're feeling down or want to relax, it's great, but if you want something uplifting, not the album for you.<br />I couldn't get it off my iPod for a full week... I played this nonstop at least 45 times.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Such a great film, Didnt know a thing about John carter from mars until I watched the film now I'm hooked on the original books and hoping for a sequel!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Yes, my wife absolutely loved this book and bought the movie too.  She would kill me for rating this one star, that alone may help you decide to buy this book if you're into this genre.  I'm not, and for me it was enough to gag a maggot.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Sounds and plays like a real pinball machine.  Includes the needed attention to table rules for sequential shots to score bonuses and jackpots.  Free sample table The Sorcerer 's Lair was great fun and I look forward to trying other tables.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever.It is a page turner and its engrossing.Everyone should be required to read this book.
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|There are some solid songs on this album. Some songs have an older strokes sound, but with some new touches.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|I still like it - have ever since I read the first book - but it's really stretching.  Like, how does Dexter live on so little sleep?  How does he &#34;borrow&#34; a crematorium on a moment's notice?  Where the hell is Harrison all the time?  How does his sister handle discovering his true self so calmly and quickly?  I know it's a one hour show that has to wrap things up before the night is out, but still, it's getting too incredible.<br /><br />But I still like it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Amazon needs 2 get w/ the program on updates. I have this on my iPod nd the game should have changed/updated 2 Miami.
0307474259|4.0|A good one to read more then once.  Came recommended to me and I'm glad purchased my own copy. Interesting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Ok, so I was late to the game and didn't start watching the series until the episode after Sybil dies ... so, I watched on PBS the rest of the season, caught up on Amazon Prime with seasons 1 and 2 ... and then just had to get season 3.  Not disappointed in the least!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Wow, awesome movie that I really couldn't get enough of, when are we going to see a sequel? From start to finish I was entertained, hopefully we see a sequel to a movie that gains fans by the day!
B009NF6IPE|5.0|Love a story about different cultures and the difficulties the different face. A tragic story in many ways. Love the way the author manage to describe the lives of different people in different cultures. highly realistic. Could not put the book down. Absolutely loved it!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Feast for Crows was meandering and kinda dull, but this book picks it back up!  Some exciting events occur and even the exposition is more entertaining (but not in the same way the TV show does it - &#34;sexposition&#34;).  I was sorry when it ended and it whetted my appetite for the next book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I couldn't stop watching it. I've always loved Mr. Lewis he brings the character to life in this series. I can't wait for the 2nd season to get to me.
020161622X|2.0|I am on the last chapter of this book. This book is incredibly short. If it were packed full of useful information, short would be a good thing. However, almost every section barely touches the topic at hand. It introduces many good programming concepts, but mostly just references a bunch of other books. It seems like a cheap way of spouting out opinions without sufficient explanation.<br /><br />Perhaps I read this book too far along in my career where most of this advice seems obvious. Still, there are entire books about some of the referenced topics that only span five pages or less. How is that enough detail to motivate an up-and-coming developer to go out and learn more?<br /><br />I feel like this book was the author's attempt to market their own consulting business. Just enough to get them recognized. Really, this book can be summed up with some simple advice: use your brain and be passionate about what you are doing. Does that seem too opinionated or over-simplified? Hey, so is this book!
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I really liked season 1 so was so excited for season 2. I hated season 2. Poor character development and torture and gore for no purpose but shock value. Disappointment.
0525478817|5.0|This is my new favorite book! I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone especially teenage girls! Love, love, love!!!!!!
0765325950|3.0|Nothing wrong with the seller on this but I was disappointed in the way the series ended.  It's too bad Rober Jordan didn't live long enough to finish this right.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like that your able to unlock more characters and work towards goals. I also like the the daily challenges and missions.
B00CW665VI|5.0|i absolutely loved the book.  the chemistry between the main characters is incredible.  the fact that it is written from a man´s point of view is very different from everything that is out there in the same genre.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the Hannibal mythos. Filling Anthony Hopkins shoes is a pretty daunting task, but Mikkelson does an excellent job.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much it is my favorite app in my app slide deserves a solid 5 stars
B000W91RUG|1.0|TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|wonderful for dr. office or keeping attention when needed.  Also great at teaching pations as well as watching your money.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My boys enjoyed it imensely.  Watched it four times in 48 hrs.  They want it again for this weekend!  Add more lego movies,
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I had already written a review on this CD before.  It was probably on another screen.  I am surprised you want another.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i was really good at this awsome game but beware it will delete your stuff i was playing i turned my tablet off to eat and when i got back on all my characters, boards, trophies , money,and keys were gone .
B00CI21EBC|1.0|I haven't been into the Brand New Heavies since \\"Shelter.\\"  I bought this album to listen to on a long road trip.  The next song sounded like another disco version of the previous song.  I was waiting on the hit that never came.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It's like the new Stars Wars movies vs. the original.  No character development.  Weak story.  Average digital effects.  Great cinematography.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This was a very clever & smart movie indeed. Afterwards (or even before that) go and visit the ablixa website: [...]
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|We love playing this game.  It is a lot of fun and love the different areas through out the game.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I already wrote about all of the Harry Potter shows.  They were all very good but a couple of them were too dark to see on the TV.  I also have all of the books as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME. iT MAKES ME THINK AND THAT IS GOOD. iT IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE. I PLAY IT ABOUT EVERY DAY.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|This music was all over the place.  Hard to understand in many places. What bugged me the most was his listing of everyone he was giving thanks for their help. He threw in his fans (Grobanites) a handful of thanks. I felt like and feel like he doesn't appreciate all of us who have been loyal followers. I was insulted and won't pre-order another CD.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I was hoping Joe would go further in the direction of his last record using Mike Keneally a bit more for the fusion aspect but he didn't. very nice record non the less.....
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|As someone who was not impressed at all by &#34;Into Darkness&#34; I will be saving my money and waiting for the next movie to come to Red Box.&#34;Into Darkness&#34; was stupid and full of Star Wars gimmicks ( similar phrases, sound effects, and even air ships near the end where Spock is chasing Khan). When I watch Star Trek that's what I want to see. Into Darkness was far more like Star Wars then a Star Trek film ever should be. All action and very little substance. Star Trek 5-The Final Frontier has always been regarded by most fans as being the absolute worst of any the Star Trek films. Well, after 25 years(as of this article) Star Trek 5 can finally move over for a new champion of Star Trek stupidity. Welcome, Into Darkness, as being the worst Star Trek film/story of all time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoyed watching Downton Abbey season 2. It came fast, and I'm so glad I was able to watch what I missed on TV
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book continued the story and did not disappoint.  I am losing some hope for one of the romantic choices for America.  I won't say which one so that nothing is given away.  However, no matter what happens - I am interested to find out, and I will be getting the 3rd book as soon as it comes out.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|I love this record & I still do after all this time.<br />If you love this record you should also pick up his other music.<br />Pick up This Loud Morning, this is his last record.<br />While your at it pick up his new single called Laying Me Low. Check it out. You won't be dissapointed.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I like his first CD the most. I feel like Groban is trying to find where he fits in in the music world. I think he's too cocky and is going off in all directions. I think he should stay with what he does best. The next two albums are a let down good. They each have a few songs worth listening to but many are hard to understand.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Great record that grows on you the more you listen to it! Steve Morse is exceptional and really brought this band to a new level since joining back in 1996...... Yes! Steve Morse has been playing with deep Purple since then.... Get over it and move on......
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Don't let the &#34;forward-backward&#34; in time, cloud your understanding.  Think of it as cubist art in literature...basically about 5 vignettes that would be interesting short stories, but for this movie, were cut apart and reassembled...all the stories have a beginning, middle, and end, but like a kaleidoscope, they come together and pull apart until the over-riding philosophies begin to weave them back together again.
B006QSL9XC|5.0|A very historically accurate version of this terrible battle.  I find it hard to believe how Commanders would march their men to slaughter like they used to do.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn't like it.  It was boring compared to the others and you could see where it was going from miles away.  I think she checked out on this book.  I didn't stand up to the others.  Read it if you are an avid fan otherwise don't bother.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like having the Weather Channel App on my Kindle. I do not have to turn on the tv first thing in the morning to see the weather. It is at the touch of a finger.
B00AA0U05A|2.0|I bought this CD after hearing one song. Fortunately it was a huge fit with a friend who is 85. She loves it. I have to say that I have other movies from this time period and enjoy them. This one just didn't do it for me.
B00821OX98|5.0|In a time when Sci-Fi lovers, and Trekkie's like myself, are aching for a series worthy of the genera; Falling Skies is it. Hands down, the show is the best of Science Fiction on television currently. New Season #3 starts on June 9th 2013 (TNT).<br />Remember fans, Keep up letters and e-mails to studios to bring back a new Star Trek TV series! You know you want it, I know they have one in the queue for Green Light.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|This is the PERFECT movie for your erudite friends that find Slasher movies to be just so much palaver.  This is the thinking person's horror-story.  Get out your tape-measure to see just how high that \\"jump\\" really is!  You will be amazed!
B006GLMHBM|3.0|I think &#34;Sex & The City&#34; has gotten better since the first season, but it was a reasonably good beginning. The characters are a little slow to develop into real individuals here, and there are a few too many &#34;person on the street&#34; type quotes cut in, especially in the first couple of episodes, but by the end of the season, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha are fully-drawn (if by definition somewhat caricatured).<br />I watched a few episodes from the first series again recently, and was struck by how very dated it all seemed. The world SATC depicts is very much the pre-9/11 America of the Clinton era - buoyant, culturally liberal, overconfident and slightly intoxicated with its own economic success. The cumulative impact of 9/11, the Iraq War and a great financial crash have taken their toll and the series now seems emblematic of a quite different, altogether less vulnerable era. Even the film felt dated when it came out (although this did not stop me from enjoying it).
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My friend had this games and I loved it so much I got it. It is really fun but gets boring after a while but it's free so that's okay.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a wonderful, thought provoking, and emotional book. You need to read this! Don't hesitate. Rock on nerd fighters!
B001DLWF8U|2.0|Weird Show, hard to follow. I did not enjoy watching it, and I would not suggest it to a friend.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I'm a total fan of the series, so I won't be evaluating the show, just the presentation.<br /><br />Pros-<br />The episodes are so beautiful, it's like watching them for the first time.  The sound is great on my 5.1 audio system, and the visual effects are stunning!  It's great to see the Enterprise D in such gorgeous detail. All the planets look real, and not just like blurry land masses covered by wisps of atmosphere.  All the alien ships show detail that only the model builders themselves ever got to see before.  Totally awesome, and a must buy for any fan of the show.<br /><br />Con-<br />If I had to find something negative to say about this set it's this; Bare bones labeling on the discs.  On my previous DVDs form all the Trek series, each disc had a list of what episodes are on it.  Makes sense when looking for a particular episode.  Not so here.  The discs only give season and disc number, and in order to find what disc the episode you're looking for is on you have to physically remove the paper insert from around the outside of the case which has the episodes listed on the inside!  Ridiculous!  Bad enough not to have labels, but not even to list the episodes on the back of the case, or on an insert inside and in easy view is beyond silly, it is in fact moronic.  The show itself is excellent :)<br /><br />Bottom line-<br />Buy this set.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Sorry, but I did not realize that the story would end BEFORE the novel (but, that's because I avoid movie trailers).  Still. if you are a Hobbit fan, you just want the story NEVER TO END; so, it won't truly bother Hobbit fans that the end is drawn out...just a bit more... to create a Part II &#60;smile&#62;.  Setting and acting are equal to previous Hobbit movies, and keeps viewers engaged.  Will any director attempt The Silmarillion?  Hobbit fans await.
B00BF11STU|4.0|My first reaction to Zero Dark Thirty was that it was a near-great film but that it wasn't great because it didn't show that the people who do this work (relentlessly torture, hunt, and kill people) must be able to shelve their own lives/humanity for the time it takes them to accomplish their mission. This film does everything so well that it seemed a shame that director Kathryn Bigelow didn't show that Maya (Jessica Chastain) was in any way conflicted or troubled about the torture she witnessed and allowed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb Racing is a great game to play! I recommend it to everyone of all ages. My little brother is seven and he plays it. It's really easy to play.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Bought it as a gift for a boy I want a future with :)... He loved it since we are both big fans of Demi.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Classic Tarantino.  Great movie with lots of action.  The almost three hour run time is both sa course and a blessing.  It's a long watch but stays interesting throughout.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Walter White is the king! Great show, a must watch! I'm in awe on how great this show is, each season just gets better and better! I cant wait to see how they end this series!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|OK, so the premise is a little silly.  But the graphics are clean, the music is fun, the sound effects are cute, and the gameplay is addictive!  I love the &#34;crown mode&#34; where you have to twist around the thinking a little in order to get fewer stars, or no stars, in order to complete the game.  And it's good for the whole family... my toddler loves playing just so he can swipe the little blobs off the screen and hear them crash and grumble.
B00C4QPYJU|4.0|The kid in the movie wasn't the best actor, but its a good flick.  There's a lot of huge guys in the arm wrestling matches.. Good 80's movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game ever you should change gold org into butter org and when you find iron org put more gold org and dimans org
B00BESIKWM|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Silent Hill saga and this movie is a huge improvement over the previous one. It's slick, creepy and fun to watch. Would definitely recommend to those looking for a horror movie thrill!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This is the book that started it all, and the very first I read in the 'AB Series'. Before you read ANY other works of AB, you should read this one first as the others relate back to this one on occassion. Very insightful look into the 'underworld' of kicthens throughout NYC and the trials and tribulations of Anthony's 'early years'
B000XUBFE2|5.0|i'm not finished with this book yet, but almost there...it is an amazing read. love the historical aspects (and i'm not one who normally gravitates to these types of stories) and the characters feel so real and relatable. i highly recommend it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am always on the lookout for anything that will help me fall asleep, so when this app went for free I had to try it.  The selection of sounds is enormous!  There are only a handful that I think would be relaxing, but that's just me.  I've only tried it once so far, but it worked well.  Useful app.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It has been more than 20 years since I began reading these books. At long last they have come to the end. An end, as there can be no true ending in the Wheel of Time. Thank you Robert Jordan and Branden Sanderson for giving me a wonderful way to spend two decades of my life. I wish I could go back and do it all over again. Maybe I will, when the wheel turns my way once more.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This movie is wonderful, with a cute story line and great acting. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Meg Ryan or Hugh Jackman. They present a wonderful contrast of comedy and class in the juxtaposition of an 1870s attitude with a 21st century one.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I hear people complain that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis don't focus on &#34;the real issues&#34; anymore (such as why they've been able to avoid the violence and severe poverty that many other rappers struggle out of because they didn't grow up in the ghetto fearing for their lives.) Here's the deal: they already wrote music about that, and if they want to focus on other issues, it's not only their right, but they do a good job of it, too. Yes, some topics are revisited here that many will recognize from the previous album. Some social issues are ongoing, some issues may be preferable to an artist, some issues may just not fit an album. Who knows?<br /><br />The Heist is almost all fantastic, save only for maybe two tracks with sub-par &#34;featured artists&#34; or redundant messages (10,000 Hours and Thin Line come to mind.) But that's a personal opinion, I won't judge the album by it.<br /><br />There are a few tracks with particularly catchy, motivating beats (Can't Hold Us, Thrift Shop, and Make the Money, especially.) Same Love remains one of my absolute favorites, both for the message and the mood. Personally I felt that the simple, sentimental piano chords were overused in this album (though it fit perfectly in Same Love), but I understand that sometimes there's a subtle theme that might tie an album together, so I won't judge it based on that reappearing piano.<br /><br />It's refreshing to hear a man express uncertainty. It's human. He's uncertain with his stance and his willingness to speak up for others. Afraid of speaking up and being labeled an apologist who should back out because he hasn't experienced the life of a racial minority, but driven to speak up for the suffering of others. Wanting to enjoy his success, but constantly reminding himself that his fly shoes and slick caddy aren't what make him a worthwhile person. Wanting to set an example, but being ashamed of his flaws.<br /><br />Buy it, listen to it, support artists.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|I love to watch these guys on You Tube.  And found the album just so-so.  Need the visuals for the big wow factor.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Easy to use!<br />Plugged 1 end into my Bose IPOD player and the other into my phone.<br />Listening to my stations on Pandora now!<br />Sounds great, No static !!<br />I got another for plugging into the IPOD player in my daughter's JEEP.<br />There was also a note inside the box that said if you have any trouble contact Cable Jive directly and they will make it right!<br />I love it when stuff works!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book somewhat of a disappointment.  The first third of the book was terrific and introduced characters that captured my attention and whom I began to deeply care about.  But then the author veers from the narrative of these characters and spends much of the remaining portion the book detailing the life histories of characters that have only the slightest of connections to the initial narrative.  While, individually, those life histories are well-written and interesting, their questionable or nearly non-existent connection to the original characters made the book feel less like a novel and more like a collection of short stories about enduring family hardships.  Almost as if the author decided to fill a large number of pages by providing detailed backstories for a group of random people that met at a party but who lacked any meaningful connection to the primary characters.<br /><br />Eventually, the book begins to answer some of the questions about the fate of the original characters but, by this time, I felt the narrative arc had become so disjointed that I struggled to remember why I still cared.<br /><br />I think someone reading this book could skip the chapters about the two cousins that return to Afghanistan, the chapter about the Greek doctor, and the chapter about the child of the former Jihadist and come away with a more satisfying read.<br /><br />I hate criticizing this book because I loved Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns may be my favorite book of all-time.  Khalid Hosseini is certainly a great writer but this book could have used a little more narrative focus in my opinion.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This is an excellent app for people who want to learn different knots. I love how you can slow down the demo and replay it as many times you want.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love all Ms Harris' Books. I like them because you laugh, cry, and live what Sookie does in these books.
156224003X|3.0|This book explains one person's method of learning to play music.  It is more concerned with improvising.  The method would itself be hard to follow especially if you are an active performer.
B0083Z614S|3.0|This is a cute story, and it's easy to understand, but the story isnt very captivating at all.  If you have a lot of time on your hands you might consider it, but if you are looking for a page turner, this is not the way to go.
B005MLW8DO|4.0|Jerry Sienfeld plays pretty much himself (considering he has writing credit I'm not surprised) in bee form. Cute, upbeat movie with some good chuckles.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Graphics are average.  Game is kind of easy.  My kids enjoy it more than I do.  Good way to kill time if waiting somewhere.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was chosen for our book club.  It kept my interest throughout! The author kept the pace intriguing and believable, with some surprises as well.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Love Smash. I was so excited to see it was free on Amazon. I'm kinda bummed that they've cancelled the show.
030758836X|4.0|Have a hard time describing the book without giving away the plot.  My daughter told me to just keep reading when I had the plot all ready worked out in the first 60 pages. She was right every chapter something surprising happen.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great Price. Awesome movie series. Nice box set. Don't really know what else to say about it, but I am told that I need 12 more words before I can submit, so there, that ought to do it.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|basically a rehash (updated) version of Vonneguts Slaughterhouse 5 premise using reincarnation as the basis for the stories characters interactions throughout time. The jumps through time leave little chance for character development and ocassionally the acting seemed forced.
B006YC74E8|4.0|This does do a lot but it is unneeded cause kindle has a hidden camera app.  All you have to fire is download es file explorer.  Check out my review on that app it's a must have.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I downloaded the lep world 1 and when my granddaughters found it on my tablet they really enjoyed it so I thought I would try this one and my granddaughters and I enjoy this one also
0307341550|5.0|After reading Gone Girl, I was very curious about this author and did some research. When I found out she wrote two other books before Gone Girl, I was on a mission to read her other books she published. I just finished read Sharp Objects and I must say: I'm thankful my own mother is nothing like Camille's. The book was very, very direct with excellent writing prose (I do admire Gillian's writing). The details were on point (and descriptive enough to make me literally sick to my stomach). I don't know if I would recommend reading on a full or empty stomach considering certain events made me cringe inwardly. There were some facts in the book that were very truthful and relatable in real life and I'm glad the author made this evident.<br /><br />The characters in the book are weird, nasty, and stunning in their own ways. I hope I can get some sleep tonight.<br /><br />The one reviewers are silly. This is a very good debut and I would read it again (with a stronger stomach in the future). I purchased Dark Places and I'm about to read that book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Historical Novel of the Nazi rise in Germany.  Perpective of real families caught up in Hitler's rise to power in Germany.  The book also brought  in families in England, Russia and the United States.  If textbook history bores you, this book will make it so interesting that you cannot put it down.  My favorite subject has always been history so cannot wait for his next book.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|I decided to rent the movie because the description was as thriller, and yes!, good actors too!. To be honest I did not get to see the end of it and don't care!, it is one of the most depressing movies I've seen, how can people watch this?!. Any way it is about a girl who kills her husband under medication, that's it..
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Not the best book or the longest of the series but still a must read to go through the series
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is a Mario knock off.  It's fun to play, the controls work good, and the graphics are pretty good.  Fun and exciting Irish themed music play their thru out the levels
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe always makes useful and high quality products.  Works well as a PDF reader.  It is nice that it is free too.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Besides the first two Godfather movies, there are no other films so poignant and descriptive of the cosa nostra.  I hope I never run afoul of them.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This was a fun movie.  I have collected over 200 different Oz books and as many movies as have been produced.  This may not have clung to canon stories of Baum; but did anyone really think Disney would?  MGM was pretty liberal with their interpretation of the books, too. It was entertaining as there was no overwhelming social message --- just like all the Oz books.  Be nice, treat people well, and stop evil from spreading.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Just a great movie. Lots of action and humor from \\"older\\" actors. Excellent change of pace from other action films. Did I hear there is another one coming out? Look forward to it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love love this series, can't wait for Season 3 to start. Still working on Season two but its a great watch
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|There is no point to this game.  Yeah it is a little creepy but doesn't have much replay value.  Movie this is based on was pretty good.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I hate looking ar reviews because they are two commercailized and its obvious. Its a calculator that's add supported with less features than the one that comes with my phone. Mine has memory and can be switched to a scientific mode. There are better calculators for down loads that are truly free. Don't waste your time. Its another overrated, over commercialized, underquality app like so many. Don't waste your time or memory your factory calculator is superior.
B00BDSRBEG|5.0|After the other members of OMD left in the late 80s, the later releases with just Andy on board were, IMO, bad dance/club type music.  My taste in music tends to be more guitar/live instrument based simply because there are very few synth oriented bands who's music really stands up over time without sounding dated.  OMD's early output was original with great melodies and a soulfulness in Andy's vocals.  I've missed that band and was happy to hear that Paul, Malcolm and Martin were returning a few years ago.  History of Modern was a step in the right direction, but IMO didn't live up to OMD's early output.<br /><br />I ordered the vinyl version of English Electric (which comes with a cd of the album as well), put it on and it's like hearing a long lost classic OMD record - beginning to end.  It's a perfect beginning to end album.  It sounds so fresh (dare I say, youthful?).  I'm not an \\"80s music\\" guy.  Quite a few great bands/artists came out of that decade but I've always bought new music and kept an interest in new bands - particularly more rock oriented bands.  The only reason I mention that is to make the point that this is a great record period rather than simply a \\"retro\\" record with limited appeal to 80s music fans (though it would certainly appeal to those as well).  Great music is timeless, and this album has that timeless quality about it.<br /><br />After seeing some clips of OMD performing this year at Coachella and hearing English Electric - OMD have, in my mind, gone from being simply a band who got back together to make some new music to a band who are hungry and vital again.  I hear their live shows have been awesome (and I believe it after seeing the Coachella clips) and wish they would tour the southern U.S. so I could check them out live for myself.  English Electric is a welcome surprise.  Really thought OMD's best days were long behind them but they've kicked that notion down the road.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|All I can say is WTF? I am not sure I could honestly find anything redeemable in this video. Lame script and acting. I couldn't finish it. I wish Amazon would give me credit for the unwatched portion.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Although wrtten 150 years ago it is stll able to elicit profound emotions about love, integrity and redemption.  Plus, the price is right!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So hooked on this show!  I've seen seasons 1 & 2 but holding off on season 3 because of how everyone I upset with the story line.  Season 2 leaves you in a perfect, happy place.  :)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a must have also for all kindle fire owners because someone at Amazon thought we shouldn't have complete control of our devices like if you bought a home pc.  Let's you copy, send, and backup files and apps.  Easy search feature to find stuff.  Seems to have a remote connect feature for your home pc.  As of right now not tested.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|the new temple run looked super exciting but the graphics make it hard to follow. the graphics in the first one are better do you call that an improvement?!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I loved the way the author described the environment, the situation, and the way she describe Katniss Everdene`s feelings.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Whimsy Kid books really appeal to preadolescent students.  They are fun, true to life and yet still appropriate for this age student.  My son hates reading, but he loves these books.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This may be the last CD I bought, and it was years ago. If I still listened to any of my CD's, this would be one of them. Much better than Mraz's subsequent CD.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I started reading these books 20 years ago.  I could not wait for the end, and like many other I was dissapointned by the delay in the e-book release, but I dealt with it.  I have generally been pretty happy with Sanderson's adaptation because he made the women a little less bossy and more human, plus there was actually resolution to issues instead of hundreds of instances of foreshadowing.  This book I felt he left a little bit flat.<br /><br />The writing seems to be more juvenille than what I remember in this volume.  I also think he puts too much emphasis on the wrong things, and others things are cut short and feel rushed.  I had read that Robert Jordan wrote a detailed outline and it seems that in some of the later chapters Sanderson is just expanding on that outline to turn it into text.  Yet, the \\"last battle\\" chapter is 190 pages long.  The point could be made more quickly and I wouldn't mind the longer text if it was more elegant.<br /><br />I'm not giving away spoilers, but the end was not earth shattering to me.  Much of it was predictable and was missing the \\"big moment\\"  Overall, A Memory of Light was not unpleasant to read, but I'm glad that this series is done and I can move on to something else.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Game is fast paced cause the main character runs the whole time.  Simple to understand.  You just have to collect the silver bars and complete the stage.  Good for kids and adults.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|A great treatment of Oscar Wilde's &#34;Lady Windemeres Fan&#34;. Helen Hunt was excellent as the gold digger with a heart of gold. The movie was worth watching for the beautiful scenery of the Amalfi Coast and the great costuming and authentic feeling of the period.
B00BP4W3WI|5.0|We watched this movie as a family and loved it!  It's a classic.  It came through beautifully on our TV.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the coolest website I've found yet.  If you have a specific need - a recipe, party idea, or homeopathic remedy - you just search it and tons of ideas pop up.  The only problem is that the next thing you know, it's 3 hours later and you cannot stop looking at all the fabulous fashions, crafts and ideas!!!
0894803123|5.0|I have used this many times, and won awards in my neighborhood ice cream contest. Recipes are simple and delicious.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|This was  a great live animation movie the price was great and i received iit in a very fast time .I am also very happy with the condition that it came to me in.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|We thought this movie was well done and enjoyed it. The actors did a great job and the sensation was one of being in these characters shoes. It was emotional but had a good ending.
B000FC13MM|5.0|A very complex fantasy that is new in the 21st C; quite an amazing feat in a society that thinks there is nothing new. Nicely written and challenging to second guess.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Very funny flick, must watch with your significant other...  Didn't think I would like it but turned out funnier than I expected.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I have to say the writing in the first person was interesting, but the whole book was just so depressing.  What a time to be alive and a woman.  Glad I didn't live during those times.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|When my car was totaled and I left my copy of this CD in the wreck, I actually went out and bought it again. Only time I've bought the same CD twice.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|My Daughter and I loved this movie! It's a great love story with lots of twists and turns and ends with a surprise ending that we really enjoyed!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The story of a young man after a traumatic brain injury<br />Trying to reinvent himself for the woman he loves<br />How he grows and what he does after learning you can't<br />Go back
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|It's on my top ten. Very good movie. I enjoy this movie more than the first. Awesome movie. I would love to go back to the theater and watch it again.
B004P8A7J2|1.0|The story is simple. The imagery is intense. But the story moves so slowly that I lost interest. I decided to watch this movie because it was so highly rated on several websites. I was severely disappointed.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|In one word: Sobering. Still, this word seldom qualifies to express the depth, in meaning of a movie as such. Sadly, fewer words can express the greatness of. The small que's to which Adrian Brody act so well, drive the point to an extent unmatched by any movie: Schindler's list is near, and yet still falls so far. There is no greater comparison to encompass the vastness of what is, the holocaust.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Nice revenge movie although Butler gets a little crazy he and Foxx play really well off each other good all around fun!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|While having some medical jargon, this book has the right combination to still keep it interesting to the average reader. This is a great read.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Love the movie, love the characters and all of their issues.  Can't wait for pt. 2 There has to be a happy ending for Thor and Jane!
B0098A1TEE|5.0|Caro's Music is so fun and different. I am obsessed. very energizing and sultry all at once. I wish she would tour america.
0441172717|5.0|I first came across this book at my city library by chance. I've loved it ever since! Now that I own it, it makes it all the better. It truly lives up to the title of 'Science Fictions Supreme Masterpiece'. One cannot ask for more! I Highly recommend reading this book and the series.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Plenty good! - if you get to watch as this musical plays. This is the movie that established Liza Minnelli as an all-round actress and performer. It is the movie that established Bob Fosse as a world class director and it is the movie that brought the movie musical into the world of serious drama.  None of these facts are just my humble opinion. Any one of these facts justifies 5 stars.<br />You want this movie, and you will want to play this movie often.<br /><br />Loosely based on the Christopher Isherwood Berlin Stories, Cabaret tells the story of the infamously degenerate cabaret style of Weimar Germany in its last years before the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party. We are meant to see the lives of several people from the viewpoint of the mostly passive British visitor/English teacher ,  Brian Roberts (Michael York) however songstress, \\"Zenzation\\" Sally Bowles as played by Liza Minnelli dominates her every scene. Every scene except those she shares when on the stage with the Master of Ceremonies Joel Grey.<br /><br />This movie is worth a long analysis. It is even better with the added sections about the making of and the back stage story -something I rarely view much less recommend. You should be advised to pay extra attention to the Cabaret Girls, you have never seen their like before. You should get paragraphs about the genius that has the movie overlapping between the cabaret life of dancing, money and cross dressing bar girls against the growing horror that will be Nazi Germany. There are too many things for just this review even knowing there are many others here detailing many of the same points.<br /><br />Instead, get the movie; share it with people you respect. Watch and learn for yourself. There is too much to see in one or a few showings. This is entertainment, but it is so much more than a movie musical.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is even better than Hunger Games.  I rally couldn't put it down.  I can't so to read the last book except then the series will be over and I want to know what happens to all of the characters beyond this series.  What twists and turns.  You don't know who to believe or trust.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the very best weather information for the Android - do not bother looking anywhere else - it is clear and accurate
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season has the usual twists and turns.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  Plus, I just couldn't stop watching it!  I actually finished it in 2 days with a few late nights.  This season really focuses on Dexter and Debra's ever changing relationship.  My only disappointment is that I have to wait to watch season 8.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|they have the greatest blues rock sound. their lyrics are cool too, as most of there songs tell a story and are not just random thoughts just strung into a song. if you love this albums bluesey roots, check out the rest of their stuff. Its all good.
B007PVHANM|5.0|What can I say about Bob Marley? INSPIRING! This DVD has so much content about Bob's life that I did not know. Apart from recounting his life and career, the track selection for this movie was amazing! A must have for any Bob Marley fan or anyone interested in Reggae.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I ordered this book because I read a preview and got hooked. Unfortunately, I ordered too many books and haven't finished reading any of them! LOL the author writes beatifully and puts a lot of emotion into her words. You can feel this story, very intense.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's not that long but the graphics are beautiful.  The puzzles range from easy to really tough.  Play lasts longer if you don't use the hints.  Challenging and fun.  I started out playing text adventure games and now play the latest ps3 games but it's nice to kick back and relax with a game boy focused on speed.
B004LUS390|5.0|You can have many different layers of drawings. So you can have a picture as a layer then trace it on another layer and color on another. You can make any one of the layers invisible by clicking the eye next to it.  You can choose all your colors during the wheel or saved Colorado an eye dropper thing that means you can copy colors, that is not in the free version..  There are more brush options than the free version. (The free version is fantastic too)  this app takes about five minutes to get used to during and then you are set.  I am an artist and I love it. Worth buying!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read (more like \\"devoured\\") every Sookie Stackhouse  book since the very first one, and I love  the ending of this book!  's. Harris you did the characters' proud.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Enjoyed the fresh take on the zombie genre.  It will be interesting to see how the movie will do this book justice.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not bad but not a good ending to a great series. If you've read the series at least she can't make it worse.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I tried to fall asleep to the sounds which I relax to, but found the repitition a bit annoying. The loops are too short. Additionally I tried using the relaxing reverb sounds to goto sleep but having to wake up and physically change to deep sleep patterns didn't work. I did find that the meditation sounds did revive me, in some cases better then a &quot;5hour energy&quot; did. I get frequent breajs because of the type of work I do and the meditation sounds coupled with a 15 minute break do wonders for me.<br />One thing I wish was in this program would be hypnotic suggestion options. Help smokers to stop... over-eaters to slim down... or similar options.<br />The fact that I am saving money with the unneeded energy shots is what boosted my rating. Otherwise would sit at a 2.
B004LUHQ1G|2.0|Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace was a step in the right direction.  This is not.  \\"Walk\\" might be the worst song of their career.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|It is no better than any of the free photo editing apps. In fact I think many of the free ones are better.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Jane Eyre is a well written TAle of an idealized yet reality  filled adventure of a wellbeing yet penniless girl .for the 21st century reader especially a female reader may find this stirring and tedious, when in fact this is how it was in the 1700and 1800  Times Bronte,s life is also worth exploring she writing almost in biography here in  Jane Eyre  Don,t let your 21st century ideas obscure this book for you. Enjoy
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I Still love it as much as ever. Can't wait for season 6. hope his dad will come back again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written murder mystery with solid characters.  Kept my interest from beginning to end. WITHOUT giving away their end, I must say that I am disappointed in the conclusion.  IT was not satisfying.
B00CNZ17DO|3.0|i like the album, but i believe it is the weakest album of the three. my biggest gripe is that the album is to repetitive. the best song on the album is ready to rock, i like how they reinvented it but the song itself is 10 years old, my point being the band seems to be struggling to find what they had in runnin wild, i dont think they will ever match that album. there are some good tracks on this album but to many repetitive filler songs.
B004ZN9ERI|1.0|This is not a \\"masterpiece\\" or a \\"classic\\" or whatever else you want to call it.  It's a group of young men clumsily jamming while under the influence of psychedelic drugs.  That works for some groups, but not this one.  The last four \\"songs\\" in particular are an absolute chore to listen to.  Granted, Astronomy Domin&eacute; is a good song but it doesn't justify purchasing the album because you can just listen to Voivod's version instead.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|I am not sure what the message is. If it is men and women are the same that is ridiculous- yes they are equal yet have important differences. I find the lessons stated in the book a bit obvious and the story itself not too compelling. I admire her and love her achievements yet didn't love the book.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Ho hum.....not much drama, predictable events and outcome.  Not much reason to watch aside from a few good scens from Wahlberg.  Crowe was almost in a different language with his mumbles and such......so perhaps what he had to say but went unheard would have made this a bit better but I doubt it.....
B005COO1X6|5.0|Liked this King short story.  I have  been a fan since I read the  Stand in 5th grade in 1982, so I guess I'm biased.  Very simple and crazy idea, an  it works.  I would love to see a movie of 4 or 5 of Steve's short stories it could be so good if done right!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I recently picked up Guild Wars 2 and found that couldn't get by with my old MMO playstyle (yes, I am a lifetime clicker with few, if any, keybinds).  GW2 is just too hectic for my attention to be constantly focused on where I am clicking.  If they would allow for customizable actions bars, things might be different, but they don't, so I needed another solution.<br /><br />My issue with keybinds is that I'm not very good at continuing to move while using skills mapped around the WASD keys.  I needed something that would relieve me of the need to use WASD for movement so that I could concentrate on skills.  I went for the G13 because it seemed like the best fit and had a few more programmable keys than the Razer Nostromo.  Using the ESDF or RDFG keys for movement instead of the WASD keys may provide most of the same functionality, but I'd still be left with the same issue I had - I really don't like using four keys which are great for important skills for movement.<br /><br />In that regard, the G13 is great.  Using the joystick for movement frees up my index, middle and ring finger for using skills and lets my thumb do something more than hit the space bar.  I was also a long-time console gamer, so I am used to using my left thumb to move my character, so this setup actually feels more natural. The joystick can also be used to activate skills (each direction can be a different action) if you still want to use the main keys for movement.<br /><br />On the build quality, this is clearly a Logitech product as it is solidly built and exudes quality.  The keys seem like they will hold up to marathon gaming sessions for years to come.  The wrist pad is not very paddy, but it is comfortable and at the right angle for my hand.<br /><br />My main gripe with the G13 is that it is not the perfect size for my mid-sized hand.  I would like it if the G13 were a bit larger to give my hand a bit more space to stretch out.  I think a future version of this product could try to incorporate some kind of slide and latch system that would allow users to customize the dimensions a bit - basically allow us to move the keys and joystick a bit farther away from the wrist pad.<br /><br />As I said, the keys are solid.  They are well spaced and most are easy to reach.  My only real issue with the keys is that the main ones in the middle depressions in them.  I think it would be easier to re-center my hand if the middle key (G11) had a bump instead.  I don't know if that would get uncomfortable after a while though.  As it is, it works, and I'll probably get used to it.<br /><br />The joystick works very well for me.  Others have complained about it, but I don't really have any complaints.  It is responsive, easy to use and I haven't found its shape or design to be annoying or uncomfortable.  There are plenty of web posting showing how to replace the stock joystick with another one, so if you don't like the look of it, just change it out.  Like others have said though, it is really hard to press it down, so I don't have that bound to anything important.<br /><br />The software is easy to use and has built in profiles for most major games.  As soon as I plugged it in and installed the software, the G13 scanned my system and found all compatible games and asked me if I wanted to download profiles for them, which I did.  When you do that, it makes keybinding a lot easier since the software gives you a scrollable list of all the possible keybinds in the game labeled for what they do, e.g. &#34;jump,&#34; &#34;dodge,&#34; &#34;open map&#34; instead of the corresponding keys on the keyboard (space, v and m). So, instead of binding the G14 key to the spacebar for jump, you can just drag and drop the jump command over the G14 key and it is bound.  No need to remember exactly which key does what in game, just drop the command you want on the key you want and it is all set.<br /><br />The LCD screen is an interesting addition, but not really all that useful.  It either provides information that isn't all the useful in the heat of battle since you can't really be watching it or provides interesting, but distracting information.  For example, it has an RSS newsfeed that was showing different headlines for me last night.  Interesting, but not something I should be watching when I'm trying to run a dungeon.  It has other information like CPU temp as well as in-game information.  For Guild Wars 2, it will tell you how you are doing on map completion and what your  stats (strength, precision, etc) are at the moment.  Again, it is interesting, but not that useful at any given moment.  I've mostly left it with the backlight off since I don't use it.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the G13 after a few hours with it.  I'm still getting used to using keybinds in general, but that's not the G13's fault.  A lot of practice will make all of that second nature.  I'd recommend the G13 to just about anyone looking to gain more freedom in the way they setup keybinds.  Just be sure to get it on sale, as I think $80 is a bit steep.  $50-$60 is a much better price range.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good graphics and easy to play, this game is a great way to pass some time. A lot of fun, and kind of addicting.
0062238868|5.0|I just finished this book, and all I can say is: Chris Kyle was an awesome American! I loved the stories that he shared of his OPs overseas fighting for the people in the region, and his sharing of life as a SEAL, to his sharing of very personal experiences with friends lost in the war and issues with war and family. Too bad that moron had to take a life that meant so much to his wife, kids and family and brothers. I can't wait for his new book to be finished by Taya!
B008602KQI|4.0|It was entertaining & stayed to the book better than most. I enjoyed it! If you enjoyed the read then you will definitely like the film.
B004132HZS|5.0|When this first came out on PBS, I reluctantly watched assuming I would turn it off after 15 minutes. I didn't like the other SH versions or the books particularily. But this was great!!! The characters are great, expecially Watson although Sherlock and Mycroft are exceptional as well, I guess I should have expected this of the resurrectors of Doctor Who. Can't wait for season three.
B000JWTX3Y|3.0|Second time I have seen this. It's predictable to some degree but cute if you like Chris or Lindsay. I've always been a fan of her as an actress and musician. Chris is just adorable and does well with Lindsay in this. Worth a rent.
B000Q9ISSQ|3.0|Interesting glimpse of Australia's terrain. However, I didn't think the book was as &#34;entertaining&#34; (e.g.) as some of his others<br />in terms of his subtle humor.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|I am hoping Simply Red gets back Touring Again. The DVD is so great to have in your Music Collection
B005544TRQ|5.0|I can't believe I have missed watching this show. I am on a Suits Marathon right now!  Love the show!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|Quick read, but predictable and the writing is sub-par. I am not sure why this is part of a trilogy...it's short.
B0000025T6|4.0|I bought this album when it first came out 30 years ago and at first the low production values bothered me. But after listening to this album over the years, those low production values made this a great album. Most of the songs are stark and the crack and distortion add greatly to those songs, especially on the title track. I was living in Lincoln at the time and was fascinated by the stories the older people told of that time when terror came to the heartland. Even cleaned up, it's still a good album. But to truely enjoy it you need to listen to the original vinyl release with all the glorious distortion.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I found this book to be Sexy,Tasteful and just enough Erotic to keep you wandering and wanting more. I have had the pleasure of meeting this poetic in person and watching him perform, so all while I was reading the imaging was there. I have never experience poetry this way and enjoyed every story, so I highly recommend this book.Ladies  pick this book up you will not be disappointed..  Real Divas Read Kim Washington/Hurd
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This is a rip off yes it is free but stupid I have to beat my iPad to make the app work
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Not as great as I thought they'd be but they're definitely worth the price. Sound quality is good and I love how it easily fits on anyone's head. I do not recommend this for anyone looking to get workout headphones though, as these are studio and will make your ears sweat like crazy if you workout in them. I am completely satisfied with these headphones.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This was a GREAT &#34;purchase.&#34;  I left my phone at the office and don't have a back up at home.  Stupid, I know.  I got this for my Kindle and fell in love.  It is a bit bright, but I just turned it around.  I love the options.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|What a great movie with great actors. They really blew this one out the water. The actors did an amazing job in all of their different roles. Would highly recommend.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The newest and best hungry shark. L o ve the graphics and the different shark species. Only wish the map was bigger. Some glitches when saving but otherwise fabulous time waster
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was great! It was captivating enough, however the ending left me wanting more. I recommend it as a good read!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|OHHHH yess THIS IS THE SET TO FIND OR THE BLU RAY SET. Cool extras good packaging tottally awesome set A+++
B0063GORYU|5.0|a wonderful way to spend my TIME!!!!!!! THX FOR THIS GAME!!!!! Hours of goodness and relaxation in my own time once again thank you for a wonderfully game!!!!!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|What's not to like?  If you use Yahoo, you NEED this app.  I have it on my Kindle and my Android.  I use it daily.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book started out slow and immediately got slower. Really shallow and probably the worst ending I've read in a long time. Do not waste your money, or time.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Love the book as I have all of the books, but I agree with other reviewers on both books 4 and 5. There is a huge wasteland of characters wandering around doing essentially nothing except filling pages with words, inter-spaced with some good character development and action.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|What a treat! I feel like a just took a vacation back in time to Vienna where I met some very interesting people. The characters were so well-developed it is hard not to think of them as real people. I liked Fischer's first novel very much,but for me this was even better. He takes such care with the dialogue and describes the scenes so well it played like a movie in my head. Well done Mr. Fischer! I look forward to the third book.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Interesting to read about a disaster from so many varied viewpoints.  This did make the story a bit disjointed but a good read nonetheless.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green's The Fault in our Stars was a very unique read. When I first heard the plot of the story before reading it, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. I'm not normally one for dark, sad, emotional books, especially in the Young Adult group. However I figured I'd give it a try, and I'm SO glad I did! Wow! The story of these two teenagers battling one of life's scariest scenarios is absolutely chilling. The most amazing part of this book, however, is not the terrifying idea of kids with cancer and how they deal with it. It's how light-hearted and fun the writing was, in spite of the dense topics. The book still made me laugh out loud, when I only expected to cry. This was absolutely phenomenal, I recommend it to everyone.
0345522303|5.0|This book may just be the best of the nightrunner series, though close tie with number 2.  Wonderful plot and characters and good to see alec and seregil having fun again.  Very absorbing fun read.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|it didn't take too long  to be delivered ,the pack was is made from really soft plastic (don't stack too many) one off my favorites .
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Like the book as I have all of the books, but I agree with other reviewers on both books 4 and 5. There is a huge wasteland of characters wandering around doing essentially nothing except filling pages with words, inter-spaced with some good character development and action.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This story was fantastic.  I love Katsa and would thoroughly enjoy reading more about her and Po again.  My only disappointments were that Katsa couldn't see herself with Po for the rest of their lives i.e., she discarded the option of marrying Po.  They're the perfect pair who accept each other unconditionally.  So what's the problem here?  Oh well.  Just because it didn't end happily like I wanted, it doesn't mean it still wasn't a fantastic book and a great read.  I may read this one again in the future.  Katsa's adventure is worth re-visiting.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love it! The colours are a great touch, the app is real easy to use. Also the app<br />Is easy to understand.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a phenomenal story - original idea, well-written, and the characters were unbelievably compelling! I absolutely COULD NOT put this book down! It tells the story of Katniss Everdeen, a poor hunter from District 12 and her selection as a tribute for the annual Hunger Games. The story is a roller coaster of events: Her relationship with Peeta Mellark, the other tribute from her district, her journey in the games, and her ultimate well-earned survival. I HIGHLY recommend this book to all age groups. It is a must read!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Great at first.  A big improvement over the original app on the kindle fire.  But, gets stuck a lot.  Overall has a few more options than the original. But needs to get the bugs worked out.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This film is an instant classic! It's an eye-opening story of the Civil Rights Movement through the eyes of colored maids, and the times of &#34;separate but equal&#34;. It will also make you laugh and cry! I really think that everyone should see this movie and take it's message to heart.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|A great poppy swing towards their style in Discovery, definitely worth every penny. Booklet seems like an added cost, but the songs are great regardless.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Too technical. It's like reading a text  book written especially for neurosurgeons, and that I'm not.  However, Dr. Alexander is a walking miracle.  His story is a message of hope and love straight from the Master.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is such a well done film, led by an amazing performance by Cate Blanchett in the title role. She should have won an Oscar (but, instead it was given to Gwenyth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love, which was a good performance but not as good as Blanchett.) She is supported by Geoffrey Rush, who also was great. I'll keep it short & sweet: If you want to see a great film with fantastic acting, watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it and how they always update to different countries... great stress reliever. Yet, I believe there should be more like a upgraded jetpack that can be bought or acquired through missions.. just a thought
B0064MGU98|5.0|This really keeps your attention. Fast pace with many situations and emotions going on at the same time. The story line is easy to relate to and makes you think. Have enjoyed very much.
B005LAII62|5.0|This film will warm the hearts of all members of the family! It teaches that being different is okay, and that acceptance is needed. It has a perfect mixture of laughs and awws! I highly recommend this movie, especially if you enjoyed Coraline!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read the series of books and liked all of them.  I am looking forward to the second movie.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really liked how everything was wrapped up in this final book of the series.  Have a good life, Sookie!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really like this game.It challenge s you. I never get tired of it because there are so many  to choose from.
1423113462|5.0|After the successful release of &#34;Percy Jackson & the Olympians&#34; series, Riordan returns to the same universe in a whole new way.  Instead of having Percy as the main narrator, we finally get behind the eyes of three new characters.  With Jason, Piper, and Leo this story takes flight for a whole new adventure and a whole new villain.<br /><br />Rick Riordan never fails to keep the fans emotionally invested into his books!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I thought the book tied everything up nicely and I was happy to see Sookie with Sam. It was great.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|An amazing family movie! It is fun for all ages and will make you laugh and cry. The message behind the story is one of acceptance and coming together, and I believe it could really help some children learn, as well as pull at adults heart-strings! This movie will go down as a Tim Burton classic!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I'm not a big fiction reader; One or two fiction books per year if any.  I think this book may have changed that.  This really captured my imagination and kept me turning pages wanting to know what, or who, was next.  I think this will appeal to readers of all ages and interests. There's even a lesson or two to be learned about life, love and friendship.  I would absolutely recommend this book.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I like this story, it's an intriguing storyline.  It's not a difficult read, keeps my attention...I like Christian Gray, the main character.  He's rich powerful and in control.  Twists and turns in the plot.  A little heavy handed with all the detailed dialogue around every single amorous action.  Nothing mundane in the reality these characters are living in...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very easy to use and quite dependable. It supports multiple alarms, repeating and non repeating alarms, and allows control of alarm style and volume.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King never fails to deliver a fright to the readers.  If you thought clowns were just funny or boring, then you have not met &#34;It&#34; before.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|Great if you like romantic comedies.  Interesting juxtaposition between today and the past.  I would actually rate it 4-1/2 stars if I could.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Love Letter arrived in the mail one lazy afternoon, and my wife and I decided to play it immediately. We immediately played three consecutive games, and plan on playing many more.<br /><br />The 16 cards are well balanced in terms of their effects. Holding the highest card is not always the best plan, and often you will win a round thanks to one of the lower valued cards.<br /><br />It doesn't take very long to play the game, with our games averaging 20-25 minutes with two players once we got the hang of the rules.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the cards are a little flimsy, causing me to put them in protective sleeves (not included) right away. If you were to play without sleeves, I fear an  accidental fold could easily &#34;mark&#34; one or more of the cards.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Cliff hanger! How could it just end like that!!!! Can't wait till I can get my hands on mocking Jay
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book is actually quite a bit different than the first book.  Where the first book was highly focused on the moral and ethical implications of children and war (along with other foci); this book is more of telling &#34;the rest of the story.&#34;  Where the first book was more of a military sci fi book; this one is more of a sci fi with a bit of fantasy thrown in.  This second book (along with the next two in the series) is also a &#34;thinking book.&#34;  If you like science fiction mixed with philosophy, you'll like this book; if not, then skip it.  It is quite a bit different from the first book; and the final two in the series continue on in this vein.  Overall, I loved it, as I enjoy both military sci fi and philisophical books (such as the Hyperion series).
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The technique used to tell this story or series of stories was to interweave all the stories.  I would have preferred the technique used in the book that allowed you to get into each story and allowed the viewer to do their own interweaving.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|this is a fantastic book and a great collection. it is a very enjoyable book which i can not put down!
B00846REIS|4.0|Very similar to 50 shades...just not as dark. Expected a little more. Enjoyed reading. Looking forward to reading the sequel.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I just hope that the Movie is closer to the book. I very much enjoyed this book. Not so sure I liked the end, but it did well for the third book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the best!! I can not stop playing it sometimes. I enjoy this app a lot and recommend it to you!!!!!! ;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|This story was so great and so awful!  And so realistic in some regards...Today many of our children are playing virtual games for several hours a day.  How does this relate to our future (that's all I'm going to say as I do not want to spoil this book)?  I love military science fiction, and this is excellent!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Action packed and funny....not realistic....but it's entertaining. If you are looking for some good entertainment without having to think too much....this is the movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Being a fan of Jillian's other workout DVDs (I own \\"Ripped in 30\\" & \\"6 Week Six-Pack\\") I thought this would be a good addition to the collection & I couldn't beat the price ($7 on amazon.ca).<br /><br />The DVD: It works great, no issues there. As always, it has an easy-to-use menu, which I know anyone who uses her DVDs appreciates this, especially when you want to get straight to your workout without any hassle.<br /><br />The Workouts: I love both all 3 levels, they get the blood flowing & heart rate going. Jillian has you work on different muscle groups than \\"Ripped in 30\\" & \\"6 Week Six-Pack\\" it's a nice change of pace. These are tough workouts but it's worth it. I love how positive Jillian is throughout the entire workout as well. I personally like to do Level 1, 2 or 3 from \\"30 Day Shred\\" & then one from \\"6 Week Six-Pack\\"; the two combined are amazing & sure to get results fast. These workouts will come in handy during the winter when it's dark, raining & snowing because Jillian has you do cardio & strength. In my opinion, I much prefer this to \\"Ripped in 30\\".<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommend for fans of Jillian & anyone looking to get toned fast. \\"30 Day Shred\\" & \\"6 Week Six-Pack\\" are my favorites!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Alice in wonderland is one of my favorite stories (and movies) growing up. Full of animation and wonder and straight up &#34;craziness.&#34; Watching it now as an adult, I remember just how trippy the movie really is; but as with all things, I now am able to pick up on innuendos and jokes I missed as a kid.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I thought I had ordered a vinyl but then I realize it was my fault that I ordered the cd, just careful with that, but it delivered very fast and in great condition!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I get hours of fun. I would recommend to my friends. Can't wait for another one.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|A great way to relive the Jurassic Park movies. Most of the usual characters are back and the game play is not repetitive.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome, fun & addictive. My daughter and I can hardley put it down. So far I don't have any cons to report.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Everyone who loves music should watch this! I went out after seeing it and bought his CD's! Three more words required by Amazon
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have read the books and still can't see Tom Cruise play Reacher. It is a good. It makes me want to see more of Jack Reacher moves
B00004ZBVG|4.0|It played very well, and I enjoyed viewing movies again & again because there is always something I didn't catch before.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. plays Sherlock Holmes in this movie and his performance is incredible. This movie is fun to watch and Robert Downey Jr. plays his part very well. I recommend this buy!
B00BHU261S|5.0|We really enjoyed watching Hitchcock and finding out about the collaboration between Alma and Hitchcock.  Since I watched Psycho when it was first released (and screamed during many scenes) it was interesting to see what it took to get it made and released.
B0015ABRE2|3.0|Purchased as a gift for someone who says it is as expected. He just had missed some episodes and wanted them on video. Not sure why a review is necessary--pretty self-explanatory.
B00786XVOG|3.0|I thought this concert would have some new music but it is a re-hash of previous concerts, which frankly were better than this.  I'm a die-hard fan and if you are too, this is probably a waste of money.  If you are new to Yanni then it would be a good introduction to his music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This one was a little hard to keep track of, but once the parts came of them at war I found myself not putting the book down. All 3 books are excellent.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game so much. It's so FUN. I have no problems , the b only thing I have to say is that I don't like when the vehicle flips so much. Other than that I would totally recommend this game to everyone!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great work Max!  I'm reminded of some of my favorite science fiction novels like Rendezvous with Rama and the Andromeda Strain.  The structure and compelling characters allowed me to suspend disbelief and immerse myself in another world.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This was a fun game, and didn't take a lot of brain power, but I didn't like having to purchase extra pearls.  I did purchase a few extras, but when I got to level 16 or so, it got boring and not as many quests as in the beginning.  I was also getting tired of spending my pearls on extremely rare plants only to have them not attract new rare fish!  I deleted it, sorry!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really? What self-respecting women would allow herself to be treated like this? &#34;Turn around I am going to f--- you hard&#34; Oh spare me. A dressed up dime store novel - pretty, naive women who loses her virginity to a very rich gorgeous man who spends tons of money on her and can snap his fingers to have people jump. Classic cheap romantic novel decked out with sado-masochism. Guess that is the new sex in the 21st century. The female lead's character (so bad I cannot remember her name) had one favorite word, &#34;crap&#34; or &#34;holy crap&#34;.  Who says that? Silly book and a waste of time.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I actually liked it. Anthony Hopkins did a great job as Alfred Hitchcock and the plot line was pretty interesting, too. It was just good entertainment with an interesting perspective on his wife and the collaboration.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it. runs good. switches up how to look for the items. maybe make it more difficult. but il
B006MW3UZW|5.0|At first I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about and watched Season 1. Piqued my interest but was slow to develop. However Season 2 got me hooked. The characters' personalities really came to life and the situations they found themselves in left me anxious to see the next episode! On my Kindle Fire, the sound and picture were excellent. Can't wait for Season 3!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Gives a small inside look at those with mental illness. Shows some of the struggles that can be faced, like whether or not to take meds (side effects), establishing relationships, others perceptions of people who have to go to therapy or who have been to a mental institution.<br />It had funny moments and moments that made you take a step back. I love Robert de Niro in any movie. Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence did a great job and complimented each ither well. I would recommend for others to watch this.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I have been raving about this book to anyone who would listen !!!!!! the most delightful book I have read in ages.  Char Duffy
0865479410|5.0|The author takes a look at various practices both spiritual and temporal that do not rely on &#34;positive thinking&#34; or Pollyanna -ish optimism to get through life.  He examines various ancient and some modern approaches to attitude and one's general outlook on life.<br /><br />I have been a consumer of the personal development genre - CDs, DVDs, MP3s, live seminars, coaching - for decades and, to be very blunt, I have come to believe it's a bunch of mumbo jumbo promoted by modern day snake oil salesmen.  This book provides a welcome alternative perspective.<br /><br />Read it!
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|It's was an amazing book!! Read it during this summer I think I will always remember this book. It was so good.
B009NY43NY|3.0|With the ending of the last book, this ending was what I expected. I looked forward to seeing how the series would end and am glad it had a &#34;conclusion&#34;, but I was disappointed in how things ended.  I felt the book fell a bit flat with all the love that supposedly Eric and Sookie felt for each other and was dismissed so easily like a business transaction.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm still not sure how Amazon.com found this book for me, but while I was looking for a new book to read this one was suggested for me. Days before, I had recently lost someone very close to me in my family, and (am still) struggling with it. I think this book found me, call it Divine intervention. I too am in the medical profession and struggle with my own personal beliefs and those which I am taught from the scientific community. This book really made me feel at ease with some of the unexplainable events I have seen in my life, those which science cannot explain.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, IT IS WELL WRITTEN and the story keeps your attention to the very end, an unusual angle of a murder mystery ad a very interesting one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Easy app to use and lots of options for level to keep you challenged.  Great little way to give yourself a mental break, and the graphics are beautiful.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Good price for a great season.  (I bought this is a gift for a friend but I will probably buy myself a copy, too.)
B0049J2CKE|5.0|It is funny to watch, your child will enjoy it and the grown people as well, I'll definitely recommend this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This toy is awesome for fans of minecraft.  Love the small peices.  Alot of peices for the price.<br /><br />Do not buy if you are expecting normal size legos.
1572814136|5.0|The cards arrived on time and were exactly as described. I wish that the original creators of the Radiant deck had designed the cards to not have english on them, though, because I think it takes away from the mystique of the paintings. But the cards came brand new, in perfect condition, wrapped well, and I've had a lot of fun with them!!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I love the new album. Takes me on a whole new adventure. Mature in a sense that relationships have grown and gone. Will continue to live and learn!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Charges my nexus 10 a little faster. I really like the magnetic clips because I don't have to worry about damaging my power connector.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game! I can kill hours playing. I play on my iPhone 4s and Kindle Fire HD. If I had one complaint it is that I can't save my progress so I can play on either device and not have to have two separate games going. Keep creating new vehicles and levels.
1878424505|5.0|This is my second reading of the Four Agreements.  It resonated with me immensely the first time so I bought my own copy.  The help given in this material is delivered simply and powerfully.  In my case, it has helped me cut through the flack and noise in my life to be able to see a little better a clearer path to letting go of things, life patterns, karma, personal stuff to get to the points that will help move one on his or her way.  It seems to me, only good can come from this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great family game , fun and makes you think very chanlgeing puzzles . i love playing this game  and help the kids with the levals.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|This is my first book from this author.  It may be hers I don't know.  I read it because a friend liked it.  I really had a negative attitude towards it.  This is usually not my type of book .  But I found it rewarding reading and became interested in the characters lives.  She writes well and spends a plausible story where none should exist
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never laughed so hard and been so turned on at the same time.  Well done Ms. Chase, you made my day (which is how long it took me to read this treasure because I.Could.Not.Stop!)<br /><br />Can't wait to read more from you. This is my first ever book review, and I read a lot!  This one was worth me stopping by to thank you for genius. More please?
B002LU0E26|3.0|I found this movie a bit slow. My son loves superhero movies but he did not care to finish this one.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|It's tough to say because I am a huge Mike Portnoy fan, but this is DT's best music yet.  Too bad they waited until Mike left to make it.....<br /><br />If you like DT at all BUY THIS - it rocks!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I loved the book. James Burke's writing is haunting with its lush descriptions and insights into human nature. I think this translated well to the screen. I liked that the movie stayed so true to the book, and the actor who played the general was spot on. Great casting throughout in fact. John Goodman and Tommy Lee Jones were excellent. I'll watch it again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|very easy to read and easy to access.<br />works really great on my device, and I am very satisfied with the application
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful book, sad and poignant. Mr. Hosseini is an amazing writer and he draws you into the book immediately. Intricate story line but he pulls you through it flawlessly. I recommend this and his other books to anyone who loves a superb story
B0091XT8F0|5.0|Great songs, amazing dancing, funny, entertaining, silly and visually stunning! One of my all time favorites--one of nearly everybody's all time favorites!
B00BZODDYU|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie to be a good scary movie. Its just a little creepy but still good.
B00821OX98|2.0|very predictable and formulaic, tried watching a few episodes, but it just does not make the cut. Part pf the current &#34;aliens invade- we must survive genre&#34;, but with little inspiration, frankly tedious
B001ENS0BI|4.0|Entertaining, not as good as season 1 but better than 2+3. A surprising but fitting end; you will be on  edge till its over.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This was a pretty tame book and basically just wrapped up loose ends in the exact manner you'd assume. No surprises, nothing awesome, very predictable.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game ! I get to build a city.<br /> This game is fun and I play it all the time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I live this game the colors the skate broad the cop chaseing u through the game the different people in the games
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|I literally laughed at every page. It's a great little funny read! I've been a victim of autocorrect fail a time of two myself, and this just proves I'm not alone! Highly recommend
1938469003|5.0|Great book.  First half is an amazing history of brewing ales.  Next quarter gives a good overview of various techniques used through time for brewing.  Last quarter gives recipes and insight from brewers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's a great mind game as well as relaxing. I need it to pass the time and stimulate the brain. Good fun!
B00846REIS|5.0|It is very rare that I will give 5 stars, but this one deserves it.  I was told this book is like 50 Shades and I couldn't disagree more.  I really disliked this book, but this was had you pulled in and captivated from the start.  I loved everything about this book, the emotion, the relationships and the level of intimacy that was reached with just words was awesome.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It provided hours of entertainment. Very interactive and user friendly. Can't wait to play the sequel!
B008CX2A2I|5.0|This makes life LOTS easier! Easily connects to the other devices AKA MP3 Players, Cell Phone ETC! If you get the Onkyo this is just a No Brainer! Why wouldn't you get the extra connectivity for your system? It takes up a slot but can easily be removed so... Anyway I dig it!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Watched season one when HBO had a week of free access, had to buy season two to follow the story, now will have to buy season three, when it becomes available!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series just gets better and better.  In this second book, you find the lengths that Gideon will go to keep Eva safe, even at the cost of his fame, fortune and freedom.  There was much more pain and angst in this book, but I thought it was written beautifully and in a way that you can't help but feel something for both of them and what they are going through.
B005VMSATA|4.0|i injoyed it and would use the service again if i need something to watch while at the hospital waiting
B00CE03UOC|4.0|A very fun PUZZLE game . Lots of levels to go through.  Have played several levels so far. Puzzles get gradually more difficult.
B00008BRDX|5.0|There is not much to say, it is 'The Police'.  I am an '80s kid and they are icons of the era.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Compelling story telling and interesting characters make this one of the best books I've read all year. Don't underestimate Brooks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing app. All of my friends had this and were begging me to get it, but I didn't have the money until I got 500 coins and got it free! You will be pleased if you buy this app.  Survival mode is really creepy.  There are giant spiders and zombies and other wired things that can take your life.  GET THIS APP IT IS WORTH IT AND ADDICTING!
0670023329|4.0|I think this kind of deal would help people who would like to read books with cheaper cost. Thank you
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great for math homework. This app isn't to fancy, just a normal calculator you would use on a regular bases.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This I s a great blend of science fiction and westerns. Great characters and good plots.<br /><br />Fun to watch. Unfortuneatly it went if the air after its first year.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Great story line, graphics, full of action and suspense.  I would recomend this movie to my friends and family.  This is a must see.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It works very well and does exactly what it is suppose to due, thermally transfers heat while making a seal or bond if you will<br />between fan and heatsink....a very good product....I recommend it.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I almost like this app more than the original. I was so exited when this app came out. I have done all the boxes in the original one and I can't wait to start these!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|There are very few artists who can keep my full attention for a whole night, but Lindsey Stirling is one of them. I've never heard anything like it. The electronic aspects are not overdone and the melodies are beautiful and exciting. I highly recommend this album.
B006M4F67A|3.0|It is fun to play and I enjoyed it. I will keep this game on my kindle, but one of these games is enough.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very well written work.  An enjoyable read, though character count is large and relationships a bit complicated.  I particularly loved the Sansa, Daenerys and Tyrion chapters of the tale.  The Bran chapters, I have to admit, I found rather boring.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Though I didn't remember some of the scenes presented from my memory of reading the book, I truly enjoyed this interpretation.  I look forward to the next two movies.  I love the actor portraying Bilbo.  To me, he is perfect for the part.  As I re-read the book, I will have a nice visual image of the characters.  Well done, Mr. Jackson.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Like the fact that it was clear so it still looks like my phone.  My only problem was with the screen protector - could not get all the air bubbles out of it no matter what I tried.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played.It's almost better than any other game I ever played on the kindle fire.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I got this first for ds then it came for kindle if only it was for samsung but I gave 5 stars anyway
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Don't get me wrong I love subway surfers but to be honest the app store has to step it's game I mean I can't even download fun run
B001EBWIRW|5.0|Love this movie I will use this again soon. Love this service. I logged in on my smart tv. Thanks
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Whenever i rent a movie, the instant viewing always stops working and i can't watch the movie anymore. Very unimpressed. Not buying movies from here any longer.x
B005F9CPG8|5.0|What more needs to be said?  Twenty-seven number 1 hits with 79+1/4 minutes of music on a single CD, and in chronological order, as they should be.  The packaging includes a great booklet with close to no text -- a one-page introduction by George Martin and a page of recording credits -- but beautiful reproductions of 45 rpm (single) record sleeves.  It even includes the wonderful Richard Avedon photos.  It's exciting, it's exhilarating and it brings back a lifetime of memories.  As others have commented, it only includes A sides and no B sides.  Penny Lane without Strawberry Fields?  Hey Jude without Revolution?  Well, I suppose that some compromises needed to be made to fit as much music on the CD as is there.  If you don't already have this then get it and learn to live.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|The game kept freezing up my kindle. I had to delete it from kindle.  Will not download it again ever.
B000YAA68W|5.0|An artfully animated history lesson told through the eyes of an adolescent Iraqi girl.  It's a story we all should hear.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked the story, and I liked the writing.  This is a first novel, and  I look forward to reading more from this young author.

B0013D8LCW|2.0|somewhat mediocre film seen better.<br />you never know exactly how a film will appeal if you have never heard of the title but there are better films out there and the background is rather depressing too.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun SIM. Difficult to put down.  There's always some thing to look forward to and try.  Graphics are okay, but goals are what keeps you going.<br /><br />.
B00C061I3K|5.0|i had to buy this on amazon's site to keep it @ #1.  i just recently discovered daft punk over on billboard and itunes and decided to check out their album on youtube.  talk about going back in time to the late 70s and 80s.  i was feeling the eagles 'hotel california' vibes on some of the songs.  this album is the perfect album to relax and groove to.  i just can't get over how good the whole album is and how addicting it is!!<br /><br />here are my fave tracks so far: doin' it right [i absolutely love that song!!  no doubt this will be a #1 smash on the hot 100!!] fragments of time [reminds me of three's company, or roller skating back in the 80s to some good, fun music!!], get lucky, lose yourself to dance [hotttt song!!], instant crush, motherboard.<br /><br />to those of you who aren't feeling the album, i say give it a couple more listens, esp. driving home from work or riding the bus.  talk about putting you in a good mood!!  great album and congrats to daft punk for their 1st #1 album here in the u.s.!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I truly enjoyed the first 9 books of this series.  But you could really tell that the author lost interest in this series after that.<br />I can only hope that she left so many open story lines that she may decide to come back to it some day. Maybe  once the pressure of publishers and Tv execs subsides.
0670014893|4.0|This book is another of the author's compelling, if not murky, novels involving clandestine dealings with dubious outcomes. Of course, one of the reasons to read le Carre, that is, experiencing the British essence, permeates the book: the cryptic dialog where statements are questions, and questions statements; the good-ole-boy, upper-class stilted mannerisms; dark, foreboding landscapes; etc.<br /><br />The unassuming, loyal bureaucrat - a stock-in-trade for the author - in this book is \\"Kit\\" Probyn, aka Paul Anderson, who has been selected to monitor an off-the-books capture of an arm's merchant - that is, be the eyes and ears of a minister in the Foreign Office. Though the operation is over so quickly that Kit can only accept the official version that it was a success, three years later, well into retirement as a country gentleman, Kit is confronted by a special forces participant who is obviously troubled by collateral damage swept under the proverbial rug. However, it is Kit's wife Suzanne, who goads him into reopening that chapter in his life.<br /><br />Toby Bell, the minister's private secretary at the time, has lived with the knowledge that this operation was conducted outside the bounds of legality, let alone any collateral damage. Even those he trusted were indifferent to the primary role being played by a US-based private security firm not subject to the same constraints as the British military.<br /><br />The pace of the book picks up considerably in its second half as Kit and Toby conduct seat-of-the-pants investigations of the operation that run into bureaucratic stone-walling, hostile interviewees, and hardball tactics. They are dedicated, even courageous, but the author is really asking whether truth can be permitted when so much is at stake for giant bureaucracies and entities and their directors.

1451695195|5.0|Great book.  Bought it and sent to several friends and relatives.  I would highly recommend it.  Gives you a lot to think about.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great movie for the whole family.  I would totally recommend it to anyone with little ones.  Both the 2 and 6 year old loved it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Like the other games in the franchise, a winner! Spend too much time smashing pigs. Not a fan of buying the helps though.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|I had seen this years ago and I wanted to refresh my memory since the remake is out at the theatre.
030758836X|5.0|I found \\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn to be an extremely clever novel. Throughout the book, she takes you on twists and turns that keep you second guessing your assumptions the entire way! While I did not find any of the characters in the book to be likable, in fact, each one had series character flaws, and no visible moral fibers, it still made for very good reading.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|i kept waiting for the movie to really get going and then it was over. seemed more like episode 1 of a season rather than a whole movie. left me waiting for the climax that never came.

B008NEVPCC|5.0|Cher Lloyd must have been infused with a rambunctious personality at a young age because she has integrated that attitude into her music quite convincingly. She's got swag and she's not afraid to show it. One moment her audience is rocking along with Want U Back and the next moment she has reduced them to tears with End Up Here. I usually don't like to spend a lot of money on music, but this was one purchase I not only do not regret but also recommend to all of my friends.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|bought this for my hubby and he loves buble so it was a great surprise and the cx is awesome
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this game builds with each new level. I have been trying to (once &amp; for all) get to the end &amp; that's why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. it seems unattainable. I will keep trying but thinking about starting all over again is frustrating. still I have had lots of fun so....yes I would recommend it.
0142405809|5.0|Great story, I love reading this book with my son. Have lots of books from this author but this is probably my favourite. Captured my son's attention too which is not easy! He usually turns the page before I've finished reading it but not with this book.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I am reviewing both Mockingjay, and the series &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; itself in this review.<br /><br />It is exceedingly difficult to imagine, develop, create, and sustain such an engaging world that Suzanne Collins has produced in her Hunger Games novels.  However, it is even more challenging to produce such a strong series and not produce a disappointing finale to such a grand tale.  Mockingjay, I feel, is an example of such a disappointment.<br /><br />I approached The Hunger Games in the same way that I have approached other hugely popular franchises in the past.  Namely, I avoided it with all the prejudice and sneering you would expect out of such a book snob that I tend to be at times.  However, I found myself reading it mostly because it was on our Nook account when my wife began reading the series.  And I found myself largely impressed, especially with the first book.  It really is a solid piece of writing on its own.  It transcends the &#34;teen fiction&#34; label, one which I think it boasts mainly because the age of the character.  In the first book, we are introduced full force into the dystopian future time with little explanation or back story, which is completely acceptable in my mind.  Really, if you never even attempt to make any sort of explanation to a back story, it's okay.  It can help with the immersion of the story.  I like those sorts of books.  As the story progresses, we gain a nice love triangle that doesn't take too much of a forefront the way it does in the movie (much to the movie's discredit).  The action was well paced and doled out well to keep us on the edge of our seats, and the ending did well to keep us appropriately satisfied, but still on a cliff.<br /><br />The problems arrived in the next book.  I was wiling to put up the the recycled feel of the &#34;2nd&#34; hunger games.  I understood it was meant to be the action hook to the overarching backstory of the uprising of the districts, and it was okay.  However, the backstory was fairly vapid.  We caught brief glimpses of the uprising, of the growing enmity of President Snow, and of the 13th District and its role in the uprising.  The evolving love triangle produced a bit of a forbidden dangerous edge to the book, but the book ended with the conclusion of an almost forgettable Arena.  I mean really, 6 months after finishing the book I struggle to recall details of this &#34;epic&#34; battle.  Really the whole book seems a forgettable affair altogether.<br /><br />The final book, however, I just cannot understand.  Collins opened with what looked like a full forced attempt at world building.  She began to open the door to the background of the novel.  She began to show details of District 13, the ruins of District 12.  However, as I read the book, I looked at the last page, and realized that she had no way of making a succinct conclusion to this opus she was building in the opening pages of the book.  Sure enough, doors began to slam.  It was like trying to watch a movie with someone hitting fast forward every other scene.  The plot line, forced into a time warp, became unforgivably predictable.  We could see the plot twists coming from a mile away.  At the end of the book, it was just an overarching sense of disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, the series is a pretty good one.  I wish Collins had either expanded to a 4th book to make for more room to expand what she started at the beginning of Mockingjay.ory was fairly vapid.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  I love Charlaine Harris's writing.  She is pithy and funny.  If you want more of her, read her Lily Bard series, which she had enough sense to end after (I think) the fifth book.  The Sookie Stackhouse novels are the first vamp books I've ever gotten into simply because of Ms. Harris's writing style.  I got the distinct impression while reading the last two books that she was tired of the whole series and wanted to put Sookie to bed permanently.  This last novel isn't the best send off, but I thank her for not killing off my favorite WalMart shopper.  I think she did one more book for the readers, got the vamps off Ms. Stackhouse's back, and ended the series with an &#34;enough&#34; sort of attitude.  Having said that, I look forward to anything this woman writes.  She's as addictive as potato chips.
B000FA675C|4.0|I liked this book so much when it was first released, that I read all the Dan Brown books.  Having done that, I will tell you that if this were the last one that I read (after all his previous books), I would have found it formulaic.  As in his other works, there is a twist, but if you've read his others, you will be able to figure it out.<br /><br />I know many people were upset by the religious meanings of this book.  As long as you can understand that this is a work of fiction, and be able to keep your faith and church separate from your entertainment and reading, you will find this an enjoyable reading experience.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Many people may not agree with how Charlene Harris ended her series, but I believe (and no spoilers here folks) that she did just what Sookie really needed to make her happy.  I will miss your Sookie books Charlene, but cannot wait for more other characters to capture my heart!
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond's recent book \\"The World Since Yesterday\\" is another excellent commentary on the Human Condition.<br /> Although we cannot know for certain what our ancient Homo sapiens ancestors were like, Jared Diamond gives us an idea of where we came from on our long journey from savagery to civilization by giving us this broad insightful history of his own personal experience of his encounters with peoples who are in the process of emergence  from primitive tribal subsistence into the modern world of nation states.<br />  Our societies differ, he says only in that we have moved from internecine tribal warfare and the chain of revenge killing that marked societies that had no modern systematic enforcement of law to civilized non lethal mediation of disputes. He reminds us that we humans are all, primitive and modern, largely equal in intellectual gifts and that our advantages come from the cultural amenities that modern science and enlightened systems of justice have brought to our western lives. Read this book. You will not be disappointed and you will become more culturally enlightened  and enriched for the experience.<br />Ross Hamilton Henry, Humanist Minister.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0670024813 The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies?]]
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Never work on a Mac without it! Even the coveted Y0 and Y1 heads are included, which are required to remove batteries from MacBooks. I'll be reaching for this set a lot as I find myself DIY'ing repairs more often.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Fiction, not fact.  I found the masonic references to be a little off.  It does convey Freemasons in a favorable light, but some of its premises are largely incorrect.  I especially found the idea that wealth could buy advancement in Freemasonry to be completely contradictory to real life.<br /><br />Then, the end of the book: let. down.  Really, they go running all over Washington, only to find something common.  Really?<br /><br />As I have said with other Dan Brown books:  Formulaic.  If you've read several of his books, you will start looking for the &#34;twist&#34;.  If you are looking, it is too easy to see who the bad guy is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to download, does the job.good for simple arithmatical needs.  convenient on my kindle.<br />if you don't have one get this for free
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a truly unique series. The twists and turns, even if you know the gist of the story is incredible. It will keep you guessing all along the way. All the episodes (so far) are based on the original Doyle stories, with a nice modern twist. Benedict Cumberbatch really comes off as a quircky pain in the butt as fully intended. If you've never watched this series, you need to consider it. I loved the Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr., but in many ways this series blows them away.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|It was free for me on Amazon App a Day. It does exactly what it promises. I do wish it did scientific and unit conversion, too, though.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel provides a useful framework for analyzing the behavior of people,  uses many study to illustrate how to use the framework.  After reading this book I better understand my decision and decisions of friends and colleagues.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have been a part of the Clancy family since the early nineties.  What most has attracted me is the &#34;ahead-of-the-curve&#34; scenerios.  THE SUM OF ALL FEARS was years ahead of a threat of that kind. Now it is an ongoing concern.  THREAT VECTOR is just like it.  While I am reading about Chinese hackers, I am reading in the news about Chinese hacking of some of our business structure.  By now the characters are like a family.  I find myself concerned about their safety.  All in all, a great read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought it was worth the read....especially if you like romance with a twist. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br />:-)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Don't need a Kindle to read Kindle titles. And the cloud remembers your stuff if you change devices. Great product.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|For anyone who has read the books but hasn't seen the show for fear of being disappointed, go ahead and watch it. There is no difference and the casting is perfect (of course the books have a bit more detail). Although I enjoy this series very much, and generally have no trouble suspending disbelief, I do have one complaint/question.  If the characters are all (mostly) so selfish and ruthless, how did they even survive this long? They're dropping like flies already, and it will continue!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|This was a funny and well done movie. It held my nephew's attention throughout. I would recommend it to others.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My 6 year old son loves it. I like it because it's reminds me of working on a puzzle. Worth a try.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Maybe I am just a softie, but I enjoyed this season as well as the first.  Anytime there is such a &#34;shake it up&#34; plot arc as WWI, there is bound to be some &#34;cheese&#34;.  I approve of the way this was handled. I would have preferred a different consequences for the different footmen. (But everyone has their own favorites.) Well worth the time spent watching. Now I have to try and find  a way to justify paying for Season 3. I do not want to wait until it is included in prime, or until I can find it at my video store. VERY IMPRESSED with the series overall.  Characters, plots, etc all entertaining while remaining close enough to realistic to dim all the the purists.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Kept me interested the entire time. Sad that it's the end of the series though. Overall a great book and worth reading.

B0084U0IEG|3.0|What would have been a halfway decent fictionalized introduction to an obscure branch of anti-communism, is made unrecommendable by DISGUSTING sexual scenes and references. (You don't want to know!!) Let's just say I'd love to do a brain flush on his anatomic descriptions of secondary/tertiary characters. Some really good material, but it's soiled/spoiled.

B004PVKFR8|2.0|I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in that I bought this cd for one song - sail - and hoped there would be more like it on the album. There's not.
193700788X|5.0|I've been reading the Sookie Stackhouse books since they first came out years ago. I've liked every single one and this was the perfect way to end the series for me. Sookie ends up with a guy she at least has a chance of a future with but if that relationship fails, so what. Life, and Sookie thank goodness still was fully alive at the end of the series, moves on. People grow up and relationships change. The plot engaged me, the characters were spot on and sometimes surprised me and I loved the addition of Eric's other \\"child\\". Eric didn't end up exactly where he wanted to be but I'm sure he'll make the best of it! And Pam, Sheriff Pam, it couldn't have worked out any better for her. Thank you Ms. Harris for keeping me entertained for...13?...years? I look forward to your next book. Whatever direction you go in I will follow!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I didn't expect to see the face of the mother so soon...i love this show and hate to see it all come together so soon! Wish it never had to end! Still..this is the best written sitcom ever experienced!

B00BWI3RTA|3.0|I guess if a listener wanted to hear some hip hop mixed in with Dido's otherwise wonderful voice, I would recommend this cd. There are a few good songs, but none that are really memorable. Sometimes, however, music has a way of growing on me, so who knows... perhaps I'll revisit this review in a few months and have something different to say.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|So glad the series will continue one more season.  I like the way it begins at Farhampton and ends at Farhampton with the final shot being the mother.  Can't wait til next season.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a true yet very funny movie - I laughed my pants off throughout most of the movie! Thanks for listing this in our Prime selection!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought it was worth the read....especially if you like romance with a twist. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br />:-)
B001KO8AQ6|3.0|Seriously. Better, but still not great. This album is a mix of deep, heavy, serious, somewhat depressing, with a splash of color here and there to highlight the enormity of the void it represents.
0756686970|5.0|We used the little guy to make a Han Solo in Carbonite dessert for a Star Wars themed baby shower. It was super cute and we gave the book to the expecting couple to save later for their son. Adorable!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I didn't think they could do as good a job as they did with seasons one and two, but they did....until they ruined it for me at the end.  But that's just me.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was really good! If you enjpyed the series, you will like this one! It has a surprise ending. that I was not expecting!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Michael Pollan's books have changed my food-purchase and cooking habits.  He writes with<br />humor as well as expertise, and I recommend this latest book with pleasure.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|One of the better free apps of the day I've seen!  The game was very addicting...likely because it was easy to learn and fun to play.
B009NY43NY|5.0|*******SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW*******<br /><br />Even though I was disenchanted with the last two books in this series (I thought the author did a half ass job), I was okay with this final installment.<br /><br />Although the writing style was much different, (lots of \\"Meanwhile in another part of town\\") it gave me the same feeling of being immersed in Sookie's world. It was comforting for me because I really missed that aspect in the prior two books.<br /><br />The ending of this book makes sense to me because in the first couple of books, Sookie was very attracted to Sam, but didn't want to mess up the friendship. After that, she got with vampires because she thought of them as mysterious and interesting and their empty void was soothing to her because she didn't have to hear their thoughts. It was a change from the small town minds she was reading every day. The vampires helped her discover who she was and helped her to control her power, but they also got her beat up on several occasions and put her in life threatening situations.<br /><br />I thought that by the end of the series, she was kind of fed up with the kind of excitement vampires brought and was able to finally see that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. She realized that she was okay with her small town life and wanted the peace that brought. She was ready to get back to the roots of her upbringing.<br /><br />I think that anyone who was surprised at the demise of Sookie's relationship with Eric needs to go back and reread the earlier books. He made it clear that he loved her, but at the same time, he wanted her to fit into his idea of what his girlfriend/wife should be. He didn't want her to react emotionally to killing in order to protect him, he didn't want her dancing her little dance with her friend in the club, he didn't want her speaking out of turn when other vampires were present, he didn't want her to use the cluviel dor for anything else but him. I always thought that he was a little bit domineering with her. And did you really think that the Vampire Eric was going to let Sookie just get old and die? Of course he wanted to turn her! He has a steamroller personality. I am sure he figured she would just get over it after the deed was done.<br /><br />Eric is a vampire politician to his bones. I think he saw what being married to the Queen would mean to his career, his social position, and his ambitions. While he had to put up with the Queen's possessiveness, he saw the benefits and went along with it. After his 200 years are up, he'll be able to write his own ticket. Eric has always put his own best interests first. Everything and everyone else was secondary.<br /><br />I think that the author has a right to command her characters in any way she sees fit, but I do think that it needs to make sense according to what she had written in prior books. To me, it made sense.<br /><br />It was obvious to me that Sookie was getting sick of the vampire world, even if there were vampires she liked on a personal level.<br /><br />There are people that say that the best person to marry is your best friend. I think that Eric was her lover, but not her friend. There were things about Sookie that he didn't accept and wanted to change.

B003G4W49C|3.0|I am possibly the only person in the universe who is not crazy about this book.  So be it.  A bunch of messed up kids are thrown into a harsh boarding camp and instead of becoming a bunch of slightly older messed up kids they become military geniuses.  They fight an alien race and there is indeed a nice surprise ending but that's it.  Ender's Game has always struck me as a one-trick pony.  I do have to admit that it is a really good trick but it is still just not enough for me.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I got hooked on this series by watching it on Netflix.  Great characters, interesting plots.  The team dynamic works well.
B00AECDDYY|2.0|This game plays like a drawn-out tower defense game.<br /><br />You have basically two options, upgrade a structure or send out a ship. The ships you send out are on autopilot. You can pick their initial path, but you cannot control them once they're on their way. All you can do is watch them as they fire cannonballs at the enemy. Once you get enough gold, send out another ship, then watch some more.<br /><br />You'll spend most of your time just watching ships shoot at each other, and waiting for your gold level to increase enough for you to buy something. Buy, watch, buy, watch.<br /><br />Maybe the upper levels are more interesting, but I got so bored going through the first island that I just quit.<br /><br />And, yes, I do feel a little bad having to say that. The developers did put some care into this game. But it isn't what I was hoping for.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the Broadway Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic Theater in New York when it first ran, and then again in Philadelphia, and again at The Kennedy Center, and this production at the Royal Albert Hall is like seeing it all over again, and just as magnificent. Well done! I loved it and can't imagine anyone not enjoying this production.  The Grand Finale at the end is beyond spectacular with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman and some of the previous performers of the Phantom productions. One can't go wrong with this one. Let your mind soar through the Music of the Night in this Grand Performance.
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|brilliant, fascinating , thought provoking .  A strong message to modern society to be aware of the consequences of the food we eat and the alcohol we drink to our health.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Really liked this book (book club selection).<br /><br />Chbosky did a good job with story development, although Charlie (main character) seemed a LOT younger than his stated age. Perhaps this was author's stab at emotional immaturity or niaivity.<br /><br />p.s. the film is not as good as the book. if you're interested in this story, i highly recommend the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Once again, Julian Fellowes has bestowed a season filled with drama, love, deviousness, sadness, and empathy. He has a gift in creating characters who are completely believable - so much that I don't want the story to end. The ensemble works beautifully - from speech, to costuming, to the details in the scenes - putting it all together for us to enjoy.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Was horrible. Ate up way to much memory and was slower than a turtle running through mud. I do not recommend it.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|This is just the movie to watch if you like a creepy, scary movie. Just what I like. I don't like the bloody gory ones so this one is just right.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|REVIEWED BY LAURA<br /><br />I have to admit I was a bit skeptical when starting this one, having already read what I considered the quintessential hiking memoir (A WALK IN THE WOODS by Bill Bryson). I thought to myself, does the world really need another book about someone who went on a long-distance hike? As it turns out, YES, that is exactly what the world needed.<br /><br />To clarify, A WALK IN THE WOODS and WILD--while both excellent in their own right--are two vastly different books. While A WALK IN THE WOODS is full of Bryson's avuncular humor and wry observations (making parts laugh-out-loud funny), WILD is an unflinching look at a woman's physical, emotional, and spiritual journey.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed (I was a bit sad to learn that this wasn't her given last name, she made it up herself) has written a book that seamlessly weaves her experiences as a lone woman hiker on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) with the life experiences that brought her to that point: her impoverished childhood in rural Minnesota (coincidentally just mere miles from where my husband grew up!), the death of her mother, and the failure of her marriage.<br /><br />Strayed is an easy narrator to like, even though some of the stuff she admits to doesn't paint her in the most flattering light. I always admire memoirists who tell the truth, even when their actions come across as less than admirable. I was emotionally hooked on this book from the beginning, partly because of her descriptions of her childhood in Minnesota, but also because as a reader you really, really, really don't think it's a good idea for her to embark on this hike. She is so utterly and completely unprepared for long-distance hiking--her boots are all wrong, her camp stove is dysfunctional, and her pack is so heavy she can't lift it without building up momentum first. Her planning is a little spotty, and she has to make it to certain stops along the way at certain times to pick up resupply boxes, otherwise she is out of food/money. And let me tell you, there are some TENSE moments with regard to running out of food and water. But you can't help but root for her.<br /><br />I loved her descriptions of life on the trail--especially all of the various characters she meets along the way. Some become fast friends and they cross paths multiple times throughout the book; others are just people who give her a quick ride or perhaps loan her some blister cream. One man sat down with her and helped her get rid of everything unnecessary in her pack (\\"Do you really need this compact foldable hand saw?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Do you know what to use it for?\\" \\"Well....no.\\") Almost everyone she meets is astonished that she is a lone woman hiking the PCT. Apparently this was basically unheard of in the mid-90s. Which I think makes the whole endeavor that much gutsier. While I loved hearing about her encounters with other hikers, I also loved how all of the alone time she had changed her whole outlook on her life and what she is capable of.<br /><br />FYI, Cheryl Strayed can WRITE. She moved me to tears more than once, especially when describing the deaths of her mother and a childhood horse. She made me feel what it would be like to take a warm shower after weeks without one. Or how exquisite a cheeseburger would taste after weeks of beef jerky and a product dubiously called \\"Better Than Milk.\\" Or how amazingly refreshing even the warmest and grossest water would taste after miles of searching for a safe water source. If I had written this book, it would be page after page of: \\"Hiked today. Ate food. Slept in sleeping bag.\\" It takes a pretty special author to make a book about an 1100-mile hike a page turner, is what I'm saying.<br /><br />Those of you who know me know that I tend to be a bit of a book-obsessive--once I find an author I like I feel compelled to read EVERYTHING HE OR SHE HAS EVER WRITTEN. And also I sort of want to be best friends with them. Ahem. So it should come as no surprise to you thatI loved the writing and her so much that immediately after finishing this book, I picked up another book by her, TINY BEAUTIFUL THINGS. I also plan to pick up her first novel, TORCH, sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, that's the entirety of what Strayed has published so far. But I will wait (semi-patiently) for more. :)<br /><br />For those of us who most likely will never take such a journey (though I am sort of tempted to now--maybe if there were hotels to stay at every couple of days?), reading a book like this is the next best thing. I listened to this as an audiobook, and at first Bernadette Dunne and I had some issues. I was not a fan of her narration--for some reason her voice really grated on me. This only lasted for a short time, though. After a CD or two, her voice BECAME Cheryl Strayed's for me. In fact, when I heard the author's real voice for the first time I thought \\"that's not really her!\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line<br />In case you haven't noticed, I really loved this book. I guess for some reason I really enjoy books about walking (see also my review of THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY)? An amazingly written memoir filled with adventure and introspection, I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt lost or felt the urge to do something completely unexpected and crazy just to break out of a rut. Or anyone who just wants a good story with a narrator who is adept at balancing her own navel-gazing with real-life adventure. That's really what makes this book so magical. Either book on its own (a book purely about hiking the trail or a book purely about losing her mom and her dysfunctional childhood) would not have worked half as well. It's the marriage of the two parts that makes this one an unforgettable and not-to-missed read.<br /><br />Rating: AI loved the writing and her so much that immediately after finishing this book, I picked up another book by her, TINY BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

B00CFQN12Q|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Die Hard films.  One and three are my personal favorites, but I also enjoy two and four.  Because it's Die Hard, we can forget about &#34;realism&#34; or anything being even remotely possible for a human being to do (and survive).  What I found most disappointing about this film was the lack of banter between John McClane and the antagonists.  He had a minimal amount with his son, Jack, but almost zero with the &#34;villains&#34; of the movie.  The real strength of this series has always been the dialog, which this movie lacked.  It was mostly just a running gun battle, with the Yippee-kay-aye catch phrase thrown in almost as an afterthought.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I absolutely love this strategy game! Its got fun gameplay and is quite challenging. I can't recommend this game enough and can't stop playing it myself!!! So click that buy button. NOW
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|It was it did everything I wanted it to. But one thing it didn't do was connect to my iPod radio
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Mary Elizabeth Winstead heads a first-rate cast under the excellent direction of Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. in this familiar tale of the discovery of an alien trapped in a block of polar ice.  The alien is able to replicate humans, and replicate it does, in terrifying fashion, keeping you guessing as to whose chest cavity it will explode from next.  The special effects are very spooky, reminiscent of \\"Alien,\\" and the narrative flows nicely.  Kudos to all.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I enjoy tabletop gaming more than my wife; she's not really into playing Ticket to Ride with me or other more complex games, but I bought Takenoko after seeing it played on Geek and Sundry's Tabletop Day coverage and it's a game my wife now loves to play. The replayability is great and the game components are well designed and colorful.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. We can see why it was nominated for many Academy Awards. Perfect date night movie.

0062224050|5.0|Like the way LeHane writes, so like anything he writes.  Enjoy following the partners (Kenzie and Gennaro) because they are so believable.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved the series since the very beginning. I could not stand the HBO series-just could not watch it. So sorry the end had to come- so now I'm buying them for my kindle, instead of hard copies.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|hilarious. best tom cruise roll ever. truky an enjoyable flick. buy it. but dont go.fill retard. good cast crew production
B007KTA9PU|5.0|I can't figure out why I lost track of this man's music for a while but I did.  I came to this recording belatedly even though I watch \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\" every couple of years as much to hear his songs on the soundtrack as to enjoy the Robert Altman atmospherics.  No matter (and considerably off topic).  Whenever you come across this album, listen to it. It has great, great lyrics and nicely recorded vocals that are as fresh and provocative as anything he's done.  This \\"phase\\" of his voice, somewhere between the pleasant rasp of the 70's and the guttural murmur of now, is very easy to listen to and probably my favorite.  But having said that, if you haven't heard Leonard sing, sample a song before buying any.  It's not impossible, I'm told, to find his singing an acquired taste.
B000E41MRC|5.0|This is a really wonderful view of how the Germanic people were so swayed by such a incredibly remarkably mad person. Buy it for a study in how not to repeat history.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I just love House in general, and to see the ending for the saga makes it a complete<br />package. I never tired of any of it and still watch from beginning to end. My House<br />marathon is better than any Three Stooges Marathon anytime!!! ;)

B004JN1D2I|4.0|I really enjoy reading series, as they allow an in-depth view of their characters and can build a good story.  This series was really intriguing because it was historical (but a fantasy) and had all kinds of interpersonal relationships and conspiracies.  Along the same lines as Lord of The Rings with a completely different theme.  I always find it interesting to explore the world of power and old-fashioned gender discrimmination from the past.  Makes me very glad not to have been a woman living during this time.  The books were easy to read and compelling enough to keep you up late at night.  I would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in historical, fantasy fiction.<br />Diana Young #1 Amazon best-selling author www.financialfitnessbooks.com
B0081336FO|5.0|Liked this better than the CBS show. it follows the original text from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself, and adds a modern day twist to it
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|For the price, what you get is pretty legit.  I haven't extensively used the software, but the only thing i would complain about is that the function that lets you change the light on the mouse is kind of wonky and the colors that it actually displays aren't properly represented.  But, realistically I didn't get this mouse for the color changing light so this product is great as it is.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|There are not enough superlatives for me to explain how excited I am about this album. I know Simon will get (or perhaps already is) tired of the inevitable comparisons to his father. If he has ever felt he was living in Phil's shadow, with this effort he has emerged into full sunlight.  That being said, you cannot listen to this album without thinking of Genesis.  For me, it's as if the entire group entered a time machine, returned to the present, and are delivering a fresh new approach worthy of the 21st Century.  When I imported the disc into iTunes, it showed up in the \\"Metal\\" genre.  I am not sure who assigns those ridiculous categories, but I am here to tell you that Dimensionaut is \\"prog rock.\\"  It's rich, lyrical, melodical, beautiful, well-sung, well played and MOST OF ALL extremely well produced.  Man, o man I am excited.  I have this playing in the car right now.  I find excuses to drive around just so I can hear it again and again.  You will not be disappointed.  First and foremost, I was a Genesis fan.  The first album I ever bought was \\"Genesis to Revelation.\\"  This gives you some idea of how old I am. I am a huge fan of Porcupine Tree, Pineapple Thief, Anathema and a little Opeth. This Simon Collins effort, so far, stands on the shoulders of those giants. It will go down in history as one of the greatest prog-rock, adult-intelligent-rock albums ever put together. Hats off to Sound of Contact, you deserve a giant pat on the back. Now if only it can also be commercially successful.  Vort.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|If you liked the first part, you'll love this one. Although you'll find that it is a bit darker and more moody.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I haven't played this game but my grandson loves it. He has not put it down since I added it
B008J34466|5.0|P!nk never disappoints! I love the popular Try & Just Give Me A Reason but I have fallen in love with the little known or played Beam Me Up.    My expectations are well exceeded.
193413712X|4.0|But the strange little story meanders sometimes confusingly. I was touched by this book that trails a nostalgic finger through the lives of a number of related men.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love all the different games.  Wish there was more information about the game.  Like the times you need to get for each star.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm totally not a gamer, but totally love this game! =} It's a game that my whole family loves. My husband downloaded on his phone & our oldest son downloaded on his tablet. Our other children always look for the chance to play it on my Kindle. I am proud to say that I am further on the game than anyone else in our home........& they're all huge gamers!! =}
B00007KWHP|5.0|This album, in my humble opinion, is the best that Yes put out, before they became too &#34;progressive&#34; for me, which in English translates to excessive rambling with little to no melody. But Fragile has it all, great melodies, great songs, and it rocks. Highly recommend!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very good book, very unusual and hooks you fast so you cant put the book down, I quite enjoyed it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. The ending was what I expected but how the author reached it was great. I found another book to keep on my kindle.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is very calming good for kids of all ages, or adults! It's so great! There is one glitch, though. On the close friends mission, no matter what I do, I can't get the second half of it done! So minus that, 5 stars!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I enjoyed Julianne Hough in this leading role to a well written story. Loved the twist at the end didn't see that coming
0979019753|5.0|We all want to live a better life.  Bottom line. And to be honest, we sometimes don't have time, and have read a lot books about self improvement but can't really put the pieces together.  Well, that's what Hal does.  He did the hard work for us, so we don't have to.  He takes many different pieces of self improvement strategies and puts them together in a simple formula.  S.A.V.E.R... You will understand what I mean if you get the book.  Awesome read.
B000002BVN|2.0|This is the first  MJ CD I can even remotely say I do not like.  The mixes all sound the same to me...same instruments and percussion, same rapid rhythms and Michael's voice is not very audible or pleasant.  I am not putting it on my MP3 with  the 9 other Michael Jackson CDs.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book was simply amazing after reading the other two! it is truly awe inspiring how well she ended it with leaving enough up to you as a reader to make the ending a truly unique experience. Although delirium is still my favorite of the trilogy this book was a close close second.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Its a bit boring at the beginning but then its actually a really interesting story. Well written and good book
B001CTDH76|5.0|I love this show, can't wait to get my hands on season 2. The only drawback to this purchase was that the case it came in was slightly damaged, but the discs were fine.
048623231X|5.0|I purchased the Dore Illustrations as a companion to Dante's Divine Comedy that I purchased at the same time.  It suits the job well, giving visuals to the text.<br /><br />The package was delivered quickly a day early, before the Dante's Divine Comedy and a second volume that I also ordered.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I don't know how many thousands (yes, thousands is how it feels) of new names and characters are introduced in this one but the read even becomes uncomfortable.  There is nothing of some of the best characters and even what is written about the others just seems off.  People tell me you just have to find a way through this one to get to book five so let's hope they're right.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This series is fabulous.  I love the characters and they get into one scrape after another with great sex in between.  Oh, the movies in my mind!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Nice new model rear Nikkor lens cap.<br />The changes are subtle but it performs better.<br />Easier grip and better looking.<br />Thank you
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was breathtaking! It takes you on a journey from the very beginning. The best part was the play on words and the ability to create this fantasy and then still keep you in reality.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Helped me better understand the television program. Explains a lot of details clearly. Fun to read. I am now enjoying second book in series.
B00004YTZE|3.0|After the New York Dolls disintegrated, largely due to the drug habits of Nolan and Thunders, these two teamed up with New York's other proto-punk bad boy Richard Hell as the Heartbreakers. It was a trio that was never going to work and Hell quickly was replaced by Walter Lure and Billy Rath.<br />It was this line up of the band that came to the UK and toured with the Sex Pistols on the Anarchy in the UK Tour in December 1976. They then quickly produced this one studio album L.A.M.F. It was more a case of the record company trying to show they were still in business to protect their back royalties from other artists than actually doing the best they could for the Heartbreakers. The recording quality was terrible but this remix almost makes up for that. The music is a mixture of punk, R&B and rock and roll and as a record of that early punk scene it is a must for any collector - it is just a shame it wasn't recorded and mixed correctly at the time as the live potential of the band never quite was reflected on vinyl, or now CD.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Very slow take off. I hope it gets better, I like a little more action than family politics when it comes to my reading
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I was intrigued the whole way, I wanted someone to die and it happened, more than once... it was intense
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This was a great way to catch up, and I am thinking of seeing it this way in the new season, because commercials are taking more and more of regular TV air time.

0307895475|4.0|confusing book but like I said it is what I asked for. The game seems like it can last forever
B00CWVGS10|1.0|Very slow to start. Action takes forever and it's like watching a children's school play. I could have made one, posted on YouTube and bet on who gets the most ratings. ME!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Why such a low rating you ask? First off it deleted all but my home saved locations. Secondly why would I want to waste a 1/3 of valuable screen space looking at a menu the has worked well when it was a drop-down. I'd rather be able to look at a larger map so I can see what weather/storm is headed towards me. Third I hope everyone who uses this has WiFi or 4g as it is heavy with graphics. Even with graphics turned off you still have the whole &quot;News&quot; section full of graphics. I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire HD first but will NOT be updating my smart phone. I'd like to find the previous version and re-install it. :( This was my favorite weather app, now it's the last one all choose.

B004IPPINW|3.0|This is a subtle novel about a young Pakistani man, who after hard work gets into Princeton and later a top financial services company on Wall Street. Already struggling with his identity as a Pakistani and now a member of the financial elite in the US, 9/11 occurs and suddenly NYC no longer feels like the cosmopolitan welcoming city, based on a meritocracy it once was. Also, in parallel, he struggles with a relationship with a young woman, who quickly is losing her grip on reality. Stylistically the same as How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, I'd recommend this book to anyone who doesn't &#34;get&#34; why people outside of the US are so frustrated with our foreign policies. For everyone else, I'd say skip it, you already know.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|I believe we are all connected. This movie is plausible fantasy. It's about love, too. And faith. And hope. Watch it if you want to feel good.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|As the dynamics change, so change the plot lines. &#34;The plot thickens.&#34; Twists and turns abound. &#34;Like sands through the hour glass....&#34;

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Fun story about a 100-year-old man, who is living in a retirement home in Sweden, who on his 100th birthday decides he would like to die somewhere other than under the thumb of evil Director Alice and climbs out of the window. From that decision, the book explores the multitude of experiences he had in his life including his start as a blast expert, participation in several wars, meeting sitting US presidents, Chairman Man, Stalin, and a host of other major players in the 20th century.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. the little monster thing is so cute. I recommend this game to anyone.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The author tied up all the loose ends and gives Sookie a chance to say fair well to her world in style.  This book was a treat for fans of the series.  I loved it!!  I felt like it the author left nothing unsaid and I am glad I was able know how Sookie's story ends.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book. You can not put it down once you start reading it. I saw where he did not give away any secrets and just told the truth about what happened that day.  Thank god for the Seal Team that took that evil man out. You will love this book.

B00C7O8MJ8|1.0|I collect all the Star Trek soundtracks, and the 2009 film had a pretty decent one. So I was really looking forward to this soundtrack.<br /><br />What a disappointment. This is essentially \\"Star Trek 2009\\" on shuffle mode. Practically the whole thing is recycled.<br /><br />You can't cut corners if you want to make a great film. Pass on this one guys.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It's not a true story, it's just a true incident taken and embellished to make it a thriller and give folks a wrong impression of coal and dagger

B001UTW7QU|5.0|My wife and I are hooked...along with my 23 year old son. Sometimes grusome but usually momentary and usually sureal circumstances. Drama, humor, terror and love create episodes that keep you coming back. Not a big TV guy but this keeps my interest with a little science and current science fiction.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The writer keeps you in suspense. John Grisham always writes to entertain and keep you wondering how the book will end.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I don't get all the hate for this movie. It's visually amazing, the writing is good, and it's more impactful than I expected going into it. Just don't expect this to be the next Titanic or Good Will Hunting and you'll thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />Plus the Blu-Ray has some awesome behind the scenes.
B009NY43NY|3.0|After reading the whole series I was hoping for more than a recap of what had already happened and a blah ending.
B002EXEGTW|5.0|It's Amazing what they did in the late 60's w/so little technology! It was a suspenseful nail biter for sure!
0062082353|5.0|I loved this book. What a courageous young man.  So sad when he came to Austin, Texas, to be buried in our State Cemetery.  We welcomed him all over the city. God Bless this man's soul. Thank God we had him for a while. He is my hero.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101<br /><br />Has so many games to choose from  you  can play all  day and never get  bored. The...games are great for  all ages and skill  levels. Very addicting
1603420398|5.0|This book is fabulous!  It has a lot of creative patters and very well written instructions.  The pictures are of a good quality as well.
B00000DIII|5.0|I got turned on to these guy's on a music TV show. It said, &#34;if you like the Black Keys, you'll love the Sheepdogs&#34;, and so I gave them a chance and bought this disc. I have not been disappointed. They are not the Black Keys. They have their own sound, and it is great. Some of the tonal qualities in the voices are very similar to the Keys and the tempo of the music. In the end I have to agree with the TV, Sheepdogs!
0307730697|5.0|I loved this book. The Navy Seal Teams are absolutely wonderful, fearless, courageous, patriotic American men, fighting for this country and to protect its citizens.  God Bless them.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|Love watching this with my little girl as she loves watching people dance and sing. The cast is amazing at it.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Just get DragonVale it's much better than this! First of all you just feed and they evolve, you don't need an evolution temple. Secondly, The quality of the game is MUCH better.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|its difficult to make a good surfing movie and although this was a good effort; it still falls short of the adventure I expected.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Perfect to get basic camera functions under the belt. Easy to understand, great read. Does not confuse with technicalities, practical and useful
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The cast was great. I cried a few times, you felt like your heart was breaking for them. The story is amazing and it is based on a true story.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|IReally Enjoyed Playing This Game, I Just Wish It Had More To Do After REaching 10mil. Maybe An Update OnE Day!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Digital beautiful copy of a great broadway musical. Heartwarming story. The extra material by the star, now grown up, shows how it affected her life.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Factual and fun read, inspirational. Not poetry by any means, but a really inspiring and thought provoking read. Did research the claims the mass to studies done- all true. Definite read for any runner
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. The actors were great and I was engaged in what was happening the entire time.
B004WR125O|5.0|I connected this LAN adapter to my Onkyo TX-NR818, and works perfectly. Great reception. I would highly recommend. Give me several more options for listening.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very bloody, It gives real insight as to what it may have been to live just before the civil war.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|But once all the mini stories got closer to their arcs, things got really interesting. I will watch it again to see if I missed anything.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Awesome concert with some true Blues legends and the Stones jamming on stage at the Checkerboard. True fans of the Blues will love it...
1400032717|5.0|Great but not always easy read that takes one inside the Asperger's mind and the less than perfect relationships that form around such a person.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|good movie, I liked the way that it  was shot. Seemed very real and Jennifer is a great actress. Amen
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I happen to like super hero/action/adventure movies.  When they are well made they are great.  This one was absolutely great.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really like this game but I wish there was a way to get more diamonds and I wish it was cheaper to disinchant
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E. L. James’ Fifty Shades trilogy is a wanker mash-up of Beauty and the Beast<br />and the Perils of Pauline. Of course it’s outrageous fiction. What do you<br />expect, starting from the premise of a 21 year-old virgin? But it’s a fun read:<br />romantic, dramatic and triple-ecstatic. Do yourself a favor: buy the whole<br />trilogy. Two chapters into volume one, Fifty Shades of Grey, you’ll be glad you<br />did.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|As with my last review, story was great. Again there were the emotional ups and downs but after reading book 1 I was expecting this. Cant wait for book 3.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|quite frustrating that news feed doesn't seem to work very well and I cant watch any of the videos! guessing will have to stick to using my iphone for facebook. the screen is way smaller but at least the app works!
B000002KBA|3.0|I write this review for all the deepest DP fans out there. As far as this particular CD version goes...don't bother. Buy the remastered version instead. You'll be glad you did. Reason being is that this product preview lists the tracks only not the time lengths. So you will soon find out that this CD is the American version which consists of an EDITED version of \\"Speed King\\" (one of DP's best songs). The true total time length of the song is 5:53. On this CD it is only 4:23 and totally prevents the listener from hearing the blistering guitar intro the original version was intended to have. Plus with the remastered version you'll get bonus extras such as the original single version of \\"Black Night\\", alternate takes and remixes of other songs in the studio (not to mention GREAT sound quality). So for $17 you can basically buy the remastered version for less plus something else!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is the bomb<br />Best book I've ever read<br />Rick Riordan rocks<br />I think the rest of the series will also be great
B00866H7SS|5.0|Story was great, the only thing that frustrated me was the constant high and low emotions, one moment Eva was euphoric, in orgasmic heaven......the next minute she was questioning in her mind something she saw fleetingly in Gideons face. Apart from that I cant wait for book 2.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|I am a kid at heart and also a female artist.  I loved the fact that Miss Potter lived her life as she wanted to, by painting, my passion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There's definitely a reason this book has become a fan favorite. So intense. So hot. Definitely worth your time and money.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|a few good ones, too much monologue, really different.  Not exactly what I was expecting from Daft Punk.  Maybe it will grow on me...
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved the first two books by the author but this novel was disjointed and didn't flow nearly as well.
B00241YHMU|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when my sister brought this movie to our house for our &#34;Friday, family movie night&#34;.  I so loved the concept of the movie that I purchased it, and I don't usually buy many videos.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Based on the success of The Lord of the Rings, this seems like an unnecessary stretch of a short book into three long movies.
0525948023|5.0|Another great Teacher of  Enlightenment, Spirituality, and Awakening. Oprah made Tolle known to many of us who had never heard of him before. He too teaches us how to transform ourselves and our environment, into a peaceful, comfortable  non-complex environment  no matter where we might be. Its again awakening the Buddha within. We need to share these extraordinary spiritual teachers with all who show some interest. Its very hard to explain the enlightenment that is learned from the teachings, and how differently one who has awakened, approaches and accepts what ever comes..,ie., the bad and the good. These spiritual scholars are on the same tract as our spiritual teachers of the past. You don't lose anything by looking into it. What I like about Amazon, so far I have not run into any product that they don't have or cant get. I do a lot of research, and I need the resource engine and supplier. That's Amazon. They haven't made me out of a liar yet...MO
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|Fun app for my granddaughter but she cost me $25.00 in her first hours play before I limited her access.<br />Be careful about additional charges they add up fast!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It's very slow.  When I went to watch the videos, even though I got a message that the download was finished, I couldn't find it.  I wouldn't even bother. I uninstalled it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so excited about this book that I preordered it.  I stayed away from the the leaked spoilers and now wish I hadn't and saved myself the money.  Sookie Stackhouse fans could have gotten together and written a better finale.  What happened?
B00AWBYA2G|5.0|Wonderful, feel good movie with a happy ending......Rock opera that highlights songs of The Beatles.  Took a 2 hour trip down memory lane during the 60's....condensed version covering major highlights....wonderful movie would definitely watch again.
B00633PFQC|4.0|Have just finished bk cl discusson of this book, Arthor is outstanding world renown,Everyone should read his book and have a discussion and let it affect you for the long haul,It is about the changing of values and conduct throughout our business and social world everywhere includlng government/
B0044XRIMW|5.0|It shows how it is important to have fun in life as well as to work hard, and to never give up what you believe is right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game for my two year old son. he loves horses and loves to feed the horse. hardnto get gems without cheatkng
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written by a neurosurgeon.  It is well documented and very believable.  A story told by a previous non-believer.  A man well versed on the workings of the brain.  I choose to believe his story, some of those to whom I have recommended the book did not see it as I did.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This season is great. It has my favorite episode of all time, The Blue Butterly. Great season, I recommend it.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It was interesting to see how the e planned the little details. It definitely had a few twists and turns. I would definitely watch it again!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A delightful story!  It would make a wonderful movie. So many fun characters mixed with the horrors of the occupation
1451695195|2.0|This book contains less than 10% about his afterlife experience, and 90% about a lot of other things that does'nt interest me.<br />So if you want to know about the afterlife this book is waste of money.
B0081336FO|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely. Great Sherlock and Watson casting.  Plot twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat as you try to match wits with Sherlock..
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Ending could've been better....otherwise, it was good.<br />Had some scary parts to it....the &#34;jump out at you&#34; kind.<br />Would recommend this movie
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I love playing with all the different effects that this camera has!<br />I often flip thru all of the settings when I am going to take pictures for fun!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|read the book before i watched the movie. nicholas sparks is a very good writer and movie producer.appropriate for all ages to watch considering what is on regular television.would watch this again.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|I loved the movie and the soundtrack is amazing, i love the feelings it evokes and makes me feel as if im in another time and place
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait for the next season. Both actors compliment each other. They make a great pair.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I can't wait for the next book. Jeffrey Archer is a fabulous writer. His characters come alive and also give a sense of history at the same time. I gave recommended it to several friends who loved it as much as I did.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The kids and I enjoyed very much! Both a girl or a boy would enjoy this movie; I would rent this again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just when you think you are getting comfortable and maybe think you know it all. The ending is a shocker!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore is my new favorite artist. Every song is fantastic, couldn't be happier...I'll be buying the extra songs that come on the deluxe version ASAP!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Sookie ties up a lot of lose ends in the series finale. Many characters return, often briefly, as Sookie has her last adventure in mystery and the mysterious. Goodbye, dear one. It's been fun.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|It is exciting to watch and it has plenty of action that shows the inner working of a Viking  clan.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|came with all the good songs and her voice is beautiful. packaged nicely and everything was perfect and on time :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!! Best book ever! It is epic and sweet. Can't wait for Catching fire to come out in November 2013!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was expecting a generic romantic comedy that somehow managed to get some Oscar nods. Instead, I get a surprisingly effective and occasionally deeply dark movie about struggling with mental illness (that also has a romance as one of its story lines). Worth your time.
B00993I6D2|3.0|Hard to understand at first if you havn't read the book.<br />As always the book was better.<br />Worth watching on a rainy day.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I rented this movie from red box and I can't wait to own it. Django has everything you could want in a movie. It has action, violence, comedy, romance, suspense, and drama.  I could watch this movie over and over again. I absolutely loved it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this is a pretty good game.its fun on my kindle<br />I wish you didn't have too spend your money to get better wepons
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good characterisation of the main man, Jack Reacher plus the varying leading characters in the story. The plot is well set out with plenty of suspense, albeit the premise for the mystery is beyond credibility. Some of the depictions of the violence is rather gratuitous, but does not overly distract from the book. All in all a good, lightweight page turner
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Things really heat up as the 2 Olivia Dunhams swap universes and some other things as well! Always  an engaging who.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|As always Big Bang Theory is one of our favorite shows. My husband is very sheldony so he laughs and gets all the jokes that are over my head.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so great. I didnt like it at first but now that i get it, i just cant stop playing! I recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A book that probably needs more than one read to extract the best. Very long on academically oriented name dropping and plenty of repetition - feels like the book is 30% longer than it needed to be.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The interface is not user friendly and the free books are the same as you get with the cheep E-readers advertised on the internet.  I don't have a Kindle reader but since they offered free E-books and the reader supposedly works on a PC or an Android tablet I gave it a try.  I don't have any specific details that I don't like but can only say that I prefer Mobi Pocket reader or Over Drive Media Console. I guess it works good on a kindle reader so that's where you wold expect it to shine.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a wild ride, on the one hand we've got this incredibly hyper violent bike gang made up of some really good guys. Seriously who would NOT want to go out for a beer with jackson, Opie, Chips, Scotty, Juice or Bobby Elvis?? Clay is another matter. Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many \\"oh s***\\" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring. I guarantee that if you buy the series you will be up all night watching it, simply to see what happens next. Highest possible rating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's a very fun and game with fast reactions needed the only thing I don't like is how trains appear out of nowhere and glitch through stopped trains and barriers otherwise it's addicting and a challenge.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This a good book that is both drama and a cute romance.It keeps your attention  through out and I would certainly recommend it as a good but not to deep easy to read book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I guess this is a series that is going to go on indefinitely - love the characters as they evolve and there is no end to the suspense.  Look forward to the next book in the chronicles.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The last book in the series comes out in a week. I can't wait. This is better than 50 shades!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book, along with its sisters by far is one of the best ever produced for mass audience - it made me read cover to cover - it just wish I could go back and forth to the maps like I did with the paperback editions of the earlier books.
B0091THDOM|3.0|Update after writing the review I found out that the case is under a lifetime warranty, and I was able to get new one.  Hope that I just got a dud<br /><br />I loved this case when I first got it maybe two or three months ago, because I could keep my phone completely covered in my pocket from anything happening to it...no more keys scratching my screen.  then just the other day I go to put my phone in the case just like every other day and it won't go down in it whatever they have down there to make the phone come up when you pull the tag has now made it to where the phone will only go down to a little bit lower then what the picture they have shows<br /><br />won't be buying another one
B001LF3YQK|3.0|This Skip Hop Swipe wipes case works okay for me. It will do the job for the meanwhile. I'll say the price matches the product.<br /><br />Pros: it hold a good amount of wipes for a short period of time for outings, easy to use when refilling, has a strap that you can clip onto anything (stroller, daiperbag), dispense one wipe at a time, stays moist<br /><br />Cons: the sliding circular lid occasionally slides itself out of position and is unsecured at times (it pops off)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really excited to read this book. I really got into the book in the beginning, then the second half. The second half of the book was disappointing. I don't want to give anything away but I really hated the way this book ended.<br />I did like the story it was very twisted and so were the characters. It is definitely a eye opening book because it takes you one way and then completely takes you another way. You really get into the characters heads.  Overall it wasn't that bad of a book but I guess I don't get all the hype.
B001A5HBAG|4.0|good - finally caught up with the story line - - - forgotten some of it over the seasons, will buy season two as well
1863514260|5.0|Beautiful, outstanding and inspiring the viewer to not only follow the author's suggestions, but to use some of the great ideas to create with other media.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Wonderfully funny, yet very personal as well.  Loved the fact that Tina tried to minimize embarrassment of Sarah Palin.  Tina has a real heart.
B009NY43NY|1.0|It was not terribly interesting throughout. It lacked much of the sense of humor the earlier novels had.  Let's hope the show does better.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really like this game I had a shorter version and am happy that I got the full addition.  This is one game you do not have to be in the internet to play.  Since I have limited access to the internet some of the games I can not get to play much.  It is a game that I would recommend to everyone.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|This album is almost all synth unlike their other records. The songwriting is kind of taking the same mood that I feel passion pit's most recent album has taken which is &#34;We're depressed, but we're going to attempt to write the same kind of bubble gum music we've always written.&#34; Guess what... it didn't work out too good. None of the songs have a same kick that the old ones had and there's nothing terribly different there to replace it. It's like listening to songs from 1901 except they took out all the good parts. The verses on most of the songs are good enough, but the choruses are just boring as all get out. I've had this CD in my car stereo for about a month now and I've really tried to like it, and while some parts have grown on me, the majority have turned me off entirely.
B000VTNLBU|3.0|It's fun to think about what the human psyche and meaning+mode of life really is, and seeing movies about various people's takes on it is a rare treat. They threw violence into the story to keep the average audience entertained (in my opinion), but it seemed a little distracting and unnecessary to someone who's trying to enjoy the story simply as a psychiatric si-fi mystery; especially the first scene. You don't need people passing away horrifically to make a good story. But I still liked it over all!<br /><br />There were some scenes which, I guess, were supposed to set a mood and build the audience's empathy for the main characters through... slow scenery and shrill music... meh...  It just took away time they could have used on story building. Sometimes I even found myself wishing the characters could converse just a little bit faster. But it didn't seriously hurt the movie experience for me; just dried it up a tad.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|THANKS!  You made me &#34;the cool&#34; Gran B!  Arrived packaged securely and in excellent condition.  My grandson is ECSTATIC over his birthday gift!
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is ok.  I don't think I will continue playing it.  I am taking it off the kindle because I have other games I like better
B009NY43NY|3.0|Book seems unfinished, rushed, like the author was just slapping something together to get done.  Not her usual enjoyable style.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This movie was fun to watch.  We heard a lot of good things about the movie and were not disappointed.
B0061QD88S|5.0|This movie will never grow old.  For all your kids and grandkids ...<br />And the &#34;KID&#34; in all of us !  Awesome !
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This is a fantastic little mixer. I have had it now for about 8 months and I am always impressed with the design and clean sound.  The only thing that would make it better is if they would add a Kensington Lock Slot for a little security.  I wish there was a rack mount version of it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie really does the book justice. Although there were parts in the book I found crucial missing the overall message and theme is beautifully portrayed.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Enjoy playing all games that has anything to do with matching.would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys games that consist of matching pictures
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is a true classic ... Alda and Burstyn are excellant.<br />Nice to relive the happenings over the years as the characters develop ...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was a great series, but that is where it ends.  You offer nothing else that interests us in the slightest.  And you offer Downton Series 3 for $2.00 a pop even though we pay $79.00 per year for your offerings.  We saw a few others that might have caught our interest, but they too were $2.00 a pop.  You cannot attract us to your service like that.  Your competitors do much better.  You left a bad taste in our mouthes.  You did not even segregate those that were pay per view from those that were free under the annual fee.  From our standpoint you are sailing on a sinking ship with policies like that on your streaming videos.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The ending to this series ended feeling very forced. I got the impression that the last couple chapters were written first and the remainder of the novel was used to get as close to that point as she could, while keeping within a certain page count.<br /><br />It was a quick read, but one that I ultimately would have rather left open to my imagination on how it should end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Done by the love of the love of its new and relax at a time of the problems with this year
0060581808|5.0|My 7 year old son had to use this book in school. We went thru the chapters together and the simple language yet vivid details with which the author has described the day to day life of little Laura and her family is beautiful. It was very insightful for my son. He kept comparing how kids live in our world today and how life used to be for them then, in the late 1800s.<br />I bought this book for my 8 year old niece too and she too loved the book.<br />My favorite part is the story Pa tells Laura about the sleigh he and his brothers built and their first ride on it.
B000FC146C|5.0|McCullough has is author to one of the greatest books of this century.  It is truly a great vision. a vision of love, pain, history and prose, all put together in a way that will live in the minds of men and women for centuries. She pours her soul into this book and sucked mine in with hers.  She stands with Mitchner to tell a story within a history and flesh out the characters until I loved every one of them. I laughed with her and I cried with her as the pages sped past. Even though I saw the mini-series it was not until I read the words that I understood the philosophy that was imparted into my own life, and undoubtedly it will be to yours as well.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game brings the best of old school 8 bit gaming with a match three game.  Could be lots of fun for young kids too.
B000ID1J0E|3.0|Maybe Hunter S should just stay safely in the bookstore. I get the feeling that the director and the players were all enjoying each others company. Slapping each others back for each zanny idea and improv. Not a bad movie I may even watch it again see if it was just my mood but really it was just too much...everything.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for Daft Punk to return; and they do not disappoint! The track \\"Instant Crush\\" expresses it all.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Patrick Jayne is such a likeable character my husband and I found ourselves watching one episode after another.  Can't wait to watch the next episode!
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I enjoyed the game.  It's got a good bit of challenge to it early on and doesn't get boring.  Thanks!
B00CRW2066|5.0|This album continues the National's production of quality work -- this seems like the most polished production-wise to date.  It took me a few listens to really get into it, but the more I hear it, the more I want to spin it again (and have).  There are a couple of clear standout tracks (Don't Swallow the Cap and Graceless), but their are a lot of other gems that reveal themselves upon continue listening (I should live in Salt, I need my girl... really most of the songs).  I recommend to anyone who has enjoyed the National in the past.<br /><br />I do suggest listening at least once alongside the lyrics, as some of the singing is indecipherable, and the lyrics really are rather good.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am very sad that the series is over but I loved the way it ended! I hope the the relationship between Sam & Sookie works out!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I enjoy the old world story and like following families through time. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B00C70FG2S|4.0|If you are looking for aggressive tunes look else where, this album is more 'mellow' then 'death' but it is not a bad thing. Stanne is a great singer and sounds awesome on songs like 'State of Trust'. There are a quite a  few songs with clean vocals and  piano  mixed with guitars and drums and if you are a fan of Projector, you should not mind. Not all the songs are ballads, there are also some killer head bangers like 'Apathetic', 'Weight of the End', and 'The Science of Noise'. The US only bonus tracks are great too. Immeroial is another classic DT head banger and Photon Dreams is a instrumental. DT always changes up their style, if they did not they would be boring. I am glad they sound so refreshing and cool for a band that has been around for 20 years.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|everything about this app is freaking amazing. i dont see why someone wouldnt get it O.o with just one tap i can see everything i need on my device. works great with kindle fire &lt;3
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have ever read.  I could hardly put it down.  It tells it like it is, the good, the bad and the ugly.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I was late in discovering Game of Thrones even though I have HBO. But after all the talk I had to check it out and start from the beginning. I started with Netflix but because my wife and I were too excited to wait for the next disks to arrive we purchased episodes on Amazon.com. Can't wait until season 3 is available.
B000PVAFT0|4.0|What is not to like, it's the ocean?  Well worth the time to watch and learn more as you go.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great show. Can't wait until season 3…very creative and fun. Love the peter pan angle and Mr. Gold / son plot
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The best star trek movie hand down. Better than any of the others. It had action, a great story, it was funny...it had it all. Could not ask for more. I loved how it played off of the second star trek movie.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This book is not as good as George R. R. Martin's first three books. It feels like he is milking out the series once it became popular with the HBO series. This book has character viewpoints from the most least interesting and most hated characters (in my opinion). The story has nothing going on with no plot movement till the last third of the book with the most anticlimatic ending. Why Martin decide to split it in two instead of one book is beyond me and not at least have some of the main character POVs from the first three books. This book as almost all new POVs with minor characters that don't have even a name. I am disappoint in this book but I hope the next book is better.
B0086700CM|1.0|Temple run game never downloaded, kept getting message  about process has stopped unexpectedly . please try again I  tried several times to no avail.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Not sure I would have paid the money a theater wants, but it was definitely worth renting! The daddy group made me think of my brothers. Also, the cast was great. Loved all the personas. Funny for chicks and the man folk.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this season. It is so informative. As everyone else wasn't expecting the ending. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've been waiting for an album to blow me away this year, and this is it! Be warned: don't expect the usual Daft Punk electronic dance big-beat arena-shakers here. This album is what I like to call mellow robot disco aka vocoderchillfunk. It's so cool to listen to, and I can't stop. So, relax and enjoy!
B0036UMM84|4.0|Barbra Streisand is always amazing. If you enjoy her music you will enjoy this movie. Excellent acting. Predictable ending due to amount of heavy drinking and drug use of Kristofferson. Sad but realistic considering pressures of show business. Recommended
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was amazing........a real page turner that I couldn't put down.......even better than The Kite Runner.<br />Sorry my journey with these characters is over.
1881273156|4.0|The book was in great condition which was a plus. When I read the book it helped a lot to realize that I love differently and so does my partner. I suggest this for people who need help with their relationships or who want to learn to love better. Has a Christian setting so might not be appropriate for some people if that's not their belief.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Love this watch.  Looks nice and keeps accurate time.  Could not be any happier with this watch, I wear it everyday.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's a good game for youngsters who like animals and helping. Not really for older kids, but elementary age kids will love it!
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This game is truly AWESOME! The graphics have an old arcade-like feel to them, and still look amazing. This game has never crashed, had any bugs, glitched out, or done anything weird once. It works flawlessly, and is really fun to play. I recommend this to anyone that can tap a screen.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its ok I really like the. chat mode and that's why I give it four stars. something I don't like is the energy use and you get kicked out sometimes
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I can't stop reading these books!  I read the first one and could not wait to download the others.  It is a mixture of all of my favorite books rolled into one. It is worth the read.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|This game is a copy of world at arms in world at arms you do the<br />Exact same thing and world at arms  was made before it
B009LMTDL0|4.0|It's quite impressive the way Sheryl brings the insight of a female senior executive... For me it was like preaching to the core, but there are a lot of women that will take a lot from this book....
B002M87W2W|4.0|Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien were fabulous. the ending of the movie wasn't well written. I wish &#34;John&#34; had a song. Love the costuming and music.
B003R50FRI|4.0|This books takes you on a journey through different parts of India, it's culture and people. I found it very interesting.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Need a refund or done with this app store. Minecraft is more fun than this app this game is unacceptable for me.
B007SGM084|1.0|Never felt so cheated as after reading this book, can I have my money back, please?!?! C'mom, any Harlequin story beats this crap 10 times
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy simply playing solitaire to break monotony. not interested in advanced format puzzles when just killing time. great game for &quot;quick break&quot;.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Catching up and this season two is a roller coaster of a ride from laughable to dramatic! It won't disappoint and Cranston has come a long way from King if Queens!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I am a big Daniel Day Lewis fan, but was disappointed in this movie because it was way too long, his voice was high pitched, Sally Field's range of emotion is the same in every movie she's ever been in, and overall, just a boring movie.  What was the point?
B008OM0EDO|5.0|If you take everything seriously this movie is not for you.  Like Borat, this movie is full of great lines and laughs
B0084I2PEO|5.0|This book sucked me in just like The Kite Runner.  If you liked that one you will like this one.  I couldn't put it down!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was captivated from page one, well almost. I hope this story continues, and if it does, I am going to buy it. Can't wait!!!
B004SVM7BW|2.0|I can't tell if the app itself will work (it sounds really like a neat app) but the Test Drive feature does not have any access to any PDF files so you can't actually test drive the app at all. I am unwilling to waste money on an app that has no trial version and no test drive. Sadly this is not the only app that has a broken Test Drive feature. It is a great idea in theory but if you don't actually populate the test enviroment with the right kind of files, it won't work.
B004V9MU86|5.0|A wonderful book written from an unusual perspective.! Thought provoking.It is unusual to read a book fro the ordinary German unbiased  person.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book.  I understand it is hard to end such a wonderful series, but please don't waste my time and money.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Great..easy to use app. Reminds me of Mario on regular Nintendo. Fun to play! Very easy to learn as well!
1439153663|5.0|Beautifully written. I fell in love with the characters and finished in one day. I woke up feeling down knowing that I wouldn't be able to visit Kitchen House today and anticipating all the drama unfolding in their lives.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Plot lines are very well written.  The actors do an exceptional job; the characters are &#34;fleshed out&#34; well - showing both the good and bad points of their personalities.  The legal plots always engage me, as do the personal lives of the characters.  I  am a big fan!!!
B009B50QOU|1.0|This is Green Days worst album ever and Dos and Tres is not much better. Each album of the 3 discs put out back 2 back, have maybe 1 to 3 good songs at most. I suggest Dookie, and American Idiot as their best but I do like all of their work up until these last 3 discs they put out.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I never watched Fringe when it was on network TV as I can't sit through all the endless commercials but on Amazon there are no inturuptions and the episodes are suspenseful and such fun  to watch.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I like the whole album. He is very good. I would recommend this album to all my friends. The End
B009KEN87O|3.0|makes you think of the old time space invaders, sort of.  Could still use some work to make it a little more up to date but keeping the old school feel
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. As the parent of a Bipolar young adult it brought back bad memories before she was diagnosed. We saw it together and at times cried. Life at times is still a struggle for her.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I know I read a lot, but, do not like almost daily recharging this : so I wish the charge stayed longer....
0525952926|2.0|Was very disappointed in the book's condition.  The cover was sticky and a lot of the pages were dirty and spotted.  Felt like my hands were dirty after reading it.  The story was great.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Remarkable story that is brilliantly acted; felt as if being a voyeur was justified in watching the story unfold.  Amazing dialogue and inspiring; truly revealed the impediments to having a successful sexual encounter as well as depicting the difficulties faced by someone who is handicapped in this manner.
B00BFBSV72|3.0|I got this for a friend to play on my kindle. He is enjoying it a lot and plays it ever time he is around me.
B000V39KDO|5.0|If you are female keep looking; if you are male then this movie might be for you. The movie is action packed with adequate acting and rivers of human blood. If your contemplating the movie a again, it'll be just as good as the first time......up to 300 times. enjoy!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|We showed the movie at an outdoor neighborhood get-together that we do annually. The quality of the picture and sound were very good. The next day we had time to watch all the extra features that we included in this Special Collector's Edition. Kudo to the company we bought it from. They were excellent as well.
B006IVBSBU|5.0|for such an old flick the price left a bad taste in my mouth, why the price is so much, I don't know, I hope amazon will be more reasonable in the future with OLD movies.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Good movie, I gave it a 4 because they don't have a 3.5. All and all good plot, action scenes, and acting. Bonus they had Mila Kunis trying to sleep with mac daddy Denzel. Hot chicks cool flicks, check it out.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|All the elements to what propelled AIC into alt rock superstardom are evident here. Warped out guitars, harrowing sounds, moody lyrics, and beautiful harmonies. Jerry Cantrell's guitar work has never been better, the band has never sounded tighter. This is their second album in a row I can listen to every track without skipping. While I love their 90's work, it got tiresome and depressing sifting through the drugged out lyrics. They've fortunately moved past that stage in their career and are stronger for it. I miss Staley, but DuVall has filled his shoes in a highly complimentary way. I absolutely love this album.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|Movie is fun to watch but slow in some parts.  Lots of blood but little more.  Left me wondering why I rented this movie.
B0018OFN1S|4.0|Well if you like rice rockets and love to drive fast, you would like this movie. Vin Diesel plays a good role along with that guy all the girls are crazy about, ya what's his name, lol. Well if your 16-25 and given you like cars, rice rockets, then you might find this movie as entertaining as me.
B006885FZI|5.0|This makes Band of Brothers look like a paint ball event. This series is very realistic and captures what these Marines went through.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a fun addictive game that keeps challenging you to do better every time you play it. I think everyone should try it
B00124PXW8|5.0|By far the most scary movie I've ever watched. If you believe in god you will find yourself going to church Sat. and Sun. If your looking for a movie designed my our military leader in foreign psychological warfare then this movie is made for you. Ever sound, color, and effect is made from your worst fears. Watch with caution!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is such a good book!!! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the third one to come out!
B00932A4XE|5.0|Enjoyed the fun movie that showed many sides of pregnancy and having babies.  There were serious moments and funny ones.
B001609SQA|5.0|This is the real Aliens Movie, not the knock off. Great acting, award winning graphics and effects. Highly recommend this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|My first reaction was to question why the characters behaved as they did. As the author delved into what formed their habits and personalities, the &#34;why&#34; developed into empathy and gave rise to hope for them.
B003XYERRM|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I could hardly put it down. I didn't want it to end.  It does make a person almost cry though - I just felt so bad for Richard iii.  I wanted so much for him to escape.  The characters all seemed real and present.  The author's descriptions of clothing, surroundings etc. were wonderful. Stanley demonstrated Mark Twain's comment on the difference between a dog and a man.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|The plot on this movie will move you. Fans of &#34;300&#34; and &#34;Running Man&#34; will like this movie. It's a well known movie compared to brave heart with its emotional content. I enjoyed the movie and recommend it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I've gotten hooked! I just recently started reading Lee Child's  Reacher novels and I haven't read one yet that I didn't really enjoy. The stories are always intriguing and I find them hard to put down. I highly recommend the entire series.  I'm off to start #14 right now.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|..we have a mature artist that's not trying to compete against the teeny-boppers out there.  Nothing is worse than when you have an older and established artist try to burst back onto the music scene in a fashion that just cries \\"I'm desperate, look at me be like Britney Spears!\\"  I first heard that Agnetha had a new album out a few weeks ago when I happened to stumble upon the video for When You Really Loved Someone and I was most impressed.  Not only with Agnetha's voice but the subject matter of the song and the video.  It wasn't flashy or overdone.  It seemed rather minimalistic and rather classy.  Seeing Agnetha in that concert hall singing was definitely the best part of the video.  She looked and sounded so confident.  It was almost as if she were saying \\"Look ladies, I can still sing like the rest of you and I don't have to flash my stuff all around and have my voice so tampered with that I sound like a robot.\\"  Now, I am not saying that I have anything against autotune or anything, but I think that you should only really use it when you have established that you can sing.  I mean, we all know Agnetha can sing, and she still can, really good, so I wouldn't criticize her for using a little autotune here and there.<br /><br />Ok, well, now I will start talking about the album, and not just about how awesome Agentha is :-).<br /><br />From what I have heard, The One Who Loves You Now was the first international single. This is a good song.  A ballad, and nothing too fancy.  Agnetha's voice is crystal clear here, sounding just as it did in ABBA days, the only thing that disappoints me about this song is that it never really \\"peaks\\".  She sings it great and just when you think it's about to get there, it just kinds peters away.  Good song none the less.<br /><br />When You Really Loved Someone:  Starts out with some nice acoustic guitar and a little harmonica, and then her vocals sweep in beautifully.  She sings the first verse and then she belts out the chorus and it just blows you away.  This song is a little more produced than the first song. More electronics and less real instruments.  Should be a rather big hit on the Adult Contemporary chart as long as the record label promotes it.<br /><br />Perfume on The Breeze:  Very ABBAish song.  Almost has a \\"hippie\\" sound to it.  I know that's not the right word, but it's close.  Another in a long line of songs about short-lived love affairs with one hoping for the other to return.  Around the 2:28 mark you will notice some distortion in the vocals that really keep this song from sounding dated.<br /><br />I Was A Flower:  One of my faves on this cd.  I think we have all felt this way about a lover one time in our life.  Felt like we weren't treated the best and were left a little damaged, or \\"faded\\" as Agnetha puts it.  This is one of those songs that you will just want to sing along with, even with the depressing subject matter.  She puts so much emotion into singing this song, you can feel her pain.  In some parts of the song she sounds strong, as if what she was singing about didn't bother her, and then she sounds hurt and weak, almost like the \\"heartbreak to hate\\" feeling some feel after a relationship ends.<br /><br />I Should Have Followed You Home:  A beautiful duet.  I have never heard of Gary Barlow before but the two make a powerhouse team.  The song starts out pretty slowly, like a normal duet/ballad.  But once the first verse is done and the chorus kicks in, the music picks up.  Has ALMOST a club song feel.  It actually reminds me of a song that would be on a newer Fleetwood Mac album.  Has the acoustic and real instrument sound but you can hear the electronic music in the background too.  Good song about 2 people meeting one night and then losing track of each other.<br /><br />Past Forever:  Yes, that really is a long long time!! Who doesn't want a love that lasts past forever?  Very simple song.  Just your regular ballad.  Nothing really special here except thequality of Agnetha's voice again.  Sounds superb.<br /><br />Dance Your Pain Away:  This song does totally feel out of place on this album.  I love it, though.  You go from ballad to ballad to ballad to total retro-disco.  I could listen to this song for hours.  One thing about retro sounding songs, if you produce them right, they sound retro but also very modern.  I personally love disco-esque songs that are produced today.  They sound like disco but the beat and production values are usually way better.  Anyways, this song is a sure fire dance floor hit.  I mean, yeah, they have tampered with her voice and produced the hell of it, but what great song isn't that way???  Definitely my favorite song on this cd.  Remix this the right way and it could shoot to the top of the Billboard Club Singles chart.<br /><br />Bubble:  I like this song and the meaning behind it.  Musically this sounds very much like a Kylie Minogue or Kerli ballad.  Not sure exactly how to describe it.  Just a modern pop ballad.  I just thing the word \\"bubble\\" is the wrong word to be used in the song.  Just sounds a little out of place, or maybe just kind of silly.  Good song though, nothing bad about it.<br /><br />Back On The Radio:  Are you really, Agnetha??  I think so.  This song has a good beach feel to it.  Good song to be sitting out in the sun and sipping a margarita or something.  Her voice has definitely been tampered with/polished.  Not saying it's bad thing, makes the song sound very modern.<br /><br />I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed:  If I had to pick a least favorite song, it would be this one.  Not really sure why.  It's just a ballad, nothing special.  Maybe its the' electric guitar and acoustic guitar together?  I'm not saying I dislike this song, I am just saying that there is something about it that just seems \\"off\\" to me.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a solid effort and a great return to form.  I am sure that her many fans will be pleased with this album, as Iam.  I know it is doing well on the international charts, hopefully it gets the recognition it deserves here in the States.
B00A6F9YFQ|5.0|Great album, so different from the rest.  Can't wait until their next one comes out this month.  Unfortunately they are not stopping in my city on their US tour
B009NY43NY|4.0|This is an end to a great series.  I must admit I had gotten a little bored with the last few books, but this one although a slow start was very interesting and seemed to tie up loose ends.  Sookie is as alway conflicted in what she wants.  Great summer read I won't ruin the story line for you.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was good. Although I am always disappointed when at the end of a series, everything is settled and hunky-dorey, it is unrealistic
B008LZYR0A|5.0|The song winners was so appropriate for the Olympics.  I was so happy that GB won so many metals that year.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game easy to use.  Everyone likes it.  Great to keep kids occupied in cars and waiting rooms.  Would recommend to anyone
B009CF7GRY|2.0|So much potential there. Awesome music, a take on a classic. It could have been so beautiful, it could have been so great. Casting was terrible and the lead lady's part was butchered. I feel sad for all that it could have been. If you watch it not expecting anything, you may like it, or almost like it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Different types and challenges of matching and you have a choice of timed or &quot;Zen&quot; which is not timed. And then you get to build the tree of life as an extra feature.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app on the free app of the day well because it was free and ive gotta say...  the sounds are fabulous... u cant hear a loop at all- its done really well! And the layout is perfect... Ive tried so many types of sound apps and this one is by far the most superior!! Thank you! I would definitely pay for it!
