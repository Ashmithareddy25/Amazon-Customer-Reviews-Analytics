B004XVN1T4|5.0|I love spy novels. Follett is the master. This one is just great. Should be done shortly. I must have read all of his work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Coolest book and saddest book EVEER!<br />Loved the suspence. Really was a tear jearker. I give this book five stars.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|But I am waiting for volume three hoping  that Ken can muster up some more excitement and power into it. Volume 2 was somewhat bland.
1455519006|3.0|It's OK at best. The plot seems to take many unrealistic turns. So much so that eventually, it becomes hard to believe.
0345803485|4.0|Generally speaking, this is not my kind of book and I had NO intention of ever reading it.  What made me finally give in was curiosity.  I'll admit I do enjoy romance and hopeful romance so maybe that's part of it.  Okay, so it is not very well written and reads like a very young author wrote it, but, from the get go I was intrigued.  Yes, the main male character Christian Grey seems far too young to be a self made billionaire but I guess with so many younger million/billionaires these days, it could be possible I suppose.  The fact that he is also gorgeous, is well endowed, sexually adept, is a great pianist, flies a helicopter & glider and speaks fluent french is like a young woman's dream guy!  Wow!  To be filthy rich, drop dead gorgeous, etc, etc, etc.  Yeah, a bit unbelievable.  But it's a fantasy so...<br /><br />Some of the things that annoy me was the constant \\"flushing\\", as well as \\"Oh my\\" and other quips repeatedly coming from Anastasia's mouth.  I wonder if the author tried too hard to show her naiveté by having her say the same darned things so often?!  Ugh.  I took away one star for the writing style and repetitiveness that was more of an annoyance.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found Christian's mysterious persona intriguing enough to want to find out more about him and why he is the way he is.  Yeah, and I learned a few things too, **** plug? what the heck is THAT?,  I refuse to google it!  But I found myself having difficulty putting  down my Kindle...in fact I stayed up past midnight just to finish it last night!  I did not expect that ending, but it makes sense and I look forward to picking up the second book of this trilogy!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This my favorite game and enjoy playing it in my spare time and while watching television.  It keeps my mind busy
B005GG0MIS|3.0|I am sure that to some, this must be a facinating book but to me, it is rather boring and an effort to finish.  If it were not our book club choice, I would not persue it.  Too many other interesting books to read and I am many years passed being in school where assigned books are required reading.
0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" gives us the perspective of a special operations warrior om the mission .<br />Shows how imporant flexibility (no plan survives contact with the enemy) and a remarkable focus on the mission. A VERY good read.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|II'm a big fan of Maroon 5 anyway, so it's no surprise that I love this CD.  I do much prefer the original lyrics over the edited ones.  Great CD!
B00957T6X6|5.0|This a torture. To read these books and have to wait for the end is worse than being flayed (not really). It is painful though. The scope of the world Martin has created rivals what Tolkien accomplished. The characters are sometimes too human with all their triumphs and failings. I can't wait to read how it all resolves.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Fascinating read about Ozzy ! He came from humble beginnings,only to become one of the most recognizable individuals on earth today . A great performer ! This is an honest history of his life . Highly recommended !
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The film has good production values, which is the only positive thing I can say about it. Several interesting themes emerge. However, nothing weaves together to make a story. Don't waste your time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book:) I found it very hard to put it down so I could go to sleep! Would love to see the movie.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Watch this movie.  It's a fascinating story.  I haven't read the book, but this oscar winning film was definitely worth 2 hours of your time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game. I can spend hours playing it and take out my aggression on the birds to help relax after a bad day!
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|I'm kinda confused by the ending...is Grace a wolf or forever a human? If human is she leaving Sam to go to school? Are they going to be together?? All in all..good series. Thank you.
B00130UFY2|4.0|This wasn't as good as Bourne Identity but was action pact which is always good for me as well as some of the fighting scenes were well choreographed.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a can't-put-it-down read.  If you have spring cleaning you are planning to do, don't pick this book up.  You will not be cleaning today.  Very well written, attention-grabbing right from the first page.  I have read this book once before, and just recently, reluctantly gave away the hard copy book. However, through the magic that is Kindle, I will always have a copy and can read and enjoy this book over and over again, whenever I feel like<br /><br />sparkysmom
B000002J0N|4.0|Not my favorite CSN disc, but I like it.  I bought it on a whim and I'm glad I did.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was well written, suspenseful, and even a little bit disturbing, which kept it &#34;real&#34; for me.  It kept me guessing and moved me at the same time.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I pre-ordered this disc after listening to the samples.  He does a great job on the covers and I really like the new songs.  It's been weeks and I can't stop listening to it!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|The story telling plus the scientific research that discusses the undeniable health benefits of running - made me a runner for life! This is a very fun read for non-runners, as well - but I don't know how you could read this and NOT become a runner :)
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I am a high school teacher. This book really got me thinking about what we need to be thinking about in terms of what really helps students succeed after high school. Spoiler alert: the answer is working on character skills - like grit and curiosity. Helping students graduate is important, but if we don't help students develop these traits, they are not much more likely to succeed in college and in the workplace.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a lot of fun and addicting. I would like to see more challenges.But overall a great of fun.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The actress in this series could stand alongside Idris Elba for best actor in a series.<br />Tight writing like Luther but with a much stranger plot. My wife and I love it. We<br />are Dr. Who fans and watch a large amount of BBC programing for those who<br />live the USA. I loved Copper, Luther, Life on Mars, We both loved Coupling, Black's Books,<br />Fawlty Towers, Red Dwarf and many others. However, after the first episode we turned to each<br />other and said wow. That was only 45 minutes. The show has so much going on and is so<br />tightly written as to be a rollercoast of storyline development.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I've only purchased one thing from amazon as of yet but there will certainly be more orders from me coming soon! I ordered a guitar strap that I feel I got a great deal on, and it arrived super quick! I will definitely be using amazon in the future!!!
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|and this one is a pretty good example of the type<br /><br />one thing i would love to see added - some 'ideas for bridges', or basic tutorial section suggesting 'simple design types' - something that gave more of an 'instructional' tone to the app<br /><br />still, all in - i like it and will play  quite a bit
B004SIP7S0|5.0|A wonderful movie about Frida and Diego Rivera!  Saw it many years ago, but a wonderful refresher before seeing their exhibit at the High Museum.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon had me at hello......Mr D & D is complicated but you love him...Sylvia Day has a way of drawing you in......
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Wonderful to see the movie on DVD.  A real keeper that we will enjoy for years and will pass on to my children.
B00B4EPM4U|5.0|Stallone has some nice movies that don't get the recognition they deserve. i have watched this movie several times. It is a good presentation of overcoming obstacles to stay a father.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|It's stoopid to get excited about a flashlight, but this one is just that good! It's so strong it lights up the dark side of the moon!! Seriously- it's an awesome flashlight and the shipping was rapido fast ... i am well pleased!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It works smoothly, and I like the style and format of the screens, notifications and alerts. I highly recommend it!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee has always been funny, sad, enormously entertaining.  Music is medicine.  But now I see that the message is deeper and greater, and it is working.  The message to young and old alike, but particularly to the younger people is tolerance.  Its anti-bullying message is strong.  It encourages people to move out of tight little &#34;security&#34; groups and to find and encourage the wonderfulness of others.  Gleek is a strong word.  Many have found acceptance as the stories continue.  The program continues to invite us to love and care for those who are in no way like us.  The message is subtle and constant.  Forgiveness and reconciliation occur many times.  I've enjoyed very much giving these episodes a second look, as I watch the unfolding of tolerance in our country.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This biographical period movie was wonderful. I enjoyed the adaptation.  I've read so much non-fiction about Queen Victoria and her daughters.  This rang true.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I love this movie. It was great at the theater and had to have it in my video library. Brings a new insight to some of the characters we believe in when we were kids and still believe in.
B004SUDQ8Q|3.0|Mostly native actors, but did believable job. Would watch again, but would not watch often. If I showed it to children below 10, their parents would probably be upset, as it is anxiety producing. It's about reality, so there are no happy endings.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My daughters and I are addicted.  We missed part of the season, so we had to buy it online, we couldn't wait for reruns.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|It was supposedly a true story, and I can believe that. But it was more like a true situation, not a whole story. A man gets a dog, they love each other, the dog waits for him every day to come home from work and when the man dies, the dog keeps waiting in the same place until he dies.  Scenery nice, actors good, just situation was not enough to make it worth watching the whole movie. Would have made a good U-tube, or news story. Plus, it was a downer.
B00519YRH2|5.0|My 19 year old son had never seen it entirely. We watched together. It was just as good as the first time,<br />great characters. You can easily see a 13 year old boy functioning through a 30 year old body. Hanks is a talent, then and now.
0316228532|2.0|If this book was written by someone other than J.K. Rowling I never would have looked twice at it. Maybe I should have gone with that instinct. This book was over 500 pages of waiting for something to happen.<br /><br />Let me give credit where credit is due. Rowling develops amazing characters. The Casual Vacancy is about a small town where everyone knows each other, they are certain their little town in the best place on earth, and things fall apart when one person unexpectedly dies. Rowling takes us deep into the psyche of about a dozen of these townspeople, young and old, and she does it remarkably well. Each of them has some dark emotional issue that they are dealing with, and they are written so well that it made me wonder whether Rowling herself could be sane to be able to portray them so well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these characters never seem to really do anything. We read hundreds of pages of their daily lives with some minor drama, but the final climactic moment has little to do with everything else that has taken place. That's not completely true. The rest of the novel shows how every person is so wrapped up in their own little world that they either do not notice or do not care when tragedy is unfolding right before their eyes. They make us think about how easy it is to discount someone and decide they are not worth our time and effort. A valuable lesson, but one that Rowling took a long time in getting around to.<br /><br />If you are looking for an example of superb character development (say if you are a writer yourself), then I would recommend this book. Otherwise, you may spend hours turning pages thinking surely something is going to happen soon, only to be continually disappointed.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|loved it our book group overall loved it and liked the way the plot was developed overall liked everthing about it.Would recomend to friends.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely.  The story was very fast paced and never  boring.  I'm looking forward  to starting the next book in the series.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is okay, but I like both Block Story and Survival Craft better. Minecraft needs to smooth out the interface.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love everything he does...This album isn't FUTURE SEX/LOVE SOUNDS, but I still love it!! There's only one song on the album that I don't listen to in it's entirety.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy has written another very great book. I will probably read it again. I have read almost all of her books.
B0086700CM|5.0|The only way I go into the real world is for school that's it........ it's soooooo addicting...!! Love this game
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's the social connector. I have made a lot of friends there, and we have a lot of discussions. I don't care for all the ads though.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did! Well done...I found myself routing for Jennifer Lawrence's character.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Very interesting movie about struggle with drugs and addiction vs. a movie about plane crash.  Thought John Goodman was good in his role.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a great time killer. needs to have a better way harvest food, other than that it is a must have. add me as a friend lonewolfIX
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Started off slow, but sped up after about three episodes.  This is a very good program and I am glad that someone mentioned to me how good they thought this series was and I needed to watch.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Was looking for something informative on our history and a good story.  Got neither.  Don't waste your time watching this.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I don't play many games, but I like this one. Very addicting! I'll probably keep playing it for a while, until the game gods see fit to banish me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This novel grips readers with its twists and turns.  You feel compassion for the characters.  I cannot wait for book 3.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag goes with me everywhere because ALL my camera gear fits in it. Plus, because it's a backpack, taking it along doesn't seem like a burden at all. It's a great, quality bag with plenty of pockets, straps and storage to accommodate different gear.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|The lyrics are so poignant and the phrasing is gorgeous.  The sound is pop on the surface but more than that below. &#34;I couldn't be your friend&#34; hits me especially hard and rings so true.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has a Slow start, picks up momentum. I am 3/4 into the book and can't put it down. A fascinating theme!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very good period people story.  There are so many parallel stories going on that there is never a dull moment.  I have already bought the third season and viewed it as well.  Great entertainment.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Its a good game but the money cap goal on each bridge is ridiculous. Also not sure what the point of the car is if all the goals can be achieved with the truck.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|Not sure if its poor writing or poor acting; trys to be funny, but its not. Very disappointing movie to watch
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|For me-great diet.  Losing weight, little effort.  Fast days are not fun but not too hard.  Worth it if you can eat on the other 5 days.
B000NGTJTY|2.0|This is not the complete movie.  It is abridged!  I was disappointed.  If your are looking for the full version, this is not it.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|I only recently started to watch this show when my cable provider had a free HBO promotion-hooked after the first episode!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I just could not get into this book..maybe it's just not my type of book I like to typically read.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|I plan on playing this game again and my daughter, 11 yrs, also loves it.  Original.  Funny.  Relaxed fun.  I would like another like this one.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|First time round, I`m very excited! Classic Willie! With Mickey Raphael on harmonicaBilly & Paul English, Sister Billie pounding the keys, son Micah pitching in and of course THE GREAT Willie Nelson himself, how can you go wrong? Can`t wait to see you in Des Moines on May 14 at Civic Center! Be at least 5th time I`ve had the privalage to see Willie Live! What a treat! He`s an ICON if ever there was one! Please do &#34;Sisters Comin Home&#34;, at Civic Center! Already getting goose bumps listening to another FANTASTIC Willie Gem! WEEEEE-Dogeeez, Uncle Jed! Oh yea, Happy Birthday,too!
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|It's ok, It's a free app so i didn't expect too much, but i found another one that i like so this is been deleted.
B009OWE87Q|3.0|I think the previous negative reviews are much too harsh.  I let these reviews put me off and they shouldn't have.  No, it isn't deeply self reflective but it doesn't need to be. It's a book predominately about fashion and its a good read.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|It is a really good app easy to use even for people like me, and it's free. So i'm happy with it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I actually bought this box set several years ago unfortunately one of the disc became damaged and would no longer play so I replaced the entire set and do not regret it for a moment I adore these people and the murder stories are interesting I love a mystery Castle and Beckett make an excellent team of crime solvers and they are funny too
B00BF11STU|5.0|An interesting and inspiring movie that shows what our military and covert ops team do to protect the USA borders.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was amazing how teenagers could make such 'order' in the glade and the sacrifices they made, and every time I thought something was gonna happen they flipped it
B0083H6AQA|5.0|After watching the disastrous Cosmopolis I needed a good dose of RPatz. The cinema photography and costumes were extraordinary. A good DVD for the collection.
B008XBASVY|1.0|One dimensional writing, seems as though he is using this book to express all his bitter feelings from high school. Negative and depressing. Not for me.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|With Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe you can't go wrong. Add Cate Blanchett, William Hurt and Matthew MacFadyen for 2.5 hours of adventure, humor and a quiet love story. Getting the director's cut with the theatrical version was definitely a bargain.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very specific, so you know how much time you have left for each task (reading, Internet, camera, etc).  I like that you can change the color of the battery and set alerts. Overall, awesome app!!
B003TTCURU|5.0|Sometimes the writing is a bit contorted, but the stories are engrossing, and the actors are brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the BEST BIBLE APP I have ever used. Plenty of versions and it even reads to you. Get it today, it's Totally FREE!!!
1780721676|5.0|I heard about the program on NPR and it sounded like something that would work for me.  I've started it.  The book is an easy and fast read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When a company decides to jump into manufacturing something new sometimes the product suffers. I am delighted to report that this is not the case with the Anker High Precision laser Gaming Mouse. The quality of the construction of the mouse is very impressive. High quality rubber covers most of the mouse that is supple but not sticky as is the case with low quality rubber padding. The shape of the mouse makes it comfortable even for the large handed users like myself. It comes bundled with a software utility that allows you to customize the sensitivity and button layout and even allows you to change color of the logo to the rear of the mouse just as a fun add on. I can tell you that the responsiveness of the mouse has been excellent and a point of fact I have to turn down the sensitivity to about half it's maximum capability for the specific way I like to play FPS games.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a fantastic gaming mouse for an unbelievably low asking price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you know where this story is going, it twists and turns, and then it twists again!
B002P3RCVU|5.0|Bought it for a friend that enjoyed him in concert with me. She loved the vinyl. Good quality and sound. I Love you MB
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I had read and heard positive reviews on this movie and the story of Les Miserables. I was highly disappointed. It was hard to follow. I could not understand what people were saying. I gave up after 45 minutes.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|I am always amazed at how you can buy a product in todays computer world and have it plug in and work right off.  Of course the board looks like a fugitive from a Sci FI movie with all the heat piping and double fans,<br />However, somewhere it should warn you that you need an extra cable to connect into your tower power supply.  Don't forget to order it or you will be looking at computer with the new board in it balefully (your monitor will tell you to plug in the extra power cable) until the cable assy arrives.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This movie was a thriller, however it is one of those movies that stays with you. There were scenes in the movie that I still think about that haunt me. Definitely not a movie for the weak - or children.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Reviewing the Anker 2 Port Turbo Car Charger and enjoying using the best car charger I have found to date.<br />Being constantly on the quest for a better charger, Anker made this available to me to test and evaluate. Already having a small box of chargers that were supposed to be better than paved roads, I said \\"What the heck, sure\\", thinking that if this one performed like the others I have tried, it would join the others that didn't work up to expectations.<br />With the others, they did provide a charge if I had all day to leave our phones connected to them but who has the time for that?<br />Upon receiving the Anker Turbo Car Charger, I immediately noticed the printing on the box saying it is an 18 Watt, 3.6 Amp output device! The unit is packaged well with the ability to see the product. Sure looked small... Could this thing be real?<br />Removing it from the package yielded a very compact and solid built unit with a feel that I like. It does not have the cheap, almost ready to fall apart feel that most others have.<br />A quick read through the included manual made me want to plug it into the vehicle and start charging one of our phones. The first one I charged is my Galaxy Nexus phone. I have never seen a car charger get that battery to full faster than this one.<br />Not believing what I was seeing, connected my wife's Droid Charge with an aftermarket battery so large it takes a special back case. It was about 25% charged and in just less than 2 hours was reading 100%.<br />One further test was charging both phones at the same time and they charged as fast as they would have had they been connected to their home wall chargers, if not a bit faster. The perfect charger!<br />I really like the \\"smart\\" this charger has and how it can select the output current to each of the 2 ports, depending on the demand. I am happy to say I didn't overload it and cause the auto shutdown to kick in but it does have the ability to shut itself down if the output demand is abovespecifications.<br />Another nice sort of touch is that there is no onboard LED that tends to distract me while charging like the other ones did. No square of black tape over the LED on this one.<br />Should you buy a couple of these? You bet you should because if you are looking to end the slow charge times while driving, this charger is the one you have been looking for.<br />A few days ago, I took the charger to a dinner with some friends and showed it off to others that have the same complaints with the ones they currently use then found out the next day they ordered some of the Anker chargers for themselves.<br />The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of this product.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|Great book, well written with good intentions.  A MUST read for scientists, medical professionals, and laymen alike.  I highly recommend this book.  I will be using it with my undergraduate medical majors as a term project.

B009NYF2ES|5.0|I love this movie.  We wanted to add the Blu-ray version to our collection.  It is a movie that you can watch multiple times and enjoy it every time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a good game. I do think however that they need to cut out all the Facebook and social media crap.... I am on to play not discuss it with everyone or post endless rubbish for no one else to see.

B00A12VW86|4.0|I got this because my brother told me it was good. And it is! With most Green Day albums you get about half so-so songs, and half really great, memorable ones. This album is no different. Good all around music to kick off the start of summer!
B008RJ6TTC|3.0|I have watched the entirety of the Columbo series, everything included in this complete set. Basically, I was happy to continue watching because the show is consistently good, though rarely great.<br /><br />Columbo is eminantly likable, but paper thin. What do we get to know about him except he likes chili, is married, has a dog, has kids (mentioned exactly once, I think) and drives a Peugeot. We never even get a first name. His taste is middle brow; I think he bowls. Why does he drive a Peogeot?  This is never answered.  Even in the elongated movies, we get nothing more about him. we know more about his wife.<br /><br />What is not paper thin is his relationship with the perpetrator of the crime. The best episodes involve Columbo getting into the head of the perpetrator and leading him or her into incriminating him/herself. I am thinking of Columbo convincing Robert Vaughn to incriminate himself on the cruise liner. The key to good episodes is the actor playing the perpetrator of the crime, which is pretty strange for a crime drama (though i might call it a melodrama.) There are plenty of good actors in the role of the perpetrator.<br /><br />The show has a distinct formula - watch the crime commited, then wonder how Columbo will solve the crime. In some formulaic shows, like House MD, deviations from the norm lead to the best drama. This is not the case with Columbo. When a psychopath kidnaps Columbo's nephew's bride, Columbo never interacts with the criminal, and the attempt at high drama fails.<br /><br />One of my pet peeves is the intro to the non-movie episodes which contain tidbits of the show to follow. As someoe who has watched before, I don't want to be reminded of what is to follow; I try to ignore the intro.<br /><br />I might have given this a 4th star but the movies are lengthened with largely with filler and have many of the weaker stories.<br /><br />Columbo is not riveting, but is still a staple.

B008FPOIT6|3.0|Good enough for super light reading; nothing spectacular. I am required to write 12 more words for this review to be posted. I There they are.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|If you're a fan of Crichton, you'll enjoy this read.  As always, full of just-around-the-corner technology and action.  Nice page turner, both my wife and I liked it, and we were able to get our Crichton fix.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Well-written and interesting, particularly for those who love flowers.  But, at times, I had suspend belief to swallow<br />the story line.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I cant get enough of this show really I can watch it forever and not to mention this case is sweet!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I like EVERY song.  Jason Mraz is a new artist for me.  So, I consider this collection a great find.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its fun and challenging and this game rocks this game is worth the time at home chilling and playing Subway Surfers
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was very disappointed that Amazon did not choose to put Downton Abbey season 3 on their Prime streaming list.  I had to order it from Netflix.  Seems like a lot of the stuff I want to watch isn't included in the &#34;Thousands of free programs&#34; claim made by Amazon Prime!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I don't play alot of driving games because I am new too the kindle fire but I really like this Beach Buggy Blitz. Its easy to learn and fun to drive for beginners. I can't seem to keep it at times from going in the water but I'm sure that's just me. Any way I would give this to all of my friends to play cause I know they would love it as much as I do.
0385360177|5.0|these books kept me in the car all of the time. i did not want to stop driving. wow i hope E L James writes another series like 50 shades. enjoy!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun game no matter what you play it on but I love the kindle version the best. It is easy to learn and follow and adds hours of enjoyment to playing games on the kindle fire. I haven't tried all the ones that are available but this one is the best of the ones that I have tried.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The characters are not plausible and the plot is not believable.  The author's assumption that all readers understand French is disappointing along with other apparent assumptions about the readersi
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|great movie nothing to say bad obout the movie great scene th robot dancing doing the robot very very funny

B00008WT5C|5.0|Growing up on the Beatles and classical music in grammar school, I befriended some kids who were the tough kids. We all liked various rock 'n roll bands. One kid pulled out a cassette tape and stuck it in a portable stereo in the park one day. I heard Bad Boy Boogie for the first time. The Bon growl of lyrics,\\"I do the bad boy boogie all over town\\" immediately proved along with the tone and rythm of guitar, bass, and drums, hit me as a type of rock I'd never heard. It made me want it, but knew my parents would be outraged as a 5th grade kid listening to such delinquency. Lol. The fan affair began. No other band can compare with AC/DC. They are in a class all their own. They aren't a metal band. They are maximum rock and roll particular to the raw energy of Malcolm, Angus, Phil, Mark (on High Voltage), Williams, Bon (RIP), and Brian after Scott. No other group could do it like they did. One of the few bands I can say never lets you down when you buy any of their albums. Let There Be Rock was just the beginning for me.
0385742886|5.0|I love James Dashner's books, and when I saw The kill order I had to have it. When the item came I was really excited, it was in perfect condition, though the packaging looked like garbage, it protected the book perfectly.
0060245867|4.0|My daughter really enjoys this series of books. Glad to add this book to the collection. Its a cute series.

B00AE2LJVS|2.0|The storyline was weak and very little happened during the entire movie. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did.
B00AYJBS5I|5.0|Even after 12 years Jack Black and Kyle Gass' debut self titled album \\"Tenacious D\\" is still rockin with a perfect mix of satirical humor and...well...awesome music of course.<br /> The Vinyl edition is without a doubt worth every dollar spent, the quality couldn't be better. This 2 record set comes in the reproduced original gatefold sleeve with only a few slight graphical differences (e.g., track listings added on the back). The inner sleeves are paper with a plastic lining making the sleeves durable and tough to tear. The records themselves sound absolutely amazing with absolutely no audio defects to speak of. This set also comes with an MP3 download of the entire album plus one previously unreleased bonus track.<br /> If you are a fan of great vinyl records and love Tenacious D then you owe it to yourself to buy this album and help keep the vinyl industry thriving.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My highly diverse (racially, socio-economically) class struggled a bit with Harper Lee's diction early so this film provided an excellent complement to the novel. We'd read a few chapters, watch a few scenes. The film, of course, leaves out some parts and puts some things in different order but is otherwise a fairly strong adaption. Brilliant acting, of course. Film is black and white, which my students initially complained about but after five minutes of bemoaning, got over it. With all of the terrible re-makes that have been done over the years, I wonder why no one has ever re-told this story from a cinematic perspective. Great stories can still make great movies, even without sex and explosions.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|At first I was not sure about this show. But I watched it and I loved it. It's so good and keeps you at the edge of your seat.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book, as all Sparks' are great reading.  Twist and turns, love story not only with main characters but the others as well.  Even some paranormal stuff.  Want to see the movie.
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter was a great movie. It was filmed in my home town and I was excited to see some of the places that were so familar to me.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I was unsure if I should get this one since it was so cheap but my god I'm glad I did...<br />The things a beast! All the knobs were on tight and worked perfectly... perfect to have a silence band practice! The unit itself is sturdy and int made of cheap plastic, its METAL! Only thing I would say is a con is there's no power switch. So it either leave it plugged in or unplug it!
B003DS3GC0|5.0|This is a real movie of things that really happened most people don't want to recognize that this really happen to children but it does good movie with a lot of drama if you don't like to watch movies about reality don't watch this one but if you want to see something real watch this very good drama movie
B000FC1HBY|5.0|It's all about the people and the story those people are living. Mr. Martin has the reader living, laughing, loving, crying, killing, hating, fighting, suffering, and forgiving right along with every character. I found myself wanting to skip ahead to find out what would happen to a certain character first, but was always glad when I waited.<br />I HOPE THE STORY NEVER ENDS!
030758836X|5.0|This is one of those books that leaves you thinking.  How the author brilliantly unveils the truth behind a husbands and wife's less than perfect relationship.  It is not predictable by any means.  As I was reading the book I continually envisioned certain outcomes all of which turned out to be false.  The research and depth into a troubled, yet brilliant persons mind must have been deeply study and investigated while writing the book.  It starts off slow but half way through I couldn't put the book down.  I do not read books too often, but if I had to recommend one that would be worth investigating the time while keeping up with a busy day to day schedule this would be the one to lose sleep over.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I can't believe how old the movie is. Looks great on Blu-ray. Our son really enjoys one of many classics we watched as kids.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|please make a million more of these. id love to see an all underwater one with sea creatures  and crazy shells  and fish and shells...sharks!!!please make that as I have beaten this one. loved it. thank you.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The movie was a great movie but when i opened it, the code for download was expired. I had to email the tech support and get a new code, but they did respond so i give this 5 stars for a great movie and great tech support
B0042TV4IW|5.0|GREAT READ:  ENJOYING THIS VIDEO, FASCINATING SCENERY AND DIALOGUE!! I look at them to relax and unwind.I would recommend to anyone.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|The movie was the typical Micheal bay explosion film. Its good if that s what you look, and the shipping speed was fast and came earlier than expected even when we choose the free super saver shipping.<br />Also our copy had included a working download code.<br />Good shipping speed,<br />Working download code (through Itunes),<br />And A good deal (was 15 when we bought it) makes this a 5 star review
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Main reason i bought. It was raining and family and friends wanted to watch it. So when on amazon and bought. :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am in love with this game it is so addicting my little brother is 2 and says can I play Chu chus talking about subways.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie , very powerful performances. A++++ would recommend everyone watching it. very informative.you'll love it very much.
030746363X|5.0|This book is fascinating to say the least.<br /><br />I feel that this book goes beyond a nutrition, fitness, and female orgasms (did not realize that this was in the book, but am pleasantly surprised). Instead, I feel that it is a testament to what will power and determination can produce.<br /><br />This is my first Tim Ferris book. After reading this, I immediately purchased the 4 hour work week.<br /><br />This is a great book! I would highly recommend it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Old-fashioned story-telling combined with state-of-the-art methods, the best of both worlds. Whenever you aren't wowed by the action and stunning environments, you are taken in by the fun of the interaction of the group of dwarves with Gandalf and Bilbo with both their humor and emotionally satisfying insights. This draws you in almost like hanging out with old friends. And just like with the original LOTR trilogy, this is a good morality tale of why good should stand up against evil. This movie whets my appetite for the next two chapters.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I was watching a YouTube motivation video and Will Smith said that this was one of his favorite books. So I read it and it was easy and wonderful to read.I got lost in it,and felt hopeful while reading it.  I was actually sad that it was over when I finished.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I really enjoyed Angela's ashes. It was heart wrenching,sincere, happy, cynical all at once. A portrait of honesty, Mr McCourt does not gloss over the character's flaws and is painfully honest about his alcoholic neglectful father whom he loves when he is sober and obviously despises when he is drunk and falls to support his family.I enjoyed every last page though I wish there was an afterword relating Frank's future endeavors.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday to finish the collection I got him for Christmas...a great Amazon deal! The movie is really good. We saw it on our honeymoon and he has already watched it since I bought it for him. He's not one to re-watch movies much so that is saying something!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|It's official! It is definitely &#34;We're up all night to get lucky&#34; not &#34;the robot Mexican monkey.&#34; The song has definite groove is also official. I can't wait for the album. Excellent.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I would recommend Evernote to anyone with a Kindle, smart phone and  Laptop or other PC.  I couldn't find a program better suited to my needs.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I love this series - and was very upset when traveling and my android tablet broke.  When I replaced my tablet w/a newer version, I found It is not supported by Amazon Prime Instant video....so sad and upset, that I have to find a new place to find videos to stream.  I've loved Amazon until this....but now am very disappointed.
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|I love it.<br />Nocturne is my favorite from Chopin and I think Yundi is performance is the most beautiful of all.
B008WM4U7W|4.0|really liked this movie. Donnie is always good and I liked that Bruce Lee was only a very minor character
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|It was just horrible. There was no network by that name near me. At all. It was just really horrible. Don't get this app. It was just a sucky app.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie was chosen because I heard it mentioned in the Academy Awards and I was interested in the Director -- Quentin Tarantino.  I saw Tarantino in the movie Desperado and being interviewed on an evening talk show about this movie.  The movie was very interesting.  The characters generated interest in what they were doing although there was thoughtless brutality in the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows today. The psychology behind the characters is mind blowing. The zombies are cool too
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book 20 years ago, and it is still my favorite book.  The story is captivating and well written.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love the dimensional play this app offers.  Different ways to play.  Challenge yourself and have fun at the same time.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore has done it again.  He is afraid of no one and will go up against the powers that be.  Sicko is highly disturbing because, unfortunately, it is so factual.  The American healthcare system, such as it is, should be very ashamed.  Other countries have much better systems and genuinely care for their citizens.  What the heck is going on in this country.  The insurance companies and politians should be ashamed.  Sadly, money talks and that is all they hear.  Sicko should be shown in every classroom.  Kudos to Michael Moore.  I greatly admire him and ordered a second copy to share with friends.  They will be shocked and enlightened.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I like the different levels and the pretty pictures.  Puzzles are great and I have really enjoyed using this app at all times of the day.
B0000029GA|5.0|Best rap album ever. Every track is a classic. As with many rappers who ever dropped a monster 1st album, Nas had a hard time ever touching this again.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I used to play a similar game on Facebook but could not get to them on my phone or Kindle.  This solves my problem!  Lots of levels and fun to play,
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game was introduced to me and I instantly became addicted.  I'm not  a youngster but I can.t put this game down.
0307120007|1.0|This little book wasn't much more than a greeting card in terms of construction.  I sent it back before my baby could destroy it.
1469233959|3.0|I was disappointed to receive an abridged audiobook rather than the unabridged version described. I always prefer the entire book.<br /><br />That having been said, the quality is superb.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great Disney movie.  My daughter has watched it every day since we bought it.  Even my boys enjoy it.
B0050VJ29Y|3.0|I loved danger doom and broken bells, so I thought i would like this. I couldnt really get into it. I guess its not for me. But his collaborations are amazing.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Simple and compact device that does the job.<br /><br />I live in an apartment and have thin walls so this allows me to listen to movies at a good volume at night while in bed. My bedroom shares a common wall with a neighbor so I have to watch my noise levels.<br /><br />I use my FiiO E6 to boost the signal from my Roku 2 up to line level (note, the new Roku 3 has a built in headphone jack in their newly redesigned remote controllers- so this usage I'm describing is no longer necessary). This allows me to listen to movies at louder volumes without disrupting other people.<br /><br />It is nothing fancy and works easily straight out of the packaging. Plug it in with the USB cable to your computer to fully charge it and then use it to bring a signal up to line level.<br /><br />Sound quality is decent to my ears. Certain bassy sounds can get distorted at times. I have not messed with the settings at all so I don't know if this can be corrected or not. It was only a couple times so far so it doesn't seem like a big enough reason to tweak the stock settings.<br /><br />Charge lasts for several hours. I haven't actually had it die on me yet except for when I've fallen asleep and left it on. So I'm not sure how long it truly lasts. I've watch several hours of movies/tv on a single charge.<br /><br />I've read about one of the suppliers here selling cheap dangerous (potential fire hazard) knockoffs of this model. There is information around here and on the internet about what to look for. I believe that mine is real based upon the information on the web and I've had no problems with my unit.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|If you like the black keys you will like this CD. I got it for cheap which made it even better.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great and fun game to pass sometime.  You have to built your own village and solve quests in order to advance. Nice graphics and story.<br />I would have liked to give 5 stars but I just started to play and some of the quests require to ask to friends for material and I don't have any so it will be hard for me to pass those quests. I am not really a big fan of games that ask you for this but overall it's a cute game.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I bought this processor because it is what people suggested if you are not going to spend $500+ on an i-7. So far I am not disappointed. I wasnt originally planning on buying a different heat sink but I did. Apparently the one that comes with it is good but not if you want to overclock. I dont know if I will overclock. Seems simple enough but I am not sure it will be necessary for me to do so. I plan on gaming and running vmware player to do test servers. But that is about it. Good so far though. I mean it has only been in my computer for two weeks or so.
1476734941|5.0|I bought a copy of this book for a friend and one for me.  We started the Fast Diet on Monday.  I have dropped 6.4# and she has also been successful.  The book is simple to read and understand and the theory is valid in my opinion.  The authors have both been successful on the diet.  There are color photos of suggested meals and recipes to back them up.  There is a calorie counter chart for basic foods.  This is SO doable!  On the \\"fast\\" days, you eat 500 calories if you are female and 600 if male.  You can have caffeine and there are suggestions for healthy 500-600 calorie days.  You don't eat a bag of Cheetos and call it a day!  On the \\"feed\\"  days you eat whatever you like but you will probably find that you are not that hungry and do not OVER eat on those days.  At least I haven't.  You begin to realize when you are really hungry and when you can do with just a glass of water!  The case for fasting is explained in the book.  This diet has been highly successful in the UK and I have to say I am a fan so far.<br />You may be depriving yourself for a whole day but with the thought that tomorrow, you can have what you want.  I am of the opinion that most any diet works if you apply yourself to its principles but this one requires self control and discipline only two days a week!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|For the price, the 3D was not stunning.  I saw Avatar in the theater and the 3D was awsome.  This was just OK.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Seeing as I was convinced to watch this, I undoubtedly had an apprehensive mind-set. I went from &#34;Nope, I don't feel like watching anything associated with LOTR.&#34; to &#34;This movie is pretty good, are they making more?&#34; only to be fortunately rewarded with &#34;there should be more in the series coming soon..&#34; So that, my friends, is why there are only four stars, because I'll have to wait for the others. ;)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book and series is incredible. Very unique post apocalyptic story line with personable characters and a rich plot. Mr. Howey is pretty much awesome. I will be shocked if this isn't made into a movie and/or television series. I will be doubly shocked if anyone doesn't like the books. Buy, read, say woah that s@*t was crazy. You'll love it.
0553573403|5.0|Seriously good!! My only regret is that I didn't buy the four pack right away. I bought A Song of Ice and Fire and then fell in love only to realize I had to buy the other three all individually which costs more money. So, do yourself a favor and buy the four pack straight away, it's not like you're going to hate the book, you'll love it.
B005OP2928|5.0|Modern Family is just the best, hilarious! Can't wait for the next season :) Streaming through prime is great, good quality picture, no problems connecting, worth the money.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This series is absolutely masterfully created.  I recommend this product because it is in these episodes that the characters are 'defined'.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I think this will be ok in the long run but I got so frustrated with the controlls I have barred this to the bottom of the pile.  It works but needs a little something to bring it together.  If you have time play it you may like it just not my stile.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Love the game and it kills time...  great and imaginary play for those that want to experience something different from the original game.  Having FUN with this!
0316236535|5.0|After checking this book out from the library once, then spending 20 minutes trying to find it again when my daughter's begged for it, I decided it was time to buy it.  Both my girls love this book.  We just got it in the mail.  My two year old squealed like I'd given her a puppy.  I highly recommend this book.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Best series on TV !  Great acting, story lines, technical aspects are very good as well  Hope there are many more seasons to come..
B003G4W49C|4.0|Recommended from a fellow science fiction fan- great new take on the genre.  Orson Scott Card did a fantastic job of delving into the lives of children in an other worldly fight for humanity, I look forward to reading his other contributions.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Awesome wit the way they had set up one character to two and how time travelling is gonna affect us.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Orson Scott Card did a fantastic job with the follow up to the great Ender's Game. Thoroughly enjoyed following new stories. Great read.
0061743526|5.0|Will today's best sellers be remembered tomorrow? In many cases,the answer is no...the context has changed and the theme is no longer relevant.<br /><br />To Kill a Mocking Bird will be with us for a long time. First, it is incredibly well written...Harper Lee takes us inside the head of Sport and shows us the world of Depression-era rural Alabama through the eyes of six year girl. Lee knows this world and she takes you there like few people can. Scout is as &#34;spunky&#34;, tough, and courageous as any chapter you will find. Her father, Atticus, is as wise and patient as any character. They will stick with.<br /><br />Second, the story is important and will continue to be important. Sport's father, Atticus, is given the unenviable task of defending an innocent black from charges of raping a white girl. Atticus is a wise man who truly believes that all human beings are men (and women) and that they have unalienable rights. This book was not received in Alabama when it came out and played an important role in turning the mirror on the South.<br /><br />It was important then and it is still important today.
0307730697|5.0|I gave this book to my husband on the recommendation of a friend.  He couldn't put it down and he couldn't wait to tell me about it.  You will laugh and cry and be proud to be an American.
0307950689|2.0|A 600 page book that could have fitted well in 200 pages. Langdon, different from the previous books, is too narrow minded and figure almost nothing. Everybody explains stuff to him. If you are a fun of the series, read it. If this is your first Robert Langdon book, please pick another one.<br />Don`t know if I`m going to read Inferno.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|100% satisfied with the entire album. Fall Out Boy delivered. Now I want to get all their other albums to complete my collection.
0439796636|3.0|I loved the movie and I was anxious to read the book. So when the book arrived it wasn't as I expected, it was a juvenile/pre-teen book with large print and only 168 pages.  However, the book is in excellent condition, but I was disappointed that there wasn't more to the development of the story. There must be an adult version out there somewhere.
B004SEUJ82|3.0|We watched the movie because it had Asa Butterfield in it.  He his a talented young actor.  I agree the acting was good.  The father made you hate him for what he stood for.  I suppose as others have said that it is true to form for those times, but I didn't like the ending.  They shouldn't have killed Jews but mroe than that they definitely should not have killed children.  If it wasn't for the acting I would have wanted to give it \\"0\\" stars.  I would have been angry had I gone to the theater and paid $18 to see this movie.  We saw it on tv and unfortunately stayed to the end.  We rewatch movies over and over that we like such as \\"Hugo\\" also with Butterfield, but we will never watch this movie ever again and we won't recommend it to anyone.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|This worked just fine while I was doing &#34;other&#34; things, like chores, cleaning our email box, etc.<br />This worked just fine while I was doing &#34;other&#34; things, like chores, cleaning our email box, etc.<br />This worked just fine while I was doing &#34;other&#34; things, like chores, cleaning our email box, etc.<br />This worked just fine while I was doing &#34;other&#34; things, like chores, cleaning our email box, etc
B007H1HQW0|3.0|It will work, cut glass bottles. Directions were lacking, but I looked up how to cut glass bottles and found lots of help. Most were using this tool or something similar.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Classic Grisham<br />The underdog wins again in this triumphant novel about a single man fighting large corporations and greed. Bravo!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I love this whole franchise!  Matt Damon is a jewel in the lead.  He carries the movie well.  If you like James Bond, you will love Jason Bourne.  The action is well choreographed and non stop!  Delivered as promised, I would use this vendor again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it. The best part is when you collect coins and by New characters. Also I love how your company changes the police officer and my sisters think it is hilarious.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Matt Damon is a real find as the lead character.  The storyline takes you through a whirlwind of action and intrigue.  Anyone who loves a good spy drama packed with action will love &#34;The Bourne Supremacy&#34;!  Delivered as promised, I would use this vendor again.
B00BZXM3VA|5.0|This is a solid album that is enjoyable from start to finish. All the songs are amazing. Easily one of my favorite albums of the year so far.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I am not a schoolgirl, but this movie made me feel like one.  The storyline is a contemporary adaptation of a Shakespeare play.  The contemporary setting makes the story come to life for this generation.  The cast is well chosen and the storyline is believable from a high school students point of view.  Some of the storyline may not be suitable for younger audiences, but it made a big impression on me.  The vendor delivered as promised and I would use them again.
0765325950|5.0|Finally! We have waited long years and been saddened by the death of our beloved author, Robert Jordan, and at last have been rewarded with this wonderful ending of the Eye of the World series. I had to reread the first two books of this trilogy ending to remind myself of some details(and I think perhaps I need to go back further) which were cleared up, but I loved this book. I admit that I had gotten frustrated by the slowness of some of the last few, but I am glad I stuck with it. Really, I never would have not read them. It is very well written and seamlessly flows from Mr. Jordan's hand to Brandon Sanderson's. If the reader did not know that this book was written by a different author from notes, they wouldn't be able to tell from reading it. Truly well done. Now, of course, I want to know 'what happens now?'. Perhaps Mrs. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson will oblige and write one more book for us to glory in the defeat of The Dark One and find out more of what happens to the characters who have become our friends through the years.
0307891402|5.0|I enjoyed this product, it's very resourceful and is alnmost like a textbook for skyrim, if not better because of the ribbon bookmarks and the large included map.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great game, my 4 year old grandson love's it also, and so does grama, just a fun game to play.
B009M4KTEM|4.0|I liked this cd.  It was typical Garcia. I don't think the sound quality was all that great, contrary to what other reviews said.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is sooo great..........even my 4 year old grandson loves this game, love to play this game, sometimes just can't stop
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|or a lava lamp. I've never tried headphones but I imagine I might have had to give it 5 stars if I did.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun to play, takes no skills, just a mindless game, but fun for the kids to play and enjoy, fun
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Watched it for the 1st Time couple months ago.... its really good, funny, it has good actors love Winona Ryder one of Tim Burton's Best Movies
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is his best dvd if you are considering any of them- mostly because of the artist he is singing with. There is so much variety from michael buble' to lady gaga, this is a great dvd.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Back to roots...I hear some old sounds, DM as I used to know back from 80s.<br />You will fell in love.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best novels I have read in a long time. Could not put it down. Very surprised the author self published.
B003XU3MWM|4.0|Enjoyed it If you like good swords and arrows movies or good Roman military films, this is a good one. I don't know how historically accurate it is, but its not a documentary. Glad it was on Prime.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|This is one great movie a must see.john wayne.and James stewart best western and  lee Marvin plays a great bad man Looks like lee is makeing fun.
1878424319|5.0|This book is perfect for the co-dependent. Exactly what I needed to stop being so reactive and unhappy with the world.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|I was new to the doctor when I started watching season 1 of the reboot. And thus far have enjoyed all the doctors, and though Chris isn't my favorite he certainly did a respectable job.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Never watched this show but a friend recommended it saying it had interesting character development. After watching a current episode I decided to watch from the beginning and decided to order the first season. I am enjoying watching the first season of Elementary. The interaction between Holmes and Watson is very addicting.
B000FA675C|4.0|It was much better than I exspected.  It kept moving even though it bounced around 3 or 4 different characters.  The ending was a surprise and not at all what I was looking for though I didn't feel let down.  Thank goodness he kept the &#34;sex and love&#34; out of it and stuck to the story.  If I want sex and love I'll get a romance novella.  Well done Dan.
0374275637|5.0|I recommend this book.  It is an eye opening for all of us who think we are rational beings.  Raises serious questions about many economic models.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The screenplays are excellent, as is the acting and pretty much every other aspect of the show.  I was shocked when this show wasn't renewed after one season, since it is heads and shoulders above all other sci-fi series. Actually, it is probably above all other tv shows regardless of genre.<br /><br />It has very good stories, but what really drives the show is the characters, which are all excellently portrayed. Thankfully the creator, Joss Whedon, was able to finance a movie of the show called Serenity, which is also excellent. I would be happy if there were a few more movies, or at least a continuation of the tv show, even after all these years.<br /><br />Greg
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a part of my favorite series and that is why i chose a five star rating<br />Thank you

B005938780|5.0|This is the band at a high point of their career. Lots of memorable songs. A favorite CD of mine.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I am normally not a buyer of this type of music. I normally take a stance against this music. My stance is of the corrected kind. This guy is talent and a pleasure to listen too. The catch a grenade song is lame but the rest is excellent. Plus the ladies will drop their pantys to this....
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for a friend because I've seen the movie several times and really like it. I thought they would, too. Great cast! Quentin Tarantino is strange but gifted.
B001N18HP0|5.0|I am not old enough to know about the 60's and 70s evolution of vinyl. My teens was during the 90's and my love for vinyl grew. THis album is excellent. Beautiful remaster. Gatefold cover, is of taste. Fit Album for a fit Ear.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Interesting read another person's way of coping with a bad situation. Nice to read a book that doesn't go into every detail in the love scenes but leaves that to your imagination.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. Yes, it was packed with sex, LOTS of it, but there was also a very good story amidst all of the multiple orgasms. I also liked it much better than Fifty Shades....which, sadly, I didn't really care for and in fact, never even finished. As far as Bared to YOU goes... I really felt for the characters in this book and their horrific pasts and am intrigued as to find out what happens next in the series. Way to go Sylvia Day!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, well written and fun to read.  Keep the books coming, I'll be happy to buy them and share with friends.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I liked the signature song so decided to get the CD. I was not disappointed. There are many great songs.
034580404X|5.0|Wow what an attention grabbing book, once you start reading, its hard to put down, Can't wait till a movie is made!!!
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Of TNG movies, I think this is the best of the bunch.  They all have somewhat cheesy production values, but I think this movie has the best combination of action, morality, cerebralness (is that even a word?) of them all.  Loved the myth vs man angle, John Luc's moral struggles, Data's sparring with the Queen, questions of individuality.  Fun to watch.  I saw it when it first came out and this is the first chance I've had to see it again.  Very enjoyable.
B0053KWDES|5.0|My wife uses this with earbuds to watch TV when she is under the hair dryer. It amplifies the sounds without distortion. Being able to hear the TV makes the time go by quickly.
1451648537|5.0|My guess is that if you wanted to read this book you already have. It took awhile for this book to make it to the top of my list. I'm glad it did, not really glad I waited. If any of these words or topics interest you, you need to read this book...<br /><br />Handicapped parking, Mac, Gates, HP, Picky eater, iMac, iPhone, Funny, Bono, Microsoft, iPad, The Beatles, Techie, Dylan, iPod, Apple, Sad, Mistakes, and Assaholic you should read this book.
B008N1LL42|2.0|Well, I thought this would be kind of a good movie because I like the Navy. Wrong. Terrible acting. Terrible punch lines, terrible everything. The only cool thing was some of the explosions were cool. But it goes from a guy who is living on his brothers couch, to becoming an officer in the Navy, and a captain of a ship. And then at the end, he gets asked by a Navy SEAL if he thinks he has what it takes (to become a SEAL). Really? C'mon. Save your money.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I had to find out what happened next.  It ws a little hard to follow the intrigue but I had a feeling it was not like the first game.  Now I will have to get the final chapter.  The writing keeps me interested.
0525953728|5.0|I'm only a few pages into it, but I can tell it is going to be awesome. If you love special ops books, or just military in general, you'll love it!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|On the third level Lep keeps on falling off a cliff right from the start. By start i mean as soon as the level begins. I think it is a glitch but i don't know.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is just amazing.  I am slightly addicted to it. It allows users to &#34;pin&#34; items onto a virtual &#34;pinboard&#34; for others to see and share. Anything from travel destinations, wedding decoration ideas, tattoos, and favorite recipes can be &#34;pinned&#34;.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game! My only complaint is I wish it didn't take so long for things to hatch, build, or clear. It took 3 real days to build the roller coaster!
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|It was touted as hilarious. The moving was boring, not even chuckling moments, and disgusting humor!<br />The writer is clearly obsessed with men and women's private parts!
B005MLP71Y|4.0|It's simple: we need bees. Yet, bees are broadly feared, even by those without allergies. This movie is a delight to watch and my kids loved it- but it was also an important movie from which to learn.
1400082773|5.0|I like this because this is written by the President and like knowing who he was a person,..and information that I did not know about him,..very informative and wonderful reading,..would suggest this to anyone
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I loved this show, I was with it from the very beginning. I remember when channel 9 was going to cancel it after season 1 and the fans petitioned and the show stayed. During the midst of season 2 UPN 9 and WB 11 merged and created a network called CW. As much as I love Veronica Mars, season 3 pissed me off, especially the last few episodes. Season 3 started out good then it went downhill, thus causing the ratings to drop and the show getting canceled. I didn't see the entire season 3 when it was on the air because I was working nights, so I had to wait until I got the dvd's. Had I seen season three while it was on the air I  probably would not have gotten the dvd's because i would have lost interest in the show at that point because I think season three was awful.<br />I received all three seasons the year after it ended as gifts, I felt real bad for the person who brought me season 3 because I felt as if I wasted their money, but on the bright side I still watch all the veronica mars, even season 3. I just watch the episodes I like in the season three set. Overall Veronica Mars is an excellent series, with a whodunit twist.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|If you are going to purchase this series, it is worth the extra $ to purchase this set.  It comes with a Blu Ray, Dvd, Digital copy which you can redeem at amazon, which means that HBO gave you a movie credit for the HD digital series a $39 value, plus you can also redeem an ultra violet copy of the series which you can watch on any ultra violet streaming site.  Extremely good deal.  I also purchased this same package for series 2, and I will make sure to do the same thing for series 3 thru when it ends.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I saw this twice at the theatre.  I will enjoy looking at it again.  I rank it with Color Purple; both beautiful colors!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run rocks...the kindle version is way easier than the smartphone version but just as fun. gems are much more abundant in this version.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A very good movie.  I was not aware of it until mentioned at The Oscars!!  I recommended my daughter view it.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Been following JD for years. Great book just like his website and videos. I highly recommend this book. Good job.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I fell in love with this movie after it was recommended to me and the soundtrack had an awesome blend of techno and instrumental music.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is the best. The really long movie is good too. Read/watch it, YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Veronica Mars rocks!!!!! I didn't think season  three was going to be as good as 1 & 2, but it was just as good and worth the money
1250007305|5.0|Awesome book!!  Mr. Russinovich's knowledge of the incredibly complex and powerful technical world we live in is evident in Zero Day.  A must read for all, because the book so clearly explains what and how real \\"cyber threats\\" are.  Just the right combination of interesting human relationships and technical intrigue, make the book hard to put down!!  Great book to read for a book club because it promotes lively discussions.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a good read, something different but you can somewhat knew what will happen next it was a good read over all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I used a pattern lock on my smartphone when i downloaded this game onto it, and every time it kept screwing it up and i have to restart my phone when i get locked out. On my kindle however, it works like a charm! i highly recommend it, particularly to anyone who has ADD like me, it really helps you focus.
B000000OMP|5.0|This is my favorite Whitesnake album.  David Coverdale has a good voice and the band backs him up well.  A lot of the lyrics are pretty sleazy and it's &#34;hair metal&#34; but it's a little on the harder side rather than the &#34;poppy&#34; side.  Slow an' Easy and Love Ain't No Stranger are probably my favorites.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this show.  It can be a bit grisly at times but it's so well written and engaging. I just wish it didn't have so many disruptions to the televised schedule.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire quit charging with it's regular charger. When I talked to Kindle help they told me what I needed try first, which was get a particular charger and cable. Got both and my Kindle Fire started charging the moment I plugged it in.
B000WC3A0S|3.0|The disc for Rocky III was damaged. Unfortunately I had to buy it separately to have the complete collection. Hopefully I'm the minority here.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|My five year old son loves this cat, especially making him talk.  And, of course, what is funnier to a five year old boy than farts?  And yes, he made me laugh too.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My family and I LOVE this movie.  Lots of action and brings back memories for some of us when we were growing up and buying comic books.  Robert Downey, Jr., is perfect as Iron Man and really makes the movie.  Highly recommend it!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|AWESOME! WONDERFUL! FANTASTIC! What can I say! Best movie ever!!!<br />This was one of the best movies that has ever been. Everyone should see this movie!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It is well written for the most part I just started to scan whenever he began listing race car drivers...what they did.. driving techniques....otherwise entertaining
B00466HN6S|5.0|This was a very delightful and funny movie.  It was interesting to see the animals talk and act more alive.  You will not go wrong with this movie.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My entire family loves this movie.  With 3 kids, it is a rare thing to find something that entertains all of them, plus the adults.
B000F1IQNC|3.0|It was a very good movie.  But my copy would stop half way of the movie.  So I tried everything I know to fix it and it didn't work.  So I had to contact the seller.  But the seller was very nice about resolving this matter.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|First time i read this author And he is excellent. Book is gripping And full of action. A great read
1476712042|1.0|I know many people love this book, but I just can't. It's terrible, and the characters are terrible. Travis is possessive and violent in situations where he shouldn't be. How has he not gotten kicked out of school with all the beating up of random people in the school cafeteria and other places. In fight club, I get it. In regular situations, I don't. Also how has he not been arrested for the assaults in front of multiple witnesses. And Abby? I get it, she has a dark secret, but the big reveal was kinda dumb. America is a horrible best friend. Shepley is ridiculous too. The only sane character is Kara, and she's passed off as mean and irrelevant for her pointing out that Travis is horrible and co-dependent. Just not a good book.<br /><br />I cancelled my pre-order on Walking Disaster after reading this book. I didn't want to spend my money on something so dumb.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the most awesome game ever I love it can't believe how much fun it is although it is a challenge for me I love it
B005S9EKCW|5.0|After seeing the stage production many times and loving it each time I thought the movie brought a clarity to the story that couldn't be done on stage
0316069884|4.0|I first picked up this book for two reasons:<br />1. My favorite band Rise Against recommended it<br />2. I had to write a book report on a non-fiction book.<br /><br />Eating animals has definitely got me to look into more about where my food comes from and how to make better choices. I still eat meat and I'm sure most people who read this will still eat meat. Foer goes into depth about his own life experiences while delivering the facts and his opinions about factory farming in a somewhat humorous way. If anyone has watched Food Inc. I would recommend this to get an average person's perspective on eating animals. If you do end up reading and liking this book then watch Food Inc. if you haven't already to get a more visual aspect of what Foer describes in his book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The disc was a welcome remedy for the winter blues in Wisconsin. The cast is amazing and the songs are timeless.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|great interface for multiple accounts.  just don't install the update. it's a forced conversion to Outlook which is not a highly rated application.
B001JIA5TS|5.0|Robert Redford and Brad Pitt both give a great performance to a well written script. The ties that bring the characters together and helps in their later careers.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Great way to talk to friends and find new people and get to know and talk to them for fun.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|the game is fun with a decent storyline but you will lose a lot. u can breeze through the first few levels but then u will get to a point where u play with a deck that doesn't measure up to your opponents
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Cool game but cant log into glu network even though i have an account with other games be nice to earn points and get ranked
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Best alarm clock app that you can get for free<br />Would recommend this app to my family and friends<br />LOVE IT
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept me engaged throughout the whole book and was very well written.Can't wait to read the next book! Two thumbs up!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|To complicated lol. I would hope that they add a search bar some time soon because it's annoying! But i liked the words.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a riviting account of how this special team of highly trained soldiers methodically prepared for the take down of a visious killer.  I highly recommend this book to others.
B007REV4YI|5.0|After a couple of tepid films, the new James Bond has a chance to show his colors. The movie works well on many levels, and provides solid evidence that the Bond franchise is back on track.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|This is such an interesting film - you can read all about it in other reviews. What I have to say is this BluRay disc adds another level to viewing it at home -- excellent!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Read this book because it was chosen by a member of a book club I am in.  I think the authors experience was a powerful testament that there is a God. I would recommend it to anyone that has doubts.  This life is not the end of the road.
0307346617|3.0|I didn't know what to expect when I picked up WWZ. I was expecting the typical zombie book. At first, I wasn't intrigued at all by the journalistic approach - I found most of the stories very passive and I like the more active style of writing. I want to feel the emotion and tension. You don't get that with this book. But I kept reading. The stories are interesting in a way - it's a fresh approach to writing and I applaud Mr. Brooks for his ingenuity on that front. There were a few stories that really captured me - the female pilot that goes down in the swamp to name one. The pregnant Russian woman at the end.<br /><br />Even writing this I change my mind on different aspects of the book. I finished it - I've discussed it with friends - I'll probably go see the movie coming out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You have to get this game. The  best part is it`s FREE! There is awesome people like Talbot. There is an update every 24 days!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|One of the reasons that \\"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\\" and \\"Young Frankenstein\\" are perfect horror comedies is because they each have a consistent tone.  \\"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\\" plays as both a standard Abbott & Costello comedy and a standard Universal horror film.  Bud & Lou play for laughs and the monsters play it straight.  The only exception is when Frankenstein's Monster recoils in horror when seeing Costello for the first time.  \\"Young Frankenstein\\" examines all the clichés of old \\"Frankenstein\\" movies, but the characters are always deadly serious.<br /><br />On the other hand, I've been listening to a lot of old time radio comedy shows featuring horror stars like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre.  Some are really good (\\"Bob Hope\\", \\"Abbott & Costello\\"), but most of them (\\"Dinah Shore\\", \\"Command Performance\\") are painful, because they are written by hacks with no love for the genre, who trot out the same references and puns every time.  They'd be unbearable if it wasn't for the gravitas brought by the stars - Peter Lorre, in particular, could make any line funny.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" plays as if a team of writers from the \\"Dinah Shore Show\\" were assigned to write a straight horror movie and couldn't resist the impulse to Get a Few Boffos!  This could have been *such* a good movie, and it's just crap.  It just has no idea what kind of film it wants to be, and the mix it tries for just doesn't mix.  Barnabas Collins emerges from his coffin after 196 years and he's *really thirsty*, killing eleven construction workers luckless enough to have dug up his grave.  Then he does a lame gag with a McDonald's sign.  He brushes his teeth while looking into a mirror which doesn't reflect him.  He sleeps hanging upside down like a bat.<br /><br />There are some chilling moments, as when Barnabas sadly announces to a group of hippies with whom he has been pleasantly (if inanely) conversing, that he will now have to kill all of them.  Which he does.  Itwants to be a straight horror film.  It wants to be a fish-out-of-water comedy.  And it has NO clue how to put the two together.<br /><br />Burton also steals the brilliant sex-so-hot-it-trashes-the-bedroom scene from \\"The Tall Guy\\", where Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson hilariously wrecked an entire room without the benefit of harnesses and stunt people.  It's not funny here.<br /><br />Johnny Depp does what he can with the material.  For this picture, rather than channeling Michael Jackson, he's 100% doing Richard Burton as a vampire.<br /><br />Eva Green is really good as Angelique, though unlike Lara Parker, her eyes are not her most prominent features.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley is good as Willie Loomis, totally played for laughs rather than as John Karlen's angsty, guilt-ridden dweeb.<br /><br />I love Helena Bonham Carter in most things, and here she's a redhead, so you're not going to catch me saying she's being anything less than magnificent.<br /><br />Everbody else was ok.  Eh.<br /><br />Original series stars Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby appear in the ball sequence - for four seconds.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the original series.  I had high hopes because Tim Burton and Johnny Depp kept loudly proclaiming that THEY were fans of the original series.  As a straight vampire film with great characters and solid acting, this is a bust.  As an episode of \\"The Birds-Eye Open House with Dinah Shore\\", it's serviceable.  Not a bomb, but incredibly disappointing and not worth seeing.
1742200206|4.0|I like this guide a lot.  I think it has been well-designed from a usability perspective.<br /><br />Within the first 50 pages, there are topical listings of recommended attractions.  The next 200 pages focus on specific areas in Manhattan.  Brooklyn and Queens get 50 pages.  Within these pages, each section has a blurb, listing of sights, places to eat, and entertainment.  The maps in this section describe neighborhood walks.<br /><br />There is a separate 25-page section on accommodations --- which I think is much better than the Frommers placement within each neighborhood, because when you visit New York City, the public transportation system greatly expands your walking-distance radius.<br /><br />Then 30 pages on history, a 15-page handy reference list, and then 30 pages of maps.<br /><br />I want to highlight the maps.  In the Frommers guide, the maps are only helpful for answering: I know the name of something, now where is it?  The Lonely Planet maps have that, and the color coded numbered icons and topical grouping allow you also to answer: I am here, what's around me that's interesting (or where I can eat)?  And also, I want to eat/drink/sightsee (do a general activity instead of visit a specific landmark), where should I go?<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, some information is out of date or wrong.  For example, the taxi fare between Manhattan and JFK in both directions has been a flat rate for many years now.  In 2012, the rate was increased to $52 plus a $0.50 surcharge plus tolls (if you take any tunnels or the RFK bridge); but the book (published August 2012) still says $45.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|makes driving far more serious.  not as bad as the 300 soundtrack. word to your review.  buy it when you need such a thing.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This was one of those books that I happily stumbled upon and could not get enough of.  The story is based on the ongoing struggle between good and evil, but with a twist.  The characters are loads of fun, and the whole book is a huge pleasure to read. I'm very happy to recommend it!
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|My husband and I just wanted a lighthearted comedy. Instead we got crude, depressing and ridiculously unbelievable at times. No thanks!
B007QDNKQA|1.0|I like a good action movie, and a conspiracy / under-dog movie too, but the level of violent revenge at the end of this movie left me cold.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Wonderful film about two completely different people and the impact they have on each others lives. The progression of their friendship is funny and heartwarming. Makes you feel good about humanity.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a great book for parents to read.  It has a surprise ending that is totally unexpected.  It is interesting how the chain of events take place.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|well its a great game in general but the bridge is made of very few materials so the building process is slightly dull.

B006ZN7KMM|4.0|The articles show  different historical moments at the time they happened. The aspects covered are varied, the articles are long and exhaustive. Very interesting selection.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|parts of this move didn't make sence ..I liked the first one so much more I thought it was just ok
B004NELBPC|2.0|This was a useful and interesting app and I used it often.<br />Now, for some reason it's been changed so it's just a bunch of ridiculous pictures.<br /><br />Instead of an easy to read index, someone decided we needed one picture per page.  You can't usually even tell what the subject is.<br /><br />The app has been rendered into a slow, hard to use, marginally usefully picture album.  The photographers are probably happy but it has caused me to uninstall it.<br /><br />Oh well, it was good while it lasted.<br /><br />See ya.
0312944098|5.0|Once again Jeffrey Archer comes through with another great book. I always get excited when I see that he has written another book. A must read for Archer fans.!

B006VREHRS|2.0|The storyline and the caliber of actors has such potential - but both fall flat. Plot development is weak, the characters have very little depth and the overall acting is subpar.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read almost all of the Mitch Rapp series and could not put this one down.<br />The plot was outstanding and further developed the usual characters.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great Game!  Very addictive.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone.  I can't wait for Jewell Legends 2 to come out.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great way to kill time and look up fashion and party themes. Now my brain doesnt have to be clever. I can go on Pinterest and borrow an idea from someone else.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I downloaded this magazine because it said I got 30 days free but it let me read one brief summary and then wanted me to purchase subscription.  I spoke with someone else who had the same experience on the Kindle Fire.
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|I have never heard of them but this album has a few good songs...not a big of screaming nonsense with good riff music....\\"metalcore\\"
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Few flaws like  pressing  objects and it says it's incorrect. To many times, you lose time.  With a tablet for dark scenes,  have to touch to move light around and again is counted as a wrong spot.  Takes a bit for objects you find to make it's  way over and show more.  Costing more time.  Same in their other games  but still great fun.
B00AO7HN8Q|1.0|I'm from M&eacute;xico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection. I don't know why Iron Maiden decided to release their albums on picture disc since Brave New World they don't sound as good as normal black or colored vinyl. Too much surface noise and ticks and pops. Please, if someone involved in this is reading this review I beg you stop releasing Iron Maiden albums on picture disc and get better sound engineers to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|This deserves negative stars. About 33 trillion of them IMHO. Seriously. WTF? I admit I have not heard every piece of music ever made throughout history. But this has got to be by far the worst thing I have EVER heard. Trash cans falling down the stairs is downright soothing compared to this. How...did...this...get...made??? A 13 year old kid who got a \\"songwriting for dummies\\" book 5 minutes ago could write more coherent adn better sounding songs. Why...why oh why did Metallica feel the need to lend their name to this? I mourned when Load came out and they cut their hair. But I stuck by them. I defended them with the whole Napster thing. But this...this is just...beyond AWFUL. Do not buy this unless you love ear torture. :(

B002NN5F7A|2.0|The men in this video are frustrated with their inability to con people.  without scruples and integrity they plow ahead in the same old way expecting new results.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This CD is loaded with hits!  She sings about moments I can relate to.  My favorite is (What Doesn't Kill You) Stronger.  It's so true!  I like that there is a Christmas song included.  I'll Be Home For Christmas is one of my favorites and Kelly sings it well.
B002BEJ3BK|5.0|It dosn't matter which album, you can't beat the Roots on vinyl.  This is a fantastic album. Black Though is crazy under rated.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|The cast truly brought an impeccably written screenplay to life. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence give pitch perfect performances. During the movie you'll laugh hysterically and you'll truly feel something profound inside your heart. It's one of the few films of 2012 that is both funny and insightful.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|OK, I'm hooked on John Green. I'll admit it. This professed YA author had this NOT-YA reader from start to finish. The writing is fresh and authentic and the characters are real and current and I am endeared to them as each page is flipped. Get this book - read it then proceed on to read Green's Searching for Alaska. And I've just finished Will Grayson, Will Grayson.  Loved them both. Wow, bravo to someone who does so much more than tell a story but reveals characters and deep questions of life in a way that we relate to and fall for. I fell for the Abundance of Katherines and have fallen for John Green.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|I have been fascinated by Henry VIII since I saw &#34;Anne of a Thousand Days&#34; many years ago.<br />If you're interested in the subject matter, I think you will enjoy this book.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great characters! Story line plausible and easy to suspend your disbelief! I enjoy the interactions between the characters especially the Bishops.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The characters are always real and interesting; the plots and outcomes never disappoint.  Mr.Grisham is one of my favorite authors and keeps me entertained.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|My only complaint is that there are only six songs. Bring us more!  The bass and beat box are amazing, and the singing - beautiful, energetic, expressive. If I hadn't seen them live, I wouldn't believe all that sound could come from five humans. Perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I bought this game for my girls to play on my Kindle Fire HD. They love it. My oldest plays daily!

1401929281|5.0|For those of us in the esoteric healing industry there is nothing quite unknown here.  However, the honesty and sure-fired directness about this method gets to the point.  I believe there is no one on Earth who could not benefit from this expertise.  It is obviously very condensed, but I believe it to be quite possibly all you need.  This is a truly wonderful author with a wonderful healing system and all depends on you.  Do you trust in the Creator of All That Is?  Then do as she says, practice, practice, practice.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|What can I say..sets the standard for all thriller/suspense movies over the next decade. Watch it over and over. Classic
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Great movie for for the reality of the times. I will watch again, I will buy for my collection. THANKS
1402720602|5.0|Well written, well illustrated and spectacular photographs which accompany each step of a very complex and challenging art. A must have if you are considering trying your hand at building a guitar.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I loved the movie because it followed the books very well. Even though I read all of the books I still highly encourage others to watch it too.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I have always enjoyed reading Child's Reacher  novels.  This one is good with the exception that in several places Child gets too wordy.  I don't know if he planned it or not, but it gets boring for a while until the action picks up again.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|it is aviery, a tool so people can do art in your app, made into this 'art app'.  I don't see anything special.  Seemed to work alright. You'd have to be pro to make the pictures in the screen shot. seemed to work... nothing I need extra.  I'll stick to my adobe, but was faotd so thought I'd see.  seen worse free tools awhile back, but I hear this is free.
030746363X|4.0|5 weeks ago I had no idea who Tim Ferriss was. I saw him speak at SXSW, which was essentially a verbal tear through The Four Hour Chef. I was intrigued enough to buy all 3 of his books (I read 4HB first), and have been pretty much in the Tim Ferriss rabbit hole ever since. Fascinating and inspirational stuff. Frankly, it is worth the price of the books just for the sense of self-determination I feel as I read them - and that definitely applies to all 3 of his books..<br /><br />Despite the criticisms I see here on amazon, such as &#34;there's nothing new here&#34; or &#34;the science is weak&#34; I can only say, &#34;Who cares?&#34; and &#34;It's good enough to have worked for me&#34;.<br /><br />I've been following the fat loss program of this book for 4 weeks. Although I have a couple of challenges sticking with it 100%, and I'm still getting movement  in the right direction. My personal challenges sticking with the program are mostly schedule related. My not-at-all 4 hour work week and commute make it more or less impossible to stick with the meal schedule. But I stick to the dietary and supplement rules to the letter. The 7.6 lbs I've lost may not sound like much, but the fat loss I can literally see - and that my wife even noticed without prompting - is all the proof I need. Up until starting this approach, I was a Weight Watchers member, which plateaued for me about 8 months ago.<br /><br />Here's what I like most about the book:<br />- Tim's &#34;voice&#34; as an author. He's got a sense of humor. He doesn't have that superior tone that I can't stand from typical doctors and muscle heads. He seems to appreciate his success and his readers.<br /><br />- The content is explicit, actionable and surprisingly simple. You do have to read some parts a few times to pull out the details of his plan (which is why the rating is 4 stars, not 5), but they're all in there. By the time I read the fat loss section, and went back through it to clarify some things and build ashopping list, I was good to go.<br /><br />- Tim's recommendations didn't mess with my head. I didn't have to endure a days worth of humiliating self assessments to try it out. One book by another author made me videotape myself doing squats with a broomstick in my underwear.<br /><br />So, if you want my recommendation, read this book. Give whichever section applies to your aims a try. Then, read Four Hour Chef.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I would definitely recommend this CD. I am looking forward to the next full-CD release (it does seem to be overdue).
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Being 40 and married this was very entertaining. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for good comedy relief.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is definitely one of the best guitar players in the world. The new album has a great selection and you just want to crank the volume up when you listen to it.
0689835604|4.0|This book is super fun. Our 10-month-old LOVES it. It does kind of like a peek-a-boo flap with eyes, mouth, hands, feet, belly button, and maybe more (don't remember right now). Also, good for teaching your child how to be GENTLE since they can easily rip out one of the flaps. Still, I think it's worth it!
B0091TGWYE|4.0|I bought one of the light leather suede snug case for the iphone 5, I got it shortly after the phone was released last year.  I used it for the phone and my credit/debit card and driving license.  It was very handy.  My one criticism of the case is that the beautiful light color was gone in less than a month and the finishing around the top seams of the phone are now gone.  With time the leather has aged, I guess it is personal opinion as to whether you will like it or not.<br /><br />Overall it is a fairly high quality case, if I got a second one I would choose a different leather to this one (not suede) i.e. one that is more durable and would stand the test of time more resiliently than this one.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|We only started watching this show on TV the 3rd season, so I bought the 1st and 2nd season on DVD.  Always funny!
1470056496|5.0|Have many Jane Austen books...needed this for my collection..The book was a little big...but loved the read!  Was shipped and recieved in good time.
B0084670FU|3.0|I found is slow and till the end I still couldn't figure out how the Japansee girl fit in. Not bad but very different.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I admit I only read the book because of the HBO series. I would recommend reading the book first because often times I didn't like reading the chapter because I had already seen it play out in the series. The book differs in some aspects but for the large part the tv show plays out like the book.<br /><br />Honestly the tv series enhances on the book in some parts in my opinion.
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|Great performance by an artist who had enough confidence in her self to put her residence on the line to pay for the concert hall.<br />I always marvel at her ability to commit so many major works to memory and than execute them flawlessly without the need for sheet music
B0076DELIG|5.0|great read.  Not as in depth a story as say James Rollins but entertaining.  My book club read this and all enjoyed the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book and the writer's style. You hate Nick and love amy then you love Nick and hate amy! Loved the end. The plot was truly masterful!

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A chilling look into the personal life of one of the most notorious kidnappings in recent history. A fine example of how &#34;the system&#34; is indeed broken and grossly neglected and failed to protect an innocent victim from a predator who, let's face it, was not that bright. Which means that the judicial system, family courts and the local and state authorities were either just as dull as the kidnappers or worse, just uncaring.<br />Jaycee emerges as a strong woman, working through her stolen life. This gives hope to the strength and perseverance of the human spirit. Jaycee will never again be a victim. She gives hope to all.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app, really enjoy. Very clear and easy to use, no problems using it. Perfect basic calculator for easy banking needs.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|The Perplexus Epic broke within a two weeks of purchase.  The edge opened and the ball fell out.  Very poor quality.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book two is great - very readable and interesting to boot!  I definitely plan to read book three.  Hooray for an author who can blend fiction and history together<br />and make such a memorable read.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This calculator can do just about every mathematical function you'll need in a calculator. I was pleasantly surprised that it was able to replace my old business calculator and has the added bonus of being useful for home projects needing cubic or linear feet or converting recipes. There are several more features that scientists and advanced mathematics users will find extremely useful. The best part was the features are quite user friendly and whoever designed this set it up quite well by grouping the appropriate functions where they'll be most useful.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Too many questions left unanswered.  Complete situations were left hanging.  No real human reaction or feelings were revealed.  No links from one development to another.  No, I would not recommend this book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This series is fascinating in that it explores some very out-of-the-box concepts and shows people fighting to protect the world against singularly brilliant scientists who have an as-yet unrevealed agenda. I liked it because the relationships between the characters are not the typical formulaic relationships found in most serial TV productions. The actors give great portrayals of human beings up against frightening and never-before-encountered threats to security. If you have ever thought there is more to the world than what we are told or meets the eye then you may find this series intriguing.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This movie contains the most creative, intense and mind blowing fight scenes I've ever seen. Put it this way, at the end of the last fight, everyone in the theater stood up and clapped. However, don't go in expecting there to be a plot.  The dialogue and the character's action serve only to get them to the next fight, and that's makes this movie so great. Also, despite what some people on here think, this movie is not overly violent.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Lives up to what a Blu Ray update/upgrade should be.  Looks decent on a big screen that it wasn't designed for, with enough extras to allow one to explore something you think you know well in ways you couldn't imagine.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I had a friend who was always raving about how great he thinks The Black Keys are, so I bought this album on a whim. I instantly loved the whole album. It feels very cohesive without being too much of the same thing.
B000SRVQNA|5.0|SHADES OF DEEP PURPLE (T-102) was recorded in three consecutive May 1968 sessions following extensive band rehearsals. Solos were embellished in the studio; all tracks open with sound effects (on \\"Hush\\" for instance a dog howls).<br /><br />This classic album is a psychedelic and prog rock hybrid. Tetragrammaton pressings often have substantial white noise in-between songs. (NOTE: back cover liner notes misidentify Paul McCartney as lyricist on \\"Help.\\")<br /><br />In the U.S., \\"Hush\\" was the issued single. It peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot 100 and #2 in Canada. In the U.K., \\"Help\\" was chosen for first release. This 45 and the subsequent LP were ignored in Britain, while in America the album sold well and a tour that started in Oct.'68 did big box office.<br /><br />\\"And the Address\\" is the program's only non-vocal number. \\"Hush\\" reminds this reviewer of Status Quo, hitmakers with \\"Pictures of Matchstick Men.\\" Deep Purple's instrumental intro of an epic-length cover of Cream's \\"I'm So Glad\\" seems flavored with Vanilla Fudge. The quintet's dramatic interpretation of \\"Help\\" is again very similar to the Fudge. (Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord once admitted that Vanilla Fudge's Mark Stein was his inspiration.)<br /><br />\\"Mandrake Root\\" is named for a band that lead guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was in just prior to DP. Originally an instrumental jam, lyrics were added for Rod Evans. It retains an instrumental quality in a lengthy exchange between Jon's Hammond organ and drummer Ian Paice. After Lord's organ solo, Ian and bassist Nic Simper give the extended intro of \\"Hey Joe\\" a Bolero feel. Rod's vocal here is clearly a Hendrix homage.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[4:36] And The Address<br />[4:11] Hush<br />[3:15] One More Rainy Day<br />[2:45] (a) Prelude: Happiness<br />[4:53] (b) I'm So Glad<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[5:55] Mandrake Root<br />[5:45] Help<br />[3:34] Love Help Me<br />[7:38] Hey Joe<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 42:32
0385349947|5.0|I was so impressed with this book that I bought copies for my granddaughters, then I made the mistake of telling their father's about it, now they want the book.  Very insightful for women breaking the glass ceiling who make having a family and running a company work, not easy, but they do it.<br />Bravo S. Sandberg, you are an inspiration for my family.<br />Nanabee
B000002J09|5.0|Love all the songs contained in this album.<br />Brings back memories....<br />Jimmy Page is arguably one of the greatest<br />guitarists of modern music.
B000002HMH|5.0|Love it  my favorite of all their albums love old stuff is good but they just get kinda boring after hearing them so often by far james best vocals kirks solos arent about speed they are more mature solos they feel very powerful with feeling and thought then theres lars
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I especially like the first track, &#34;No More Walks In The Wood&#34;.<br />As a long-time Eagles fan, I enjoy the entire album.<br />However, the songs in general lack the super spark quality of<br />their greatest hits.<br />I would recommend the album.
0783225903|5.0|the thought and instances of irony in this movie are numerous. 1984 was a great book but a bad movie. the writter/director of this movie made a movie with the content of 1984 in a watchable and wonderful format. It was great.
B00006JKOM|5.0|One of the most creative group of musicians I have ever heard!<br />Love their music and would recommend it to people who enjoy<br />good popular music and to musicians as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great product I love playing the game! I love the keys and mystery boxes<br />Especially the jet packs
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I love every song on this album.  It explodes with excitement!  I'm glad I bought it!  I listen to it over and over again!
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|The movie was good and very entertaining (but never quite understood where the china doll came from or fit in since it's not in the original movie). The theatrical release was a decent prequel and normally I'd recommend<br />  ...... BUT........<br />If what I'm seeing listed as buying choices on Amazon to be a 3D Blu-ray version WITHOUT a 2D Blu-ray version  (never mind a DVD version) is just plain GREED from Disney - I would have liked both and probably would have only seen the 3D version once anyway.  My entire collection of Disney 3D is of the 2, 5 and 5 disc combo packs (many of movies I already had) but splitting the movies and not offering a 2D/@D combo pack now bothers me -- enough to put an end to buying Disney format after format (VHS, DVD. Anniversary Edition DVD, Blu-ray, 3D blu-ray). Heck my kids dont even watch most of them but tend to get them for \\"my\\" collection.  I think its now time to get off the Disney bus as the fare is too high for a ride I no longer need. Shame on you Disney for price gouging!
B0031KC8OW|5.0|I am always up for watching a t.v. series where the teenage girl is intelligent, empowered and very, very witty. This show has all that and more. I have now watched all three seasons and I have to say this first season is the best. Kristin Bell makes the show. She plays the daughter of a private investigator. She is also a perky outcast at her high school which is divided into the \\"have\\" and \\"have-nots\\". She is a \\"have-not\\" as far as money goes but she is definitely a \\"have\\" when it comes to smarts. She is her father's daughter and uses her keen investigative skills to help fellow classmates with their undercover needs.<br /><br />The great thing about this first season is that the writers have created this great plot arc that covers the whole season at the same time giving each episode a mini-plot. Not an easy feat. We have the giant mystery of who killed Veronica's BFF and then we have smaller mysteries throughout the episodes. Very clever. I also enjoyed watching all the 21st century surveillance equipment and computer technologies that Veronica uses in her undercover escapades. It is worth watching the series just to see who she outwits next.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|And I'm glad to say it didn't go south as I kept waiting for it to. Good until the very end...sad but uplifting.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|The series, with it constant jumping around, through various universes and timelines is great fun. That being said, I can see why it ended, as it would be difficult to follow on a weekly tv series basis, what with the constant shifts in locations, times and characters. I watched two and sometimes three episodes a day (the joy of Amazon Prime and Roku), much like reading a pageturner book you can't put down. I can't say I'm thrilled with paying for episodes in season five, but there are only 12 or so and I can get five of them free on Hulu Plus. Overall, I have enjoyed the entire series.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a very good read.  The focus is how the Seals prepare for missions and how they train.  The writer provides you with an in depth view on how they operate.<br /><br />The portion regarding the Bin Laden while detailed, was a small portion of the entire plot.  If you want to get a better understanding of the Navy Seals, read this.  If you are looking for &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; - like details on the mission, wait for that book to come out.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is VERy nice, clean and classic. Self explainatory, easy to fit kindle, and able to tilt it vertically or horizontally..Great price ,and it came quite fast.Definitely recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This WAS one of my favorite games.  Since March 1 I have tried to purchase credits about 5 times and never received what I ordered.  I have emailed them at least 5 times (probably more).  Either I get no answer at all or they send a generic  reply like \\"thank you for reporting bugs, we are aware of the problem and are working on it\\".  I am out about 30-50 bucks and no one will give me my money back or give me what I paid for.  Does anyone know who keeps them in check?  I would like to report this but have no idea if they even answer to anyone.  Buyer beware!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Johnny lee millers performance is fantastic. He should be winning major awards. The entire cast does a great job and the writing is top notch. Excellent, excellent series
B00BEU19ZU|3.0|I've only used it to track a friends flight. It was fun having an idea where the aircraft was from Florida to Charlotte to Syracuse. Amazing how many aircrafts were in the air during this flight.
B008CIUS72|1.0|Doesn't work. Do not buy this product, I believe your buying a picture and nothing else. I purchased this product to replace flash no luck!
B0064SHI9I|2.0|People should be aware that this app can only restore all data IF THE DEVICE IS ALREADY ROOTED. Apps can be restored on non-rooted phones but not any of the app's data. This is the same as installing each app fresh from the market. I see no point in buying this unless your phone is rooted. To date, the wording on their app page and on their web site must be read very carefully to see that root is needed for data restore. It is my opinion that the advertising is misleading, buyer beware. I bought this app to transfer my apps and data from my old rooted phone to a new non-rooted phone after reading the reviews. I was very disappointed to find that it transferred the apps but none of the data. I could have done that in several ways without MyBackup Pro. I have since been refunded.
B00170M2JY|4.0|Had to be trite with the title.... I love this movie for Cuba Gooding. So awesome! Tom is good too, and Renee is cute. But Cuba rocks that role. And Regina King doesn't get enough credit for her role either.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Dark. Compelling. Brilliant. A mesmerizing puzzle movie where the outcome is less important than the journey. Where the players are of greater import than the picture realized by their effort and sacrifice.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It has been a long time since I read book from cover to cover in a day. I loved this book and could not wait to read the second one.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|I grew up with ZZ Top... always loved their music.  Now I have a vast collection... what a great deal!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun and I can never put it down.Recommended to all ages if you can handle it!!
B000001EGA|5.0|LOVE this album.  I've owned it on vinyl (including 45's of singles and the album), 8 track, cassette, CD, and now digital.  It's a true classic... and for me, it never gets old.  Elton John is truly Captain Fantastic and I'm what you'd call a true fanatic!
B002U3CCBK|3.0|I bought this book because they a film out of it. In this case the movie was a rare example of being faithful to the book especially for three quarters of it. The film was a delightful light comedy and ended happily. I do recommend seeing the film. The book however started off with a liberal smattering of comical scenes but soon became serious until it ended sadly to my way of thinking. It is however a great insight on the workings of minds of political spin doctors and hide bound civil servants. In the end though the lives of all the characters touched by the plot are adversely impacted which left me unfulfilled as a reader. Having said that however I found the book to be well written easy to read. As I finished the book  disappointed I'm giving it just three stars.
B000001DQI|5.0|LOVE this album.  I first became an Elton John fan when it was released.  I've owned it on vinyl (including 45's of singles and the double album), 8 track, cassette, CD, and now digital.  I also have the DVD.  It's a true classic... and I'm what you'd call a true fanatic!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My lil girl really love the digging. I enjoy watching her play. It is a fun game,that's why I gave it 5 stars.<br /><br />.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Though this was very technical in a lot of areas, I didn't mind most of the time. It was interesting to hear about technologies and situations that are unknown to me.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars for just a couple reasons. First, the typographical errors became a bit annoying. Second, I wanted a little more focus on mission control and a little less of the astronaut himself. I don't want to give away anything, so I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend, especially for the price.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The kids (ages 9 and 11) have been engrossed in the whole series. This one was a great addition to the story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait until Season 3 was available free to Prime members, so I just had to purchase it.  It is a fabulous series that never drags.  Plus downloading the series on my iPad was a breeze.  I imagine I'll download and perhaps even purchase more movies and TV series from Amazon.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|This is little more than the same basic Princess Movie that Disney has been pushing out for years. If this was just a Disney film I would have given it 3 stars - basic, but not much else. For Pixar I expect something much better. Sure, not everything can be Wall-E or Up or Toy Story - but it was not even Cars. Little Personality and paint-by-the-numbers heartstrings.<br /><br />Pixar's first heroine deserved so much more.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The movie portrayed interesting real life situations for those of us in our 40's and provided a laugh or two throughout the movie; however, the 'F' bomb was the main vocabulary word for the actors which was totally inapproriate and unncecessary.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|It spends all its time looking at the scenery and doting on conversations that have nothing to do with and relationships  that are hardly, if ever made relevant to, the quest.<br /><br />Oh, yeah!... The quest! Did they ever arrive where they said they were headed? Who knows. It's difficult to tell they accomplished anything more than a temporary peace. Some would say that's the point. But even so, in my opinion, this movie has NO entertainment value.<br /><br />And the sequel-ized ending is SO gratuitous; New Line and MGM ought to be major-ly embarrassed, and WingNuts Films' production is exactly that.<br /><br />The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey is a loser and I'm disappointed that I spent even the $5 to see it.
1885167776|5.0|This book will stop you from asking over and over again why you are where you are. It will put you on track to where you want to be. It will show you how to define yourself and your life's purpose so you can move forward towards your ONE Thing, your purpose in life \\"making everything else easier or unnecessary to do\\". It's your life take charge of it.  Bart Peaslee
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I really don't understand why all the Academy hype. The story is interesting, in and of itself. But the movie telling is droll and uninspired; relying so much on tired old techniques for stretching time and heightening tension - &#34;Will they make it in time? OMG...!&#34; - that it gets in the way of some truly gut-wrenching choices and courageous acts that were made.<br /><br />And why people get nominated for being practically speechless and taciturn is beyond me.
B0086449YA|3.0|Knopfler's folk songs continue to impress, but compared to Get Lucky this effort leans more away from his wonderful and typicaly memorable guitar play.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Since i got my Samsung Galaxy 3 I use the Kindle for Android all the time - only have to carry 1 device. I rarely use the actual Kindle device any more.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I love it so much that I've watched it probably twenty times and I own the DVD but rented at a friends house just so we could watch it again. It so funny and I love fat any!!!!
0375842209|5.0|From the moment I picked it up, I was enchanted. The point of view is especially interesting, as the speaker is actually Death. But Death is not malicious; Death is simply doing his job, and he does occasionally become attached to the humans that he watches. The storyline weaves around a young girl and her relationships with words, books and people. I have read many historical fiction books about WWII, and this is one of my favorites. The writing is poetic and sharp. There are definitely sad moments, but overall, the story is beautiful, and you will be grateful that you picked up this volume.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Just want to say that this is a great addition to my growing collection. Tks for the fast svc. G.Goff
B004X4R3FE|4.0|After watching The King's Speech and a PBS special on Queen Mary, his mother, I have a new, more positive, perspective on the Royal Family.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|/Glad to have a full account to getting the SOB behind the /, attack. Glad that he is gone. Tks to seal team 6.G.Goff
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was exactly what movies like this inspire to be but never quite grasp enough details to really hit home. There are plot twists and character development of all three key actors and actress and there is quite a bit of background for many supporting actors and actresses to give a real dynamic approach to watching this film. You don't think of them as plot twists or climaxes to this movie because if you listen and pay attention the first few minutes you'll just get sucked into the movie and never worry about anything else. With a 90's setting it brings back memories of everything that people loved and cherished before the dawn of the Internet. If you loved records, cassettes and boom boxes you will enjoy these mementos thrown into the movie. It also shows how people used to interact in that generation very well. If you are debating on watching this movie it is well worth the $1.29 rental at Red Box. Get it and see for yourselves. As for me I immediately returned the rental and ordered a blu ray copy so I could watch it many times for many years.
B003LXSY60|4.0|I think I got the album first and then saw them in mesa, az. I love the music and this album is great, check out the preview clips for yourself and be the judge.
B000YKE87W|5.0|This is an older recording but it indicates how versatile and emerging his talent really is.  I felt this was a catch-up to what I'd already experienced by seeing him perform on TV, in videos and in later recordings.  What I can say is that the first time I heard Kaufmann it was on an Opera compilation disc and I was reading at the time but when he came on performing from La Boheme I sat up, put down the magazine and really listened.<br />I'm not a diehard opera fan but I was familiar with the aria he sang and felt it was the first time I'd heard the emotion of it.  The rest of this disc was a great discovery and it full of beautiful arias emotionally performed.  The fact he has a great range and dramatic renderings as well as romantic ones makes this a great one to own.
0062124293|4.0|every woman is a feminist...I scoffed at this when I heard her on npr. she's right though, I think it's an auto-opt-in at birth. everyone should read this, not just women.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|this game was easy to use and fun to play I will definitely buy the full version and I highly recommend this as a good pass time.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I like Bruce, so it was a interesting concept, good and action packed. a must see in the bruce collection of movies
B005DJREJS|5.0|I think this show is refreshing for young people. It's about life's journey and finding your way through the chaos to find peace. Very clever characters and love the Asian Mafia.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's nice to play when this game whenever you're bored. I also let my cousin play with it when I'm baby sitting her and it keeps her busy for a long time.
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting.  I held my interest from beginning to end.  I enjoying reading about his experiences while he was in heaven and how well he described the events.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love all of the series this book and cabin fever might be in a race for the best one that I like
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Purchased this for my Brother MFC-9970CDW which already had 256MB onboard ram.  I bought this in the hopes of speeding up high rez print jobs.  Easy to install and worked like a charm.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|\\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\" is a fantastic edition to the Die Hard franchise<br /><br />Unlike most people who write reviews, I don't quite them based on whether or not the film lived up to my personal expectations or whether or just on I had fun watching it. I review the film based on my experiences as a film student.<br />That been said I can now tell you as a fact that A Good Day to Die Hard is a good movie with plenty of thrills and twists the average movie watcher will not see coming.<br /><br />It opens up with John taking his vacation time to support his son who has (apparently) messed up his life once again, this time with the Russian government. Things go from serious to seriously weird when Jack and a political prisoner break jail after an organization try's to murder them both with a bomb. John trying to catch up to his son to convince him to turn himself in before things get worse winds up falling into his son's real life, a freakish event that drags the McLane boys into a none stop action packed mystery of follow and kill the bad guys which intern makes the two of them become closer together.<br />The story leaves no questions unanswered, the acting is fantastic, the stunts are mostly real (in the true spirit of Die Hard), there are no plot holes (everything has a clear explanation even for the imposable again in the true spirit of Die Hard), and the resolution makes you want more... perfect for an action film.<br /><br />My personal feelings about this film: Fun action romp but needed a bit more bonding between father and son and a bit less of the arguing scenes between father and son. The arguing got a little too repetitive and sometimes took away from the pacing of the film. Aside from that I personally give it 4 out of 5 stars.<br />The main reason I gave this page 5 stars is to kill all the bad reviews. This Die Hard is going into my collection the second it comes out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All I can say is that this game is... SO ADDICTING!!! Just got it today and couldn't get off it.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Better then Rise of Cobra and nonstop action!<br />This G.I. Joe is not the G.I. Joe you grew up with which makes it a fantastic action film!<br />It has just a few tinny flaws but it is worth every penny. BUY THE FILM!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I enjoy watching the character development as well as the intertwining of the characters versus storyline threads in each episode.
0802473156|5.0|This is a MUST read book.  You will have a life changing experience if you apply these principles with those that you care about.  You may for the first time in your life understand why there are 'gaps' in your experience of feeling loved in your life, even if you have received a lot from others, if it isn't the 'right' thing for you to receive, you will still feel empty.  Gary Chapman spells it all our very well!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I wish there were more like this.!  I search for all period/historic British dramas like this and watch them over again when I cannot find a new one.  This one was great....also of course, ...the pallisers, poldark, doc martin, duchess of duke street, wish me luck, etc. etc.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy this program.  Juliana Margulies is not only gorgeous, but perfect for this role.  Chris Noth as her husband, make you want to hate him and feel sorry for him at the same time.  I am only about halfway through the first season, but if the rest continues to be this enjoyable, I will certianly be watching the next season.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Be careful with this one!  I can't put it down!  I keep wanting to do one better than when I get the first passed level!
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|perfect thank you
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good game for the most part but some prizes take FOREVER to win. If they fix that it would get 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think Minectaft PE is the best game in the world! I'v already built a world with a house a garage a library and more!!! I really like this game and you should too.
159562015X|5.0|I took this test and read this book and I was so amazed with what I learned that I had to share it with loved ones. I learned a lot about myself and felt their testing methodology lead to spot-on results. My boyfriend found the same. It is not like your typical Myers Briggs or other test that put you in one of 4 categories- this method has multiple strengths plus different combinations that tell you about what you do well, and what you don't do well. I highly recommend it 100% for everyone.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Jennifer Lawerence made this movie with her exemplary acting and screen presence. The book had her in mind before the movie was a twinkle in the writer's eye. Buy the book, rent the movie!!
B001JIFYSA|2.0|Cheezy and frontal nudity in one of the first scenes. I ordered it to watch with my mom as it seemed to be a romantic comedy but it had a lot of crassness so I turned it off.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is certainly a movie you could watch over and over. The movie is very exciting and action filled. If you like trains, you'll like this movie. Each time I watch this movie I see things I didn't see the first time. I recieved this used DVD movie in very good condition and would not hesitate to order other used DVD movies from Amazon again.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|The game is very bland and boring.  Hey dev guys you got my money but you didn't give me a game.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Grinding gameplay, stupid combat system, glitchy and laggy,  you can only do 3 things,  mine build and fight,  no mods. Get the PC version just for the mods.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey had all of the elements of incredible drama along with humor and lessons to learn.  We looked forward to watching the series every night!  Love, lust, intrigue, mystery...............................and more!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. You are never sure who is the good guy and who is the turd. Oh by the way does Galinda own any other footwaear but one pair of boots?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We were so relieved when we knew that we could watch season 3!  Now we'll wait for Season 4!  Bring it on.  We miss the characters and their life stories................................
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Love this program. The characters are great, and who can not be entertained by guys who sail around and chop things up. The plot is fresh, believable and I can hardly wait until the next episode. These writers showed some skill here. Best of all you don't see Vikings tearing up after hacking someone to little pieces, or suffering from PTSD. Yes!
B00980IA3M|5.0|It's wonderful edition. All the Wagner's operas in on box and in the legendary interpretation. Ideally gift for my friends.
B009H5IS1W|1.0|Another stinky CSI show, except these formula characters fly around in a private jet. At time the story line is so dark they should be shot at night. Can you believe it, all crime can be solved with a computer, by some goofy gal. How did we ever solve a crime before Microsoft and desktop to PCs. Hold your nose.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|If your looking to get information, then its a good movie. Just was very drawn out, but I guess they wanted to be clear. It's an ok movie.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|An interesting take off of Arthur Conan Doyle detective. And who does not like Lucy Lu. Where are all these crime fighters in real life?
0785163174|5.0|My son loved this book! He thought the pictures, and story was great!  Beautiful illustrations, and very colorful.  He is hoping there will be another one soon.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|We have a goofy theme about a genius who can't get through school but is practicing law and all the co-conspirators helping him. All I can say is I like it, and I want a job like these guys.
B00866H7SS|3.0|If you liked Shades of Grey, you will like this.  If you didn't, you won't like this book either.  It does not really end, the book just leaves you hanging to make sure that you read the sequels.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Really!. A guy flits around town and shoots people with a bow and arrow, wears a hoodie and make up? This is entertaining and violent enough to keep me entertained. Frankly I would have shot more folks. I think the hero is softening up.Maybe we can have a reality spin off called the, The Green Cupid&#34; where a guy goes around shooting couples and we wait to see if the fall in love  while they heal?
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This is a book club choice, I would never have picked this book myself. I don't usually read fantasy and I am not a fan of magic shows, but this book drew me in with the author's mesmerizing descriptions. The only thing that kept me from giving it a better rating was the ending.  It was SO flat compared to the rest of the book, a great disappointment.  We sometimes have books that really get us talking about the endings, but there is nothing to talk about here.  It was just so blah, it almost didn't seem to be written by the same author.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|This program, like many other only works if it is not constantly interrupted by commercials. Easier to watch on Amazon. Interesting characters and fun some times.But seriously another CSI program? Do you ever wonder if there is anything else to write about but cop and cop spin offs? Don't waste you time, go watch Vikings or better yet buy a book and read it. Your kids will be dumbfounded seeing the Television off!
B007XF0X6G|4.0|Great collection of all formats DVD, Blue ray and 3D - included Ultra Violet copy as digital version<br />3D effects are awsome
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I have owned a few different versions of angry birds so I know a little about the game. I felt that for a free version this was a very good one but probably would have been dissapointed if i had spent money on it.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Good movie with great 3D effects - if it had full time 3D it would have been better - don't think of this being historically correct, because it is pure fantasy based on a couple of true events, the civil war and Lincoln was president
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a nice app. It is easy to use, and has the current weather to help you get dressed. I would recommend it.
B007PF7MGS|3.0|There seems to be nothing new in the diet world, just new titles. I have heard this theory since the 1960s and it does work, but nothing new.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover does it again with this book!!!! Wow! I'm totally in love with Will and Layken. What an amazing story. Colleen Hoover captures you from the first word on the page.
0307594009|4.0|\\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" was the diary of a young Jewish girl while she and her family were in hiding during the Holocaust. In her diary, Anne talks about the difficulties of remaining unseen: the lack of food, the inability to go outside or open a window, and the dull social standings. She also tells about how often her family and the Van Daans (the family hiding with the Franks), argue.<br />  When Anne's diary ends, there is a brief excerpt describing what happened later, summarizing the story along with the events of the war. The excerpt goes more in depth about the background of the Holocaust and the Jewish work camps, and also tells about what happened to the Franks and the Van Daans. I really liked the way the book was simply Anne's diary, changed only by translation to English or other languages. It was a really effective and interesting way to learn more about the Holocaust. However, I feel like the excerpt at the end was a little boring and fairly blunt, and didn't do the rest of the book much justice. I would recommend this book to basically anyone who wants to learn a bit more about the inside scoop of the Holocaust, as well as anyone who hasn't read it previously. I would definitely rate this book 4 out of 5 stars.
B000QFCD5O|4.0|I saw this concert  at another venue and wanted the various songs they did by their former bands. Its a great portion of the concert that they only did on this tour.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I enjoyed this film throughout.  The suspense, the mystery, the magic, and the science of magic are beautifully crafted into a moving story.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Well written, a page turner for me. Really enjoy historical fiction. Intriguing to have different perspectives from the characters on WW1.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome!!! The details...the conclusion that you didn't imagine. For me it started off slow but then it became hard for me to stop reading until I finished. I would love to see how this final movie turns out after Hollywood alters it
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Bring back the 80's!<br />This is a great collection of Depeche Mode's biggest hits.<br />Love it! - open the sunroof and pump up the volume!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This season started a little slow, but that was because we wanted to see Chuck use the Intersect 2.0.<br />This show continued to entertain us and make us laugh out loud.  The whole family enjoys it and it is a classic that tells a great story, builds on a great set of characters who grow from episode to episode and is a whole lot of fun.  The cast is fantastic and the direction is so amazing you often feel like you are watching a movie instead of a weekly series.  Way to go, Chuck crew!  Wish the show was still on television.  Don't miss the third season.
B00171R00O|5.0|We needed to motivate our son for FB/Hockey this movie did it, Now we just say you have to play like Rudy and he gets out there with a full heart!!!
B0084HJE0S|4.0|This is a very well written introduction to the subject with a good narrative on the history of JavaScript.  Just too short.  Wish there was more.
B008QI6EHQ|4.0|Good version I think. Hard to keep up with the translation at times and find myself looking up definitions of words. Which is good because I like to learn. Obviously I don't like who wrote the book, but I have a much better understanding on how he came to power. It is not as obvious and clear cut as many think in history. Germany was hit with hard times and being forced into tolerance of other cultures to the point to where the pride of the German people was forced to the back burner. In some ways we see this same stuff happening in the United States. The levels that this is happening can be debated. I am just saying that this book scares me at how well he was able to see actual problems Germany faced and relate to so many people at the time. While reading it though (having the gift of knowing what he does in the end) I can see the terrible person he was. If I did not know how things ended though I do not think I could pick out the dangerous and evil hearted person he was. Suggest you read it to understand a terrible part of history.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love his writing and am particularly fond of historical stuff so would and have recommended this to my book club.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 3 yo loves MLP, and this app is okay, but it seems not to run very well............lots of talking and not as much graphics.
B00181JGI2|2.0|I didn't care for this movie, the consistent cursing was very distracting for me.  Jeff Bridges is one of my favs, but this movie, in my opinion, was not one of his best movies.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I found everything about this order exemplary, from the quality of the video to the readiness to the content itself. Top notch all the way around.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is another good game to play while waiting in line, at the doctor's office, or where ever.  I play this frequently
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen dealing with the social impact of drug use on contemporary gay relationships. But, of course, it's much more than that. It's about love too. The film touches on just about every issue confronting highly privileged, young, relatively affluent gay men living and working in an urban environment. It's well filmed, well acted and the story was realistically told and engaging. Yes, there were some not-so subtle, one dimensional gay and extended gay family stereotypes in the mix, but overall the characters were mostly believable and authentic.The sound track was good too. Overall, I really liked this movie and might even watch it a second time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wasted my time reading, Gone Girl. It is hard to believe the book was a best seller. I kept thinking the book would get better.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Unlike the typical Hollywood submarine movie, this one shows what is a more realistic -- and hence more gripping -- study of men under severe stress.  No square-jawed John Wayne characters here, just ordinary but brave men caught up in a war machine.  It shows their ambivalence at sinking unarmed freighters as it conflicts with their natural patriotism.  The grime, claustrophobia, and boredom, suddenly punctuated with terror, indicates what life must have been like for these brave souls.<br /><br />The movie is in German, with subtitles, which are easy to read and do not detract from the experience since most conversation is terse and to the point.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Having served over 20 years and 3 combat tours, I can tell you Chris is the real deal.  As confident as you'd expect a SEAL to be, but humble and rich in character.  An excellent read!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The acting and directing is impeccable and gives you a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat all through to the end - despite the fact that you knew from the start exactly how it was going to end!  That's real story telling to me.  I enjoyed every bit of it!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|While I'm still a fan of the earlier seasons (seasons 3-5 were amazing) - season 8 is turning out to be quite interesting but would hate to see demons locked away for good - what kind of show would there be then?  Zombies or aliens? Great writing, acting and special effects - good looking leads (no surprise there - this is the CW) - interesting plot lines.  Bummed that Meg is gone though - she was terrific - her one liners were delivered with such grace, irony and vulnerability it was amazing!  Unicorns and puppy dogs for the she-demon...<br /><br />Anyway, big fan of the show and glad the CW has kept it for so long...the show and the actors have grown up...and I still hold to season 5's finale (Swan Song) as one of the best shows ever on television (even better than David Tenant's swan song in the new Dr. Who).<br /><br />My favorite line - &#34;Purgatory is Hell-adjacent...&#34;<br /><br />And one more thing - speaking of season 5 and the end of the world and all that -- I have traveled to Israel many times - still wonder why Kansas and the US and not Jerusalem and Meggido (the fields where Armageddon is supposed to take place)  is where angels and demons would fight.  Today, when you drive past the town of Meggido (it's a real town with real fields minus the bloody end-of-the-world battles) there is actually a McDonalds (a kosher one I think).  Just saying...I think that is where the big fights would take place (maybe one of the writers needs a trip to Jerusalem to learn some of that history).  Thanks for a great show!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was very good I really enjoyed this and would love for there to be more to come I love it
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Cant get this on the app store.  This is the one to get if you like to watch music videos and other good stuff on you tube.  Only bad thing is after awhile you have this urge to buy the mp3.  I think amazon is inserting subliminal messages BUY THIS NOW...
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Love Letter is fun quick game for two to four players where you try and get your love letters to the princess.  The game consists of several short rounds. The first player to win a set number of rounds, seven for two players, five for three players and four for four players, wins the affection of the princess and the game. The game comes with twenty cards, four of which are reference cards, thirteen tokens of affection and bag to store the game in.  The first thing you will want to do after opening the game is to sleeve the cards. We played one round of this game and headed to the game store for sleeves. The cards are thin and fragile and any damage to the cards will affect game play as a large part of the game is deducting what cards your opponent(s) have.<br /><br />You start each round with one card and each turn you draw a card and play a card. At no point in the game are you holding more than two cards. The affects of each card are written on the card making the rules easy to remember. The object is to knock out your opponents or have the highest total score at the end of the round.  I'm not going to go into the rules here as other reviews have covered them pretty well.<br /><br />The game is an elimination style game which I know many people don't like but if you are knocked out the down time is minimal so it isn't really an issue.  So far I have only played two player games and we have had a blast.  We usually pull it out every weekend and use it as a nice warm up game or as a quick one more game before we go to bed game. It's also a great game to keep people entertained while other games are being set up or if you only have fifteen minutes to play.  The rules are simple and can be taught in a matter of minutes and should be suitable for players of all ages.<br /><br />I would give the game play a five but I had to knock the game down a point due to the thin cards. I highly recommend Love Letter but urge you to buy sleeves.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie looks good.  It's got an interesting visual style, and the visual effects are quality.<br />On the downside<br />It drags quite a bit at the start.<br />My teen daughter loved the book, and really liked the movie, and yet admitted that she only really liked it because she knew and liked the characters, and knew more of the stories. She acknowledged that it wouldn't be a great movie for others.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great story telling, great productions values.  Love this show!  Met and exceeded my expectations.  Would recommend this to anyone that loves this genre.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'm so glad this experience was shared by someone who was a skeptic before.  The hypotheses and proofs at the end of the book are priceless!
B00A72989U|3.0|Excellant key board but its stuck in a single genrea and should explore others to open Alicia up to a more appreciative audiance rather then the pop R&B
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Had to read this before I could read the 2nd book and glad I did!  Intriguing and captivating.  Read it in 2 days!
0345505387|4.0|I enjoyed reading _The Exile,  though in a different format that I am used to.  I have all the regular books in this series and can hardly wait for the next one.This one was different but made an enjoyable read
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Takes a bit to get caught up on the political situation, but once that part is past it is a very entertaing show.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it help me to organize my finances. my recipes. my workout plan with pictures. and my personal reminders. love it. Excellent
B00003CXRM|5.0|this is one of my lifetime favorite movies, with humor, great music, fascinating characters, and a great re-creation of another time
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|This game has a lot of potential for fun.  But that is all it has, potential.  There are many, many bugs.  I'm not going to list them because then it would really have a negative value because I am a professional software tester and try not to give a lot of advice for free.  And believe me this product needs a lot of quality advice.<br /><br />I will give you one hint, though.  There are four islands on which to build bridges starting with &#34;Tutoria&#34; (I do like that name).  To get to the next island you have to score 30 points on Tutoria, but is seems only 29 points are possible.  There is no help, no suggestions, no instructions.  The information provided is erroneous.  (Oops, that is more quality advice.)  Very frustrating.<br /><br />If this is a lead in to purchase, for hard money, the full featured product, &#34;Bridge Constructor&#34;, here is my advice:  Don't buy it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Play this game you will love it! I can guarantee this will love y<br />ou right back. I also recommend. the other heroes of order and chaos.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My daughter plays it for hours. Good game for kids. Talks back just as thou they are talking. She loves the claws
B0025WX2YW|4.0|The more I watch the more I keep trying to remember my history lessons to try and remember what will be happening next.
B009S33I68|5.0|I was greatly surprised at how much I enjoyed this read. I'm more of a WWII and earlier type of guy but this is well worth the time and emotion. I don't give out 5 stars that often, but this one earned every one of them.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was a good book describing the days of slavery very well.<br />I would recommend it - though not the best book I ever read.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I lost my son's Part II, so this is my replacement gift upgraded to Blu-ray. I'm giving it to him tonight for his birthday. I'm happy.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Don't really know what can be said which already hasn't been. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. Like, right now.
0374214913|4.0|I enjoyed Sloan's writing; the characters, the visual descriptions, the small detailing that made it come alive for me in my mind's eye.<br /><br />Literature for the ages... maybe not, but I began it on a Thursday afternoon and finished it by midnight.<br /><br />To quote Sloan: \\"You will hold this book in your hands and learn all the things I learned, right along with me.... After that the book will fade, the way all books fade in your mind.\\"
B009AMANBA|2.0|I just didn't care for the way the story was handled, it was dry and boring with too much legal jargon, sort of like watching the nightly news. I expected it to be more about Lincoln the man, not the politician. Other than not liking the movie in general the price and delivery were good. Couldn't ask for better. Thanks.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Really great app 5 stars for me. And I guess they fixed the porn ads CAUSE I haven't see any so far.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|well researched, weapons and clothing match the time period. The people are believeable, and the story flows well.good job overall
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Second season of The Good Wife continues to provide excellent storyline and keeps me wanting to see more. Must watch
B0024RIMBG|5.0|What else can be added to beauty, grace, and talent. If you love beauty and beautiful music from the Irish and American POP abd Ballad genre', then you will love this DVD from Ireland.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|An unexpected turn of events becomes a frozen nightmare at 50 feet. They should have bought the lift ticket instead.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Logan is a civil servant and finds a beautiful girl to follow and help throughout the movie now if only he could get out of the baux
B000SGSU58|3.0|I usually cannot put Harry Bosch novels down but that was not the case with this one. There was a strong supplemental story line with Harry in court that seemed to take over the \\"Concrete Blonde\\" story line. This made the story fragmented instead of compelling. His \\"on again - off again\\" relationship seemed very tepid compared to prior books in the Harry Bosch series with little story support for the ambivilance. So - was it great? - no Was it \\"put downable?\\" - yes Would I put it in my books to lend and hand it to a friend? - yes!
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I watch this movie 10 years ago and hated it I watched a couple weeks ago<br />Definitely not too bad
1439181780|4.0|As a Professional Hypnotist (I am on leave right now for a special medical project so I know how these books and ideas can help:)<br />Some of the BEST Books on The &#34;Law of Attraction&#34; so far are:<br /><br />&#34;Ask And it is Given&#34; Abraham-Hicks (there other books are also great yet this is probably my favorite and most complete with &#34;processes&#34; you can use right now!)

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a simple story with deep spiritual truths.  I cared deeply about the characters and was moved to tears many times.  It made me appreciate my 15-year old dog in a completely new way.  Enzo was Buddha in a dog suit.
B004MPESSY|5.0|A prime example of the helpless getting some payback. When local rednecks feel they can take what they want.....they get what they give.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|they should see this movie.  Its dynamic showy and humble although the king or speech writer admired hitler I don't think he'd like his methods.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Keep up with Family where ever they are..post or just cruise your family and friends for latest news and pic.  I love it because I get to keep up with Family I might not otherwise say in touch with.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just can't get enough \\"Cut the Rope\\". I bought it last night and stayed up getting all my stars on all levels...Once they add more levels this will be as great as the first 2 \\"Cut the Rope\\" titles.
B00BJB2C8W|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Tyler, The Creator before this album and when I saw he was releasing a new album I figured I would give him a try. Honestly after listening to this album I realized that I had been missing out so I went back and listened to some of his older stuff. Even though his older stuff doesn't sound exactly like this album it just goes to show that you don't already have to be a Tyler fan to enjoy this album. Anyone who says this album is worse than 3 stars probably didn't listen to the whole album or didn't really look at the lyrics. They also probably have a problem with the artist himself if they think this is a bad album. Don't judge a cd by the cover, judge it by the songs. This album is great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMFG TOO SAD FOR WORDS VERY NICE BUT THE ENDING TOO CRAZY POOR GIRL I THINK HE WAS FALLING FOR HER
B0050PYNP8|5.0|What would you expect from the team that brought you Shawn of the Dead. A hilarious movie with a few nice twists.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Would recommend to all my friends!!!!  A fun read.  Sexy and romantic with fun all rolled up together.  Characters very realistic.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Cant get it to run on my HD Kindle Fire. : (  Have to wait till AMZ. Works it out with Adobe.
B00BHMF578|5.0|My wife and I rented this movie the other night because we had heard so many good things about the movie. We were not disappointed. This movie actually had us on the edge of our seats as it progressed. We found it both moving and exciting. I would recommend others see this movie as well.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|THE HOLY BIBLE SEEMS TO BE OKAY .  BUT I HAVE DIFFICULTY GOING TO DIFFERENT BOOKS OF THE BIBLE.  I HAVE NOT FOUND AN EASY WAY TO  DO THIS.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I really like this show. I have The Big Bang Theory Seasons 1-5 on DVD. I laugh really hard everytime I watch. I got into this series sometime after it started becoming popular. My mom and I are huge fans of this series.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Some dull spots at times.  Overall the book was interesting.<br />A little confusing at times when I thought the characters acted so differently than expected.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My grandchildren keep occupied with this cute game. I also enjoy this game.  It takes some  skill and strategy also..
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Just like the rest of the series, season 5 is light-hearted, comical, and continues to delve deeper into the character dynamics and their relationships. Only now, rather than fighting their feelings for each other (KB in particular) for four years, Castle & Beckett are finally a couple. The only thing that could make this season better for me is if they gave a little more insight into Castle & KB's relationship -- I want more!
B0000256HG|5.0|My husband lost is cd. Thanks for having this one. It played great. It got here fast too. packaged great too.
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|They got a few big stars and then left them stranded with the rest of the movie.  Can't believe I watched as much of it as I did.  I guess I kept hoping for a rebound but it never happened.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great game. Never played this style of game before. Thought I would never like a card game. This game is doing good on my kindle fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well written and acted. I enjoy every minute of it and can't wait for many more episodes! The costumes and scenery are first rate.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very good show - reminds me of &#34;Who Killed Rosie Larsen?&#34;  Very intense with many twists.  Not for the faint of heart
B001DUDKEY|4.0|The movie had many undercurrents of humor and you could not help but feel for the main characters surrounded by selfish self-absorbed people.
B0000A02U2|5.0|This movie makes me laugh every time. It came in great packageing. and it played great. thanks for a great movie.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I'll never listen to the original again. These remixed Lennon songs are so much better. Thank you very much Yoko!
B00633W614|2.0|This book was boring and too predictable. Not sure if I want to read the third installment. I can probably guess the outcome.
B000SL1Q2C|2.0|Did not know that this copy would not play in my DVD player, When I want to watch it I must use my computer. Love the movie hate how I have to view it.
1439199388|5.0|If you ever wonder why there has been so much more autoimmune disease, allergies, autism, MS, etc. in our modern life....this is a must read.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I found reading it was a bit tedious....Although the author did develop the characters well , there was not the drive to follow the story to it's conclusion.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just what I wanted.  Love the purple, the protection, the strap that keeps it secure and the overall thickness is great. Not too bulky.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I loveee this movie!  Would not have seen it/knew about it if not for a friend who's into puppets.<br /><br />Great stuff,<br /><br />Awesomeness!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|We really enjoyed this classic movie when it was first released. The 3-D version just doesn't deliver. We were expecting some eye-popping viewing, but it just didn't happen.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I pick this rating because it shows the meaning to every word all the scientist made up. That is why I pick my rating. But not every word means that definition
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I chose this rating because there was nothing to dislike. What I liked about it was it was funny. I would recommend this to everyone. I plan on reading the whole series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The &#34;read&#34; pulled you in begaining to end. Loved the characters ! Felt I knew them and rejoiced with them, whenever they enjoyed their small victories, and felt their pain when they were treated poorly.<br /><br />I feel  this should be required reading.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Movie was epic. Went far beyond what I expected I'm now hook on Evangelion. I recommend this movie to any and all fans.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|Bought this after seeing the boys on the Today show and hearing of their new tour. Though the boys were my daughter's faves, this 50 something mom loves them, too. I listen to the album while I walk and the songs energize me. Really enjoy it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really enjoyed the latest 007 movie. It delivered on the action and great story line. The Blu-ray is crystal clear, and a joy to view.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just got my Kindle Fire HD...had bought one for my daughter and I had to have one - Flow Free was the first download. Good way to exercise your brain in the waiting rooms of life. Easy to play, gorgeous color and nice sounds - not annoying at all.
B002MTTZ5I|4.0|i love this band it is super funny and i find them to be super interesting ... i would tell all about this cd
B000GWE44U|5.0|Okay, I KNOW some will say &#34;how could you love horror and have never seen &#34;The Shining?&#34; Well, it's true! as much as I love CLASSIC horror, as much as I love watching Jack Nicholson, as much as I love the works of Stanley Kubrick, and as much as I've read most of Stephen King's books (except The Shining) it was only recently that I sat down to watch it. For some reason whenever I see too many clips of films they seem to go to the end of the line when it comes to be watching them. So yes it wasn't until now (I'm 49) that I finally sat down and watched it. All I can say is WOW!  What an incredible performance by &#34;Jack&#34;! Shelley Duvall was great as that passive wife who would probably begin to grate on any husband over time and little Danny Lloyd was both adorable and SCARY! I was VERY pleasantly surprised to see Scatman Crothers as a pivotal character in this film! Overall, a great actors, great cinematography, great story and a GREAT film from Kubrick!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I am very pleased with the Calculator Pro.  I use it to balance MY checkbook among other. Tasks.  I really like this application.
B000B5MI3Q|2.0|I had high expectations for this watch.  I owned a Seiko watch years ago (one of the first automatic watches they produced) and was very happy with it (lost it later swinging on a rope over a river on a canoe trip).<br /><br />My disappointment is that the watch loses at least one minute a day during normal use.  For what I spent, and the autowind feature, I expected the watch to keep more accurate time than it does.<br /><br />If you don't have a need for an accurate timepiece, it's a great watch.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Funny, witty -- not too goofy and great fun!!<br />I am still laughing at this move.  I may have to watch it again. Enjoy :)
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|Although not familiar with Bon Jovi's music - that much - we attended a concert in March and I wanted to have this ready before I went.  Since then - have learned much about the band and the songs.  This is a fine CD..
B005JLN9Z8|4.0|super duper funny i liked the songs on here they are super cool and interesting i would recamend this to friends
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I thought this would be an entertaining mystery series, but there's even more to like.  The writing is sharp.  Fillion and Katic are great together, their characters nicely matched.<br /><br />The mysteries move quickly through an array of suspects and end up in classic style with the one you didn't notice.  There are also some long-term story lines that show up just now and then and especially at the end of a season.<br /><br />Start with Season 1 (10 episodes).  This is one series that got off to a fast start and didn't need a year to get up to speed. Also, there's some good background material in the extras in Season 1.<br /><br />Plenty of winks for Firefly/Serenity fans.
B008M0NDOK|2.0|The controller feels like a box in your hand. I really don't like it
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This compound works good.  I applied this on a Laptop that had issues with the heat-pipe that popped off the motherboard due to extreme heat melting the soldering of a standoff.  This compound takes some time to &#34;set&#34;, but when it does it appears to be providing the proper thermal transfer.
B00BU8RNCE|1.0|Sad, depressing and I wonder why I rented it.  Perhaps for the ending. If you like drama and tropical climates, not to mention $14 to spend. Have at it...
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater.  It was a great movie.  Glad I could get it for my dvd collection.
B00B4RP0OO|1.0|Not a very good app It would not play anything saved on my computer<br />I even tried to change the type of video and nothing worked good thing it was free.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I can't wait for the next two installments of this set of movies and then it will be Hobbit/LOTR movie festival all day long!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|One of the best movies of all time in my opinion.  You will not be disappointed!  Not suitable viewing for children, but OK for the older, seasoned movie watcher.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is Brubeck's signature, when you listen you're taken back to a time of &#34;BEATNIKS&#34;, coffee houses, jam sessions and so on. My collection is eclectic and so when you get  in the mood for &#34;some of that jazz man&#34; this might hit the spot.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I love it! It was a real tool for real Men. It holds my Flashlight even when I am running as fast as I could and it won't fall off. I also love the fact the it rotates nice feature guys. Thanks!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|...And it's awesome. This is music for those who miss the funky groove and soul of yesteryear. Don't expect epic drops or huge synths, just subtle and infectious funk with a modern touch of flair. Natural vocals unregulated with ridiculous amounts of autotune help add to the \\"human\\" nature of the recording. I guess really, they're finally becoming Human After All. ;) Daft Punk always does something new with each album they put out, and each time they can define a generation of musicians. I'm sure that, amidst those who \\"don't get it\\", this album is going to be a hallmark in electronic music history. Let's take music back to the glory days, guys. :)
B00AAQHP66|3.0|This is a true story so the ending is surprising as life often is. It is worth the time, especially if you are interested in surfing.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I already knew that I would like the movie after seeing it in the theater.  Before viewing the movie I had been dismayed that one book was going to be turned into three movies.  However, all of the extra, &#34;prequel&#34; type information found in other Tolkien books is a pleasing addition to the story.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|Game of Thrones has become one of my all time favorite productions. I would have rated this much higher if all of the discs actually worked. One disc locked up and refused to play. This is my second recent purchase (Boardwalk Empire, Season Two) with the same problem. I've started buying Blu-ray/DVD combos so that I can play the DVD and watch the problem area of the episode. This is not a problem with my Blu-ray player as it is constantly updated.
B0014BECF8|3.0|I bought this knowing of a few cut that I liked, there is more to this album than that. I think I'll grow to like it the more I listen, but the truth is I still choose &#34;Faith&#34; :)!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I love it. One of the best shows I have ever seen. I love every character and I'm going to cry when it's all over. I hope Vince Gilligan will create another show as great as Breaking Bad. If you haven't seen it, get the first season, watch the first 3 episodes and I promise you'll be hooked.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Take notes! Incredibly insightful and mind bending. Anita Moorjani who wrote Dying to be Me mentioned him so I had to read this too!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The story follows a group of retirees moving to India for a variety of reasons. Some of the best actors you will see in any movie. It will make you laugh and cry, what more can you ask for a movie.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|I got john blaze stuff.....I found the plot to be a bit contrived and the emotions seemed telegraphed at best.
B005LAJ1HW|3.0|Boardwalk Empire is a very well done and enjoyable production. I would have rated this much higher if all of the discs actually worked. One disc locked up and refused to play. This is my second recent purchase (Game of Thrones, Season Two) with the same problem. I've started buying Blu-ray/DVD combos so that I can play the DVD and watch the problem area of the episode. This is not a problem with my Blu-ray player as it is constantly updated.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I got the honor to see this show in Cincinnati, Ohio and it was fantastic.  If this release is half as good as that live effort was you are in for a treat.  The best part was the selection of songs.  It was a great mixture of old and new and something from every CD they have ever released.  Worth the money.
B005JR3Y5W|4.0|I still like it, but not as much as I used to. The plot lines are not as funny as they used to be :(<br /> Thankfully though, Schmidt still remains hilarious.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|After reading this book, I had to listen to all her interviews on youtube as well. One of the best books on spirituality I have read. You want to feel better about who you are and why you are here? Than read this.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Off the charts! Best TV in years! Can't wait for season 2....<br />Incredible acting and story line. Couldn't be better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a wonderful story!!!!!  To say this book is a great romance doesn't even begin to justify this amazing story. It sucks you in from the first page and keeps you reading.  The characters are interesting and you see their growth throughout the book.  I don't want to share the plot but it is definitely a \\"must read\\".
B000GOSVEW|5.0|This is a movie with an actual plot and a plan not obviously given away with the opening credits.  Even Travolta knowing the script follows through with some pretty good disinformation.  Of course, the weakest character is Hallie Berry, beautiful woman, absolutely horrible actress.  Even she receives a C for this film which is above average for her.  The rest is pretty darn good and her relatively minor role does not subtract from the twist and turns of this espionage triple agent vigilante extravaganza!
B007SLSUJW|5.0|a lovely journey weaved between the arts, the poignancy of facing the latter years and erotica. Some people criticize the misogynist viewpoint.  However, nothing prevents the reader from using critical thinking skills while consuming the words. the words are poetry as prose.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Enjoyed this book,  our civil war, part of our history , from young and interesting characters.  Theme not so different, but from intimate views of people involved and survived.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I discovered this series quite by accident by catching reruns on the Science Channel. Now I am hooked on it and have to see the rest!
B0040HERTY|5.0|This one doesn't disappoint.<br />Somehow that wry-rather-than-cynical (usually) smirk/smile doesn't become tedious just as the usual messy and raucous spectacle also rises, in its own ridiculously unbelievable and overdone fashion, above its own noise.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much because it followed the first &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; movie.  If I only saw &#34;Lord od the rings&#34; & &#34;Hobbit&#34; I would be very happy.
1401322786|4.0|This book was very different (in my opinion) than Mr. Albom's other works.  It is a fantastic story!  You never are quite sure what will happen next.  That is probably because his main character doesn't know what will happen!  As with all of his books, it is a great ride getting to the end!
145470246X|4.0|Gorgeous photos, good directions, but I think I probably need a basic class in beading before attempting any of these beauties.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Loved this movie! Great energy.  A little implausible at times but happy to overlook that because of the great energy and music and fun of the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the greatest Apple/android has ever had the price may look high but it is worth it try it for yourself !!!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Helen Hunt is - as usual - miraculous (if that comment isn't oxymoron).  All the acting captivates.  Despite the occasional clich&eacute; (surprising given the substance and insight of most of the dialogue!), the emotional honesty, unembarrased frankness, and nobility of character everywhere else on offer here are profoundly moving.  A very rich experience!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book was absolutely beautiful. Yes, it's very sad but it's done in a way that is touching and real.<br />Let me get something straight. I am NOT a cryer. I don't ever really get teary eyed. But in this book.... I'm not ashamed to say I cried. I COULDN'T HELP IT! But I think that really says something about the author. My emotions were all over the place! I was rooting so much for the main character! She was so awesome. Dark sense of humor, extremely talented and strong. It was impossible not to like her! We became besties immediately. She wasn't a cardboard cutout which was very refreshing. And she actually had a PERSONALITY and AMBITIONS! It was such a nice change in pace that itself made me want to cry in joy.<br />Although it was very sad there were a few parts I thought were funny. (It involves a celebrity and a band of hipsters. All I'm gonna say)<br />It was seriously an amazing book, writer, and experience. One of my new favorites for sure. Can't wait to pick up the sequel :)
1878424319|5.0|This is one of those books that you just must read.  Miguel Ruiz is a maser of presentation!  These four concepts will make your life a happier place!  I read it years ago & couldn't find my copy.  It was worth buying again to have in my library.  Excellect!!
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|EXCELLENT movie  I have been to one of there shows and there is nothing else like it to see, it's WONDERFUL
0739321005|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this book.  I've actually listened to it numerous times while driving. Keeps my attention even though I listen to it several times.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I have always been a huge Jurassic Park fan, so to finally get the Blu-Ray set below $50 was a steal! I didn't really need the Gift Set, but the cool case and the T-Rex statue was just an added bonus for the price. I wouldn't have spent anywhere near the asking price to get the gift set- I would have just bought the Blu-Ray movie.<br /><br />Any Jurassic Park enthusiast needs to get this.  The quality is amazing.  It is hard to believe this movie was made 20 years ago. I remember watching this on VHS!<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Extra features will keep any JP fan entertained for hours.<br /> - Blu-Ray quality = amazing. Wouldn't want it any other way.<br /> - 7.1 Surround Sound! Not many movies out there that utilize 7.1, so to be able to use all my speakers was a pleasant<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - The Digital Copy expired the end of 2012.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|The dialogue was real good and how it touched on slavery and the different types of personalities makes the movie intresting. The savage mentality brings the experience from the past more to life.
B004FS271I|4.0|This is a good collection of classic Satriani.  It exemplifies why he is considered among the top of guitar virtuosos.
140131046X|5.0|What a fantastic book.  Mitch Albom once again holds our hearts in his hands throughout the whole story.  I wish I could have met his rabbi friend.  He sounds like so much fun!  Mr. Albom tells the story with such grace and honesty - I was left crying at the end.  Not bad tears but happy tears.  He never says it but he shows us how important life is and how we should waste even a moment!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|can stop playing it play it all day can't get enuff of it help me it is one of the greatest game arpund
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I am a gamer, I'm not ashamed to admit it, and I enjoyed this movie so much. Its got a good storyline, actually made me tear a little (but i'm a girl so it might be because of that too lol), and I loved seeing classic gaming characters in the mix as well. My husband, who is not a gamer, also liked this movie, he laughed through a lot of it. Great movie for adults too!
B004NELBPC|4.0|I have read Huffpost for over a year now, and the app format was great.<br /><br />Well, now they have changed the format, and I am not a happy camper.  Difficult to figure out, very difficult to read with no way to amp up the font size, hard to keep going forward to a new section....Maybe it will be tweeked?  Not quite ready for primetime.<br /><br />Otherwise I enjoy the variety of topic sections, and the information is great -- especially like the Science section.  Glad I have it!<br /><br />Liz7bee
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Stunning visual effects. Great actors. Loved it!<br />Not sure they need 3 movies but I'm sure we'll enjoy them all.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Not very much action but a great study into how they found BinLaden.  It was incredibly interesting to see how he stayed hidden for so long.
1451695195|5.0|Being a nurse and working with neuro/neurosurgery patients I can tell you that this man should not be alive today.  This is not just one of those things people say.  If he weren't a physician himelf I doubt they would have let him remain in his coma as long as they did.  It is lucky for him and us that they did.  Dr. Alexander writes an amazing story.  He goes back in forth from what is happening in his hospital room to what is happening &#34;in his head&#34;.  I don't know that this will change the minds of people who don't believe in a heaven or a god but it is a remarkable story worth reading.  Dr. Alexander tells his story in such a way that you are up an down with him through the whole ride.  There are even a few twists and turns in there that you just don't see coming!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I don't play games very much but this is one that I play and enjoy so much that I find it almost impossible to stop playing.  I was playing one evening and before I knew it, I looked at the clock and it was 2 a.m.!  I am a mother and grandmother and I should have went on to bed, but I just had to play a little bit longer and then I looked at the clock again and it was after 3 a.m.  This game is easy to get hooked on, but once again, tons of fun!  Play it and enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book.  The story line kept you engaged throughout.  The writing made you really feel for the characters.  I would definitley read another Colleen Hoover book.
B008DKBPTO|4.0|I received my Kindle Paperwhite as a birthday gift and wanted to get a cover on it immediately.  I loved the color and design on this one as well as the price, so I bought it.  Its nice and sturdy, so I feel like my Kindle is protected, so I'm happy with the purchase for now, but I think I may spend the extra money later to get a cover that I can leave on while I read.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|i don't know why I watched the first after watching the second first few  - must have been really bored
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's really page tuner. I feel sad and sorry as characters of the book were killed. Finally I feel kind of cartarcis when I closed the book. I like this book recently giving me several emotions.
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|Tracklisting:<br /><br />1  In Your Eyes<br />2  We Like To Party<br />3  More Than Friends Featuring - Daddy Yankee<br />4  Fall In Love/Lie<br />5  Shining Star<br />6  Take Me Down To Mexico<br />7  Famous<br />8  Take It Off<br />9  Tonight<br />10  J'Adore<br />11  Caliente<br />12  Crazy Sexy Wild<br />13  INNdiA Featuring - Play & Win<br />14  Ok<br />15  Live Your Life<br />16  Party Never Ends<br /><br />Inna is back with an even stronger effort than her second album, [[ASIN:B005P5M45E I Am The Club Rocker]], as she goes back to her original club hit roots, and doesn't stray from that formula like she did on Club Rocker.  At first listen, the songs sound similar, but repeated play brings to the front how strong each individual track really is, and the fact you're getting 16 songs is incentive enough to track down this currently hard to find import only CD out of Romania.  I would imagine that once some of these hits get US club play, a US CD release should hopefully be on the horizon.<br /><br />Depending on which incarnation you have of her first album, HOT (mine had 10 different tracks), you're getting an even bigger selection of dance floor melodies combined with Inna's finely tuned pop vocals.  She keeps the Latin melodies from Club Rocker going on several songs (Caliente, Inndia, and More than Friends with Daddy Yankee) and even has a French track, J'Adore.  There's never a dull moment and none of the filler tracks I felt Club Rocker had.  Nearly every song has the ability to hit the top of the dance charts, with OK, In Your Eyes, Famous, Inndia, and Tonight being standouts.  I could almost name the entire tracklisting as standouts, as there's not a bad song on the entire album.<br /><br />With the amount of songs and potential hits on this album, it's probably her strongest yet.  Well worth it for the dance music and Inna fan.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a nice game to play but, the time you get to play is so short, perhaps adding a free play to the game would be even better, thanks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When you read the description of this book, you think that its going to be sad and depressing - which it is, but at the same time, it's so great.  I loved the characters and the relationships they had with eachother, and it made you really appreciate life.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie for both men & women! Some romance for the gals, some car chases and explosions for the guys, and lots of laughs for all!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book gave me the creeps and I found both lead characters to be awful and totally unsympathetic, but it was nevertheless an engaging and entertaining read. I recommend as a beach book.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|VERY ORDINARY. THE STORY WAS NOT GREAT. SOMEONE SPENT LITTLE EFFORT ON THE MOVIE. IT MIUST BE NICE TO BE A STAR AND MAKE LOTS OF MONEY FOR BAD WORK.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  You feel such empathy for this family. It also makes you wonder about the outcome.  A fathers love for his son and a mothers both come into question. Would recommend for anyone,
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Angry Birds Rio:  Boring and too many interruptions to play.  Have played Angry Birds on my son's device and this is not even close to as much fun.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book.  Interesting story line, loved the characters, great writing!  I cant wait to see the movie so I can compare - even though I know the book will be better :)
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Once you get the idea of how the game works, it is really addictive.  I'm always trying to better my score.  It does run the battery down on my phone quickly, though so keep the charger handy.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Several sequences that just seemed pointless to the story, but the film was entertaining. Christoph Waltz basically plays a 'good guy' version of this Character from Basterds, but that also made it LESS gripping. Worth a watch for Tarantino fans, but I'm glad we rented this instead of seeing it at the Cinema.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautiful book that I couldn't put down. Very well written. Humorous, witty, emotional. John Green is able to describe character's experience so that you fall in love with the characters.
B003S897U0|5.0|This has a little of everything.  It is an acoustic set.  I was expecting the original songs but I found I liked this far better.  I have played it so many times.<br />When I play the regular Crow cd's I always dig to find this one.<br />A must for Black Crow fans.<br />2 cd's.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong :  Completed the games and moved on.  Not enough possibilities for solving.  Like the challange of those presented.  Would purchase again.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Saw these guys on Letterman one night and ordered the cd instantly, not disappointed at all! These guys are HOT!!! The music is soulful, energetic and reminiscent of James Brown, Otis Redding, and Led Zeppelin all in one band! If you get the opportunity to see these guys LIVE, GO! They are so incredible \\"live\\" they are now opening for The WHO & The ROLLING STONES all this summer! And I don't mean somewhere down the roster, they are top billed! These guys could warm up a funeral convention! Ty Taylor has such a heart wrenching voice and a whirling dance phenom on stage-presence, VT is such a great act to see! Check them out on youtube too... Most people LOVE this cd, Nancy Lee is hot and one of my favorites is Jezzebella, can't get that song out of my head...it's permanently stuck in my cd player by choice! Love their mannerisms, they have a great facebook page for their fans and personally reply, and sign autographs for everyone at their performances. There's just something VERY MAGICAL about these guys, everyone says so!!!! Get this CD NOW!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Love it for my daily email needs and catching up with friends and family.  Also good to receive pictures of friends
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|Unless you have a degree in building bridges, don't exspect to be playing this app for long. I don't like it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire to help me get to sleep and stay asleep on the road.  It overcomes background sounds that wake me up and replaces with soothing sounds.  If the screen is off, it only takes about 20% of the battery for the whole night.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Having read all the books in this series I have to say that I think these folks are doing a great job of translating this storey to the 'Big Screen' so to speak.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|This album is definitely a different sound for The Strokes, but it's great! Although the album is mostly comprised of songs with Strokes' experimentation, there are still a couple of tracks that are obviously classic Strokes.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: Welcome to Japan and Happy Ending
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is very addictive! It is fun to play. Trying to get coins and stay ahead of the monster is challenging.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love the new wave of levels and the added Challenge of feeding to little monsters. Graphics are good, cute music that doesn't grate on the nerves, and an adorable character. Kudos to Zepto Lab for another great game.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Working as a Clinical Substance Abuse Counselor I highly recommended this film to my clients to see what addiction looks like at its worse. One of my clients who struggled in the beginning of his recovery watched this movie not wanting to admit to his problems with alcohol stating after watching this movie he was able to fully relate to this character and it started to allow him to see inside to his own problems with alcoholism. As usual there is no question that Denzel Washington is not a phenominal actor and played this part. He really captured the denial factors to addiction and for anyone who experienced some of the classic symptomology of addiction will definitely be able to relate to this film from the denial to enabling. This was a great film.
0307730697|5.0|I loved the book. I deeply admire Adam Brown and all the seals. I was also very impressed with Kelly Brown and her undying support for Adam.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much it keeps me going in those drowsy parts of the day.<br /><br />You should make another game for us
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|If your in the mood for a sensitivity movie this would be it.  If you just want to see Helen...meh...
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie Life of Pi is a beautiful movie.  It is good for the entire family.  I highly recommend it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Received the DVD before it was released here in Australia and have watched it twice. You actually get 2 dvds, and blue ray one and a normal one. Plus a link to store the movie in the Cloud, so now I can watch it anywhere. LOVE the movie and the music. Highly Recommended.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I liked it.  I would not have paid full ticket price to see it in a theater but it was cute.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I want more 3d to come alive. the monster. will be great if it comes alive.that is one of my wish from you guy
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I was looking for something to read on a business trip. This was a fast read and I have enjoyed his books in the past.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|The Music helped to make this production a real pleasure.  The story is tragic in several ways.  Good to see.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun<br />Too short.  Clever.  Love this genre of games.  Hope to find more like this. Will share with 12yr old daughter.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Have a hard time putting them down. Read them all. Can not wait for the movies to come out now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love these and can't wait for the season to start again,  I was glad I could see the seasons I had missed.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Very suspenseful... I couldn't put it down.  I thought for sure I was going to be able to guess the ending but that was NOT the case.  Seems that lately many novels don't give a concrete definitive ending... wish that wasn't the case.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very wordy and repetitive. I bought both books thinking there would be mostly recipes in the recipe book, but much of it is a recap of the book. I am not one to sit and read the same thing over and over again. So for me all that is needed is the cookbook as it has all the info as I need.
B000ITF86E|5.0|This is a good story and a great cast with lots of good family fun.  The way movies were made in the old days is what I love!!!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This album is amazing.  I highly recommend it! The first time you listen to it, album needs to listend to in order, not on shuffle.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Watched all the movies and read all the books. Movies were very true to the books. had to have them all
B005HEDIHG|5.0|This is the way this classic, groundbreaking show would have liiked had technology and production budget at the time allowed. Star Trek always looked good and this edition continues that tradition.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I LOVE this show.  If you like John Grisham, Baldacci, Sandford type books this show it perfect for you.  The twists and turns still surprise me.  It's a MUST watch and quite frankly Kevin Bacon does a fantastic job.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Great end to the trilogy. It reminds you why you relate to the characters and why you've fallen in love with them. Must read if you've started the series.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Just as good as the first season. HD is worth the buy compared to the first season I have that isn't in HD.
B004SEUIW4|4.0|This movie was really good and had an amazing soundtracks with awesome song  by all time greats like Replacements and Velvet Underground and take place in 1987 and an aumusement park  brings back a lot of good memories from 80's
B002BWP49C|5.0|Watched all the movies and read all the books. Movies were very true to the books. had to have them all
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I forgot how good this movie was! As a low level conspiracy theorist that happens to be a fan of most Mark Wahlberg movies, I found this to be well written and well acted...a mix of Gibson's Conspiracy Theory and Damon's Bourne series. Really good movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is soooooooooooooooo fun :D I totally recommend it even my dad loves it and he plays it on the planes he rides on the way to his bussiness trip. It is amazing!!!!!
B00BNWWUDY|3.0|I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it. However, I'd recommend this as a rental, not a purchase film. In every sense this was an enjoyable flick, but its flaws and plot holes will show with repeated viewings.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones gives the best performance in the film, followed closely by Jude Law. All the actors are competent and strong performers in their given roles. The first half of the film is very solid. In the second half the writing weakens and it all wraps up far too neatly. The film is most often described as \\"Hitchcock\\" like - and while it is obvious that that was the film's aim, it falls short of that monumental mark. It's better quality than most of what's being put out right now. It's engaging, entertaining, and it does not in any way insult the viewer's intelligence, but it never reaches the greatness of Hitchcock. Great movie for a rainy afternoon or a relaxing evening home that you won't regret watching, but it's not the kind of film you'll remember years from now.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I saw this movie totally on a whim.  I literally judged the movie by its cover.  After watching the movie, I felt a little confused and wanted to read the book.  I lost sleep over this book because I could barely put it down!  It was so good and David Mitchell is a literary genius who poses good questions concerning humanity.  I'm so sad that that special first read is over, but so glad I own it on my Kindle so I can read it again!  Buy it, clear out your schedule and enjoy!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|A great adaptation. It brings out the not quite arrogance of the character perfectly. The Watson as protege is a wonderful twist.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Well written and easy to follow. Kept my interest and it is a book I would read again. Good Book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I never thought anyone could be as good a Bond as Sean Connery but Daniel Craig really is terrific.  This movie is exciting and full of spectacular events.  Spoiler alert:  No one warned me about the sad ending so I ended up in tears.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Am unable to open the app on our Kindle Fire.  It consistently tries to open then fails.  Have troubleshooted a couple of times with Amazon support and still won't run.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I found no way to turn the volum down. It is either on or off so I shut it off, would have been nice to have some sound but when it was on everyone in the room was disturbed by the noise.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I haven't had a lot of time to play w/ this new app, but my grandchildren are sure to love it!  It is a wonderful way to break the monotony of desk work and give my mind a break from the numbers game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very well written and engrossing, for the most part, but it definitely needed a different and better ending.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|i would recomend this to anyone who likes marvel  cant wait for the sequal. Thor the dark world. a good tie in to the avengers too.
B004J00KJ8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It makes you laugh and makes you cry.  Hugh Grant is wonderful, as always, but the entire cast is also great.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Yes, this album is different than their previous albums, but that's typical of a great band evolving, right? If you can get past that it's not going to be the exact same Paramore, it is a fantastic album. Every song is different, well written, and well recorded. I love that they took some chances and experimented with different styles. Take some time to let it grow on you a little
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I only read this book because our book club requires you to read books selected by members.  Otherwise  we have to pay a fine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing :)<br />Endlessly entertaining with an ending to keep you hooked for reading the next book. I will  recommend to any teen or 20 something. Going to start reading the next one as soon as I get a chance.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Well thought out plot. Love the characters.<br />Good English, which is not always the case these days.<br />Can't wait for next in the series.
B004UPANGM|3.0|its a good movie to watch for sentimental value but other than that army of darkness and the originel are better
B002BWP49C|5.0|Cheaper than going to the store.  Stocking up on all the movies I love!  This being one of them!  Excellent 2 Disc Special Edition!
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Amazing Music; no two ways around it.  It is just one of the best movies of 2012 and one I had to own.
B009DH37CY|5.0|Perfect gift for my granddaughter.  My children and granddaughter know what great music is and they love it.  thank you
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Great Game for the whole family to enjoy.Fun for the kids as well as parents. Easy to play with great graphics.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|If you enjoyed the 2012 movie with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hatheway; This is for you!! Can't stop listening to this.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I teach the Bible and have really enjoyed the tools and maps and charts and very clear cut commentary. The kindle edition has enabled me to take this everywhere I want and still study on the go. This has enhanced my teaching and I'm thankful for it!
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|It was good to read this classic, but Tom's lack of caution is a very bad example for young people today. True, children don't understand all dangers, but Tom invites trouble and risk. I've noticed anyone lament that Tom and Becky very nearly died (it took them a week to recover) because of his wanderings. In the sequel, he got shot and might have been killed (he was delirious and took a long time to recover from that, too)- all for nothing except that he desired &#34;adventure&#34; and because he pig-headedly bosses people around, It's a shame. Tom Sawyer is not a role model, except for his exceptional knowledge of English literature in that hick town. It would have been nice to see him READING in the novel.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is a very interesting book! Very fast action and information about America that I did not know.  I look forward to reading more Sigma Force novels.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|My daughter has raided her dads albums and framed them.  They are around her wall/ceiling and this was an addition to add.  Goal is to complete the entire room
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This lets me organize my thoughts, and I have info for emergencies for family.  It's great for reminders.  Can't do without .
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I enjoy this app a lot. I can browse and bid on the go. I can watch items. This is definitely a keeper!
085786078X|5.0|Our youngest daughter love the videos on you tube and love this book. She always wants to see the &#34;key kat&#34;. Definitely want to get the rest of the series.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Start to finish this is an amazing record! One of their best! I haven't been able to listen to anything else. Well worth the purchase!
1400069289|5.0|Gives stories to illustrate how habits work.  Studies group dynamics and what needs to happen to move in another direction.  Wish I had this information years ago.  Would have been helpful in the work force, and in ministry.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Great show!!  Very dark... Can't wait for season II for prime members. Love being an Amazon Prime member!  Keep up the good work Amazon.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I loved this movie because even though society wrongly accused this man, he was able to overcome and after much suffering he showed them who was the clever one.  The support actor was awesome as well!
B000UPSKO8|5.0|I&#34;ve own this concert for a long time,but,introducing it to my VERY BEST FRIEND(43yrs)was a sure delight.Made him a very happy birthday boy.Now his wife is mad at me,for he can't stop watchig it!!!It's a fabulous concert!!!!!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I am a true SCI-FI fan and this movie is in my top 10.  The plot was well thought out. The chosen actors were really well suited for their characters. The special affects and c.g. were top notch. The sound quality was very good.  The story line did get a little fragmented at times, but that happens when you have to condense a 4 hour story down into about 2 hours.  Noomi Rapace was truly OUTSTANDING in her performance.  I hope this group gets back together for another movie.  I have only 2 slightly negative comments. The Alien creatures form and scope was so varied and inconsistent it was had to follow what came from what.  And, like one reviewer said the story left you with more questions than answers!!  This movie really should have been split into two seperate movies so that more time could have been spent developing it's individual characters.  GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!
B002XHNMVM|5.0|It's just one of those books your parents wish someone had given them when they were 20... Be yourself, do what you love and the rest will follow...
B000000XBC|3.0|Ordered product as &#34;New&#34;, but you never know what you might get until you open the envelope. &#34;New&#34; means the CD is wrapped in cellophane and otherwise untouched. This one had no cellophane, but the new sticker on the side of case was intact, and the case was cracked. They enclosed an extra case which did not fit properly, but the CD itself was in great shape...you buy unseen at a distance, and this is what happened this time to me...
B001GMQALY|5.0|I've seen this film a couple of times and I always come back to how well it's been casted. Without these personalities, this is just another semi-erotic movie....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay, this series is so intense! It's a mix of mystery, intensity, and it gives you the feeling that you're on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next. I couldn't put the book down! I finished the whole thing in one day. Definitely recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I flew through this book; it was a great story that kept me at the edge of my seat until the very end.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The quick ad before each new game is minor. The game itself has crisp graphics and smooth, fast tracking. No qwirks or glitches after 50+ games. Very nice app.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|&#34;Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?&#34;<br />Was there anything so great as Oscar Wilde's words?<br />Read and quote.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO READ IT.  wE HAVE HAD TOO MANY FUNERALS TO ATTEND TO GET IN TO THAT BOOK.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I could not be happier with the way my problem was handled.  The fact that you replaced the Kindle I had that did not work properly.  Your people are always so gracious and kind and helpful.  I liked my original Kindle and am very happy with the new one.  Thanks so much.
B00BESM14U|5.0|My new favorite film. It was so my high school life. My favorite line is \\" We accept the Love we think we deserve\\" so true. It's a tug at your heart tear jerker. It faces so many issues teens have and do deal with. It's written and performed beautifully. I laughed and cried. I think everyone should see this at least once. I'm gonna buy it  cause I want to see it again and again.<br /> The cast is steller. I loved Emma Watson, charlie's and Patrick's actors sorry I don't know their names off hand but I will. Paul Rudd, Dylan  McDermont and was surprised with Tom Servinni.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved this movie! Pretty historically correct. Had us holding our breaths even though we knew the outcome. We would definitely recommend this movie!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|This is the perfect case.  I received a Vera Bradley sleeve, but I was nervous about having my Kindle in there unprotected, but I also didn't want another bulky case.  This totally fit my need!
B009GJBEF6|2.0|Didnt really like this 007 movie. Wasnt no where near as good as some of the others I have watched.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I wasn't particular impressed with this movie despite all the hype. It's kids stuff. I guess I'm too old for this stuff.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I did enjoy the flowers and the meanings.  I thought it good a bit &#34;draggy&#34; by the end,  The characters were interesting
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|What I really like about this movie is that the message the need for clear communication. The absence of the mother did provoke an interesting conversation. I was a bit annoyed by the female portrayals at times, but not enough to spoil my overall enjoyment. My almost three grandson really loves it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This app is so addicting, can not keep my son off of it. I catch myself glued to it from time to time also. Worth the down load.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I'm a fan of metafiction, and Mr. Scalzi executed a playful and loving metafiction-slash-deconstruction of scifi TV tropes perfectly here,
B002LLDTA4|5.0|Here is Leonard Cohen with warts and all.  He plays to a mad, drunk, drugged, huge crowd at 4 o'clock in the morning and is utterly in control.The man is one of the greatest musical and poetic legends of the last 60 years so to see him there at this cazy Isle of Wight concert where there were upwards of 400,000 people is a real treat. What a treasure this is is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  I bought it to read for myself after seeing all the teens enjoying it.  I must admit, it kept my interest.  I recommend it.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Awesome but I need like races like a race were people race on your bridge so you see if it's good and ramps would be awesome too just saying
B008JFUO4U|4.0|What do you get when combine the themes from Kubrick, Spielberg, Scott and The Wachowskis sci-fi masterpieces along with some elements of Mass Effect and the mind of director Joseph Kosinski? You get Oblivion an unoriginal, but yet visually stunning and a fun and entertaining sci-fi film.<br /><br />The film was adapted from Kosinski's own graphic novel with the same name. It is 2077 the moon is destroyed and the Earth has been devastated by the event along with the war with the Scavs that took place sixty years ago. Humans won the war, but had to leave after it became an irradiated waste land. The remnants of the human race migrated to Titan a moon orbiting Saturn. Back on Earth a two person mop up crew of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) repair the drones that protect the machines that harvest Earths resources to take back to Titan. The couple lives a quiet life with just two weeks left to go on their mission. Victoria is content and can't wait to head to Titan. Jack on the other hand yearns for more in life. He has a longing to remain on Earth, and has even found a private Oasis where he has built a home along with that and his dreams of a seeing a beautiful woman on the Empire State Building compels him to explore Earth and collect artifacts and take risks, which get him into trouble and realizations about Earth, the Scavs and himself.<br /><br />Does the story take elements from other films like other critics have voice in their reviews? Yes without question Oblivion does. There are elements from films like Planet of the Apes, 2001 and The Matrix to name a few, but that shouldn't take away from someone's enjoyment of Oblivion. It is virtually impossible to come up with an originally idea with everything have been done before. It is up to the writers and directors to bring their own take on the themes and story along with trying to create a unique vision that will captivate, and bring wonder to the audience. Kosinski wasn't able to create something truly unique, but he was able to bring his vision to life. The story is pretty well done, and yes there are two predictable moments some audience members will be able to predict like who is the bad guy in the film. I was able to discern that pretty quickly, but there are a couple of twists I didn't see coming and certainly don't think most views will be able to predict. The romance and chemistry between Jack, Victoria and Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) is genuine and believable, and plays an important role in the film.<br /><br />Tom Cruise has garnered some criticism in his last handful of films for basically playing the same character and rightfully so. There isn't a whole lot of difference between characters Roy Miller, Ethan Hunt, Jack Reacher or even Stacee Jaxx. Tom Cruise has proven he's a very capable actor he just needs good director to push him out of his comfort zone like Michael Mann did in Collateral or Steven Spielberg did in Minority Report or Oliver Stone did in Born on the Fourth of July, and here in Oblivion he's given one of his best performances in years. Is it on par with some of his best? Absolutely not, but he does give a good performance showing what he is capable of and giving a wider range of performance besides his lad back happy go lucky smiley face performances he's given us in his last couple of roles. The two leading ladies also give good performances in their roles of Jack's loves. Andrea Riseborough is believable as Victoria and you can clearly see her love for Jack. All she wants to do his go to Titan with Jack, so when shows emotions like betrayal and regret it's all the more believable and meaningful. The beautiful Olga Kurylenko also does a good job as the mysterious Julia who Jack rescues. Just like Riseborough she does a nice job of conveying emotion. Morgan Freeman as Malcolm Beech is given a lot of screen time in the trailers, but in Oblivion he is just a supporting character. Beech isn't the best character for the likes of Freeman, but the actor does a decent job with the Beech and the character does play a pivotal role in the film.<br /><br />The action is sparse in Oblivion, but when it happens it is extremely well done whether it is an airborne chase through a storm and canon or a battle in a bunker the action is riveting, and the special effects are really well done. The detailed ruined Earth that was created is beautiful and richly detailed. That combined with the cinematography done by Claudio Miranda makes Oblivion one of the most gorgeous sci-fi films. Miranda is the same person who helped bring the world of Life of Pi to life. Just like in Tron Legacy where Kosinski brought Daft Punk in to give soul to the film he does the same here in Oblivion by bringing in M83 to do much of the films score with Joseph Trapanese. Together the two give sadness and soul when it is needed along with adrenalin boost where it is most needed. The two match the score to the scenes perfectly.<br /><br />I have never read Oblivion the comic, but from what I've read Kosinski had been trying to get this film done for years, until he basically gave up and made his story into a comic. Finally being allowed to bring his vision of a futuristic world to life director Joseph Kosinski does a pretty good job with his follow up to Tron Legacy. This is his baby he birthed and brought to life basically on his own. He had a clear vision of what he wanted to create and it generally worked. Kosinski is a talented director and I can't wait to see what is next for him which is hopefully the sequel to Tron Legacy.<br /><br />I understand the critics, but even with Oblivion being inspired by and taking elements from other sci-fi classics Oblivion along with writer and director Kosinski still managed to bring to life a stunning sci-fi vision with a pretty good story, good acting, great visuals and action, a great score and pretty good directing. I originally had high expectations for Oblivion, and while not living up to them Oblivion is still a good sci-fi film that I recommend to sci-fi fans and people who just want to have a good time.
B000FA675C|4.0|Being a Catholic that constantly questions certain truths i found this fascinating in that this author must have had the same doubts and what an alternative theory. Must have rocked every priest in the grave and drove some to it. I enjoyed this book but thought after initial plot it was a little predictable.

B00486070K|5.0|I bought this prior to going on vacation.  It worked fine.  It was a good price. I recommend it.  Thanks.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This album is just as Patrick (the singer) described it.  It is for summer nights with the windows down, volume up.  Great melodies, the tracks roll right into one another, with fun, surprising, guest singers like Elton John.  It is a bit of a different sound than their previous album which is part of this album's theme, of burning the old and raising the new &#34;like a Phoenix&#34; from the ashes.  I have always loved this band, starting with my love of 90s/early 2000s punk rock through their growth as a band (and I listen to pop and prog now, not just punk)  Music is about doing what you feel, not fitting into a genre or scene (Punk is Dead!) and the writing that goes into Fall Out Boy and the feeling that comes out just hits me in the right way.
B00656C6KK|4.0|Day still has not lost her magic touch.  It's a mix of old and new material--always more interesting.  It's Day-lightful!
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it is so wonderful and the acting is great.  I hope other people will order this movie I have told people about this and have other people watch with me.

B001UGB1X8|2.0|Great cast, good general idea, but just a mess. In other hands this might have been pretty great. Skip it.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Generally, I am a fan of Michael Connelly. His locations around Chatsworth provide interest for me as I live in Ventura County. His stories are gripping and attention holding, including The Black Ice.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I thought this would be a light and silly novel and I couldn't be further from the truth.  A novel of substance and a great story, interlaced with interesting history, I could not put it down.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo mail works just as well on my Kindle as it does on my PC. Initially, I was skeptical but I am now very pleased.
B00005R24K|3.0|One of Sam Raimi's early films. Part of a trilogy. If you're off to see the remake. Make sure you catch the original. Find it on Amazon and Ebay. Can be annoying with the screaming. Good action pieces. Plenty of special features. Also rent/buy Drag Me To Hell.
0765325950|2.0|Well, this is the finale.  And it is a massive book that answers a lot of questions.  As a result, you have to buy it.  After all, if you scraped enough money to buy the other 13 volumes, what is one more?<br /><br />However, this book jars.  If it wasn't evident before, this book fully reveals that Brandon Sanderson is not Robert Jordan reborn.  This book feels nothing like the legacy that Jordan left, and as a result, it is both irritating and disappointing.  Like another reviewer said - whilst Jordan develops his characters through dialogue, Sanderson does it via actions.  And some of what he does seems totally out of character<br /><br />*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />You have been warned...<br /><br />now the examples<br /><br />Take Rand's meeting with the seanchan.  Rand is supposed to be ta'veren.  So how does he bring them into the fold?  Does the pattern weave them in?  NO!  Rand argues like a lawyer and gets them via a technicality.  I would have preferred it if he confronted them on the throne, ta'veren forces Tuon to admit that they will follow, and then she keeps it because the Empress always keeps her word.<br /><br />Or the meeting with all the rulers.  I would have liked to have seen Egwene pulled along by ta'veren<br /><br />I thought that the Sharans did not need to be there.  But if they did, if Demandred was such a great general, he'd have the dreadlords travel to each city and destroy them.  Force the armies of light to chase after them.  Why attack them where they are strongest?<br /><br />The use of baelfire by the shadow was jarring as well.  Why use it now when they stopped prior to the breaking?<br /><br />The 'Chosen' all working together, and all having access to the true source is strange as well.  Why?  It is not like the Dark One should be desperate for a win.  The wheel turns.  Someone outside time and the pattern has the patience of eternity.  And speaking of the Chosen, why was Lanfear given such a free reign?  It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />I could go on and on about all the problems.  Like Alivia helping Rand to die, or the point for Gawyn and Galad both dueling Demandred (I don't even know why he would want a duel anyway.  All he cares about is beating Lews Therin - not beating every guy with a sword that challenges him).  The ease that Mordeth died, all those chapters devoted to \\"choice\\" (that really doesn't make sense - i thought they were a part of the pattern)...  sigh....  Anyway.... thus, I award this book a 2.  It doesn't deserve any more.  Robert Jordan has taken me on a journey, drawn me into his world but Sanderson has crushed it
B00571F26Y|3.0|Interesting read but a little over the top to comply with all of the recommendations.  If you are gluten sensitive, it contains some valuable information.  For others of us, it may be a little much

B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|It's a great app to pass time. Wish it had co op instead of head to head combat. Other than that it's a great game. Can't complain because it's free
B0019IB0II|5.0|An incredible insight into the silence of a stroke.  Very helpful and encouraging.  I have suffered an &#34;eye&#34; stroke as well as silent strokes and learned alot from Jill's experience.  I have had my husband read it.  It feels like we are prepared but hopefully never need the questions in the back of the book.  Excellent and important read.
B00005214X|5.0|For the George Harrison and The Beatles collector this is a \\"must have\\" recording from<br />history. Excellent Re-Master of a fantastic set of albums. Harrison at some of his best early solo work. Wonderful artwork with a boxed outer cover. Back-up band some of the legends. Just get it and enjoy - really ! (Shoot I have the album for those who remember what those are .)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My wife and I hadn’t seen the first and second season. It was fun watching writers develop the plots and relationship among the characters. The actors have also become much more comfortable with each other. There has been a trend away from criminal cases into more complicated civil cases. We really like all the twists, turns and surprises.
1616550414|3.0|I was really disappointed that they didn't have much concept art or details about the handheld series (I grew up on the handheld GB/GBA games) but it's alright overall. Lots of Skyward Sword stuff as a lot of people have probably already mentioned. The top right corner has a dent due to poor packaging but the pages are fine (though they have a strange odor to them). It's really fun to look at all the concept art nonetheless. It's okay, more of something I'd flip through when I get bored or want inspiration.
B00430EQK8|5.0|superb overview of an exciting Ring, in sharp Blueray
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|The music in this film is probably best described as being subtle.  There are few grand themes.  What did interest me was the sounds from multiple other sources.  When I first heard some of the electronic cues, I thought, dang that sounds like Tron (Another amazing soundtrack) [[ASIN:B004EI3ON4 Tron: Legacy (Amazon MP3 Exclusive Version) [+Digital Booklet]]].  On learning it was the same director things began to make sense.  Other musical references you might recognize in the background come from Dark Knight Rises by Hans Zimmer[[ASIN:B008MBXFEM The Dark Knight Rises: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Deluxe Edition)]], and Moon by Clint Mansell [[ASIN:B002FG9NLY Moon]].<br /><br />30 Seconds into \\"Jack's Dream\\" - Moon<br />\\"Waking Up\\" - Dark Knight Rises<br />2 Minutes into \\"Radiation Zone\\" - Dark Knight Rises<br />2 min 35 sec into \\"You Can't Save Her\\" - Very heavy hint of Dark Knight Rises.  The moment you hear the strings, you'll know.<br />2 min 30 sec into \\"I'm Sending You Away\\" - Hints of Tron<br /><br />I've only listened to this twice through, and probably missed many parts, but you get the drift.  There are also a lot of one time parallels, like a song that had the heavy, repetitive lower horn from Inception.  If you've seen Inception, it's highly improbable you've forgotten the sound of the horns lower horns blaring as the waves crash over them near the end.  Pretty distinctive sound.<br /><br />These are in no way a detraction from the sound of Oblivion, as all of those soundtracks are excellent.  It's just entertaining to hear a strand of music and go, \\"Ah ha, I know that sound!\\"<br /><br />The only thing I wish is that a proper theme had been developed.  Considering the overall quality of the music, a central \\"theme\\" could have been amazing.  But that's just my opinion, and in no way detracts from what's provided.<br /><br />Entirely unrelated to this review, but possibly helpful for those that are interested in similar music: If you like this soundtrack, you MIGHT appreciate [[ASIN:B007TG2ZHY Mass Effect 3]].  Or [[ASIN:B008TW0KXS Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut]].  No promises of course, but they have some beautiful, subtly futuristic themes primarily composed by the aforementioned Clint Mansell.  Enjoy!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love this series!! it puts a new perspective on vampire and human servants/ protectors.  Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down.  The end will knock your socks off!!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Story continues along with the fun.  I like the addition of new characters to the story line.  Sherlock even has a sort of love interest.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love the Sherlock Holmes series because the plot is never what I think it is and the solution only comes at the very end of the show. Both players are extremely good at their part, I love them both. 5 stars is not enough, the actors and the show deserve much better.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|My eyes can't move over the page fast enough! Love the Sean King character, where do I find a man like him! LOL

B007REV4T8|5.0|Because I love all James Bond movies and will continue seeing and purchasing any new films as they are being published.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching the shows.  This Sherlock reminds me of Gregory House.  He says whatever he wants and many times gets away with it.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Moving, true story; wonderfully photographed. Can't understand it's relatively unknown status. The supporting cast of characters are outstanding including Hal Holbrook.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|This little mic has been put to work since i got it. It is now a mainstay in my camera bag. Thanks Rode!
B00BF8OYJO|3.0|As you read the first premise in this one, you know how it will end. Not as engaging as the real thing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing book loved it! Some spelling errors but overall a great book. I would recommend this book. Finished it in one day.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Over the top  and then some ... House Kicks butt n takes names. How a character instills such a dichotomy of emotions still gets to me. Nothing yet to replace the series :-( Namaste'
B008XX6J4C|5.0|So awesome that I bought more for presents and my friends bought several CD's.  I want a DVD and I can't wait for Piano Guys  2.
B0000024LN|5.0|If you are here, you shouldn't even need to read reviews. Classic Hip-Hop right outta Jersey. If you are here, buy it. it's that simple.<br /><br />you're welcome
B009X01FJS|5.0|Love the color.  Love the price. Especially love the work it revolves for easier use and it's stand up capabilities.
B008EKON56|4.0|Works fine. Because of the rectangular shape the connector has to be very carefully positioned if the iPad is in a case with a small cutout. It should be noted that this is a line out device that disables the iPad's volume control, so any adjustment of volume has to be made on whatever device the iPad is connected to.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Do you like the Strokes? I really do, so it was an easy choice for a purchase decision.<br /><br />Comedown Machine has a lot of 80's sounds, specifically new wave types of sounds.  I wasn't a huge fan of the first single 'All The Time' and was a little worried, but the first time I put the album on in my car I had a big smile on my face.  That song was probably chosen as a single because it is in line with their defined sound along with 50/50.  That's cool, but I think the songs where they go a bit more off the beaten path are far more interesting.  Another thing that stands out is these songs seem to have a bit more fun energy in them than what the past couple albums had.  Let's hope that's the case because I think it would be sad for rock/pop music if they stop making records after this.<br /><br />I graduated from college the year Is This It came out and I played that CD to death.  Every time they put out a new album its always compared to their first one which seems unfair to me.  Moving through life your tastes change.  The clearest way I can review this record is that 34 year old me likes this album as much as 22 year old me liked their first one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Loved every minute of it.  Saw the stage show, and the movie made everything fit together.  The music was fantastic
0394826817|4.0|My 4 year old loves this book.  She's always saying, &#34;Lowly says please and thank you&#34; or &#34;Lowly helps clean up after dinner&#34;.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|what can you say about Pink Floyd!  Simply the greatest music of the 20th century!  Great sound quality CD.  David Guilmour at his twilight but rocks! and very good lyrics
B0012CH350|1.0|I purchased this same cover in 2009 from Amazon and the quality was great, very thick material almost like the ones used in Jeep's soft tops.<br /><br />Four years later I am living in another state so I purchased the same grill that I had and the same cover, to my surprise the quality of the cover it's not the same, it's like cheap plastic, what's going with Weber !!! they used to sell this great cover and now they're selling a cheap piece of black plastic as the same cover and at the same price.<br /><br />I love Weber products but I feel cheated, I'm totally returning this cover.
B00B7FWWNA|1.0|All I can say is I didn't finish this movie...very disappointed!!!!  Too much nudity and subject matter that I'm not sure why anyone would be interested in watching!  I usually like Helen Hunt (which is why I picked this movie), but I was disappointed in her and this movie.
B00A2BTCXI|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars except that I compared it to the Dark Side of the Moon (DSOTM) SACD. Since this album was mixed into 5 channel audio with Dark Side of the Moon in mind I was led to do a quality comparison and 2112 does not come even close to the audio quality of DSOTM SACD. BUT,,, I suspect it is a difference of the source master tape. With that said I think the 5 channel mix was excellent. The video with this blu-ray was like a comic book where the words are the lyrics. It helped me understand a part of the story that I've never realized.<br /><br />The real beauty of this release is that it IS Blu-ray Audio. Unlike SACD or DVD-Audio where you needed a special player to play those formats, this format allows the consumer to have high bit, high sampled music with the use of their blu-ray player. Keep in mind that you must use a receiver that can decode the DTS Master Audio format and use an HDMI connection. I hope more artists jump on this band wagon and do the same. I don't understand why they wouldn't, it gives them a chance to sell their material again. If you're new to blu-ray audio don't be satisfied with lossy MP3's give this high quality audio your ears.
0375413405|4.0|I had given my wife volume 2 of this book, but it kept referring her to instructions in volume 1.  Now she had both volumes.  Most of the recipes has gone over well with the family.
B001041JLE|5.0|Great sound quality coming from the remasted tapes.  Vingtage Michael Jackson at his best of times.  Dynasty of the 80's and 90's era!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I´ve been reading the books and watched the seasons at the same time, and i like the fidelity in which the script for TV is constructed. All the chapters and stories with The Imp are very enjoyable, specially this season and in the clash of kings book, where we see Tyrion as a political mastermind in all his greatness. Dinklage, two thumbs up!. And add some direwolves action, and you´re all set. Excellent blu-ray edition.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I watched this with my 13 year old grandson and we really enjoyed this movie.  I love it when they make these children movies so well that everyone can enjoy them!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this story of her journey so interesting, I didn't want to put it down it.  She knew she was missing something in her life, had the courage to go out and try to find out what it was.... I loved it! Very inspiring. Still one of my best overall reads of late.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book provided a unique and unadorned recount of one SEAL's life. It not only recounted the war stories which most would expect from a book like this, it also spoke to the issues that resulted from putting the job of being a SEAL before all else (to include family). It was also interesting that there were several instances where Chris' wife gave her perspective on the events as they unfolded. As the review title suggests, this was a very interesting read. It was a real page turner. I'd recommend this to anyone trying to get a better idea as to what life could be like as a SEAL. Mr Kyle was a true hero and patriot who dedicated his life to serving his country on and in his latter years, off the battlefield. This book gave a little glimpse into that life.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really enjoyed the read. Never say, \\"now what can happen\\". You don't want to know.  I had to get out my calculator for some of the math and physics.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very cool game it is kinda like temple run but no turns lots of cool characters also
B0027ZCQ4E|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie...Matt Damon is excellent as Jason Bourne.  Watched it with my teenage grandchildren and they like it, as well.  It was nice to be able to watch a movie that wasn't G rated that didn't have extreme bad language or sex in it!
B00C6TUXN2|5.0|I love Willie and his family, I wish there had been as much family as on Heroes, but still love it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Just the fact that I can't wait for the newest season says it all.  From plot to characters to special effects,  this one's a winner.  And best of all?  For the most part,  it's older kid family friendly.
B008P86FTE|5.0|I haven't heard someone sing so deep with metaphors like this in a while. Great song writer.<br />It did take me a little to really get into but nice I did I couldn't stop listening to it.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|If you're a true Bowie fan, you'll want to spring for the extra tracks - even if they are short ones.  To me, track 17 is one of the best on the record.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Fun challenging and yet simple enough to get started right away only a few levels in but learning.  Would love to have more options for the base and maby some tunnels.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|if more people could think like sweet Enzo, this world would be a better place.  I want to read it AGAIN!
B0026PA05M|5.0|This is great hard rock music. Lzzy Hale has an incredible voice.  She can really scream when the song calls for it, but also carries a melody. I can't recommend this album highly enough.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It has been a few months since I was actually able to open this app. I might delete. I don't want to lose my families.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had no problems with this app. I travel alot and this has been very useful. Very accurate and easy to use.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm not too far into this book yet, but so far so good.  I look forward to turning the page.
B0091XT22O|5.0|I have loved this, movie since it was first released. I saw it in the theater three times. I owned it on beta, VHS, Laser Disc DVD, and Blue-ray. I chose to get this.on HD digital so. I can watch my favorite film, anywhere It is perfect viewing on KIndle HD. Great viewing.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Another great hard Rock & Roll album from the Hales!  Lzzy Hale has a great range to her voice.  She can belt it out when the songs call for it or deliver a smooth melody.  I can't say enough good things about this band.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was riveting and very authentic to the time that it was written.<br />All of the characters came alive and were believable

1609611543|3.0|I was interested in the idea and found the contents informative and useful; I'm about 3 weeks into being wheat-free and enjoying it.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy was the fluff. Every sentence containing a fact was often accompanied with 5+ anecdotal sentences and statements that really didn't serve any purpose but to turn a pamphelt into a sell-able novel. I have an ebook version of this book as well as \\"Summary: Wheat Belly ...in 30 Minutes\\" available in iTunes. I got an equal amount of useful information but this book is over three times as long as the summary version.<br /><br />I can't find the ebook version on amazon (I got it through iTunes) but they do have an audio version of the summary book. [[ASIN:B00A8I1GLQ Wheat Belly...in 30 Minutes: A Concise Summary of Dr. William Davis's Bestselling Book]] The content of both books are informative but if you want the information without all the fluff get the summary version instead.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Excelente...
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Love this series.  Now all we need is the last season. Great science fiction.. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves sci-fi.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|App works well.  Game goes a little too fast for me.  I think kids would enjoy it except for having to wait to get more lives.  I like that limitation because it reminds me I have other things to do.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Have received but have not tried to use. Will be a gift for a niece. It looks to be in pretty good condition as advertised. Shipping time good.

B000002LAC|4.0|I love good country music. This being said I must add that that these three ladies have done much better music on their own than what you will find on this collaboration. Let me put it this way-I don't play it every week or even every month.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|They seriously need to make these games longer...by the time you finish, you'll just be craving for more...can't wait for the next one!!!
B0058DRUV6|5.0|The subject could have been very dry.  The author and support research base made the subject matter flow flawlessly.  A must read for up and comers.  I have worked for several companies.  The research is spot on in identifying average companies as well as Level 5 want to be leaders.

B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I really liked this book because it's really funny!Also because if you were in the situation Greg and Rodrick were in it would be really weird·
B004OR199G|2.0|After reading this book, I have to say that I am largely disappointed. Studies mentioned aren't cited and the book came off more as a personal statement/opinion. It is wonderful that the author's cancer appears stable since the time of her diagnosis, but what has worked for her and keeping her healthy may not necessarily work for other cancer patients, and is somewhat misleading in that it poses the lifestyle presented as a catch-all that will work in every case for every cancer. Unfortunately, due to the nature of cancer, a healthy lifestyle is sometimes not the only thing you need.<br /> Also, I take issue with some of her statements on dairy and the treatment of cows. Not all farms are bad, and milk goes through rigorous testing and is not \\"pus-filled\\" as is stated in the book. Milk comes through a teat lined with epithelial cells and there is some natural shedding of cells during the milking process, but in the case that the cow/cows has/have or is/are developing mastitis (an infection in the udder), and are infected then you will have \\"pus\\" in the milk and the cell counts will be higher in that milk. That milk will inevitably be discarded as the cell counts are above a certain level indicating there is a problem. Also, as a veterinarian, I have been on dairy farms. There are good farms where the cows are treated well, have time out in pasture, and are regularly checked for health issues.  Not all farms are perfect,and the system for manufacturing our food (live sources or otherwise) is not perfect, but it is unfair to those who are trying to do right by their livestock to say that all are awful and all are treated poorly.
B008EKMB82|5.0|A Tale for the Time Being stays with me, twirling in my mind, like the best of poetry does, or music.  It is that rare combination: page-turner and mind-bending, soul-enriching experience.<br /><br />What the book is &#34;about&#34; is difficult to express.  The story has been summarized by others.  It is clearly written, easy to follow, and absorbing.  In many ways it is a coming-of age-story -- or a coming-into-oneself story -- for both the girl who wrote the diary and the woman who found it.<br /><br />But just below the surface are a multitude of themes and symbols that move around, bumping into one another.  For me, at the heart, A Tale for the Time Being is about the existence of many worlds -- the ones we are born to or that happen to us (poverty, ethnicity, where home is), the ones we create (in choosing a mate, a home, a career, a new home, a way of life), the ones science has begun to surmise through quantum mechanics, the ones only our spirit can recognizes and bring forward (like the relationships between the living and the dead).  Most of all it seemed to be about a world a character creates for her author and the one the author creates for her character as they work together.<br /><br />I might agree with some of the faults expressed by others.  I, too, was more interested in Nao than in Ruth.  However, by the time I finished the book and figured out what it was doing, I thought even that was as it should be.<br /><br />This book is breathtaking.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|This is an all time favorite movie with 3 excellent actors including Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi Goldburg. All gave excellent performances. Good price and great shipping time

B000FBFN1U|3.0|Lots of good action and intrigue to keep the pace up on this one.  Some nice unexpected turns as well.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|The things that I liked about MapsWithMe Lite are that the maps look good and scroll fluidly. Street names are easy to see and read. Zooming is smooth as well. It is Kindle compatible and works offline, which was they key feature for me.<br /><br />Some of the things I didn't like are the lack of turn-by-turn directions, lack of address search (available with paid version), and the maps do not display the street names when you are zoomed out. For example, if you are looking at a state or whole county, you can see the major roads and interstate highways, but they will not be labeled until you zoom in further. Smaller roads do seem to be labeled at the appropriate level.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Only picked it up because of the movie coming out this summer. Glad I did pick it up. Was an enjoyable read.
B007R41E8O|3.0|Kindle Fire HD. Download wasn't as bad as others have mentioned via WiFi. Took maybe 20 mins. I've been really into the mystery games lately and can't give this one more than three stars. There were persistent issues with the game stopping and the application having to start up again, taking me back to places I'd already been. I was able to finish so these were more an annoyance than anything else. I give it only three stars as I didn't find the game to be very intuitive. I don't mind going back several times to complete HO's in the same spot to find various items as long as I know I'm supposed to go there. But in this game, I had no reason to return to these areas so I was using the hint button constantly to provide direction on where to go next. Visual quality was good ... I just didn't find the clues sufficient enough to stay on track and progress. I was very grateful for the quick reload time of that hint button!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I just discovered Firefly and, like all the other browncoats of the world, can't believe they cancelled this show. It's awesome.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Excellent movie I totally recommend it to any one. With this package you have it all digital copy, bluray (3d) & DVD
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Mostly uninspiring music, but a classic story. I was really disappointed by the score. Other than a few memorable moments, it was generally vapid.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Why do so many people whine that this isn't the original?  If you want the original, got at it, enjoy.<br /><br />Why would they want to make the same movie they made thirty years ago? They did quirky / scary and did it well before (and then again in Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness).  Maybe they wanted to do something else?<br /><br />I sneaked into the movie theater when the original hit the screens back in the early eighties and as much as I love it, I can also appreciate what they did in this reworking. This movie was a new take on a great idea, not just a crappy remake.  This move was 'jumpy', gross and exciting.<br /><br />I thought it was great fun and I'll be getting the blu-ray for sure.
0307730697|5.0|Great book. I am trying to go Marine Corps Officer, and I still find this book is very motivational. One of those that is worth the read.
B000FBFM9S|3.0|Quirky book with quirky characters. Or maybe eccentric is a better choice of words. This is actually a good book; however, it personally took me too long to get into the characters. Four months, but I struggled through and finished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Especially the season finale!  What a great ending, can't wait for the next season to come around!!  Be sure to check it out.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|I read this book not realizing how much I would find out about myself and that was a nice surprise.  I would recommend it for anyone as it will help in personal relationships and work settings.  I am reading it a second time and I hope to find out more.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I think this is the best Les Miserables concert ever, incredible performances, great quality, highly recommended if you are a fan of the play.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What a talented lady Lindsey is with her Violin!  I discovered her after her work with the piano guys.  Love love love the ORIGINAL songs she has put out and also a lot of others not even on this Album.  Each song has a lot of energy and just watching her dance around makes me tired... but her videos are also top notch.  In addition to this album I highly recommend checking out her Lord of the Rings song, Skyrim song, and &#34;We got Love&#34; on youtube.  Lindsey is truly someone special with an amazing talent!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|totally awesome! just got it tonight and I had a full battery and now only 15% left fromnjust playing this!
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Plot was a little iffy , but quality on Amazon Prime was awesome.  It is tough to compete against the original Bourne series, but still worth watching!
B007FO5PYK|5.0|Great movie, excellent performance of Al Pacino.  It´s the kind of movie where the student taught the master that life is good and that you must enjoy it.  A new classic.
B008NABUU8|5.0|reminds me of bridgeit back in the early 2000's. good levels I found it just complicated enough to keep me interested
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This was a book full of suspense sadness and sheer joy but it's not neerly the book the original maze runner was.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I love watching these two!  The show is funny without being too serious, if you know what I mean.  It's very well done because, face it, the stuff they come up with is corny...but they producers and writers make it work.  And do I have to say anything about Sam and Dean being fun to watch!?
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I am so pleased with the case for my Kindle.  I have gotten many comments and questions about whether I like it and I always say I love it...
B006ZNRD06|2.0|ont sure if I am doing something wrong or what but this app does not work on my Acer A200 talblet
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|The graphics were excellent.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  Compared to some other HO games this one is on the easy side, but there are still challenges and several hours of escape and fun.  And, after all, that is why we play these things, isn't it? I had no difficulty at all running it on my Kindle Fire.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love Lucy and they make a great team!  It's a little predictable but still entertaining and do look forward to watching it each week.  I'm also glad that it has more than 13 episodes to a season.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the mental challenge surrounding the geometric structure of these puzzles. Also a great aid in teaching a geometry class and making it fun.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|a good story, a more realistic and darker Harry Potter character, keeps you wondering what is going to happen next
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|I would have given this four and a half stars, but couldn't get my mouse to agree.  Excellent excellent graphics.  This is a beautiful game.  It is well thought out and the hidden objects are at least findable, not clear off the screen the way they are in some HO games.  The puzzles are clever.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes HOGs.  It is worth the purchase price.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|A really engrossing first half of the book, but the writer plays all the story's cards too early and the momentum completely dissolves once the major twists are revealed and never quite recovers.  A clever premise but the ending was completely preposterous!
1451627297|5.0|Although this book as four THOUSAND reviews, I will tack on one more.  It is an amazing piece of fiction.  Possibly the best ever from the best ever.  The characters and story are absolutely top shelf quality.  You feel like you are truly taken on a journey in a way that books so rarely achieve.  While of course the time-travel premise of the story is not possible, most of the events and actions of the characters are entirely believable.  For any fan of fiction (yes that is a GIANT category), this is an absolute must-read.  Long live The King!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Aside from  his  eloquent writing style, the author has managed to present a very topical social issue without prejudice.  The web of social media today is very complex and  can allow everyone to have a life unknown to even close friends and family.  The question posed by William Landay, &#34;What if...?&#34;  resonates.
B00C4SUEJI|5.0|What more can I say. Its a great album. They continue to evolve without losing the core songwriting that makes I&W so great. Sam Beam lets his pand play and they are all great musicians. It is interesting enough get lost in while by yourself in your room yet one could listen to it on any drive around town. Pretty much all you need to do is buy this ablum and never stop listening to it.
B005D6O0IO|4.0|I have two types of ballet types from crocs and they do not make the squishy \\"fart\\" sounds as this style does for my foot.  I have wide feet so it may just be my foot size and not the shoe type itself, and may work for narrow feet.  I prefer the Kadee or Malindi.
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you want an excellent weather app, this is IT! Tells you everything - radar, 10-day forecast, you can save multiple locations, has weather alerts. Basically this is the perfect weather app!
0446572985|3.0|I had never read a book by this author before, but the cover caught my interest so I thought I'd give it a try.  Having spent some time in DC, the stark image of an assassin standing next to a teenage girl with the Washington Monument caught my eye.  Excellent marketing.  Most of the story runs at a good pace.  There are some plot holes in the book.  The protagonist does seem to be a bit forced into continually getting involved in situations he normally wouldn't get involved in.  This leads to a plot that is a bit convoluted and in the end, rushed.  I didn't really like how at some points the characters had to make leaps of logic to get to the next step in solving a riddle.  Many plot points aren't really resolved until the very end of the book and then its all done by exposition.<br /><br />I think Baldacci does have a good pace overall for this novel and I really enjoyed reading about parts of DC and the surrounding area.  He knows his stuff and does a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for many of the scenes.  I'll give him another try.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Reaches out and grabs you......and holds on with every word and sub-plot.  Picoult has done it again!  Don't miss this one!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Great series, been hearing about if for a long time but courtroom drama isn't something that draws me in. Definitely not just courtroom drama though good complex characters and good story lines. Definitely will cbtubye watching
B00ABO609A|3.0|I admit this movie was good on the merit of acting alone - it was completely believable. You found yourself believing you were a fly on the wall watching a real-life situation. But to me the movie felt like it was building up to making some point and it just didn't. I can't say that I can accurately describe what the point of this movie was.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is very fun to pass the time. I enjoy this game tremendously. I recommend this game to anyone with a love for building and expanding.
B0000CAXID|5.0|Who would have thought that the drummer for Nirvana would go on to front a rock band that would sell out two nights at Wembley Stadium and would win numerous Grammys? It may not have seemed possible back in 1995 when Dave Grohl released this debut album under the name Foo Fighters but this modest record set all of those wheels in motion. From its catchy tunes and sci-fi album cover it's worthy of the hype and a great place to start if you're looking to get into the group's discography.<br /><br />The album's sound is full and heavy, compliments of Grohl playing every instrument himself. Except for a brief guitar cameo from Greg Dulli there's not another musician in sight, making it all the more impressive how quickly and efficiently this album was recorded. \\"This is a Call\\" opens the album with a charm and effervescent melody that immediately draws you in. Follow that with \\"I'll Stick Around\\" and you have two of the band's most beloved and memorable tunes. As if that weren't enough, the brief but irresistible pop of \\"Big Me\\" might just be my favorite on the album. And who can forget the hilarious music video, a spoof of all the old Mentos commercials? It's always good to see a group who doesn't take themselves too seriously.<br /><br />The hits aren't the only songs that work. \\"Floaty\\" begins with just an acoustic guitar before the rest of the instruments kick in, allowing Dave's double-tracked vocals to really shine. \\"Good Grief\\" barrels along with an intensity and catchy bounce that would come to dominate their later recordings. Grohl didn't forget his punk roots either, as \\"Wattershed\\" and \\"Weenie Beenie\\" (yeah, I don't know what that title is supposed to mean either) are great for fans of hardcore music and plenty of screaming.<br /><br />All 12 songs work and while some are better than others, there really isn't anything here that sounds like complete filler. I suppose that's the advantage of Dave saving all of his best songs throughout the years and recording them all at once. He manages to give the tracks a full and robust sound, giving the impression that a full band is present if you didn't know he did all the work. There's a simple charm to all of it and you can't help but have fun while listening.<br /><br />Greater things would come later but this is still a fine album that's more than worth your time. As far as debuts go, this one is a stellar starting point.them all at once.

B008LA7RM0|5.0|I love all the early Beach Boys surfer music. For years I knew of the existence of Pet Sounds and thought it HAD to be a ridiculous piece of work given the title. Boy, was I wrong. Lately, I ran across an interview of Paul McCartney were he gives Pet Sounds high praise, even shedding tears when he listens to God Only Knows. So I decided, OK, time to bite the apple. All I can say is: Wow! Wilson managed to reach into some magic space and pull this stuff out of the ether. I've listened to Pet Sounds many times now. It became one of my instant favorites, and I'm very pleased to have discovered it. Thanks Brian!

B000001DTM|5.0|\\"I'm ready, ready for the laughing gas/I'm ready, ready for what's next.\\" These opening words ushered U2 into the 90's, complete with Bono's distorted voice and the industrial sounds of the band behind him. After 20 years it still sounds like nothing else out there and it signaled a new phase and a new decade for the four Irish rockers. Achtung Baby was described by Bono as \\"the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree\\" and the heavy European sounds of the album couldn't be further from the sound that made them famous in the 80's.<br /><br />Achtung Baby is also the record that nearly did the band in. After the worldwide success of The Joshua Tree, the band followed it up with the album and film Rattle and Hum. It was met with mixed critical reception and the band began looking for ways to reinvent themselves and take a different path. Things were initially rough and the band was on the verge of breaking up when the album's penultimate song, \\"One\\", came about and saved the day. It gave the band the strength and unity to finish the record and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Everyone knows the hits: \\"One\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\", \\"The Fly\\". It's hard to imagine a time when these songs were new and shocking because they've been with us for so long, yet they still resonate. U2 went from exploring American and blues music to delving into industrial and dance sounds. I was only a small child when this album was released and I wish I could have been there to see the public's reaction. It was a completely different take on the band and no one knew what to make of it. The band's sound, image, and presence was radically different, with the band using irony to poke fun at themselves and the culture around them. The entire Zoo TV Tour was built upon this principle, a world where the media and information overload were rampant and mind-numbing. While this may not seem astonishing to us in 2011, in 1991 the internet had not yet come into its own and 24-hour news was just catching on. U2 could see the writing on the wall and were ahead of the curve, mocking these new institutions and predicting that they would consume the culture and the public in a negative fashion.<br /><br />The tone of the album is also darker than previous records. Achtung Baby is essentially a lovers' quarrel, with songs that explore betrayal, uncertainty, desperation, frustration, and couples who use each other in deceptive and cheap ways. Granted, there's always hope in the songs, a trademark of U2 that has always been present. However, this was the first time that the band had explored such dark and personal depths of love in such gritty detail. \\"So Cruel\\" is the ultimate breakup song and \\"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\\" implies a relationship in which laziness is rampant and love is so minuscule that only ultraviolet light can see it. \\"Until the End of the World\\" describes the betrayal of Jesus through the eyes of Judas and the closer \\"Love is Blindness\\" lives up to its namesake. Needless to say, these are not happy tales and they face the real struggles and trials that all relationships have to endure.<br /><br />It's not all bleak or hopeless. \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is pure fun and \\"Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World\\" is a bit more upbeat. The band used irony and occasional tongue-in-cheek moments to keep things fresh, a tactic they've been able to balance out quite well over the years. Bono's lyrics are inspired as always, digging deep and hitting their mark in a meaningful and personal way. The Edge contributes some of his best guitar work here, with effects and memorable riffs permeating nearly every track. Not to be outdone, Larry and Adam both prove why they're the best rhythm section in music. Their playing is focused, groovy, and heavy. The entire album just feels and sounds perfect.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece and is considered by many fans and critics to be the band's best work. It was a defining moment in the band's career and arguably the finest reinvention ever conceived by a musical artist. It also paved the way for further experimentation with the albums Zooropa and Pop. This is my second-favorite U2 album (right behind The Joshua Tree) and it's a record that everyone needs to hear. It's influenced so much of today's music and U2 was ahead of the trends, as usual. With the recent re-release of the album, now is the perfect time to pick it up if you haven't before. \\"And you can dream, so dream out loud.\\"ng moment in the band's career and arguably the finest reinvention ever conceived by a musical artist.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In a dystopian future, most if not all of the planets population spends their time logged into an online simulation called the OASIS, giving them an excuse to forget the bleak world around them known as reality. Soon after the death of the OASIS's extremely wealthy and eccentric creator, his Last Will and Testament is broadcast all over the world: that the heir to his fortune and the OASIS itself will go to he or she who can find the clues and complete the quests that are hidden within the massive online world he created. Wade Watts, a poor orphan in real life, and an extremely low-level avatar in the OASIS, will be the first person to find the first clue. How that happened...and what happened next is what you will have to read for yourself.<br /><br />**Personal Notes** Mixed with one part Hunger Games, one part World of Warcraft (or Second Life), Ready Player One will be an exceptionally enjoyable read for those of us who were born and raised through the 80's, and fell in love with the movies and music of that decade, as well as the birth of video gaming and life of video gaming! This book is PACKED with quotes and references from movies, video games, and music most popular in the 80's, and recognizing those quotes and references was as big as an enjoyment as the story itself. A must read for gamers and movie buffs alike.<br /><br />**Online research has shown me that the rights to this story have already been picked up by a major motion picture company, much like &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34;. FYI
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Asking This Movie Was Long, Drawn Out, And Boring. It'sTwo Hours Of Two SpOiled Children Cursing at ThIer Parents. I Kept AlongMyself...Is it Over Yet?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son and I both play this game. It is lots of fun and it's engaging. I catch myself laughing out loud trying to keep up with it.<br />You have to be fast in order to collect all the coins in the subway.
B00BZBP44K|4.0|it starts off really well and the performance of course is amazing, but after the intermission, yes there's an intermission, it really bogs down.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|What a read! I LOVED the series, and the end was satisfying. I look forward to a few more works by Brandon Sanderson.
B005FVNIW6|2.0|I bought this book as it was mentioned often in lists of adventure novels.  I read 75% of it and was still waiting for something to happen.  YAWN.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This was the perfect Easter present for my son.  He loves Jack Frost. Its a fun movie that everyone can enjoy.
630469654X|5.0|Another gem of a movie that I wanted to have in my collection ever since I saw it on cable.  Now, I have my own copy and can watch it any time I want to.
B000FBFM9S|4.0|Well written and interesting, funny at times.  Over all...just not my cup of tea.  I felt exhausted by it (that may well have been the intent) but I certainly didn't gain any new understanding of the people and situation.  It was pretty much as sad as I thought.  I didn't feel like I had a depth of experience of any of the characters (but I know others did).  It was hard to finish.  I guess it represents a particular viewpoint - which is cool - just not as riveting as I expected.  (I know lots of interesting people who complain about their mess up lives - and most of them have a better story.)
B00BU18U82|4.0|So far this is a pretty good game.  A suggestion for better game play would be the inclusion of animals to look after, sell etc, as that would add another level that could elevate this game. What I am not over the moon about is having to spend money not only on the game, but also on new machinery. There are certain items that you can only unlock, and to do so that is to spend money. This is otherwise a very put together game, but some of the things can be improved.<br /><br />Also, this game is a dollar less on the Play store.
B002WJI63A|5.0|I bought this plush for my baby. The material is great and well designed. Since i got it, my baby does not stop playing with it.
0800141849|5.0|This movie was such a pleasant surprise when I first saw it, so I wanted to buy it.  It was so easy to do so on your site.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Saw the guys on pbs,loved them,bought them, still LOVE them !!!!!! I cant, wait to get their next cd !!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I know that in app purchases are never going away but I am sick and tired of being nickeled and dimed to death just to play a game.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use on a daily basis for communication with my daughter and son.I have only a visa check card that I use.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This was another movie I wanted to add to my collection.  Getting it as a &#34;special edition&#34; was a plus!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I've read this book twice it needs to be read twice the stories of when he was younger at the beginning are worth a read which is where he puts in a story but also advice and the part after that is mostly the how of writing and most of the things I highlighted and shared would recommend to any potential writer of if u enjoys story's about famous people's younger years
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thought it was based on a true story and I would recommend it to everyone, especially to one's that have been adopted and how bad the cathalic church cod be.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have plants vs zombies for ds and it has the zen garden and mini games but this one dosent
0425252868|5.0|This is one of those stories that you can't put down. Not only is it a great insight into the horrors of war but also a personal account of human personality during wartime.
B00BJ6AJT6|5.0|One of my favorite musicians. Listening to her always makes me smile. To me it's a mini vacation to France.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This is an intense graphic show (cable I'd rate it &#34;R&#34;) if in a movie, but interesting story line and makes draws you into the next episode!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I absolutely love this book and the movie this is a very well written book I love it so much
B00C4SUEJI|3.0|Probably not my favorite Iron & Wine album, but anything Sam Beam does is pretty amazing ;P<br /><br />asdas asddasfsd asdf
B008HLZUUE|1.0|After being glued to my chair reading books 1-3, I found the fourth book to be much too slow, lacking in action and wasting too much time in descriptions and on the same subjects. The author could have really summarize this whole book in 4-5 chapters. Left too many loose ends and skipped others completely. I feel cheated. Looks like Martin had already decided to extend the series in one more book (hopefully just one more...) and intentionally wrote a lazy piece and left the good stuff for later.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book be a use I saw the movie and it made me feel amazing. The book was spectacular as well. I am glad to know I'm not alone in feeling the way Charlie feels. I feel like this is one of my favorite books I've ever read. The writer was wise and moved me. This book will forever be with me. I am greatly appreciative for this book and the movie. Thank you.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|Not great.  It is slow.  It lags about 10 to 15 minutes with updates. Other than that the info is pretty much what you need.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This was an fascinating and in-depth exploration of the driving forces behind history. It ends up being a bit repetitive, simply because the author makes the same point in a few different ways. Still, absolutely worth a read.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I kept this headset for one night before returning it.  The sound was good for the few minutes I used it before a buzzing started in the left ear.  I finished the match I was in and cycled power on the headset and the transmitter. I then went on Teamspeak and every one of my clanmates instantly remarked on how different I sounded.  The pitch was off and there was a slight reverb.  I even verified that one of the stupid voice changing gimmicks wasn't enabled.  Nope, just bad audio.  I then tried Skype and had the same reaction.  &#34;Are you on speakerphone?&#34; and &#34;Are you calling me from the bathroom?  You're not %^$&&*^%, are you?&#34; are not the first things I want to hear from people I Skype. I even fired up Audacity and recorded myself with my old wired Earforce and compared it to the G930.  The Earforce sounded great, the G930 sounded like garbage.  If you are 10 and want to use the voice changer nonsense, and you don't mind an occasional really loud buzzing in one ear, this might be the headset for you. If you want people to hear you the way you sound, and don;t like loud buzzing in one ear, skip it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is a great game!  The puzzles are just difficult enough to keep you interested and playing!  The graphics are beautifully done and will leave you mesmerized.  I would easily give it five stars if it had been a little longer, for that I have to give it four.  It hinted at more to come, I will definitely be looking for them!
B000FA675C|5.0|Why did I wait so long to read this book?  It lived up to all the hype!  I loved it!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I couldn't stop reading these damn books. I finished them and felt a little bad about myself. The writing was poor and the story was over the top. Total guilty pleasure.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was amazed by the integrity of accuracy that the author adhered to in her research for the book. It truly awakened me to Lincoln's greatness! The obstacles he overcame throughout his life... His astute handling of his cabinet members... The movie was entertaining but a disappointment in its portrayal of Lincoln.Titling it \\"Lincoln\\" was misconceiving. It should have been titled \\"The 13th Ammendment\\" as that was all it covered.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I would recommend reading it before the second movie comes out.  Good story line with interesting turns and unexpected events.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was a bit surprised by the ending- it certainly made me think and is a change from the typical American fairytale ending
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series!! I watched the entire season in 3 days!!  By the way, seasons 1 and 2 are available on Netflix.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|This movie can be difficult to watch at times. The subject matter is one reason and the violence is another. I was relieved to see that no horses were injured and the Humane Society gave the movie it's seal of approval. The music is excellent as well as the scenery. The acting is also quite good in addition to the costumes. The movie is very long but I watched it in 2 parts.
B00BU18U82|4.0|I live on a ranch help with the farming, and this is fun to play. I am 14 years old.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|It can be silly and the the sci-fi hoaky,but wow their are such poignant moments,that i keep returning to this show. Give it a chance and it will grow on you.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of my favorite romantic movies of all time!!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies because they will love it!  It is a love story that lasts a lifetime!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Good short version of &#34;It&#34;, except now its a human eating mudball posing as a car. I am a devoted King fan, but this one was a little formulaic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game so far, I have played Pc version and xbox360 version and so far it is living up to its name. Very smooth graphics on kindle fire, and samsung galaxy player 3.6. Very addicting and doesn't get old. doesn't take up to much storage space so I don't have to delete my other apps.<br /><br />Some things it needs to add.<br />Redstone!!!!! Along with pressure plates and stuff.<br />Next big thing is commands. /gamemode is a must in future updates.<br />Also xp and enchantment table.<br />Make worlds infinite.<br />Add skins, texture packs,and maybe mods.<br />And most of all....ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. Nonlinear multiplayer would help your reviews so much, and I know if you jailbreak an ipod that you can do online Mp. so why cant you guys implement it when you have professional developers.<br /><br />So anyways its great and I am looking forward to next update with buckets among other things. Thanks for creating such a great game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great read!  Grisham always keeps me guessing until the very end.  This was a fun read too.  It was one of those books that keeps me up later than I should be.  Lost a bit of sleep this week, but it was well worth it!  I'd love to see this one turned into a movie!!
B00190OHD6|5.0|I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes romantic and funny movies.  It has a lot of heart, and if you are like me, it will surely make you shed a tear or many more!  Loved it!
B005PK57IK|5.0|im hopeing you put season 4 on prime  free im a big fan of the show  but I cant offord to pay to watch it.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Because I couldn't figure out what the heck I was doing but once I figured you had to do the normal match 3 but not by dragging but by tapping one and swapping the correct gem I had it made...i thought. But the part that had me horn-doggled was how to match any others once the obvious were done.  I finally figured it out when I hit the \\"Hint\\" button and it told me to double tap any jewel to rotate the piece!  Ah HA! After using the Hint button a few times to get the feel for it (I'm playing in casual mode) I finally got it and it's a BLAST!!! And it's a long playing game as there is a button on the bottom right and you change the gem for the rings and it starts fresh all over again.<br /><br />Playing on a Kindle Fire HD and I highly recommend this game!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is one of the best games I have ever played until I held the power button down to reset my kindle and all of my progress deleted. The files were still there but none of my progress saved, it all deleted.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline and the graphics were great..really the only thing I don't like is the price... $5 a game means I won't be able to check out all the games they offer :(
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a little tough at first because of the hardships the main character suffers through, but in the end it was a very satisfying read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app! I love Pinterest on PC, but on Kindle Fire?! Best thing ever created for Kindle Fire!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|After watching this, I thought of a movie I watched in the past called Inception (I had forgotten the title, had to look it up). Fortunately, this movie delivers beautifully and precisely what Inception should have. Political, philosophical, dramatic, a little action, and very thought-provoking, this movie gives your mind and imagination something to linger long after the credits roll. It either gives you hope or causes you to give up all hope. Enjoy it...or not (if they don't want you to).
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Very different approach really trains your will power. Much easier than very prescriptive diets and I have lost a few pounds since starting.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|I had feeling that I read Tolstoy &#34;War and Peace&#34;, so many battle descriptions related to actual story developments. Otherwise good ending of the story.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|It has a frantic start, then slows way down, half way through it picks up again. In General a good read.!!!!
B004LE7PCM|5.0|I love Conan Doyle text. As an english learner read in english is very important. Sherlock Holmes adventures is very nice and interesting.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Really I enjoyed both the book and the film. Usually I like fantasy and write fantasy stories, but \\"Safe Haven\\" I enjoyed much.<br />I recommend to read or else to watch the film.<br /><br />Suren Hakobyan-the author of the book [[ASIN:B00CD7QQB0 Daredevils of Sassoun - Sanasar and Baghdasar]]
B008JF8O9M|1.0|The App did not even have my printer listed. I used the default settings for my printer and it stated that it connected. But it would not print. Not worth wasting your time
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the series. What a great read. I read it on IPad/Kindle and did not realize it was at the end. It just....ended. I was very disappointed with the ending to a fabulous series
B001NLL93W|5.0|5 Stars for wonderful story line.  Keeps you on your seat wondering what is coming next and who is really the good guy and who isnt.  Surprise ending!  Loved every minute of every character.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's addictive and a lot of fun.<br />I love this game.<br />Great game that's surprising that it would be a free game.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|Since i have downloaded the Adblock Plus App, i have not had any ads when i play games that were free. This was so amazing at first, Then the very next day my Kindle was not moving. Webpages take forever to open if they ever do, same with Amazon Store, Facebook, ect.. Now when i open an App, it will automatically stop and when i restart it the App works.<br /><br />Deleting from my Kindle. Do not DOWNLOAD!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really great story, I couldn't put it down. The characteriztion and plot was riveting. I really enjoyed the action in this book
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I liked this book the first time I read it and it still is an enjoyable journey unto the mind of the undead.
0440237688|5.0|If you want to read a story of a different culture, this book will get you thinking.  What led to the formation and dictated the laws in place?  How would you deal with living under the rules of this community?  This novel will have you enthralled and questioning.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Within seconds the Clean Master gets rid of all the garbage on your Kindle that you didnt even know was there. It is amazing how much is collected and stored on your device from running Apps to Web Surfing.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Not only is this a gripping, unimaginable story of valor and survival, it honors the lives of those who fight for our country's safety. It also highlights the fact that our service people are at a huge disadvantage when it comeS to war and the fact that our armed forces are often more of afraid of our liberal media than the enemy trying to kill them and us.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I just thought it was a really good good book and you should make some more Jeff you are a really talented and awesome please make some more
B000TDGGRY|5.0|Wow...what a ride!  Rollins weaves a fabulous tapestry that is<br />beyond words. His books keep getting better and better. Will always look forward to his next one!!!
B005E89X7E|5.0|Awesome book by an awesome writer. Find myself not being able to put the book down once i start reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Very well done mr. Howey!  I'm ready for some more wool!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The best movie i have ever seen :)))))) in 2013! Too late but better late than never!!!!!!!:) the song the funnnnnnnnny bela's and i never knew this girls can sing. Perfect for everyone!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|Great for young teens. With this being by Green, I was expecting a different ending. I also recommend The Fault In Our Stars
B003G4W49C|4.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is a book that I've had on my wish list for a long time. I'm glad I finally bought it, but I'm sad it took me so long to give the book a try! It is a coming of age sci-fi adventure for a young prodigy named Andrew, whose nickname is Ender. The story follows Ender as he grows from an awkward boy to a hardened battle leader.<br /><br />The story bounces between Ender's viewpoint and that of his minders who shape his rapid growth and learning so he will be able to fight against a devastating alien race known as the Buggers. While the name of the enemy sounds a bit childish, the story telling is far from that as it explores what it is like to be an outcast because of one's extraordinary skills and abilities.<br /><br />In addition to Ender's story, there is some politic intrigue as we learn about Ender's two siblings, who also possesses knowledge and drive well beyond their years. This part of the story was underplayed, but I think it is likely to come to the forefront in later novels.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book, and I'm looking forward to exploring other books in the Ender series.
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|This series is absolutely fantastic!  It has everything a user would want to watch ... fairy tales, the good, the bad, fantasy, heroines, heros ... absolutely anything you want.  I'm almost finished with the first season but am going straight through to the second and third seasons.  ABC has done an exceptional job with this fantasy series and has set the bar for other networks and productions.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We love GoT, my wife and I, but we hate the high costs of cable and the &#34;bloatwatch&#34;, all the channels you will never, never watch, no matter how bored you get on a day you're home sick. So we wait for this to come out every year and have a marathon. The Blu Ray edition is well worth it, a crisp transfer, great storytelling, and a marvelous cast. Worth it for the Battle of the Blackwater alone (is George RR Martin a Doobie Brothers fan?), this is one of the few DVD's we buy, because we will watch it again, The extras are good, you really need to watch it three times just to get them all in. Of course, if you like GoT already, you don't really need to be sold on this......
B002U3CCF6|4.0|'Sharp Objects' was a confrontational and riveting read..Its twists and turns cunningly lead the reader to an inevitable but unbelievable conclusion !! Unputdownable !!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best book ever!!! :)<br /><br />The best book ever nothing can ever compare it's just that awesome. That's why it's my favorite book ever!!! :) :) :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is difficult to put down. This is the very first boom I've read by the author.  I enjoyed The Innocent so much; I just purchased The forgotten and I pre-ordered The Hit.
B00136NUG6|4.0|I've always enjoyed E,W, and F, one of the few people to reimagine the Beatles well (Got to get You Into My Life), and fun, feel good songs like &#34;September&#34; and &#34;Sing a Song&#34; - it was a great deal on special as an MP3. There are just times, viscerally, when a body's just got to have some R&B................
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is long so make sure that you are in it for the long run. The plot line keeps you interested and here is something about the characters that you can relate.
0345803485|4.0|My husband wanted to read Fifty Shades of Gray so I ordered it for him.  My husband NEVER reads a book and I thought to myself that it would just sit on bookshelf.  However, he read it cover to cover and said he wanted the next 2 books of the trilogy.  I ordered them and decided I would read the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey.  In my opinion, it was very well written and the characters became real.  I would recomend to any adult who woud not be offended by the erotic, sexual content.  Even though the characters were well described, I can't help but wonder how the writer could write the &#34;sex&#34; scenes without personal experience.  I am hoping E. L. James will write other (perhaps a little less sexually descriptive) books.  Wow.
B005XZHQKY|4.0|Too bad they didn't make this for grown-ups.  Great 3D effects, but the audio commentary is for a 7-yr-old!  With all that space on a Blu-Ray disc, they could have done a second audio track for adults.  Make it educational as well as beautiful!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|I mean seriously, a 1966 concert, at the Sands, in Vegas, with Sinatra backed by Count Basie? Got You Under My Skin&#34;, &#34;Come Fly With Me&#34;, even &#34;One O'Clock Jump&#34;, just well produced, well crafted songs by two men at the top of their game. 22 songs, not a weak entry, by one of Jim Morrison's favorite singers (he loved Sinatra's phrasing). I can't recommend it enough, the best Sinatra record I've heard in a while.
B009FZFONO|5.0|While I was in the middle of catching up on Season 2 on Netflix a friend told me that Season 3 was even better.  At first, I didn't believe him and now I'm a true believer.  WALKING DEAD keeps pushing the envelope on what it means to be alive versus what it means to survive.  I'm looking forward to what the writers come up with next and if they can keep going strong in the next season.<br /><br />Also, I saw this on Amazon Instant Video and was impressed with the image quality and upload speed.  A good investment for fans like me who don't have cable but are too impatient to wait for Netflix.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|This is a nice period story about young love, and the importance of having the right attitude. It will take away our stressful timeperiod and transport you too a simpler time. Enjoy:-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it!! I would read it again. I actually cryed at the end. I wo.t give it away, read it!!
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Enjoyed the movie when viewed on a cable channel.  Wanted to purchase to add to my movie collection.  Good acting.
B0098460O4|4.0|All selections are in Italian by both singers; very slight amount of CD in English.  The singing is better than their days on Britain's Got Talent.  A delightment in listening.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Picked it on a whim and sat mesmerized during the entire movie.  Since I'm not the type to write spoiler reviews, just watch it and see for yourself.  Quirky, off-beat, and extremely entertaining, I gave it 5 stars for its originality and fearlessness in trying some very unique imagery (wait until you encounter the outhouse scene!)
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is an older version and my kids loved it so got it for the daycare.  Great if you need a little break.
B000003N7K|5.0|Purchased for a friend but benefitted from the download.  Great music - This music is enjoyable and would recommend to others.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|I didn't know these were taken from comic books!  They fun even though they are violent--it's not the scary over the top blood and gore of most of today's chain saw genre.  Kate Beckinsale is just right.  Imagine an imp being able to toss around wolves--what a kick.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|A feel good movie, but definitely worth the watch.  I also love Girard Butler !  I would watch again.<br />What is with the word count on reviews?
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you update this mojang please. And this is a great game since I don't have enough money for the pc version
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I'm not into gaming apps but this is a nice little way to kill about 10-20 minutes of your day.
0525953728|5.0|Fast easy read for someone familiar with spl  ops.<br /><br />Contrary to all the bogus Obama administration hoopla, there is no compromise of classified information contained in the contents.<br /><br />The story sets the stage well and reveals what really led up to OBL's take down.
B002YRZ1VA|5.0|I love all of Chaka Khan's music!  I downloaded this CD, especially for &#34;Papillion&#34; and &#34;Tell me Something Good&#34;. I'm enjoying it on my Kindle.
0143118757|5.0|As a hard negotiator who typically has had problems with the impact of getting what I want from traditional negotiating, this book was something of a revelation for me. I thoroughly appreciated having a more efficient way to not only get what I want, but to maintain my interpersonal relationships in the process. Would recommend to anyone who has to interact with human beings for any reason at all. Business, personal, it's all basically applicable. [Accidentally posted this review on another book lol. Guess they got a 5 star rating off of your effort!]
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very fun and challenging Space Invaders type game. I got this as a free app of the day from Amazon, but it is well worth a few dollars.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|So different! I couldn't put it down.  Will recommend it to my friends. It made me want to have an encyclopedia<br />on the meaning of flowers.
B000002OZY|5.0|A musical master piece. No modern rock composer can honestly claim not to be influenced by it. The music, arrangements and vocals are sublime.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just want to know when the next season is coming out??  Each season gets better and better!  Strongly recommended to watch!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is not like any other you have ever seen because it is a complete musical/movie<br />with the actors singing and acting through the whole movie. If you like musicals or action<br />packed adventures or you just enjoy a great love story, then this ones for you. Check it out<br />do not take my word for it...............
B00APUQRPC|3.0|A lot of potential here, but unfortunately it sticks too close to the old formulas.  Hard to say more without spoilers . . ..
B004LM72ZY|5.0|My 2 year old grandson has had a long lasting fascination with rockets.  Got this for his 2nd birthday.  Oh my - what a huge hit.  I can't tell you how many, many hours of fun he has had with this.  I love it because it's simple.  No bells or whistles, batteries, flashing lights or electronic sounds.  Just imagination!  The rocket separates into 2 pieces with a twist, which the hands of my grandson can easily handle - but it was a skill to learn.  Cute little playmobil figure astronaut fits into the bottom piece.  Highly recommend.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|The second season carried into history of wives and establishment of Church of England. The main reason for leaving Catholic Church because of new wife. Enjoyed second season, but as in first, not sure of historical accuracy but entertaining.
B005LAII62|4.0|Went to see this with my best friend and her two kids. The 10 year old and the 15 year old both enjoyed it, and both us adults loved it. It was a fun movie, not too scary, and has a happy ending. The effects were pretty good, and the storyline was creative and good. There are a couple of sad moments and some that may be scary to extremely young kids, but it is overall a safe movie for all ages and a good family film. It was good enough that I bought it after seeing it in the theater.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not only myself, but everyone who sees this series finds it stunning.  The casting is perfect.  The sets, costuming, plots and acting superb.  I may be partial to British early century life, but it's largely due to this magnifricent portrayal of Edwardian life surrounding the first war.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This new AMD CPU kicks butt and is a great buy for the money Would recommend it for most computer use.<br />Fast service also for Amazon.com
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great opening season into history of Henry VIII. First establishing key members of his court. Introduction of different historical players. Not sure hoe close if follows history but interesting.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good graphics and game play. A fun game to play on kindle fire. Controls are easy to use and intuitive.
B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Some people board A boat just to take A little sailing trip.But one the women has A look that some things wrong they run into some bad luck and are forced to take shelter on A ocean liner thats deserted,and before one of the people realize that she is repeating the same two or three days over and over.Lets be real this movie plainly speaking was bad.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE this book.  It makes me want more than what I've settled for. I just could not get enough and I hope the talk of a movie is true. You can call it mommy porn if you want. But this mama has read the trilogy 3 times and still can't get enough.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I would recommend this book!  Sad, funny, sexy and a great story!  Can't wait to read the next book!
B001BKAEHW|5.0|Love John Mayer! He makes music that you don't hear very often anymore! Forever a John Mayer fan! Keep it comin'!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am really hooked on Downton Abbey.  The characters are diverse and interesting.  There are a few characters I love and a few I love to hate!  The story lines keep you interested in knowing what will happen next.  There is never a dull moment!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had to see what all the hype was about. Poorly written, faux erotica, completely predictable once you get into the mindset, ( if you want to go there.)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Someone recommended this series to me. It's amazing how fast you become interested in the tale. I find myself wanting to visit the Abbey so I can see what it looks like in person. The characters have depth and the story is intriguing.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I absolutely love the story. I have the music I went to the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it and now I have the DVD. It's a story that you can watch and never tire. To me it's money worth spending
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you liked &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;, you will like this movie.  Addition to the fantasy world of JRR Tolkein.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I turned off every light in my home then walked around using only this flashlight app could not believe how bright it was. I mean it's as good as any flashlight I own. I can see using it when fumbling around for car keys or house keys late at night. It really is useful and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|Say what you want about this movie, I LOVED it. The first time I saw this, I watched it again back to back. Wish there was a part two :-(
0385349947|5.0|This book is so inspirational and freeing at the same time! This is a must read for any career-minded woman.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Okay, here's the real deal:<br />This is a fictional tale that took place in a actual place and time. If I were to tell a story about Roman soldiers I would not have them speaking like somone from the 21th century.<br />My point is, enjoy the movie because the dialect is accurate for the target era. This is a great story with great acting, action, and direction.<br />Enjoy!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|cheap and fast. nuff said. and movie was really entertaining, would recommend to anyone. especially those who are bourne fans
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great fun. Highly addictive. Love being able to play with my Facebook friends. Love to compete and get that very high score!
B004J0PUP2|5.0|Amazon, fix this -- the version you guys have up freezes every time I tried to play it!!! Why this movie???
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I use it regularly. Given the nature of a tablet, I  am searching for an app the reads handwritten notes.  This is helping me get by until I remember to get a stylus and find a handwriting app. Very intuitive and easy to read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I am not familiar with bi-polar-ism, so I couldn't relate that much to the way the main character describes his adventures. Maybe the author wrote the book in such a simple and repetitive language to reflect the ups and downs of a disturbed mind, but maybe it is just his style (and, if that's the case, I find it too best-seller-y). Very easy to read and quite entertaining.
1400069807|5.0|This book is such an eye-opener!  I always knew giant food factories were only concerned with profit, but didn't realize how deeply they research ways to manipulate us to continue to purchase their junk!  AND didn't realize how deeply the government which is &#34;supposed&#34; to protect us from fraud is in their pockets!<br /><br />After getting angry, it isn't so hard to resist sweet, salty, or fatty &#34;so-called treats&#34;!<br /><br />This book isn't easy reading, it is painful to learn thru the author's well researched findings just what the USA is really like!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game and I love the characters and all but getting them is hard when you want the limited time one that cost a lot of coins, you either have to pay real money \\"and a lot\\" or play non stop for 12 days
B005K17RU0|3.0|This was a awesome app for me for years but I made the mistake of updating the app!  Now I really don't care for it. Deleted it and reinstalled it with hopes of getting original format but no luck '
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Great got to watched several movies while waiting at traffic court...now just need to download more to watch.. loved that was easy to rewind when i needed to do it when people asked me question.  No streaming errors at all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is much better than another version of Solitare I previously used.  It's a good way to occupy my brain while watching the evening news, Wheel of Fortune, or Yankee baseball games.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This is easily the most effective, engaging animated DC flick I've seen. From the animation, to the art, to the voice cast, and the ability to weave the best parts from the cinematic Batman universe into this crime drama. It is absolute class, and bests anything before it. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of the original animated series. But due to the direct-to-DVD release, and rating -- creative liberties were given that were not afforded to the animated series. It could easily be a companion piece to The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Batman is not Superman. He needs to flirt with crime drama, psychological thrillers, and film noir. That is quintessential Batman, in my opinion. When his comic book gimmickry is downplayed, and you can treat him as though he were a police detective, as opposed to a dude flying around in a bat suit. It's almost as if all that (cars, weapons, costume) becomes window dressing, or a facade to lure kids to throw down money as opposed to the real crux of the character who is Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />Many things in this film are treated with care, and respect. More so than other Batman fare. And maybe it's my naivety in regards to the comics this is based on, but \\"AMAZO\\" is the only flaw. After the film does a killer job at setting a somber, Batman-esque tone -- AMAZO happens. A ridiculous, cybernetic, super solider is thrown way out of left field to attack Batman, and Nightwing.<br /><br />Imagine you're watching a show like \\"The Sopranos\\", and after a great bit of storytelling, and setting the \\"rules\\" of the show -- you're comfortable with the tone. Then WHAM, Tony Soprano gets hit by a lead pipe, and he is face-to-face with no one other than Swamp Thing who wants his crib back. But Tony, and his family are turning his mossy home into a waterfront cantina for drunken tourists that moonlights as a money-laundering scheme.<br /><br />Doesn't make any sense, does it? The Batman universe is definitely broad, and has many supernatural elements (including the Pit featured here.) But does this particular film, focusing on the crime-driven narrative, and ideological battle between the Red Hood, and Batman really prosper from the robot with the elfin shoes? It's distracting.<br /><br />But no matter, AMAZO's done in like 3 minutes, and you have the rest of the film to enjoy the incredible cast, art, animation, score, and storytelling that sets this apart from any other DC animated film. Five stars, highly recommended.
B00263HWM8|5.0|We watched the 3 MI's three nights in a row & really enjoyed them. On the edge of your seat, though some of us found III predictable (still excellent!). Youngest viewer was just shy of 15 & we thought OK. Would definitely like to see another come out.
B000025Y9I|5.0|Now this is one of my favs. I love the title track and it keeps my attention throughout. Loved it!
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|It keeps asking me for what I know to be a valid e-mail address and password. It also asks me to enter the security letters. I do that without success. I have tried and tried. Insanity!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This movie is blood and guts and white men running into a black mans bullets. Not much acting lots of blood.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who had asked for it. He likes to set it up with some of his other Legos and has enjoyed it immensely.  The parts look really small to me, but he says they are what he wanted...
