B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I think this game is very fun,very addictive and the graphics are amazing so if you are thinking of getting it I think that's a great idea and the best part about it is its free.. buy this then go take care of those zombies.

B0006VBFM0|5.0|recomendado a mi novia le encanto buen regalo. recomendado. . . . . . . . . . . . .
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Watched the entire movie waiting for something to happen. Very odd film that lacked any meaning. This phenomenal line up of stars are individually great at doing something in this film, but entirely there is little connection between the characters. As it turns out in the end, the entire script was meaningless. It bugs me that I went to the trouble to rent it, let alone that I watched the whole movie - thinking the whole time \\"okay, something will happen\\"... One word. Nothing.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|As sad as Pat' s story is, his quirkiness and mentally off balance perception of things made me laugh and kept me wanting to read what would come next. His character is very lovable even though he describes himself as not being able to get close to anyone but Nikki. He loves his family despite the fact they´re dysfunctional. Sometimes during the book, Pat was a bit too quirky to seem realistic, especially given how intelligent his character is. Overall, great book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The end probably didn't happen the way the movie depicts, but it made for an nailbiting watch. Good job, Affleck.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I liked what I saw of it but it keeps kicking me off, and I lose the last 5 minutes of playing! ! frustrating!  hopeful. its fixed!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Kind of drug out, focuses entirely too much on the &#34;heroine&#34; (should we really call her that?). The ending, I was expecting a slam dunk entry into the compound, instead it seemed like it took hours to break into the place, and people just lined to be shot.
0062238868|5.0|This is a well written book and one that I've recommended to many friends. I've heard nothing but good reviews from everyone.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Daniel Craig, bless his heart, does not convince me he is James Bond. He's more like a Bourne type guy. They need to return the franchise back to where it belongs.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really got into the all characters.  Great acting.  The writing was outstanding.  I really enjoyed every minute of it.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Most part of the movie is focused on what's happening inside CIA rather than operation, For a movie, visual efforts and re-construction of events are very important, it is missing. Information about the operation is missing like how they gathered additional info the house, inmates, preparation of Navy seals for the operation etc.<br />In fact Wikipedia has lot more information. I could have read Wiki.. instead of watching movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really loved the characters.  I loved the era. Great story.  The acting was superb!  Can't wait till next season.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you're reading this, you've probably already read the Hunger Games and Catching Fire and enjoyed thm. If you've heard rumors that Mockingjay isn't as good as either of them, it's true. But then again, those are high standards to live up to. Mockingjay has a very, very slow start, and not nearly as much adventure or romance as the first to, but I like it anyways. It opens up with Katniss in the midst of what is likely post traumatic stress disorder. She is grumpy and gloomy, which makes it difficult to read, but the ending is so worth it. Unlike the other books which invovle lots of action and doing, Mockingjay is more about the feelings that come along as a result of everything these charcters have experienced. It is complicated, depressing, and beautiful. I normally am an incredibly voracious reader, but after Mockingjay I had  to wait 4 weeks before reading anything else, I was so caught up in the feelings of this book. I don't normally cry at movies or books, but I did multiple times during this book. If you can suffer through the first half, you will be greatly rewarded by Suzanne Collins's genius ending.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Simple yet addicting, as most good games are. including offline and unlinked play features is nice for those who travel or don't want to connect to a social network.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Found it difficult to stay focused.  Too many slow times.  Cound't stay engaged.  Mostly just wants to know the final outcome of the relationship.  Mostly being nosy is what's keeping me reading.  Still I am ordering the 3rd book and will go see the movie when it comes out.  Because reading is not my favoirite thing, that might be why I feel this way.  I need action, action, action to stay focused.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I saw it at the movies and just had to buy it, what an amazing story, I used to own the original vinyl of Cold Fact,<br />The man is a legend,<br />Highly Recommended.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|this cd was wonderful, as are all of his recordings. just love his music! please notify me of more of his cd's
B008OHV5QO|5.0|What can you say about Neil Young other than Amazing, Thrasher, Powderfinger, Four Strong Winds, Heart of Gold, Old Man, plus so many more too numerous to mention.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Entertaining but nothing great. Get this movie at red box not worth renting for $5 on here, but definitely worth a buck.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, it was quite easy to read, and I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|An inside look at the goings-on in the political system in England.  The story lines and acting are brilliant.  Ian Richardson is beyond great...if you like political intrigue, this is for you.  Much better than the Netflix American production of House of Cards with Kevin Spacey.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was really easy to read and it constantly kept my attention.  I would recommend this book to others.
B008JTK9NW|5.0|I own several P.O.D. recordings and this one holds up to the previous releases. As long as P.O.D. continues to have releases such as this one, I will remain a big fan.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Did not want to put it down. I liked the twist and turns in the story. I will recomend this to my book club.
B000N6UERK|5.0|This movie was thoroughly enjoyable!  Without any hesitation or reservation whatsoever, I would (and have) recommended it to my friends.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Kept me intrigued for most of the book but lost me toward the end. It became a bit unreal at the end.
0790729709|5.0|This is a great movie with our dear departed Whitney Houston and of course the handsome Kevin Costner.  Thank you.
B006Z2XTBY|2.0|William Boyd is an amazing writer from the inside out, but in this novel it seemed to me that he was listening to his outer voices - e.i. Okay, write your next novel, hurry hurry hurry.<br />Boyd has an extraordinary command of the language and of the voices of his characters, but in Ordinary Thunderstorms I think he came up with an idea (a lot of little thunderstorms gathering into one HUMUNGOUS climax), chose a bunch of characters to fill the role of thunderstorm, and then put them to work to create his climax. I was so distracted by jumping from one character to another, chapter by chapter, that I was never able to feel anything for any of them. Each seemed extremely stupid in his own little way. Why would a professional person (the heart of the novel) relinquish logic for fear? Why not just march into the local constabulary, Bud, and explain yourself. Why would a professional killer focus on the very person who is taking the heat away from him? These questions go on and on.<br />I could not read past p. 75 (hardcover edition).<br />I love Boyd's writing style. But this time, style wasn't enough.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show and enjoy reading about the family on whom it is loosely based. Waiting for the next season!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son and I like strategy games.  We play a LOT of risk and have enjoyed stratego a bit.  This game was a lot of fun for us and a guest can be right in the game after a trial run.  I wouldn't do without it on the shelf ever again.  It's a game closet staple from here on out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle for use wherever I may be. It seems to be as accurate as any other similar app.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I gave this a four because I looked forward to reading it. However, when I started it I couldn't stop comparing it to Scott Turow's &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34;. The main character was a Presecuting Attorney, he had a buffoon in his office. and his wife was difficult. I knew something strange was going to happen but I wan't sure what. I would recommend it to anyone who liked courtroom dramas or mysteries. Not as good as Presumed Innocent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I downloaded this app for use when I am traveling and don't have access to a TV. I feel confident that TWC information is reliable.
B008602KQI|5.0|i love this movie.. i dont have to be renting it to see it..and love that it had the code
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an app for my Kindle that doesn't get used often, but it is there when I need it.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I was kind of disappointed with this movie by the famous director. One reason should go to the Amazon stream because there was no caption to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't use this app on my Kindle much, but enjoy it when I do. I especially like using it for recipes when my phone screen is just too small.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|What can I say? The Bible is the Bible, the most read and published book of all time. A must to have available on my Kindle.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting is superb and the storyline just pulls you in.  You can't wait to see the next episode.  I love it!!
0670026638|5.0|Dear reader,<br /><br />I am just a little envious of you, of your not having read 'A Tale For The Time Being' yet, of what is in store for you between the pages of this book.<br /><br />It is such a rare experience to encounter a book that is both entertaining and enlightening, one that engages you on the level of a good story that is written well, but also opens you up, allows you a glimpse of how you really see the world. This book is like taking a walk with a trusted friend. You listen to her tell you a story--she makes you laugh, she may even make you cry--but your real experience is of her empathy for you: you realize she knows just what it is to be striving to be an awake human being. Sure this book is about the characters, Nao, Jiko, Ruth, Oliver, and it's settings, Tokyo and Cortez Island and these people and places are beautifully and heart-wrenchingly rendered, but this book is also on a deeper level about the experience of being a reader, about the deep and moving conversation that a great book really is.<br /><br />I could not put it down and when I finished it I could not wait to read it again. There is so much in this book to savor, just the memory of it makes me teary, makes me shake my head, makes me bow with upraised arms in deepest admiration and gratitude.<br /><br />Your fellow book-lover
075669910X|5.0|To go back billions of years and consider the vast seas covering a very different Earth and witness in the text and pictures the emergence of life, the wholesale destruction of much of it, then the re-birth of a new kingdom of plants and animals, time after time, to end at the extremely short period that Mankind is here makes for an awesome experience, which you will have  when you work your way through this book.  The book has been put together by many people, and the editor has done a magnificent job of unifying the presentation.<br />A major catastrophy will certainly happen, brought upon us by our own misbehaviour or by an external event, wiping out most of living beings. In another one hundred million years the Kingdom of life will be back in full glory on our planet. Whether we will be part of it is in our own little hands. Get this book and read it. It will help you to make up your mind about your own lifestyle.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This has it all; it's edgy, strange, gory, and just well done overall. I can't wait to see season 2.

1616550414|5.0|A really awesome book full of a lot of the art from the series. It tries to tie all the stories together into a whole, which is really cool.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great look at the politics of the time and of Lincolns struggle with the slavery issue and the 13 Amendment.
B001IBIQU6|2.0|...it's very sweet and flavorful at first listen but as time goes on you start feeling weighed down and bored with it's shoddy production and distracting noises.  I've loved every Depeche Mode album from Ultra and earlier and continually hoped for a return to form but sadly this is not such a moment.  I am happy to report that at least their latest album, Delta Machine, is a much more welcome return than this album ever will be.  There is at least one pretty decent gem in \\"Wrong\\" from this album but not much else worthwhile.  I'm as hardcore DM as the next guy but there's no way in hell this is a 4 star DM album.  Fanboys are skewing reality.
085786078X|5.0|Loved Simon's cat 3  because it had great & very funny cartoons & the addition of little teddy olny made it even funnier
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I won't be shy about my absolute distaste for Exciter, Playing The Angel and Sounds of The Universe.  Hell,I liked Speak & Spell more than I liked those albums and it always kind of irked me when the fanboys would claim Mode could do no wrong.  They certainly could (and did) with those albums.  Delta Machine, however, is a much welcome step in the right direction.  The production and mixing is much more layered and improved than those previous albums.  (I will credit Flood more than Hillier for that one)  Feels like everything clicks with this album and there's a genuine sense of emotion that isn't cut short by the blips, bleeps and crunches of those previous efforts.  Martin and Dave sound really good after all this time and it feels like a more natural sense of artistic progression for the band.  They usually say their upcoming albums will sound like Violator or SoFaD and it's usually not the case but I will say this one actually does sound like those with a dose of Ultra mixed in.  There are some minor lulls here & there but not enough to weigh down the overall album.  The lyrical content is surprisingly strong as well - and that is saying something considering how good DM's lyrics usually are.  I will finally have a DM album on repeat that isn't from Songs of Faith and Devotion or earlier.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love this thing so much I've bought several. I keep one at home, one in a travel kit, one in my office, etc. I gave a few out as gifts too. The V sharpeners together put a terrific edge on all of my knives - just use the carbide sharpener first and then the finer ceramic, just like the instructions tell you. If a blade has a serious flaw, I use the more aggressive diamond stick to straighten it first and then true it up with the V sharpeners. The only thing I'd add is you have to be sure to pull the blade straight through the V sharpeners, otherwise you will not get that razor edge. I love being able to say \\"be careful, that's a very sharp blade\\" when I let a friend use my knives and this little, inexpensive device enables me to say that.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read the other four first, and this one is more of a great thing! One note - it is parallel in time to book four.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I watched Sandberg's TedTalk a couple of years ago at a work function and it generated some provocative discussions.  &#34;Lean In&#34; builds upon the messages and themes from Sandberg's speech about the importance of female leadership in our society and how women (and men) can do more to achieve equality in the workforce.
B00936A0RU|5.0|My husband and I really liked this movie, although I was a bit surprised by the amount of violence in it.  The story is really good though and you can't beat Tom Hardy and Shia Leboeuf!
1476733953|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book, yet was highly disturbed by it during the entire time I read it. As all good science fiction novels accomplish, the story ends up not being about the science fiction -- the science fiction plays an important, but ultimately secondary role to the character development.  Good science fiction novels, IMO, develop fascinating characters who grow and change in their relationship to the science fiction background they find themselves in.  Well worth the time and effort to read, you will not be disappointed.
B005LAII8A|5.0|My husband and I saw this in the theater and knew we'd buy it once it came out on DVD.  Great sci-fi movie to add to our collection!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just got it and it is a blast!! I love having this game. But my brother keeps taking the kindle fire away. So it is good or better if my brother would stop.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid and couldn't pass up the chance to get it so my young nieces could see it too!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|Overall, the game was easy to learn and not as frustrating to control as other platform games I have tried.  That said, after a dozen levels, I still felt like I was doing the same exact thing over and over again.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I'm still digesting it all; the story, the truth, the learning, the adventure.  What a wonderful tale. Brightness shines through the characters and their growth.  Simply wonderful.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I downloaded this app after playing World of Goo on the computer.  It's a good physics-based puzzle game that offers hours of play time.  The levels are varied enough that it never becomes boring, and the graphics are pretty good.
B005NPCUC8|4.0|Well, I finally bought a copy of &#34;The Dark Side of the Moon&#34;.  It cost $2.99 and I could  not resist.  This is an excellent album, Pink Floyd at their peak.  However, I think their masterpiece is &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34;.  I like &#34;The Wall&#34;, &#34;Animals&#34;, and &#34;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&#34; better than this album.  My reservations about this album, hinge on one thing:  I have heard it way too much over the last 40 years. It was on the charts for over 20 years (I think) and it was played constantly.  From smoked filled friend's bedrooms to the heavy rotation on classic rock stations, it was and is everywhere.  As a whole piece, it is great and I enjoyed listening to it.  It's just not as good as many of their other albums.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Worked perfectly although the case was broken.  This didn't effect the playback but makes it difficult to store the DVD set.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather station I have ever bought.  The last system I purchased had to be replace 3 time in the first year...gave up and bought this weather station.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So much space and its a upgrade from the bag I use to carry. now I dont have to worry about it slipping while walking and picture talking.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A GREAT INSPIRATIONAL READ; EVEN FOR THE NON RUNNERS. GOOD MOTIVATIONAL TOOL FOR BOTH THE YOUNG AND THE OLD. MADE ME WANT TO REDISCOVER MY \\"get up and go\\"!
159420411X|4.0|requires some knowledge of statistics and math theory. the proposed idea of the bayesian theory appropo to the thesis. maybe decrease the total number of different topics..
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A most unusual book that reveals deep human emotions that we humans have to deal with.  I recommend it for anyone who has loved and lost someone.
B0086700CM|4.0|This was the first game AP I downloaded to my tablet. It took me several hours of play and some conversation to accept that the runner doesn't actually get anywhere. I have problems holding the game level to keep running on narrow paths.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I use this as I am studying for my Extra Class HAM radio license. It works for all my needs.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It works well for reading on my Pandigital Supernova 2.3.  It is slow to load when I start up and difficult to &#34;Manage my Kindle&#34; with. I handle  most of my kindle managing on my Deck top.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like to use this when I'm away from the computer. Nice tool for getting your Email quickly on the fly.
B000FA675C|5.0|I already owned the paperback. I wanted a copy for my Kindle. I am a big fan of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon Novels
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This movie has incredible visual effects and the soundtrack is awesome! We highly suggest buying both. The movie is even cooler in 3D so if you can swing it, buy the whole combo pack. One of our favorites!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Contemplating moving made me want to hide under the bed but by asking myself some of the questions posed in this book.........I realized that less stuff would make the move (and my life) easier.  Then I tried just clearing a few surfaces around the house and realized that Francine was right!  I actually FELT lighter......she is really onto something!
B009X00E18|4.0|I liked this cover, I was sort of  looking for a case that closed. This is a very protective cover.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Read this book for book club. Expected more trail description, less obvious soul searching. Five of us in club didn't care for the book, one loved it!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This was a present for my wife. She is a Jimmy Hendricks fan from way back when. She loves this CD.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This latest version of the Bourne series is worth owning and watching because there are so many subtle details and such an abundance of fast action that most viewers may not take it all in on the first viewing.  Giving me the right amount of tension and action without overdoing it, yet concluding on a positive note, left me wanting to see the next movie in the series.  I also enjoyed the back-room extra features showing how some of the movie's special effects were done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Be carefull if you watch this, you just won`t be able to stop!  I started with season one and had watched them all in three days.  Interesting characters, twist and turns, and just makes you want to see what happens next!  Looking forward to new season on PBS.  Must say you should reallstart from season one, you will really know the character's.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Classic John Grisham.  Intricate, clever plot.  Outstanding creativity and originality.  Characters colorful and realistic.  Fast paced and no words wasted.  Short of a classic, but a great read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this game should be 5 star rated. So I'm going to help TeamLava get their game to be 5 star. Your welcome.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|I am a non-traditional college student, I am studying to be a high school math teacher, therefore, I am having to take a lot of math classes.  This App has been a lifesaver!  Totally the best tool in my bag right now.  Thanks!!!
B009C7JS14|3.0|I found a better one.  After examining this program did not suit my needs.  Found a different program that had features I liked more
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Long, but extremely worth the time. Great insight on a very creative individual.Well written, lots of detail, an inside look at what drove this somewhat different man.
B002XXNSF6|3.0|The story is fairly simple and does not stray from the basic premise of two strangers meeting on a train and deciding to spend some time together, eventually developing feelings towards one another in a short span of time. There is a lot of dialogue which allows us to get to know each character at the same they get to know one another, which I think was a good choice. There aren't any surprises however, and the narrative is easy to predict on some levels. There's also no conflict between the characters, and I found that to be unrealistic; there was ample opportunity to introduce stronger elements of conflict which was not pursued. This is a good, solid film. The actors are engaging, and have good chemistry which ultimately is what makes this film work.
B00181MHQU|4.0|A total classic. I definitely recommend at least renting to watch this flick once. Natalie Wood remains stunning and timeless.
B0045XICB2|3.0|I hate movies about Werewolves and Vampires. For me those things were played out decades ago. these movies were obviously aimed at young teenaged girls which I am not.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend in the USA. I live in Europe.<br />We , in Europe, are waiting for the DVD The Complete Series 5 ,to come out in PAL frequency and it will be available on June 3rd. at Amazon.co.uk.! Looking forward to it.<br /><br />It is an outstanding series. Excellent actors, unusually well thought- out script not even spoiled by the crudity of the material and<br />background.  The &#34;hero&#34;  & his partner rise like &#34;a phoenixes out of the ashes&#34;, just when we think all is lost for them.<br /><br />The ethical dilemma: &#34;Does the end justify the means?&#34;. . . is glossed over and  is there & important! However, the story is still outstanding!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is a vary good book and I look forward to reading the next book even though my friend already spoiled it.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; season was a gift for a friend. I naturally also gave them The Complete First Season first! as a present.<br />Why share this crude, &#34;low-life&#34; theme?<br />This series is so expertedly put together!  It is difficult to analyse WHY given the subject matter,is so good.<br />I can mention several factors that may have &#34;hooked&#34; me to such an unlikely series, with such &#34;low-life&#34; subject matter!<br />I wanted to share this series.<br />The &#34;hero&#34; was a lawbreaker with a capital &#34;L&#34; , yet, he had his own sort of integrity and values or agenda which he put<br />as a higher priority to the &#34;LAW&#34;! namely . . . the survival of his family after his death! His genius ideas for Chemistry had been stolen from him by a so-called friend and &#34;society&#34; was rewarding this &#34;friend&#34; while HE with his unappreciated gifted intelligence was being treated as a slave by society . . . the same society. . . that backs up the &#34;LAW&#34;! The world is pretty absurd anyway and<br />this situation about the hero and his priorities becomes understandable. We can´t help but sympathize with him on his dangerous<br />quest to make millions of &#34;big Bucks&#34;  out of a potentially lethal situation! He is doing it for altruistic reasons. He is very unselfish.<br />Bryan Cranston with his understated personality portrayal is very good casting. The other actresses and actors are really well<br />cast. The situations are bizarre yet believable and convincing.<br />Bryan Cranston´s role was like a mouse trying to get the cheese from the trap and not get hurt. He had to outsmart so many<br />people we are sure he will fail! Just when things look most bleak for him a tiny little triumph due to his own intelligent and calm<br />reasoning help him out of the impossible situation and we breath a sigh of relief!<br />Everyone needs him and wants him to be perfect! Who is perfect? No one not even the Chemistry teacher. Another sigh of relief<br />for the audience.<br />He keeps his mouth shut and forgets his own ego when most would be tempted to talk about themselves. We have to admire<br />this trait.<br />The roles of all the players were so well and realistically portrayed. There was a lot to enjoy about this series. I am really looking<br />forward to when the fifth series comes out on DVD in PAL frequency as that is my frequency.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This case is good for everyday use.  It doesn't protect like an Otterbox but it works fine for careful iPhone users.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Seven sections with 30 levels in each section!<br /><br />As dictated by my 10 year old: It's fun and I like the boss battles.  There are monkeys that can hop onto to things.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Works perfect with my Nexus 4 to connect to my HDMI display with audio support. Best feature is it charges the phone while connected.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|It works well, and shifts to portrait easily.  The slats hold Kindle in portrait nicely, no problem of falling out.  I wish the cover had a place for the stylus.  I have to put mine down in the fold of the inside cover so it works well when closed with the elastic holder.
B008PWN0I4|5.0|Using it to stream music from my ipod classic to my bluetooth monster speakers. Works well and doesn't consume too much power allowing hours of music from my ipod on the go.
B004KPC22U|5.0|The movie was excellent in that the voices closely matched the characters. The music was also fabulous and brought a better connection to another county's translation of lyrics.
B002IPG400|5.0|I never met a Jane Austen I didn't like, and reading Emma on Kindle means I can pick it up on my smart phone, my iPad or my PC anywhere I have a few minutes, and they all sync to the same page!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's like Mario in 3D. Kids will love it. Adults too. Free & great. Fast paced. Character upgrades. Hover board. Get it you'll be addicted.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|i like the game alot inalsonreally like the graphics thatnit has. And i also like how you can choose the controls. And it is really good.
0385344228|5.0|This book still haunts me. The character evolution is incredible. The ending still has me me shaking my head in disbelief and it was totally believable. Very pertinent to today's issues. A great novel, but also an eye opener for anyone with children. Loved, loved, loved this book.  Total page-turner. Couldn't put it down.
B004T340QY|5.0|Classic movie with a plot that will keep you laughing the whole time. The characters and scenarios that the gang find themselves in are hilarious.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Amazing true story of what men are capable of doing. Well written and gives real insight of the horrors of wars.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Has some action and some interesting spots throughout the movie but this is not one of his better movies. Nonetheless it was a good movie to watch and stay entertained.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the production.  Big fan of British TV. The cast is marvelous.  The scenery makes you want to take a trip over the pond.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Such an awesome book. Can't thank the author enough for all of his encouragement. Definitely sharing this with all of my loved ones.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Another great action story with an ending that comes out of nowhere. Baldacci spinning a wild tale at his best.
0312020309|5.0|Wonderful as all his books were. People don't realize how much of a people-person a veterinarian has to be treating farm animals or pets  and how important they are for the safety of our food source
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is so much fun! Its like monopoly but better. Its monopoly with trading, and building settlements and stealing resource cards! Instead of money you use resources to build and trade and the bored isnt so one directional. Personally ive always found monopoly kind of boring but I cant think of a better comparison. Once you get bored of this original version you can also buy packs that let you try different variations on the original. The original is for 4 players, but you can buy the expansion that makes it for 6, and if you buy the variations you have to get the expansion for the variations as well. Totally worth it, me and my friends love playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If it is a little to much money get the game because it is the best APP EVER I<br />Ever seen
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twist and turns. Well written. Not sure how I feel about the ending. I highly recommend the book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Of 8 of us 7 liked it and one didn't read it. We thought it was a fun book. What adventures and misadventures. I personally found this to be tedious reading in some spots. Going over the same material again and again. But all in all it was a good read.Thank you Mr. Jonasson.
0553386794|1.0|The good: This book is interesting because we all know that real people played a very real game of thrones. It seems to me like the Discovery Channel would be very well served making a documentary about various characters like Henry V, who pretty much conquered France with a relatively tiny army using both incredible military and political gifts.<br /><br />The bad: There are so many I don't even know where to begin. The series starts off by introducing us to far too many main characters via far too many points of view. Fine, I can accept that. Throughout this process, the Starks rise to the top as the central characters of the book even while other single characters might seem more important than any one of the Starks individually. The Lannisters are introduced to the reader as the enemies of the Starks. The Lannisters do bad things to the Starks and the plot thickens.<br /><br />As time goes on, nothing advances in the central plot the first book setup. So where the plot of the book starts off pitting Lannister against Stark, that evolves into being NOT the central plot in the series. Meanwhile, nothing gets resolved. Does Jaime get killed? No. Does Cercy get killed? No. Does Joffrey get killed? No. We're not asking for the series to end with total victory for the Starks, we're asking for SOME resolution to issues that author himself creates. Sadly, there is no climax or resolution in each book. Each book reads like nothing more than chapters of a ridiculously long single book.<br /><br />In the end, you have nothing more than a soap opera set in a medieval fantasy world. This series is nothing more than that and much like a soap opera, the central plot if and where there is one advances at a snail's pace. The series becomes a meandering stream of consciousness writing exercise that you wish started off that way so as not to draw you in to begin with.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi has always refused to be constrained by semantic boundaries, and his music continues to defy categorisation; however, both pop and classical camps can and do argue that he is or isn't in their particular tent. To the listener this is of no consequence: flick that button and such considerations dissipate under the ensuing emotional tide which is simply *music*.<br /><br />A gifted young composer, Einuadi became a pupil of the great Luciano Berio and it was Berio who freed him from the idea that pop and classical should never meet; the scores to films ensued, and as his music spread so did his increasing popularity.<br /><br />In a Time Lapse - as in previous albums - features the piano prominently, though here the music gradually grows out into rich orchestral sonorities; this feels like an entirely natural living process, as the colours transform, out of stasis and into bloom. Always though the piano underpins the advancement and again and again we return to that calm and inner sanctum which is Einaudi's own voice: those gossamer-like piano chords.<br /><br />I Virtuosi Italiani are joined by violinist Daniel Hope [[ASIN:B00BPB7Z3I Spheres - Einaudi, Glass, Nyman, P&auml;rt, Richter]], augmented at times by synthesisers and electronica for what is a mesmeric and at times hypnotic journey.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm reading her other 2 books now.  Great new capable wriiter takes the reader right into the story without a miss step.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|It works great, but broke on my second use of it...for the price, can't complain. Really easy to use and carry.
B007EDZ20O|4.0|Well documented & written, an easy insightful read. paper tigers exposed<br />Well documented & written, an easy insightful read. paper tigers exposed
B00BF123WG|5.0|Really explains the background about how Bin Laden was found.  I also think it is super that is was a woman!  Kept my interest from start to finish.  Highly recommend it, very good movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app. I think it is the best app I have!!! I wish all apps worked ad well.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is wonderful to have on my Kindle HD!  I have it on my computer and I use it ALL the time.  I was very pleased to see there was a version for my Kindle.  Super easy to use and very necessary for reading material!
B000F9RB8K|5.0|excellent condition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it on my computer and I love it on my Kindle!  I like how easy it is to play on my kindle too.  This is a must or anyone who likes to play Solitaire on their computer.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is addictive and fun. its been awhile since ive played the real coin dozer game from the carnivals and fairs. brings back fun memories
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|I liked the Broadway show so much that decided to watch the original movie. Everything you see in the movie is in the show except t the new songs composed for the Broadway production.<br /><br />The most important thing about Kinky Boots is it's message.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to learn/play.  Too many easy aces.  Far too many dupicates on original deal.  Have not tried multiple player option.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|I've been a fan of this Movie/Musical and enjoy listening to the songs every once in a while. The first 10 minutes of the movie are my favorites.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|3.5 Stars.<br /><br />There were so many wonderful things about this book, that I highly recommend it. I would suggest if you get the expanded version with footnotes, whether it is a dead tree or an e-book, DO go to the footnotes DURING the reading, rather than afterward. I believe it will significantly enhance your visit to the 1940s.<br /><br />The style of this novel, entirely written in the form of letters from one character to another, was an interesting device, but without any interceding narrative, made it a much harder read.<br /><br />Here are some of the top reasons I liked this book:<br />1.  I loved the story, the slow delving into what life was like for these island people during the German occupation.<br />2.  This was deeply, richly researched, and the details were fed in so smoothly it never felt like a big info dump.<br />3.  I liked that nobody was demonized. There was a German doctor who was not The Devil, and a Guernsey busybody who wasn't A Saint.<br />4.  I loved Kit teaching her special friends how to lisp.<br /><br />Things that were problematic:<br />1.  I found it very hard to get a grasp on who the main character was, and what she wanted until well into the book.<br />2.  For me the characters on Guernsey were extremely difficult to differentiate in the beginning. I didn't even realize Dawsey was a grown man until further in. His letters to me suggested the style of an adolescent girl, and I skimmed right over the salutation.<br />3.  It didn't seem that Juliet, our lead character, once she was on the island, had any real difficulties. She was able to get the material for a book, blow off her unwanted lover, and adopt the child she fell in love with.<br /><br />Overall, i liked it and would recommend it, but it's not the easiest read, because of the author's style choice.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the game is ok if u just.like running and jumping. personally I don't see the point in this game. I wouldn't waste your time on this game.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|There is not a whole lot to say about this movie except it is worth the money. Being a college student I enjoy all the references and Disney I usually really good about making awesome movies!!! I highly recommend this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have followed John since 2007 as a nerdfighter and have read all of his novels. I preordered this book and completed it the day it came out. I have re-read this book seven times and will re-read it more. I wish to find my own Augustus one day. I keep re-reading to fall in love with him again. I have not shared this book with anyone, since favorite books are special like that, however being a top seller makes that a tad useless. I am not happy about this book being a movie because with fame comes misuse and people who don't read books and see the movie to find out what it's about. With the movie will come more nerd fighters who aren't nerd fighters and it will make me sad. Truly yours, Anna.
B00005ATZT|4.0|Unfortunately, it has its fair share of language (!) which I can do without, but it's a good movie.  Harrison Ford has quality.  It's a good story.  No bad sexual stuff and a minimum of violence.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The writing is spectacular for this film.  It is an incredible story with some religious underlying.<br /><br />We saw this in 3D at the theaters when it first came out.  It's still a great movie even watching it now.<br /><br />The plot is laid out very well.  It doesn't have much of a hook in the beginning though - so expect a little slow at first.  However, the exposition and back story of Pi's life now and then is very good - especially how he got his name.  Each character has very good traits.  Because it's mostly about Pi, I like how the movie gives just enough exposition of his family to better understand him.<br /><br />This is a movie you have to pay attention to because the ending ties together some things and has a bit of a twist.<br /><br />Definitely worth the buy.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I am sorry, but C.S. Lewis is awesome, it's just that I am very sensitive to anything that has any kind of witch type of element in it, or anything that parallels occultic stuff, so I put the book away after starting to read.  Not that it doesn't compel you to read - it does, because he is such a good writer.  See, I am involved in healing a deliverance, so I deal with the demonic, so I am very careful with things that might have that element.  I am not saying I don't recommend it at all.  I definitely think this is the perfect alternative to Harry Potter.
B004LUS390|5.0|I love using this for quick sketching, being bored and drawing, jotting down sketch ideas before drawing, and just generally messing around with it.<br /><br />Once you learn how to quickly switch between the menus to get the tool you want, it's very easy and fluid.  A better way of saving your work would be nice.  It reminds me of what Photoshop should be for Android.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Because of this man, I have begun a whole new lifestyle, a whole new diet - and have lost 17 pounds.  It has led me on to other gurus of diet who are similar in philosophy - Mark Sisson, Atkins, Jordan Rubin and there is a term I have learned to describe this diet - the Paleo diet.  It is healthy, it does all sorts of things.  It improves bowel movement health, it increases physical strength, it increases immunity ( like wow! ) it causes one to lose weight (but don't be discouraged if it's slow).  I got started reading this, and doing the diet because of my co-worker.  All of a sudden she started dropping the pounds like I couldn't believe!  I look at food in a whole new way.  I understand better what is truly healthy now.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I downloaded this game while on vacation, but now play it whenever. I have to wait between appointments,  meetings, etc because you can get in and out of it easily and come back to it right where you left off. Also, rewards are frequent so I play it with my 3 year old grandchildren (twins) who probably enjoy it more than I do!<br />Joanne R.
1616550414|5.0|bought for several people as gifts. as Zelda fans, they totally love it and months later, are still excited about it
034580404X|5.0|This is an awesome read. I highly recommend it to everyone. I cannot wait until Miss James writes a follow up. It is worth every penny.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|This book will make you frustrated, angry, and sad -- but only because it's so well-written. If you are interested in development and/or African history and/or globalization, this is an excellent book to read!
B000FC0V3E|1.0|It is difficult to find signs of fine literature in this book of Hemingway. The sun has not risen here.
B004OR199G|4.0|I learned so much from this book. The only reason I don't love it is because the diet is Vegan. I do understand the harmfulness of eating red meat all the time, but i think that organic chicken and fish can be part of a healthy cancer, heart disease, and diabetes free diet.<br /><br />I am all about being gluten free. The effects gluten has on your body is traitorous and Kris does a good job explaining this and so much more.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good read.  Did not see the ending coming.  Fun to follow the story's logic.  J. Teacher continues to a like able character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a GREAT game! Well planned out. Great graphics! Fun for all ages. My twin 8 year old's love it as much as I do!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is a great show for kids and adults. Its great for kids because it teaches a valuable lesson about not being afraid of your fears. And the cast is great, Hugh Jackman as the &#34;Easter Kangaroo&#34; is hilarious. Great show highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great App with quick access to my locations. Able to set my preference for outdoor fitness but, despite my input, it continues to state &quot;poor time for fitness&quot; regardless of conditions.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Incredible album.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It took me a little while to figure out the operation, but once I did It seems to be okay.  I haven't used it much yet.  I especially like that when you enter a search you are provided alot of options to choose from.
B00886XQO0|1.0|I purchased these for my gaming PC.  After about 5 minutes they power themselves off with an annoying \\"Ear Force Tango Powering Off\\"  Sometimes they run for hours at a time.  Some nights I can't get them to stay on at all.  I will be returning them tomorrow.  Back to my Logitechs.  The surround sound effect wasn't amazing, but they were very comfortable and had average sound quality.  I would have kept them...had they stayed on.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|5 Stars. Great plot, intrigue and an ending you don't see coming. Once again Nelson keeps you guessing with anticipation
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|so many levels to this movie. It had action, love, desperation, and hope all rolled up into one great movie
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro but couldnt connect it to my corporate network because we dont have wifi.  Looked at amazon for USB 3 network adapters and this one came up.  Read some of the reviews and decided to purchase.<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Goto [...]  Download the latest drivers to the Surface.  Install them.  Plug in the adapter.  You could use the CD that comes with it and pull the drivers off of there but  found the website to be easier with the surface.  Plus you get the latest version.<br /><br />The adapter hasnt let me down yet.  I dont have any performance metrics but its a USB 3.0 network adapter so performance should be the most critical thing when deciding on purchase.  I would definetly buy this product again if I need another one.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I know that the techniques used were avant garde, but the mediocre singing was a distraction from what is otherwise a fantastic story.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|When I tried to upload I received a message when uploading &#34;File Corrupt.&#34; Was unable to view product therefore hate it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|One of my favorite shows ever.  All around well done. My wife can't take all the violence however, so not for the lighthearted.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was something.  It was great , and erotic.  But then the stupid end pissed me off . It was soo not cool -_-
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My niece who is 5 loves this game.  Actually she has played Temple Run like a pro and now is begging me to get Brave.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|This cd has version of telling ghosts. VERY GREAT AND A MUST HAVE FOR ANY PUSCIFER OR TOOL FAN. LOVE THE CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My niece who is 5 years old and is very much in love with this game.  I would say she is a pro at it along with my 17 year old daughter.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good read, and also something that's very original. I like the settings and look forward to reading more peculiar adventures
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I love Michael Jackson.  I love the album. I am sure more songs by him will be apeparing on my kindle.
B00699SDR8|5.0|Would it be possible to outline to outline the great philosophers of the century in a novel that you actually captured your attention and made you think. Yes Yes and this is it.
0316286850|5.0|Very satisfied with this purchase.  The best book for makeup ideas. Shipped fast. I will good use out of it.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|I'm in my 50's and enjoy a very broad range of music, and gave Anastasis a try for my first DCD album.  The blend of vocals and instrumentals is very enjoyable.  I particularly enjoy the first track &#34;Children of the Sun&#34; with its mix of vocal and the horns, the second track &#34;Anabasis&#34;, and the 7th track &#34;Return of the She-King&#34;.  Can't say how this compares to the group's other, somewhat distant albums, but this is a winner.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Easy to read. It takes you through the lives of this guy and his family and friends from a very humane and compassionate point of view.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|First let me say, my wife very commonly falls asleep in the evening as we watch a movie.  That didn't happen on this film.  It was captivating and not predictable.  Well worth the watch.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|excellent characters and plot.....excellent venue  there is nothing more to say and the word requirement you have imposed is an imposition on my time.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|This series gets better every time you view it. I first watched it on the BBC website, but it was eminently better once it was on HBO and I could really see it clearly and hear it. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is subtle and powerful; he portrays myriad emotions by simply moving his lower lip. Rebecca Hall as Sylvia, his wife, infuriates and inspires at the same time. The comment on social classes and war is a fantastic layer to the already beautiful love story.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|great movie that never seems to lose its way, nor is it slow paced.<br />Still has a long way to go till it is over . Would not be surprised if it comes in 3 parts.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|enjoyed this movie, has depth to it.<br />the beginning of this movie presents you with symbols of  mythology of &#34; Once and Future King&#34; The poem by Tennyson is powerful. As the symbols of old bond such as the car Bond pulls out of storage which made me smile........very much.<br />Clearly Bond has to carry the day, not new fangled technology....as shown how he gets the bad guy in the end.<br /><br />Enjoy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good read....can keep you busy for hours lost in the story and what's to come....xxx can't wait to start the next book
0062082353|5.0|Insightful look into the life of one of America's heros. God Bless our Marines, Sailors, Soldiers, Coasties, and airmen.  God Bless their families.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this website and the pinning feature much more than I thought I would.  It's really useful for a variety of project ideas.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|My comments regarding &#34;Coming From Reality&#34; cover this album as well.  Though I can't yet rank him with the best folk singers of all time, he certainly deserved more attention than he got back in his prime!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|&#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is arguably the best sci-fi movie to come out of the 1950's and maybe one of the best ever.
B00005OAE6|4.0|Though he's no Springsteen, at his best, he was a pretty good spokesperson for the working class perspective.  And I do feel that this album and &#34;Night Moves&#34; were Bob at his best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing subway surfers because of the coins and I spank the police which makes him go away faster.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I spent the first 23 years of my life in Detroit and had never heard of this guy.  Apparently, I'm not the only one.<br /><br />As a result of &#34;Searchng For Sugar Man&#34;, I've begun listening to this album and its precursor &#34;Cold Fact&#34;.  So far, I can't honestly say Sixto Rodriguez ranks up there with the best of the poets of his era, but he's certainly better than a lot of artists who made it far bigger than he did!<br /><br />Most great folk songs (and this is definitely urban folk) don't bowl one over on the first listening.  These songs kind of seep slowly in and are certainly worth repeated listenings.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is an amazing book if I had to discribe it in one word it would b  infinate :) you'll have to read the book to understand what I mean. :)
B008JFUTT0|4.0|As I mentioned in my review of his 2 albums, &#34;Cold Fact&#34; and &#34;Coming From Reality&#34;, Sixto Rodriquez came as quite a surprise to me.  Having spent the first 2 decades of my life in Detroit, it's rather sad that I'd never heard of him.  But then, from what we see in this documentary, it's a wonder anyone got to hear his music at all.  It's particularly amazing that he was, quite unknown to himself, such an esteemed poet half a world away!<br /><br />Imagine how many artists (of all modes) have simmered in life-long anonymity.  At least Rodriguez didn't have to wait to be posthumously appreciated.
B006P0FICE|5.0|I grew up watching the Disney version and enjoyed it. This remake was definitely an improvement with unique spins throughout and talented actors that bring new life to the characters. Definitely satisfied with this buy.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beatrix Potter's life story is a sweet and inspiring one.  She became an author and illustrator at a time when women were not considered suitable to be so.  She followed her heart and her conscience in living the life that she's lived.  In doing so, she has found creative fulfillment and fulfilled an unexpected destiny.  That being said, I shall stop here in order not to give away the plot of the story.<br /><br />I hope that helps.  Happiness!
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple years ago and I remembered it recently. Had to buy it. This movie was clever, creative, and had some great comic timing. Cast was talented and the story is worth seeing multiple times, so I consider it &#34;buy worthy.&#34;
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game to play I have enjoyed playing it is very addictive I recommend it to everyone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Enjoy the game very much.I had no problems loading it.I would recommend this game for everyone who loves horses.great all the way around.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The story line makes you not want to stop reading. I don't think I ever was bored at any point.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Stunning in scope and structure.  Amazing characters shine in a story that leaves you wanting so much more.  Truly epic.  Can not wait for the next installment.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Very much enjoyed the book.  Very easy to read and have been recommending it.  About to read it for second time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does everything I need from an alarm app. Simple to use, but fully featured.,  You shouldn't be disappointed. Definitely worth the download!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I liked the differences from the film and this book. . It was enlightening and more fun than the movie.
0061714402|5.0|I want to start out by saying, I do not own a single album by Megadeth.  I know who they are, I am very familiar with Dave Mustaine, but Megadeth was too fast/heavy for me, so I never really listened to their music.  That said, I still enjoyed every bit of this honest, thorough, and compelling biography.  I like biographies, but I am very put off when the writer isn't honest, or has learned nothing from their life experiences.  I'm pleased to say that Dave was very honest, and though he may not have many regrets, he certainly gained wisdom and insight as he went through his life.  I found him to be interesting, a great writer (assuming he contributed heavily in addition to his co-writer) and though a very intense and sometimes over confident person, not unlikeable.  He acknowledged the things he did wrong, as well as explaining his view at the time.  The whole Metallica insight was fascinating.  I didn't realize how much it affected him and always will.  I was moved to tears in the last chapters, as he finally overcame his addiction and found his spiritual place, and his role as a father.  I thoroughly recommend this book if you are a fan of Megadeth, OR a fan of rock/metal, OR just a fan of biographies! Great job, Dave!
159315724X|5.0|Daren reminds us all we need is the every day small step and we can accomplish just about anything. I can't believe how much I've accomplished just since I read his book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great acting, have you wanting to shake the main character, thats how good it is Denzel washington at his best.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|THIS GAME IS FAR MORE SUPERIOR THEN OTHER GAMES AND ITS FREE. It sucks u can't attack on your own though bet it is still fun
B0060MYM3S|5.0|season two is excellent. just saw first episode of season three. am so excited. the show is great. will definitly buy season three
B004UJ81IA|5.0|First, I'm biased:  RLS is someone I connect with.  He is able to create a mood and very companionable spirit when he writes of his travels that I find hard to define but which I return to year after year.  I can tell you that I am THERE with him as I read and that even after a few pages, I feel as though I am travelling with a friend.  If you've read Treasure Island and felt a connection with the main character, Jack Hawkins, then you'll get some idea of what you'll feel when you read Travels with a Donkey.  But don't squandor this book, this experience.  If you know you may have illness or anxious times in the future, this is a book to save for those times... or to come back to.  I hope you love it as much as I do.<br />  And if you would like to augment your experience, I'd suggest also reading Richard Holmes' Footsteps: Adventures of a Romantic Biographer (Apr 30, 1996) wherein he traces RLS' footsteps as well as fills in some supplementary bio info on RLS that enhances Travels.
B004SEUJBE|5.0|Very good quality of sound and pictures, like the movie<br />would recommend to purchase , and enjoy it many more viewing
1423140605|5.0|I know that a fourth book (\\"The House of Hades\\") in this series will be released later in the year, but this one is the best so far. The dialogue is more contrived than in the first two books, but the suspense is better too. The chapter that has Hazel and Leo caught in a flashback sequence is one of the highlights. I can't wait to discover what the Mark of Athena actually is. Nicely done, Rick Riordan. My high school students love your books.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was reluctant to download this app from reading all the bad reviews, but I looked at the number of 5 star to 1 star ratings. But anyway, Facebook works flawlessly on the 1st Generation Kindle Fire. Transitions are smooth and content loads in a timely manner. I'm very satisfied with the Facebook client, instead of the web browser one.

B005HSL626|1.0|grandkids down loaded this when my grand kids were here.  I did not play, just watched and am not interested.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I listen to this a lot.  especially after seeing the present movie .  Been a fan of Les Mis'erables for a long time .I even have the casset version in French.
B0086700CM|1.0|I have absolutely no idea what this &#34;game&#34; is all about.  I do not play it, my grandchildren wanted it.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is excellent for its price and packs a lot of features. I switched from a Logitech G500 to this mouse because I went though three Logitechs over two years, and they all ended up with the same problem where they double clicked when I single clicked.<br /><br />The mouse settings are easy to configure, and in the settings you can completely turn acceleration off for maximum control in games, something you couldn't do with the G500. However, this mouse has many more smooth and plasticky parts than the G500. In fact, the only part that is rubberized and has substantial grip is the thumb area. The rest of the parts where you place your hand is smooth on this mouse, whereas they were grippy on the G500. However, this mouse is actually a little bit more comfortable to hold and use than the G500 now that I have gotten used to it, though it is cheaper feeling and smaller. The cost is much cheaper too, so that's OK.<br /><br />I miss the hyperscroll feature of my G500, though this mouse's scroll wheel isn't horrible. Only the Anker logo's colors are changable, and the side button closest to the wrist is right underneath my thumb with my hand position, and I sometimes accidentally click on it. Despite these little things, the software is great and I am making use of most of the features of this mice; they aren't all gimmicks.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I highly recommend this mouse.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I haven't heard some of these songs in years.  Nothing like the good old days.  The duets with the other artist are great.  Thank you,
B009A9SULS|3.0|I gotta admit I'm a gadget freak. I love technology. I got this ereader as a specific use device, mostly as an ereader to go in my briefcase to work. I have kindles but those are for at home. I've had about every model of Kindle there is.<br /><br />This Kobo Mini is a tiny ereader, I am forced to compare it to the Nook Simple Touch and Kindle.<br /><br />The display on the Mini is very close in quality and appearance to the 2nd gen white Kindle with 5-way button. It has a silvery gray background and has a similar quality of text display. Not too bad really, but watch out for the price you pay. It's not worth anywhere near the value of any Nook or Kindle.<br /><br />This unit has touch screen to turn pages, highlight words, and work the menu system. Sometimes the touch feature seems a little slow to process, sometimes. The screen is small, so the buttons on menus are small, so fat fingers like mine often send you to the wrong place. Luckily this is not a huge problem, nor is this the only device with this problem for me (iphone too).<br /><br />It should hold a few hundred books with it's available memory.<br /><br />There is no sound capability whatsoever.<br /><br />There is a game or two built-in and a tiny web browser that actually seems more responsive than the one in most Kindles I have used, especially faster than my Kindle DX (which has about a one minute lag time between touch and response when online).<br /><br />With virtually no buttons (except slide power) it is easy to grip and not accidentally turn pages. The text display is configurable in many ways (size, spacing, font, etc.) There's a built-in dictionary which might only work on books you get from kobo?<br /><br />It displays many formats of ebooks, much more than the kindle. The biggest difference in size between the kindle and kobo mini with regard to the screen is the kobo is much shorter vertically and a little narrower. The kobo is also much lighter weight than the Paperwhite.<br /><br />It's so small, it is almost hard to hold and read when laying in bed. It actually seems to take two hands to use, one to hold the other to swipe page turns. Since it is so light weight it is hard to swipe the screen without moving the ereader physically.<br /><br />It has a large white plastic frame that feels cheap but sturdy. My nook color creaked and bent with a simple gentle grip of the hand. The mini feels solid but wimpy. There is a gap between the eink display and frame which will surely eventually trap lint and dust and be impossible to remove.<br /><br />For a connector/charging, it's the same as the Kindle. Comes with the cable but not the charger. You can charge it from almost any USB charger (or computer) with the same connector.<br /><br />If you're into free ebooks, the kobos are a nice choice because they support lots of formats of ebooks. You can find lots freebies, without DRM (a computer code inserted into the ebook which makes it so the distributor can control your use of the book and revoke it's use at any time, and restrict which device you read it on). See sites for lots of free ebooks like Smashwords, Kobo, Feedbooks, Project Gutenberg, Craphound and others.<br /><br />Summary: this is not a suitable replacement for the Kindle or Nook but close. More versatile than the competitors. Easy to carry. Shop around for the best price because many stores sell this for far more than it's worth.so small, it is almost hard to hold and read when laying in bed.

0739341243|5.0|occasionally stirs off course but for the most part, well-researched (especially the neurophysiology section) and insightful.  I have recommended it to a number of friends who are either introverts or has children that are.  also, i thought the reader did a very good job.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|Ok, so this one was very different. I was entertained just from the pure pleasure of something I hadn't seen before and it wasn't overdone. Using children to be the story was a nice touch. I liked it. It's not all gory, but there are parts that might be distressful to some. Just a light warning, it's a horror movie so what do you expect. I appreciated the twists on beliefs and how they were used in the movie was really good.
1905492073|5.0|Really easy to follow and written for the &#34;every man&#34;, not just scientific types. Highly recommended for technical divers to be.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|I'm not sure where to begin. This took a very strange twist and kept going. I was fascinated by the whole &#34;plot&#34; of the movie, even though there really isn't one. It's disappointing in some ways to watch a really good role be cut short. They may have thought that it would be an &#34;unexpected twist&#34;, which it wasn't. You would have to like the strange and obscure to enjoy this. I liked it just because of how it was played out with the characters. It's pretty intense and murder is the goal. I think it needed a little more realistic to make it more than just okay. Two women who kill. Nothing new there, but how and why is the &#34;different&#34; part.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you like sword and sorcery then this excellent easy to get hooked on. * * * * * *
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am hooked on this game. I have been neglecting my reading to play it, mean while I have dozens of books floating in my cloud WAITING to be read.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I had high hopes for this book because I love dystopian series, but this boom had too many super natural elements that turned me off. I did enjoy the perspective of the book and liked learning more about the setting along with the narrator.<br />This book was well written, just not for my taste.
B009CG96QM|5.0|Had not seen the movie in a few years and wanted to watch badly. Should have waited to get amazon prime then I could stream all day. But worth it
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this for my Vmoda LP headphones to give it an extra boost when listening to my music through my ipod/iphone/macbook/car speakers. My music taste ranges from Danny Brown to Purity Ring to The Story so Far to Algernon Cadwallader to Bon Iver to Fleet Foxes to Freelance Whales to Defeater to Being as an Ocean so I needed something to cover all the genres I listen to from bass heavy to light music with wide soundscapes and the E6 doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />For hip-hop music it totally changed my headphones. With the EQ with the Blue light my head shook along with the kick drum beats. Listening to less bass heavy music like folk I think it's best to leave it in the first mode without the EQ light on and you can hear details in the music you didn't hear before, every little tambourine shake shines and you can feel all the layers in the music.<br /><br />The EQ with the red light adds a slight bass boost, but it really makes the mids and highs super muddy, I don't recommend this setting for anything unless you're listening to something with harsh treble I guess.<br /><br />It does have an achilles heel though.<br /><br />Listening to all my music, it brings everything. All the imperfections. I spent an hour messing with my internal EQ on my macbook trying to balance the mids and highs with the bass because they did get slightly muddy and all my mp3 files started to sound like poop. I don't want to fill my macbook memory with flac files because I work with big photo files for work.<br /><br />If you have a terabyte to spare I would get all flac files to get the best out of the amp or you'll be stuck with mediocre sounding mp3s.<br /><br />Other than that I think this is a great $30 investment if you love music.<br /><br />Also, don't try and use this as a direct headphone input for your record player, it sounds horrible. Just go to a pawn shop and buy a decent amp in case you're trying to use this for that reason. (I was curious don't judge me.)<br /><br />Anyways brb downloading all my favorite albums in flac.ays brb downloading all my favorite albums in flac.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|This has been a great series to watch. I like the way they have tied in details from the movie storylines into this project. Good entertainment and great way to have long conversations about &#34;what if&#34; scenarios.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is so much fun!  lots of interesting mini games!  well worth the money spent!  tecommend for yous of fun!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I fell in love with Cheryl and the book. Becoming a human being is no easy task. How could someone so young be so wise.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|As a fan of this Bond, I love this movie and the visual quality its amazing. I recomend this movie anyone.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I just wanted an alarm to wake me up-this is perfect-select time and it's done. It even has a snooze button!
6304107218|5.0|Easy transaction, quick delivery, great movie. Two thumbs up.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward sounds just like he did 40 years ago when the Moody Blues began. This is a wonderful collection of music by him which includes a variety of music from ballads to blue grass to techno. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The majority of the movie is centered around the conflict of the wife and husband.  The aggressiveness of the arguments gets a little uncomfortable.  There are some light moments that will make you laugh but the yelling and screaming between the husband and wife take up the majority of the movie.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Paul Rudd is likable and funny as usual<br />Paul's buddies have some funny scenes<br />Melissa McCarthy has some funny lines.<br />Megan Fox is extremely good looking and she plays a promiscuous character.  Great bra and bikini scenes.  Kudos to the director for taking advantage of this.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Leslie Mann is just brutal to deal with as a movie viewer.  Her voice is like fingernails on a chalk board.  I just want her to go away in literally every scene.  She has that crazy look on her face that reminds me of Julie Hagarty from Airplane.  Not pleasant.  However she has a nice figure and they play it up a bit.<br />Melissa McCarthy was under utilized.  She is hilarious but she is only in a couple of scenes and she is pretty tame in those.<br /><br />Overall:<br />We wanted to watch a fun romantic comedy.  This was more of a downer than anything.  It has a happy ending but it doesn't qualify as a light and fun movie.
B00C1E8E7E|5.0|I think Tyler's production has really improved since 'Bastard' (his first album). His lyrical ability has also improved. The collaborations on this album is another highlight as well.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|What an electric CD.  I like every song on the CD. I am so glad I used my Amazon Birthday Gift certificate for this great CD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series EVER, can't wait for next season to start already. If you aren't already watching these series, you need to start now.
B008FIHUDO|5.0|Was a great blues, raspy voice.  I love listening to it LOUD.  Great music which will make your bounce around the house!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|very fun and quick to learn. throwing birds at pigs what's not to love about this title. other then everytime you think your done they release a new version
B00A7L00XE|5.0|How can you go wrong with Charlie Musselwhite and Ben Harper.  Nice collection of songs.  I have been listening to this for weeks and am not tired of the songs.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|amazing show, very gritty and real. makes other shows look pathethic and sad. the character and story are very evolving every episode
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|Great collection of songs, recording is wonderful, and I love listening to this CD in the house and in the car!  First class.
B00BTHV05M|3.0|Older album were much better.  Maybe the group is experimenting with new sounds.  Tempo is too slow for my taste.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Beautifully produced and recorded CD.  Norah has such a wonderful sexy voice.  This is my second CD of hers and I love it.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't wait to get back to it once I had to put it down.  I enjoyed all the different Character's narratives.<br /><br />If you plan to watch the movie after reading the book, maybe wait a few months.  The book was too fresh in my mind and I really lost a lot of enjoyment of the movie.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I love John Hiatt.  This is a wonderfully produced CD, I love the songs and it is great listening in the car and at home.  Good Stuff.
0307279189|4.0|This book was a great read. It was recommended by a work colleague and once I picked it up, it was hard to put down.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I normally do not like Girl Voices but Adele is a KEEPER!  What an amazing, talanted, emotional singer.  She will be around for years.  I LOVE this CD.  I rank her with Janis Joplin!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard great things, so I was looking forward to the book. While I enjoyed the surprises the story has, some I expected from the tone of the chapter, I never liked the characters to care &#34;whodunit.&#34; I also don't like the ending. I won't spoil it, but after everything - everything, I'd have liked something else.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|What can I say Van Morrison just keeps pumping out great music.  I am glad he had NO Plan B.  He is a great performer.
0062012339|5.0|I am going to a Crue concert in May and thought it would be fun to read up on stories from their hey day!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I like most of the authors books and this was no exception.  kept me interested right up to the end.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Huge star wars fan, while I don't agree with what they're doing as far as changing the movies, the seller doesn't have anything to do with that. Good Family Fun!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown captivates you on this riveting journey through our nation's capital! Really enjoyed the historical references and details about some of our most renowned monuments.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The &#34;REAL&#34; Star Wars saga. Huge star wars fan, while I don't agree with what they're doing as far as changing the movies, the seller doesn't have anything to do with that. Good Family Fun! Arrived quickly as promised.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is unique in its approach to its topic, childhood cancer. No sparkly skin or moving eyed mortals. Just good writing without the cliches.
B00BF11STU|5.0|If you like military/action type movies, WITH lots of included drama, and a great plot, this is an awesome movie. Jessica Chastain is a very good actress, and everyone else did a great job.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Jo Jo writes a story that is similar to what I struggle with when it is time to put down a pet because their quality of life has failed.  This book really makes you think about human rights and is a great written story.  This is a must read.  Can't wait to discuss this with my friends at our book club meeting.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|This is a late review ( my apologize ) but: still was an excellent purchase, a quickly shipping process and a very good price. I will recommended. Thanks a lot!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The first one was so fun and this one is even better. The graphics seem to be improved and no glitches. You can even play multiplayer. You can play as different characters and new awesome powers. If you liked the first one, there is no doubt that you should get this one as well. Enjoy!!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a late review ( my apologize ) but: still was an excellent purchase, a quickly shipping process and a very good price. I will recommended. Thanks a lot!
B009O2XY12|4.0|Enjoy seeing if I can get all bubbles popped.  Need to purchase more bubbles to extend to next step.  A real mind expander.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|So glad I took the time to read it. It was different from the movie but good none the less!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good thing this so big bigger than my head about 3 times to exact. The best book in the world.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|It's a DVD, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first, but at the time they were selling the whole trilogy for $5 so I figured I would give it a shot. I was curious what all the hype was about. But when I started reading, I could soon tell. I found myself wanting to read more and more just to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the writing style. It was very easy to get into, and hard to put down.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It's a DVD, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it. Very informative.

B000002U82|4.0|It's a CD, what does one say about a product like this. I wanted one and I now have it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I found this book utterly entertaining. It has great characters and storyline. The plot grabbed you right from the start and I wouldn't have minded if the book had gone on for another 500 pages.  This story was not a disappointment on any level. In fact, instead of such a wrapped up epilogue (which I really did enjoy)  it would have been great to have had a sequel to this story.

B009IJJB8G|5.0|I prefer Elementary to any video version because to me Sherlock represents Sherlock from the novels( I have read  them all). I prefer Jane to John. If you have never read the books you should for pure enjoyment.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am finally happy that someone made a game that does not end. You get to add friends and explore different rooms.
B005USZML4|3.0|I am use to Grisham and a very indepth build up to a dramatic finish. This book did not have it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have both Android and iPad versions of the YouVersion Bible app.  Both versions are easy to use and work very well.  The 4-star rating is an expression of my appreciation for the availability of many translations at the touch of a button.  The audio feature, associated with many of the translations, is also a plus (less strain on the eyes and allows me to perform other tasks while listening).<br /><br />I have downloaded other Bible apps.  However, this one is my favorite.<br /><br />...I am still looking for the YouVersion Bible app that can be successfully downloaded to my Kindle reader.
0061733199|5.0|A must for doomsdayers, zombie fighters, or anyone who likes to camp, even. Would recommend if you're into survival tactics
0345473035|5.0|The book has great insight and information that is practical and works! We have had amazing success using the techniques.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this is the best alarm clock ever you can use your music already on your device. you can go to the store and pay $15-$20 on a alarm clock that cant play your music on. I give this a easy 5star app

B009AMANBA|1.0|My best friend bought this movie for $20. I'm so glad I didn't. I would have been angry for being ripped off:  The majority of the movie did NOT focus on the life of Lincoln, but instead the politics involved getting the Constitutional Amendment passed - which mirrored the same procedures going on with today's politics.  In fact there was very little insight on the LIFE of Lincoln; with that respect the movie is highly misleading.  The acting was okay - but not spectacular. And it dragged on and on which I found the movie boring-because it focused on getting a Bill passed to law. So nothing was gained by watching this movie; instead LOSING $20 of your hard earned cash.  If you want to be treated with a good movie on Lincoln, get \\"The Conspirator\\" directed by Robert Redford. That movie was great. You can get it on Amazon really reasonably priced.  But this \\"Lincoln\\" movie - it stinks and is BORING.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|The second book starts by drawing into the wilds n it's world. But then slowly it turns cheesy and at times trying to push things to happen. Usually when I like a book I really want to finish it to see what happens, but with this book I just wanted it to finish.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was sooo excited when I found this for the price!  I have started watching the series all over again & LOVE IT!!!!!
B00005S6K8|5.0|Made my mom very happy she loves this movie . Having Alzheimers it's a very comforting movie for her to watch
B0060Q962Q|5.0|i don't play a lot of games but i do like this one. it's very easy to use and very easy to play. No Complaints at all
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|It's the Beatles on vinyl. I would not be able to sleep without giving this 5 stars. I will certainly buy their next new album when it comes out! ;-D
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i don't use ths a lot but i do like this one on my Kindle. it's very easy to use and i have No Complaints at all
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic books. I would recommend them to anyone who loves to read!  Teens and adults alike will enjoy this trilogy.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Movie was great but resolution kept shifting between HD and standard and at some points would stop as if paused.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is &#34;awesome&#34; as James Bond, and this is another great movie! I am so thrilled that I can rent movies from Amazon and watch them in the comfort of my home. I am a huge Daniel Craig/James Bond fan!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|A fun film for all the family with family issues and independence and growth of the much loved child. Good light entertainment.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is more for Bond fans than anyone else. This is not one to start somebody off with watching. If you loved Casino Royal and didn't think Quantum of Solace was that bad this one is great. The struggles Craig goes through as Bond really speak to who he is as a character but it is not for those not intimately acquainted with the bond universe. Plus the ending will mean nothing to you without having seem some of the older flix. Remember, chronologically, this is the 3rd Bond movie in all the 007 franchise.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I've had this movie in VHS for years. One of my favorite Christmas, yes Christmas, not holiday, movies. Right up there with Christmas Story. Figured Blue Ray would make it even better and so it did!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Was unable to read at this time. Will have to check out again to compare to movie. I just want to return this book.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Imaginative look into a possible future.  Accurate description of how selfish and evi human beings have always been and how kind traits of kindness and courage can survive.
B008220D7S|5.0|This was my first time pre-ordering and i was so excited to get the movie at my door the first day it came out. I really enjoyed this movie.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|The talent of the kids are amazing but the show drug on, nothing reached out and grabbed me like the other shows. However, I do love to watch the dancing talents. Will never stop watching them!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Is it bad that I found some parts of the book funny? Anywho, I thought it was a great read. Definitely don't want to die by zombie apocolpse now. It was different than what I expected, but it was still good.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Acting from all superstars is phenomenal and story is engaging. Would recommend it for all people who love serious drama.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is such an amazing writer that he takes the reader to places, even uncomfortable ones, with such ease that you loose yourself in the story from page one.  His trilogy is one of the best out there.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this for computer, PS3 and kindle...so I must really like it, but for the kindle there is no mini-games, no zen garden, and no chocolate loving Snail!!!! (I loved that little guy). so if PopCap would UPDATE, the game would be complete. It is worth the $0.99 it is now...but I paid $2.99 for it...so I'd like to get my moneys worth, right now I only have $0.99 of it. UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE and if you didn't hear me U.P.D.A.T.E.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00271HAK8|5.0|Movie never gets old.  Had to go open a bag of gummi bears after the final credits.  Love this movie.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The drama continues between Matthew and Mary. Will they ever finally get together or will events finally pull them forever apart? Stay tuned. And that opaque Mrs. O'Brien, just what goes on in that head of hers, anyway? She's clearly got her own agenda, but just what is it? Julian Fellowes writing continues to weave this large cast of characters through each others lives.
B0098460O4|4.0|I bought this only because I heard one of their songs. This is a wonderful CD and a great choice of songs. So good for newcomers and I look forward to more of their music. Very enjoyable and good product!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three is the best yet, in my opinion.  Births, deaths and big changes in the world effect everyone in Downton Abbey.  Really a wonderful show!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this. The extras on it was great to watch. My son and I had a great time watching it. I can't wait until I get season 2 in to have a marathon!
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|This is an excellent show that provides a much needed filler between Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. The cast is very talented and the storyline is well-written. I would highly recommend this show!
B005IQZB14|4.0|It was a very entertaining read while I was on vacation. Well written enough to keep me turning the pages until the last page.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Ok, first off - I think after seeing this, that it's still up in the air whether or not Deckard is a replicant or not. Personally, I still think he's not - and the additional material in the &#34;unicorn sequence* doesn't make me think any differently. It's nice that they cleaned up the scene with Abdul the snake man. It's still an amazing movie.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Not much advantage over the charging cable.  It is useful when traveling for storing the headset in luggage or computer bag.
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|We are fans of the trilogy and looked forward to this movie but it plodded along so slowly my 9 year old son and I fell asleep.  Would that there were an abridged version, and we didn't have to sit through two more movies for Smaug.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I will look for other works by this author (Paulo Coelho).  He weaves a tale with unpredictable happenings but a satisfying ending.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|When I watched Season 2 on TV I know I had to have Season 1. What a great series!!! I loved it till the end. Can't wait for a new Season to come on TV.
B005SV9W4Q|5.0|i love all the remix and are so catchy and i love to dance so this is perfect don't regret buying!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My daughter loved it and I loved the old school video game references!  Disney hit a home run with this film!
B009UNH0EM|4.0|It works as it it designed to work.  Good to have an extra for travelling for plugging in to the laptop.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Entertaining, more of the same but the same is good.  13 yr old daughter and 9 yr old son enjoyed it as much if not more than the first one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Prior to seeing the movie, it was imperative to read the book, a thought-provoking consideration of the art of storytelling.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Love Woody as he tries to energize his love life. Great chemistry with Diane Keaton. Not to be missed by Woody Allen fans - and even those who don't like his more recent movies will be entertained by this flick.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|i love the pictures and i got it for a steal i am a gaga collector so i just had to have this duhh! but the pictures are really clear and love gaga!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|No matter how much I knew about the Presidents and the history of our country , I knew much less of their relationships with each other--the depth, the complexities, the often behind the scenes helpfulness. I learned so much and found Gibbs and Duffy to be informative writers who made the President's, their times and their challenges come alive. I was eager for what would be happening next in the Club. I listened to it and have friends who either listened to it or read it and we were all similarly mesmerized.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|My favorite film of the year! You leave the cinema feeling positive after having had lots of laughs!  Don't pass it up!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The movie was very intriguing yet interesting and held the attention of 4 adults the whole time.<br />Great filming and action.
B001BRAUYM|4.0|It's still a good movie, but there wasn't that much added to it, just a bit of conversation that didn't reveal that much.  The Chronicles of Riddick director's cut was almost a whole new movie so I think that got my hopes up.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Its good to see Craig  show Bonds' human side.<br />  Very sorry to loose Judi Dench, She was the best M of all.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie is back with a amazing album the fly over his music repertoire, all with new crisp songs,<br />You must have it.
0671799320|5.0|Yergin lays out the history of Oil and how it's shaped our domestic and foreign policy for the last century. And for 900+ pages it's a concise, account of how important Oil is to our civilization, how dependent we are on oil as a &#34;cheap&#34; energy source. It's a great book. There are criticism of Yergin's point of view, but read this before you read any other book on oil. It's a great primer.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|My review is the five stars I gave it. Nuff said on that topic considering I don't get paid for my opinion.
B0012FHGCW|1.0|This started out way too slow, looked awful.  second time i tried to watch it, due to good reviews, but it was too boring.
B001CJJWV6|5.0|Really great DVD - long awaited in our house!<br />It arrived very fast and we couldn't wait to watch it! Buy it!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|a couple months ago i purchased this movie and i would like to say i really,really,really,really enjoyed it.even i used to watch PeterPan when i was a little kid but i still enjoy it at my age today.i also think this is one of Walt Disney's greatest classics today.so anyone who watched this movie growing up and wants to see it all over again i say buy it.chrisfan.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Interesting album, if you are newbie on Depeche Mode, I will recommend that you start with Violator, Song of Faith and Devotion. That way you can understand how the group has evolved in the last 30 years.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|A fast read. Similar to the show (which comes after, of course). It's interesting to see the differences between the two. Can't wait to read more!
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I was told this book was excellent but I had difficulty reading<br />about such an arrogant and cruel man.  It was well written;<br />however, the subject, Mr. Jobs, was not a man of virtue or<br />values.  Difficult reading about such a person.
B001NA6096|1.0|movie started slow and sort of dumb, too boring to finish it.  maybe should have tried longer, but I was bored.
B00AO686MY|4.0|For all of my childhood, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been one of my favorite movies.  Thankfully, it's another one of those movies that still holds up really well as an adult.<br /><br />1988 was quite a year for animation.  Out in Japan, Grave of the Fireflies, My Neighbor Totoro, and Akira were released in theaters and were all superbly animated films that in scales from good to masterful, delivered storylines and themes unheard of at the time.  Over in America, we were treated to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which gave audiences a hybrid of live-action film and animation that to this day, is unmatched in how sublime it is, which is also helped by its other strong qualities (more on that later).<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />It's 1947 in Los Angeles, and cartoons (known as \\"Toons\\" in this movie) aren't mere pictures on celluloid, but rather like real actors.  Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is an alcoholic private detective in LA, and after being paid by cartoonist R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) to take pictures of Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) playing patty cake with Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner), causing Jessica's husband, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to lose his mind.  Eddie soon gets tangled in a murder mystery after Marvin Acme was murdered, and must uncover the truth as to who really killed Acme.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />For the most part, the characters in this movie are done really well.  As an adult, I really appreciate the fact that Eddie is a troubled man struggling with booze because given the tragedy he had in the past (I won't spoil it for you), gives him a layer of realism.  Also, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is one of the creepiest villains from movies in my childhood, as he maintains a consistently menacing persona and does really cold-blooded things that can put Doom in the same league as the best horror icons.  Roger and Jessica Rabbit are great at providing solid humor, along with Doom's gang of cartoon weasels.  However, I wish characters like the bartender Dolores (Joanna Cassidy) had more time to develop.<br /><br />HUMOR<br /><br />The humor in this movie is really solid.  The humor is a perfect homage to the masterful slapstick and exaggerated bodily distortion of the classic Tex Avery and Looney Tunes cartoons.  One of the funniest things in this movie was when Eddie goes to the nightclub the night Acme gets killed, and the opening act is Daffy and Donald Duck in a piano battle.  Seeing these two iconic cartoon ducks engage in slapstick antics against each other was hilarious (especially when Donald fired a cannon at Daffy).  Another was when Eddie faces his fears about driving into Toontown, he dumps his glass flask of whiskey and using a cartoon gun that Yosemite Sam gave him some years back, fires a cartoon bullet that's a caricature of an American Indian, and the bullet uses a giant tomahawk to smash the flask.  Another is when Dolores catches Eddie in his office with Jessica with his pants down (literally), and she says to him \\"Are you dabbling in water colors, Eddie?\\"  There's plenty of other funny parts in this movie, but I think you get the picture.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />The cinematography for this movie is marvelous.  The set designs perfectly capture that 1940's noir feeling, and the designs of the cartoons perfectly fit the setting it takes place in.  The animation of the characters is totally fluid, and is even more impressive considering that the \\"interactions\\" with the cartoons and real people was seamless.  With this being made before the age of CGI, it's even more impressive to see all this and see the cartoon characters believably carry around real props like guns.  I think along with John Carpenter's The Thing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has some of the most remarkable special effects and visuals ever done in cinema.<br /><br />On a sidenote, the interior of the Acme gag factory looks a bit like something out of Tim Burton's imagination.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is near perfect.  Like the visuals, the music fits the setting of this movie like a glove, and one of my favorite pieces of music is near the end, when Eddie has a showdown with Judge Doom and his weasel minions, since it's so heart-pumping and memorable.  The original song \\"Why Don't You Do Right\\" is pretty catchy and is a great fit for the style of the movie.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />Even though this is a PG movie, there's some scenes that kids might not get or could scare them.  Some of the adult innuendo provided by Jessica Rabbit and even the weasels at times will probably fly over some kids' heads.  However, there's a really creepy scene near the beginning where Judge Doom demonstrates his brand of justice by grabbing a squeaking cartoon shoe and slowly kills it in a barrel full of a chemical cocktail made specifically to \\"kill\\" cartoons called \\"the dip.\\"  This scene scared me a lot when I was a little kid and even as an adult, still get creeped out by this scene.  Similarly, there's some parts near the end during Eddie's showdown with Doom that were creepy, but I won't mention these because I don't want to spoil anything big in relation to the movie's story.<br /><br />On another sidenote, it's funny to think that there's plenty of bad anime titles like Elfen Lied and Gantz that abuse bloody gore and dismemberment scenes ad nauseam to seem \\"creepy\\" yet the dark scenes in WFRR actually feel intimidating without using bloodshed.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is certainly a classic, and a really good homage to 1940's noir and of the Golden Age of Cartoons.  If you love the aforementioned things, you owe it to yourself to reserve a movie night for this live-action/cartoon hybrid gem.RACK<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score for this movie is near perfect.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book did a nice job of elucidating why (as a self-professed introvert) the modern workplace seems so distasteful. My hope is that many others will read Ms. Cain's work and realize how much productivity is wasted by catering only to extroverts.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed the reading.  May not be a book that avid reader's would like but for some one who has recently starting reading I found it entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love playing this game on my iPhone and now we have it on their kindles. I think it uses their creativity and find it to be a great game for them.

1400069742|5.0|Fantastic book about a subject I thought I knew a little about, but now realize just how little I knew. The great debate in this country over what to do about the rise of Nazi Germany, as well as the growing menace from Japan, is extremely well-documented by Lynne Olson. She lays out the course of events in such a way that I found the book very hard to put down. My opinions of both Roosevelt and Lindbergh have been forever altered. If you are any sort of a fan of history and politics, this is the book for you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a good game because you are making your own restaurant and trying to get to the last level. along the way you unlock anlot of levels and food.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I downloaded this app because I work long shifts,and when it's time for me to go to sleep I'm so wound up It makes it difficult. Now I just throw on &quot;White Noise&quot; and I'm good to go. I sleep longer and more sound because of it. It's a great app to have handy for those stress filled days.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my husband he loves it.  I would definitely recommend buying this set. The quality is wonderful
B009X01GJ2|3.0|I really like that it rotates especially cause not all the apps will auto rotate as well. The only issue is for some reason one of the corners will not stay snapped on though It stays in place because the others are secure.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I've been waiting for this game to come to the kindle and now it doesn't work right.I had to download it 3 times the first time it wouldnt login too fb and the 2nd time it just wouldn't let me play.I love the game it just needs to be fixed
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over, because the cinematography / direction / music is so amazing. Even when I know every line, I can watch it as I would a museum gallery. Gorgeous.<br /><br />The story is about young love on a grand, even epic scale. All the witty dialogue you've come to expect from Wes is in full force, but it is also deeply moving. When the credits rolled by the first time I watched it, I wanted to cry, laugh, cheer, and clap all at once.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Outstanding movie - follows book very well.  Hope the big D does the Silver Chair!! All C.S. Lewis books are well worth reading.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Fun little movie. Has some dead spots and a few scenes seem shoehorned in but overall a nice comedy with a good cast.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I would suggest this to anyone and everyone, it was well written, all I wanted to do was read it! If you need to escape, pick this book up and escape away, that's what I did! The love story is sweet, and completely genuine. I feel like this story is so unique it will connect with everyone who reads it differently, but that is what makes it so special.

B0071XO8RA|2.0|Wooden characters, stilted dialog, predictable plot.  Reads as if the author simply looked up &#34;science fiction dystopia&#34; tropes on a website, and then incorporated several into a story.  The biggest problem is the clumsy use of technology.  Time and again, the plot involves technological premises which are not only unlikely, but impossible.  The fact that water conducts electricity, for example, makes one of the crucial episodes of the book simply impossible to believe.  And a critical technical element is a video screen only inches from the face, which is supposed to produce a clear image.  Has not the author heard of presbyopia, virtually universal in anyone over 40?  The book was inexpensive enough, but it would be overpriced if Amazon were to give it away.  .
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Easy to download from the Amazon App Store. There was no cost for the app.  It is easy to use,
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was SO good. I felt I could connect with the characters and it made it special. I would recommend it to anyone and it is a great book to get away (if you know what I mean, that is what I did!) The storyline is so passionate and intriguing and the love story is sweet, but younger teens would not connect with it as much I would say. Enjoy and be ready to not put it down!
B001ULC3XU|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! This was the first Jane Austen book I read back in high school and I like to re-read it every so often. Thank you for having a digital copy!

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Very good. It was a little slow in the beginning but it pick up as it went on. Can't wait for the next one.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Fast paced and good human characters.  5 stars.  A fascinating setting. Fantasy at its best.  This system is ridiculous and I don't know how to put the stars.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I bought this as an e-book and am thrilled with it.  I am not a sci-fiction-y sort of reader but became interested in this book series after the first season Game of Thrones aired on HBO. Am now addicted....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|whoever doesn't like this game is stupid because this game is mixed with Star Wars and Anrgy Birds. So like it.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! Anything with Jane Austen I just get sucked into the book and have trouble stopping to do anything else. Thank you to whoever made this digital!
B00005YW4H|5.0|What a record. From the impeccable covers (cold cold heart, a hank williams classic, which Norah totally nails) to the hauntingly beautiful songs (nightingale, come away with me, long day is over, ...), served by super tasteful musicianship and this unique voice that could make you listen to the telephone book being sung, this record will ravish you and continue to grow on you for a long time. Yes it's it's sometimes a bit safe and sugary, yes it would be great to hear Norah letting her hair down a bit more, yes a few songs are nice rather than must have. But still, this is an important album, one that i keep returning to with undiminished delight and emotion, and that signs the emergence of a superb artist. Buy it, and use it. Yes Norah, we will come away with you. Anytime.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|My children play the games on our Kindle Fire.  They get so excited to come home from school every day just to see what the free app of the day is.

B000SEGMAU|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my Kindle. WOW! There were several parts of the book I couldn't keep myself from tearing up. What great insight to living a joyful and fulfilling life.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good variety of puzzles - including the free ones. I just wish there was more variety to the puzzle pieces for each puzzle.  The same jigsaw pattern is used for each puzzle.
0375850864|4.0|This book has won a ton of awards and it's easy to see why, with a concept so similar to the Madeleine L'Engle titles. If your middle schooler is interested in tales of urban living or time travel, give them this to read. A review is difficult to write without spoilers, but Miranda is chosen by a time traveler to assist him in saving \\"a life.\\" She doesn't really do it, but when the book ends she intends to because now she understands what he wanted. The plot does meander and the chapters are short and episodic so it did take me a while to get through it, yet I am a fan of this style of writing. Really liked it, didn't love it. Would have loved it if Miranda was a little deeper and I was allowed to know Marcus a little more--don't understand why, considering the role he plays.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Had expected closure to this epic in book five but there are still many unanswered questions.  Will have to wait for book six.

1451626657|3.0|...because I would never have to read another page of it again.  Catch 22 reminds me of Arrested Development, but it is nothing like Arrested Development.  The writing is clever and witty, I did not like how it was clever and witty.  Certain characters have a unique charm and appeal... I despised those characters.  Though there are a few chapters I did find to be interesting and enjoyable, I loathed them because there weren't enough of them.<br /><br />If the preceding paragraph annoyed you, then this probably isn't a book you will enjoy.  The whole book is basically written in this format.  Everything has a catch, paradox, contradiction etc. attached to it.  There are times where I thought it was clever and amusing, but it gets overly repetitive and a lot of them are really grasping at straws in my opinion, just for the sake of having some sort of contradiction attached, or forcibly attempting to be witty or humorous.  I found myself finishing the sentences before I read them knowing exactly what was about to be written a good portion of the time.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters, and chapters describing origins or more exclusive backgrounds of them all.  I really only cared for a few.  Some were extremely forgetful, or just downright annoying to read through, or just constantly repeating what's spoken to them and asking the same questions about 10x in a row.  Now I know this is a jab at the military way of thinking and it's logic, but it gets to be way over the top for me.  Nothing really seems to be in any order either, at least until you get to the last third of the book.  Then it becomes a bit more linear.  At least when I was bored with a section and sort of cruised through it on autopilot without absorbing what happened, I didn't feel the need to go back most times, as it probably didn't really matter.<br /><br />I was being serious though when I said it reminded me of Arrested Development.  I didn't mind the show, but I wouldn't care to see another episode.  But the characters and narrations are quite similar.  Most people in the story are eccentric, in some way intelligent but narrow minded, and cartoonish and a bit silly, or super innocent, or inherently corrupt.  Everyone is looney but sane in their own way. There were a few characters I did enjoy at times, and other passages about them that drove me nuts, so it was hard to grow attached to most.<br /><br />To be fair, I can't say this is a bad book, and there is a reason it's a classic.  It's definitely a work of art, I can appreciate what it must have taken to write this and develop it.  I feel I understand the underlying meanings, and agree with many of them, but it's just not the type of humor and writing that I enjoy.  So it was excruciating to read through certain sections because of it's repetitiveness and/or silliness in my eyes.  There were a few chapters I did enjoy...<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />basically the old Italian man arguing with Nately over the war.  Or Dr. Deneka's character I enjoyed most scenes with because of his intelligent way of justifying his own self pity and diminishing the suffering of others.  Not condoning it obviously, just saying I found his character funny.  Or Yossarian arguing his points about the war and saying that anyone who is trying to kill him is an enemy, regardless of they are on the American side. Another thing I did find interesting purely from a subjective coincidence is I just finished Crime and Punishment before this book, and it references some specific parts of C&P which amused me for that reason alone.  I also got a kick out of Schaiscoff's taking over as general and ordering parades as his most pressing agenda of things to initiate.<br /><br />There are a few other parts I was genuinely engaged in, but it was too few and far in between to give this book a rating beyond 3 stars.  Things like Nately's Whore constantly trying to kill Yossarian became tiresome and un-humorous for me, or talking about \\"Apple cheeks\\" over and over again with Orr the idiot who turns out to be the genius, or constantly repeating questions and answers.  The scene where the Soldier in White was back and everyone was freaking out was one of the few parts I just skipped over entirely.  I couldn't stand to read each character screaming \\"Oh my god he's back!!!\\" over and over again for multiple pages.  It just seemed annoying and silly to me.  And for whatever reason the chapter of the Chaplin bored me to death.<br /><br />I will say though that Heller has a great way of describing characters, scenes, environments, as I could picture them well.  Especially the ones in Rome.  He also does a good job of catching the sarcasm, slyness, or smugness of the characters.  Since just about everyone is corrupt or immoral in their own way.  I guess that's one of the points of the book, that war brings that out in people, and everyone has their own varying degree of which way they turn into that depravity.<br /><br />(SPOILERS END)<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd just say that this type of humor and writing is just not for me, though I'm sure many will and do enjoy it, I've got no problem with that. Catch 22 is a masterpiece, one I'm happy to have finished and never read again.out \\"Apple cheeks\\" over and over again with Orr the idiot who turns out to be the genius, or constantly repeating questions and answers.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob made you feel like one of his parents who never believed he was guilty until the end of the book.  At that<br />point, you could absolutely understand what went on in his mom's mind and why she did what she did. I also believed he was innocent until the end.  I found the book totally entertaining and couldn't put it down, as I myself am a parent.<br />I recommend the book highly.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Riveting every step of the way.  Perfect blend of illusion and reality.  They don't skimp on the reality, that's for sure.  Ending fell flat but I'd watch again.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was a good read. But content at times very heavy as it took one into the arena of mental health issues and abusive relationships
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great graphics, fast-paced and action packed! Sometimes these games are hit or miss but this one is far from cheesy. Great story line and for the money, you get at least 2-3 consecutive hours of heart-pounding fun! A little pricier than I would have liked, but all in all worth every penny.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very cool fun and its like having my own horse and I get to brush it and feed it and learn to care for my pet
B007BVOEPI|5.0|There's action, sex, and drama aplenty. Beautiful shots, top notch production value. One of the best shows I've seen on TV.
B00BN3EE1O|1.0|Not a huge fan of \\"Ms. Scratchy Voice\\" Hough but I thought I would give this movie a chance since a friend told me it was pretty good.  Pretty good at making me snooze - first the story (a typical Nicholas Sparks) was all a doozer.  No real storyline other than she looks crazy running around hiding and acting all mysterious.  Then you have the do-gooder - Josh D. falling in love with her and trying to protect her from something she never even explains until mid way thru the movie.  I didn't like it but maybe you will :)
B008BIZBIY|5.0|Performance exceeded my expectations<br />I've used the brand for many years<br />I would recommend this Drive<br />Plextor Customer Service very good
B004SBS8LA|5.0|just fine entertainment.... more more more....  have kindle so has to fill the hours in flight with play.... good job
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The only reason I do not give this five stars is the digital copy that was supposed to be included was not included in the product packaging.  However, Amazon support was responsive in providing options for a return or refund.<br /><br />Great series and one of the best Blu Ray interactive disks I've seen.
B005CT04T6|4.0|Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of \\"Desperado\\" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Have never read a Nicholas sparks book but have watched some books that have become movies. Was worried to read this book as there were some bad reviews but the more I thought about it I decided to anyway and....I am so glad I did. I couldn't put it down. At the end it even brought tears to my eyes and really made me think of the importance of life. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good read. Hope this review helps and you enjoy as much as I did!
B00936A0RU|5.0|This was by far the best work Shia L or Tom H have done.  It was gripping at every turn and gave you a sense of wanting the not so good but not so bad guys to win.  The story about the 3 moonshine slicking brothers was excellent.  Lots of action - couple of sad parts - mostly a happy ending -lots of awkward moments.  Only thing is that you kind of wish Shia would have been a little more assertive than being his usual (getting kicked in the pants) and then getting strength toward the end kind of guy in this film (basically he was the weaker of the 3).  Tom Hardy made me smile so many times just because his demeanor in this film was very typical but he played this character so well - you over see it.  Jessica C did a great job too - it's not easy getting nacked in front of such hotties (well maybe) but it was still amazing. Loved it and you will too :)
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD months back and received it the day after its official release. All I can say is that I am so impressed with you, Dido Armstrong! I have listened to this CD everyday and just can't seem to get enough of it. I love all 4 of Dido's CD's and &#34;Girl Who Got Away&#34; has the classic Dido touch with more confidence than her previous releases, which I thought could never be beat. There are two songs that feature a rap verse and while I don't care for rap alone, it works here very well the way it has been incorporated into the songs. There are absolutely no fillers on this album and Dido is a too good of a song writer to do that anyway. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it and if I had to choose the top 8 songs they would be: No Freedom, Girl Who Got Away, Blackbird, End Of Night, Sitting On The Roof Of The World, Day Before We Went To War, Love To Blame and Everything To Lose. This album is a combination of Pop, Folk, R&B and Ambiant and every song flows together smoothly. Buy this today!!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I have been fascinated with him since AI.  His CD did not disappoint me<br />I think he is going to be a big star
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Watched it twice while we had it rented. Peter Jackson shows his love for the book series by making a great story come to life.  Definitely looking forward to the second movie!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Something to do to pass the time. Pretty interesting. I didn't think that I would like it, but I'm in love with it.
B00BEN0YP8|4.0|Never saw this before.  To protect my ears and heart strings, I only watch such films with the sound muted.  I can tell what is going on, and I know enough history.  It prevents listening to swearing and the tears.  I'm always amazed at history.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Huge fan of movies that give my generation an idea of what living in the 30's would have been like. Whooo scary thought :) But either way this was an amazing movie.  It had gripping twist and turns and was very well thought out.  I think it depicted blacks and whites in a very interesting way. I mean it shows everyone that all cultures have something to bring to the table and doesn't neccesarily mean that one is better or inferior to the other.  Smart folks are all over.  Story was excellent - actors/actresses were excellent - movie was excellent. You be the judge :)
B00AEFXEZE|4.0|Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors and I gave this movie 4 stars because &#34;An Officer and A Gentleman&#34; will always be my absolute favorite Gere movie. Lauren Hutton is absolutely beautiful in this movie. I had never seen this movie before and was always curious about it and now I'm glad that I chose to add this to my collection.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Ok let's be honest, most action/adventure movies will never be nominated for (let alone win) the top Oscars. There are always a few exceptions (Heath Ledger, LOTR, etc) but they are few. I don't watch action movies with the idea that they will move me, if anything the trailers of most movies give so much away I usually have an idea of what's going to happen and how it will end. That being said I saw Dark of the Moon at the theater and enjoyed it enough to buy the blu ray.  I have to say that it was on par with my expectation of Michael Bay movies: loud, action packed, and lots of explosions.  I grew up watching the cartoon so perhaps my view is slightly skewed as I was stoked to see one of my favorite shows brought to life. I didn't care for the 2nd one and I thought the 3rd one was an improvement. Yes Shia LaBeouf is over the top and screaming frequently and Peter Cullen comes off pontificating whenever he speaks, but it's still a good popcorn movie.<br /><br />The video was crisp and clear, the audio sounded excellent through my dated home theater system<br /><br />One thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of special features.  I missed that it was only available for the 3D version, so that was irritating.  I've seen my share of movies in 3D and I don't personally see the need to own a 3D TV so I'm not wasting money on a 3D version of a movie.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|i have no idea who ordered this and i dont know how it was put on my account. i love the series but didnt want this
B000YXMMAO|5.0|Radiohead are truly brilliant; and this is arguably their greatest work. For additional intrigue, research the connection between this album and OK Computer... It will potentially blow your mind!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Grisham  accomplished another  good  novel with this book. I wasn't sure about  the book until I let myself become intrigued by this young boy that had so many kind qualities that he could be a remarkable kid lawyer.
B002TZS5GU|2.0|This was not by far the worst virus/ apocolypse movie I've seen...But it is a little weird. First they tell you nothing about the virus - where it came from - how it spreads (slight explanation midway thru the movie).  It's more about an out of control brother - his weaker brother and two girls (one being a girlfriend) trying to out run a virus that they can only identify by blood soaked faces, reddish rashes and facial mask. Worth your time? - Only you can tell - Not bad but not great either.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I heard this was a movie about religion , Ok I'll see. I loved the movie for the story and the visuals. good in blueray , again kinda let down on the 3D, but don't regret getting it. I'd recommend anyone watch it .
B0037AGASG|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my niece. I really don't like his music. But she loved it. 4 stars from her!
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I ordered this DVD, which I have seen a million times plus the newer Footloose CD just to have the updated version.
B005K8H8W0|5.0|The masterful layering of guitar, soulful song-writing of Billy Corgan at his most tortured, and delicate production from Butch Vig make this one of the best records ever made. Simple as that.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Realmente lo que esperaba... Aprendes de lo que se cuenta en este libro... Abarca varios temas, no s&oacute;lo la guerra...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game......it's very thrilling and adventurous....the only thing I wish it had was check points, cause I die alot and the wings only last one game and buying the other infinite wings are soo much. And I hate starting from the beginning.....Besides that great and fun game.....
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I loved the movie . I keep the CD in my car, and when I get &#34;too irritated&#34; with traffic , I pop this in to help chill things , and i remember good things about the movie
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this app is one of my favorites.  its fun and challenging not like any other gem swap games.  I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game has a few issues . It freezes up quite often. The free items you are supposed to get don't show up all the time. Points were lost when it freezes up. The amount of money it costs is outrageous to buy houses,pets,etc. Try explaining that to a 3 1/2 year old who wants to buy everything . My 7  year old finds the game boring.
B002PL5GTC|5.0|Dave Grohl is a true generational icon, and this is an amazing collection of hit songs. For me it was a perfect supplement to my record collection, as I couldn't afford vinyl copies of every Foo album, but this is the next best thing. 4 records of stand out tracks. Vinyl really brings out the sound. And the packaging and extras are really cool too. Mr. Grohl delivers, as always, for his fans. Superb!!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|This movie was everything i wanted and more. I was so excited when i received it and i am still happy about my decision. I couldn't have asked for something better.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|series well performed, the actors are great and the plot is wonderful... by I recommend you see it and follow it...
B0034G4OYK|4.0|I enjoyed it , cute , easy to watch . 3D was ok not worth the extra money , blueray was  worth it though .
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Not bad...just don't care for so many find the hidden items...story was fine...great for help and like that you can skip if you choose on puzzles.  Am pleased there was a clear ending...some<br />games leave you underwhelmed and confused.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I found the plot a bit then but loved the music!  There were some emotionally charged scenes nonetheless. It was worth the experience to watch it!
B002B554TO|4.0|Must admit, this record blew me away. Very impressive, especially on vinyl. I really think they could be one of the best new bands of the last decade. Very pure and eclectic sound/style.
B008X8QCTO|3.0|I am in the bonus chapter and it freezes when I use the glass cutter on tank and also the screwdriver on the door with hand please fix :(
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|To determine whether you are getting a good deal here or not largely depends on the current condition of your existing Eagles vinyl or CDs and whether they are in need of cheap replacement. In fulfilling such a purpose this new box set has significant merit, not least its price. Alternatively if your Eagles music collection is already in pristine condition then save your dollars. This is another no frills Rhino \\"lob them altogether in a box collection\\". The details that go with it are the grouping of the six most popular Eagles studio albums from 1972-1979. This is not counting any non-LP tracks, either live album, Eagles Live (1980) or Hell Freezes Over (1994), or 2007s studio album \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\". As with previous and similar Rhino box sets there is no new mastering to speak of. Indeed they appear to be the same masterings by Ted Jensen at New York's Sterling Sound that were issued on CD in 1999 on the Eagles Selected works that always sounded great. These may also be the same remasters that formed part of the 2005's huge Eagles (Limited Edition Box) but frankly this reviewer is not prepared to mortgage the house to find out! The albums come packaged in generally ok vinyl-replica style wallets, held within a clamshell box and the titles included in this set are as follows:<br /><br />THE EAGLES (1972) - The breezy Glyn Johns produced debut album starts off with the definitive cover of Jackson Browne's \\"Take it Easy\\" and also includes staples such as \\"Witchy Women\\" and the lovely laid back signature tune \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\". The Eagles are often rightly critiqued as popularisers of the cosmic Americana pioneered by Gram Parsons and Gene Clark. Yet the presence of Bernie Leadon on the album does give them a direct link to this tradition not least from his time in the Flying Burrito Brothers and the key supporting role that he played on the \\"Fantastic Journey of Dillard and Clark\\" where he co wrote the great country rock standard \\"Train leaves here this morning\\". The nice version here is not up to Clark's but is far superior to some of the filler present not least the dreadful \\"Chug all night\\" and the turgid \\"Take the devil\\". Still this is an excellent career starting point<br /><br />DESPERADO (1973) - This is the Western concept album that really started the Eagles ascent to the stratosphere. By the time the Old Grey Whistle Test played \\"Doolin Dalton\\" the buzz around the Eagles was huge and the flawless harmonies and vocals of Glenn Frey and Don Henley (\\"the Gods\\") really come to the forefront (and also their control freakery). This reviewer actually prefers the fragile Johnny Cash cover of \\"Desperado\\" to the original but whatever case it is a brilliant song with harmonies to die for and a great Henley lead vocal. Other standouts include the excellent Leadon composed \\"Bitter Creek\\", the equally strong Randy Meisner vehicle \\"Certain kind of fool\\" and the standout \\"Tequila sunrise\\". With \\"Desperado\\" the authenticity of the group's country underpinnings were never stronger and the album is a high water mark.<br /><br />ON THE BORDER (1974) - This is a good Eagles album although it marks the growing ascendancy of Glenn Frey's push for a more rock orientated approach with Bill Szymczyk taken on production duties and guitar virtuoso Don Felder brought in as the fifth Eagle. By this time the fights and tension in the band were building, the Laurel Canyon ethos was drowning in an avalanche of white powder but superstardom beckoned. The Tom Waits cover \\"Ol'55\\" does sadly dilute the rough charm of the original but not surprisingly \\"Already gone\\" and \\"Best of My Love\\" easily demanded inclusion on the 1975 Greatest Hits album. The Gram Parsons tribute \\"My Man\\" and the bluegrass flavoured \\"Midnight Flyer\\" are the only other songs that really pushes the brilliance of those compositions while \\"James Dean\\" despite its promotion never quite made the Eagles premier division.<br /><br />ONE OF THESE NIGHTS (1975) - The superb title track, Meisner's soaring ballad \\"Take it to the Limit\\" and what is probably the greatest Eagles song namely the brilliant \\"Lyin Eyes\\" are the centrepieces of the album and the start of the true era of cocaine cowboys. It is the album that saw Bernie Leadon part company because of the bands directional shift towards a country tinged version of stadium rock and with him went the authentic heart of the band. Success also bred conflict and in songs like \\"After The Thrill Is Gone\\" they charted the growing disillusionment and disappointment when faced with the realisation of \\"what can you do when your dreams come true, but it's not quite like you'd planned?\\"<br /><br />HOTEL CALIFORNIA (1976) - Ex James Gang guitar hero Joe Walsh joins the band and the rest is history. The ubiquitous title track describing the sunshine state as a modern day babylon dominated FM radio in the US for years, as much as \\"Stairway to heaven\\"; the Mexican flavoured \\"New kid in town\\" is very fine, while Frey also stated that \\"Last Resort\\" was Henley's greatest song. This is an album that is revered as the Eagles stone cold classic yet in truth it contains a couple of below par tracks not least Walsh's turgid \\"Pretty maids in a row\\" and the sluggish overwrought Henley composition \\"Victim of Love\\". Did \\"Wasted time\\" also need an orchestral reprise? From hereon however it was inexcusable not to know what \\"colitas\\" meant.<br /><br />THE LONG RUN (1979) - A horrible album that emerged after three years of hellish bickering and rows. It contains the three worse Eagles songs \\"The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks.\\" \\"Teenage Jail\\" and \\"The Disco Strangler\\". There are a couple of hits here not least the solid \\"Heartache tonight\\" and the pleasant Timothy Schdmit lead on the gentle soft rock of \\"I can't tell you why\\". The overall impression however is of a poor and over produced Don Henley solo album. It paved the way to the bands long split and the infamous July 31, 1980, concert in Long Beach, California, where Frey and Felder threatened all kinds of lurid violence on each other's person on stage on what has since become known as \\"Long Night at Wrong Beach\\".<br /><br />History shows that the Eagles are one of the most popular bands of all time and of course they still tread the boards in what seems like a never ending farewell tour where they air these songs. Today however they are as much remembered for the scale and destructiveness of their creative car crash under the strains of fast living, vicious personal disagreements and contractual obligations. Nonetheless setting aside the tumultuous history and listening intently again to these albums the often levelled accusation that the Eagles represent the summit of bland, overly comfortable and faintly ridiculous middle of the road rock really doesn't stand close examination. For many they were also a starting point for a deeper journey back to the great originators of country rock not only Gram Parsons but also further to founders like Hank Williams for which eternal gratitude should flow. There are some very poor songs on this box set it is true but the many great ones are effortless and timeless, forming a key component of the DNA of rock history. By any standards from this heyday period they deserve the status of a classic American band and the deep respect that flows from this.e track, Meisner's soaring ballad \\"Take it to the Limit\\" and what is probably the greatest Eagles song namely the brilliant \\"Lyin Eyes\\" are the centrepieces of the album and the start of the true era of cocaine cowboys.

B000007UXS|5.0|Unique offering from one of the most unique artists of the modern era. This really lays the groundwork for where they will branch out on OK Computer, but is a more simplified, holistic effort; which relies on more traditional rock simplicity.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Love this CD. This is the perfect compilation for any Garbage fan. All the good stuff on one disc. I listen to it all the time in my car. Second best only to a live show.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is great! The load came really fast and the definition was great! My son loved it! We will watch it over and over!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First of all, I'm not in love with the actual look of the backpack when I wear it compared to my other backpack that's twice as expensive, but it's not bad. But opened up, this it excellent! I needed a good case to safely put all my camera equipment for video shoots and this is amazing! It's so inexpensive but doesn't feel cheap. The outside pocket is big enough for a 13 inch Macbook Pro. Also, it doesn't scream \\"EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT INSIDE\\" like the branded Nikon or Canon cases. I use a much more expensive backpack at my job for their equipment and the inside has a similar feel. Definitely recommended for photographers/videographers on a budget!
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved the heroine of the story. Katsa's journey to being pawn to master of her own self was empowering.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I love Steven Spielberg films; however this film was as boring as they come. The actor that played Lincoln did a great job; however I was not really impressed by the movie. It had some good parts, but not really something I would spend 2 1/2 hours.
B002W24COO|5.0|Nevermind was the breakthrough album, but In Utero was the artistic breakthrough which truly allowed a glimpse into Kurt's tortured soul. The sound is pure and is masterfully captured. Grohl's drumming is visceral and provides a vibrant sense of life with each beat. For me, this is Nirvana's masterpiece.
159448385X|4.0|The story wasn't quite as captivating as Kite Runner but it was well written and I like that the author shows pride for his country while never ignoring the challenges their society has yet to overcome.
B008JIWNYG|5.0|Setting as I know very little about green lantern besides what I've seen in justice league new 52 and that can be summed up as arrogant jerk I actually really liked this comic, maybe because sidestep was so interesting but yeah Hal was pretty awesome too, will definitely keep reading
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm hooked!  Great challenge for an old brain like mine.  My  goal is to get a perfect score on each one, so that means having to do them over and over sometimes to achieve that.  Thanks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so awesome it feels like u own a real horse<br />even my mom liked it man good to have this game.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series has wonderful characters with their own set of problems, but they all are like a family and help each other when things get tough for one of them.  It is a great series for families too, if you could get your kids to watch it.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Another fantastic album! Blake's heart, soul and sense of humor all shine in his music!  Run, don't walk to get \\"Based on a True Story!\\"
B0088TG252|5.0|Mr. Washington, did it again. I recommend this movie, if u like action, mystery and suspense. Out of all the movies Denzel Washington, has starred in, Training Day is by far my favorite. In Save House, I love his nonchalant attitude although his life is at state.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I really like this game, great for killing time and very interesting. Good graphic and animation. Never have had a problem loading game.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very good movie.  Visually outstanding cinematography along with an interesting story.  nine more words required a bit of a foolish review requirement
B004SIP7AS|5.0|This was a delightful love story! Gweneth and Jeremy were great together, as was the rest of the cast of characters.  No nudity (just cleavage), no profanity, just good, clean fun.  The climatic love scene where Jeremy finally gets around to asking Gweneth (Emma), to marry him is in my view, was innocently intimate -- HOW LOVE SHOULD BE, always but today has been twisted into sheer animal sensuality.  I give this movie my &#34;THUMBS UP&#34; because it portrays LOVE the way LOVE ought to be, even today.  Based on the original story written by Jane Austin, who's work I happen to like to begin with.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved being able to see the emotion of the actors while singing.  Not everyone can sing as well as the people who do this on stage, but this,movie  portrays the emotions better.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|This may have to do with my love of Christina Aguilera, but this woman knows how to put on a breathtaking, unbelievable, high energy show. A true entertainer.
B001J9AQA0|5.0|i was kind of skeptical at first buying this album, but i'm really glad i did. it ended up being a great album that is really good to listen to while studying.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I loved it so much, I bought the book which is just as good. and Daniel Day Lewis is spectacular!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Was in amazing condition when recieved! Brings back lots of fun and crazy memories of my childhood and I know that my sister is going to love it!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Like that it was historically authentic England several centuries ago.  The costumes, countryside, dances, language, customs - all very well portrayed, as were the characters.  Besides all this, the story itself is a true classic tale of romance and relationships.  All without having to be tortured with profanity (cussing) and nudity which peppers so much of our modern Television and video movies.  It's shameful and obnoxious, what modern movie writers, producers, and editors collaborate together to make our stomachs turn - in the name of so called, 'entertainment!'  In my opinion, listening to profanity and watching nudity on TV, is NOT the least bit entertaining!<br /><br />This movie is clean, and suitable for older children.  The only exceptional parts might be the &#34;cleavages&#34; shown by the low-cut women's dresses.
B007N85POS|5.0|I love the earlier Angry Birds games.  I've also played the piggies one and the space game - not crazy about them, but love these.
B008KE3960|4.0|Takes a bit to get use to using your finger to control your planes, however, once this is mastered it is a fun game. Lots of plane options.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|great movie, definitely a classic. danny devito does an excellent job. i hope this movie is not forgotten with time, as it is hard to find and you don't see it around much anymore.
B007EJ6S92|4.0|Moonspell has had it's ups and downs over the years.  This is one of their better albums since my favorite Irreligious.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Was in great condition! Been looking for this movie for a while that wasn't on blue ray! Great birthday present for my sister! She will love it!!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|It was a delight to watch this movie. The acting was top-notch all around and it didn't take itself too seriously.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It seems to be a pretty good app.  I really haven't used it much as yet.  Nice and easy to read.
B0054N73EY|3.0|muy bueno lo recomiendo exvelente como se arreglo con el vendedor, tiempos y formas segunlo programado de antemano, muchas gracias
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Heard about this film and I was pleased to find it available. Great that it won the Academy Award. Recommend
B00AFEY354|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is probably one of the most wonderfully sad movies I have ever seen. The whole movie was beautifully done. The actors and actresses did a fabulous job and I felt like I was reliving someones actual life. I think everyone could take something from this movie.
B005P89F1C|1.0|I only bought this because a dear niece likes him.  I don't like him or his music.  This was a gift to her otherwise my review would be [...]
B0063GORYU|5.0|I  think that this is a more challenging game than the regular game.  While it takes some skill and concentration it is fun and winnable.  I ordered the free version but I would be willing to pay to play.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|fun fun fun....I play every day. its just like bejewelled but cooler. I recommend it to everyone likes jewel games
B009A9BF5G|3.0|muy bueno lo recomiendo exvelente como se arreglo con el vendedor, tiempos y formas segunlo programado de antemano, muchas gracias
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love being able to view on Prime thru roku? Wish we could get subtitles on some of these tv series
B003F7YJSY|4.0|Released by RCA Victor on 6/17/69, FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS (LSP-4155) was Elvis Presley's 35th LP for that label. It peaked at #13 on Billboard's 200, with the single \\"In the Ghetto\\" reaching #3 on their Hot 100. It was the King's first Top Ten hit since \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" (1965).<br /><br />This album came at a turning point in E's career. His movie contract finished, Elvis vowed to never again record a song he didn't believe in. After the success of his Dec.'68 NBC-TV comeback special and the resulting soundtrack LP, Presley made good on that promise. The result is a set of music that blends country and blues with rock, old material with new. Pleased with the results, Elvis called \\"In Memphis\\" his best work in 15 years.<br /><br />Quality of vocals and musicianship is excellent throughout. A classic album if ever there was one!<br /><br />RANDOM NOTES<br />The longest track, a bluesy update of Eddy Arnold's 1947 single \\"I'll Hold You in My Heart,\\" opens with two consecutive false starts with no break before the song begins in earnest. Preferable are less-dense cuts, like a cover of Johnny Tillotson's \\"It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin'\\" (1962). \\"Long Black Limousine\\" by contrast has so many players and singers the King's voice gets partly obscured.<br /><br />Although a product of the late '60's, Presley's powerful \\"After Loving You\\" could easily be from a decade earlier. His version of \\"I'm Movin' On,\\" a Hank Snow chart topper from 1950, is a bit mumbly but it really rocks, especially when the brass kicks in. The Mac Davis song \\"In the Ghetto,\\" a sorrowful tale of a young minority who commits a crime and pays for it with his life, was and remains a unique commentary on the racial divide in America.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[2:41] Wearin' That Loved On Look (1/13/69)<br />[2:45] Only the Strong Survive (2/19/69)<br />[4:31] I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms) (1/22/69)<br />[3:41] Long Black Limousine (1/13/69)<br />[2:35] It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin' (2/20/69)<br />[2:50] I'm Movin' On (1/14/69)<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[2:35] Power of My Love (2/18/69)<br />[3:20] Gentle on My Mind (1/14/69)<br />[3:05] After Loving You (2/18/69)<br />[2:37] True Love Travels on a Gravel Road (2/17/69)<br />[2:55] Any Day Now (2/20/69)<br />[2:44] In the Ghetto (1/20/69)<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 36:19tin' (2/20/69)<br />[2:50] I'm Movin' On (1/14/69)<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[2:35] Power of My Love (2/18/69)<br />[3:20] Gentle on My Mind (1/14/69)<br />[3:05] After Loving You (2/18/69)<br />[2:37] True Love Travels on a Gravel Road (2/17/69)<br />[2:55] Any Day Now (2/20/69)<br />[2:44] In the Ghetto (1/20/69)<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 36:19
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a moving story of love, mental illness, family dysfunction, family love, and redemption after all hope is lost. I only bought this book because after all the hype the movie version received this year, I knew it must be a wonderful story, and indeed, it is. Now I can see the movie and know all the subtle back story that  can't be condensed into the space of a 90 minute film.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A great summary of where we are and where we need to go.  We've got great examples of female leaders in this country and many ready to become great leaders.<br /><br />I found it really informative and inspiring to hear about Sheryl's road to her leadership positions.  It's a great read!!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|There are some kids' movies that are unwatchable by adults. This is not one of those movies. I don't know about watching it every day for a week straight, but every couple of months? Definitely. Very fun, lots of game references, and if you haven't 'paused' it before the credits roll, do so.
0316224588|5.0|Another Rebus book is finally out. Can't wait for it to end. Pray that it never does. Although we know it has to.
B003IDMUWC|5.0|for my money this is john grisham;s greatest book, well worth reading, I thoroughly enjoyed it, would recommend it to anyone
0446677450|4.0|Nice read. Easy to follow. Overview and some new ideas I've never heard before. Great read for the beginner in real estate.
B009GQ57ES|3.0|I can't say I'm in love with this album, but it 's growing on me.  Thriftshop is great, but you can hear Macklemore working out some personal issues through his music.  Hell I got it for a $1.99.  I'm getting my moneys worth.  Give it a listen and judge for yourself.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Neil alone on stage in the dark, belting out raw sound from that Humbucker pickup in Ol' Black.  Who says a 65-year-old man can't rock!?  Songs like Sign of Love and Hitchhiker stick in your head and make you come back for more.  Classics like Ohio and Down by the River are here and still strong.  Neil Young, keep on rockin'!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|An enjoyable addition to the series and a nice surprise for I did not expect any more to be made.
B005CVWWJY|4.0|Filled with geek references and polite nods to affluent contemporary persons, this book is a fun narrative through a very possible future.<br /><br />Any fans of science fiction will enjoy this book, a definite read.
B003IDMUSG|5.0|great book but then I am a john grisham fan, edge of the seat stuff, very good read, would recommend
0767821629|4.0|Great film. Lost it shortly thereafter. Hard to get a hold of one. All new, great shape when recieved. Nice.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is a great book for any person wanting to change thier lives and teaches you how to have graittude for what you have.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good game. Sometimes when I open it up after I start puzzle it does not give me the 288 piece puzzle I started with.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Saw at the show and it is a wonderful movie.  Gave to granddaughter for birthday and she loves it too.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|For some reason thought this role for Natalie Portman was out of character but loved her.  Role was Asthon Kutcher for sure...
B003IDMUVI|5.0|gripping read as are all of john grisham's books, I like the way he has a twist at the end
0671015206|4.0|Very Nice condidion. new. nice read. easy to follow and understand. Overview, not too detailed. Great for the beginner. Thanks.
0425264386|4.0|While the concept for this story is good, there is something missing in Lee's writing.  In addition, the stories ending is kind of chopped, leaving me thinking about Lee's writing skills, rather than the character/story that I get from other writers.  I hope that his gets better with time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have a kindle fire HD and I just love this alarm clock it wakes me up in the morning for school!!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I got my movie in 4 days! When I opened it there was not 1 scratch on it and the case looks brand new! I was afraid it would be beat up since I only paid a few dollars for it but it was perfect! I will always order from gohastings
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|I have purchased many DVDs (normal, Blu-Ray and 3D Blu-Ray) from Amazon and so far all of them have played on my equipment at home in Australia...until now! It is interesting that the normal DVD in this package played fine but the Blu-Ray one gave me a &#34;wrong region&#34; error and wouldn't play. At least I saw the movie which was very good but I paid for a Blu-Ray disc and didn't get one that worked. I know all about the warnings on the Amazon site that the discs may not play in other regions but I'm very disappointed because every other one I bought worked fine but this one wouldn't. Why would this one be different from all the others?
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was 21. I've read it about every 3 years for the past 15 years of my life. I treasure Don Miguel Ruiz's wisdom, his 4 agreements, and the path to freedom.  It always inspires me to make my life better, to expand the love I feel and give in my heart, and each time I read it, I see it with a little more insight than the last time I read it.  It makes me a better, doctor, a better artist, a better friend, a better daughter, a better sister, and a better person.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is addicting. I was so happy to find season 3 available to watch on Amazon and the episodes are loaded directly to my tv with my Wii! I love it!
0792156684|5.0|Saw this movie when it first came out and wanted to see it again.  Love the story.  Will probably watch again and not very movies I care to see more then once.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I love that movie a lot of action and a lot of big actors hell i give it a 10. love to get it free ya right lol.But all in all it is the best this year
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story from beginning to end. The characters are full and exciting to learn about. Really great book!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|This is a great album.  Who doesn't love Phil Collins?  If you don't love Phil Collins, you are a horrible person.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love purchasing Amazon videos. The quality is always superb and I have the ability to watch my shows on the go. I hadn't starting watching Walking Dead until last week so I was excited to see that Amazon had all of season 3 for me to purchase and catch up. Able to knock out the whole series in a week!  Thanks!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was always one of my favorite musicals and the movie really takes it to a new level.  Truly a must-have!
B00136Q6DA|5.0|Little voice is not the correct title for this album.  Sara Bareilles has a huge voice. and it is beautiful to listen to, her songs have a message but is not preachy if you love women with strong sexy voices then you need to get Little Voices.
0345529057|4.0|I recommend the books and highly recommend HBO's Game of Thrones! Needless to say, after watching the first season before reading the book I found myself skimming/speed reading the chapters as HBOs depiction is well done ( George helps with the series)
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Outstanding performances by many actors, and a glimpse at how the abolition of slavery came about.  Really needs to be seen by all.
1401937519|2.0|I could not make it to the end. I  read Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven so bought this after seeing all the 5 stars. She seems to find herself very interesting. She repeated everything and said very little. Very thin and drawn out. I do not agree withthereviewers who say she is a great writer. This is not a great writer. Not a lot about the actual NDE but a lot about what she thought it meant and the same thing said over and over again.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|without preaching or religion a message of the wonder and beauty of childhood wrapped in a beautifully designed package that is cute ,fun and with a tingle of darkness .... well worth the viewing and owning .
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Even when I was a kid, I enjoyed the Hobbit far more than the other books in the Lord of the Rings series.  I just found that it had a much better pace.<br /><br />This translated into a movie that works better as a Sci-Fi action movie than the rest of the movies in the franchise.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I bought this movie to appease my nephew.  like all kids in their terrible twos he doesn't like to sit still but the visuals in this movie are so brilliant that he will stand there in front of the television as long as it is on.  The story line is a little dark as a group of misfits search for the guardians so that they can stop an evil owl. Breathtaking artwork
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This does exactly what it's supposed to.  Now we only need one charger for the macbook pro and macbook air.  As a plus, it sticks to our metal frame coffee table when not in use.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Emily Blunt is the bomb!!!!!!!!  Brilliant actress and portrays Queen Victoria's life with excellence.  Rupert Friend was excellent as Prince Albert.  I loved the beautiful innocence of Romance portrayed.  Maybe not a film for your children but definitely one that a couple would enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If something touches your heart, it was worth it...this touches my heart! This gives me hope in seemingly hopeless<br />times .
B002JWD6AS|5.0|this is and awesome book if u were a jacob fan in twilight u have to read this werewolf with human not meant to meet but some how it all comes together
0811879542|5.0|What a fun book.  Bought it for my grandson's birthday, received it at work and played with it myself for about a half hour.  The concept that a small spot or circle can generate action with simple directions, counting, physical interaction of blowing on the page or shaking the book and resulting in lots of laughs is wonderful. I really would like to keep it for myself and use it in employee training classes but think I'll take it to my grandson as a special surprise instead of making him wait for the birthday party.  Besides, it will be fun to see him \\"press here\\" as we turn the pages together.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|If I had been in a movie theater I would have walked out and asked for my money back. This movie got way too much hype for what it truly was. The best thing about this movie was Tom Cruise and his hilarious character. Those parts were funny. The rest of the movie was done like a college film project: put as many gross jokes and uncomfortable situations as possible to make people squirm. Blah!!
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|CAUTION-- BOX ADVERTISEMNT&#34; THE NEXT AVATAR&#34;. What a joke. Not even close to it. This is such a crapy movie. So foolish of me buying a 3d, wasting my money. Dont buy this reading other reviews about how gr8 the pic. is. Of course its gonna be gr8 but its not beacause of movie its your 3d tv, dont push your limits on your wallet. invest in something else, it will be amazing because its your tv. This is more like a zoo movie.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have another version of Pride & Prejudice  which I really like but I enjoyed this version as well.  It has some differences but basically the same story line.  My girls enjoyed it!  I will definitely watch it again and again.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Quick & easy read. It reads just as Bobby portrays in the series. Liked it a lot. Worth the time to read.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|Most interesting if you know NYC. Disappointed that Jack did not seem to make any friends as he usually does in these stories. He was almost a step away from the action, as though watching from some distance rather than being there himself. I think I have read too many Reacher books, as this one was not as captivating as some of the previous ones but it was still a good read.
076115728X|4.0|Bought this book for my three year old grandson and think it's too much for him to understand.  The pages are easy to read but nothing catches the eye as they turn.  Plus I think some of the pages would be very easy to tear out if extra care isn't made.  If he were able to understand the concept of, mistakes are ok and can turn out all right, then it would be fine.  It's just too big a concept for him right now.  I'll save it for next year's birthday.
B00633W614|1.0|Plot twists are unrealistic and convenient. It was like a bad soap opera. The character development was stilted. I didn't believe in the story. Too many things simply made no sense.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|This was not my favorite season of Dexter, but I enjoyed it for the most part. It as all the fun, Dexter gore and inner-monolgue that fans enjoy.
0800141660|4.0|I always enjoy Sense & Sensibility particulary this version.  Clean and filled with innocence.  A great story line portrayed.  Great actors and actresses!
1569242739|5.0|I absolutely love this book!! So far I have made 3 of the cupcake recipes in it and they have come out fantastic!! She even gives hints on how to make them gluten free, as well as including some gluten free recipes. The Coconut Lime cupcakes are honestly the best cupcakes I have ever tasted, and they're vegan!! I just need to find more excuses to make cupcakes!<br />AMAZING!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Stars speak for themselves. No need to review a classic. If you have no read this,,,READ IT!! End of story.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My husband really likes the show. He would recommend this to any one. Great entertainment for those who like this type.
B000ZBUY78|5.0|This is a great watch. Looks great for work/casual. I love self winding watches and this one is a great price. The only complaint I have is that the pin or whatever you call the part on the side that you pull out to set the time, is hard to pull out. If you're in a hurry and you haven't worn the watch in a couple of days and need to set it, it can be challenging. So, lesson learned, don't try to set time when you're in a hurry. Other than that, I love this watch and have had it for almost two years.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have played it alot I like it cause the you move a little fast.A nd you get to seee how the points add up
B003THHIEM|5.0|It has humor (many laughs) some romance and great plots. You can figure out who the perp is along with them. Great casting. Everybody should have a family like theirs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome!<br /><br />Can't do one word.  Not many books can bring about the emotions you feel when reading this book.  Highly recommend!<br />Again.  Awesome!!
B00B4W8AIW|4.0|With the return of Jesse to KSE I was so so pumped and still am since his return. Howard wasn't really the right fit for KSE and honestly I stopped listening to them after alive or just breathing (best album btw). Jesse vocals in this album are just amazing his singing and screaming have always been top notch. The music is very good defiantly a metal album for sure, but the thing is when I listen too i am kind of disappointed that they lost their heavy sound. KSE had some very powerful heavy parts and unique breakdowns in their older stuff even on end of heartache album. That is why I did not rate it 5 stars it just feels like a weaker KSE than before but as for the metal gos it defiantly delivers.<br /><br />Im glad jesse is back
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Saw it at the movies just had to have it. Liked the characters. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type
B003L77G38|5.0|I'm a big fan of this show and highly recommend everyone to give it a try...you will not be disappointed!!!👍👽👍
B00005MP58|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I have watched it about 10 times since I got the movie. Wish I had more time to watch it again and again
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Loved the examples used throughout the book and audio. Created within me a new way to look at everything around me. It was all FANTASTIC!!
B005LAIH9K|5.0|Very well done!!  Enjoyed the entire movie!!<br />Nice addition to the American Pie Collection. Nice to see the development of the characters over the years
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An excellent book. I can't wait to start the third one. I would recommend this book to any romantic reader.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|And that's a huge compliment.<br />This is a truly lovely first love story taking place in the 80s (you can tell because... well, tapes, no cell phones, no internet...) but it could pretty much be nowadays in a less privileged city too.<br /><br />I loved that Park and Eleanor are so not mainstream - not in their looks, not in their attitude.<br />Thank God, Eleanor is not your typical \\"beautiful but does not know it\\" girl who is transformed into a super model at the end of the book. And Park is not a knight in shining armour - the book is almost as much about social standing at school and bullying as it is about first love between the two of them. And family.<br /><br />Quite simply, the love story rings true and is completely engrossing, and that's rarely the case for such books.<br /><br />It's hard to say more without spoiling it, so I'll end with a recommendation: on top of Erich Segal \\"Love Story\\", I think people who enjoyed this book will also like \\"The Butterfly tatoo\\" by Philip Pullman. The themes are similar, although Pullman's story is darker. And also \\"On little wings\\" by Regine Sirois on a lighter note.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a well-written show. It has clever story lines that weave all the characters we remember from our fairytales and then adds another layer to it. The entire premise of the series is ingenious and the actors are well cast. I can't say much more without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet. Try it. Start at the beginning of season one. This continues it and it gets better. You won't be disappointed!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This is my favorite Clutch album ever!  it's got all the blues, southern rock, metal antics that you have come to know and love from the band.  Keep'm coming boys!  Thanks for another great album!
B000W9EOEC|4.0|The CD got here on time and as described.<br />I gave it 4 stars because when it arrived it had a crack on the front.<br />No problem, just an annoyance.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Very enjoyable movie...love anything with Joseph Gordon Levitt in it!!!!!!! one two three four five six seven eight nine end.
B000002KDS|5.0|I do love it... thank you...the songs its the  best, that, ,,, he did it,, and the cover it's magical,
B00BESM14U|4.0|This movie was great!! loved the story and all the characters. loved the way the directer set up the flash backs too. Awesome but creepy twist at the end.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I've only watched 2 episodes and so far I like it. I like the amount of story lines the best.
B005OGYH90|5.0|This is awesome!  Slash is a freaking master of music.  Myles Kennedy is a pretty damn good singer as well, and does an really good job covering the old G'NR tunes.
B00000JG41|5.0|Wait a minute, are we talking about the product and not the transaction?<br />Oh damn, well, the last three CD's are all really great and I would recommend them to anyone with an ear.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Stories of English gentry have always been my favorite.  It is hard finding adjectives to describe the acting, actors, storyline, directing and the wonderful creation of Mr. Fellowes.  It is superb...I will be so sad when it comes to an end.  I truly look forward to the next season and hope it will not be the last.  Thank you Masterpiece for one of the most wonderful programs I have ever seen.
B001E8WNNO|4.0|It was cheaper and better than renting from video store or using Netflix.  Netflix only has this video on DVD and the cost is far greater and less convenient that ordering in this way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show.  Great story line and good acting.  Wish it wasn't over already!  Will be anxiously awaiting the next season.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's a well-written novel about a man's struggle. The book plans the plot so well and engages the readers a lot. I finished reading it in two days because I was eager to find out what happened. However, the movie totally ruined the story by changing it to a totally different story. The only thing in common are the characters' names. If you like the movie, I'd highly recommend reading the book.
B009YU62H2|5.0|This is a great come back album from one of my favorite bands from the 90's.  Looking forward to many more from Soundgarden.  Keep kicking ass guys!

0782002064|5.0|This should be seen by everyone. It certainly touches the meaning of life!  I would love to see a remake with Robin Williams as Clarence, the angel.....All in all this is a movie for all time . I watch it whenever it is on and have my copy forever with my precious collection of masterpieces.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much,so much so I found it hard to put down once I started reading it. Michael Crichton is an awesome author and I will definitely read more of his novels.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Lemony Snicker is just so clever! His imaginative definitions of words expanded my vocabulary when I read these books as a child and are still expanding it now; they are my favorite part of this series besides Snicket's hilariously dry sense of humor. Though the subject matter may seem a bit inappropriate for children (Count Olaf makes a lot of rather violent threats, \\"The Marvelous Marriage\\", etc., I missed the adult themes and undertones during my first reading.<br /><br />A Series of Unfortunate Events is riveting, a word which here means, thrilling and exciting if one can overcome the misery of watching the Baudelaire orphans suffer at the hands of the treacherous and terrible Count Olaf and his band of freakish accomplices.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is practically a classic. Everyone loves it (accept as few haters). It is about a pack of little Gorillas chasing you because you took their monkey idol. The powerups and change of characters give you something to look forward to as you collection coins running for your life through the endless temple grounds. I would recommend this in a heartbeat. Get it. Get it NOW! GET IT AND NEVER LET IT GO!<br /><br />(5 OUT OF 5 ON THE APPER SCALE.)
B009NCM248|5.0|This whole album is amazing!  I absolutely cannot wait to buy part 2 when it comes out in April.  Corey Taylor is a mad man!
B0093X80VQ|4.0|This book is a wonderful book behind the Charlie and the chocolate factory. I recommend this for Roald Dahl's fans.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Love ASUS as always, great production technique, and materials and functions. The quality is better than M5G i think. WIFI to go is lovely.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Condemned to say about the other side of May and a regular season and a few days later in a way that you can see the first place in a few days later this month of May be a way to get a few weeks back in the first time in time to be able the first to be a way to go through a way of life for all bone marrow transplant patients with chronic pain and more people Confront the same thing the same way as well as the first place
B009UX2YAC|5.0|From the very first day this game was downloaded on my Kindle - I'm hooked - I love to see the characters begging me to get them running although they know they will be caught - always bring a smile on my face playing this game.
0062238868|5.0|This book takes you into the world of a sniper better than any book I have read. This book not only offers the reader an unflinching straight foreward insight into what it takes to be Americas best and most deadly sniper but also the price paid by so many families of service memembers. Its a triumphant account of sacrifice, patriotism and comradery in battle and in the face of life after the horrors of war. America has surely lost one of its greatest heros RIP Chris Kyle.
B0098VXE50|5.0|I thought it would be good just from the previews I saw on TV, but damn!  I love how Hollywood is finally redoing all the old dark fair tells in their true darkness of what they are.  This is dark, violent, and full of action.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's simple but very addictive. Still I wish there were more coins to play in this awesome and fun game.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I've been following the recommendations in this book for 6 weeks now and the results have been amazing. I never really followed a formal strength training program. I just wandered from one exercise to the next. This book presents the information you need to know in a clear fashion and even presents a truly effective program. I highly recommend this book to anybody wanting to build muscle. I gave it a four star because the author can sometimes dive a little too deep in the science behind his thinking. I agree everyone should know the basic/fundamentals but you can easily skip numerous pages without losing any value.
1616614609|5.0|I loved the original Netrunner, and this version is actually a big improvement. A few of the rules are simplified or redone, and the artwork is much better. Plus its now a Living Card Game, which means its a lot less expensive than the old Trading Card Game.<br /><br />Also, its MUCH better than Magic: The Gathering in my opinion. The main reason for this is Netrunner has a limited number of actions per player per turn. This eliminates the overpowered combos of MtG, and 10 minute turns. Its much more balanced as well, with very few (if any) truly broken combos. Also, you don't have to draw into your resources (mana in MtG), you can gain resources at any time. This means getting a bad draw in Netrunner happens far less than MtG.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Netrunner is the asymmetrical gameplay. This means both players use different rules and goals. While it may not sound like it, this actually leads to a more balanced gameplay than I would have thought. The games are full of aggression, tension, trickery, and surprises. Highly recommended for anyone who's a fan of competitive card games.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well it's kinda fun but it could use more characters and goods and the eggs on the ground not the top of a train were we can not get
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|What happened on this album?  Glad I bought this as a gift for someone else.  I really like this band, but man, they missed the mark on this one.  Seems like this was a rushed, not very well thought out album at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best horse games ive ever played. I wish the bars were bigger in some of the competions.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|been a customer with amazon for 7 years and a huge nicholas sparks fan had been wanting this movie for a long time was so happy to see amazon had it the price was outstanding for someone on fixed income strongly recommend ordering directly from amazon they are the best company and this movie is a must-see well worth watching thanks amazon
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Eben Alexander spends far too long trying to prove, scientifically, that he did not imagine the experience. As a mortal I would have preferred more information about Heaven itself. I recommend &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;which is far more informative about the unknown.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|It was is finishing if you started it already, but a little dull. I would not recommend it. So it goes
B006LSZECO|5.0|I Love the way this book is written.  It's a great read, keeps you guessing and then makes you wonder .
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It's awesome! I love pictures and doodling, so this application is wonderful! It has cool stickers and many different ways to decorate your pictures.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Eyeopening and educational a great story of hardship and respect between foes. Extreamly well written and well worth the time.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|2012 Les Miserables is one of the best movie adaption musical I saw in recent year! It was NOT my favorite on-stage (saw it in London with bad seating, and I fell asleep!), but this version managed to attract my attention throughout!<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was outstanding, Russell Crowe did his job. All the young actors were great, including Amanda Seyfried!<br /><br />Of course, Anne Hathaway performance was worthy of her Oscar win, though she died just half an hour into the movie! Her version of I Dreamed A Dream was one long take, NO CUT! She was great - both singing and acting!<br /><br />Properly framed at 1.85 with DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1, this Region A Universal released come with sufficient Bonus Features and DVD copy! Image is sharp and sounds great!<br /><br />At 2 hours 38 minutes, it is a long movie! Be prepare!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I can not rate this because I had to send my  kindle fire  back to the amazon .com because it would not work in Canada  very  very unhappy we loved that kindle fire HD
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved that both characters are flawed.  Adds more realism to the story. Tamer that FSOG but definitely better written. Interested to see how the next book goes.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Must see especially if you liked \\"Just Friends\\". Natalie Portman was awesome and hot!  Five star all the way in my book!
B0089OBLDO|4.0|Works great, love the PS2 controller connection as well.  I use this to use a wired 360 controller on PS3, plug and play easy to use.  This definetally DOES NOT work with the 360 wireless controller receiver.  I tried it despite what I've read and confirmed that it doesn't work, although it would be awesome if it did.  Overall good product for the price.
0783225547|5.0|This is one of my go to movies.<br /><br />It's a fun movie to watch.  I would definitely recommend watching it.
159420411X|4.0|This emphatically pro-science and pro-technology book is about enhancing your forecast skills using Bayes' theorem.  Mr. Silver analyzes probabilities in such diverse topics as poker, the stock market, baseball, weather and global warming, terrorism etc.  While the amount of information captured has been on the rise, so is the noise which is a distraction to successfully predicting outcomes.  The most effective forecasters are the ones you seldom hear about, or what he calls \\"foxes\\".  They exhibit commanding attention to detail, and speak in probabilistic terms rather than grand predictions.  Then there are the media pundits; the \\"hedgehogs\\" who make bold predictions, and right or wrong they receive the lion's share of the press.  They speak more out of ideology, which reduces their objectivity - aka Wall Street Journal Op-Ed contributors.  Hence their forecasts are more often wrong but the audience seldom keeps track.  Perhaps the most glaring example is Peggy Noonan's November 5th, 2012 garbage filled drivel in the Wall Street Journal about her gut feeling that Romney would win the presidential election.  \\"All the vibrations are right....something old is roaring back.\\"  This piece, if it can be called that, was in reaction to Mr. Silver's prediction showing Obama as the clear winner in the electoral vote.<br /><br />Serious forecasters work under the radar with little fan fair and thrills.  And that's how this book was written; nothing extreme, and no earth shattering predictions or discoveries which probably didn't make the publisher happy, but made for a rather flat yet very effective book.  This is omelet without cheese, but with nutritious veggies.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|No thriller or entrigue to speak of, just a good old fashioned drama. Plot and character arcs were nice if not abit over the top at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game. I like the challenges that you have to get done.  I like the characters that you can buy. I like the jetpack.You get a lot of couns  with<br />jetpack.I like the egg hunt in Rome.I like how it gets faster.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I liked the length of the cable...which is the main reason why I purchased it... but it didn't work with my phone. So I had to return it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|After seeing the Jersey Boys I decided to get the &#34;Best of Frankie Valli&#34; and not the sound track.<br />Definitely NOT disappointed!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very powerful movie.  The plot and circumstances in which the characters are portrayed are very real-to-life.  Unlike many movies of this genre, this film presents characters that must face challenges that we all encounter.  I was both moved to tears and laughter.  I am buying a copy for my church's library.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I found this book very adventurism and it was all about them surviving in the games
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like hidden object games that are fun and enjoyable. Good graphics and simple story line.  I  like<br />G5 entertainment games, they are interesting and challenging.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This is a great ending to a great series.  Plenty of action and conflict.  We get to follow Hana a little more and see what she is going through after being cured.  The ending almost feels a little unfinished, but it leaves you with a great final thought.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game.  A lot of fun.  Graphics are pretty deep.  Replay value high.  I really enjoyed playing this game.  Eat and upgrade.
B00BUI6D2A|1.0|I don't normally review music albums but felt compelled to comment on how terrible this was. I had to skip most of the songs. I really tried and held out hope because I figured there must be one really awesome song there that must be the reason for the album release. Nope.
B0088RUM50|4.0|For those who love Kreator will really love the album, it's fast, loud and brutal, the solos are nice and crisp.  highly recommended
0896898288|5.0|Fun book to read and can't wait to start this quilt.  CD is also so helpful.  You will enjoy making this unique quilt.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I had to learn the game by trial and error.  I find it challenging and like the fact that it requires you to think ahead through the moves
B00APUYWYA|1.0|We might have laughed at this movie only once.  If you want to watch idiots sing, what Glee, it's better.  There is my 20 word review of this movie.
B00BW5K5DO|2.0|not the full game and too much to upgrade so didn't like it  Want the full game to be able to play in
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Nice story, that really hooks you up until the end. My favorite is the first book. Enjoyed the trilogy very much althought the end is not the happiest. It´s hard to start on a new book now because no one is that interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|hi there if you are looking for some fun then get this app and I am the appcritic and that is my saying
B001IF252M|5.0|Does what i need it to. clear picture. small. easy to keep plugged it at all times.  good for mac mini
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Excellent, as are all of Jodi Picoult's books.  Each is so different.  I enjoy her style of writing and can't wait to read another.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Chose 5 star because I liked it.Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool.best book ever.I read it rather easily
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Not sure why this book was so popular I think like me a lot of people were just curious to see how the story developed.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My daughter loves this movie!!!  It teaches some good valuable lessons as well.  Lots of singing and color...Just love it!
B0057XMCLA|2.0|I have been listening to the books on Audible, and I really find the entertaining and the story fascinating. This movie however changes the book way too much and loses as lot of the details that make it a great story.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. I think most of us can relate the characters in this story.  It's a sad story but I think also a common situation where not everyone fits into a certain group.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am glad to have this copy on hand.  I really like the movie.  Loved Richard Armitage in his role here.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Not sure why I bothered to buy this it was all too much of the same old stuff and became boring in the end would not bother to read any more of these books
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Being a horror film freak, this show is perfect for me. It has great effects, a good amount of gore, a great cast of characters, and the perfect feeling of dread. BUT the show reeeeaaaallly drags out its story line, getting less done in sixteen episodes than most shows get done in two or three.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is great gives you everything you need at your fingertips.<br />Great for all your travel and outdoor activities.......
0316056871|5.0|Tina Fey's life story is very interesting and told in a very funny way.  It's a great book for 30 Rock fans who want to find out more about this comedienne.
B009G78EE2|5.0|A CD comes along that you think, crossing fingers... I hope I like it... I just threw some money at this only after hearing only one song from them! Crazy good! I mean something that grows on you with each listen and I keep going back to it. Love this CD. The lyrics and the music are harmonious and symbiotic and thoughtful. Great thought went into this and it's magic and it paid off. I am definitely going to work back in time through additional purchases. Thanks guys and keep it up!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|5<br />Great book. I love this,book you people who are thinking about reading this you buy it on the kindle
0723257639|5.0|I bought this as a gift - an heirloom gift for a first birthday, for a friend to eventually give to her child. I read these stories growing up, and they're such classics.  This is such a great, special gift to give....one that is unique and will always be cherished.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|You can't beat Playmobil! Kids always love the different parts that come on and off.  They play for hours. Great toy.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I am not sure why this move has such good reviews.  There are several parts that didn't hold our kids' interest, and I found myself wanting to fall asleep.  Parts of the movie were very fun, but about half of it was not.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Great movie my husband watched it 3 times. It was here within days of ordering and was in perfect shape.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this book. All three of them. Kind of sad they are done. They are a must read. Wish there were more.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is a great doll.  My daughter received this for Christmas.  It is very cute, soft, and high-quality.  She smells wonderful, and my daughter is really growing to love this doll. Worth the higher price tag.
0395389496|5.0|This is a terrific book! Destined to be a classic someday.  I have used it repeatedly as a gift for children
0143119680|5.0|This was a very good story, and can't wait for the second one Shadow of Night to come, I pre-ordered it as soon as I finished the Discovery of Witches, a lot of action that builds in each chapter. good read.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|An older movie but it's an awesome action movie! Russell Crowe was a great actor in this film. I bought it for my boy friend because he still had in on VHS and it's time to replace it.  I will buy again soon!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I really like this because I cosplay and when making a cosplay it helps me know what I need to get and stuff!
B0017VT5E8|5.0|Hands down the best of the series. This is a truly wonderful movie for boxing and non boxing fans alike.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|In my opinion, i thought this game was really really really scary!!!!!!!! I honestly don't think I've ever played a game as scary as this!!!!! But that's just my opinion!!!! But, very good game!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|got hooked on this series from my mother-in-law.  I didn't really think it would be something i'd like a lot - boy was I wrong.  it sucks you right in!  watched seasons one & two on Netflix & Hulu and then bought season three from here.
B002E01LL6|4.0|Always a fan of Channing Tatum, I have not opened it yet but already seen some part of the movie. Just wanted to collect more action movies as well.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Who could ask for more. It is the first thing I check every morning!!! For those who suffer allergies checking the 'In Season' button tells you why your allergies may be plaguing you a bit more today than other days ! Very useful to know!.  And when you have nothing to do check out the delightful 'iWitness' with lovely and sometime hilarious pictures of our pets.If you're inclined to be social there's the 'Social button' where you can  post messages. The 'Severe' button informs us of bad weather like hurricanes coming our way and then we have the 'map button' that tells us where we live, in case we forgot. And all of this from the Weather Channel. Lovely!!<br />.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Gave one to my son as a gift he loves it so I bought it for me too good price for the full set and all in blu ray.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|Fabulously funny.  If you love wildlife, and secretly want them to win the battle with development, then this is the movie for you!  I loved it so much I ordered a bunch for next year's Christmas presents for all my animal loving friends and coworkers.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the most consistent show on television. The score is near perfection; the cast is flawless; the writing is fantastic. What more can I say? Buy season 1 and then season 2. I promise, you will not be disappointed.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|I found this a  very solid history lesson with a great cast and realistic production/ dress of that  period..  .
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I read a lot of reviews about different versions of the MicroShell and decided on this version. It was a wise choice! I LOVE the Marware MicroShell!! It is extremely light, durable, sleek and easy to use. You can use the front cover (flipped to the back) as a stand, as shown in the picture and it works really well. I have used the stand even in bed and it works extremely well!<br /><br />It is an all around great product and I will purchase more Marware products in the future! Bravo!
B004GEB9UQ|3.0|The Paleo Diet book isa informative and I agree with the diet principles but I like the Primal Blueprint better.
B00BOLFRKW|4.0|Anticipated seeing this movie for some time. While I enjoyed it, I felt it missed being as great as I had hoped. Acting, cinematography, soundtrack, all fantastic. The story however left you wishing for more.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Wonderful writing and beautifuly complex story. Its been a real pleasure to read such a well written fantasy book.<br />The story starts slowly but builds up.to a breath taking ending. Cant wait to start the next book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has a fabulous plot, execution, and cast of actors.  I look forward to each episode with bated breath.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|The product was perfect and it arrived before the date given..... it was a sequel to what I already had.  Thanks
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is such a classic movie.  We bought it to be a part of our dvd library.  We love this movie and watch it every Christmas.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the display of colors and the ability to move this cube in many directions in order to achieve the successful removable of the tiles.  It is challenging yet fun and not boring at all.  If you like the Mah Jong games, you will really love this.
0811879542|5.0|My granddaughter and I love this book. Sheis just learning to read, but she reads the pictures. We've read it so many times but she gets excited to know what will be on the next page with those dots.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|those who love match three games would love this one. not really easy but not too difficult either. hours of fun!!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is a very good movie and all my grandkids love to watch it over and over.  Has some language that I think they should have left out but overall it is a good movie.
B008J34466|5.0|I thought it might be hard for Pink to put out something equally good to \\"Funhouse\\", but she has more than pulled it off with \\"The Truth About Love\\".  There are some songs on this album, specifically \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" that I simply cannot get enough of.  That is one of those songs that just reached into my soul ... that doesn't happen very often, but when it does that song becomes a forever favorite of mine.  My favorite songs on the album are, of course \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" and the ballads \\"Beam Me Up\\" (which is a beautiful song no matter what, but especially touching for any of us who has had someone we love pass away) and \\"The Great Escape\\".  There are also several of the fun, rockin' songs that we have become accustomed to from Pink.  I dare anyone to listen to \\"The Truth About Love\\" and not dance or wiggle, at least a little bit!  I could go on about this album but suggest that you check it out for yourself.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is in the line of Tetris copies. One nice thing is that you are achieving not only time awards, but you are seeing the world. It is quite original in this vane. I think most people will be entertain by this game. I enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I highly recommend this series!  It has become a family event with everyone watching and discussing!  Looking forward to Season 4
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I can honestly say I've never seen a movie by James Cameron that wasn't great.  But Avatar is far and away the best work he's ever done.  The ground breaking technology he used to make this movie a reality has raised the bar several notches, setting a new standard for movie makers to strive for.  It was stunning and mind blowing in the theater when it was released, and now that you can do the director's cut in 3D at home with this version, it is even better.  There is a sequel in the works, and I predict it will surpass this one.  This rates a 10 star but they only let me give it 5!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game!  Glad I spotted it on Amazon. Loved it so much got it for all the other devices too and got the family hooked! Thanks Amazon :)
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|I'm going to join the hated ranks of people who gave this book a bad review. Obligatory disclaimer: Dugard's story is a harrowing one, and she deserves nothing but understanding and sympathy.<br /><br />This book is so poorly written, it's a joke. It is horribly repetitive, vague and disjointed, and does not focus at all on what most readers would consider the most significant details of her ordeal. In particular, little insider specifics are given about how the Garridos managed to keep Dugard and her two young daughters a secret for so long. Little description is given about how she and her children spent their days. Conversely, far too much is said about the pets they cared for.  It's pretty much just the introverted ramblings of what is essentially a 30-something-year-old child.<br /><br />The fault here is with the publishers, who wanted to strike while the iron was hottest, and knew that her book would sell as long as it had her name on the front, but would sell far better if it made it to press while public interest was at its peak. With a ghostwriter and editors to guide the narrative and present it in a more sophisticated manner, this could have been one of the most compelling autobiographies of a generation. Instead, it leaves you bored, guilty for being bored, and thirsting for the detail that only Jaycee Dugard can provide.

B00BWGISB4|4.0|I caught snippets of Remix on Headline News the other day and decided to listen to the samples here on Amazon. I am hooked. Expect the song Crash to be in your zumba class! But I do have to say, they really ought to let just Jordan handle the lead vocals. Donnie is really good at the beefier tones and Joey can be okay but too often they have him really try go full force but he's lacking the vocal ability to nail it. Let's Go Out With a Bang, the hidden track linked to Survive You, is a great song and would very likely be a hit.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book to help Chris Kyle's Foundation. I wasn't expecting it to be as good a read as it is. As a woman, I prefer love stories, not war stories.  But This is a Love Story. It's an honest love story told by a country boy who loved his country, his fellow soldiers and his family back home who long for him and want him back home safe and in one piece, physically and mentally.  It's the love story of our time.
B005OL9EEI|4.0|satisfied !!! product was very enjoyable !!! i would recommend this to any true star blazers fan !!! you are going to love it !!!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|We had made it to level 52 and then the new update came up. I updated to the new version and three days late the entire zoo went back to level one!!! We had just bought two easter bunnies and were breeding them, just bought a platypus, and panda bear and the next time we turned it on to see the zoo it had gone back to level 1. Very disappointing after all the money wehad spent and we were looking forward to finding dinosaurs, unfortunately now that won't happen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really am happy I got this app. So far it is working really well letting me see what the weather is like through out the day. I have not yet used the extended portions yet, but I have every confidence that will be just as good. Thank you for this.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Even though this trilogy is geared toward young adults and I am a senior, I truly enjoy it.  I am in the third book right now, and I'll be sorry when I finish it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Edge of your seat exciting.  Intense, even though we already know that it worked out in the end.  Frightening.  Knowing that it was a real event that happened in our lifetimes makes it even more intense.
076421120X|5.0|[*Note: This is a review of the book, not the music album.]<br /><br />The most critical part about being a worship leader is not simply being musically talented, or having a stage presence. Neither is it being a professional musician or a perfect choreographer. It is worship. A worship leader is first and foremost a worshiper. A worshiper is one who is close or desires greatly to draw close to God, as often as possible. Daily devotions is a great way to cultivate that sense of God's presence. Darlene Zschech, a world famous worship leader, who has written powerful hits like \\"Shout the the Lord,\\" \\"Power of Your Love,\\" \\"The Potter's Hand,\\" and many others, has shared the inner source of her strength: Devotion to Jesus. She longs for this book to encourage readers to worship Jesus \\"with every fiber of your being.\\"  In this book, Zschech demonstrates that worship is a 365 days commitment, every day of the year, to reveal Jesus. Twelve themes are broadly explored. Through her personal journey, she reflects upon God's faithfulness, holiness, power and might, Savior and Lord. The careful reader will note that there is a thematic movement of the works of Christ toward the Person of Christ. Revealing Jesus is a gradual awareness that God is not distant but near. God is working in the lives of others as well as ours. God has spoken in history and is speaking now.<br /><br />Each day begins with a Scripture verse followed by a short personal devotion, a classic hymn, lyrics of a song, and ends with a brief personal prayer. It honours special days in the Christian Church calendar like Resurrection Day, Christmas, and Lent. The devotional allows readers to observe significant seasons like Lent and Christmastide. There are periods of contemplation and encouragement. There are also many acknowledgements of our own weaknesses and doubts. One particular area I appreciate is how Zschech dedicates the second part of the month of August toward meditation on the names of God. She leads readers to worship and to lift up the attributes of God through the different Hebrew renditions. The author weaves through the whole devotional other themes like God as the Shield and Rock, God as the Gate, the Savior, the Redeemer, the Risen One, the Bread of Life, God of Peace, Friend of Sinner, and many more.<br /><br />Zschech is also a worship pastor, and this book in a way can be used by worship leaders in their churches to allow the music and songs be complemented by a meditative Bible reading and a brief devotional. Read a snippet or a page. Pray a sentence or pause for a moment of silence. The words allow leaders to invite their people toward a gentle reflection of God himself, through the use of Scripture and the devotional. Zschech has written a simple guide that is gentle to the heart, to bring hope to the down and out, and to direct attention more toward Jesus. If this book can help anyone see Jesus more clearly or more personally, to me, that will be worth every penny you spend. Indeed, worship need not be restricted only to lyrics and song. Worship can be channeled through words, through devotional, through prayer, and any movement of the heart that desires to see Jesus revealed and glorified more and more.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.<br /><br />conrade<br />This book is provided to me free by Bethany House Publishers without any obligation for a positive review.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this one is better than the first temple run there are different characters more obstacles on the course:p
B0091REZMW|4.0|the. searches. are so fun the maid must be on vacation. clothes on floors trash turned over very spooky walking Thurs the rooms
B000MR1V22|5.0|Excellent, funny family movie.  Not for little ones due to some adult situations.  Reflects reality within some families.  Not everyone is perfect!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Definitely an enjoyable series. Very suspenseful seems like your always on the edge of your seat. The life of rich people!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Excellent read. The author puts you into the story and keeps you there. I would definitely recommend this book to my reading friends.
B004U8VQEC|4.0|I originally saw this movie (twice) in an IMAX theater in 3D.  This gets 4 stars because it doesn't have as much impact and I'm comparing the two in my head no matter how hard I try not to.<br /><br />If you love space footage, you'll get it.  You get to see the astronauts completing EVAs to fix Hubble and it feels like you're there.  I've always wanted to go into space, so this part was interesting and exciting for me vs other people who completed reviews out here and were bored by that footage.  The enlarged images from Hubble that are used in the movie are amazing and hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />The voice over by Leonard Dicaprio is unobtrusive.  You hear him, and don't think about it being his voice, unlike other movies where the actors voice can become distracting.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie.  Better in the IMAX and in 3D, but still really fun to watch if you love space exploration and are pining for the days of live feeds from NASA during shuttle missions.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I thought the movie was just average.  A lot of hype.  I will watch movies over and over if I really like them, however, don't think I will rewatch this one.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This simple calculator app is big and easy to use. The key pad is clear and comfortable to use frequently.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Fun game without ads and minimal opportunities to spend real money. My 3-year-old can play on her own. Very intuitive and cute.
B007RFBLDG|5.0|I think people love or hate Will Ferrell.  I'm one who absolutely loves his silly ridiculous comedy style.  Also, a big fan of Molly Shannon from her SNL days and particularly this character.  Very, very entertaining movie and Molly Shannon made me laugh out loud.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I got this show on Kindle mainly because I didn't understand why everyone was so very excited about Benedict Cumberbatch playing the bad guy in the upcoming Star Trek movie. Hadn't seen any of his previous work. So I got this (it was free!) and now I know. He's riveting to watch. Martin Freeman is aces as well. Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like how I can play at my own pace and I don't. have to pay for anything. if I don't want to.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Super romantic ...... loved the idea that when it's right it's right and nothing can stop it.... very fairy tale
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|The movie is 5 stars.<br /><br />Both the blueray and the dvd are great.  The Digital Download is misleading.  Amazon does not download a copy, only allow to view it by streaming.  That is not a download.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very courageous and soul searching adventures.<br />Makes you wonder about what's truly important in this journey we call life. Thanks Cheryl
0385349831|5.0|The book has been my companion for many nights. I'm reading it for the second time and, this time, the paragraphs which called my attention are not the same. Truth is there are very subtle lessons to be learned in the Manuscript. One of the best, for me, is about finding (or looking for) your true friends among people who are convinced of what they are and of what they do in their lives. I'm personally frustrated with friends who put lots of expectations on what you can do for them instead. Again, Coelho has the power to touch my heart, with very simple words.
B005I1AQ14|5.0|I love this movie and when I went searching for it on DVD found the studio has not released it in a format usable in the USA, only PAL format for region 2 (Europe). This is one of my all time favorite movies because of the plot, characters (especially Edgar and Virginia Madsen), and incredible music!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I laughed. I cried. I cried some more. This book is AMAZING. There are no words to do it justice, unfortunately. College Hoover hypnotized me with her story until the end, and kept me guessing until the end. The writing is spectacular, and she is a genius storyteller. This is one of the few books I will treasure forever, get a hard copy of, and read over and over again. Highly recommended read!
B005723JSQ|4.0|novel for the cell phone generation with an interesting twist on the boy meets girl story. i enjoyed reading it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this wonderful game. When ever I am bored I just turn on my kindle and play. It is very useful for when you have to wait a while.
B00447G2MK|5.0|When this CD came, it was like it was fresh out of the wrapping, kind of like buying a CD at target, only cheaper.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Characeters go through life changes, They fight through the pain and agony of the past and find themselves able to love themselves and then others.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good little read. It made me a little crazy though! I kept worrying that I would wake up and had forgotten everything! It has a good, if not a little implausible, twist at the end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Follow the life and times of the greatest sniper in American history. It details his training as well as his feelings about killing the &#34;bad&#34; guys. It gives us a better understanding of what our military heroes go through during war times.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Brand new and i listened to it right when i got it. Added it straight to my phone and computer.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This came with a miniature of Robby and lobby cards for both films. The films, special features, and extras make it worth what I paid. The tin box opens on both sides but is flimsy but since I am not worried about the collectibility or displaying this is not an issue.
1419702238|5.0|I'm happy with it, it was the only book in the series I didn't have yet, so got it to complete my little girl's collection. It was hard cover, so it will stand up to most abuse. Not that my little girl is rough with her belongings, I'm just saying it arrived in great condition, so even if the post office were to be rough with the packaging the book would probably withstand it, allowing you to receive it in perfect condition. There's nothing really bad about this purchase. I didn't read the book or anything and it's not my place to criticize how good or bad the story inside is, as that doesn't matter here anyway. The people only want to know that the book arrived in the condition they expect it for being a brand new book, of which I can honestly say.... It did. :)
B003IWRE3I|4.0|It was real cool, i liked the movie and i like the book. 4 stars for sure. It was dope.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Cd was almost brand new, only way you knew it wasn't new was there was no plastic seal, but for used, that is great.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|I  missed this movie while it was playing in the theater but it was on my watch list. I finally bought the Blu Ray and I can honestly say that this is a great movie. Good characters, especially Anne Hathaway's and Jake Gyllenhaal's. An interesting story and the interplay between the two main characters was extremely entertaining. I thoroughly recommend this movie, check it out.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I chose this book to use at a mother-daughter church event. This proved to be a great success as we shared and laughed at some of the crazy things we have learned for each generation thinking the other has it better. The moms had shared things about their moms as well as their daughters and vice-versa. It was a fun and bonding day.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This was a cute story, with plenty of action. Our boys - 6 and 7 - enjoyed it very much, as did our neighbor's son, 8. We'll watch it again, and we may even purchase the DVD for our home collection. Definitely worth renting.
0812550706|5.0|This book is such a good work. It is definitely sci-fi, but you don't have to be obsessed with star wars to see its worth. Great for children and adults!
B00646UU5Y|5.0|I am a big fan of this series which I first discovered a few years ago while watching BBC America on demand. I highly recommend this series, the first 4 seasons are available on Amazon Prime for free, I bought season 5 to see the latest and greatest. Check out the first season and go on from there!
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|He is big and tall and blonde. More like the character in the books. He was so good in Thor.
0525478817|5.0|I am a person who never cries during a book , but in this one I was literally bawling so much. I am a teen and if you are too you should for sure buy this book.The fault in our starts has an amazing meaning to it even though so sad. This is such an amazing story including comedy,romance, and it is also very emotional. This book really draws you into reading and its a book that you  cant put down. Its has 313 pages and i finished it in 3 days. I cant describe how much I loved this book. Its is such a beautiful story that I will never forget about.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|There is nothing so interesting as a story told by someone who enthusiastically conveys it, with passion enough to make clear they believe in the tale about topics on which they are possessed of experience both deep and wide.<br /><br />This, is such a story.
B000OT6UZQ|4.0|This is another film I bought because Sarah Michelle Gellar was in it. It was kind of interesting and a little disconcerting to see her play such a heartless bitch but she plays it well. This movie is dark humor at it's best with cynical manipulative main characters especially Sarah's! It's not for everyone but if you were a fan of the movie &#34;Heathers&#34; then you would undoubtedly like this one as well.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|We purchased this to assist with our night vision camera and IR lights for our paranormal group.  I was a bit hesitant after a few of the reviews however I have to say that I am very impressed with the quality and adaptability of this product.  Of course I can't comment as to the durability however it seems solid and well constructed and I am confident that with proper care it will last as expected. I was easily able to configure it to work with our existing light bar and video camera.  All in all, I'm very pleased and believe that it is deserving of the 5-star rating I gave it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The only critique I have is that some of the shows are too dark.  Besides that, I love the series.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What an amazing love story! So full of humor & fun... Mixed w/ undeniable love and heartache! Makes this one of the most unique stories ever written!<br />A must read... Don't miss this great ride! I'll bet you on it! Awesome!
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Even though i'm a guy, I think I'm in love - I can't stop listening to this CD.I listen to it all the time. Love love love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love the book read the trilogy 7times great writing and very interesting you can't stop reading them again love it.
B00190N4E4|2.0|I am of mixed feeling about this movie.  On one hand, they did a good job on much of the material.  On the other hand, they left out some really significant parts of his life.  Notably absent were the following:<br />1.  His life as a pedophile.  None of his well-documented perversions with girls as you as 9 or 10 years were included.  Also not included is how he discouraged (or even forbade) his followers from engaging in intimate relations with their spouses, while he himself was sleeping naked with his 18 year old niece, and insisting she be naked as well.<br />2.  His antipathy to the Jews during the holocaust and in the years immediately following the holocaust.  There is no exploration of statements that could be understood to rebuke the Jews for not going more willingly into the furnaces of the Third Reich.  There is also no discussion of why he considered Hitler to be a friend.<br />3.  His deep-seated racism.  Again, there was no exploration of his strong support for the Indian caste system that denied opportunity and justice to hundreds of millions of Indians based solely on their birth.  In addition his feeling toward Africans was well know, demonstrated by quotes such as, \\"\\"We believe as much in the purity of race as we think they do. ... We believe also that the white race of South Africa should be the predominating race.\\"  This was completely ignored.<br /><br />Based on those omissions, I cannot give this above 2 stars.
B0087HT36U|1.0|It was, until it just stopped working. Now starting it up just causes it to crash after a few seconds.<br /><br />No, it's not an original game, and the android version made some levels impossible due to timing issues that were not fully tested. It's a shame, the game had potential to stand out from the other bird clones, but instead of doing that, mini clip was content to make a poor game and not even support it when a forced update made the game stop working.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was very enjoyable.  The author developed the characters well and the story line had enough twists and turns to be unpredictable.  I look forward to her future books.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|well my litles princes love this kind of movies. i like the quality and i like cuz work better than next flix
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really good read.  One of those that you don't want to stop reading to make dinner for the family... just toss them microwave meals.  It keeps you hooked thru the whole thing. The story continues to develop with every page.  The characters all play a significant part to the story.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was a cute little game. I bought it for my son to play on his tablet. It kept him busy and quiet the entire car ride. Not very challenging but very fun.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Title says it all. There are probably more comments on this movie now and my addition will provide little more to the discourse. I'd just like to point out that this movie's humor isn't a long running version of a Family Guy episode. Seth does a great job and Mark makes this movie worth watching over and over. If you're a child of the 80's then the cultural references and jokes will keep this movie at the front of your collection.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Another Peter Jackson movie about walking...terrible in every way. That said, if you like weird little people who sing and dance while they do the dishes and fight monsters without ever being in any real danger at all then this is for you. There are so many unrealistic scenes where our merry band of warriors should have died, yet somehow come out unscathed and smiling, that you lose interest almost immediately. If none of the main characters can ever get hurt, then why should I care when they roll into battle? Also if I was hanging out with the Wizard I'd be pretty upset that despite being all powerful he never uses his magic, or if he does he does so half way. Many others have commented on the eagles and why they didn't just fly them the whole way so I'll leave that alone, but do your self a favor and avoid this...unless you suffer from insomnia, then there is a good chance this film will cure your ills.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Nathan Fillion has the best expresions and they all have very witty lines. This isn't supposed to be CSI. They are murder mysteries but wrapped up in humor. It is very funny. I adore Espezito (spelling?) and Ryan. And Martha and Alexis and Kate. It is a joy to watch. My family and I love this show! :D
B004J4WLB4|3.0|There were several intense parts like the birth of Hazel and Victoria's first days with her that I found very disturbing .  In the beginning the switching back from past to present was very,very, confusing.
B004XISI4A|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series but as much as I enjoyed reading the other books I hated the ending in this book
B000JBWWBK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite chick flicks, Russell Crow is so yummy in this lead role as is the whole cast wonderfully done , the french countryside is so relaxing to watch and storyine has the life-lessons that one would hope to get right before all is said and done. a couple of pleasant story twists revealed about the past and the ending  is where we all want to be...
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I liked the movie , it's the basic good against evil , and finding out that there is good in all of us if we choose to utilize that part of ourselves
B004GJYROG|4.0|I was around 8 when this movie came out, and I bought it for a bit of nostalgia. Well worth the small price for a piece of my childhood!
B0050AV5MW|4.0|I loved reading this series although there were times when the author seemed to get too bogged down in minutae and lost me a little. Wished I hadnt then gone on to read book 5 which has a dismal ending.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I originally saw this on tv and just had to own it .Jude Law with Cameron Diaz is very believable and sexy together.Kate Winslet has a two part,her relationship with Eli Wallach is just terrific and such a growing experience for both.then her relationship with Jack Black which at first seems unlikely but blossoms nicely jude's little girls are so adorable, The cast is dreamy and the idea of house swapping is just too much fun, so different worlds totally, o to be that daring and have such a great reward.The greated the risk the greater the reward isn't that what they say?
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The movie was too long and to slow , but that is the story that was written they left out some things that would have made it better in the movie
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|This was the first album of Ellie's that I purchased. I liked her Lights hit so decided to buy and got so much more! This album rox my sox with it's synthpop sounds and empowered lyrics, I am still listening to it since day one. I bought her other albums after hearing this one and enjoy them all, but Halcyon wins which keeps me anticipating for more! Ellie keeps me singing and dancing and feeling good all over.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books and this one is up there with all the others.<br />Why only 4 stars when Im such a fan I think the author has hit on a formula that really works but I would like to see Jack do something unexpected for once.
B0042816YK|5.0|This movie is my current favorite and I refer back to it when I just want to be alone darlings!!!  Some of the life lessons and world travel make it visually lovely.The cast is fabulous.Julia Roberts and Javier are very appealing as their relationship grows and the challanges they face as they struggle to leave their life \\"baggage\\" behind and begin a new and more meaningful relationship. Highly recommend this movie
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We've been watching this from the beginning--great series--just wish that the author (Martin) would stop killing everybody (good or bad!).  My daughter-in-law wanted the complete series so I've been getting them for her as soon as they are on DVD.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun to play and easy to use. i spend hours playing this game. I really enjoy playing it
1423140605|5.0|This is a great book. A must read for all fans of rick riordan. It is really good and is action packed. I loved the humor and cute Percabeth reunion and scenes throughout the book. I also like how the new characters have made really good relationships with the older ones. I think that this is a good book. But if you can't stand cliffhangers then that might be a problem. I won't spoil anything but you just have to read this awesome book.
0375836675|5.0|This is another great story by Garth Stein.The storyline is so dark and twisty yet redeeming in the end.I can see why the younger crowd might love this in a school setting , much to be discussed by both sexes.Sent this book to my niece when she was finishing high school and she also loved it.We had a very lively discussion at our womens bookclub, so there is something for everyone...Hope you can figure it out...some of the women missed the end...
1419702238|5.0|My grandson collects all the Wimpy Kid books.  So as soon as one comes out, I add it to his collection.  He said this one was great.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got this app to compliment the same one I have on my cell phone. It works well and is easy to read and use.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I am pretty new to Jack Reacher and have read only 4-5 books.  This wasn't my favorite as the secondary characters were a bit confusing and difficult to embrace.  Having said that, every Lee Child book has me up late reading all night.  He tells a great story and Jack Reacher is interesting.  Everyone likes to see the good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve - and that certainly happens in this series; but Jack Reacher is also more complex that just a big tough guy action hero.  I am glad I discovered this series and look forward to more enjoyable nights.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This was a pleasnat suprise. Cast was teriffic and the interaction between the two main characters developes in such a fun way several different subplot interests of boy meets girl and girl meets boy, some are interested and other the same blow off thats been happening since dating, I really enjoyed this movie
1575666286|5.0|I am a total beliver that food is the best medicine. By reading this book and information through other sources, Gerson therapy has proven to have changed many people's life for the better. Charlotte Gerson offers generous information and detailed instruction how the therapy works. It's very helpful for me and for all who believe in alternative medicine. I will have no hesitation to recommend this book to anyone.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I got this App for my kindle so that I will always have a dictionary with me. It is fast and easy to use.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|My wife and I watch SciFi to get away and relax from everyday.  But most series today are too dark.<br />SGA has great stories but are fun at the same time.
B000MYFILK|3.0|I was not able to watch the full movie in one sitting, and when I went back to finish, it was no longer available on Amazon Prime. VERY FRUSTRATING
B009YQJ322|5.0|great movie!!  lot of action and cool special affects. suprised this movie not more popular. would love to see a sequel
B006X5L6VS|5.0|This app after you get use to is is easy to use and is fun to use. The only difficulty is that there is no GPS on my Kindle to get the best use from from it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game. The only problem would be you can only play until your energy is out. I can't figure out how to treat a friends horse either.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|I love Jonas Kaufmann's  singing, acting, intelligence, looks, and everything he does on and off stage, such as very informative and intelligent interviews about his casting, future  projects and so on.  He is at present the most versatile performer in his field.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I got this as i was having trouble with my wireless router and just didn't want to deal with a finicky network. i use it with my mac book air and it works great.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|I got this app for my kindle to allow me to take pictures from it. It works well and is easy to use
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game offers a collection of games. Its hive since they are all free to play with the exception of collecting points and using those for new games.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|You should totally watch it. Johnny Lee Miller is great as a damaged modern day Sherlock,  More &#34;person&#34; than the often compared to &#34;Sherlock&#34; from BBC, but we can love both, so long as we don't compare too much.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I hate this app it's a waste of your time! Don't get it, because it can and probably will give you a virus.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|GREAT, great and great.  Judi Dench is fantastic as usual.  Need I say more.  I so enjoyed the English countryside and the story is great.  Great buy.
B004MWI2M0|5.0|kids ordered this, they love it dont know what else to say except that it came fast and works great
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Not bad but not their best effort either. Disney's got a long way to go to get back to the level of quality they had before the great Eisner Animation Studio purges. This movie I'd rate higher than Bolt (by a long shot) but lower than Tangled.<br /><br />A lot of the videogame references and jokes felt forced and a bit ham-handed compared to the quality I've seen in Disney's &#34;Gravity Falls&#34; videogame parody episode (specifically referencing&#34;Fight Fighters&#34;.) And from what I saw on the extras in the Blu-Ray set, the creative team had to be dragged kicking and screaming back to the topic by John Lasseter at every turn. Considering the Disney Team was handed this outstanding idea on a silver platter by Lasseter and still missed a Grand Slam, they've got a lot of hard decisions and fat-trimming to do in their creative ranks.<br /><br />The voice actors did an okay job - could have chosen much better voice talents, it seemed as though the team went with John, Sarah, Jack and Jane solely for their popularity, sacrificing talent for common denomination appeal - a problem Dreamworks continually wrestles with.<br /><br />Overall I guess the reason I really loved this movie was Ed Wynn, or rather Alan Tudyk doing his best Ed Wynn impersonation as King Candy. Hard to believe enough time has passed that this generation actually has no idea King Candy is a caricature of one of the greatest Vaudeville comedians of the age. Both him, and the plot twist near the end really had me enjoying the ride.<br /><br />Bottom Line? Definitely give this movie a shot - If you're a VG fan you'll enjoy it a bit more than your average movie-goer, but don't expect more than surface level name-dropping and prop flashing jokes and for the typical Disney fan, the movie does not disappoint in the laughter and feel-good department. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome amazing fun it just is a really nice relaxation game but could you like maybe upgrade it so it has more games thanks
B00140PK6O|5.0|Judy Dench and the supporting actors are great.  Love the English countryside and the story is wonderful.  Great buy for Judi Dench lovers.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|anything twilight and im in love, im addicted and listen to this all the time and its worth it too
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I downloaded the entire album by mistake but I'm glad I did.  Great songs and excellent lyrics.  So glad I have it now.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game.it keeps u going.it's fun for me my kid's I'm lovin it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From the Lewis family
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I ordered this because I loved the series.  I intend on ordering the rest when they become available.  It is a very successful series and how could it not be?  The settings are wonderful, the costumes and houses beautiful.  So much for the eye to absorb.  Love it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. Starts slow but builds quickly. A bit of a learning curve with combat. Only downside is no offline mode. You can be attacked from much higher ranked players before you are ready.
B004Y042N8|5.0|This is one I play a few times just about every night.  When you make a mistake it screams at you . . . funny.  Quite enjoyable game and I'm glad I got it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to watch it. Absolutely loved them together and loved the scenery as well.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|Well, this is the second mini-controller I've tried for Android and iOS. Without boring you with all the fine details and an attempt to sound like I'm auditioning for a position at some tech magazine, here's the story:<br /><br />It's Okay.<br /><br />The Good: It connects to Bluetooth easily enough, doesn't require any special software (though it is optional), and feels relatively solid and well-constructed. Buttons all feel good, and sticks/d-pad are responsive enough for most games.<br /><br />The Bad: It's small. Too small, really. I get that this is for travel, but they really made it tiny and compact, and it's hard for an adult male with normal-sized hands to really get comfortable with it. The buttons are all too close together, and they're reversed from the normal Xbox/PS3 arrangement (the top and bottom button functions are swapped).<br /><br />The Ugly: On iOS it's almost useless, as most iOS games simply don't support it. On Android the game selection is better, but the closeness of the buttons makes even the best gamer feel a bit clumsy.<br /><br />Final verdict: Three stars for general build and quality. Plus one star for the versatility that allows it to work with just about any device that has Bluetooth, whether it be PC, Mac, iOS, or Android (I can't speak for Linux, unfortunately). That, and the fact that it doesn't require proprietary software to get any use out of it, makes it a notch better than the MOGA in regards to how useful and versatile it is. However, the MOGA has a nifty cradle that allows you to mount your device on it, and that balances things out a little. However, I'm docking a star for the outrageous price. It's simply not worth this much when there are other devices out there that can do this for a much lower price. Nothing about the SteelSeries Free makes me think it's worth eighty bucks (or even sixty-five bucks) at the time of this writing.<br /><br />If you're just using Android, you could go with this or the MOGA. If you're on anything outside of Android, you really should avoid the MOGA because it won't work and the SteelSeries Free will.<br /><br />So the final grade: Three stars. It could be higher if they'd be sane and drop the manufacturer's suggested retail price to under fifty bucks.<br /><br />UPDATE 2016:  Okay, so I dug the SteelSeries Free out and decided to give it a go on my current Android phone (Sony Xperia C5 Ultra) and I have to say the experience is MUCH better now that more games support Bluetooth controllers. Emulators are where this controller shines. It has 8 buttons, two analog sticks, and a d-pad, which is enough for most emulators. The d-pad is decent-feeling. Sadly, the sticks don't have press-to-click buttons in them.<br /><br />As a result of this controller holding up for years, and being much more useful with the new crop of Android phones and games, I have to bump up the review rating to four stars. It also helps that the price is more reasonable now (thirtyish bucks).<br /><br />If you're looking for a game controller to stick in your pocket, this is a good choice. I think it would benefit by having a little plastic case with a keychain connector, but it fits in a back pocket well enough, as long as you don't sit on it. Those sticks might not feel too good if you do.A because it won't work and the SteelSeries Free will.  So the final grade: Three stars. It could be higher if they'd be sane and drop the manufacturer's suggested retail price to under fifty bucks.

B009XWD02G|1.0|all it does is Poop all the time probably ate too many beans al the music is is toot toot toot and done do not buy looks licit but don't buy
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Except for the fact that all of the characters seemed too witty to be natural (think Juno), it didn't take more than a chapter to fall deeply in love with this novel.
086547897X|5.0|Excellent as a reference guide! It goes in-depth with explaining different methods and techniques to animation, as well as giving a brief history behind them and the studio(s) that developed them. Another feature is that it includes a ton of pages in the back for reference (walk cycles and so on) that are great to use if you've no idea where to start.<br /><br />I haven't finished reading the entire thing, but overall it is a very helpful book that is ideal for the novice animator and anyone interested in the field.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I love this movie.  Great price for the complete set too.  The pause menu info is also really cool for disney and video game fans.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Would highly recommend this movie if you are a history buff, wonderfully acted, you left the theater beleiving Daniel Day Lewis was Lincoln
B00456PKG4|4.0|I liked the premise of the movie, the plot and the story line but I  don't like snakes and it was way too many in this movie for me.  Of course, 1 is too many for me.  Good Movie if you don't mind the snakes.
B009G41CG2|5.0|love it easy to see on my Kendall ,i play it often ,tiles are easy to see, its a good game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading book 1 since it was free and it was recommended by a friend.  I instantly felt connected to the characters and found myself thinking about this book during any downtime during the day and dreaming about it at night.  The plot is well planned and leaves you always craving just a bit more.  Time to buy the Shift edition!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Awesome product!  Well designed.  Should have been included as original charger with the Nexus 10.  Samsung should take note of this great product.<br /><br />Only wish it was a full dock.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|All my friends told me to buy this game as soon as I got my kindle fire hd. I didn't because I don't like the thought of killing humanity with a horrible plague. Well after playing lots of other games and being bored after a few levels, I tried the free version of plague. Long story short this game is tons of fun and I should have listened to my friends. Buying extra DNA points is really worth it too.
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent!  Well done. I must be last one to read it, though 😊. Looking forward to more adventures with Robert Langdon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book love passion and sex all combined .... Christian grey is definitely my dream guy. Can't wait to read the last one :(
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I have never recieved this. Not really sure what happened with it. Any information would be helpful. Did I return this?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|enjoyed it.  cant wait for the next season to see what may happen to masters and servants at downton abbey.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had been so busy reading other things and I finally was able to read this. This was a beautifully written book I love it every step of the way the  Love the passion of Abby and Travis was amazing<br /> I can't wait yo read more from Jamie.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|After seeing a splendid review of How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You I knew I had to read the book and luckily I was able to score a copy of it through my library.<br /><br />I wasn't exactly sure what to expect but it certainly wasn't what I got. I thought I would be in for a comic that would have laughing hysterically given what so many people were saying about the book on Goodreads and Amazon.<br /><br />Too bad for me it wasn't as funny as I had hoped at all. The Comics were cute but weren't anything to write home about. I thought they were only mildly funny and I was greatly disappointed by that fact considering one of my favourite bloggers gave the book such a stellar review of it I found it to be bland and pretty stereotypical with the basic cat jokes.<br /><br />While it was a quick and easy read I just look at it as if it was just something to occupy my time in between reading novels. I wish I had liked the book more and I wish the material tied in with the title a lot more but it didn't which I found to be a little misleading.<br /><br />Overall, this was an okay read. Not bad but not Good. Apart from the occasional giggle I wasn't very entertained at all and I would only recommend this book to be read as a little novelty read for cat lovers in a stocking at Christmas.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Informative and well done!  Since it was based on actual events, I found it very informative,  I would watch it again.
B005PK553C|5.0|Really creative writing, great characters with believable tragic flaws. Exciting new horror revealed each episode. Highly recommend! Worth every penny!
B004XZR63M|2.0|Pros: good ideas about how to spend your money on things that produce more money, rather than spending it on things that end up costing you more.  Interesting anecdotes.<br /><br />Cons: ridiculous, unbelieveable dialogue, over-simplified ideas of how to make millions from just a few dollars, and hardly any specific information that can help you get going.<br /><br />This is a fast read and may provide some inspiration to change your financial habits, but you will certainly have to turn to other resources for vital information.  Plus, the author comes away (in my view) as a rather unscrupulous scammer, advocating not paying your bills on time and taking advantage of friends to make a few bucks.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|great gift!<br />if you love movie you must get this!<br />great soundtrack!<br />would buy again!<br />I I I  loved it!
B00BVYN5II|5.0|Ragnar may be the most arrogant character created this decade, and yet, Travis Fimmel plays it so well you love him for it! Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick)... FINALLY A female character who is both strong, and feminine, a warrior women can look up to ... and Gabriel Byrne as the Earl shines, as always!<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about this show. Others have said the show is historically accurate. Not being an expert on Viking history, I bow to their greater Expertise.<br /><br />What makes this show amazing (beyond the superior acting, script writing, action scenes, and beautiful camera work) is the Characters. They play true to the watcher. We understand their motivations, their decisions in the context of their culture and time period. We identify with their ambitions, fears, joys and worries.<br /><br />And I repeat, I am especially impressed with the way the writers have handled the character of Lagertha, Shield Maiden. It's the first time, in my memory, a woman has been portrayed as a True Warrior. It's the first time I've seen a female warrior wearing practical, warrior-like clothing instead of a leather or metal corsette or bra. Lagertha Is a Viking Warrior and she not only makes no apology for it, she revels in her role as both Fierce Mother and Shield Maiden who is fighting for the glory and riches of her family as she understands it in the context of her culture. Thank you so much for not turning her into another Pretend Warrior Sex Object there for the amusement of adolescent males who care more about cleavage than character.<br /><br />**Side Note: To the Prudes who have a problem with people having sex, try to remember, none of us would be here if your parents hadn't had sex. For many thousands of years, Sex was considered a very natural and integral part of life that adults did not feel the need to be ashamed of or hide from children--there is nothing shameful in the act of love and procreation. To leave out that very natural and integral part of the daily life our ancestors would be both insulting and DECEITFUL. If you don't want to know about sex, and don't want your children to know about it....well, hopefully not knowing about it will keep you from breeding and subjecting the rest of us to your long outmoded ignorance.
B008MM9630|4.0|I love the game but the last 5 or more days I am no longer seeing the left hand corner special promotion deals.  I don't know how to get them back in my game play and it's hard/impossible to contact game support.  Would like the game more if that error clears I really wanted that rainbow peacock.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|&#34;Child 44&#34; and its sequels - &#34;The Secret Speech&#34; and &#34;Agent 6&#34; brim with historical fact and are impossible to put down.
B0026PW67W|3.0|My nephew is enjoying it for now.<br />Although a collectors item (so I am told) I thought it was too expensive for what it was - paper!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Product dident work from the start. Its a gamble product and a disposable one at that. Only count on a couple shoots as it feels quite cheep to star.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very realistic game.I am really enjoying this game and I recommend this game to many horse lovers
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Every song is great but Bruises is my all time favorite.  There is just something about that song that makes you want to sing along.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Good day to all,<br />Last time i wrote a summary of the previous book it was titled by some as a &#34;spoiler alert&#34;. So I will be succinct in this one. Overall a fitting resolution to so many storylines. Well written and looking forward to the next book.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|No need to explain. You should already know if you seen the first season. Now just pre order the next season while you're at it. :D
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This game is fun and addicting. There is too much have to pay Dlc,It's still a great game. Buy it
B007HO392S|4.0|Best Carrie Underwood album of them all.  Two Black Cadillacs is one of those songs that you find yourself wanting to sing along with it.
030726999X|5.0|One word sums it up &#34;awesome&#34; well written and God Bless the authors soul for such a well written trilogy.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I had to have this after my wife erroneously bought me the first season special edition on blu ray (didn't have a blu ray player at the time).  So naturally I had to get season 2 in the same.  I waited a while for a good price as this is hard to find but as I am a crazy fan and got it for a 'reasonable' price relatively speaking.  It's limited, it's cool.  People comment on it when they see it.  It scares the crap out of you when you forget it's there sometimes.  My wife still hasn't adjusted ;).  Not to mention the bonus featurettes.  There's a pretty cool alternate season 2 opener that's worth a look.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is an awesome game and it is the best game that I have ever played in my hole life of video games
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Zac Brown and group give it all they got and the beat gets you feeling good.  All of the songs can be number 1 hits.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Very good movie with great special effects. I can't wait for the other two movies to come out. Gotta love the Hobbits.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The show has realistic characters that you want to follow, amazing writing, and is unlike most of the legal shows on TV today.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like this alarm. It doesn't have a whole lot of stuff for free, but it does exactly what it's supposed to, it wakes me up. It has different sounds, but if you want your own music you'll have to upgrade. I also like the how you can change the snooze timer, because sometimes you need a couple extra minutes. And my other perk is the multiple alarms, they don't mess with each other and you don't have to worry about shutting all off by accident. It's a good free alarm, the best I've found (so far).
B0027MJU00|5.0|My favorite of all her books I have read. Had the suspense that I like and didn't expect the ending!!
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have all of the available seasons for Criminal Minds. I watch it every Wed. plus all the reruns I can find.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to get to number 3!!!!! Wish there would be another one!!!!.. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Music is fabulous. A new flavour in classical instrument music making infused with technology. Great music to soothe the mind at anytime of the day.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Minor spoilers<br /><br />Sometimes I can grow impatient with trying to weave together these chapter story lines that take a while to come together. Just when Anderson gets interesting I've got to read about a less interesting factory manager. We don't even meet the windup girl until several chapters in. The book's not really about her and she's not the main character.<br /><br />After a few cycles of the individual stories I got into it and enjoyed it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This Batman triolgy is more for adults than children. It was a great movie with Christian Bale. I love all 3 of them
B004EPZ02A|3.0|its ok, had some creepy moments but its getting very repetitive and making the series old.  Hopefully this is the last movie in the paranormal series, but I doubt it!
B00BF11STU|3.0|The film depends on the story to carry it. The torture scenes make you cringe and wonder but the rest of the film never grabs you.
1421550644|5.0|This is THE BEST MANGA I have ever read. If you are a fan of anime or manga or even studio ghibli. You owe it to yourself to expereince this timeless classic. The movie Nausicaa was only a small fraction of the actual story. This is the entire series in one collection. I have never read a more well realized epic in my life. This is the coillection we all were waiting for as fans of the author. Buy is now before it's too rare to afford.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|I love Michael Connelly, and I think they should make movies of a lot of his books. This a great movie with all the suprises.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app is always on. It will update a minimum of once an hour. No matter how you set it it will shorten battery life. That's why I only gave it3 stars, otherwise it would be a 5.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I got the feeling that this movie accurately reflected the clash and chaos that prevailed in much of Iran just before and after the Shah was deposed. An acquaintance of mine who had travelled to the Middle East during this period, showed me the dictionary she had had been given to help her translate from English to Farsi. The book had the usual section of \\"Commonly Used Phrases.\\" Next to the standard inquiries helping tourists find a bathroom and get something to eat, there appeared the presumably equally likely question of, \\"What time are the executions?\\"<br /><br />While the apparent need to know how to ask such a question in Iran seemed comical when viewed on the page - there was nothing comical about the reality. The atmosphere that made such a question standard is vividly captured in \\"Argo.\\" We see the tension, the cruelty, and the horror of those days.<br /><br />However, other aspects of \\"Argo\\" left me somewhat unsatisfied. We don't really get to know the people involved in this fictionalized account of the hostage rescue that took place at the end of the Carter administration and the beginning of the Reagan administration. There are too many individuals represented too briefly on the screen.<br /><br />John Goodman's character is one of the few whose personality does come through in this hectic barrage. Goodman performs the same role here that he performed in \\"Flight,\\" the almost simultaneously released movie. Goodman is again the lovably cocky go-to guy with a specialized talent. His skill at transforming people with make-up doesn't actually seem to be needed though. So ultimately, his character also gets overtaken by the quick-cut, fast-shuffle pace of the movie.<br /><br />The choppy briefness of each scene recalled the slapping blades of a helicopter - and so actually put me more in mind of the Viet Nam evacuations than of Iran rescues, although no helicopters were actually shown as being involved in this operation. Director Ben Affleck might have done well to learn from the appeal of movies such as \\"Fargo.\\" The Coen brothers aren't as relentlessly driven to \\"get on with it.\\" They understand the value of pausing for seemingly irrelevant anecdote about each of their characters. With \\"Argo\\" since we don't get to know the people involved, we don't care as much as we might have.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Argo\\" deserves a high rating for putting the viewer in the kind of heart-pounding, breath-catching situation that all the hostages, their rescuers, and many average citizens were in during this turbulence.
B004J64QSI|4.0|not real happy with Amazon Prime instant videos -they lock up and are hard to pause-<br /> but the show itself is amazing -
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|This was a great movie to kick off Sylvester Stallone's career. No one else could ever be Rocky like him.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I was a great movie for the people who enjoy westerns. The cast is great, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall. I hope they keep making great westerns with actors like these.
B008220DGE|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman turn in brilliant performances here. Phoenix is especially gripping as the kind of violent, priapic man who might seek to channel his socially unacceptable energies by becoming an adherent of and an enforcer for some cult-like movement.<br /><br />However I couldn't totally appreciate the performances because I kept trying to impose a more coherent narrative line on the action. Instead of the steadier chronology I felt this material called for, we get an oddly punctuated series of scenes that sometimes slip almost into the surreal.<br /><br />As a result, this isn't quite the story of how an inspirational speaker-become-ersatz religious leader might elaborate his meretricious philosophy and gain adherents; and it isn't quite a character study. It's an off-beat combination of the two.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with such memorable acting and such strangely hypnotic illumination of the ways of human attraction - \\"The Master\\" is bound to make you a devotee.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Seems to be a solid game for the kindle fire. I haven't had any issues with it as of yet. And it's quite fun
B009POCG2C|5.0|Very good heart warming movie. Clint Eastwood is good as the grumpy talent scout and Father. Very good family movie.
B00138KK62|5.0|Alicia is a class act - always enjoy seeing her perform. Album is a first purchase for my tablet.<br />I would recommend any work of hers.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I am so honored and blessed to hear about the SEALS. God's hand was obvious throughout the story. I recommend this book and talk about it a lot to everyone I know. Thanks so much for writing it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great story, with multiple human dimensions<br />A bit slow paced - I tried seeing it during workdays and stopped. Watched over holidays, was fascinated.<br />Great story-telling, weaving influential historical events - helps if you have an interest in British culture
B004SIP6A4|3.0|I'm not really in to the musicals, but as far as musicals go, it was pretty good. Great cast helped.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story was well crafted to allow the reader to feel it from three sides, which always makes a novel more captivating. I appreciated hearing the story from Kevin, as it so deeply illustrated the frightening and truly tragic lives of abusive people and substance abusers. While I had Jo figured out early on, it added a spiritual component that was truly touching. Great read!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I can see this movie being real, from the mother worring about what other's think, too the grils being spoiled and false.
B005LAII80|2.0|The original was very bad, this improves the plot slightly but not enough. Karl Urban tried too hard to come across as Stallone.
B009POCFTG|3.0|Really good movie with Matthew Mc Conaughey, a little different from his usual character, but good. He's a very talented actor.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This documentary is so touching.  It is a story of man living on the fringes after going for his dream and seemingly not succeeding, while a country also living on the fringes of apartheid found solace in his music.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|This story was riveting and kept me on the edge.  It was hard at first to read because each chapter goes from current time to past time. However, once you get past that, it's wonderful!  I would highly recommend it.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Although it depicts the negatives of real life, the message is for fathers to realize the importance of really being a father to their children and how much it impacts what happens to our sons and daughters if fathers fail to be involved and show their love.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Enjoyed very much. Would reccomend to any age group. The characters worked well with each other. Sorry I found it this late, but very glad I did.
B00486070K|2.0|This plug and play worked flawlessly for about 6 months with my MacBook air.  Then it started to work intermittently.  Then it stopped all together.  It was almost as if there was a loose connection.  When it was working intermittently, if I held it a certain way it would work in the USB port. Not very convenient to use one hand to hold the connector or to try to prop it up with something in a particular position. It seemed as if the short plastic sleeve covered wire was twisting in the sleeve and I can only assume that it broke or came loose from the USB connector end.  Anyway, it is in the trash now.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl makes some really good points about why we should be talking about gender issue publicly and does a great job encouraging reader to help women in workplace. I was also really impressed at all the stats she uses to support her arguments, many of which I didn't know about before. As a hiring manager myself, I definitely recommend this book as a must-read.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I read the book while vacationing at Hilton Head.  I could sit, listen to the surf while reading the book.  The movie couldn't take me back to the beach - that part of heaven on earth.

1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House will go down as one of my favorite books of all time. It was a joy to read and also a great audio book. I loved it!!! I hated for it to end! Loved the characters and felt a bond with each the two protagonist. Highly recommend!!!
014241493X|5.0|I loved this book. I'm glad I ordered it on a whim. It took me only a few days to read and I was completely hooked. John Green is a great author.
0857680986|5.0|I've heard nothing but great things about this book and it does not disappoint.  Truly amazing art instruction. Easy to understand and follow. The author really has a keen way of giving you the basics that are easy to follow and inspire you to want to draw.  The seller shipped in record time and I did not pay expedited shipping cost. Free shipping at a 5-8 day window and the book delivered in two.  I would purchase through this seller again.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Great movie with a crude image of the way politics work in this country. I recomend this one to everyone.
B00447L4KA|5.0|Perfect!  What can I say loved the movie then, love it now. The order was shipped and recieved very quickly.
B005DJGMQE|2.0|James McAvoy gives an inspired performance but can not save a rather impassioned story that drags on for two hours and leaves viewers unsatisfied.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|im trying to change all my movies over to blue ray, glad you had this one..plus when you have a lot of kids your movies tend to start disappearing.. thanks for your service..no issues here..
B0000X2EOW|3.0|I was quite pleased to see the additional content and the DVD were all in one piece and packaged nice and neat, but as soon as I opened the case it completely fell apart! Maybe try using a stronger glue to keep the cardboard case and the plastic innards together. Otherwise, no complaints.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a very great game you can ride in cars and go under fire but the bad thing is sometimes when you try to jump it won't let you but it's VERY fun
B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Michael Fassbender's performance of sex addict Brandon Sullivan is absolutely stunning, and I'm not just talking about his physical performance or his *ahem* physical assets. Fassbender effortlessly portrays the complex emotions required to showcase the pain Brandon feels at his inability to cope with the emotions he feels in his personal life. It truly was heartbreaking to watch Brandon struggle through his daily life trying to find a way to shift through the haze of emotions that he felt he wasn't equipped to deal with. Brandon's relationship with his troubled sister Sissy, brought to life by Carrie Mulligan, sheds more light into the reasons behind Brandon's obsessive need to keep his head filled with lust rather than focus on his present personal and family life. Overall just a stunning movie that paints a picture of an addiction that is not treated with the same respect and willingness to accept and help seek treatment as many other addictions are. Brilliant direction by Steve McQueen, brilliant script and story line and brilliant acting. Fantastic movie.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|man he is one of my favorite country singer,an this cd is awesome..4 of these songs could be number 1 an at least 5 could be top 10..im glad i got this cd..thanks for getting it to me on time..i have enjoyed it everyday i have gotten it.. thanks again..

B0067R0APK|3.0|Recently updated AccuWeather Platinum and I was disappointed that the moon faze has been removed.<br /><br /> Before the update this app was easy to use and gave you a visual of the weather on the opening page. That w a s what I liked which is lacking now. The weather forecast is pretty accurate. The app needs further work.
141659521X|5.0|What can I say but Vince Flynn is an amazing author. I don't know where he gets his sources but the stories captivate you. I hope he weaves in the bin Laden story in his next book, which I can't wait to read.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The acting, costume design and sets, and screenplay were excellent! I highly recommend this movie to movie lovers of any genre.
B009C5Z112|5.0|I found this as a suggested item while looking at some korpiklonni. I liked the sample so much i decided to buy this instead, and certainly haven't regretted it. Wintersun is EPIC. The music is good to start, and it just keeps growing on you. I liked this album so much I got the other album they have out and my ears still hunger for more.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Such potential but it was a total waste of about 2 hours that I will never get back. I kept watching because I thought it would get better, but when it was over it just put me in a bad mood.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I really love Game of Thrones, the acting is awesome. Every episode I watch makes me want more. I highly recommend it.
0375805621|3.0|Sadly, this book is not nearly as good as [[ASIN:037582913X The Monster at the End of this Book (Sesame Street) (Big Little Golden Book)]], which I enjoyed as a little girl. I bought it for my daughter and she loved it, (its one of her all time faves) and since she loves Elmo I decided to buy this one as well. She doesn't like it as much and neither do I. She brings her \\"monster book\\" to me all the time to read, but this one stays on the shelf. I thought for sure because of Elmo she'd be making me read it a hundred times a day, but not even a fuzzy red monster is enough to save this book. I feel like it was lazily put together and relied too much on what worked from the previous one. I would have liked to see a different story.<br /><br />I will say that I think these books are good for teaching kids to not be afraid of monsters or boogeymen. I went through phase When I was little I was scared of monsters in the closet, so I received the original story to read. When I got scared, my parents told me it was just Grover or Cookie Monster or whatever, and then I wasn't afraid anymore. My dad would peek in the closet and say, \\"Cookie Monster, Jordan is trying to sleep. Be quiet in there!\\" and I would feel much better. If my daughter ever goes through the same thing, I will probably try that with her.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I seams as the issue that caused me to give eWallet one star has been corrected, that said, I am now happy to give a five star. This software is a very valuable tool, and should be in everybody's smartphone.  Iliumsoft does not tell you that a data connection is required on your mobile device, or your eWallet will become unusable. It brings up concerns as to what else they may not be telling us about the need for a data connection! I have relied on eWallet for may years on my PC, and Windows phone, A few days ago when I really needed a important piece of information from eWallet, I could not get it, because it required that I connect to Amazon, and I had no data service. I contacted Ilium Software and they said &#34;It's ok, you just need to access you Amazon account&#34;. Excuse me, but I don't keep this info on my phone for nothing!! Then there is the ethical issue of not informing end users that a data connection is required, possible legal issue as well.
B003DZAMFW|5.0|I saw this movie five years ago while in flight overseas, and I thoroughly enjoyed it  and wanted to buy it, but it was not available in The States until recently. Since buying it, I watched it again, and I could not stop cracking up at its gut wrenching humor!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED IT!!!  All 3 were well written and attention grabbing.  All 3 books of the Trilogy, get 5 stars, easily.
0399229191|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from a friend, and around that same time my 18 month old daughter learned \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\" which is now her favorite song/rhyme. She has us sing it to her (complete with hand motions) about 10 times a day. Now she loves this book and [[ASIN:1879085690 The Itsy Bitsy Spider]] they are two of her favorite books. She brings them to me saying \\"Pie-durr bouht!\\" (Spider book) \\"peashj wedit!\\" (please read it). We love reading them before naps and bedtime since both stories end with the spiders going to sleep.<br /><br />This books is really well written and illustrated. I think a lot of children's \\"authors\\" and publishing houses are very lazy about content and illustrations, thinking a cartoon of a cow which says moo moo next to it is educational enough. This is a story about several things. #1. A spider who is so busy building her web that she has no time to talk to anyone. #2. Its a story about hard work paying off, and eventually getting a lovely rest at the end of a long day. #3. It teaches young children animal sounds, as well as animal behaviors. We learn that cats like to nap, goats like to climb, and that spiders build webs to catch flies in among other things.<br /><br />The repetition of simple phrases helps the child relax because its soothing, and when they get older and learn the story you can say, \\"But the spider didn't answer because...\\" and then the child can answer, \\"she was so busy building her web.\\" And also ask the child to tell you the different animals sounds and things like that.<br /><br />The illustrations are textured, you can feel the fly and web on each page. That's pretty cool as an added little thing that a child may enjoy. My daughter doesn't really care all that much but other kids might tracing the lines of the web, and looking for the fly on each page like a Where's Waldo.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch with the whole family.  Might be a bit scary for the younger viewers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really fun and adicting. it is awesome.its way better than the first temple run.there is a zipline and mines.this game is for every one.install the app and play and play and play and play and play.trust me you will love this app.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Since there are supposed to be two more volumes (at least), it will be a long wait for the next one.  This one definitely starts to bring the threads together.  But, as usual, the multiple cliffhangers at the end leave one wishing for more.
B008Y6YLBG|5.0|Great movie, thrilling exposé of a young woman fighting the odds against crazy inbreeding hillbillies..Jennifer Lawrence is hot and deserves all the credit for this movie..
B0058SNI94|4.0|awesome shoes. glad i made the purchase. I can wear these anywhere. Great for work and around the house. Im pregnant and still get the foot support i need
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a brilliant movie based on Brilliant story. It started out slowly for me, as did the book on tape and the book itself. However Aing Lee's direction made the story compelling and I can't get it out of my mind.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very relaxing and progressively challenging.<br />While not stressful, it builds up your confidence in your abilities to succeed at its greater challenges.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Crystal clear via HDMI, with exceptional quality, and great price used!  Why buy new?  A must for fans like us.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a quick read. A fascinating read about slaves and the lives they had led whether they worked in the field, or in the big house, how they nurtured the owners/wealthy and their children.<br />It also addresses the treatment of those light skinned servants whether they be offspring from the Master/slave or were Irish immigrants who got to America and whose parents died during the voyage, so they were sold to those who could afford them. The opportunities they were given could benefit them or they would have to suffer the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The premise of the book is fascinating. Even though the Owners have so much wealth in material things the slaves are wealthy in their love support and self character. They were the true caretakers of the estates. They were very loyal to their own and to the owners who loved them. They took a lot of abuse without saying a word, but would stand firm when enough was enough even though it may have meant their own life to save another.
B004HD61KE|3.0|Want this review deleted. Why doesn't amazon have a delete button? Good question. So they get something like this. Irritating.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Very well written. Outstanding history lesson. \\"Flight\\" did a great job on his description of characters and his vocabulary was very entertaining. If you love the space race era, then you will truly enjoy this book.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|A very good episode. This is one of he best shows on television.  Very good character development, and this story line was interesting
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|easy game and lots of fun to play....again this a simple game but good story and graphics...nice for kids as well as adults
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I first fell for ZAZ at a bar in Turkey that played her every night to draw in customers, and it worked. This little gal glides through delightful songs and can scat like crazy. If you like gypsy jazz, you'll like her band's delicate backing for her wonderful vocals. My high school French has failed me but I play it constantly, give it a spin at this bargain price.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|An inside look at a tortured soul- some of the things he does are off the charts crazy, others are heartbreakingly beautiful. All in all, a film that makes you consider life in a whole new light. Sad- don't expect an idealized happy hippy look at living in the wild on your own......
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Moral of the story- Don't have kids. They will suck away all your resources, make you miserable, and you will screw them up just like your parents did to you.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|It was entertaining for the 1+ hr, and I like Milla Jovovich, so not a waste of money in any way....for me.
B004FRB3OQ|5.0|The adapter is an affordable alternative to using expensive SXS cards.  It works.  Using them in a Sony ONE-Ex1 after a firmware upgrade.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Amazon recommended this book to me, but I did not realize that it was a book for teens. It is also a book that if I had a teenage girl, I would not want her to read it. Very sexual, and very cheesy... even though it dealt with serious issues such as child abuse. Would not recommend.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|As an aficionado of cartoon movies, Despicable Me landed in my sights and I remember eagerly going to see it in theatres. As soon as it was released on DVD I secured my copy from the local store, and a couple years later I can say that I still laugh just as hard today as I did when I first saw it at the 2:30 matinee when it was in theatres.<br /><br />Animation and Sound<br /><br />Despicable Me, an animated comedy presented in both 3D and 2D screenings, is the story of supervillain Gru and his desire to become world-famous for daring capers and heists. Voiced by Steve Carrell, he has a comically shaped body (bowling-ball bald head, carrot-shaped nose, huge torso and skinny legs), with a Russian accent reminiscent of Boris Badinov.<br /><br />The animation itself in the 3D screening is very good; the colors are bright and the small details (worn paint on doors, facial expressions are varied and comical) really do add a nice depth to the film. In terms of the 3D, the movie does deliver but not in any \\"WOW!!\\" way. On the upside, the 3D does not feel like a gimmick, either, and the usage of it is both comical and appropriate (the roller coaster ride was awesome and made my stomach do flip flops). In some instances the 3D was a bit blurry, but only during \\"movement\\" sequences. For the most part, the 3D was crisp (even though I had to wear the glasses over my own).<br /><br />The lip-synching of the characters was also very impressive, looking natural and well-made. The voices of the characters were great matches, with my only complaint being the voice of the children. With the exception of the youngest girl, the voices seemed a bit \\"old\\" for them. It may just be me, but what I am assuming is a 12 year old girl sounds more like an older teenager. Granted, I understand that the eldest, Margo, is supposed to be the \\"maternal\\" sibling who is watching out for the other two, but a younger voice would have matched the face a bit better.<br /><br />The music soundtrack for this movie is cute and matches the action. There is nothing especially memorable about it, however, so I do not think that I will be going out of my way to purchase the CD.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />Despicable Me is very funny, with a clever script and a lot of subtle puns. For instance, Gru applies for a loan through the Bank of Evil; a note on the entrance says \\"Formerly Lehman Brothers\\" - obviously a tongue-in-cheek reference and meant more for the adults in the theatre.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Gru plans to steal the moon. To do this, he needs a shrink ray. The movie centers around this concept, trying to explain how Gru will accomplish his goal while balancing his adoption of three oprhan sisters.<br /><br />It is important to remember that this is a kid's movie, so many of the jokes contained therein are geared for a younger crowd. By now, I am sure that many people have seen the Despicable Me commercial that involves the \\"fart gun\\"; while I generally think jokes about bodily functions are tasteless, the movie manages to result in many laugh-out-loud moments that revolve around relatively \\"juvenile\\" behavior.<br /><br />With all of this being said, the story is a bit predictable (at least, the overall plot), but what makes this movie great is how you get to the end. Gru's \\"evil\\" personality results in some great comedic moments. Although Gru tries to be a great villain, his antics usually come across as the petulant actions of a vindictive child. Freezing patrons in the coffeehouse to cut to the front of the line, parallel parking and bumping cars out of the way, driving a huge rocket-powered car that pollutes like mad; these are the extent of Gru's villainry. I found myself laughing quite often at all of this, though, if only because Gru's dedication to evil is so, well, dedicated.<br /><br />Finally, the three orphaned girls who are adopted by Gru and his yellow tic-tac shaped minions are true scene-stealers. The girls are adorable in their resolution, having had to fend for themselves in an orphanage with a self-serving and cruel headmistress. The minions are die-hardedly loyal to Gru, willing to sacrifice themselves for their villainous boss. The girls have a great sense of humor and are rascals, the minions speak in their own language and whack each other whenever possible. There are so many minion and little girl scenes with hysterical commentary and animation that you will definitely feel that the price of the movie admission is worth it.<br /><br />In short, while the plot isn't groundbreaking or even \\"new\\", the jokes and wonderful voice talents within the movie will keep you entertained. Even my husband, who normally is not thrilled with \\"kiddie\\" movies was chuckling very hard at some moments.<br /><br />The Final Verdict<br /><br />I highly recommend this title for anyone who wants a lighthearted comedy with a heartwarming tale. While you will undoubtedly be able to guess the ending of the movie very early on, sit back and enjoy the jokes and story as it develops. This movie will probably be booed by critics due to its predictability, but I can honestly say that I laughed harder at this movie than I have laughed at any movie for a long while. In fact, the laughs are very much in-line with some of the comic antics from other animated films (such as Shrek), with the script showing the talents of the voice actors and animators. Despicable Me is a fun romp through the warped mind of super villain Gru, resulting in a solid movie that is great for both kids and adults.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is perfect and have been using exclusively since I got it for my Apple 4S, it allows my custom designed skin to show through. It's relatively rugged and it slips into my pocket easily.<br />The only weird thing is the concentric ridges on the back, which I could do without. But for the price, its great.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|A bit predictable. But it was a page-turner. It would be a great beach or vacation read. I would recommend.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is a great album. I don't just mean a great Kiss album. I mean this is a great album! I can't think of the last time I listened to a CD over and over and over. Not since I was a kid, I guess. I can't get enough of these songs. Raw Power! KISS at its best
006224454X|4.0|When I browsed the first couple of pages of this book in the store, I got chills up and down my back. I have to say it was a bit creepy but very compelling. Having had my own transient global amnesia incident about 8 years ago made it even creepier to me as I could identify with the heroine's plight. She has memories only of the current day, even if she takes a nap, but she loses all memories of the last 20 years or so when she gets a full night's sleep. She starts to write a journal to create her own virtual memory and as things unfold the suspense ratchets up page by page until the climax.<br />I am deducting one star because two things didn't entirely mesh with reality for me. When I was hospitalized with transient global amnesia, I had lost 6 weeks of long term memory and my short term memory limit was just a few minutes.  After a few hours  I realized from the look on my wife's face that I was asking the same questions over and over and she confirmed it when I asked her (she later said I had sounded like Dustin Hoffman in Rainman). Once I realized I had amnesia I asked her for paper and a pen and started writing and re-reading my notes all day long in my hospital bed. There was a big clock on the wall and at the top of each page I wrote in big caps, \\"You have Amnesia - Take notes every ten minutes and write down the time and reread it all\\". I kept the notes on my lap and updated them every ten minutes until my short term memory started to return about 12 hours later. It's hard for me to understand why it took the heroine 20 years or so to realize a virtual memory could be created on paper. I also wonder why the heroine didn't just take cat naps at night as it seems she only lost her memory after a full night's sleep. I would have been sitting up all night with an alarm clock and not letting myself sleep more than a half hour at a time.<br />Regardless of these two failures of realism for me, this was a very compelling read. Like the Hitchcock film Rear Window,there's only a handful of characters and the turmoil is mostly psychological rather than physical. As things are revealed to the heroine in this novel, they are simultaneously revealed to the reader, making the reader as nervous as the heroine. There where many times when I was simultaneously eager and reluctant to turn the page.

B003MUOUI8|5.0|If you like rugby and/or inspirational sports films then you'll love this movie for sure.<br />Great acting, great story, great cinematography. What more could you want?
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story is solid, with unexpected twists and the characters are well developed.  The problem is the repetition of details during the trial and investigation.  There seems to be no other reason except to lengthen the book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Why did they end the series?  We have started watching the entire five years over again and will probably have to do that several more times until we have gotten our fill.
B00932A2MC|1.0|An alien ship lands in the middle of the ocean and the kind of damage it does while at sea is so ludicrous that it defies logic. The attempt to convert a board game into a movie is so contrived that no matter how hard I try to suspend my disbelief and accept the story for its worth - I can't get over how illogical and how stupid these aliens are. I mean after watching so many good alien invasion movies (War of the World) and some that aren't so good (Independence Day), even the not-so-good ones had a logical premise to it. This one does not. Furthermore watching Rihanna act is like watching an amateur on a high-school stage. Liam Neeson choose poorly in involving himself in this crud of a movie - and giving it 1 star is really being nice - it should be a -1 star.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|I took the kids to the theater to see this movie when it first came out.  We enjoyed it so much and I was so happy when it came out on dvd!  I would recommend this movie for everyone.

B006KX3GXO|4.0|Nice app.  I needed to adjust the contrast etc on a photo for Facebook.  This provided the functionality that I needed as well as has many other features for doctoring your photo.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This is going to be a short review.<br /><br />I have all of the KsE albums, I like BOTH Jessie and Howard vocals. Guitar solos? As a metal fan, KsE has never really been about solos, but this album has quite a few solos in the mix; very surprising and rock solid! Jessie is an outstanding metal vocalist - one of the best. Everyone is delivering as they should!<br /><br />Couldn't be more happier, it's not my favorite KsE album but it's in my top 3. I miss Howard's 'melodic' vocals mixed with his screams, but it's not like Jessie can't do it either!<br /><br />Enjoy the album, it gets a drive to work done in no time!<br /><br />5/5
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't do Twitter and I hate Facebook but just like cell phones, I don't know how I lived without it.
078689136X|5.0|Talk about breaking the 4th wall! I like the premise of the story and having to read the events and tying it to some of the episodes that they were lifted off from makes reading this book really fun! But I have to admit - this book does not come close to any of James Patterson's books i.e. Alex Cross series in terms of suspense and &#34;grip the edges of the book until it tears off&#34; terror. So if you read this and judge it by its own merits - I have to admit it's so-so. But in the context of the TV series - it gives you a glimpse of how Castle really fantasizes about Beckett - and how he uses this as his outlet to express his then unrequited desires (talk about literary masturbation - referencing season 4 episode &#34;Nikki Heat&#34;)! So my recommendation - read it if you are a big Caskett shipper. Pass if you're thinking it reads like a Clive Cussler or James Patterson book.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great acting and a very powerful issue in today's society.  I loved the ending, shows there is hope and redemption for all of us.
0385535147|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham's books, I have enjoyed each one of them and always look forward to his new ones.  This book was a very good read!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|another great way to read books on the go.books that fit into your pocket or purse.easier than carrying a pad or laptop!
B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|Everyone else seems to like this. The graphics are phenomenal, I will say that.<br /><br />But I just keep getting killed, I have earned points and upgraded my heroes and weapons and stuff. I'm no stranger to games like this, but...<br /><br />The default setting keeps trying to send me to a multiplayer environment. As soon as I click Play, it says an *internet connection is not detected* or some nonsense. It doesn't even try, it just goes right to that message. I obviously have an internet connection or you would not be reading this. This seems to be important because I have collected a lot of souls, and it seems you can only use them to steal from friend's games. Gee, that's how much I think of my friends.<br /><br />I dunno, I can't use this feature. It seems that, without being able to play online and steal from my \\"friends\\" I can not make any headway. I deleted this after a lot of time wasted.<br /><br />Davemonster<br />dbn2019@msn.com
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed the first three episodes of season 3 and since it is currently playing on my local station I will not be able to see any reruns anytime soon which is why I love the instant video.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Very entertaining. The story line and the acting are very good. I can' wait to see the nest season. I am recommending it to all ofmy friends and family.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is meant to be enjoyed slowly, like a good drink.  Victor Hugo was a highly cultivated man, sensitive and observant.  In one of the best novels of all times, he tells us stories of hate and redemption, of love and sacrifice, of the greatness and heroism that can be found even in people of the humblest origins.  With a spectacular dominion of language, he portrays a vivid picture of France in the 1800's and explains the ideals of the French Revolution.  The lense focused on the poor and ignorant, makes us wonder if we are partly to blame of their situation... Perhaps, what I liked the most, is that there is always a feeling of Hope.
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|Been a DM fan since Music for the Masses.  I enjoyed listening to their earlier stuff, but hey it was the 80's.  Listening to the pre-Violator music today is difficult except for the obvious catchy pop hits that stand out.  As probably most DM fans, you were in heaven during the Violator/SOFD album era.  The sound was amazing with the deeper bass and the useage of more guitars to give it a perfect techno/rock mix and Martin's ballads were on a completely different level.  Even the B-side stuff was great, &#34;Sea of Sin, Happiest Girl&#34;.  Since then they have struggled as artists to push themselves into new territory but still make music that is appealing to the masses.  Had Violator/SOFD albums never happened, I am sure everyone would be happy with what has been released over the past 18 years.  As a fan, I feel I struggle as other fans do with trying hard not to compare every new album to Violator/SOFD. It's also hard not to be mad at them for not sticking with a recipe that obviously was amazing.  You just want to grab them and make them listen to those albums again and say, &#34;Why can't you make it sound more like this?&#34;  I sometimes wish that those 2 albums never got made so that I could not be so judgemental when I hear every new album since.  Don't get me wrong, there have been some really great songs released since then but not a complete album of songs.  I really got excited when they released Playing the Angel album.  I felt that was a complete album that had a great sound and that they were getting back to what the fans needed, but then &#34;Sounds of the Universe&#34; was released, I was horrified.  What direction was this?  I tried my best to fall in love with it.  I listened to it over and over for weeks, just like you are supposed to do with DM albums and though most times I grew to love a change in their sound.  I couldn't find it in &#34;Sounds of the Universe&#34;. I won't even go into a discussion of the whole Alan Wilder producing thing.Then I got excited when they started promoting the new album and Dave Gahan kept referring to it as being more of a Violator/SOFD sound.  Then the single, &#34;Heaven&#34; was released....Ummm...<br /><br />What can I say about this new album?  If you are a true DM fan, you need to buy it and make sure you listen to it a couple of dozen times before you pass judgement.  Is it up there in the Violator/SOFD love?  Nope, but as I have gotten a lot older I have come to realize that nothing will ever be as good as though albums, it was lightning in a bottle.  They still have the artistic ability to write compelling lyrics and the messages within the songs, but it's how they are arranged and the sounds they use.  My first complaint is that there is a bunch of little computer/digital sounds that come across as overused throughout the album.  The beginning of the songs don't grab your attention, they need to come on with harder percussion and make you want to dance or sing along with what's about to start.  Is this album near the bottom of all their albums if you were forced to rank them?  Of course not.  You might find 2-3 songs that you actually enjoy listening to and memorize the words to sing along with.  You might have to wait for some of the remixes to come out to find something you would want to dance to or hear at a club.  But give this album a real chance and appreciate that they are still making music and not just retiring like 99% of all the other bands you once loved.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I loved watching this epic saga from weeek to week and finding out what unfolds next. Now I can watch it anytime!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|ONCE U DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT ASKS TO DOWLOAD OK RIGHT?NOOOOO IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO LOAD IT TAKES ABOUT 1HOUR DON'T GET THIS APP EVER
B00992CF6W|5.0|I highly recommend this game to you! YOU do creative and survival mode connect on<br />Multiplayer but you have to be under the same WiFi just fyi I definitely think it's worth the 6.99$ I will list some other games I recommend Survival Craft, and full version of that.Temple Run ,Brave, Angry Gram Run etc. Have Fun!!!
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I was very happy to receive this addition to my collection.............look forward to many more years of collecting Kelly's work.
1451695195|1.0|Proof of heaven: zero, zilch, nada.  The same goes for every god that has ever been imagined.  But actually in the case of the gods it's worse than having no proof, for they can almost always be disproven by their irreconcilably contradictory \\"holy books\\", science and history.  For example the Bible disproves the Bible god, as does virtually every branch of science.<br /><br />Don't be such a credulous fool!  The gods--including yours--were invented by dishonest men for political control and to extort money from unquestioning sheep.  Sheep are raised to be fleeced and slaughtered by the shepherd for the shepherd's personal gain.  The Christian analogy of sheepish followers and their (clearly for-profit) shepherds is actually pretty accurate.  Your shepherd (Rev., Pastor, favorite T.V. sheister, etc.)is only interested in your money and your free labor to build his/her bank account and religio-political empire.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Had much more than I was expecting, plus love being able to visit and look in on all my old haunts.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This cd is awesome.  If your a fan of the violin or dance music it is  than moreworth the price
B000000OU0|5.0|What can one say!!!! It's the Eagles and I love them after all these years.  Waiting impatiently for more.  Great!
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I enjoyed the CD very much, not every ones style of music i am sure but if you enjoy electronic music and a good beat this is for you.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wish this was a continuous show.  Hope it isn't ever cancelled.  I am fascinated by the society rules and culture of this time period in England.  And the fact that some heirs did not sustain their legacy.  This is a good lesson in sustainability for all of us.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|These bulbs are close to standard light bulbs in terms of shape and lighting performance, but consume far less than CFL and Incandescent bulbs.  I will buy more!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Again, I had heard a few of these songs and was very hopeful the whole CD would be that great!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book. I love the precept August wrote on the postcard \\"Everybody deserves a standing ovation at least once in their life because we all overcometh the world.\\" R.J. Placido you deserve a standing ovation!<br /><br />P.S. this book is life-changing and I'm a just a kid
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|It was very slow moving; and the dialog was just Day Lewis talking to hear himself talk.<br />I  know I am in the minority. I have seen better presentations of Lincoln's life and times.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I saw this movie in the mid 1980s and enjoyed it then. It depicts life in the mid 21st century - not too far.  Lots of action, good character development with an almost believable story line of human &#34;replicants&#34; run amuck with Harrison Ford as a Blade Runner whose job is to track the replicants down and eliminate them..
B004TI5N38|4.0|Keeps you thinking, easy to follow but full of twists. This is a Baldacci favorite, I couldn't put it down.
B004VPAXIY|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD of Kate Bush.  Some of my favorite songs are:; The Dreaming, Get Out Of My House and Houdini.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a Kate Bush fan.
B0000074EF|4.0|This cd is made up of \\"ten years after\\" early rare songs. most of them are on the bonus track versions of the bands first three discs. At that point they were a blues rocking band. and hadn't gone hard rock yet. Their first three cd's are filled with songs like this. Fans of the later stuff may have a hard time with this at first. Music was different in 1968 as compared to even two years later. This one is for completists of the band and for those who love blues rock. (and the late Alvin lee's genius) Alvin lee (rip).
0743270754|4.0|This was very educational and entertaining. I did not realize the width breadth of Lincolns political abilities.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Enjoy.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The book started off strong but it fell short in the details for me. The author seemed to glaze over important details of the story. Without giving up any spoilers, I didn't understand how no one heard the baby screaming and yet at other times everyone seemed to be in the right place at the right time, and how everyone continually forgave and forgot her behavior, etc. It all seemed a bit juvenile to me. The ending felt rushed and rather like wishful thinking. I would not recommend to friends.
B00000DQSS|5.0|This is another great CD of Kate Bush.  My favorites on the CD are:  Breathing, Babooskha, The Wedding List, and Song of Delius.  I like the art work of the CD,  Violin is another great track on the Cd.  I will say that it is a must have for your Kate Bush music collection.
B003RT0NK8|5.0|Well I'd never heard of this movie when I decided to try it out on Amazon Prime.  It was a delight.  The entire movie I was on the edge of my seat and when it was all over, I couldn't have been happier with the movie.  I'll be checking it out again, and perhaps trying to buy it on blu-ray.  Defiantly watch it with someone who loves suspense films.
0671027344|5.0|Seriously, read it, it's amazing, and judging by how popular it is, if you hate it you can sell it for twice this.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|GREAT graphics. Fun gameplay, couple loading issues after trying to come back to it on the kindle fire. Hope it works again after this review.
B000007MVL|5.0|Another fabulous CD of Kate Bush.  My favorites are:  Symphony In Blue, Hammer Horror and Wow.  I like the cover with the lion.
B000NA77YO|5.0|There is nothing to discredit the cd. After all, Black Sabbath is a true legend of the good times rock and roll. Current as always.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This is one of the most amazing kits that LEGO has put out in the past few years.  When you're done, you have a very realistic large-scale model of Volkswagen's iconic T1 Camper van.  It's also obvious that LEGO put a lot of love into this kit, as there's lots of little touches, like the lava lamp chilling on the shelf.  It's a fun build that will take you a while and something you don't have to be ashamed of displaying on your shelf -- or playing with, if that's your style.<br /><br />However, where I think this kit will really shine is in resale value.  Not only is it a good looking kit, it's a very popular Volkswagen product.  LEGO will likely discontinue this model in the next year or two, and when they do, you can expect the price to double in a very short period of time.  One only needs to look at the LEGO VW Beetle to see what I mean, and that kit doesn't look half as good as this one.  I highly recommend buying one to build and another one to keep in the box for sale in 24 months or so.  You won't regret it.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Incredible! A very good retrospective on the life of Bob Marley. A must for anyone wanting to know the real Bob!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I have long been a student of history.  I have stood at the feet of the Lincoln memorial and felt with intense emotion the impact of what one person can do if they so choose.  I hope that everyone will watch this with an open and attentive mind, for there is much to learn about our country and ourselves.<br /><br />The actors chosen were entirely perfect, as was the portrayal of the times.  I am utterly amazed at the ability of Mr. Lewis to shape shift and cause me to utterly forget that I was watching my favorite actor.  I am thrilled for him that he was able to experience this role, and thrilled for posterity that we can now have such an improved understanding of that enigmatic leader-a man with a vision and an iron will to change the course of history.<br /><br />AMAZING WORK. Thank you.
B008UTV6S8|1.0|I honestly expected to find the magic of the old days of the partnership with Art<br />Ledo mistake.<br />It's not all bad because Simon Contina being a reference.<br />But personally I would not buy again ESSA offer.
1558908846|5.0|I like this one better than the remake. Lots more humor. Classic Stallone. I'm glade I bought it. If you haven't seen this movie you should.
B008CYDD7I|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years and years. Get old horror. In the vein of Evil Dead or Day of the Dead. I love it...
0446554995|5.0|Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are two of my favorite writers, whether they work together or individually. Special Agent Pendergast is one of my all time favorite characters in any type of fiction or movie. Needless to say, I am always excited to read the next Pendergast novel, and Two Graves was no exception.<br /><br />If you are keeping up with the series, Agent Pendergast has spent the last two books investigating the faked murder of his wife, Helen, which led him to uncover a secret Nazi underground organization. He finally was reunited with her in the last book, Cold Vengeance, but this book starts with her abduction by the Nazi group, beginning a long, dark descent for Pendergast that leads him to a secret Nazi stronghold built on a volcano in Brazil, and includes genetic experimentation involving Pendergast and his Helen.<br /><br />There's a lot to the story, so I encourage you to read Fever Dream and Cold vengeance first, themselves excellent books, if you want the full experience.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was fast paced, riveting, suspenseful and exotic. The villains are easy to hate and root against, and the heroes make you pull for them with all you heart. The Pendergast story has progressed well over the years, but I am personally ready for a stand alone adventure, all though Two Graves leaves an open thread that will obviously be explored in the future.<br /><br />I didn't like two sub-plots that seemed out of place in this novel, but with the ongoing series aspect, perhaps they will become relevant in the future.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this one, especially if you are a fan of the series. If not, what are you waiting for? These books are fun! Worth the price of the hardcover.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|While this does pay homage to Heinlein's Starship Troopers, it carries it's own weight and is not a rip off. There is some adult scenes but fit the nature of the book and fortunately not too graphic (but close). Unique take on recruitment that seems almost plausible.
B009AMANBA|3.0|After all the publicity (and awards shows) I was disappointed in the actual product.  I prepared for watching the movie by carefully reading the book and I am well educated in the history.  However I often found myself bored  and wondering who was who and what was going on.  It was punctuated by some compelling moments, but I know that was Spielberg working on the emotions.  On the positive side Daniel Day Lewis eerily inhabited the role so completely it was as if Lincoln again walked the earth.  Likewise the attention to detail in furniture and costume was magnificent.  I just didn't find that it worked as a coherent narrative unlike other sprawling epics by the same director such as Schindler's list.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've learned a lot about love and relationships. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I plan on reading it again soon.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Great cliff hanger! You know there has to be another one.  I seem to remember more to it than what they showed.  But it was excellent!
B0051E9JNE|4.0|this is the first and still the best of th e highlander's can watch over and over and still good
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Happy that the CD arrived so quickly and in perfect condition.  There are songs on it i never heard before and am enjoying.
B004IPPINW|5.0|What I like best is the author's successful effort in revealing the underlying humanity of both cultures, which is all too often forgotten in the great scheme of things.
1582406723|5.0|I love The Walking Dead. I've only watched the TV series and I have heard the comics are really good. So I decided to start reading them. I wasn't disappointed. This is a great comic. I love the graphics and story line. I will be buying the others to start my collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is a great game i play it almost evey day and it is nice to be able to play on the kindle
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I certainly felt convicted, having not taught my Love for Jesus Christ to my children in their 'growing up years', but this movie made me feel that we as parents have an obligation and deep seeded duty to teach our children about the love that God has freely given us in his son Jesus and how we should love one another, even through the 'dark' times.  I highly recommend this to couples to watch with open hearts!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|We loved it, mostly the spectular dance scenes<br /><br />The quality of the presentation was much better than expected for such an old picture
0345803507|5.0|I loved reading all three books, it was a very romantic ,easy to read and understand trilogy....erotic , yes ,of course it was redundant at times...but who cares it was a no brainer...and entertaining!oh very much, couldn't put it down...i think it was very much what a woman wants to read  about ...a fantasy: a man who you can help and who will actually listen!!!, a romantic man with his faults and demons but very loving, a good lover , good looking , always trying to fulfill her wishes and of course very wealthy !<br />I will miss the story.....
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the writing, the story, and the characters.  I also enjoy the fact that you never really know whats going to happen next...George RR Martin has no probelm killing off a major character.  A pleasure to read
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a very good game maybe make it a little more interesting. and make it a little more fun. but it does have a great sense in how to take care of a horse
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This is the first book I have read about life in North Korea.  What an eye opener, how sad that we can't stop this assault on humanity!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I am assuming there will be one or more movies to bring us back to the original movie Lord of the Rings.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|If you are a Hello Kitty such as myself, you will absolutely love this app.  It is really cute and adorable.  I'm considering buying the real version so that I can go to other levels.  I really enjoy it!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This app work great for me, but sometimes it makes my kindle lag a bit. And the levels are too hard to get through.<br />It is a good app to pass the time, though.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was an interesting story and it really kept you hooked throughout the book but it just ended.  In the end both characters are sycho.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app provides the background sound that feels like quiet. I love it. It has many more sounds than I need, but that made it easy to find the one that works for me.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|If you love tennis, then this app is definitely for you.  It is very user friendly, it does get progressingly hard, but who doesn't love a great challenge!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app it's works great and worth every penny I'm so glad I got it thanks so much.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Great movie, especially since it was based on a true story. Didn't quite have the impact of movies like Schindlers List, but it is a much happier movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|suspenseful, keeps you watching. very good storyline and it is easily an addiction. i will be watching this series more than once.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This is a little quirky, but slightly addictive.  It will definitely work the brain muscles.  I loved the varying levels.  The graphics aren't half bad either!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keeps drawing u back in, I think I finished it in 2 days. Great book with a good story and interesting twist. I great summer read!!
0071771263|5.0|Th book is of great help when preparing for the toefl. Im from Brazil and i thought it would never come, but it did, and before the deadline! Im really happy with my order.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read or heard of several others on this topic, but here is someone who has the background, the intelligence and the experience to let the reader know that this is real. He gives such hope to those of us who truly believe.  Just beautiful! I have recommended this to many friends.
1480111724|5.0|TALES FROM THE COURTROOM<br /><br />The somewhat prosaic title of the book belies a varied and fascinating exploration of the follies and idiosyncrasies of the legal world and those who have crossed its path. Brian Harris reveals a breadth of learning and the rare skill of imparting through well researched examples some of the hard lessons that history has to offer, all too often overlooked or misunderstood by contemporary lawyers and laymen alike. Tales of witches, corrupt chief justices, slavery, subway vigilantes, \\"Old Sparky\\" and the real Reginald Perrin vie with Thomas Jefferson and the account of the jurymen and the Ouija Board, anarchists and seducers through well defined themes. Brian Harris' valedictory chapter leaves the reader in no doubt as to the author's moral and legal compass. He examines the address given by Billings Learned Hand, Chief Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to 150,000 newly naturalised citizens assembled in Central Park to swear the oath of allegiance to their newly adopted country 2 weeks before the Normandy landings and the sacrifice made by North Americans to save Europe from the tyranny of dictatorship.<br />Erudition and humour lie side by side, and with an engaging style make this book a must for those who wish to be entertained as well as informed. For anyone needing material for a speech this is a real lifesaver.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Best Bond. Most believable of them all, and the best plot twists and turns. Makes me want to see the original
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this adventure game and it was an interesting storyline.  It had the right balance of different challenges for those who like more variety.  I look forward to any sequels!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Way overrated propaganda.  The two stars are for the time invested in making the film look authentic. Besides that, there was not much to be enjoyed here.
B0007W0MTA|1.0|This is supposed to be 2 CDs, with 49 tracks.  Well, I received 2 CDs, but only 22 tracks.  Despite being labelled Disc 1 & Disc 2, they both contained ONLY the tracks that are on Disc 2.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Disc 2 is awesome, but I am peeved I don't have Disk 1.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|It just didn,t seem real!  Too much to be real and very sad with all animals being killed violently! Not believable
B000000OSE|5.0|excelente atencion y muy buena calidad, de producto muy buen servicio y puntualidad de entrega, buenos precios y buena explicacion del producto al momento de ver las publicaciones
B000002AS3|2.0|....I bought this CD back in the mid 90's and recently pulled it out for a listen after over a decade of sitting on the shelf. What did I discern? Well, Liam can't sing very well. In fact, it's pretty awful! His brother Noel has a more pleasant voice. Though the songs aren't that bad for a retro-rock band, I can't get over how bad the vocals are. I just can't listen to Liam's slurring, nasally voice! I understand I am in the minority here on this, but with near a thousand CD collection, this one isn't worth sitting on my shelf anymore. Off the the used CD store.....
B00BWJARHO|5.0|love it just as much as i love the lord of the rings (but there aren't as many good looking real size men in this one)....story line good, graphics/effects great....thrill. thanks!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was a page turner! I found it well written and exciting. The characters seem real and are interesting. It was hard to put down the further I got into it! I will definitely read other books by this author.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the story line, but it was a bit wordy with the love scenes.  I am a senior and I don't read much about high school romances.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Haven't played enough to rate it at this time.  So far I am enjoying it.  I didn't know there would be as many ads.  Thank you
B0027MJU00|4.0|Just like Gone Girl, this novel is full of suspense and worth every minute. The characters are interesting and conflicted, and we wonder if we truly like the protagonist - she's got some darkness and some habits that don't exactly inspire empathy. The ending was a little to quickly wrapped for me, once it was time to explain just what did happen, but I still loved it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy and God's also action and adventure...also hero's and romance all combined<br /><br />By zoe

B004LWZW7Y|3.0|Given the success of the Puss character from the second Shrek film onward, one would get the feeling it would take a lot to screw up the origin story.  However, looking at the film as a whole, it certainly falls short of the expectations of the franchise on which it's based.  This isn't to suggest it's a total failure of course, so much as it seems the producers of this piece were oddly out of touch with what made the character (and the Shrek series in general) so endearing.<br /><br />Coming in at runtime of 90-minutes and wearing an appropriate PG rating, 2011's Puss In Boots set DreamWorks back $130-million.  Believe it or not, the film was originally intended to be a direct-to-dvd affair before DreamWorks decided the character may have enough clout to potentially fill theaters.<br /><br />The tale naturally revolves around Puss, and sets up the vain, confident, swashbuckler (voiced by Antonio Banderas) as a kitten with delusions of grandeur, made more achievable by an unlikely partnership with one Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis).  Before long the pair is on a quest to find the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs, in hot pursuit by a murderous, drunkard Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), and teaming up with the feisty and seductive Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in Spain and the surrounding deserts and while its visuals are undeniably DreamWorks, the film certainly lacks the vivid color pallet of the Shreks and instead relies upon a lot of moonlit and fire-lit scenes.  Despite moody tones and a fairly convoluted plot-line, the characters themselves are animated wonderfully with the titular character hilariously alternating between pint-sized swashbuckler and run-of-the-mill feline with regularity.<br /><br />The film is laced with a lot of salsa-flavored tunes and beats and there are a number of requisite dance sequences to accompany the rhythmic tunes.  The pacing, however, isn't quite as butter-smooth as one would expect from a big budget Hollywood animated film.  Some of said dance numbers run on a bit too long and flashbacks to Puss' roots disrupt the natural flow of the present (which, if you want to be technical is still the past in the mythos).<br /><br />In all Puss In Boots is a fun film from the director of Shrek The Third though a strong argument could be made that this isn't DreamWorks' biggest or best animated feature.  I'm of the opinion that the fairy tale integration isn't near as subliminal or well-placed as we've witnessed in the Shrek films and the uneven pacing makes it easy for very young viewers to become bored with the story.  However, the nuances of the characters themselves mixed with some moments of clever dialog do make it interesting enough for adults to sit through.  In all, it's a very good formula for a rental.tter-smooth as one would expect from a big budget Hollywood animated film.
