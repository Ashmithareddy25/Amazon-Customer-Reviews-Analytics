B000UD08HW|5.0|I feel a bit uncertain as to exactly what I was to receive. Perhaps, I am a spoiled when Blue Ray is mentioned in a music/movie title. Blue Ray most often includes DTS Audio. DTS exceeds Dolby digital 5.1 by more than a discernible amount. Without it, I do not consider a DVD blue ray- complete. It is what it is. High definition video is another matter that should compliment the audio portion.<br />Regardless, the importance of an example of outstanding quality in the total musical DVD Blue Ray experience I would say Peter Gabriel's New Blood Live Is 100% of the industries consumer quality standard.<br />Even, His Growing Up live, although not a blue ray. The audio quality is better than any of Gilmour's releases unless it has DTS.<br />Scott

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has been known for his amazing love stories, like \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Dear John\\". His novel \\"The Lucky One\\" is no different from the others. It is a great love story like \\"The Notebook\\", but also shows the military aspect of how many service members deal with their experiences and life after war like \\"Dear John\\". This novel shows how friends can influence decisions that we ourselves would not have made otherwise and how love can be found in the most unusual places.<br /> Initially, the story seems a little farfetched because how can someone seek a complete stranger out simply because he is lead to believe that the stranger's picture is his lucky charm. I think that any military member will tell you that a simple picture can make a difference when they are placed in a war zone and that is the only thing that they have that is close to their heart. In the novel \\"The Lucky One\\", a prior Marine named Thibault seeks out a woman whom he has never met simply because he finds her picture in Kuwait and then somehow survives several missions in Iraq. This alone does not influence Thibault's decision to seek Elizabeth out, but when his close friend is killed in a boating accident in front of him, it changes everything. I think that one situation changed Thibault even more than all the experiences from war and several deployments. Thibault follows his friend Victor's advice to seek the woman out to pay her back for simply \\"saving his life\\" through the many deployments and missions. The description of how Thibault walked from Colorado to North Carolina to find Elizabeth is amazing about how he walked through many obstacles with his dog Zeus simply to find her. This devotion and dedication alone would make anyone to know about how this man that is lost and in need of something he cannot put his finger on, find his way. This novel is not only about the love story that develops between Thibault and Elizabeth, but about how each of us as individuals require certain things to rediscover ourselves and who we are. Thibault figures out how to deal more with the loss of his friend and Elizabeth finally discovers what she needs to become herself again after many years. Sparks shows that after the discovery of why Thibault is actually in Hampton, Elizabeth is reminded of her brother and his strange attachment to that very picture. Thibault feels he needs to keep Elizabeth and her son safe from her ex-husband since he \\"owes\\" her his life. The ending is very surprising how the picture eventually keeps Elizabeth's son safe, but allows for the \\"bad guy\\" to be removed from the story for a happily ever after ending. I think the way Sparks describes this situation and the events that follow, makes the reader feel like it could actually happen. The way Sparks describes how love can come out of a strange situation and overcome many things, makes any reader feel that love does conquer all.<br /> The main idea about a man seeking a woman in a picture he found and is lead to believe is his lucky charm seems a little strange, but Sparks does a wonderful job making me feel it could actually happen. I think that anyone that is put in a very stressful situation such as war can be lead to believe that a simple picture could be a lucky charm and keep them safe. Thibault's walk from Colorado to North Carolina is strange, but given the situation can be found normal as a form of therapy to help him cope with the loss of his friend. Sparks does a great job showing how love can easily develop when two lonely people finally find that person to share silence with and is easy to talk to. He also shows how many service members today deal with many things post war that most of us that make up the population can never fully understand. I think this book is a great addition to the Nicholas Sparks collection and should be read by those that love his books and new readers that love a good love story.

B003FB0268|5.0|Here a man overcomes one of the worst atrocities that a human being can inflict upon another and I'm not talking about one human being but a collective of human beings against another collective. The Holocaust displayed such horrors but this book shows and identifies a conflict one would think the Holocaust, but that's not the conflict Victor examines man himself within his conflict himself and his environment finding meaning in his actions in how he approaches life, \\"What he becomes -within the limits of endowment and environment-he has made out of himself.\\"<br />\\"Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.\\" Victor express his own testimony of the Holocaust he was a survivor for three years in the camp he shares his observations as he observes those encamped around and about \\"In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behave like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.\\" Victor retorts his findings how the human being can overcome adverse situations even though the environment was created to destroy the human spirit Victor expresses that it is not the conditions that make the decision it is the decision of the one that makes his choice of the outcome. Many of us have endured tragedy that's what makes this book identifiable although our tragedies are unique they create the same questions, \\"How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?\\" When most people especially soldiers in the military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars question their views on life from the traumatic events they have witness and endured, not only within the theater but within the home and so we find ourselves lost within our trauma questioning life, \\"Can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects? After all, \\"Saying yes to life in spite of everything.\\" In a world that is quick to write someone off or medicate Victor expresses that we have to be careful as the collective body, \\"First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \\"nothingness,\\" the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of a man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is a pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\"<br />Victor created \\"Logo therapy\\", a therapist a Logo therapist's role, \\"consist of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.\\" He believes that you have to go beyond yourself the future and not dwell in the past, \\"he stimulated many therapists to look beyond patients past or present problems to help to choose productive futures by making personal choices and taking responsibility for them.\\" I truly see this book as inspirational one that can help one to get back on track to push it forward, \\"to take a stand towards the conditions.\\" Victor says, \\"What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaningless of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningless in rational terms, Logos is deeper than logic.
B007PKOKTK|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  This is one of those movies that is so sloppily done that it leaves nothing except randomly animated slapstick humor.  Your kids may enjoy it well enough, but this isn't a movie that mom and dad and the kids will all get something out of.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|My best friend kept BEGGING me to read this book and I kept thinking this was not for me but she just WOULD NOT let it go. So finally I gave in and I am so glad I did!!! I should know that my best friend knows me best. Sophia is such a great, complex character who is brave and strong with everything she went through. There's even a drop dead gorgeous love interest and who doesn't LOVE a cute guy. Even if you don't think you're into \\"this sort of book\\" you HAVE to give it a try!!<br /><br />I thought the same thing about [[ASIN:B000QRIGLW Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] but yet again my overbearing best friend said I HAD to read it and fell in love!!!!

B0059XTUVI|2.0|Where to start?  Maybe find the director and or writer and slap them and ask them what they were thinking!  They had a great story to tell with one of the all time best actresses and they \\"over-thought\\" it.  Her life was amazing enough without trying to be so complex about it.<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges with doing a bio-pic like this is if you cover a life from beginning to end, 180 minutes is not enough.  They should have just focused in on a couple of significant events in her life that helped explain her and did the story.  But rather you are told the story from an 80 year old woman who is suffering from mental illness.  I have heard she is suffering from Alzheimer's but in the movie they make it look like the disease from A Beautiful Mind.<br /><br />Not only is from her perspective, but then we get flashbacks.  Start at the end of her career, then flashback to the beginning.. Back to the end.. Then back to the 1970s'.  Then from the 70's back to the beginning, then back to the end.  Yep - flashbacks within flashbacks.<br /><br />Here is how disappointing this film is.  It is called The Iron Lady because the Russians gave her that name because of her tough negotiating. Yet, the film NEVER shows her negotiating with the Russians.<br /><br />If you watch it for the acting you will not be disappointed but you will walk away shaking your head at what the film makers could have done and instead it was wasted.

B003LL3NOK|4.0|It's truly a sign that when George Romero can no longer make a terrific zombie film anymore that this whole zombie craze B.S. that's swept the world in the last 8 years or so, is....well, dead.  A friend of mine summed it up by saying that there should be a law passed by congress that no zombie films can be produced, in Hollywood(especially) or independently, for at least a decade.  With zombies in T.V commercials, every video game including a \\"zombie mode\\", eight billion zombie novels appearing on the shelves(including those atrocious cutesy zombie survival guides), a television show(which really is much better than I thought it would be oddly enough), and even making appearances on Spongebob Squarepants, how can it not all fall into parody?  Every zombie film that comes out anymore seems to be a comedy!  How do you bring the creepiness or seriousness back to the genre?  Zombie movies have always been a kind of taboo, gruesome movies that only weird horror people watched.  I have no problem with the zombie film getting more exposure and becoming more acceptable, but it seems that whenever that happens to a genre or idea, it soon becomes overkill and almost immediately turns to crap, especially when Hollywood goes in for a piece of the action.<br />Sorry, I didn't intend to rant about all this for so long, but I can't help it when zombie movies are the hot topic.<br />So, what's with this Romero movie everybody's bitching about?  Well, I gotta say that Survival of the Dead isn't quite as bad as it's reputation would have you believe.  The problem is that it's Romero.  We count on Romero to give us the great zombie film that will stomp all the wannabees to dust, to show us all how it's REALLY done.  Problem is, is that he's buried in a sea of his own imitators, most of them bad.  And Land of the Dead, Diary and Survival come across to horror fans like Lucas' last Three Star Wars movies come across to Sci-Fi fans.  What could Romero possibly do to follow up three classic films, especially after such a hiatus that allowed their legacy to grow.<br />The sad fact is that Survival comes across like a straight-to-video or made-for-SyFy movie.  An above average one, in my opinion, but a run of the mill one nonetheless, and that's not what we expect from Romero.<br />The story follows a rogue group of soldiers looking for their own private piece of the world, and think they've found it in a New England coastal island, but a Hatfield/McCoy-ish civil war is going on there.  One family, led by Kenneth Welsh(who I loved in Twin Peaks, and is a dead ringer for Terence Stamp) wants to wipe all zombies out and make the island a safehaven, while the opposing family are religious nuts who want to keep the dead \\"alive\\" and chained.  Why?  To try to get them to acquire an appetite for another meat besides human.  The zombies don't seem to comply when horses and other animals are served to them, so the zombies spend much of their time doing manual labor and chores around the farm.  It's an extension on ideas put forth in Day of the Dead.<br />Once the soldiers and Welsh(who had been exiled) come to the island, a war is waged.  Like I said before, I really don't think this movie was all that bad.  No, the cast isn't full of DeNiros, Romero has started using CG since Land(which is probably my biggest complaint as it makes it look all the more SyFy channel-ish, and is just a flat out sin amongst horror fans, right on par with the running zombies), the social message isn't as strong, gore is minimal, and a twist involving an identical twin sister will make you roll your eyes.<br />Even with all of that, I'll take this movie over 100 Zombielands and 1,000,000 Resident Evils.  I don't think Romero has \\"lost it\\", I just think he's stuck in a Catch 22 type situation with the way the film industry is now and a genre that has been all but ruined.sic films, especially after such a hiatus that allowed their legacy to grow.<br />The sad fact is that Survival comes across like a straight-to-video or made-for-SyFy movie.

1401201911|5.0|What if Superman had landed in Soviet Russia instead of Smallville, Kansas? DC's \\"Elseworlds\\" series imagines an alternate take on the Superman story with \\"Comrade Superman\\" becoming ruler of Soviet Russia, slowly taking over the world while an independent America led by Lex Luthor fights against an increasingly unhinged and totalitarian-minded Man of Steel.<br /><br />Mark Millar has written no less than a masterpiece with \\"Superman: Red Son\\". We see the character of Superman evolve from an idealistic young man to new ruler to an increasingly isolated and intolerable megalomaniac who takes his god-like powers and status and tries to make the world into a utopia. Red Superman is at turns heroic and then more dark until he's a terrifying figure of absolute power taken to the limit.<br /><br />Lex is the real star of the book and Millar does a fine job of making him at turns arrogant and ruthless but also charming and funny and with his tireless and imaginative efforts at bringing down the Superman, nothing less than a superhero in his own right. I like when writers add nuance to Luthor's character instead of single-minded cartoonist villainy and Millar hits the right chord with his characterisation of Luthor here.<br /><br />There are great moments throughout the book that make it a non-stop thriller for any comics fan: the re-imaginings of Wonder Woman, Bizarro, and Green Lantern are excellent but the Russian Batman takes the cake for best alternate take on a legend. Red Batman is an urban terrorist living in the sewers, going to extremes to destroy the invincible Superman and in one momentous scene reminiscent of Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", he almost does it before doing something extreme even Miller's Batman didn't.<br /><br />\\"Red Son\\" is easily one of the best Superman books out there and might be the best thing Mark Millar's ever written. He's on top form throughout, his imagination fizzing off of the page from one breath-taking set-piece to the next, aided by amazing art from Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett throughout, crescendoing in a completely unpredictable and inspired conclusion. This is a must-read for all superhero fans but it's also an excellent piece of dystopian fiction for readers who don't normally read comics. Highly recommended.ext, aided by amazing art from Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett throughout, crescendoing in a completely unpredictable and inspired conclusion.

B001ATN3QS|5.0|A well rounded cast of leading stars, this western doesn't fail to entertain or keep one on the edge of their seat. It's hard to believe that SILVERADO is approaching 30 years since released, and already has celebrated it's \\"Silver\\" anniversary. With strong performances by the likes of Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner, Jeff Goldblum, Brian Denheny, among others, this late 19th century set period western surely separates the good guys from the bad. Great action, great acting, and obviously excellent direction for all performances to be strong and never a dull or sleepy moment. This is a great Western movie of it's time, and, bodes well to hold it's own in this often hit or miss genre. SILVERADO delivers just what everyone who loves westerns seeks. It is even great as a main-stream movie, and, the story, plot, and several climaxes does this movie great justice. I recommend this movie to any and all regardless that it is now 27 years since being released. For some, this was a big moment in the careers of actors and actresses alike, and, I believe this was the first big movie for Costner. Sit back and enjoy, this movie will NOT disappoint!

B007MDB71O|5.0|Without Burroughs' original John Carter novels, much of today's science-fiction genre wouldn't exist.<br />That said, pay no heed to the critics who complain that this is all stuff we've seen before in Star Wars and Avatar; Lucas and Cameron have both said that they were fans of the John Carter books, though I doubt either bothered to add that they also borrowed heavily from them for their own works. The bit I love is that they're claiming that the century-old John Carter series (the majority of the source-material for this film was originally published in 1912) borrows heavily from the 30+ years old Star Wars, and the much younger Avatar. If these critics aren't going to bother getting their facts straight before going to publication, then I believe that we shouldn't bother listening to them; why should we listen to the \\"intellectually-disadvantaged\\" when choosing our entertainment? Seriously, those folks need to be fired; trained gibbons on meth could do a better job than ANYONE who claims that the much older story borrows from the infinitely more recent. These people would say that the ancient Greeks stole a lot from 'Clash of the Titans' when they wrote the tales of Perseus, Hercules, etc.<br />Having never been engaged by the Avatar-hype, I haven't bothered to see it, and therefor can't point out the bits that Cameron lifted, but there are many immediately-obvious \\"Lucas-inspirations\\": Padwars, Jeddaks, etc.<br />The TRUTH is that Stanton did an incredible job of bundling up this initial installment of the Chronicles of Barsoom into a nice stand-alone story that appeals better to 21st Century societal mores than a literal interpretation would have done, and in so doing, fails to tread too harshly on Burroughs' toes. The biggest 'For Instance' that leaps to mind would be that the Barsoomians in the movie wear clothes; in Burroughs' books, they wore only those nifty leather and steel harnesses. Additionally, the screen-writers gave John Carter a little more back-story to make him a slightly more 3 dimensional character.<br />I love the books, I loved the movie, and I'm horrified at the treatment it has received from the Critics that worked so effortlessly to make this masterpiece a stand-alone story; the John Carter/Chronicles of Barsoom would have made Disney a MINT if they hadn't so thoroughly botched the marketing campaign.<br />Buy this movie - chances are very good that you'll enjoy it thoroughly, unless you prefer to have the gibbons choose what you like and don't like...story to make him a slightly more 3 dimensional character.<br />I love the books, I loved the movie, and I'm horrified at the treatment it has received from the Critics that worked so effortlessly to make this masterpiece a stand-alone story; the John Carter/Chronicles of Barsoom would have made Disney a MINT if they hadn't so thoroughly botched the marketing campaign.<br />Buy this movie - chances are very good that you'll enjoy it thoroughly, unless you prefer to have the gibbons choose what you like and don't like...

B004O3YGMC|1.0|this was a terriable app. and a terriable expeirence! the appp equires the gmail  account from google. it would never sign in!<br />i could never get it to sign in to my google account! you cannot contact the company ! what a bust. it was all here . google said they could help me figure it out but for 15 bucks!<br />i found anoter remote app<br />TEAMVIEWER on here in the amazon app store. and it was free. had it up and running in no time. i wanted it for games. it works. the only hitch is background sounds. there arent any. its made for confernce calls but can be used in a at home non commercial user capacity.<br />it does what it says and it did not require it be syncrinized to anything!<br />i put my kindle on the google side for registration of the app and usage. i did it make it a 2 step authentication process to access the google account when i sign in from my kindle for security reasons. you must list a phone number  with google to set up the 2 step authentication. they will call the number with a code for the kindle to sign in. the code is sent as soon as you attempt to sign in. your kindle will hold it in memeory. its really pretty easy to install and use the Teamviewer app.<br />i feel ripped off from splashtop. id never recc0mmend this app. and im out 4.99 plus tax!!
B0074QGGK6|2.0|I don't remember buying this book and can't find it on my shelf either. So this review has been written on the same basis as someone decides whether to buy the book or not.<br />I guess a lot depends on what you think an artist is. Austin seems to have a similar idea to the one I have - an artist uses their creativity (whatever you understand that to be) in conjunction with visual material. A musician is similar except they use sounds. A writer uses words. And so on.<br />However I did not detect any clear understanding of what creativity is - just some examples. They are fine as far as they go.<br />If you are interested you might have a look at the first of my books in a collection about developing creativity skill. I doubt if Austin thinks of creativity as something you can develop skill in - but he might. [[ASIN:B007S1LH92 Program One: Sealed Orders (SPACE Art Education - coach collection)]]

0345803485|5.0|OMG! Seriously one of the best reads I have read in a long time. I heard the controversy and to be honest you need to read it before you judge because it's all BS!<br />It was HOT and had me cry twice in book two and fall for the characters- all of them)<br />Christian is a broken man from a terrible childhood and Ana is an young woman who helps him grow and mend. Together they grow through the intricacies of their lives, past and present and I tell you a few times I was too scared to read further because I didn't want their relationship to go through anything more but they needed it to grow together and I as a reader was addicted.<br />I bought one and then finished it and within two minutes bought number two and the same happened with three.<br />I'm not an erotica reader as such but this series had me panting for more.<br />Please, don't judge by rumors, Judge for yourself. Grab the free sample and if you are not hooked by the end of that then this book i plainly not for you but may be for others.<br />Happy and hot<br />Kez
0307454568|5.0|Larsson's trilogy is an interesting trilogy.  The story is compelling and the characters are fun, if a bit over the top.  The write leaves a little to be desired, but after all is said and done I found that I loved the trilogy!  Hornet's Nest is the best of the three.<br /><br />The story takes off directly after the end of book 2 with Lizbeth being flown to the hospital.  Its hard to believe that a story could be written with Lizbeth confined to a hospital bed thus removing her from the story for the most part, but this makes everything all the more interesting.  Instead you have Mikael taking the lead and being the driving force to vindicate the victims of the world, Lizbeth in this case.  There is just as much if not more intrigue and action as the other two books, so it is a quick fluid read that easily kept my interest.<br /><br />Even though a lot of the characters are over the top I found that I really enjoyed reading about each and every one of them, and Larsson did a wonderful job in making you hate the bad guys.  This is where this book shines because you get to see the culmination of books 1 and 2 into an all out attack against the bad guys and putting them away for good, vindicating Lizbeth.  This was what was what made this such an interesting read, watching how Mikael worked to get the evidence needed to trap and attack the bad guys.  Watching that unfold is just as satisfying as reading about  little Lizbeth beating up the big bad guys.  A definite recommend.<br /><br />5 stars.

0307970299|3.0|We listened to the tape on a girls road trip? For such a personal book, although we relate to Cheryl's story (she wrote it for girls like us didn't she?), the voice of the reader did not suit this \\"character\\" (Cheryl). A little too sophisticated perhaps? we immediately felt detached, as if someone was reading us a story, not telling us HER STORY. In comparison, we had just finished Tina Feys Bossypants on cd, in her own voice, her own inflection, emotions, opinions and we ate it up! Surely there was a good reason for Cheryl not reading her own words,  but now  I wish I would have read it in hardback instead of listening to a (very excellent) performer read it. If Cheryl ever records it, love to listen again!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Not only did I love the book, the Author Walter Isaacson is terrific.  Steve, in his own right was quite a character. I could not put the book down, and<br />was sorry when I finished it, I wanted to read more.  This \\"Genius\\" of a man taught me so much just reading about his personality, and the way he figured things out.  I intend to read many more books about him. What a tremendous loss to \\"us\\" that he is gone.
B001HN6922|5.0|Cars 2, a cute follow up to Cars. The grand kids, ages 4 and 6 enjoy watching it over and over again. Good color and fast action.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When I heard about the \\"Trilogy\\" I was excited to read it.  I was disappointed, it wasn't exciting and I was able to put the book down.  The abusive part where she was beat with a strap was terrible, then went back for more physical abuse. Finally left the relationship unhappy, with no hope for a future.<br />I suppose I should read \\"50 Shades Darker\\" but I was so upset with her, I am not sure if I will.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles Stereo Box Set, What a great gathering of all the Beatles DVD's. You sit for hours and listen to their music and hear how they have grown. A great relaxing trip down memory lane.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Wanted to check this app out for the price. FREE it says, right in the title description. I clicked on \\"One-Click\\" purchase, and it said I now owned it. Sweet! So, I look for it on my iPad. It's not there. Upon closer inspection, it says I can find it in my app store. I go looking for it, and all that is there is the option to buy it for $3 in the app store.<br /><br />That's pretty misleading from what I expected. I do NOT own the game. It is NOT on my device, and it is NOT free.<br />It's also gotten some pretty scathing reviews now that I have looked deeper.<br />How unfortunate.

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|My grandson came over for the weekend and we always try to have something to do or to watch together.  We got this movie and we all enjoyed it.  It is certainly a children's movie and my grandson enjoyed it.  It has a good soundtrack and the animation was very well done.<br /><br />It did seem to have a strong environmental spin to it but we got it for the entertainment and it made for a nice time to spend watching a movie that was cute with several good characters.  As an adult, for me, it was OK and I don't liked to be preached to by Hollywood about their political agenda but my grandson doesn't see that.  All he sees is cute characters that can dance and sing.<br /><br />He thoroughly enjoyed it and for that it is worth 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really cool game jst to play when  you're  bored. i recommend this game to anyome. so give it a try.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Loved playing this game until out of nowhere everything reset to 188 hours. I don't know why this happened but its ruined the entire game
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game great short film occasional lull may get board overall great game could use a little more things to do while waiting. . .add additional short videos
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Once this game was started, it worked fine until my son tried to increase the volume.  It would not give you any of the standard options:  home, back, sound or messages.  To get out of the app, we had to shut down the kindle fire.  We started it again hoping it was just a problem with startup, but again, we had to shutdown just to get out of the app.  Not worth it if it forces you to stay in the program.
0439023491|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire Hunger Games series. The books were well written and a quick read<br />I was, however, disappointed by the Movie. In my opinion, the casting was all wrong for Peeta and Gale. The books described Peeta as a larger bodied person and of course the Movie portrayed him as a \\"weakling\\"<br />He was supposed to be a tough guy, don't know what happened there.<br />I also thought the Movie was rather slow, boring at times.<br />Love Katniss, just love her.

0307593495|2.0|In general I enjoyed this book for its innovative plot and because I happen to like Swedish crime fiction. I find it interesting to compare the somewhat bumbling fictional Swedish police to the impossibly astute American detectives of the same genre, and the fact that investigative procedures that apparently work in Sweden would never fly in the U.S.<br /><br />However, I gave \\"The Troubled Man\\" only two stars because, as others have already stated, I found the ending to be completely unsatisfactory. Too many loose ends left dangling, too many questions unanswered, too unlikely a solution to the crimes committed--almost as if Mankell became bored with his own creation and wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible. I could live with the end of the Wallander series. What I find unforgiveable is the way I was sucked in by an otherwise decent novel, only to be left thinking, \\"What the hell...?\\" when presented with so amateurish and unpolished an ending. It made me wonder whether it is in fact Mankell, not Wallander, who has developed Alzheimer's.
B000002C1V|3.0|This is a dreary, depressing, self indulgent CD but it definitely has it moments.<br /><br />At the time there was a strong sense that Roger Waters was taking the opportunity to stick the knife into Pink Floyd and give it a little twist. It certainly guaranteed the bitter rift between Waters and Gilmour.<br /><br />I followed Pink Floyd from the earliest days and watched them in small clubs in London before they hit the big time. Pink Floyd's work is divided into clear phases. The first, with Syd, was psychedelic, electronic and was very typical of the era - nothing truly standout, but with a level of musical excellence that was uncommon in those raw, early days. I liked several of the instrumentals but had Syd Barrett not left Pink Floyd, no-one would remember them today.<br /><br />The second phase started with Dark Side and ran through to The Wall. The music was sophisticated, soulful, deep, and utterly inspired. Wish you were here, and Animals were theme oriented with many of the anthem quality songs that appeared with decreasing regularity right to the very end of Pink Floyd. This was the classic music of the progressive rock scene and no-one ever came close to emulating their mastery.<br /><br />The Wall was really the beginning of the end. Yes, it is much feted today, but has only four fundamental songs of any note, and a lot of musical dross. The Final Cut demonstrated just how out of touch Waters had become with the real world. The music is scrappy and the lyrics discordant with the times. Waters lambasts Thatcher at the very moment Britain was enjoying a brief, final resurgence of national pride in sending the Argentine invaders packing. It just felt wrong. If I met Waters at the time I would've said \\"you made your point with The Wall... the Final Cut just wasn't necessary\\".<br /><br />And that, fundamentally, was the end of Pink Floyd, skewered on the altar of Roger Waters ego, circling down to a hole in the ground. Curses.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I can't quite understand why the critics slammed this movie so bad because I thought it was truly great. The directing and camera work were great and the special effects were amazing. I never got bored or lost interest in the movie. It kept me wanting more. The acting was superb. The chemistry between Kitsch and Collins was just right and I felt like I knew all the charcter when it was over. I have not read the book and now I plan to. A great movie that I would recommend everytime!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Though a lot of it was fairly telegraphed, you have to be emotionally dead to not be moved by the movie. Very enjoyable.

I just really like to knit with<br />circulars, especially on a plane so I'm not apt to lose one of my 4 double pointed needles.<br />Shows basic chart knitting if you need a refresher or are a newcomer to that method of following a pattern.<br />Patterns for potholders, bags and hats are included.<br />Love just the different patterns and am thinking of another baby afghan I have to make this week looking at the diamond pattern vs. the one I am currently using will be a nice selection.<br />Always am telling my blind friend that you can knit with needles and make  a circle but that you'd have to then sew up the seam-she can't do the circulars but this book gives me another idea on how to achieve it.<br />Shawls and scarves, socks and mittens and gloves, vests and sweaters. Something for everybody in this book, beginning or experienced knitter.<br />Other abbreviations, glossary and index are at the back of the book.
B003B02O0A|4.0|This book was just as entertaining as the movie. I always love to read a novel that has been turned into a movie. So much is left out of the movie or rearranged for entertainment sake. I love this book.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit I didn't have any idea who this artist was until I heard a cut from this CD while watching \\"Mob Wives\\" (yeah, I admit it) a couple of weeks ago. I immediately got on the net and when I heard all the songs, I fell in love with this CD right away. Obviously, it was a must-have for me.  I'm really feeling all this retro-soul music right now and have been buying it up like crazy. I actually don't know how I'm just now discovering Mayer Hawthorne but I'm so glad I did. This one is a really good addition to my collection and I would definitely recommend it. Check it out.

0439023521|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" and following books in the trilogy are fast paced and extremely engaging, however its rating of \\"young adult\\" may be slightly young for many readers.  The violence and \\"sex appeal\\" are not sensationalized in the trilogy which gives the book a definite plus, but for many children under the age of 14, may be too graphic (depending again on the child).  The real reason behind my opinion of this series being wrongly rated is the political undertones.  Knowing from my own personal experience, I would not have picked up on the political undertones when I was even 15, but at 24 they stand out even greater than the teen romance which many people seem to focus on.  I seriously recommend this book, and series, to parents (who should read it before their children to get a feel for the severity of the messages).
B004NSULHM|2.0|King of Limbs has only 8 songs on it, which suggests that those 8 songs form a strong whole. Sadly, they don't. KOL is probably Radiohead's weakest release. The music is vague and rarely engaging at all, and that is definitely not something you can say about any other album of theirs (even Hail to the Thief, while a disjointed album, had memorable melodies).<br /><br />On King of Limbs, as it stands, only the songs \\"Codex\\" (simple and beautiful) and \\"Give Up the Ghost\\" (mystique and interesting) make any sort of impression on me. I appreciate and respect that Radiohead are continually developing their sound (In Rainbows was a real triumph), but King of Limbs is, for the most part, very forgettable. Most of the record plods along without anything to really capture the listener's imagination and/or intrigue apart from the palette of sounds. In Rainbows is also a laid-back record but the songwriting is just much stronger on that record than here. King of Limbs never gets going, and I would call it B-side material if Radiohead didn't have some great B-sides in their catalogue (particularly from the Kid A era). It's as if it doesn't dare to really become anything special.<br /><br />King of Limbs is only for the completionist, an alright, easy listen with some experimental instrumentation but not the songwriting to tie it together. Not one of Radiohead's better offerings at all, especially after 4 years; it's essentially a glorified EP.<br /><br />If you are looking for a slow, introvertive album of secrets, I recommend R&ouml;yksopp's \\"Senior\\". That album is also under ten tracks, only far more memorable and distinct than KoL. Better luck next time, Radiohead.
0439023513|4.0|This review contains some spoilers.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this trilogy, so much so that I read all three books in just a few days after seeing the Hunger Games film. The books are very well paced and the story always interesting. This is reflected in the four-star rating I have given to the book. On the whole I would give the series the highest marks.<br /><br />But I have to say, which seems to be the general consensus, that the way the series ended left me a bit disappointed. Collins created a very compelling story about survival and triumph against soul-crushing oppression, and more than anything created a very powerful, attractive character in Katniss Everdeen. This was a young woman who kept her family alive when her father died, who was endlessly resourceful and self-sufficient, who volunteered to save her sister from the Hunger Games, who triumphed against all odds in the arena while keeping her humanity and in doing so defying the all-powerful Capital, whose very example and decency would spark a revolution. Yet in the end it was like the author turned against her hero. I tore through the book waiting and waiting for some emotional payoff, for Katniss to finally achieve some measure of well deserved reward for all her trials, and it never happens. Katniss spends much of the final book emotionally crippled and hospitalized. Peeta is turned into a shell of his former self by the Capital who is programmed to hate the very sight of her. Katniss never gets to exact justice against Snow, the evil leader of the Capital. And Katniss is made to be just a pawn serving the whim of the District 13 leader, Coin, who is just as potentially evil. Topping it off, the author almost gratuitously kills off Katniss's sister. Not only did this seem like overkill, but it also takes away from Katniss's final act of heroism, assassinating Coin to protect the nation from trading one tyranny for another. What should have been an act of heroism is now transformed into anact of personal vengeance. Finally, what can we make of Katniss, having survived the dehumanizing cruelty of the arena twice, voting to subject the families of the Capital's leaders to the same cruelty? Maybe this was tactical, to disarm Coin as Katniss resolved to assassinate her, but it's done in such an ambiguous way that it needlessly chips away at Katniss's fundamental decency, the quality that for me drove the whole trilogy.<br /><br />I understand the need to balance fairy tales against realism, the horrors of war, the price of battling oppression, etc. It would have been unrealistic to have Katniss emerge completely unscathed from such an ordeal. But did the author really need to leave her scarred, emotionally crippled, abandoned and unheralded after all her heroism and sacrifices? In the end Katniss loses her home, her friends, her sister, her mother, Gale, is shot, burned, declared insane and is left living like a pariah in isolation in the charred remains of District 12, marrying the broken and equally discarded Peeta and living her life seemingly forgotten by the nation she saved. Did she even get a medal? Argue all you care to that there is some deeper philosophical meaning to all this. Maybe there is even a profound meaning in the reader being left to see the injustice of it all. But speaking as a card carrying member of the gritty realism school, forgive me for thinking that Katniss and the reader deserved a less depressing ending. Call me old-fashioned, but a main character as compelling as Katniss deserved a better fate. It is hardly giving in to the childish temptation of a fairy tale ending for the reader to ask for an ending that is less relentlessly grim towards the hero of the whole story.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|Worth watching at least once, for different reasons.<br />I like it.<br />There are thousands of movies that should never have been funded and made .<br />This is not one of them.<br />I do not understand why its director and its 3 main stars did not like the final product.<br />I think it is well made , well acted, well paced and 'logical' (did not stretch my suspension of disbelief too much) .<br />Is this film well made due to the power of its editors? In spite of its director?<br />I think this would be a movie through which I can learn the power of an editor because the final product seems created by its editors, to the chagrin of its director and its 3 main stars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I first played this on my iphone but the screen was just too small for my liking. So I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and its so much better! The graphics seem clearer also.
0345803485|1.0|Having noticed the 1000 + reviews for this novel I assumed it must have something good going for it.  The title brought to mind something from the Civil War.  Hah!  I soon realized the error of my ways but soldered on thinking it must have some redeeming qualities.  I didn't find a one.  It was a complete waste of time and money.  I also found that if you read enough reviews you  will pretty much know what happens in the sequels.<br />Beyond the trilogy sequel:  Ana has decided she really wants a sex change and proceeds with the process.  Christian has already made it abundantly clear he has no interest in being gay.  He decides to become a priest and is assigned as counselor to a convent/novitiate.  Their child is sent to Somalia to live with distant cousins.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is not my typical read. I am more James Patterson, Stuart Woods, Harlan Coben but this came across my email as a suggestion. I had just finished the Hunger Games Trilogy, which again is not my type of read but I loved it. So decided to try this. Again, I am glad I did. As hard as it is for me to even fathom having sex so often and the multitude of \\"pleasures\\", I would not say this was like porn. These 2 are genuinely attracted to each other but lead very different lives when it comes to passion/sex or whatever you want to call it. Definitely not what I would call a Harlequin romance novel, but better! I have downloaded book 2 and it is awaiting me on my Kindle. Can't wait to get started! Don't judge a book by it's \\"cover\\".

B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a unique program that allows you to create and generate music of your own design. You can place notes onto the field of the page and even insert nodes that allow you to play multiple notes at the same time. This is a fun app to play with and it can create some interesting results.<br /><br />Just selecting one note and sliding your finger up and down the screen can create a moog synthesized song that has a Zen like quality. Using this app has very remarkable effects and entertaining to use. It states on Amazon that shaking your device clears the screen but on my Kindle Fire it does not work.<br /><br />I am certainly a novice at creating music but I have fun using this app!

I believe most of the hate is coming from scifi fans who were expecting this show to be some groundbreaking alien epic/masterpiece like Battlestar Galactica. I can understand how folks might have felt with such high standards when they finally watched this show at first.  But if you still hated it after a few eps then why watch?  I don't mean to sound rude but if you still don't like this show then go find something else to watch.  There are quality scifi shows like Fringe & Awake on tv that desperately need ratings. Go help them out instead of spending time complaining about the ones that don't meet your standards.<br /><br />Anyways...Falling Skies is a very compelling, if somewhat flawed, survival drama set in an alien post apocalypse. It's not groundbreaking but some of the ideas presented are good and with time may become amazing.  The resistance fighters remind me of the group in the original V miniseries (the excellent one made in the 80s). The aliens have taken out the major cities & hit down the military in their first wave of attacks. Now it's up to non-military people to help fight. That means even teens will have to carry guns and fight.<br /><br />Noah Wylie is a great lead and the actors playing his sons are good also. I like the father/son relationship between Tom and Hal. Most shows would have Hal being rebellious & hateful of his father. That is a cliché that this show actually avoids & in some ways subverts.  Hal is supportive of his father most of the time and voices his opinions maturely instead of being a brat. The teen son on V (2009) was awful in comparison. Also, the teen son of Terra Nova was no better.<br /><br />I also really like the female characters on the show. I love the Walking Dead but you have got to admit that Falling Skies has way better female characters.  I am thankful there is no one like Lori on this show.<br /><br />Moon Bloodgood plays a doctor named Anne and potential love interest for Tom.  She is a great character. Instead of  weeping and going on about the loss of her family, she focuses on doing what she can for the group & helping others.  I love that the writers don't push the romance between her character and Tom. They have some light banter and these really nice quiet moments that are more meaningful. These moments evolve during the first season that will most likely lead to romance in the second season.<br /><br />These are just some of the elements that make this show pretty entertaining. You have characters that are relatable despite cliché, ongoing mystery about the aliens, good cgi, and the usual post-apocalyptic drama.  I would definitely recommend this show especially if you've liked the Walking Dead, Jericho, or Spielberg's other alien miniseries Taken.
B0061S0A64|5.0|At first try my thought was. &quot; Oh this is neat..sure. Fun to mess with. Kids will love it.&quot;<br />Then I actually played with all the settings. And I must say. It is incredible what you can do with this app. I mean hardcore music producers could make great music with this... its that good. Heck.. kids could easily stumble into a great melody with this. Heh. Amazing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|everything is fine besides the ads.. DO NOT DO THE UPDATE.. it erased every game I got,but I still play it cause its a good waste of time.

B0061S0A64|5.0|Got this morning as the aotd, and had I know about this app before I would have gladly paid for it. An entertaining beatmapping app with tons and tons of options and functions. By no means am I a producer, but even a new user can make an interesting beat very easily and have fun doing it and figuring out all the features.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Obviously the first 3 films are 5 stars. The 4th film, I would give a 3 star rating Just my opinion, we could have done without Kingdom of The Crystal Skull.  My guestion is, When these films were released in a 4-disc Ultimate Collection DVD, is it actually worth upgrading these films on the Blu-Ray format. The price of $74.99 is a bit high for these films, but like I said Indiana Jones I, II and III were spectacular and flawless and still hold up 31 years after the release of Raiders.  Does anybody know what special features are going to be available on this Blu-Ray collection?  Thank You in advance for responding.  Also, I do own a 52\\" Sony HDTV, and I also have a Blu-Ray player.  I still have a VHS player and a DVD player.  I really don't care what format a movie will be released on to.  I have been a film buff for the past 25 years.  I own 5,006 movies.  286 on Blu-Ray, 2,996 on DVD and 1,724 on VHS.  I have also watched thousands of films that I don't own.  Since the Indiana Saga is finally being released on Blu Ray, I sure hope Universal release E.T. on Blu-Ray.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|this movie was just as good as the first one.  Kenny Wormack (sp?) was great - the girl way better in my opinion than the one from the first movie.  They kept the music the same so I still loved it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun. wish the energy didn't run out so quick though..<br />its a mix of the classic and farmville. great for kids
B000GCFO0S|5.0|Compared to alot of the other video game to movie adaptations, this one really hits the nail on the head, with having the same creepy, scary, oppressive atmoshere that the games had. Very well done prodecution quality as well.
B0061S0A64|5.0|this is by far the most zen app i have played with. downloaded it and 20 min. later realized i had been sucked right in.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|I understand the Polish (original) edition of this Album was #1 in Poland for a very long time.  Well, it's no wonder.  This is a VERY special album - one that comes around only so often.<br /><br />It's certainly THE go to CD at my house!  I'm a long time Metheny fan, andt this blend/reinterpretation takes his music to another level.  The musicians that come to the table from Jopek's band are all amazing.  Jopek's creative use of and control of her voice is marvelous!<br /><br />Many of the songs are literally breathtaking, just stunningly beautiful.  I listen to a broad range of music from baroque to the latest stuff - I can't think of any that encourages me to stop what I'm doing and just listen more than this.  In the sense that it puts you 'in the moment' with the music and all other concerns fade away, it can be a spiritual experience for me in addition to the musical one.  Finally, the musical lines are so stirring and transcendent, I find this album just puts a smile on my face.  What more can you ask for?<br /><br />If you like fusion/jazz, and lyrical melody lines, and want to try something different than you've heard before, you can't go wrong with this one!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It helps pass the time in a fun way and the grandson loves it.  I would recommend it.  The graphics are really sharp.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a very fun game. you actually find out what happened to the the people after the original Oregon trial game becuause you pick
0452277752|5.0|In newer editions of this collection, King's first Bachman Book, Rage, is omitted.  Stephen King took it out of print because of its similarity to the Columbine tragedy and the fact that at least one of the shooters cited it as an \\"influence\\".  I understand King's reluctance to keep the story in print, but I also believe everyone is responsible for their own actions, and that we can't blame art for the decisions people make.  For that reason, even though it's not as easy to find and may cost a little more, I recommend finding a copy of the original that has Rage as well as the other three novels.  Now, enough with the editorial.  Here are a few notes on each story.<br /><br />Rage--A brutally honest, if somewhat naive, look at what makes teenagers tick.  In public schools, a single classroom holds such a complex mixture of personalities, moods, and motivations, that it's a wonder schools are functional at all.  I find it interesting, though, that in today's society, the extreme insecurities and pressures the students in Rage operate under might be better suited to middle school than high school. Nonetheless, the senseless shootings stemming from social alienation proved prophetic, and the warning should not be ignored.<br /><br />The Long Walk--King predicts that our increasing bloodlust in entertainment will lead to a show where an audience watches a group of young men from poor families try to outwalk one another.  Everyone dies but the winner, who earns fame and fortune.  Needless to say, this is a bleak novel with a pessimistic view of humanity.<br /><br />Roadwork--I think this is the oddball of the group.  The protagonist is a man adrift, a middle-aged laundry worker who has to give up the house and workplace he cherishes so a new highway extension can be built right through them.  He falls into a deep depression, lies to his wife and bosses, and basically self-destructs.  After some alarming personal adventures, he decides to take his fate into his own hands.  In some ways, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival.  It's quite a bit different from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film that was based on it; it's much more dark and gritty.  Given the way it ends, I'm almost surprised King didn't pull it out of print along with Rage after another certain national tragedy, but I guess the circumstances were different enough not to merit doing that.<br /><br />These four novels have nothing whatsoever to do with the supernatural, as King was using his pseudonym early on as a vehicle to write and publish fiction outside of the expectations he had created under his own name.  Surprisingly, despite his other novels having monsters, ghosts, and demons, these stories have less mainstream appeal and seem more like a young author trying to be literary.  And achieving it, in my opinion.  All four of these books are dead serious, and delve deeply into their characters' psychological underpinnings.  Before he died from \\"cancer of the pseudonym,\\" as King calls it, Bachman did branch out into King territory with his next and last book, Thinner, but the early ones are in their own category.  For a different take on Stephen King's writing talents, and maybe an appreciation for his diversity and ambition as an author, give The Bachman Books a read.In some ways, his journey reminds me of John Smith from The Dead Zone.<br /><br />The Running Man--Again, King looks into his crystal ball, and this time sees a future game show in which convicted violent criminals run from armed stalkers with, once again, fame and fortune as the prize for survival.

0345803485|1.0|The only reason I endeavor to finish reading this book is because it was selected for my book club, although I'm sure it will not inspire in-depth conversation. The characters are not believable and generally obnoxious, particularly the protagonist Anastasia Steele. Her sex interest, Christian, is too young in my opinion to have the brooding, powerful personality the author wanted to assign to him. Often times the dialogue and behavior were inconsistent.<br /><br />the vocabulary of the novel is very irksome and repetitive (My inner goddess, my subconscious, ugh!) And it seemed the majority of the dialogue was being \\"murmured,\\" not a very sexy word in my mind and I became frustrated by it's frequency.<br />The descriptions of the sex scenes were pretty immature, but then, so was the rest of the book.<br /><br />I'm sure it's getting a lot of attention for bondage stuff and the very frequent sex scenes, but really? There must be some erotic fiction out there that has some realness and depth to it. This book is agonizing. Honestly, I don't see how they'll make it into a movie, except maybe straight to late night cinemax.
1469984202|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I thought I had something figured out but the author totally took it another way. The characters are well developed and I really enjoyed the many twists and turns. I can't wait for the movie! Congrats on a great book!
0439023521|5.0|Katniss, is a sixteen year old girl who lives in a future world as part of a conquered and enslaved people.  She secretly hunts to keep her family fed, knowing it is a crime, but she has no other options.  She is determined her family will survive, but the day to day is such a struggle, she never thinks beyond to the future until her friend Gale starts talking about it, but by then it is already too late.<br />The hunger games are about keeping a conquered people poor, demoralized and controllable.  The slaughter is reminiscent of the ancient gladiator games, mixed with as many cruelties as imaginable.  Two children between the ages of twelve and eighteen are drawn by lots from each of twelve districts for the games and it is hyped and televised like a gruesome parity of the Olympics.  Within the game's frame work survival strategies, emotional issues, moral dilemmas and luck, all play a part.  The last child left alive gets to return home and live well for the rest of their lives.<br />The tale is gritty, but is also at times heartwarming.  There are also the nice, likeable grownups that are part of the conqueror's world, whose job it is to help their charges win by coaching them in the killing of their own kind.  Even their friends in the games are their enemies.  The Hunger Games themselves are so carefully thought out that they bring out the best in all, for the worst of purposes.  This is a story that will live in your head long after you have read the last page.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|From the first page to the very last word, I was hooked!!! A world where everything has changed not only in the landscape but even the emotions people have. However the human spirit is never quashed and The Hunger Games reveals that. An amazing literary experience, a book I will be thinking about for a long time.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|So, I watched 4 seasons in 2 weeks, that is how good this show is.  But just reading the reviews, Aaron Paul, or Jesse, does not get enough credit.  While Bryan Cranston is simply amazing, Paul does not get enough credit.  For me, he makes the show.  He absolutely nails his character.  Critics have said this is perhaps the best TV drama, crime thriller in the history of television... I kinda tend to agree.  While Dexter and Sopranos is just unbelievably good, this is a whole other level.  Primarily because it's unpredictable, the writing is off the charts superb (as is the acting) and the complexities and the depth of the characters is unparalleled in TV history, IMO.  Oh yea, and Saul Goodman.  Probably one of my favorite TV characters of all time.  The show is that good.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|computer used to hang up every hour, due to overheating, while i played a game, i installed the cooler master, problem its gone, i think it was sort of overkill really, this thing its huge, but it fits on a medium case, satisfied 100%
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are addicting!  I was unsure if this was \\"my thing\\" at first since I am more of a crime/mystery reader but after the 1st couple chapters I was hooked.  It is easy to fall in love with the characters and I found myself rooting for one then the other pretty consistently throughout the series.  I would recommend these books to anyone, truly I think most would find them enjoyable (and the majority will love them) plus they are very easy reads.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Lol. Sure the key size will be small if you don't install it on a kindle fire.  I think the people with the negative reviews just don't get it.  This app is well made with extra large key's.  Easy to read with good graphics.  I like that it remembers everything you input into it.  Great App!  Just understand that it's made for the kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book after hearing several respected TV personalities raving about it.  It was a waste of money and time.  I did finish the first book in the series, only because I hate to start a book and not finish it, but I will certainly not read the rest of the series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The kids and I love playing the games!!!! They love to try to unlock more and more games!!!! It is great to take everywhere to play!!!!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|This movie is a travesty. I bought it unseen because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and I anticipated a great story about a great lady and one of the best Prime Ministers Britain has ever had. Instead what I got was an insult to the memory and history of this woman. The movie focuses far too much on her illness after she retired from government service, and very little on the substance and successes of her time in office. I'm sure Meryl Streep deserved her Oscar for her acting since she was very convincing as the Margaret Thatcher I remember in office, but she's not responsible for the content and the ridiculous way the movie kept jumping about from one time period to another. If you are buying this as a historical portrait of a fine leader, then give it a pass. If it's a diary of a fallen heroine suffering the misery of senile dementia you're looking for then enjoy!
B007K3KO74|2.0|Musically it's crap.  I liked a majority of albums Madonna has put out but this one really just junk.  Repetitive, lacking passion to name a few things I dislike.  Really is too bad people write 5 stars just cause.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I finally got a chance to see this when my dvd arrived.  I watched it three times this weekend.<br /><br />There are many synopses of the film, so read another review for the plotline.  With Alexander Payne at the helm and George Clooney in the lead, I had very high expectations for this film.  The actual product even exceeded those expectations.  The characters drawn full and as we humans are, flawed.  I especially liked that the youngest child didn't fall into the cute and precocious trap that is the usual timeworn device for such.  The plotline is well-crafted and avoids the obvious cliches that this story could have easily fallen into.  The dialog is just about perfect.  These people talk like well, \\"real people.\\"<br /><br />There are a couple of hallmarks of the Alexander Payne films that I have seen that again are evident in this film.  One, very quickly the viewer knows who the characters are - I mean really KNOWS who these people are.  Payne is able carry this through many of the supporting characters as well.  I don't know how he does it, but his characters are established to the viewer very soon after they first appear.  The other thing Payne does is create almost unbelievable situations and make them seem feasible.  If we saw them written in a story or saw them realized in less-adroit hands, some of his plotlines would be laughable - and not in a good way. In Payne's hands, we simply accept them because he makes them so plausable within the context of the storyline.<br /><br />One of the most genius moves was to place this story in Hawaii. Against a backdrop most would consider the destination of a lifetime, yes, the denizens have the same problems, the same heartbreaks, the same joys those of us living in less-stunning settings do.<br /><br />There are some movies that I enjoy as I would an old friend, welcoming them back again and again.  The Descendants is on its way of entering that elite group.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|glitches: 153 bours for tomatoes? !?! Don't know how it got that way when things were fine before. Needs to be fixed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like all of the other positive reviews say, this game is definitely fun and relaxing with great music. I love puzzle games and trying to do things in as few moves as possible (Portal and Portal 2 :D) so this game was awesome. It was the free app of the day a few days ago and I snatched it up ASAP after seeing all the positive reviews. I played this game on a train ride for a good 30 minutes without getting bored. Give it a try!
1612130585|5.0|This is one of best books I have ever read! From the first sentence to the last you don't want to put it down. It has also incresed the romance in my marriage :)

B0055SWM08|5.0|Simply brilliant. Puzzles are well thought out and there are plenty of simple ones to provide hints to get you through the tough ones.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Ive been using evernote for a few months now and I think its awesome! I use it to help me remember thing both past and present.. little notes throughout the day.. I also copy and paste links from articles I like or would like to view later... if you have a mic you can do voice recorded notes and there are just so many options! My fab thing about it is when my kindle was destroyed and had to be replaced all my notes where still right here... hence the Ever in evernote... GET IT!
B0015F1VY8|1.0|I'm not very knowledgeable about directors, writers, and others in the industry but I'll give my unenlightened opinion anyway. The current \\"no child left behind,\\" uneducated generation excepted, most other kids learned about Elizabethan England and the Armada in the 7th grade, I know I did. This film was accurate about the armada being wrecked in a storm and that's about it. The rest was pure disappointing fantasy. How on earth could a director or producer expect an audience to buy into this already well known event in English history? The real Queen Elizabeth powdered her face white in the fashion of the day. One of her favorite swear phrases was, \\"God's death!\\" Where were these? And the sight of Elizabeth in Joan-of-Arc armor rousing the troops was actually too comedic for any halfway educated audience to swallow. The writers need to find another line of work. Truck repair or WalMart cashier come to mind. The director used every directing cliche' in the book. A real hack job. The Spaniards were depicted as Darth Vader villains, with dark clothes and mean looking faces.<br /><br />Nothing was good about this flop except for some of Cate Blanchett's acting, the costumes, and the cinematography. Those are the only reasons it deserves even one star<br /><br />But then, I really shouldn't complain because I bought this DVD stinker in a Goodwil store for 99 cents. The Cover art and data indicated it was history. I now know why it was there. I just regret wasting my time watching it.<br /><br />.

B007H7XJD4|1.0|Looks beautiful, but ridiculous dialogue and inane story. If you like greek mythology -- stay away. Names borrowed, but story has nothing to do with Theseus. Editing is a jumble of action sequences -- hard to discern who is doing what to whom. But it does indeed look gorgeous.

0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is an otherwise very interesting book with a very serious flaw:  what he calls the Warren Harding Mistake.  Gladwell makes the  point that appearances can be deceiving, which most of us have experienced.  But this example of Warren Harding is not a good one.  Underlying his argument is an implied assumption that Harding was campaigning for President in the post 1960 television age.  In 1920, most Americans still lived on farms and got their news delivered through the mail.  There was no radio or television.  Harding campaigned from his front porch like a Gilded Age candidate.  It's doubtful that most voters even knew what he looked like.<br /><br />Harding was elected President in 1920 by 60 per cent of the electorate.  It was one of the largest vote majorities in American history.  His predecessor, Woodrow Wilson, had been elected and reelected by narrow pluralities and helped by a divided Republican party in 1912.  After being reelected in 1916, Wilson led the country into World War I that began with a burst of patriotism but ended in dubious European diplomatic machinations and in anger and disillusionment.<br /><br />Gladwell  mentions polls of historians that rank Harding as among the worst Presidents in American History. The poll of historians Gladwell is probably referring  to is the 1962 poll commissioned by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.  President Kennedy was invited to participate because he was a published author of history,  Kennedy declined, because after one year in office, he said he understood the role events played in making or breaking a presidency.  Kennedy did comment, after seeing the results, he thought the poll had overrated Woodrow Wilson.<br /><br />What makes Harding's presidency the worst?  Well, no doubt his was the one where a foreign army invaded the United States and burned down the Capitol and the White House?  Wait a minute that was another President.<br /><br />The upshot of  Harding's presidency was this:  Harding died of congestive heart failure two years and five months into his Presidency,  just as the Teapot Dome scandal boiled over.  Coolidge assumed the Presidency upon Harding's death.  Coolidge appointed a bipartisan team of special prosecutors.  They indicted two cabinet officers.  One was convicted, the other acquitted. The acquitted cabinet officer was forced to resign by Coolidge.  Then he wrote a book blaming Harding for everything.  Harding was unavailable for comment.  Coolidge was elected to his own Presidency by 54 per cent of the vote in 1924.<br /><br />Where the historians saw idealism and nobility in Wilson, the electorate came to see megalomania and delusions of grandeur.  Where historians saw Harding as a small town, corrupt Babbitt (referring to the character in the eponymous Sinclair Lewis novel), the electorate saw a familiar gilded age politician who was probably corrupt but wasn't a threat to their life and limb.<br /><br />The real Warren G. Harding mistake here is in assuming that expertise is without bias.  I just don't agree that Harding is an example of looks deceiving the voters.  I think the voters knew exactly who Harding was and that was what they wanted.<br /><br />But Malcolm Gladwell is a very original thinker and the rest of Blink is well worth your time.g died of congestive heart failure two years and five months into his Presidency,  just as the Teapot Dome scandal boiled over.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game and kind of addicting. Others commented  that they  can't get out without shutting down the Kindle Fire.  I had the same problem!  Go to &quot;STUFF&quot; then hit options and the Kindle arrow will come up on the bottom. Now you can go back to your home screen without having to shut down your Kindle Fire.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This was a great movie that my girlfriend and I enjoyed. Some scenes were overly graphic. Definitely worth the time to watch.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Friends of mine insisted I watch this film. I knew nothing about Triangle and the experience blew me away. It was better because I really did not know what was going to happen. It reminded me of that film 'From Dusk Till Dawn' when half way through, the whole film suddenly turned down a road you did not expect. There is so much going on in this gem of a movie. I have seen it three times. Every time you notice something else. It is confusing at first but stay with it. I thought it was quite clever. Unfortunately not many people have seen it, it went under the radar.<br /><br />It stars Melissa George who used to be in `Home and Away' and you may have seen her in that brilliant television series `The Slap'. She is a very good actress. 'Triangle' is directed by Christopher Smith who gave us the excellent `Creep' which you may recall created a hostile atmosphere within the London UK underground system.<br /><br />The story is about Jess (Melissa George) who is confused, telling her colleagues (when they are all on a comfy little boat trip) she has been there before. Her confusion and concern is a great start to this film. I was a bit cocky watching this film, second guessing where the story was going, my advice is just go with the flow and do your best not to read anything before viewing. The bloody Blu-ray box cover  almost tells you everything! After the film I had some questions I needed answering, so I carried out some online investigation....if you do catch this great film and end up feeling slightly unintelligent and confused like I did, let me know and I'll put you right. As an actor myself I would love to work with Mr Smith the director, his imagination and sense of pace in a scene is dead on target for me. There are some respectful influences here from other films, let me know which ones you reckon they are. I recommend the Blu-ray version of course. By the way `The making of Triangle' is also interesting.<br /><br />My final words about this film is this: If you have experienced those dreams where you are running, but not going anywhere, or calling to someone for help and they can't hear you, and you are so close to them, screaming out with no response....that feeling of sheer frustration will ignite inside you when watching this thrilling film.....Just one question; why do you think the films title is named 'Triangle'?...after you see it let me know.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comou have experienced those dreams where you are running, but not going anywhere, or calling to someone for help and they can't hear you, and you are so close to them, screaming out with no response....that feeling of sheer frustration will ignite inside you when watching this thrilling film.....Just one question; why do you think the films title is named 'Triangle'?...after you see it let me know.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.com

B001MEJY8W|5.0|I am so excited to write about `Martyrs'. This is such a heavy film experience that is so thought provoking, bloody scary and incredibly imaginative. Do not be mislead by the strange DVD packaging. It does not represent the flavour of one of the most important extreme cinema films you may decide to watch. The DVD cover is far more gentle and diluted than the actual film. Perhaps it was a clever marketing decision.<br /><br />I really want to work with Pascal Laugier (Director). Seriously, the man is a genius. I'm sure he was going to direct the new `Hellraiser' project, but that's not going to happen now. It will be a pity if the rumour is true that `Martyrs' is going to be remade because it's subtitled. Bloody stupid. On the other hand, if `Hamlet ` the play and other same old same old shows are redone time after time in the theatre then why can't films also have a different interpretation of the same story? I want to do a remake of `Goodfellas', but set it in London, that would be awesome. I also want to remake `Westworld' with myself playing the part that Yul Brinner originally did. Anyway, that moment gives you all a little more salt n'pepper about me, now let's return to `Martyrs'.<br /><br />`Martyrs' ingredients: Have a dash of revenge, 28 large tablespoons of torture, a huge shot of humiliation, a quarter of realistic violence, half a pint of disturbing and disturbed characters, 53 tons of genuine terror, 40 grams of mental illness and 13 cups of the stuff nightmares are made of....then you are still not near to `Martyrs' achievement to deliver a very dark cloud of brutal episodes under one canopy.<br /><br />It's not one to see if you plan on having a romantic evening...if you have just started dating someone, you won't get a second date. I believe the film was shot in Canada because it's a french - canadian production.<br /><br />The film follows the journey of two woman played by Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi. One looks out for the other.<br />The Revenge aspect of the film is shocking and raw. The gore and terror is not the main core of this film. Yes, there are cutting edge films available to see...well this rare piece of creative art is not cutting edge it's bleeding edge. The films spiral was a real surprise. I had no way of knowing which direction this story was going. I felt my heart beating fast due to my adrenalin kicking in to prepare me and help me to recover from scene to scene. The twists and turns are imaginative and relentless.<br /><br />Mainstream films like `Saw 3,4,5,6,7' (whatever) and 'Final Destination' series take up the podium of popular horror for the majority. Oscar nominations and other festivals of recognition overlook films like `Martyrs', which I guess is a good thing in some respect because you feel special knowing about an underground horror film not everyone knows about. Yet the flipside is that there is little reward, apart from cult status.<br /><br />The talent of the two actresses in this film make several Hollywood leading actresses look very predictable and dull. The camerawork is sharp and on Blu-ray it's cinema -picture perfect - magic. The film combines many different horror categories very well. Remember when watching `Wolf Creek' when suddenly, like a flick of a switch, the plot follows another direction...'Martrys' executes this on more than one occasion in such a refreshing way.<br /><br />The torture scenes will test you. But don't switch off or fast forward because the scenes are relevant to the flow of the story. I thought at the time, in terms of a stunning and disturbing film, nothing can top this. But I was wrong when `A Serbian Film' came along. The difference between them is I could not watch `A Serbian Film' with anyone. With `Martyrs' I could watch again with people, no problem.<br /><br />I don't want to compare the two films because they are both very different, yet both are made without any compromise whatsoever to deliver stories that make you feel again. Expect that feeling to be anger or depression, the point to these films is that you actually feel something. When I think about the point of `Martyrs' I admire it. It's an intelligent adventure that has zero boundaries. I could write about this film for ages.<br /><br />Post me your thoughts on this one - I hope you get it and like the ending as much as I did. In a way I'm jealous if you have not seen it yet because I think it'll be a long time when I will be that disturbed again by an amazing piece of cinema that matters. Do one thing for me, if you plan to see this...set the tone, make sure it's dark inside and outside, turn your cell phone off and watch with surround sound if possible (or headphones) and don't let anyone interrupt you when you are watching. Then when the film is over stay alone in the dark and think about what you've seen then send me a message.<br /><br />`Martyrs' is the real extreme deal, so be prepared to feel damaged afterwards.<br /><br />Regards from the bleedingcritic, bleedingfilms.comn.

B0010X745K|5.0|I read 'The Mist' short story by Stephen King many many years ago.Frank Darabont, the director, wanted to make this film before but the technology required was not available so he made the stunning 'Shawshank Redemption' instead, also based on a short story by Mr King. This film has gone straight into my top 10 of all time. Yes, I absolutely love this story.<br /><br />Without giving too much away the plot focuses on a dad and his son who go out to the local store....For reasons unknown, you guessed it, a strange white mist appears everywhere. The performances from all the cast are spot on, great believable characters. The film was shot using three different cameras at times, so the actors did not always know where cameras were during some of the scenes. It feels like a claustrophobic play at times and the tension is terrific.<br /><br />For a study in crowd behaviour and paranoia this is an incredibly and carefully paced thrill ride. It's so much fun and keeps you well on edge. Again, try not to read anything beforehand because even on the back of the Blu-ray disk cover it mentions something you really don't want to know, because it might spoil your experience. In the Blu-ray version I have it has the film available to also watch in black and white, which I presume is a homage to those old B movies like 'Them' and 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (which, by the way, I am surprised has not been remade yet). You may be aware that Stephen King was disappointed about Stanley Kubricks version of 'The Shining' however he approved of 'The Mist'.<br /><br />There is a moment in 'The Mist' that Frank Darabont created, Stephen King himself said it was something he wished he thought of for his original story. If you see the film and are not sure which is the moment I refer to, just zap me an e-mail and I will explain. I think it stands out so much from the rest when you have good strong performances in a movie like this. It's a mix of talent that comes together so well. As an actor I wish I had a part in it, I would have been so proud to be in a delightful slice of entertaining scary horror. The script is solid as expected and it is such a change of direction for Frank Darabont. Keep an eye out for the actress Marcia Gay Harden. You may remember her in the Clint Eastwood Film 'Mystic River'. She is absolutely fantastic in this. Christ, after writing this review I might watch this film again, but in black and white this time. Enjoy and embrace this one!<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comctor I wish I had a part in it, I would have been so proud to be in a delightful slice of entertaining scary horror.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|When films explore the uncomfortable subjects of mixing up genetics, mutations, body distortion and playing dangerously with science you think of `The Fly' (1958 and again in 1986), David Cronenberg's The Brood (1979) and The Elephant Man (1980). I'm sure the shopping list of films is endless. Before watching this film, all I remembered from the media was the image of a creature with an human upper body, long tale and strange animal legs, nothing else. I noted Adrien Brody was starring so I presumed as he has been in some run of the mill action films this story will be fairly gentle and predictably safe.<br /><br />In the first opening scene the two experimental subjects look like giant fat penises, they are unimaginative in their design. However, we can overlook the first scene because we are drawn into a story that explores the consequences of an extreme gene splicing experiment. The journey begins with a truly disturbing living creation, subsequently showing us its perspective towards its own day to day isolation and captivity. The film also explores the huge emotional impact the secret experiment has on two scientists and the unforeseen issues. Canadian Actress Sarah Polley plays Adrien's partner and fellow scientist really well, so good casting here. I thought this film could easily have been written and directed by David Cronenberg. Vincenzo Natali who directed the original and claustrophobic `Cube' (1997) does an excellent job with Splice. This story experience is disturbing and incredibly moving at times. Yes, it has those irritating predictable scenes, however, the balance tends to lean towards images that deliver and get under your skin.<br /><br />The last couple of times I was blown away by creature effects was the facial expressions of Kong in Peter Jackson's `King Kong' (2005) and the ape character Ceacar in the incredible `Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (2011). Both characters body mapped from the excellent Andy Serkis. I like the actual creature effects here more because Splice hasn't had the attention the other two film have, so you watch it without the special effects must see marketing. The creature character is named Dren, her look and the way she interacts in her environments and physically moves around is cinema magic. The mix of real and digital effects is so realistic you actually forget that they are effects and just believe.<br /><br />Splice is the best mature film about DNA modification or the dangers of playing god. It is a surprising freaky number with some difficult to watch moments that will definitely hang on you afterwards. You will recognise the influences here from `Species', 'Eraserhead' and a host of others but don't let that put you off. Clear your head, be open and watch Splice late at night...and just make sure you check those dark corners, especially if you hear strange gutteral squeaks.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comects here more because Splice hasn't had the attention the other two film have, so you watch it without the special effects must see marketing.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I must admit I was hesitant to rent this movie at first because of the mixed reviews. I ended up renting it anyway, and cannot stop thinking about it, hours after I've watched it. I should caution you that anyone expecting some kind of formulaic Hollywood-type movie or a movie about 9/11 should just stop there. This movie is told in the perspective of a boy some kind of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). (In the movie, he says he was tested for Asperger's, but it was inconclusive or something like that). Although it is beautifully and thoughfully made, you honestly have to know someone with an ASD to FULLY appreciate this movie. I can say this because my own son has Asperger-like symptoms. SOO many times while I was watching this movie I was stunned that someone understood my son to a \\"T\\", down the very fine details like his fear for swings. I had to laugh when I saw the props in Oskar's room; my son has many similar things like that: huge map, space-themed banner, down to the \\"Moon-in-my-room\\" by Uncle Milton hanging on the wall LOL Someone did their research! ;)<br />So anyway, enough about ASD.<br />I just want to let people know that the previews they saw in the theatre for this movie is not an accurate portrayal of what this movie is really all about. Anyone expecting dramatic footage or something heart-wrenching should just go rent a 9/11 documentary or something. This movie does it much more subtly and symbolically. If you watch this movie with an open-mind, and take the whole 9/11 thing out of the whole equation, you'll probably enjoy it more. Think of it more as a journey of growth, by an unexpected protagonist. Anyone that still does not like the movie even reading my warning should just go \\"Succotash my Balzac, dip shiitake!\\" haha<br />One of the best, most thought-provoking movies I've seen all year!
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|I love the original John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). I remember staying in my seat in the cinema to watch it again. To take on this huge task of making a prequel is not easy because whatever film you create it's going to be compared to the original. It's even more difficult because you have to include discoveries from the original Norwegian facility and be sure to transfer them 30 years later.<br /><br />Directed by Matthijs Van Heijningen, who's industry background is commercials, television and this is his first major feature film. I liked the first few minutes, but from such a dramatic start you wonder how the three characters involved survived. There was no verbal or visual explanation, it was just ignored which was a little distracting. There is a lack of preparation with this production. In the 1982 original they discover many video tapes, all in Norwegian, this was brushed over because many tapes would indicate a long investigative time frame and this prequel ignores this major clue by being a little rushed. The other oversight is the way people interacted in the 1980's, especially towards women in the workplace. If they did the research by watching films of the time they could have picked up a few pointers to get the social aspect, look and feel, just right. I did not believe the story was set 30 years ago, it was a little 2011. The same has to be said for the look of the main female character `Kate Lloyd' (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who was John McLane's daughter in Die Hard 4.0).<br /><br />I have experienced conditions in Canada's winter where you can't walk around outside because you can feel the cold cutting into your face. Conditions in the Antarctic are far more extreme, the Norwegian outpost surroundings could have been more treacherous creating an unbearable claustrophobic environment. If you take on a project like this, which has such a cult following and great memories for so many, you need to have bleeding edge attention to detail in order to stand out best from the rest. I wanted this film to work so much and despite my observations and creative suggestions I did enjoy the ride. To be balanced there are explanations of direct links to the original which are brilliant. One is the huge empty ice block Kurt Russell finds in the original and the burnt two headed `thing' that they bring back for a post mortem. The other great moments are the fantastic creature effects. Today's special effects are pure magic and they morph match perfectly. We all love the fact the original was more hands on without computer generated effects, but it's all about the end result on screen and not how they got there. The story would have improved if it focused on the characters reactions and trauma to the unspeakable mutations and morphing happening before their eyes.<br /><br />The ending feels like a last minute attempt to tie things together and the spaceship scene destroyed the mystery of the original. However, this film is worth seeing because of the moments they get just right, especially when the `Thing' decides to make its appearances. If `The Thing' (2011) was a modern day, 30 years later, sequel it would have given the writers and producers a more creative blank canvas. The idea to create a prequel unfortunately set them up for a huge challenge where they failed, but all involved can certainly hold their heads up high for a brave effort in trying.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comer to stand out best from the rest.

B007C3TVNA|4.0|I had the anticipation of not knowing anything about this film and I've  been begged by friends to watch and write a bleedingfilms review. I presumed WNTTAK was set in the UK, about an anti establishment grumpy teenager with Tilda Swinton being the class actress ingredient giving this gritty controversial drama a stamp of importance. I was off target. Way off. The film is based on the novel by Lionel Shriver and is directed by the talented Lynne Ramsey. It's edited with flashbacks throughout mixed with the present day. A refreshing experience for the viewer that must have been a bitch to edit!<br /><br />John C. Reilly plays the father, I would have preferred a different unknown actor cast instead. You can believe that Tilda Swinton could be birth mother to actor Ezra Miller, but there is no father and son resemblance. I remember Tilda in Edward II (1991) because my old friend from drama school Steven Waddington played Edward.  Stevie was one of the nicest people I remember at drama school.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton carries this difficult story which is from a mother's perspective. She was brilliant in the 2008 film `Julia'. In this production she gives her best on screen performance and I hope she's proud of it. I love the fact she doesn't do interviews and is removed from the frenzy of gossip media. And I love the fact she doesn't do too much television. If she did TV, she would be a good suggestion for a character similar to Helen Mirren's DCI Jane Tennison. Tilda Swinton shames so many dull and restricted actors that we see repeatedly in film and Television. Her troubled son Kevin, played by Ezra Miller is an understated, excellent performance.<br /><br />So much of this film focuses on Tilda's face, her expressions, her feelings and reactions without any dialogue which is some achievement, not only down to Tilda but also to the Director Lynne Ramsey who certainly knows how to get the best out of her actors. I would have had Tilda's character in the flashbacks wearing more eye make up during happier times, so when we follow her during the present day there is more of a contrast as it's just her hair style that's different and her characters confidence. This film explores a mother and sons relationship, family guilt, self punishment, peoples need for someone to blame. All depressing stuff yes, but what a journey, especially if you don't know how this story rolls.<br /><br />Not reflecting any of the characters in WNTTAK, this film did ignite thoughts about parents from isolated communities alongside selfish trash introducing children into this world without love, care, guidance or simply being there when it matters. People like this are not fit for parental purpose and are responsible for the negative social consequences of their baby churning conveyor belts.<br /><br />The camera work and overall filming of this production is something else. Watching a good film from a director who doesn't have a huge body of work under her belt is so exciting.  Although I am a supporter that less can be more, the brutality in this film could have been slightly more hard hitting or visually challenging, without being too graphic. As it is - any violent acts are avoided which is fine, but the lack of a challenging visual impact can result in slight sympathy for the criminal, because you have not witnessed exactly what they have done. Alternatively, the film makers show you just enough for you to use your imagination. (Visual impact example: The camera just fixed closely on someone's face while they are committing a criminal act can be powerful).<br /><br />Heavy stuff indeed, and much better than I anticipated that's for sure. Make sure you watch this work, it's original, clever and will be talked about for a long time. I just love the scene when mother and son are in the restaurant.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|Directed by Rodrigo Cortes who has directed about seven short films prior to this one...and his next project is with Robert De Niro in `Red Lights. Well deserved.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds plays `Paul Conroy' a truck driver who wakes up in a wooden box. He has no idea why or how he got there...<br />the film rolls showing this characters unbearable experience in one single location. It is obviously suffocating, terrifying and extremely intense. Ryan Reynolds does a tremendous job in this emotionally charged desperate situation. This story is of nightmares, the films simplicity is one of awe. After seeing this at the cinema I bought the Blu-ray, it's a definite for my own collection.<br /><br />I was a little depressed afterwards, nothing to do with the film. I was just gutted that I didn't come up with this story. It's an actor's dream role and must have been an economical project to fund. I find it astonishing that no one else has created a story like this before, some films have come close though. Not one to watch if you have a heart condition because the tension is nauseating to say the least. `Buried' has won several awards from four different film award organizations. I'm sure some people might not appreciate this film or they don't want to watch it knowing the concept. It's intelligent, well scripted and edited. Everyone involved in this production should be very proud. An all round unique thrilling experience that will stay with you...<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.com

B006QKJZMW|3.0|The idea of human trafficking existing for the pleasure of the silent rich to torture is both believable and disturbing on many levels. It touches the nightmare of captivity and the absence of humanity, just pure evil for one's sick private world. Apparently Eli Roth who wrote and directed the first two Hostel films got the original idea when he came across an article that suggested destitute families in Thailand would sell family members to well financed criminals and in turn businessmen from Europe and the US would pay $10,000 to walk in a room and shoot the sold individuals in the head. Shocking and very upsetting.<br /><br />`Taken' (2008) gave us the action and the probability of how huge the human trafficking trade is in the world while the Hostel films just trims the fat off to give you the meat of unbearable acts one human can do to another who's strapped to a chair. Watching these films you can actually imagine the very real possibility of yourself being suddenly taken away and no one will know where you are and you can't escape. That is why this horror franchise stands above other lame film imitations. You will notice the influence of the brilliant `Hangover' films in this third instalment, it's almost a bloody carbon copy horror version of `The Hangover' (2009). The opening scene is great and unexpected, the ending could have been awesome. Unfortunately the makers decided to have a predicable comedy ending, just like so many other horror films do because they are fearful of taking risks. Giving the audience what they want instead of what they don't expect. I hate safe.<br /><br />Putting aside the awful ending I enjoyed this episode, Eli Roth was not involved so I was interested to see how this one would pan out. I love the concept of the `Elite Hunting Club' whereby members have the round bloodhound tattoo. For this film franchise it's a great private members club title with a consistent brand tattoo design. The Vegas environment here is a nice glitzy touch which is a visual contrast for when a lad's stag experience goes horribly wrong.<br /><br />The way the torture chambers are presented in this feature is the best in the trilogy. However, the actual torturing moments lacked the horrific impact of the first two. The first torture scene I found rather unbelievable, but hey, then again what do I know. I'm not in the medical profession nor am I a sicko psycho surgeon. So the nastiness is toned down here and it could have been really uncomfortable and imaginative if the right creative team was on board. Hostel III is gentle brutality compared to the other two but it did hold my attention. To bring the franchise way ahead of acceptable same old same old horror, if they make a fourth episode, whoever produces and directs need to create an experience that will be traumatic, unexpected and compelling. Or else it's best to leave the blu-ray box set as a trilogy.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comuch which is a visual contrast for when a lad's stag experience goes horribly wrong.<br /><br />The way the torture chambers are presented in this feature is the best in the trilogy.

0345803485|5.0|I love this book. The only other books I have read that have even came close to this was when I was seventeen and I read one of my mom's romance novels. This is NOT the same. I literally COULD NOT put this book down!!! I have two and three coming in tomorrow *fingers crossed* and I am as giddy as a little girl waiting to wear a new dress. I have read Fifty shades twice in less than a week waiting on 2. I am in awe of Christian and I find myself looking up characters to play him in a movie if there were to be one. And Ana, precious, unknowing Ana, she takes on the role of \\"in love but I cant tell him\\" very well!! I love that she is suppose to be his sub but, she is afraid to let go over herself and her independance to be that for him.<br /><br />I would def say that this is a must read for many moms and wives out there. It has actually spiced up my own personal sex life- I love that and so does my husband!!.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fun game to a point.  Too glitchy though.  Game would often lock up and crash my Kindle.  Then when I resume the game all my tasks had ungodly wait times like 100+ hours.  It did this several times so I uninstalled it.

B0061S0A64|5.0|Only reason for writing review is to perhaps counter some of the negative reviews.<br />I almost did not buy because of them. ( actually it was free!!! )<br />Having said that, this is an extremely melodious application.<br />It reminds me of the sounds of wind chimes on a gentle breezy day.<br />I have downloaded about an app a day since the Kindle roll out.<br />I have deleted almost 90% of them from the \\"cloud\\" as I do not like clutter.<br />I will keep this one.<br />I have no idea why it got bad reviews except perhaps from a competing app writer.<br />Check my reviews on amazon.  I have a fairly good review rate.<br />This is a cool app if you enjoy harmony that is fool proof.<br />I look forward to messing around with it.<br />Thanks for the reset to default tabs..<br /><br />CHeers<br /><br />ps.<br />Make some mods and start charging for it.  They would make nice ring tones
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have had no trouble with the SuperTooth Buddy so far. I've had it for about a week. No one seems to be able to tell I'm driving when using it. It was a single button push to pair it to my phone (EVO). Very easy to use and seems to be a good quality.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|I've been a fan of Il Divo for many years, and their latest album Wicked Game doesn't disappoint. Their classical spin on today's favorites is always sensitive and well put together. My favorite track is the second one, Llorando. Most of it is a capella, which to my knowledge doesn't occur on any other album of theirs and literally took my breath away. The sound mixing could use a little improvement because their blend isn't as good as it is on the first album, but other than that it's fantastic.
B000IAZ5HK|3.0|I hemmed and hawed over the idea of spending $35+ on a dressing shaker.  I compared all of the other options on amazon (there's a couple), looked in the limited shopping areas in my town (none really), and kept coming back to this one.  So after having it sitting in my cart for two weeks decided, what the hell... why not?  So I bought it and I'm very happy.  I deducted one star because of the cost - I think it should be closer to $25.  It's a little smaller than I anticipated but I've been used to making single servinges of dressing every day so it's nice to have a container to make a few days worth (we go through a LOT of balsamic vinnaigrette in my house) and the fact that it's glass makes it easier to clean than the plastic rubbermaid things I've been using as dressing shakers.  Lastly, it's hard to see in the pictures but after you poor, theres a secondary metal tube around the pour spout that catches any \\"drippage\\" that would normally happen.  No mess, no wasted dressing!  Makes me happy to continue buying my expensive EVOO and fancy vinegars.<br /><br />**Update: So, the shaker was great while it lasted.  I thought the glass wasn't as fragile as it turned out to be.  It was knocked over onto the floor and showed no sign of cracking. Until grandma was doing dishes and sliced her finger open.  Sad. Bought a cheap plastic shaker. Use with care. Bumped down one star for durability.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I think this is amazing!  It's absolutely worth 1.99.......but oh.....that's right, it's FREE today!  Whomever thinks it's boring or useless, I mean no disrespect.  You're certainly entitled to your opinion......just uninstall it!  This is brilliant!  I can only imagine what went into creating this.  I certainly could not have done it!  So I say &quot;bravo devs!&quot;  Great job!  This is very well done and you should be proud!  This is AWESOME.....and well worth 1.99......but it's free today, so thanks!
1594481938|3.0|I started out really enjoying the book.  I was laughing out loud.  But then as the plot progressed, it really flatlined.  I did finish the book, although I had to push myself.  I kept waiting for something more to happen, but it didn't.  I felt like the book just sort of ended.  I thought there would be something greater than that.  Was a bit disappointing.  This was my first book by this author and I'd still try another of his books before writing him off completely :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story is interesting but the writing is terrible. I found myself reading the book in short spurts - I'd finish 10 pages or so and be unable to continue because the writing was just so bad. Then after a day or two I'd go back to the book out of curiosity for what happens next and finish another 10 pages. 4 stars for the story line, 2 stars for the writing.
1439102732|5.0|Once again, Jodi has written about a controversial subject with sensitivity  and caring. The research for this book is phenomenal. Jodi continues to write on subjects that broaden our knowledge and expand our thinking. I love the way she develops the characters in each book, brings in several story lines and then somehow brings it all together in the end.

B0000024RQ|5.0|So what is The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan? On the tip of the iceberg, it's good folk music - really good folk music in fact. It's got good guitar playing, and Dylan's famous vocals and harmonicas. With these primitive tools Dylan manages to create a satisfying musical experience.<br /><br />However, the core of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the lyrics. The politically and socially piercing lyrics. Bob Dylan  criticizes the corrupt politicians, the corrupt society he lives in, the corrupt environment he was raised in. For example, Dylan criticizes our ignorance of the problems of society in Blowin' in the Wind.<br />\\"Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows<br />That too many people have died?\\"<br /><br />Politicians being cowards while ordering men to die in stupid wars:<br />\\"You play with my world<br />Like it's your little toy<br />You put a gun in my hand<br />And you hide from my eyes<br />And you turn and run farther<br />When the fast bullets fly.\\"<br />Etc.<br /><br />There are a lot of criticisms in The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and these are just a few examples. If you are not fond of these criticisms or do not care, the album does not fail to deliver since the music is awesome anyway.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I would give this application 0 stars if that were possible.  It came with my Sprint phone and presumably Amazon paid Sprint so that customers couldn't remove the application.<br /><br />That's fine, I just never used it.  I never bought anything, I never browsed anything, I never even opened the application.<br /><br />Of course, that didn't stop this worthless excuse for a piece of software from downloading random updates whenever the hell it wanted; like when I was trying to do other things with the phone.  It also had a fun little feature (re: bug) where it would use 100% of the phone's processor for minutes on end.  I say minutes because it would often run down the battery life on my phone.  I would, randomly throughout the week, find that my phone had turned itself off due to low battery power.<br /><br />Again, mind you, I had never opened or used the application.<br /><br />I endured all of this with quiet patience because while it was definitely an inconvenience, I was busy and it wasn't *that* big of an inconvenience.<br /><br />Then then time came when I was driving and tragically, a car in front of me struck a pedestrian.  I pulled my car over in the road to block traffic from become a danger to the injured kid who was lying in the road with a compound fracture in his right leg (it looked like his leg had nearly come off), scrapes, contusions, broken teeth, and most likely a nasty concussion.  The people driving the car that had struck the person got out and started freaking out.  They stood around looking panic'd without a sense of direction.  I got out of my car and dialed 911, spotted a street address posted on a nearby building, and ran over to the kid to see how bad it was.<br /><br />Meanwhile, my phone stalled and I waited, and waited, and waited.  For 2 minutes and 14 seconds I waited for my phone to call 911 while I slowly started to freak out thinking I wasn't going to be able to get help for this kid.<br /><br />In the end I did get through and managed to speak to 911 personnel, get advised on what to do for the kid, and made sure that the people freaking out didn't move him (neck injuries people, neck injuries).<br /><br />But for an extra 2 minutes and 14 seconds this poor kid had to lie in the street in pain saying \\"I just want to go home\\" over and over again.<br /><br />Later, after I got off the phone with emergency personnel, I looked in my phone's task monitor and histories to find out why it had taken so long to call.  As it turns there happened to be an application that I had never used that was, for reasons unknown, using 100% of the phone's processing power.<br /><br />Tell me, readers, which application do you suppose that was?  Go on, guess.<br /><br />Now some of you will say that I should have rooted my phone earlier to remove the app.  I know right?  Some people actually think that it should have been necessary for me to break my phone and change settings, voiding my warranty, so that I could call emergency services in a timely fashion.<br /><br />Amazon MP3 was forced on me.  I have never used Amazon MP3.  I WILL NEVER use Amazon MP3 after that.
030788743X|1.0|I went into this book with high expectations -- so many people loved it. When the narrator is actually adventuring, I confess I liked it. Watching him think through the puzzles and use his knowledge of pop culture to help him solve them grabbed my attention. And I have to admit I finished the book hungry to find some classic arcade emulators and a text-adventure or two.<br /><br />Too bad the good bits are few and far between. Instead, what we have are mostly reference after reference. The Delorean scene is perhaps the silliest one, but it only scratches the surface on how the author feels the need to list every game, movie, tv show, song, etc that he can think up. It loses its cool factor quickly.<br /><br />Worse than that are the ridiculous plot coincidences, the deus ex machina occurrences, and the all around lack of action. We are given a lot of information about the OASIS and the world outside of it. But that's all it is: Info dumping. Long speeches about this developer or that developer. Descriptions of the various planets. Off screen mentions of how Wade's avatar powers-up. I'll bet this book is only about 25% activity. The rest is just telling us another chunk of info.<br /><br />Also, Wade is a total jerk. He looks down on the other characters as being beneath him -- even when he's a level three. Fortunately, he's secretly the smartest hacker on the planet -- if only a series of coincidences will come along and earn him enough money and XP to prove it. I come back to my original opinion that it feels like fan fic. The author seems to be playing out a fantasy. Good for him. But his characters aren't very interesting, which makes it hard to root for them (esp Wade).  And the poor writing means that the emotional moments ring pretty hollow.<br /><br />I get it. I can appreciate the geek's need for minutiae. It can be an addiction. I am this book's target audience. I understand the personality traits and the obsession with current and past nerdy things. But aside from describing that personality type and giving us a slight glimpse into our near future, this book fails.ide from describing that personality type and giving us a slight glimpse into our near future, this book fails.
0375842209|4.0|\\"I admit it: If I were a literature teacher of the appropriate age group, this is exactly the book I would be forcing the students to read and study. And, heck, even enjoy. In a world where, in my opinion, the value of just what is good kidlit is falling, this book is a rejoicing of the beauty of great writing and great storytelling. In fact, I would have to say the incredible writing is my favorite aspect of this story.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Death, this is the tale of a girl being fostered in a little German city during WWII. Like the old-time books of decades ago, the story focuses on events and lives rather than a single plot. Leisel grows from girlhood to teenhood, experiences friendships and the looming horror of the war, and helps her foster family hide a Jewish man in the basement.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it takes a while for the story to really pick up pace. Indeed, save for the great writing, I found myself wondering for awhile just what this book was about. But I promise you, once the book gets going, it really does get going.<br /><br />It's a beautifully written book, thoughtful in its storytelling and theme, and well worth its attention.\\"

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I truly loved this utterly unique retelling of a futuristic Cinderella.  Cinderella as a cyborg!  I mean, how can you NOT love a book that starts out with that premise?  Cinder is a very likeable, appealing heroine and her story is completely gripping.  Even though anyone who knows the fairy tale (and who doesn't?) knows the general plot, I was still totally hooked, unable to put the book down.  The only thing I wished was that I had known going in that the book had a cliff-hanger ending, because I would have been better prepared to be left totally hanging without any kind of resolution to the story at all.  I confess that's not my favorite way to end a book!  But I still loved Cinder and will eagerly read the next installment.
B006L9B6TI|3.0|Very well done.  Not as inspiring though as the secret.  Always good though to be thankful.  This was a quick read, but seemed that it was a reach as a matter of writing another book.

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book should be required reading for everyone on the planet. She dispells fear of death and explained just why she had cancer. Her near death experience and miraculous healing shows just how we can heal from \\"terminal\\" illness by methods other than allopathic medicine. As a student and practitioner of Energy Medicine, I know that we can heal ourselves. (Yes, I have experienced a small miracle, too- anyone can, with proper training). And the first order of business is to live free of fear, as Anita explains. Enlightening and illuminating book that I had a hard time putting down.

B003UYUR10|3.0|Jake Gyllenhaal gets all hunky in this fantasy fairytale from the Disney people.  I was expecting less quite frankly.  With Jerry Bruckheimer producing however, we get an expansive CGI-laden adventure that is quite entertaining.  With a film like this, one must toss out realism obviously, yet we should expect a coherent story and good writing.  For the most part we get it.  Still the best thing here is Alfred Molina as a tax avoiding sheik hustling his way through ancient Persia.  He also has all the lines referencing today's society.  Throw in the drop-dead gorgeous Gemma Arterton and you have a nice piece of action fluff.<br /><br />The 1080p Blu ray transfer has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and is stunning from beginning to end.  Great colors and clarity.  I was expecting a good audio track and bingo it's here with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It is powerful and all encompassing.  Great disc.
0375758992|5.0|It would be impossible to talk about this book without<br />speaking of the author. She is such a talently writer that<br />she rivals Hemmingtonway or Faulkner.

B001C46P2K|4.0|The only picture in my mind of Queen Victoria is one of an aging dowager sitting for a photo, dressed in dark clothing.  Not attractive in any way.  As one of the actors says in an interview, old people were all young once, full of ideas, promise and energetic about it all. ..or something to that effect.  This film is a fine example of how to exploit all the British pomp and circumstance.  Great costumes, great music, wonderful acting and a terrific performance by Emily Blunt.  The downside is that the movie is PG so is somewhat restricted in some of the more gnarly material that could have been displayed.  I must have some British blood in me somewhere in the distant past, as I'm continually drawn to their history.<br /><br />Even if these wonderful costume dramas aren't your thing, you can't help but be impressed with this 1080p Blu ray transfer.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1.  The colors and sharpness of the disc is near perfect throughout.  The audio is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is equal to the visuals.  Not much in the way of subwoofer rumblings but that is the way it was meant to be.  A beautiful example of Blu ray.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Tho this isn't like the original (1960) which wasn't a comedy but for it's time a thriller (starring Jack Nicholson), this is one of the best remakes I've seen.<br /><br />Seymore and Audrey make this movie as well as the.<br /><br />This movie (as well as the 1960 version)  is so cute,  Seymore and Audrey really make the movie and keep it goin.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|picked it up... and couldn't put it down.  lol<br />would recommend to anyone who cant devote 100% but want something to pass the time.
0345803485|2.0|After all the hype I have to say that I'm very disappointed in this book. The writting left a lot to be desired...the whole book is silly really. Ana is always talking about the inner godess and subconcious and who they love and hate what she's doing and everything is his grey eyes....semi witty jokes, and one \\"spiraling\\" and or \\"earth shattering\\" orgasm after another. I didnt connect to these people at all and by the end of the book I wanted Ana to be real so that I could hunt her down and slap her for being stupid. I'll not be reading the rest of this trilogy
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play a lot of games like this I hav to say this one is the best I cant stop playing it!

B005HXGE9G|1.0|First off, I love Peter Gabriel and I love most of his solo and Genesis work.  I think over the years Peter Gabriel is trying to be more artsy just for the sake of being artsy.  He's trying way too hard.  I miss the good stuff like Red Rain and Steam.  Oh well.
B0010X745K|4.0|I read this story in a novel I believe was by Stephen King and I was transported into the story.  It was really good.  As most people say, the book is always better than the movie.  Having said that, this movie does an adequate job of conveying the book but with a different twist at the end.  The creatures are done as well as can be expected because nothing can match what you may see in your own mind.  I recommend this movie as a good must see.
B00064WSOQ|4.0|I'm a pretty big KC fan of all the versions of this band (my favorite will always be Starless and Bible Black) but as far as recent offerings go I really enjoyed this CD.  I wasn't too crazy about Construktion of Light but I found Power to Believe to be Fast, Furious and Fun.  I know there are many great fans that didn't enjoy this CD but I find that I can listen to the whole thing over and over and not get bored, unlike Construktion of Light.<br /><br />Pete
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played other card games and enjoyed them, but keep coming back to Spider.  Playing it is addictive and a fun way to chill.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Words can't describe how incredible this book is! This is easily the best book I've read so far this year, and I average about two books per week. Although this was originally a series of short stories, the Omnibus reads like one seamless storyline.<br /><br />I loved the character development in these stories. The people lead whole and fulfilling lives, experience an honest range of emotions (both good and bad,) closely guard secrets in their hearts, and constantly struggle for existence, to make sense of things, to achieve...despite living in a world comprised of only 140 floors.<br /><br />The world that Hugh Howey has constructed is so vast and rich, it's hard to remember that it's mainly set into the curved walls of a silo. All the systems required to have a functioning society; food production, IT, education, systems maintenance, rules on reproduction, and waste disposal, have been carefully planned out and accounted for. More importantly, the things that flesh out a society; taboos, religion, fears and hopes, the sound of children laughing are also painstakingly crafted by his words.<br /><br />The silo itself becomes a character. I love how Howey incorporates the stairs into the story. They become a test of will, a graceful arc of hope, or potential for despair. Not only is it the tie that connects the levels together, but it's also the gravity that keeps them apart. A barrier and a link. The very DNA of the silo's civilization.<br /><br />Just when you think this lovely combination of world-building AND character development couldn't get better, there's the writing. I especially liked how the artist masterfully weaved the metaphor of his title throughout the story. It was the element that could be crafted into a sweater that warms, but just as easily unraveled- like a lie. It's the truth being uncovered when the wool is pulled from one's eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I can't speak highly enough of this collection of short stories. At the end of the Kindle WoolOmnibus Edition (Wool #1-5) there is an interview with the author. He mentions that there will be more stories told in this world; I'm looking forward to reading all of them!
0061537969|3.0|I like books, all kinds of books- fiction and non-fiction.  I like to be educated and entertained- I expected more from this book based on the rating.  It was easy enough to finish(glad it was short)- It started out promising, I thought it would be very entertaining coming from a dog's point of view.. and at times, it was cute... but then it became very predictable, like a bad horror movie...  and the ending.. oh the ending.. just such a very boring, predictable ending.  I would have liked to have seen the dog come back and really be something...!!! ;)
B005HSL626|4.0|I love playing this game. It kills a lot of time and can get pretty addicting. My mom saw me playing this and she asked if she could play on my Android phone. The ads, however, are very very annoying. I guess this is what I get for getting a free version. I think they should at least make a little less ads or make them smaller because having them in the game only gives it four stars. If they take it out, I would give it 5 stars for sure.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever wasted time reading.  I don't get it...what is the appeal?  I found myself pissed off the entire time I was reading this book.  Pissed off because someone was wasting my time by writing such a ridiculous book, and somehow it got recommended by a friend of a friend.  How can this book be on the best seller list????I think I figured it out...the person who wrote this book....has a lot of friends and family, and there are a lot of us out here just looking for a good book.  They took advantage of us.  Because this is the most unappealing books I have ever read...Please....if you haven't read any of the books in the trilogy....please don't waste your time or money....find a real book!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|If you think this game is easy, you haven't given it a chance.  It gradually gets more difficult; more challenges get thrown in as you progress to different levels.  Some of them seem absolutely impossible, but don't give up!  The music is so soothing that you don't care how long or how many tries it takes you to complete a puzzle.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is up for a good  challenge.
B000JIHP88|2.0|This mobile is adorable, colorful and engaging. Unfortunately, it did not fit our \\"Emily\\" crib so had to return.  Major bummer, it's the only mobile we really liked.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!!!  need I say anymore?  XD  Grrrrreat game definatly download. Its fee how can you go wrong?  all the games are really fun. :)
0345803485|5.0|I had pretty high expectations of this book when I ordered it and let me tell you....it lived up to every one and more! I could not put this book down once I started. Yes, the sexual tension between the two is enough to draw you in, but I definitely connected to Anastasia's character. I couldn't get enough of this growing love between the two and how both characters take a leap of faith to somehow try to please the other to make this work. I have never read a book like this before and cannot wait to start the second book!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What really makes this collection worth while are all of the extras.  There are some scenes from A New Hope that I really wish had made it into final production.  If you can get this on sale, do it!
0439023521|5.0|I've never met anyone who didn't enjoy this book. It is a very fast read and, I couldn't put it down. I read the book right before the movie came out, and I have to say that I enjoyed the book much more than the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if you love farm town or farmville you are sure to love this game where you do all kinds of quests to help set up your new town in Oregon
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Really wanted to try this. Love the movies. Won't even open. Says checking for updates and then says I'm not connected to Internet. But I am.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Is there a way to delete the nodes? if not that would be the thing that would make this app a killer. Also it force closes on the veiw sonic veiwpad. These are the only things keeping me from giving this app the five stars it deserves.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can have my notes everywhere! Its great on my computer,  ipod,  kindle fire. Amazing app thank you.<br />syncing is also seemless. the only thing is that I wish I could change the Colorado of text lime on the Pc version, this goes for the ipod app too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fun fun fun book that kept me wanting more! Loved it! I read all three of the books in 2 weeks and didn't want them to end. Although these books are extremely graphic, not for the youngsters in my house!, I found them tasteful and gripping.
B00003CY0V|3.0|I didn't care about any of the characters except possibly the hacker/Hugh Jackman. I felt nothing for him at first but he got a bit more likable once he got involved with his daughter. He showed more acting talent than anybody else in this film. He also gets a bit more character development than anyone else in the film.<br /><br />John Travolta might be in this film but he didn't do any real acting at all. Halle Berry and Don Cheadle were only barely better.<br /><br />[*** spoiler alert! ***]<br /><br />The chase scene involving the beach and also with the cars later, those didn't get my interest, I've seen similar chases too many times in other films.<br /><br />The scene where the hacker simply pulls out some cable and the whole room completely goes dark, including all the computers, that scene did not feel believable at all.<br /><br />This is the part where I got confused the most. At the very end, when a huge yacht explodes, I'm lost. Who is responsible for that explosion? Jackman knows what really happened but only cares about his daughter. Both Travolta and Berry are on the yacht. Who intentionally blew up the yacht, if not the hacker and nobody is on their trail anymore? What did I miss here? The name of another terrorist is mentioned on the soundtrack, but not sure how that other terrorist ties in, unless there was a misunderstanding by somebody and the yacht is blown up because it is thought that terrorist is on the yacht?<br /><br />I looked at the two alternate endings. Unfortunately, they are not captioned or subtitled and I'm deaf, so I don't know what the dialogue is for the two alternate endings. It would have been nice if the alternative endings had been made accessible for deaf viewers as well.

B00005ASHM|3.0|Like many other \\"classics\\" from its era, Pet Sounds simply hasn't stood the test of time, not because its sounds weren't ground-breaking for when it came out, but because most of the songs really haven't aged well. \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" are absolute classics, but the best (and best known) of the remaining tracks, \\"Sloop John B\\", isn't even an original composition, and there's a reason that \\"Caroline No\\" is probably the only remaining track that non-owners of the album will have ever heard. This album is far more important for the influence it would have on The Beatles as a studio band than as a musical statement by Brian Wilson: it's certainly not unpleasant to listen to, but the second-greatest album of all time, as recently selected by Rolling Stone Magazine? Absurd.
B00756GKBA|3.0|I bought her deluxe album and I must say, tracks 8 through 12 is really good! Disc 2 should of been on disc one. The rest are for TV shows, gay clubs and movies but they are NOT great tracks, they're okay. Next album needs to top this one M!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game was very entertaining. I play it in between all my other games. The down side is the energy problem but I kept it and I still play it. very cute
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing yet engaging... a wonderful break in a hectic day. Concept is great, music is great... A favorite of mine now...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I first read this book several months ago and didn't think much of it, but afer all the recent hype about it in the media these past few weeks, I decided to give it another try.  Here's what annoys me:<br />1)  Ana is 21 years old and has never had a boyfriend, kissed a guy or held a guys hand.  She is (naturally) described as beautiful and slim and men are very interested in her - this makes no sense to me.<br />2)  I can understand a woman being a virgin at 21, but when Christian 'deflowers her' she has not one but 2 orgasms...really?  come on!  Oh and with no prior experience manages to give him the bl*w job of his life.<br />3) Ana describes herself as too skinny, and never eats...refuses food, etc.  Is anorexia sexy?<br />4) Christian makes Ana not just cry, but sob at least 2 times before they are even actually dating.  What woman would get involved with someone who makes her cry so much.<br />5)  Christian is a psycho-stalker and abusive.<br />6)  There is nothing loving about a man who makes you cry and wants to control every aspect of your life, including interfering on your family time.<br />7)  The fact that it's supposed to be BDSM, but she refers to her 'vagine' as \\"down there\\" or \\"her sex\\".<br />8) If you got tired of how many times Stephanie Meyers used the word \\"chargrin\\", wait until you count the times E.L James uses the word \\"debase/debasement\\".<br /><br />Look, I can go on and on...part of me thinks that E.L. James is really a dude.<br /><br />This book is really depressing and makes me happy I'm single.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the only downside is you need &quot;energy&quot; to do stuff and you either have to wait or buy more but other than that its great fun
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|My nephews where playing until today - the point of their final frustration. First they complained about the unfair distribution of energy and cost of items. Then they went on to say the game is not giving full credits due for action items. The final farewell to this &quot;sucky game&quot; happened when they noticed their planted corn would be ready for harvest in 156 hours and it was stuck there.<br /><br />I noticed they created graves of the people that couldn't be saved with created objects. They even sell tombstones  in the store. I was caught off guard by the questions of death.<br /><br />Game has been deleted.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game it is very fun and concentrating.i hope you guys keep me with the updates and the news because this game is so interesting
B005ONTD42|5.0|I first spotted sphero in a magazine article praising it for its ease of use and ingenuity in product design. After receiving it and listening to the hype I am so glad it lives up to its expectations. For an idea so simple it has endless possibilities. So far I have only had a quick browse through the various options and whizzed it around the floor.<br /><br />Loving the boost button on the drivers app. Seems to send the ball into an overdrive, which is brilliant for quick driving. I have seen quite a few videos with things built around it an d this is exactly the sort of thing I am going to be using it for.<br /><br />I have been following the progress of the company for some time and have written a couple of articles about it on we site [...]<br /><br />As soon as I found out they were shipping internationnaly I had to buy one. A small issue if buying in the UK is that it comes with an american Plug so I had to buy an adapter before using it. But even this wasn't enough to knock it down a star!<br /><br />Buy it and you will be amazed at how much you can do with it!<br /><br />Happy rolling!
B005OMOKN2|5.0|Obviously this battery will work.  It's the same as the one that came with the camera. The real benefit here is the price.  Much cheaper than in photo equipment retailers. Delivered fast, too.

B005J3IEZQ|3.0|A comprehensive book outlining the life of a remarkable person. I am not sure that I would like to have met Steve Jobs, not sure that I would have liked him much. However he was in many ways brilliant and left a legacy to this world unsurpassed by any.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|difficult to have fun playing when you can only play for 2 minutes before running out of energy...unless you want to spend extra money to buy more.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really like this as much as quell. It has new and unexpected challenges to make me want to keep on playing.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I listened to the song samples and thought Stalingrad sounds average at best. Then I read all the 5 star reviews and I realized I should buy the CD... so glad I did.<br /><br />I was blown away after listening to the first minute of the first song. I love Stalingrad!!! All the songs are catchy, dynamic, melodic and definitely rockin. The singer sounds great. The songs are diverse with lots of differnet drum beats and tempos. The production is outstanding but most impressive to me are Wolf Hoffman's numerous guitar solos!!! Every song has a unique, melodic, entertaining guitar solo. There is so much great music to listen to on Stalingrad. Best Album I've bought this year.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|This is an excelent album, i love alot of the songs, she has done a great job putting this album together, its great there r a couple of songs that (are not appropreate for kids) however i love this album.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is such a light-hearted, hilarious Christmas movie. This movie gets watched several times throughout the holiday season every year. It's one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a fantastic book series, and the adaptation to the tv series is remarkable considering the sheer volume of the books.  Visually, the series is breath-taking; the music is beautiful and powerful; the acting is top-notch.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|Erotica, is one Madonnas best c.d.s It was during a time when Madonna, was trying to push boundries, and be sexual.<br /><br />  The first single was 'Deeper and Deeper'. It to me was a classic. Also the song 'Rain' is also a classic.<br />  The song 'Bad girl', is a simple, but catchie song, Other songs that are good are Waiting, Why is it so hard?, and the remake of Fever.<br />  The song, 'In this life', a song that madonna made about a couple friends, who died of aids, is sad but absoulutely beautiful.<br />  The song 'Thief of hearts', is so funny. It is one of my favorite songs.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|With 6 months of use with this case, I can say this works without a doubt.<br />I must have dropped my phone over 10 times from light drops to near phone killing speeds. Each time, the phone was undamaged and not a single dent on the chassis.<br />This works like a charm, but the only negative part is that this is for the international edition and the US ATT version, which is my bad.<br />But nothing a little cut won't fix as the only part that did'nt fit, is the top microphone near the headphone port.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loving the simplicity.  Even our five year old can play. . . but doesn't care about high scores yet. I like the soothing background  music.<br />Theme is very pretty.
B004EPZ00M|5.0|When we realized that Johnny English Reborn hadn't been released for the holidays (2011). We purchased the original Johnny English to view with family .  We are hooked!  Johnny English Reborn will be viewed as many multiple times as the original for sure!  So much is this a family favorite that we are sharing it with our kids friends and gifting these often! \\"Reborn\\" has a bit more adult dialog than the first.Its family friendly for kids 11 and older for that reason.  Though it may fly over the heads of younger kids, as  mom I felt that the content is better for older kids.  Both the original and \\"Reborn\\" do not disappoint with many.  Great fun for the whole family.  Many laugh out loud scenes and unexpected turns to keep you wanting more!!
B0061S0A64|3.0|I love the fake reviews, btw, we see right through these.<br /><br />the app is interesting, lots of theses types out there already.  this is over 20 words!
0446573019|2.0|I think I've read all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, and enjoyed them all.<br /><br />This story was like reading another Reacher novel, only not quite as well written. Reacher is a legend that might be copied but not outdone.<br /><br />Shame on Baldacci, he can do better.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|We just watched this last night on Amazon streaming and I was so disappointed. Had Meryl not done such a phenomenal acting job I would have given this 0-1 stars. I expected this movie would bash Margaret Thatcher because she was head of the Conservative Party but this went beyond that. It was bizzare and almost Felliniesk with the whole movie revolving around her implied dementia and halucinations of her long dead husband. It never stopped.<br />  Here we have a movie about one of the strongest women of modern times rising up through an all boys club and becoming the longest reigning PM of Britian and all it want to show is her declining years in a delerium!?!?!? What is going on? I would have loved to have known how her career came about, who helped what brought her to her convictions, her relationship with Reagan. I could go on but what's the point. It was horrible and I cannot recommend this movie, despite the outstanding performance of Myrel Streep.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Better than Mario. Because it 's Lep 's World. He seems to be a happy little leprechaun. Not a mean,  nasty,  greedy. lit'l KILLA.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Interesting concept. for those who have tried fruit loops, this is a like a version of fruit loops in outer space.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Pros: Very nice CPU I strongly recommend it if your in need of a budget gaming CPU like me. Plays very well with my hd 6870, getting 38-60fps(vsync) on BF3 ultra 2x 16aa on large map 60+ players, runs dirt3 8x 16aa ultra 55-60fps(vsync), both games played at 1360x768 Resolution on my 32inch TV(native res).<br /><br />Cons: Be sure to get an aftermarket fan cooler when you order this, stock cooler is very noisy and doesn't keep it super cool(it doesn't overheat but still it's noise gets to you). I got a CM hyper n520 cooler and stays around 35c on idle and low 60's on full load.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the series.  Can't wait for the new season to begin (I'm assuming there will be a new season).  I was thoroughly caught up in the story line and enjoyed it immensely.  The acting and story line was very, very good.
B0011UGLK6|4.0|It would not download onto my Kindle.  Therefore, I had the great pleasure of reading the actual book!  Jumpa Lahiri is a masterful writer whose work is always a joy to read.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|The character development is flawless, and you don't have to think too hard to realize how tragic this story is. Wonderful voice acting, good animation for when it counts the most ie: dramatic confrontations and fight scenes. Even the music was mood setting being dark, mysterious, and dramatic all at once, it was a great addition to any scene. I never for a second doubted the characters beliefs, reasons, actions, feelings, or realities because even with such a complicated twist in character; it makes sense. If you don't know what happens because you didn't read the comic, I suspect you're in for a surprise. If you know what's going to happen? You'll enjoy seeing the mystery unfold with the action and dramatic confrontation.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|i was really looking forward to reading the hunger games books because i keep hearing how good they are,well i tried to download this book on my kindle and it wouldnt,it would only download what the chapters were but none of the literature was there,so i returned it,i called kindle support hoping to solve this issue,i tried to download it again,it would only show the book for a second but then when i went back to my home page on the kindle and tried to get back into the book again and i was having the same problem as the first time,the chapters where there but none of the story was...so once again i returned it,tried to download it again later,it still wouldnt work,so i bought 4 other different books by different authors and it downloaded just fine,so i dont know if there is just something wrong with the downloading process of that particular book or what but i wont be trying to buy it again anytime soon until they fix this problem...im sure this book is a great read,i was just having problems downloading it=-(
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|level 17 and everything keeps resetting.. animals, crops and buildings. also if i have already achieved something they have set up as a task i dont get credit for it i have to sell it and do it again
0439023513|2.0|I can't believe the Suzanne Collins dropped the ball on this book. Very disappointed with the very RUSHED ending and omission of details. From the first book to the second, she created a large romantic tension between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. By the end of \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mockingjay\\", it was all gone. Suzanne Collins suddenly wants to turn the audience that the importance is no longer Katniss' feelings, but on the war itself. And ONLY the war. She created so much tragedy of her deceased friends/family that her attempt to bring back the romance between Katniss and Peeta was pretty much... A pathetic attempt to remind the viewers that she did indeed Love Peeta. You don't feel the tension of romance anymore. Grief is the only thing the reader can feel by the end.<br /><br />Overall... Very disappointed. Suzzane Collins had the idea well placed... and dropped the ball at the end zone... =(
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I had already downloaded this app but it said I have to download it again.I like it because. it's a nice app.

0811877485|2.0|These were hard to smooth out, as they come folded and the creases were still evident in some of them after I put them up. Also, they only lasted a week before they started peeling off and needing to be re-stuck up every few days. I have had them for six months now and have ended up throwing half of them away because they no longer stick. These shouldn't be called decals, they are just stickers.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game! I just wish that the energy wouldn't run out as quickly as it does. Easy to play and reminds me of Oregon trail from back in the day.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I heard Hurt in the Colombiana closing scene and credits.  It is hauntingly beautiful.  I used SoundHound to id it and and went to buy it.  Amazon has this album for $34.99 and Google Music has it for $9.99.  I'm buying it from google.  Wow!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins channels her inner Jonathan Swift in this latest Epic Everybody Is Talking About. With its grisly last teen standing plot line, its unlikeable (if only at first) character, its dystopian world in which bored, cowed residents of a future successor state to America watch eagerly on TV as 24 kids slaughter each other, you may dislike its premise, but you'll probably keep reading anyway.<br /><br />Since the story's told in first person present (with no framing devices like, say, \\"a manuscript found in the ruins written 90 years ago by...\\") you know butt-kicking Katniss is going to be around on the last page, so the suspense involves reading on to see how she'll arrive there.<br /><br />There are some great scenes along the way: before the games start Katniss and the other contestants are paraded about in costumes. Katniss's bursts into flame (don't worry). She comes from poverty-ridden coal-mining \\"District 12,\\" and she's never seen a fancy shower like the one in her hotel, and she doesn't know how to operate the controls. And then there's the pregames interview which sort of sets the scene for everything that happens after.<br /><br />And when the games do begin Ms. Collins proves she's a master at creating tension, and she gives your emotions a workout too. There's one character especially who you'll probably quickly realize you'll too soon be saying good bye to. You'll keep hoping that won't happen, but it does of course; and when it the scene comes, it'll leave you drained.<br /><br />But reader beware: Unlike those previous Epics Everybody Was Talking About there are no warm life lessons offered up by wise, caring sorcerers (yes, Katniss does grow, but she pretty much does it without much outside help), no fuzzy types running about barefoot, no magic rings, no mythical kings, no supernatural blood-drinkers. On the contrary there's just this half-ruined world filled with that bored, cowed populace enjoying something we've all (if we can only admit it) fantasize about: A game show where contestants pay the supreme penalty.t) fantasize about: A game show where contestants pay the supreme penalty.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app use it daily love how I can read on my phone kindle and get emailed my plan so I am never too far from His word
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awsome!  i enjoyed this game very much! i also like the fact that it is free, so i can play without paying.
0307346617|5.0|As a big history buff and fan of alternate history I really enjoyed the way this story was told from st standpoint of an oral history. While a little shoppy as far as a coherent story, it was captivating and made for a great read and made the whole idea of a 'zombie apocolypse' quite real if you buy into the story. All in all highly recomended.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!!! its good for anyone!! very cute animations and very funny!! I think anyone who will get this game will loooove it!!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I reallt love the app for the Kindle Fire, but can you download from the internet? I am just curious.
B004SBX112|3.0|I downloaded this game because I heard it was really fun but it was actually fairly boring. There was not enough action and the first level was easy. The rest I found to be very hard and I finally un-installed it. This app might be very good for people who hate reflex based games or for people with a love for physics.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Insight into a different life style. Wonder what I would do if I was put into that situation. All the glamour is enticing. Can't wait to read the second book.
B0061S0A64|4.0|This app is refreshingly nice. It is an unique way to create electronic music on Kindle fire. It works perfectly both in landscape mode or Portrait mode. The beauty of this app is to create endless variety of music without knowing any rules in music. You pretty much can move the nodes around by touching the screen and make beautiful soothing melodies. Love it.<br /><br />If you are a musician you probably will know which tunes and tempo to select to make perfect sounding melody. Love the echo feature. Makes any tone sound great. It also has an option to record your own creation in WAV format and listen to it later! - very cool.<br /><br />Thanks for making this app free for today. It is surely a worthy download.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|It's really rather simple devise that allows you to connect a microphone or camera to your Ipod or Ipad. Worth the investment if you need the additional capability.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a pretty good game. it tries to make you spend some cash but what game doesnt. i cant wait till a get a reward for this review and peace out everyone
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was so excited by the chance to have a game based on a film and characters that my grand children love.  But when I tried it out, as I do all the games or books I down load for them, I was very disappointed because there is no way to turn this game off -- no way to pause it, no way to go to another app.  I finally gave up and removed it from my kindle fire.  How can this be called Ice Age Village (Kindle Fire Edition) if it doesn't work on a Kindle Fire?
B00466HN6S|4.0|This movie is great for children and adults alike.  My 5 year old grandson watches it over and over...He loves the music and all of the vibrant color.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I tried to like this record. Really.<br /><br />But it fails, utterly. I listen to a lot of weird ambient stuff sometimes, when I am bored with prog and metal.

And I'm not following.<br /><br />NEXT!!
B000050HTO|4.0|At two discs and 30 songs, The Essential Bob Dylan is about as basic a primer to America's Greatest Living Songwriter. Thing is, as O write this, it is 50 years ago this week that \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" was first released, and that means your 30 songs doesn't even merit a song per year. Dylan-Philes would not be satisfied with that few songs, but then Dylan-Phobes might get a better notice of what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Despite the mythic mumble mouth of legend, Dylan has a killer knack for melodies, which is why some of his songs have made surprisingly odd cover versions. \\"If Not For You\\" was an early hit for Olivia Newton John, \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" helped define The Byrds, and Rod Stewart did a heck of a version of \\"Forever Young.\\" There's even the covers that outshine Dylan's own, like \\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" and Jimi Hendrix' definitive version of \\"All Along The Watchtower.\\" After all the years, the songs of Bob Dylan can still hold relevance, as \\"The Times They Are a Changing\\" making an appearance in the movie \\"Watchmen\\" opening credits.<br /><br />All of Dylan's periods are represented, including the Christian moment and his latter day resurgence (\\"Jokerman,\\" \\"Everything is Broken\\"). What is amazing is just how consistent Dylan is. No covers albums, no attempts at lounging it, no albums of \\"revised\\" materials (live albums discounted). There are far two many songs omitted to make this perfect, but this Essential is perfect for a casual music fan.
1450419895|5.0|Great workout manual for serious weightlifters and gym rats. Frederic Delavier is a gifted illustrator. Many have tried to mimic his work, but few come close to matching it. The detail on these illustrations is fantastic and really helps hammer home what's going on with these exercises.

Delavier has teamed up with co-author Michael Gundill on a couple of other titles as well, [[ASIN:1450400957 Strength Training Anatomy Workout, The]] (a likeminded workout book intended for those building muscle at home or on the road with limited space and minimal equipment - dumbbells, body weight, bands, etc.), [[ASIN:1450413994 Delavier's Core Training Anatomy]], and [[ASIN:1450413986 Delavier's Stretching Anatomy]]. Delavier's STA, Core Training Anatomy, and this book will all speak to hardcore lifters serious about building muscle. Highly recommended!

B0061S0A64|5.0|realy fun ..I started playing this game and it was hard to put down . ive been playing it all morning
B0052VUNHC|5.0|As the title and summary says this book is about a dysfunctional relationship, so no surprise there.  It is written beautifully and believable. I work in college/High School and some of the characters remind me of my students.<br /><br />I picked the book up because of the amount of reviews it had, is not a book a would typically buy, so I was surprised to find that I loved the book. Since finishing it, I proceeded to buy two other books from the author.  I will be re reading this book, is a keeper for sure.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just can't put it down! need to keep building and buying! so fun and addicting! wish I had more time to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|containes many fun and entertainkng games that keeps you busy while having fun and is appropriate for all ages. recommended for everyone and its free.
B0033RT7RY|5.0|The story of this movie tells us that the Bible is translated incorrectly and that A Man who was honest wrote  the old bible how Jesus spoke his disciples and his people..Man died and she receives a gift from her mother from Brazil his crown with a cross..A Man such as he was very good, but during his life never had the stigmata..He entered into her body and correspondence truth ..Then she received the Stigmata .. Movie is very good and I like it a lot .. I recommend this movie to everyone ..
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is certainly not literature. However, it is very good!<br />At first, I had doubts about the overly sexual theme but it certainly doesn't diminish or overshadows the romance and love story. It is Twilight for adults. If you enjoyed that trilogy (as I did) you will definitely enjoy this one.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed all three books and recommended to my friends.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Just like every other terrible facebook builder type &quot;game&quot; trying to get impatient people to buy in game currency............with the added bonus of the kindle fire having to be force shutdown as the only way to quit.<br /><br />Do not install on Kindle Fire!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This movie really came out of nowhere and really surprised me with how good it was. It had great characters in it and a very unique plot that was executed perfectly. the special effects were also very impressive for a movie with only a 12 million dollar budget! you must see this movie!!!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Katniss is a young woman of 16 living in a place called District 12 where all residents must work in coal mines for existence.  Residents in the capital city of the country benefit from what is produced by the districts but don't allow the people in the other districts to prosper.  Every year, the districts must provide a young girl and boy to participate in The Hunger Games, a game in which only 1 participant can survive.  The games serve as a display of the strength of the capital city over the districts and keeps them in line.  The surviving winner is given many benefits so each district hopes to have the winner which gives them hope and distracts them from revolting.  Katniss, whose survival skills are evident before she begins the games, appears a shoo in winner but another member of her district in the Hunger Games brings in a new complication, love and affection.  Districts begin to revolt after watching the game and the three books cover the games and the revolts.  The story was Ok in my opinion, better in the 1st book and weaker in the 2nd and 3rd books.
0345472322|4.0|This book made me realize how I look and decide on things. When it comes to my personal life I am able to make important life decisions, but have tremendous difficult dealing with failures. I had a fixed mindset. Yet, when it comes to working, I accept my mistakes and take them as a learning opportunity to become better at my job. I have a growth mindset. I never realized it until I read the book why a I would allow little things which can happen to everyone in my personal had such a detrimental affect on how I felt. I would refused to forgive myself, despite the fact I had friends and family supporting me and telling me to see it differently. Now I have been enlightened and realize I should try to think of everything in a growth mindset. I strongly recommend this book to anyone. Especially for those that have difficulty accepting and learning from their mistakes. I have learned to put the same effort in my personal as I do in my professional life.<br />I thank the author for sharing her expertise.
0439023513|3.0|This is the third book in Suzanne Collins' trilogy of The Hunger Games.  I found this book much harder to follow and keep interest in the story.  The war with the capital continues and many people have been killed.  Gale and Peta are still around.  What will happen?  I won't publish any spoilers but I didn't find this third of the story all that surprising or exciting to read.  I did want to know who she ended up with and was satisfied that way.
B0061S0A64|5.0|You could waste some serious time playing this. This is an App I would have no problem buying if I did not find out about it on free app day.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thought that this was a unique twist to a magicians's duel.  At first I was a little confused by all the skipping around on dates but it all made sense in the end. The night circus is such a magical place and is described to such perfection that sometimes I think I am there. This is a book I'd read again and again.
B002L9PQGG|4.0|came quickly and works great. The most popular song sounds scratchy when played loud, so if you wanna blast it then go with the cd.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a cute game.  it is like Mario but its  free.  I like playing.  a lot easier than Mario too.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I have a two year old, this is wonderful app for both of us. There are other similar apps, but this is the best of them. Relaxing and fun. Best faotd in a long time!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|It was a very good production, and I enjoyed viewing it, I'll watch it many times in the future, it's very nice being able to view the entire production in the comfort of ones home.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love these workouts so much! For Prom this year I was borrowing a dress from a friend and it was super cute but its a size 6 and I normally wear a size 8... when I tried it on it was very tight! I really wanted to wear this dress so I started working out to 30 day shred again because it gave me such good results when I had used it before. Literally within a couple weeks, my stomach was flatter and after about 3 weeks, the dress fit comfortably! This was with only slight modifications in my diet as well. Jilian always says that these workouts replace hours at the gym and I've found that true...this workout brought results faster than any other workout I've done. I love that they are short and you can progress through the 3 levels. Level 3 is my favorite, so it's worth working up to! Buy this if you want to see changes in your body quickly!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I think that for $2.99 they would have made more levels available. for itunes the app is only $.99 and has another world not available on the aneroid market. why the huge difference in price for less app? I have always been a fan of angry birds but I really feel the creators simply got greedy.
B0042816YK|5.0|Brande new, great price, fast delivery.  And it takes me around the world to amazing places.  The movie leaves out some of the information from the book but I have enjoyed both.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I LOVE this book, its written in such a simple and beautiful way that you are just Sucked into enders life and you just don't want to come up for air, i read this book in about two days and will be happy to return to it at any time, i have recommended it to all my friends to.<br />Just read and enjoy:-)
0767830555|5.0|Brand new DVD, good price and arrived fast.  This is a classic movie that should be in every movie buffs collection.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really most say that i came to read this trilogy with not much expectation because there are so many books of this kind, but i was really blown away with the plot of the books and the way they are written, i couldn't put them down of my hands.<br />The only thing that bothered me was the third book that seemed a little to much like a si-fi/action like the sixth day, there was just to many scenes that sounded like they where taken from movies like that, and less the style of the two books before.<br />All and all great trilogy and most recommended.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Ah, Secretariat, what can you say?  The DVD was brand new and arrived quickly.  The story is timeless and a tremendous inspiration.
0439023513|2.0|As much as I LOVED the first 2 books, this one fell short for me. The only reason I kept turning the pages was in the hopes it would get better. It doesn't. Every likable quality of every character is stripped away. The book is nothing but depressing battles and deaths and mental breakdowns. I'm not saying that every book has a should have a happily ever after but this book flat out leaves you depressed and sorry you read it at all. Why waste time building up hope in the readers and making them love the characters only to end the story with \\"life sucks, and then it sucks more.\\" There was no victory over the Capital. The price was too high. And for whatever hope is to be left put in a few measly sentences at the end of the book was almost not even worth it. I go back and restate that I loved love loved the first 2 books... but this one is a REAL downer - no happy endings to be found here. There was an opportunity to do more with this.. there was opportunity to make Katniss the 'girl on fire' that she started out as being. Instead she was turned into a tv fictional superhero and became self-absorbed in self-pity. A far cry from the girl that volunteered to save her sisters life in the beginning. Booo. Hisss...
B003ELKNH2|5.0|Brand new and a great price.  Took a couple extra days to get it but I think that was our podunk post office.  This is an amazing story that can still make my hair stand on end.
0470876417|5.0|Excelent product! Ilusrations are very clear, it is simple, easy to read and it's a guide if you are looking for start a new business, and not just that, it's a completely new moethod to do it, and it contains topics that are easily forgotten.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|like the game. just don't like the fact that it takes so long to get your energy up. but all in all it is a fun game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game will keep you entertained for hours at a time.the little ones will like playing it too if they can get it away from the grown-ups in the family.get it if you can from the app store at amazon. they also have a host of other games to choose from and many are free just like this one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Yet another Â«Can't put it down bookÂ» A good read with a close under the microscope look at human society. The good and the bad of it all can be argued successfuly depending on your point of view at a given time during the books. I saw logic and method to a clear madness in the rules that did serve a purpose in keeping the sylo alive.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see just how many petri dishes manage to survive or are humans by nature doomed to fail by our own hand... More please...

B004J4WQ46|5.0|I was greatly privileged to have been born in the late 50s, schooled during the 60s and university student for the 70s & 80s. My parents played Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington, Stan Getz, Gilberto & Jobim etc. What a kickstart! But wait for it: the first LP my mom bought me was what I still regard as the Fab 4s best: 'A hard day's night'. I soon went on to The Rolling Stones, Hendrix...and rode the entire expanding galaxy of hippie high musical gorgeousness that blossomed and bloomed during the 70s. The zeitgeist had to tire - it was just too frenetic and deliriously exhausting. It seemed that everything that could be done had been accomplished by 1979. And then came New Wave. God bless The Talking Heads, B52s, The Police, Nina Hagen punk etc. And then came the degradation of the 90s. Not to mention the 2000s. With some notable exceptions e.g. Smashing Pumpkins, U2 keeping the pot boiling, everything seemed derivative. Derivative. Nothing seemed new. Singers resorted to screaming (Nirvana and worse), metal went to death, sounding as if straight from hell itself. Serious singers felt it cool to sound all frail and feeble (REM) - and out of tune (Red House Painters). But nothing really new. Only new levels of degradation or feebleness.<br /><br />So a while ago I am surfing through the Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Album of all Times & The 100 Greatest Albums of the 2000s. I agree with Kid A at the top of the latter but in 2nd place is a group I never heard of (don't forget I am generally so disillusioned with more or less anything post c1989). Off to the best local CD shop but can't find 'Is this it' - only 'Angles'. So I buy it and...Kapow! Jackpot! Struck the gold! I have finally found a rock and roll band that has influences yet is not derivative, that has a new and so excitingly different sound. A group of highly accomplished musicians. Their song writing is brilliant genius. The vocals are strong, effortless, expressive, strikingly accomplished, the voice of maestro Casblancas actually an additional instrument! I now have 'Is this it' and love it too - 4 star. Then I got 'First impressions of earth' - 5 star fosho. As with angles - 5 star. Fosho!!!<br /><br />Angles is so clever - the band plays around with various styles of rock music. And while indulging all this virtuoso exhibitionism they casually create a breathtaking masterpiece! How clever is that? Like Hendrix taking pop-song 'Wild thing' and creating a monument out of it at Monterey. I think the band's very own sound is best revealed on 'First impressions..'<br /><br />Now the important bit is this: I think that this band is so different, unusual, unique. This is a tall order for any rock band today, because the 60s and 70s are a hard act to follow - to put it mildly! But The Strokes have accomplished this damn near impossible feat. I sincerely believe that this band is up there with the shining gleaming stellar Stones! And I personally want to thank them for reviving my belief that someone out there could write kickass rock songs and deliver them like a blow to the head. Bravo Strokes, bravo! I am missing one album and can't wait for what is to follow! I'm you fan.voice of maestro Casblancas actually an additional instrument! I now have 'Is this it' and love it too - 4 star.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bared to You is one of those books that completely sucked me in, and consumed my thoughts.  I was finding ways to read this book whenever possible, when it wasn't convenient to whip my kindle out I was sneaking reads on my phone, via Kindle app.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has done a excellent job with the characters in this story, bringing them to life and making me love them.  The main characters in this story are the H/h Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel, along with Eva's best friend Cary.  All three of them I found to be multi-layered, and they all carry some heavy baggage which in turn effects the relationships that are formed.  I loved Cary, he seems to be a bit of a wild card with a story of his own. I hope we continue to know him more in the next book.<br /><br />Eva Trammel and her best friend Cary have just moved to New York,  a new city, a new job and a fresh start.  Before Eva can even get her feet firmly planted, her path crosses with the dark, sexy, and alluring Gideon Cross.  The instant attraction is completely overwhelming,  even though Eva tries to ignore it.  But it's hard to ignore a presence like Gideon.  From the moment he appears in the story, he exudes strength, dominance, and sex appeal. Gideon pursues Eva unrelentingly in  brash and possessive way.  Someone who's accustom to getting what he wants, he won't take no for an answer.  The attraction is too potent, and of course Eva submits to it. ( I would too! )<br /><br />Eva admittedly has self esteem issues, and it comes in to play a lot, but to her defense here, considering her past, and dealing with a man like Gideon and the situations she faces in regard to him I would totally feel the same way.  I really liked Eva, I didn't find her whiny or full of self pity.  She is challenging for Gideon, and as if I couldn't love Gideon more, he is so patient with her, and so giving of himself.  The truths of his past have yet to be uncovered, but the events of the story suggest something pretty dark lingers in the depths of his past. Not having formed any real emotional attachments before, the feelings he has for Eva brings out a sweetness about him that I just loved.<br /><br />What starts out as physical attraction quickly evolves in to something more.  Attraction, lust and falling in love are easy, but when the scars of their pasts threaten to come between them, staying together becomes the challenge.  I think their scars enable them to see beyond the damage and embrace each other in a way that someone who hasn't lived it could.<br /><br /> This is my first read by this author, and certainly won't be my last.  Bared to You is beautifully written.  Day kept me totally consumed by this story, and I found this book almost flawless.  I thought her descriptions were perfect in setting the scenes, and her characterization, and Sylvia Day knows her way around the smexy scenes  (Whew, *fans self*)  This book was all kinds of HOT!  I loved every single page!!the depths of his past.

B004UQPM4E|5.0|Superman the motion picture anthology is the most impressive bluray standard collection for comicbook fans as well as movie goers.<br /><br />Older generations will treasure this classical adaptation of a very much loved iconic character, played by the late star Christopher Reeves and the short-ended, Brandon Routh. Young kids will enjoy this version by its light-heavy in tone/campiness, until the next one arrives.<br /><br />High definition in the imagery is crystal clear from giving the colours of the soft palate more flare and the sound... in the other words - is beautiful.<br />Bluray contains interesting documentaries of the whole entire series from the production side - Movie goers and young filmmakers will learn how a film is constructed by financial standpoint to discussions and disagreements, showing their talents in blood, sweat and tears in the final products(Mainly the Richard Donners/Bryan Singers films).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this anthology as a journey through the eyes of the filmmakers. As a filmmaker in my own right - been through this process a number of times on smaller budgets (with high/medium coarse language).  It is a well-educational lesson at the same time, as being entertaining to watch.

0439023491|3.0|Overall I thought this was a good read. However, there are several problems that significantly hampered my enjoyment of the novel (though since it's a kids' novel, I may be judging it too harshly). Possible spoilers ahead.<br /><br />The farther I read in the book, the more I found Katniss' character to be just painfully naive. She seems oblivious to the many hints that there is a larger revolution brewing, for example the head gamemaker having the mockingjay on his watch, the incredibly obvious fact that the other tributes are colluding to protect her and peeta, etc. To me, these are so obvious, almost tropes. but Katniss consistently says thinsg like, \\"wow, I can't imagine why she would run into the fog just so me and Peeta could get away?\\" I couldn't tell whether this was a flaw in her character or just the author trying to pace the novel for younger people, who might not pick up on the hints as easily as a more seasoned reader. Nevertheless I consistently found myself groaning whenever she missed some obvious clue.<br /><br />As others have said, Katniss comes off as very selfish in this book. She has the opportunity to help everyone in the country fight back against the regime, but all she can think about is helping Peeta win the games (an obviously short-sighted solution to the problem). She tantalizingly hints at showing her contempt for the system (hanging crane, etc) but every time reverts to playing along with their games (dressing up in the coal costume for their amusement, etc).<br /><br />Also I found sending katniss and peeta back into the arena to be an incredible cop-out. Perhaps it's a shocking and suspense-laden plot development for the younger readers (who, granted, are this book's target audience), but to me it seemed not only cliche, but the worst kind of commercially driven decision. Reminds me of the endless strings of horror movie sequels that essentially just contrive some plot device to rehash the successful earlier installments (think \\"Saw\\", \\"Paranormal activity,\\" even \\"The Hangover\\"). I think Collins could have done some interesting things with it though, such as spending more time with Haymitch's backstory, or Cinna's. To me, haymitch is the most interesting, complicated character in the novel, and I think it would have really helped to know more of Cinna's motivations. Perhaps in the third book.<br /> Also the love triangle reeks of twilight emulation (and seems to have succeeded based on the swarms of what I'm assuming are teenage girls posting in the \\"Gale or Peeta\\" threads in the message boards here).<br /><br />I'll still read the third one, because it seems like the author is poised to finally cash out the revolutionary themes that she has tantalizingly hinted at for 2 novels, but my expectations are not that high.<br /><br />Take this review with a grain of salt: I realize this novel is aimed at young people. If you are a teenager or preteen who liked the first book, you will probably like this one. Or if you can keep that in mind while you read, and not sweat the cliches, you will also probably like it.<br /><br />I know my review seems harsh, but I actually did enjoy this for the most part. It's just easier to talk about the aspects that I didn't like than those I did.\\", \\"Paranormal activity,\\" even \\"The Hangover\\").

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app there are lots of games to play and the games that are on here are fun. Really fun!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun just like a Mario but it is free so that is really really cool this is not a rip of fifty percent original. I would say.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|...I agree with other reviewers that it takes FAR too long to rebuild your energy level.  Not everybody can afford to just buy energy points with real money!  Make it a little easier for those of us to play without having to sink money into it, and it would be a FIVE-STAR game for sure (or just charge a couple of bucks for the game, and call it that).

B007J4T2G8|1.0|RUN! Run FAR AWAY from this POORLY written book series!!!  The writing is poor (including grammar, spelling, run-on sentences, incomplete thoughts/sentences, and many similar references to a very familiar series). It is a fanfiction story turned into a published series (well-known to many... the author simply changed character names in order to put the book(s) on the market).  In addition, Christian is abusive. He beats women who look like his mother. He treats Anastasia like she is beneath him and thinks it's okay. Christian needs a psychiatrist to help him get over the abuse he suffered. It is Anastasia's first time. The way he treated her would have HURT her - this is wrong on so many levels. Christian found a venerable and insecure young lady and manipulated her into his twisted ideal relationship and idea of intimacy.  BDSM relationships need to have a whole lot of trust and FULL knowledge of what is to take place. Both parties need to have an understanding and be 110% certain it is what they want. This story does not have that. Anastasia can't talk about it with anyone other than Christian, so how is she supposed to know what is right? Why should she trust someone she just met? I wouldn't!!! She doesn't know him enough to know if he is truthful or if he is just filling her full of lies.

B005EI86JU|4.0|Was looking for guidance on how to use the various options that this camera offers. The book sounded good from the first few chapters sent to the Kindle for review. However, after purchasing the Kindle version and trying to use the information I found that although the book seems fine, the Kindle does not show the colors that are referenced and therefore makes the information difficult to follow and the Kindle does not show the full page (that also includes photos). I feel that they should warn the purchaser that this book is not geared to be used in Kindle version.<br />I am thinking about buying the book in the book form.

B005LAJ16I|3.0|The main problem with this show is that the characters are totally cheesy.  And the premise on which it's based is ridiculous and far-fetched.  Why is our main protagonist Brody, or Tom Walker for that matter, the way they are?  A dozen flashbacks will try to explain that to you - they are FAR from convincing.  Really, it's laughable almost what the scriptwriters expect us to swallow..  but apparently everyone thinks it's pure genius.  Beyond being unconvincing however, and a worse fault at that, is that many of the episodes actually drag, especially in the first good half of the season.  This is the kind of show that if you start watching, it's helpful to have something to do in the background until something semi-important happens in the story again as there's a lot of overlong scenes, syrupy music, more syrupy characters, and general padding that make this season, in its first half especially, a far cry from riveting.  Last but not least, the characters and dialogue often seemed kind of cheap and cheesy.  I wasn't much impressed with Damian Lewis.. his worst flaw wasn't that he was a turned terrorist, but that he was annoying to watch in almost every scene he was in.<br /><br />This show is total cheese.  I'd call it Swiss cheese cause it's so full of holes, but I'm afraid this grade A cheddar is American.  Or is it Kraft singles, the kind you get in the plastic in individual slices?  That's a good way to describe this show: overly processed cheap cheese for the masses, most of whom will mistake it for a quality product as evidenced by some of the 5-star reviews here.<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br /><br />The other possible reason the show gets good ratings is that the last episode is pretty intense proving once again that all's well that ends well.  Some of the last episodes more worthy lines include:<br /><br />Brody: \\"What if I had detonated that vest.. what would be different?  They'd have just replaced Waldon with someone else.\\"<br /><br />Nazeer: \\"Why kill a manwhen you can kill an idea?\\" He then instructs him to kill a man.<br /><br />Etc.<br /><br />I almost raised my evaluation for the series based on the season finale alone. But in spite of a strongish finale there were too many tepid episodes before it. Plus, and more importantly, there is the basic flaw of the screenplay which is that we're never given a seriously credible or convincing reason as to why U.S. Marine Brody would do this in the first place.  Because he saw the son of his tormentor killed in a bomb raid?  It just doesn't convince, and nor did any of the scenes that were supposed to provide basis for A) his love for Nazeer or B) his love for his son (he taught him English and they became close..).<br /><br />We're supposed to believe that the turning point for Brody was when Issa (Nazeer's son) and 80 other chldren were killed in a blast by U.S. military.  We're supposed to believe that he cared to avenge that evil to the point of giving up his own children/family/country and finally his own life.  I'm sorry, I don't buy it.<br />And what was it that turned Tom Walker, the buddy he supposedly killed?  Did he witness an American atrocity that made him turn as well?  Or was Nazeer just a good hypnotist?  That basic plot weakness made this whole show weaker than any 24 episode I ever saw.<br /><br />So enjoy the popcorn (with cheese), the thrills and chills, but please don't tell me this is a work of brilliance, cause it just ain't so!  It was interesting enough to finish the season.. and that's about the best I can say for it.
0545265355|5.0|Well, let me just say that these books got to me quicker than I thought they would, which I was very happy about :). The price was the best that I'd seen for all three being hardbacks! I am very happy with my order. And, if you're thinking about reading The Hunger Games trilogy, you should definitely order these...because once you read The Hunger Games you just have to read Catching Fire. I read all three in a week!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Warning: This App Is Addicting!  I love this app! So cute and really fun! I have no complaints. I did not have any trouble exiting on my Kindle Fire,all you have to do is hit options and the toolbar pops right up. I don't know why so many people claim to have trouble. Overall one of the best apps I have.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the first book. The second one is full of action and suspense, since anyone can be Katniss's ally or enemy. Didn't like the end so much but it was a good book to read.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Great film and extremely hot leading man.  Definitely worth watching for those with taste and any knowledge of silent film....and the dog is cute, too.
B002UHSDUK|4.0|Actually a good base selection of works from the FFs showing their roots and from where they stem.  The best part of this purchase is the free upload to Google Cloud. I actually didn't know much about the clouds for music, but it really helps the collection grow rapidly.
0345803485|1.0|This is a really bad book. Both main characters are stereotyped. The use of language makes the author seem to be uneducated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it!! it has so many versions to choose from and its easy to use. I use it all the time!
B007BT0RKG|4.0|It will be 5 stars if maps can be stored on external SD. Maps are rendered beautifully and fast, and with GPS enabled, you can see where you are on the map. Clean app, minimal buttons, and NO annoying Ads - thanks!!! OpenSourceMap have good detailed maps for US, but for some foreign countries like Asia, they are pretty minimal.
B000W9399S|3.0|bought this based on numerous glowing reviews, but didn't think it was roaringly funny as expected..a satire on such an obvious, easy target isn't necessarily going to be as funny as I wanted it to be..there were some entertaining flights of imagination, but I was expecting a more amazing read, could be that to spoof a genre you need to incorporate many elements of that genre, making the spoof predictable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the most trivial piece of trash that I ever purchased.  Basically no story at all.  Just sexual excapades.  A complete waste of money and time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 1 was good, but good #2 was better. I really like the fact that the writer started the 2nd book where the 1st book ended. I recommend this book and the entire trilogy. These are great \\"adult\\" books. But the nice thing is they have a plot. Great story!
B007BLDFWG|1.0|A little boring, good acting by Miss Olson (can't remember her first name). Story is a little strange, cultish. Not a thriller in my opinion. don't watch this if you are tired at all because you may fall asleep. I hate movies where nothing happens, most of the movie is a recollection of trauma to this girl.  The girl shows her boobs :)
B0013J1WKY|5.0|OMG I love this dvd set. Christina Aguilera is better live :) She is so pretty and what an entertainer :)<br />You should definitely buy this if you like XTINA!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is worth reading and having in your personal library.  It explores the medical, psychological, emotional and spiritual impacts this woman's contribution had on the lives of her family and others.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my only complaint is how difficult it is to unlock the expensive games you have to sit and play old games over and over again.
B005T87QCI|3.0|I really loved the movie real steel and I though that this would be pretty cool and kick robot butt, but as I found out that this is a VERY hard game to beat if u like challenges then this is a game for u! :/
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Great read, could not put it down in some parts. Good detail, humorous yet sincere accounts of what the guy went through and what he sees in retrospect. Enhanced edition has some nice touches with videos, it was worth buying. A great read for those interested or wishing that they could have been a SEAL.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|I saw the first thing back when it hit theaters, and it scared me half to death! When my son came to me and said that a new movie was on it's way, I was skeptical about a remake of a beloved sci-fi picture. I finally got the nerve to watch this movie and was pleasantly suprised to find out that it was not a remake, BUT A PREQUEL! For years, my friends and I always had wandered what had happened at the Norweigan camp MaCready mistakens for a Swedish camp. The utter destruction and awe of it back in 1982 are fully explained in this thrilling prequel which depicts the actual uncovering of the Thing, it's escape, and the all too familiar paranoia and suspense that made the first one wonderful! The actors and actresses do a great job in their roles and the thing scared me just as much as it did when i was in that old movie theater. I am relieved this movie was made, it is a treat for fans of the original and to newcomers of true sci-fi lore.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It servers the purpose for now...wish I had of gotten a brighter color, I love colors that pop....but it's good...it keeps my Kindle protected.  But I believe my next purchase will be a cover so I don't I have to take it off.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's obviously a copy of Mario, but it has its own perks and variations. Good graphics and clever levels. It's a lot of fun! For all those rating one star because it's just like Mario... Hello that's what makes it fun! Besides its free!! So download and enjoy all nine world's. I did:)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great for all ages! easy to play no problems loading on my fire. thumbs up NER Brothers!!!!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I got this CD for my wife. Upon the arrvial of this CD; she played it all day. Some of the songs on here took us back in time. No damage to the case or the CD itself. Stll have it in our collection of CDs
B0067R0APK|4.0|works as advertised. The widget widgets, the forecast forecasts, the lickable wallpaper is lickable.<br /><br />Also, this version is made of platinum, a very valuable element amongst you Earth people.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|get ready to invest time. not like the Oregon trail of your youth! more like wild farmville. try it out!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game is the game that is even better when you get to sit down and take a whit bravo gameloft bravo.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game lots of fun.  Very addicting!  5 year old daughter loves the ice age characters very much.  Movies are extra bonus for her.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Great game I love the story reminds me of old HP Lovecraft stories!<br />I highly recommend this game will keep you entertained and well worth the price!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really would like a refund. This is a book about torture. Quite sick and I wish I had been warned. Degrading to women.
B0055SWM08|5.0|peaceful and addicting.<br />this game helps me relax and the music is great and the puzzles are challenging. buy it now
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it - can't wait for the movie.  Much darker than the first.  I wish there was more than 3 books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so captivating.  I've never read a story along these um... lines before and was so intrigued.  Just read it... now!
B0061S0A64|5.0|NodeBeat has been interesting so far.  I wish it came with  some instructions.  There are like little lights you can place which, when connected to others, make musical notes.  The different colors make different sounds, and this is where some kind of information would be nice.  Some make cymbal sounds, others make drum sounds, and so on.<br /><br />It's been fun, though I'm not musically inclined.  I've made some interesting little tunes, but nothing I'd write home about.  It does have different waveform types, so you can even make original GameBoy-esque tunes.  It does have an automatic mode where the app makes its own music, and you can manipulate their song.<br /><br />For creating, I think it'd be best to start with a blank slate and listen to each of the node types.  Maybe there are some hidden documentation that I didn't stumble across, but exploring the nodes is still fun!  For advanced users, there's even detailed options like the ability to change the beats-per-minute (BPM), the key of the notes, and even synchronization options.
B0054LJGWS|3.0|Funny in a British kind of way, the silliness overshadows the good bits. OK for a once-only read, Gaiman's best books are elsewhere.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had all the excitement, anticipation, surprise, and good story line from beginning to end.  Not to mention the steamy love scenes.  That goes without saying on this one.  I recommend it to anyone who needs to curl up at the end of a work day and taken to another world.  I highly recommend that you read all three books of the trilogy.  You'll be sharing this one with your friends for sure.......
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really love it . lots of fun to play.I would recommend it to anyone who likes that kind of game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have recently purchased the Angry Birds Seasons and I love it it's just that I beat this one levle and it said I didn't! I know that there weren't. any lefovere pigs!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|the game is fun but you run out of energy quickly plus the animals are hard to keep up with and you end up accidentally clicking on trees and other things instead.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first two books of the series. I could not wait for the ending! I found myself struggling to get through this book. It was so very depressing. I realize the need to stress the seriousness of war, but there needs to be some element of triumph along the way. I found myself thinking, \\"Can anything good happen to this girl?\\" I was very disappointed in the ending. It was as if the author hurried up the last chapter to meet a deadline. I'm sorry to be harsh, but I expected more.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I'm running a HTC Rezound and haven't had an issue yet..phone gets warm but I learned to not overload the screen...this app makes some trippy beats and with 3 finger multitouch combining tones is awesome...and the settings...HOLY CRAP..you guys outdid yourselves! A+++++ in my book
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and could not put it down! The book starts strong and carries you throughout. Even though the books is serious- it's a great adventure!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like this app works great on kindle fire. just wish they didn't give out coins so fast so that I could want to play the game
B0061S0A64|5.0|As FAOTD there is no reason to not pick this app up. It is amazing. I have been mesmerized by it for a while now. The customizability is great and the way they designed the synth is awesome. Pick this one up even if you don't like music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very good story, very hard to put down.  Full of action and very descriptive, at the end of the story you're left wanting more.
B005FQ2H8W|1.0|Horrible transfer to DVD. This is the poorest quality DVD I have ever seen.  Too bad because it is a good movie if you like Science Fiction. It looks like it was dubbed straight from a VHS tape.  I have a copy on VHS and it looks better than this DVD. I would return it if I hadn't opened it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a great app to just pass time and make good beats. I don't know much about music theory, so I'm sure I cant use this app to its full capabilities, but the settings are there.  Highly recommended even when not free.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I usually do not write reviews, but I must in defense to the other's negative comments. This film is now my favorite movie of all time moving the Star Wars saga/films to second. I have now seen Red Tails ten times in the theater.<br /><br />Red Tails has exceeded my expectations. From beginning to end I do not want anything changed. The acting was good. The characters such as Lieutenant Ray \\"Junior\\" Gannon, Lieutenant Joe \\"Lightning\\" Little, Capitan Marty \\"Easy\\" Julian, and others captured the heroism and patriotism of the men who fought in the military for the United States of America.<br /><br />The visuals and action were amazing, especially when it came to the \\"dog fights\\". Leaving the theater every time gave me the same wow factor and amazing high as the first time I saw this film.<br /><br />For the people that do not like the film because it was not exactly historically correct should not be any bit surprised. Learn history when you are at school, at the library, from museums, educational channels on television, books, and teach yourself what schools did not teach you. There will not be a movie based on history that will always be correct. You cannot put everything that happened in a two hour and five minute movie. Educate yourself. The theater is not a substitute for education. This movie introduced lost and unknown history to a lot of people. The way Red Tails portrayed the American soldiers was good and correct for people to understand what happened.<br /><br />This is an emotional film. It shows in small amounts compared to real life the real bigotry that the Americans who happen to be black faced from their fellow citizens. As the film progresses you start to really care and become immersed with the characters and start rooting for them as they beat up on Mr. Hitler. Every time I went to see Red Tails I heard and saw many people crying. Red Tails is the only film that I have every cried. I cried almost every time I saw this film because you become one with the characters and get a very small experience of what soldiers, especially black soldiers experienced. I will not tell why because that would spoil part of the movie.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Its for kids, if you have kids they will probably like it a lot.  Its a stage above twilight and quite a few stages below harry potter (quality wise).
B003O86FMW|5.0|For a young adult novel (and second of the trilogy), Collin's delivers another strong effort.  While I don't think this measured up to the \\"Hunger Games\\", it still was a worthy follow up with some its share of twists and turns.  The first section of the book was a little slower than the \\"Hunger Games\\", but \\"Catching Fire\\" ratcheted up the pace during the last two sections for the same edge of your seat thrill ride.  Others have certainly captured the plot line, so I won't take the space to do the same.  Before I started \\"Catching Fire\\", I decided that it needed to be entertaining enough in order to compel me to read \\"Mockingjay\\".  Fortunately, I'm looking forward to the conclusion of this twisted dystopian series.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|its mediocre, but sometimes that's what you want to read after a long day at work.  If you want something easy, mind numbing, and for kids then this is for you.  I'm not being a jerk, sometimes I like to read similar things or just zonk out and watch TV without thinking about anything.  If that's what you like to do, or have kids, then this item is for you.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This version offers offers wide range of choices. I enjoy the preset puzzle designs. Multiple levels of play. Works well on my Kindle Fire.
B0061S0A64|4.0|A solid four stars, fun app for killing time.  Would be 5 stars if it was a little more visually stimulating. Best FAOTD lately. Thanks Amazon.
B0061S0A64|5.0|An easy and amazing way to experiment and create new music! Being able to change the sound from techno to drum ans guitar would be cool, and not all at once, like choose some to be guitar or cymbals and others to be techno. Great Job!
B001GWK2MC|5.0|My Grandkids love it. Arrived in 4 days... Very fast shipping. Easy take down and put up when not in use.. Will purchase another one similar just so the Grandkids have a few.
B003L77G6A|4.0|TBBT has for its first three years been consistently one of the funniest and most well written shows on major network television. The core cast has also been superb since the beginning. As with most ensemble situation comedies, however, the plot line tires a bit and the easy fix for that is to add new characters.<br /><br /> With the fourth season the writers tried to freshen things by expanding the roles of characters Amy Farrah Fowler and Bernadette Rostenkowski, and adding Priya Koothrappali, Raj's sister, as a new romantic interest for Leonard. Unfortunately the cast expansions/addition mostly provided opportunity to include more immature, hackneyed sexual jokes that became old very quickly. While still better than much of the rest of what the major networks pass off as television shows, season four lost a large part of the witty, clever humor that set TBBT apart from nearly every other situation comedy.<br /><br /> The good news is that season five is largely a return to TBBT of past years; it's a hoot-and-a-half!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great and makes Solitaire both fun and challenging. Definitely recommended.  Looks great on the tablet  too. Never stalls or hangs up.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! its just like mario eccept its the guy from the lucky charms cereal box!!! ......This sentence was only type be cause i have to have more words in order to submit this.
B00000ITOY|5.0|We love this puzzle!  I bought it for our almost 2 year old and he has loved it, along with our 4 1/2 year old boy and all kids that come over.  It teaches colors, shapes, and fine motor control.  We have only had it for 4 months, but recently a piece got lost after I held preschool at my house.  I called Plan Toys and they immediately shipped me a new one for free.  Awesome customer service!  It is a touch expensive, but a high quality toy that I would buy again in a heartbeat.  LOVE it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|keeps you busy...don't have to constantly be playing it to keep your town/ game open. lots to do and nice to.keep working to unlock the levels
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I rented it first, and we watched it with 13-years twins, and everybody liked it, so I ended up buying it.  Funny, interested, and entertaining!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game your basic solitaire without any problems. been playing for about a year now would reccomend this game to anyone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So glad there's an application like Holy Bible that helps me with my walk with God. Christians are now equipped with God's Word anywhere they go with their device. I'm doing the one year devotion from Joyce Meyer and I am really blessed. There's even an audio reading of each chapter, which is cool!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very entertaining book. I was concerned about the sexual content but it was handled ok for a 60 year old professional woman who does not ever read romance or porn. So, I am saying this is neither. However, I am not anxious to read the remaining two books in the Trilogy at this time. I would rather read something I can learn from. And one book was enough to learn about this sexual life style. [[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I'm not a Marilyn fan, so I really wanted to see this movie because of the performances. Michelle Williams was great and brought different facets of Marilyn to life: vulnerability, playful childlike qualities, insecurity, and most notably to me, the moments where she has a true picture of herself...when she knows she's putting on the Marilyn image, and when she's apologizing for causing trouble.<br /><br />I also loved Kenneth Brannaugh as Olivier, trying to recapture his youth, and I bet he loved being cast in that role.<br /><br />I didn't find Eddie Redmayne's character, Colin, very endearing. (Yes, I know the real Colin was the author of the book.) I don't know if that's the way the part was written or the way Remayne played him, or just my perception. I look forward to seeing Remayne's portrayal of Marius in Les Miserables, though.<br /><br />An aside: Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) has a small part in a horrific wig.<br /><br />Bottom line: Definitely worth a viewing. These performances should not be missed.
B0061S0A64|5.0|easy to use and a pleasure to listen to while working. this is great for all ages from 2 year old to 200. works great on my Tab and Experia (it does get a little buggy on the Experia when I turn on the status bar but doesn't affect the sound). if you love playing with music, this is for you!
B0076R62FM|4.0|I suppose you have to like Rowan Atkinson's dry, yet goofy British humor in order to enjoy this movie-- but if you do, it's fun.<br />There were lots of good gags and the plot was good enough to maintain interest between the gags.<br />It's also OK for kids, being PG.  My 10-year-old thought it was hilarious.<br />I'll give that it's no comic masterpiece, but it made for an entertaining evening.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really good. I am not in to a lot of the BDSM, but I found that the book captured my attention as we began to learn more about the main characters. Suprisingly, I was worried that I would not like Ana, which would make finishing this book a challenge. But she was honest and direct. I loved the emails--very cute touch. Honestly, I couldn't put it down and am itching for the next one. Depending on your reading preference, this may not be the one for you. If you like romance and the love scenes do not bother you, I say go for it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Much cooler than any description can make it sound.  If you like cool rhythm sounds, it starts off with a random arrangement, which you can then add an accompaniment by tapping on the screen keyboard-style, or adding your own \\"nodes\\" to generate a rhythm all your own.  Perfect to listen to in an office environment or while trying to write code!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am in love with this app! it is great because it allows so many options, some being to download the actual video or just download the music... you just press the search button and type in what you want and it comes up... you press the title and then select the option you want... the only thing I don't like is that if you download music the first song you download's screen shot that comes up will be it for every video.. if that doesn't make sense now it will make sense later... I would absolutely get this app again and tell my friends to get it also
B006ON41FC|5.0|good. game anyone can play it my 2 year old tries to play and its funny. everyone should play. or have on there tables.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|You open the app and it crashes immediately every time. What more can I say? It simply does not open. I have no idea how the actual app is.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I love Sylvia Day and am currently loving her paranormal angel series. Bared to You caught my eye on fictfact as an ad. My first thought was to purchase immediately on my kindle without reading about it too much. When I read the first chapter I had to pause. It seemed a little familiar and sure enough it reminded my of the first chapter of 50 shades. Of course I couldnt get through that novel so I cant compare more than the fact that Bared to You is written in the first person and the hero is rich.<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />Ok, I loved the story of Eve a new resident of New York for a job at an ad agency and the passion that springs up between she and the hero Gideon Cross(super rich hottie). Even initially resist the attraction but Gideon pursues her heavily. This relationship was all over the place and I love that Eve says herself that two dysfunctional people dont belong together. Both of them have issues galore but neither denies them. Gideon accepts that he has never had a real relationship with a woman before but tries hard to be what Eve needs. There are some strange things going on with his family that Day only touches on but leaves readers intrigued. Cary, Eve's room mate is the BEST friend a girl could have but he has some huge issues as well regarding relationships. There were moments in this story that annoyed me about the characters arguing and Eve's tendency to run and then there were moments where Gideon about melted my heart. All this between wanting to slap Cary for his destructive behaviors.<br /><br />Sylvia Day is a great author and Bared to You is a deep erotic novel with some heavy sensual scenes and some seriously emotional ones that will make you fall in love with the characters
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful App that I have on my Kindle Fire and also my IPhone.  Nice to have the Bible at my fingertips.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Didn't know what to expect, but this game turned out to be excellent.  Good atmosphere and attention to detail-which really makes a big difference.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game.  so fun!  it reminds me of super Mario brothers.  it is very addicting and I am sure my kids will love to play it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I chose this book because friends recommended it highly.  I expected a really good read, but was not impressed.  The premise for the book is inprobable.<br />The first person narrator was as emotionally mature as my 12 year old neice, not the  college graduate described within.  Few people would jump into the activities described as willingly as Anastasia, at least without some type of financial gain.  I stopped reading after she signed a contract.  Don't want to give details about the book, I stopped reading on page 122.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I cannot wait for Season 2!  I also may buy another set for a friend because they loved the show so much.
0439023513|3.0|I really liked the Hunger Games (despite myself) and I thought Catching Fire was even better.  Everyone had told me how brutal and action packed Mockingjay was and it just was not meant to be.  The series was always predictable but this one is the most out of the three.  Katniss grows to be even more unlikable in the book, as does Gale.  Haymitch is not used very well either and it seems he takes a backseat to different characters.<br /><br />Worst of all was the ending.  The ending became so convoluted that the reader felt Collins did not know how to end the series.  One of the most brutal parts of the book reminded me of real life situations in Afghanistan.  I won't spoil it but there are parts that resemble what the Soviet Union did to Afghan children when they tried to invade.  They would leave shiny bombs so the kids woul seem that and this is was toys and then it would go off either killing the child or severely maiming them.  I did enjoy the series overall, but I did not care for this type of book from her.

It's a 2 dollar program..  Just relax and enjoy something good...
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game. passes the time away easily, absolutely fun. I would recommend to all my friends without hesitation totally
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun, its very addicting, and its pretty easy to get the hang of. I just started playing a few days ago, so I hope it stays as exciting. I wouldn't spend any real money on the energy n stuff, but hopefully there will b ways to earn some.
0307593312|5.0|I loved this book. You can read the full review of it on my reviews blog: marywwaltersbookreviews dot wordpress dot com<br /><br />There are so many memories from this novel that will last as long as my own memory lasts (I hope. I don't have time to read it again. Although I'd like to. Right now, in fact. Maybe I will) - the comatose father, the train rides, the house in the mountains where Fuka-Eri lives with her foster father, the television fee collector, the town of cats. I feel as though I've been there, but have become disoriented on the journey - I don't understand exactly where I've been, and I know that it was fantasy, but the detail made it real.  That is Murakami's power.<br /><br />\\"If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation,\\" Tengo's father tells him. Not everything in 1Q84 can be explained, and it doesn't need to be.<br /><br />Part mystery, part fantasy, part romance, part allegory, part everything and anything, IQ84 is in sum a literary tour de force that will have readers and critics talking for years.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|An interesting and thought-provoking film. Five stars, but I have some minor reservations. Lets psychoanalyze this:<br /><br />1] Jung. While certainly a womanizer, Carl Jung was quite mainstream. Though he and his patient Sabina Speilrein were lovers, Jung didn't spank her in the bedroom with his belt. Not even for medicinal purposes. Did this come from the director's fertile imagination or his suppressed desires?<br /><br />2] Freud. It was bold, but silly to cast Aragon of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (Viggo Mortensen) as Sigmund Freud. This didn't pay off, because Viking-looking VIggo (Isn't he Danish?) looks more like Jung than Freud. Freud was 5' 7'\\" (170 cm), while Viggo is six feet-tall. Details are important. While Viggo acts well, he doesn't look believable. But perhaps Freud himself wouldn't have mind it?<br /><br />3] Frau Spielrein. Making \\"Pirates of the Caribbean's\\" Keira Knightly into Sabina Spielrein didn't quite work either in my view. Sabina was attractive to Jung because she was (apart from being neurotic) very rich, very bright and very exotic. She was a Russian. She came from Rostov-on-Don, heiress to the fortune of a Russian-Jewish merchant. She spoke German with a Russian accent. Correct me if I am wrong, but Keira doesn't fit this profile, although she did best she could with her West London accent.<br /><br />Perhaps I am nitpicking. Overall, the film is good and, in cinematographic terms, good-looking. The music-score is nice. While casting is overall suspicious, Vincent Cassel is brilliant as Otto Gross, a deranged over-sexed psychoanalyst. Jung's wife is also well cast. The costumes are tremendous; the atmosphere of the times is well reproduced. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and films for grown-ups.<br /><br />P.S. The main argument between Jung and Freud perhaps should have been better explained in the film: it was about nature of the libido. Freud conceived of the libido as a quantitative (or \\"economic\\") concept: it is an energy which can increase or decrease, and which can be displaced. Freud insisted on the sexual nature of the energy, and he maintained a dualism in which the libido is opposed to another (non-sexual) form of energy. Jung opposed this dualism, positing a single form of life-energy, which is neutral in character. I believe Freud was nearer the truth: at least he stayed scientific, while Jung descended into the alchemy.\\"economic\\") concept: it is an energy which can increase or decrease, and which can be displaced.

0763644765|5.0|This book has quickly become the best loved book in our house.  My toddler walks around demanding we read it to her at all times.  And when we don't read it to her, she sits on her potty (fully dressed, sometimes covered with a blanket for privacy) and reads it to herself.<br /><br />On a side note: my husband who does not love children's books as I do, loves this book so much he's considering purchasing other Leslie Patricelli books.

B005KIR1MM|5.0|My two year old daughter loves her Duplo Legos and the Animal Clinic is the perfect addition to her Duplo Zoo set. But the Lego Duplo Animal Clinic is highly overpriced on Amazon.com and I found the same item for $25 less at ToysRUS. I will return the one which I bought on amazon.com. I'm more careful now to check and compare prices before ordering on amazon.com as I run across various items now which either list the incorrect Mfr list price or are highly overpriced on amazon.com

B002AKKLIY|3.0|Boughtthe set after seeing some great up to date vids on youtube.<br />I personally thought the group had dismemebered years ago. The newer stuff is stong and really rocks, so I thought I'd grab this set to catch up life after \\"The Final Count down\\".<br />Well, there is a number of great hits on these two disc. But there is much more that are total filler.<br />I wanted to hear ROCK! and got ballads and what seems to me a lot wanna be hits. This collection is ok but don't waste more than a few bucks on it. It will be one you'll see in a thrift store or yard sale in the near future

B0071MV540|5.0|I loved this movie!<br /><br />I watched a rental copy here on Amazon.com 6 times then I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD copy so I could have it in my movie library.<br /><br />Some of my favorite actors are in the movie, Ben Stiller, Eddy Murphy and Alan Alda.<br /><br />The plot is clever and the ending is very unexpected.  I won't go through the entire movie but in a nutshell, here's what happens.<br /><br />Ben Stiller's character Josh Kovacs is the General Manager of a high priced condo building in New York called The Tower.  Each unit in the building costs $5 million or more dollars and comes with a staff that caters to the owners 24/7.  Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is a big time money manager who owns the penthouse apartment.  Early in the movie, we see the FBI arrest Arthur Shaw for fraud and theft.  We find out that Josh Kovacs had asked Arthur Shaw to manage the pension money for the staff at the Tower so everyone has lost their money.  After one employee tries to commit suicide, Josh decides to take matters into his own hands and try to find Arthur Shaw's secret stash of money.  He believes it could be hidden in a wall safe.  So Josh recruits some of the other people in the building, employees and one former owner to help him break into Arthur Shaws apartment.<br /><br />Without giving away the whole plot, the movie is about how they go about doing this and the ending is very unexpected.  I really enjoyed this movie and I can't wait to get my copy from Amazon.com.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|A fabulous EP at a great price. All 4 cuts are a classic retrospective of their old raw sound. Though Metallica's evolution over the years has been epic, it is good they went back to gain NEW ground. Looking forward to hearing their upcoming album.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not bad just annoying having to wait so long to recoup energy all in all not to bad of a game.
B0046JRZBI|5.0|This is an excellent album any way you look at it. I would definitely recommend it to those new to Dylan's music. It is also historical in the fact that Dylan was \\"going electric\\" here as well as moving into a more surreal lyricism in his writing. This album is to Highway 61 as Rubber Soul was to Revolver. Great mono sound, too!

B0015DROBO|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo really caught me by surprise. It had been recommended to me by friends for quite some time, I just simply never got around to it. However I picked it up on my Kindle and finished it in less than two days. It is the first book in a long time that I literally could not put down. I'm a critical judge and avid reader so for me to say that means a lot.<br /><br />The book has a very different air, it is mired in political scandal, business fraud, murder mystery, investigations, sexual abuse, and more. It simply is a book that takes a broad range of topical materials and somehow unites them all under one thread. It has a very meandering approach that I really liked as there are multiple plotlines rather than one simple rise, crescendo, and fall that really felt satisfying to explore.<br /><br />I felt like Stieg Larsson really created a world. The book explores a Swedish setting that really had an alternative feel for me that added character and more to the novel. The characters are dynamic while still completely believable. It transcends historical boundaries exploring a particular family's past over more than 60 years or so. In doing this Larsson has created a novel that isn't a mere quick read but really takes on a life of it's own.<br /><br />Overall I must say this is one of the few books in a long time I would deem as \\"original\\". It felt like something fresh to me, rather than just a typical \\"thriller\\" / your average read that is semi-predictable. I feel like Stieg has written his own unique creation. I just now bought the second book in the series without hesitation and can't wait to read it.<br /><br />Don't hesitate in picking up this book, it's a must.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun ... a Lot like Mario still very entertaining and a great way to pass time. leprechaun twist is a cute idea.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This was a great book! It was not what I expected in a good way.  The only reason it did recieve 5 stars from me was because Travis seemed to be a little too much sometimes.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be troubling and quite vulgar.  I read until I realized that it was not going to change.  I would not suggest this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game.  I remember the original from when I was a kid, and it is great nostalgic fun.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja is a fun game and I enjoyed playing it. I now have it on both my kindle fire and iPod touch. I cant complain too much about the ads. Ignoring them is rather easy and if it dosent hurt anything, then I don't see a reason to complain!
B000P0J09W|5.0|This is a good quality DVD of a GREAT kid's adventure.  I was a little frustrated at some crassness in the beginning, but on the whole it is a good film.

0307888908|3.0|If you've read a few business books -- either about starting your own company, the principles of business or even about stock trading -- the Start-up of You will be of little value to you. It is very much a beginner's guide; good if you're just wetting your feet, but relatively useless if you're looking for something to elevate you/your business to another level of competition. In essence, the book tells you that it's safer to take calculated risks than remain content with the status quo, espouses the powers of networking and the importance of building transferable skills. These are all excellent points, and as a general primer, the Start-up of You is worth examining. Personally, I think that general, broad business rules work better than ultra-complex and difficult to understand ideas, so I have no problem that the tips and tricks in this book are simple. It's just that you've probably seen all of them before if you've read any other business books.<br /><br />The book goes off the rails a little bit when it resorts to anecdotal story-telling to \\"prove\\" its points. It cherry-picks a few wildly successful people (with powerful contacts) such as Sheryl Sandberg (COO of Facebook) and extrapolates that what worked for her will work for others. This type of \\"proof\\" is guilty of survivorship bias; having a never-say-die attitude, contingency plans and working your network of contacts can certainly lead to success. However, in its optimism, the Start-up of You smooths over these narratives to make its point. There are plenty of people who did exactly what Sandberg did, but failed -- I would have liked to see examples of what didn't work, as one can usually learn more from a multitude of failures than a few success stories.<br /><br />Start-up of You shares its over-reliance on rah-rah optimism and narrative fallacies with many other business book. Unusually, however, the book contains a subtle, yet constant plugging of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman's professional networking site. While I believe the site has useful applications, it's annoying that certain parts of the book -- particularly the last portion -- devolve into the merits of networking and LinkedIn. This advertising is irritating and more than a bit insulting; purchasing a book for the privilege of being advertised to may be a clever way of generating revenue, but it is hardly endearing.<br /><br />As a starting point, this book is a nice introduction to the challenges of becoming an entrepreneur. It is about 100 pages too long and a bit too general if you've read other business books. I would recommend reading Guy Kawasaki's The Art of the Start instead, which is an excellent, well-written and relatively short resource for both beginning and experienced entrepreneurs.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay, the book itself began slower thn it's predecessors, but after a certain point you can't stop reading. It reaches the point where the realisatioon that the series is approaching its end hits you and you're left reding the final 80 pages wondering: \\"How can Collins finish this off in a way that won't spoil the series and completeley depress me beyond belief?\\". And, she manages to deliver the best ending The Hunger Games could've had: a happy ending. I myself thought it was one of the greatest books and endings I have ever read; definitely the best in the series because the ending was so amazing. I wasn't disappointed and I know you wao't be either. If you are... then there's something wrong with you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i am having so much fun with this game, but i am trying to visit friends and it says 'you need to update the game before you can perform this action. restart the game to receive the update.' so i restart the game and there is no update available. i keep getting the same message and i even tried to completely shut down my kindle fire and restarted it and still the same thing. i went to my app update area and it shows no updates available. what should i do? i want to visit friends LOL!!!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|How weird that after reading a book with domestic abuse just the other day and then I pick this up and it deals with sexual abuse.<br />Well written with good balance between info and show.  Lots of sex, erotically written for the most part. The basis of the plot is the stuff of the romance genre: gorgeous, super wealthy guy meets beautiful girl with her own money. He wants a simple relationship but she's so special he decides he needs her to be his girlfriend. They both arrive in the relationship with a ton of of baggage, carry on, checked, steamer trunks of baggage. He has never dealt with his baggage and he's going to have to in order to be in a relationship.<br /><br />I have to tell you I am in a quandary.  I really liked the book and had a hard time putting it down.  I was surprised by the ending I felt it was abrupt and it's a long time to October when Sylvia states in her website that she is shooting for release of DEEPER IN YOU.<br /><br />I have to keep remembering that the amount of sex had and orgasms achieved do not have to be biologically possible in a romance novel. Romance is a form of fantasy and anything can happen more or less.<br /><br />There's an odd, and I am not sure resolved brush with dominance and submission. It's a bit weird since both parties are recovering for sexual abuse. But, I applaud Ms. Day for taking this sensitive, completely un-erotic issue on in a piece of scorching erotic writing. It's a bit unsettling, as the issue should be.  But, approaching it in a romance story, that takes chutzpa.<br /><br />There are short explorations into Eva's relationship with her bisexual, male model, abuse survivor.  I think it needs to have more importance in the plot; right now he's like a scratchy old sweater with sentimental value.
0307454568|5.0|I am practically convulsing with sobs knowing that there are no more books in the Millennium Series and that Larsson is gone from this world.  He displayed immense talent and this trilogy has captivated me to no end.  In Hornet's Nest, all of the pieces of Lisbeth Salander's puzzle fall in place.  I must admit, this was the most challenging of the three novels because there are so many characters and details and conspiracies and intricacies and OH MY GOODNESS so much craziness.  The incredibly written characters of Lisbeth and Kalle Blomkvist have left an impression on me and this book offered a phenomenal, satisfying, and vindicating conclusion.

0071762345|4.0|Social media networks have proven that they are the next big thing for company promotion.  They are changing the way companies communicate with their consumers and prospects.  Facebook and Twitter are here to stay.  Anyone who plans to successfully keep their consumers engaged or abreast of what their company has to offer must learn how to manage these networks.<br />Let's face it, when we see a request from someone asking to Like them on Facebook, it doesn't feel genuine. But when we ask a friend for a referral or recommendation about a product or service we take them very seriously.  Believe it or not that is what social media networking is making very easy to share with the public.<br />Dave Kerpen's  Likeable Social Media, How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook is definitely worth reading since his company Likeable Media is a 3-time winner of the WOMMY awards for excellence  from the Word of Mouth Marketing Association.  Yes, this is a real association.  So what's in it for the consumer to Like you on Facebook or follow you on Twitter?  According to Kerpen, \\"It's not about you, it's about your customers.  Facebook is too big to tell people to like you without telling them why. It's essential to develop that value proposition and integrate it into your communications with customers and prospects.\\"  Getting to Like is a powerful step for a company because once a customer gives their seal of approval for your company, you have access to all their friends.  Their friends will make a decision based on their Likes because they trust their friends' choices.<br />As an entrepreneur, you have to determine the value propositions you are offering to those you are asking to Like your company.  Value propositions vary from industry to industry.  A value proposition for a car dealer wouldn't be the same for a bakery.  The consumer is always asking \\"what's in it for me?\\" You have to give them a reason to Like your company.  What you are going to give, to get what you want.  Think like a consumer, not an entrepreneur.<br />Another component of the social media is that it is becoming a reliable source for learning about a company and how they value their customers. When companies respond to bad publicity via Facebook or Twitter, customers feel that the companies value them and are sincere.  \\"No human is perfect, and therefore nor is any organization.  If you can respond quickly and authentically with an apology and a solution you can avoid any damage to your reputation,\\" says Kerben.  A while ago, people would research companies on the Internet.  The social media networks are changing that at a speed faster than anyone ever imagined since they are becoming more respected and acceptable.<br />Facebook and Twitter have matured beyond the idle updates they were known for when they first started less than 10 years ago.

B0013TPVGK|5.0|If you're bass player of any level this book will have something to inspire you. There are also little gems of wisdom in here scattered about for percussionists and other musicians but the focus, as we would expect, is on the bass.<br /><br />The book is ironically named because Wooten doesn't directly issue any lessons at all. He tells a story that has exercises and techniques woven into it. There are a few descriptions of complete exercises, but mostly there are little \\"leads\\" only covered briefly or in passing, for the reader to pick up and run with if they should choose to.  The genius of this technique is that it inspires genuine curiosity.<br /><br />The book is short and easy to read but its messages are layered and complex. I will definitely read it again. It will be one of a handful of books I have ever read twice.

0345803485|1.0|I thought I would give this book a try as I work at chapters and it seems like every woman in the city is after it. The writing is absolutely terrible. She repeats the same words over and over again (i.e. murmur, delicious, and \\"down there,\\" to name a few) and there is absolutely no depth. I am half way through and I quit! This book is definitely not worth the hype or the price. It should be a .99$ book for the kindle, not a penny more.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a fun classic game of solitaire that I play almost every day. the kids really like to play it too.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|As others noted, this is a compilation of older blog posts, which is worth the price of a couple of bucks for me to have it one place. Mark gives great advice on how to find yourself in business in a badly written English. Get the message and ignore the style.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app with many different customizable plans to fit your busy schedule.  It helps you to find a version that you like as well.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I have loads of music.  Mostly hard rock and heavy metal (I have to be able to understand words and good music construction).<br /><br />My Lenny Kravitz greatest hits is fantastic.  I would recommend to anyone who likes a good, well controlled performance.  I love it.  I don't always need heavy music.  Just damn good music.
B005LAIHAY|4.0|Lockout is the type of movie that you need to go into expecting nothing from, because the unexpected humor, zippy dialogue, rapid-fire action scenes, and cast of quirky characters is about as entertaining as it gets.  Even my stodgy spouse enjoyed this movie and laughed aloud at times.  There are some plot holes and a few maguffins that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why events happened and why characters acted the way they did, but who cares?  Have some fun with this romp and let your hair down.  It's an entertaining 1:50 of movie mayhem and fun.<br /><br />This movie is part Escape From New York, part Die Hard, part Star Wars, and part Mad Max.  It's a blast!
B0045I3EJC|5.0|this movie is so beautiful, the performance of jared leto is great and the storyline is very interesting,  i really recomend this movie...
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Fantastic read, well worth waiting for and looking forward to the next book. Another Jeffrey Archer success, leaves you wanting more.
0553386794|5.0|When my mother handed me the Game of Thrones I didn't want to read them because of the length of if, but as soon as I started, I couldn't put it down!<br />I highly recommend it if you are prepared for a really \\"heavy\\" lecture. It takes time to read it, though it is a page turner.<br />There are amazing characters, they feel so real and you can really feel identified with them sometimes in the way they think. One of the cool things I think is that it comes to a point when you are not able to distinguish between \\"the villain or the hero\\", which I think is great because you don't support any team, it is a story about magic and families, gods and walking-dead creatures, betrayal and loss. Everything you need to call this an amazing book.<br />Just one thing, expect lots of deaths from you favorite characters. It takes time to let them go, seriously.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I ordered for a friend -- she is very happy with it and all else involved as cost, shipping and condition of purchase.  Thanks
B002KKCXTE|3.0|Amazon should also take note of this as well, as I UP FRONT will admit I DO NOT own this product. BUT, I do however own these:<br /><br />The Next Generation:  http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Generation-Generations-Insurrection/dp/B002I9Z8GW/ref=pd_bxgy_mov_img_b<br />The Original--Star Trek:  http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Original-Collection-Captains/dp/B001TH16DI/ref=pd_bxgy_mov_img_b<br /><br />Now, the 100+ dollar (presently it is set at 184.99$--nearly 200$, a complete and utter joke if you ask me) boxed set that you can buy above has all the Original and Next Generation Movies, plus two extras.<br /><br />However, the 35$ The Next Generation (Blu-Ray, full-set, no differences in production before you ask) Movie Collection is a five-disc set.  It has all four movies plus a extras disc.  Then we have The Original Star Trek Movie Collection (Blu-Ray, full-set, no difference in production quality), again we have ALL of the movies produced, six in total PLUS a bonus disc.  This means that essentially between the \\"Star Trek Film Box\\" and just buying the other two sets independently you'll be missing out on basically NOTHING.  UNLESS, those two discs somehow have completely different material and to be honest, it would have to be two more Star Trek Films as we're talking about an additional sum of 100$ dollars to be paid to have the same thing.<br /><br />I thought since I had bought the two \\"smaller\\" versions that I would put my review here as Amazon flashed it up at the bottom of my screen to see if I was interested.  At first I looked at it and thought, \\"Oh great, I just bought the other two and NOW I find the *better version...\\".  I'm glad I got the other ones, this one is a wallet vacuum.<br /><br />Unless you are an eccentric Trek fan that MUST HAVE them all (more or less; plus those two discs may have a little bit of content that was missed out on and can be found nowhere else--but, of course the other sets will have their own; it's in the end a moot point really--you really want the movies, unless you are said Trek fan), this object is not for you!  Do yourself a favor and buy the other two I linked above.  Those are both terrific items and are actually priced competitively.  This thing is priced for jewel store owners.<br /><br />The contents get a 5/5, but the unnecessary price increase--apparently created for people that don't bother to look around for two seconds (as Amazon nowadays MOST LIKELY has links to the cheaper collections while you are looking at this, due to their similarity ad system--which I actually like), but if you do look around you got lucky like I said above, paid much less, and still got that 5/5 item--YET we are talking about this BOX and it's pricing gives it a WELL deserved 1/5 (0/5, if I could).<br /><br />BUY the other links!  I hope this review helps and more importantly saves you A LOT of money.
B0000041LL|5.0|Most recordings of Beethoven's masterpieces (String Quartets) have players huffing, puffing, moaning and even groaning - here, The Quartetto Italiano provide flawless (therefore astounding/soul enriching) performances of these works. And if beauty and perfection in art remains a flawed depiction of the ideal Platonic universe that is out of our reach, then having players who perform without the sweat, moans, groans and other human biological noises of most other string quartet ensembles is something very special and very precious! My highest recommendation for this set! -- Another outfit that recorded great performances of Beethoven's quartets without extraneous noises was the Melos Quartet - A big \\"Si\\" to that set as well!
B0010X73ZG|5.0|very good movie, stephen king shows how we react when we are at the lowest level of survival, thirsty creatures from another dimension creating horror
0143119680|5.0|I don't usually like books with cliffhanger endings. Which is all I'll say about the ending, but you've been forewarned. I'm certainly glad I was forewarned because that allowed me to lie back and think of England while reading and not mind it so much when I got there.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book tremendously, despite being left hanging. The characters were well-drawn, the writing was lively, the plot intriguing. And it had that certain something that makes a five-star book for me: I didn't want it to end. Not just because I wanted to know what happened next (I do), but because I really liked spending time with these people in their strange world. Yes, there were some things I didn't like. There's one significant instance of plotting-by-stupidity, one of my least favorite plot devices. And there is a hell of a lot of diddling around one element of the central relationship that really telegraphs (I'm sure) a major plot point to come in the following books. I have no inside knowledge, just making a guess. But really, so much diddling and not diddling is just too obvious. Even so, even with these elements, the story pulled me along, and made me a mostly happy to be there. It would be unreasonably harsh of me to give this a 4.5 instead of a full five when I enjoyed myself so much.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I wanted to read the book to see what everyone was talking about. Well....a decent book, but I wasn't in love with the subject matter.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I bought this for my sis n law for christmas.  It was perfect and the picture quality was great.  She loved it...so no complaints.
B0063GORYU|5.0|No kidding I sit at my computer and play this version of Spider on my K-Fire! Got me a capacitive stylus and it's so easy... no more RSI from the darned mouse! The bug-me screens are no bother and game works in portrait or landscape mode automatically.<br /><br />Good job designers!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Looks boring. Not my type of game. Won't even bother downloading. I give it credit though because it's free.<br />Gameloft should release better games for the KF.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game works great on the Droid 4.  It is a fun concept for a puzzel game.  I liked the over all tone and feel of the game. I'm not  sure emersive can apply to a puzzel game, but I found it engaging and har to put down.  I alos like that they included a history of the games creation.  It is short, but you can see how the look shifted from simple primary color, to a more sophistocate over all look and theme.  My only complaint is that I finished it so quickly (which is partially my own fault for playing it late at night rather than sleeping).
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series has had me riveted! I'm a bit older, but it's a \\"Brave New World\\"/\\"1984\\" for the youth of today! I read all 3 books in the series back to back and I look forward to finding similar reading material that sparks the imagination and gives such insight into human nature!
057809665X|5.0|In the interests of disclosure, Robin is a close friend of mine as well as someone I've worked with for several years.  I met him sometime after I won the reality show, Survivor: Cook Islands, back in 2006.  Robin leads the FBI's elite Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program (BAP), and I've helped him teach a number of courses on human behavior at the FBI Academy and in major field offices around the country.  Over the course of our work together, I've had the opportunity to observe Robin and his techniques closely, and I've been profoundly impressed with both his analytical understanding of human behavior as well as his ability to apply theory to reality.  I've read many books from academics who lack practical experience.  I've also met field experts who are skilled at reading and influencing people, but can't articulate their methods in a way that is learnable and actionable by others.  What differentiates Robin is that he writes from the perspective of both an intellectual and a practitioner.  His experience in one role greatly informs the other, and the synergistic benefits of writing from these dual perspectives clearly show through in his book.  Robin really knows his stuff, and he's done a masterful job of distilling and explaining key concepts, and articulating how they can be used in practice.  Nearly all of the principles and techniques he describes in his book are ones that I've used to obtain favorable outcomes in my career as well as on Survivor.  My only regret is that he didn't write this book sooner such that I could have benefited from these insights at an earlier point of my life.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding people and wants practical advice on how to influence them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|absolutely love this game. just need neighbors. it's cute and so far I haven't had any problems with it. real nice
B007SYWFRM|5.0|in the point of view of a 13 year old girl (me) I say its awesome!!!! its fun and you don't have to worry about the farming that we all hate!!
B0061S0A64|5.0|But this thing is awesome. It's got an organic, surprisingly powerful interface and everything is customizable to get a unique song every time you're feeling creative. Really, really like it. Nice job AffinityBlue and thank you Amazon. And superman, you're boss.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|Fun story with cool effects.  Not too much thinking required; a nice fun story for an easy afternoon.  Lots of funny lines, though, and well worth watching.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Overall, this is a great app. The only problem I have is that it does not have the full-function properties as does ebay on a regular computer. Maybe this can be fixed in the future.
0062082353|5.0|As a literary book I'm sure people would knock it, however this is a soldier telling his stories. So the stories and sentences are simple and plain. The impact is huge though. Bottom line this guy is a badass. He stayed away form the politics of war and just told us how much ass was kicked over there. I'm not condoning ware blah blah blah, but hey when you do it hard... Glad this man was on our side.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You know when you find yourself laughing out loud when reading on the train to work that this is a good book.  Fey's dry wit comes through in her writing.  Quick read, and well worth the time.

I joined Amazon Prime and in addition to being able to watch fine quality TV and movies I get free shipping and a Kindle loan book once a month.

B007GU5COG|4.0|Hard to believe that it has been 30 years since George Michael and his days with Wham! had started. Through his highs and lows, he has honestly made some of the most distinctive music in the world that continues to get better with time and age. Something that very few and farther between artists have really learned from him. That is honestly because the songs are still as guilty pleasures in spirit and heart. He showed that in the 80's, ranking high with artists like Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. But if there is one thing about George is that he is still here, and has made good choices with the way his music captures the heart. While he hasn't made anything new in the past several years, he still show no sign of his music getting old. While he has battled some vices, including being open for accepting that he is gay and a recent turnstyle against pneumonia, he did beat his odds well. Now that he is 30 years into the business, he has a lot to celebrate.<br /><br />George Michael's 2008 release of Twenty-Five is a consistent reflection of his solo days and his days with his work with Wham!. The collection handles well by bringing in his biggest ballads, as well as his deepest standards that withstood the test of time. Every song has been remastered well, and include hits like Wake Me Up Before You Go Go, Faith, the driven covers like the intimate The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, to the classic Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John and the overshadowed As with Mary J. Blige. Every song never gets old, but there are a few heavy snubs for the album. The biggest one is I Want Your Sex, as well as I Knew You Were Waiting For Me. While its video is here on this extended set, the song isn't standing alone as a download, as well as his rendition of Somebody To Love with the surviving members of Queen. There are though some songs that make up for that overshadowing like Father Figure, and a intimate contemporary duet of Heal The Pain with Paul McCartney. While there are videos of his classics here, it still could've been more for the songs to stand alone to make it even stronger.<br /><br />Nevertheless, George Michael's Twenty-Five is still a strong collection of his big hits. If you are honestly new to George Michael, than this would be a good record to buy. While I do wish that it did have more from his days with Wham! like The Edge Of Heaven and Bad Boys to just name a few of there classic songs, still it stands up well. There are fewer artists that are out there right now that still stands out well from the 80's, that are with great music alone. George Michael is only one of a few of them. While he hasn't made anything new in awhile, his classics stand tall just like he has. \\"Don't You Think He Is Looking Older?,\\" as he sang at one point? Not really, he has gotten better with age.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Videos: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+hile there are videos of his classics here, it still could've been more for the songs to stand alone to make it even stronger.<br /><br />Nevertheless, George Michael's Twenty-Five is still a strong collection of his big hits.

B0064BWE8U|3.0|What can I say. I find it difficult to review this one. I did enjoy this book, I even laugh out loud a couple of times and I definetelly loved the email exchanges between Sam and Poppy but all in all, when I finished it, I didnt feel like I had found a new favourite. Poopy is a likeable character, even if she was a little too much of a whiny sometimes. I won't go through the plot again as it's already been done in other reviews, but Sam was a Luke copycat (shopaholic) and Magnuss... I dont even understand why she fell in love with him to start with. The idea is interesting but I felt that it dragged a lot and I found myself skipping pages and looking for the \\"interesting\\" parts. Would I recommend this book? Definetely but just to someone who already knew Kinsella's work, I wouldn't recommend it for a non initiated because they won't find here the \\"something\\" that made the first 3 shopaholic magic.<br />A good way of spending 4-5 hours but not one of the books that I would re-read every year.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is addicting! the background music is so soothing you will want to play for hours.<br />There are many different levels as well so you won't become bored very easily.
B006H4DBA4|3.0|OK, even if the price is great (cannot make any better) if you have never read anything from Sophie Kinsella before, do not start by this one. It's a very short story about 6 women having pre-natal lessons with a very popular guru and this \\"experience\\" helps them realise the mistakes they are making or about to make with their husbands/kids. Very Christmas Carol, but I couldnt find any of the humor I like so much about her previous stories. If you really wanna have a good laugh and a great chick lit experience, read the first three shopaholics, those were great and I recommend them without hesitation, her latest works lack a bit of that \\"something\\" that makes a great chick book. All in all, read this one only if you already like her work, not in order to form an opinion of Ms Kinsella as an author.
B002IFT1ZA|2.0|I bought the Blu Ray version of Game of Thrones, having seen Jaason Momoa in Conan, and I wanted to see more barbarian warrior type action.<br />The characters are very interesting, and the range of character viewpoints hold your attention.  You find yourself rooting (barracking for any Aussies reading this) for the Starks as the good guys, and apart from Tyron Lannister, I found myself roundly detesting the Lannister family.  Queen Cersei was the queen you loved to hate.  It is sort of like the War of the Roses meats Robert E. Howard, plenty to enjoy for those who like fantasy stories, and period pieces.<br /><br />But knowing this was HBO, having bought Rome and having to fast forward through all the bawdy fleshy scenes, I was expecting some pornographic parts to look away from; but I was very dissappinted to the vast amount of time spent on the bedroom scenes.  Then there was the ridiculous amount of swearing and references to women's and men's private parts.  Did these men in the great houses talk about anything else?  So any comparisons between George R. R. Martin and the late J. R. Tolkein are very absurd.  Then we were treated to nutty Lady Arryn breast feeding her neurotic son in the throne room in full view of the whole court.  Not very believable.<br /><br />Jamie Lannister being interrupted in the midst of incestous adultrey, and then shoving Bran Stark out of a castle window was disturbing, and on and on it went.  The only love making that showed any true tenderness was between Deaenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo; but very upsetting they killed off Khal Drogo with a small flesh wound that somehow became fatally infected.  Not very convincing at all.  I hate it when my favourites get killed off.  We could have had huge battle scenes of Khal Drogo and his Dothraki hordes invading Westros, but instead we get more smut, more cursing, and more intreague, and very little real battles.  Mostly after effects of battles.<br /><br />The sex scenes between Tyron Lannister and various prostitutes seemed ridiculous given their size difference.<br /><br />But what really bugged me was all the interesting characters being killed off and all the slimy morally challenged person's getting off without a scratch.  Among the most evil in the sesries is Peter Baelish, or littlefinger.  If ever some back stabber deserved to get run thourh it was him.  But instead we have the best character in the show Eddard Stark getting his head chopped off.  By the third book the Starks have a huge plate of misfortune served up to them.<br /><br />So overall, I won't be buying the future DVDs of other seasons, given that the smutty component gets worse and worse, and the fact that all the good guys get killed off and you are left with nobody with morals to root for.  I would give this only 2 stars out of five, thumbs down on any sequel.<br /><br />The whole story would have been more interesting with some changes to who lives and who dies, and we could have done without the swearing and smutty sex scenes, usually 2-3 at least in every episode.  HBO needs to get out of the gutter and do some real dramatic mini=series like Hollywood did at one time.  Without the constant swearing, and bedroom scenes (give us a hint, not give us a camera angle like peeping Toms), and references to men's and women's private parts; this could have been something you could have watched with your older teenagers and had some great discussions about moral choices.  But don't expect much morals from this show, nice guys finishi last is the lesson you take away from this HBO series that drags the fantasy genre through the gutter, and leaves the end product very tarnished.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie. Michelle Williams is so great. Im telling you, she was marilyn brought back to life. I highly recoomend this film. If<br />you really looking for a film that has great insight into what made marilyn monroe what she is today nothing short of legendary, This  is for you
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is the best money I've spent on Amazon since I got my Kindle.  I wound up going through it the old-fashioned way (buying Wool 1-5 a la carte) but now I can safely recommend that people just buy the omnibus.  Howey does a great job of immersing you in a completely original universe, accomplishing this mainly through the plot and narrative, rather than through expository pieces.  The greatest payoff of this is you immediately feel that you've been dropped in the middle of a world that has existed for a very long time.<br /><br />The way the various installments are structured is perfect.  It takes some patience as you immediately have dozens of questions fly into your head about how life in the Silo works, but trust that your patience will be rewarded as you learn exactly why, and how, every nook, cranny, and inhabitant of the Silo is completely necessary to everyone else's survival.  Howey has answered almost every question you can come up with, as long as you're willing to come along for the whole ride.<br /><br />I'd love to get into the plotlines of each installment, but to do so would be to ruin the various plot twists and turns that Howey has expertly engineered.  There were at least 3 separate \\"holy crap\\" reveal moments through the 5 parts, which is something that is NOT easy to accomplish through the written word.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Dystopian fiction in general, and especially sci fi from authors like Heinlein, Bradbury, Dick, or Huxley, I am fully confident in saying you will love this book. There's even a fair amount of Frank Herbert in the culture of the silo that Howey has fully fleshed out.<br /><br />I can't wait to get started on the 6th installment.  If you're looking for it, it's a bit tough to find as it's labeled \\"the 6th installment of the Silo series\\" rather than \\"Wool 6\\".  If Amazon at least made it the top result for a \\"Wool 6\\" search, it would make it easier to find.  I'll save you the effort: http://www.amazon.com/First-Shift-Legacy-Series-ebook/dp/B007UAUPZS/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1334592316&sr=1-5<br /><br />Finally, this is one of two self-published ebooks I've read, and I plan to continue to support self-starters like Howey.  (The other was The Old Man And The Wasteland: http://www.amazon.com/The-Old-Man-Wasteland-ebook/dp/B004VGW6VA, which I also really enjoyed).  We've been conditioned to assume that any decent writing has been picked up by publishers, but much like music or film, that's just not the case.  Technology now allows consumers an infinite amount of choice in media, and although the plethora of options can be overwhelming, I can tell you to start right here.  Take a dive into the Silo with Hugh Howey and you'll learn that not every good piece of fiction has a publisher's logo on it.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Everything was how it was promise.  In package, unopened, and the show is great!  Would buy from them again.  Looking forward to doing business with them when the next season comes out.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|Classy and oh-so-proper in every way imaginable, \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" tells the story of Colin Clark, a self-described \\"nobody\\" who met Marilyn Monroe when she travelled to England to shoot \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" with Laurence Olivier. Newcomer Eddie Redmayne is all precocious charm as Colin, Kenneth Branagh chews the scenery as Larry, and Michelle Williams is again exquisite as Marilyn Monroe in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. Judi Dench (as Dame Sybil Thorndike), Dominic Cooper, Emma Watson, and Julia Ormond (as Vivien Leigh) are all strong in supporting roles. The facts of this episode in the lives of Marilyn and Colin seem to be somewhat in dispute, but the \\"what\\" of this film appears to be far less important than the \\"why\\"--Clark's story offers qualitative proof that, as we've heard time and again since Marilyn's premature and tragic death, she simply wanted to be loved and adored. The DVD includes a 20-minute behind-the-scenes/making-of short somewhat misleadingly entitled \\"The Untold Story of an American Icon,\\" which will nonetheless please film geeks (like me) who are interested in knowing about what goes on behind the camera as well as in front of it.
B0000025JT|5.0|It took Barry Gibb from the Bee Gees to finally produce an album worthy of Streisand's talents to start off the Eighties in the right direction.  Barbra reportedly attended a Bee Gee's concert at Dodgers Stadium in late 1979 and decided right then and there that she HAD to have Barry Gibb produce her next album.  Well, it was a stroke of genius and pure luck as Barry and probably the Gibb Bros wrote some of their best work ever for Babs.<br /><br />The album is nearly a confection of pure Pop pleasure.  Barbra SOUNDS like she's having a lot of fun in the recording studio and that quality is carried over in her singing.  You can just FEEL the fun in Streisand's voice.  She's breezy and lite in all her interpretations here, and she sounds better than ever.  Personal faves are \\"Run Wild\\" and \\"Promises\\", two numbers that grow on the listener with each repeated listen.  It's Ear Candy!<br /><br />Otherwise, the two huge songs that anchor this album are the #1 smashes, \\"Guilty\\" and \\"Woman In Love\\".  Actually as the decades have passed, the other Streisand/Gibb duet, \\"What Kind of Fool\\", has quietly overtaken \\"Woman In Love\\" in popularity and airplay from this CD (the other being the title track).  Gibb manages to give almost all the tracks a golden Midas touch.  The two tracks that don't quite work are \\"Life Story\\" and the ending track, \\"Make It Like A Memory\\", which sort of get bogged down by the slow pace and heavy arrangements.<br /><br />Other than that, it's really pure pop confection from Babs.  The songs have dated pretty well as the two duet numbers continue to enjoy regular airplay on lite FM stations.  On a sidenote, I was certain that \\"The Broadway Album\\" later overtook \\"Guilty\\" in album/CD sales, but I guess not according to what most fans have said here.  I'm certainly not surprised judging by the great songwriting, producing and of course, the irreplaceable singing from Babs.  A treasure that stands as one of her finest hours as an artist.
1468179993|5.0|Jeremey Donovan has written  a useful guide on how to create and deliver a specific type of speech--the TED talk. If you have not watched examples of speeches on TED, they're available free on [...], and on YouTube. I recommend doing this, as a preview before reading this book.<br /><br />In short, easy to read segments, Donovan deconstructs the TED talk and helps you create one of your own. Using his training in Toastmasters--an excellent way to train as a speaker, by the way--and his extensive TED research--he makes the TED talk do-able for any speaker who takes the time to create one.  If you want to learn how to inspire audiences in a way that works on a number of levels, a TED talk will do that. Now, read Donovan's book, apply its principles, and you're on your way to the rewards a TED talk can bring.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Marilyn Jess<br />Distinguished Toastmaster
B007NCSQFO|4.0|This new album displays Nicki's multidimensional skill. She can sing, rap, and do both together in an effective and believable way. I enjoyed every song on this new album, just as I did her first album. There are certain times where I feel Nicki rhymes for the sake of rhyming and it doesn't really make much sense or work that well, and she often rhymes the same word with the same word which can be annoying. Nevertheless, this album has something for everybody, and I think that's how Nicki intended it. I don't think she expects everybody to like every song, but she can reach everyone with at least one of the songs on this album, or as is the case with me, with all of them she can entertain and provide a fun song. This album has party-club style songs, great upbeat songs, and also has some that make you take time to think and enjoy soothing melodies.
0345803485|1.0|I really like fanfiction.  I read a lot of it and I think it's awesome.  What I don't think is awesome is someone writing fanfiction, taking characters from someone else, and then publishing it as original work.  While the author went through and changed the names, that doesn't change the personalities and mannerisms that are directly copied from the Twilight series.  Hell, I even saw some VERY similar lines.  While not all of the characters were carbon copies (Edward/Christian) many were nearly the same (Bella (er Ana), her mom, her dad, her best friend, etc).<br /><br />I can't believe this book is so popular.  I'm constantly dumbstruck by what people go nuts over these days.  Twilight was bad enough, with the controlling, slightly abusive vampire boyfriend.  This book doesn't just take that up a notch, it skyrockets the abuse factor.  Christian is in to BDSM, ok.  But he is also a stalker.  He randomly shows up at Ana's house, her mom's, etc.  He flips out if she doesn't e-mail him back instantly and threatens to physically punish her.  He DOES physically punish her on multiple occasions to the point where she is upset and cries.  Sure, he feels bad and apologizes and buys her flowers.  But then he says it's how he is and he can't help himself for it.<br /><br />Is that what women should accept these days?  Should we all accept physical and emotional abuse?  Is being so controlled that we're told what and when to eat, how to dress, what friends we can hang out with, etc all okay?  Should we just accept that if we give a platonic friend a hug, it's acceptable for our boyfriends to roughly drag us out of the room and emotionally abuse us for being so rude as to make them jealous?<br /><br />This book makes me sick.  I'm so revolted by the entire concept that this man is redeemable.  The heroine started out as a normal, happy, well-adjusted female and seeing what this guy does to her is just disgusting.  The cycle of abuse then begging for forgiveness, then abuse again, then forgiveness again never stops.  I'd rather see Bella, I mean Ana, slap him across the face and find some other man that isn't \\"fifty shades of ****ed up.\\"ain, then forgiveness again never stops.  I'd rather see Bella, I mean Ana, slap him across the face and find some other man that isn't \\"fifty shades of ****ed up.\\"

B0061S0A64|2.0|Honestly, the good reviews here have to be fake. Not just because they are good, because they are glowing. I am a looong time musician, this app is okay, it's basically a toy with cheap Toys-r-us sounds. I downloaded because of the great reviews...they now seem completely unauthentic. It's good for 5 minutes of doodling, that's all.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I got schooled this year<br />by<br />a<br />Book.<br />a book that I'm seriously,<br />deeply, madly, incredibly,<br />and undeniably in love<br />with.<br /><br />When a book dominates my Goodreads feed with 5 star ratings, I jump at the chance to see what the hype is about. That is the situation with Slammed by Colleen Hoover. I had no idea who Colleen Hoover was (*hangs head in shame*) and I had no idea what her book was about, but with that many 5 star ratings, what do I have to lose, right?<br /><br />I jumped blindly into this book without even glancing at the synopsis but came out with my eyes wide open (albeit, a little bloodshot from crying.) Slammed is about poetry, love, heartbreak, death, sacrifice, responsibility, The Avett Brothers (had to throw that one in there for you Colleen) and overcoming hurdles that life throws at you. I don't want to attempt a summary of the book for fear that I will give away spoilers, but I will say that it is an emotional journey that you shouldn't dare miss.<br /><br />I give Slammed 5 stars due to the emotional turmoil it put me through, the heartache I felt for the characters, the way that it made me laugh out loud, and the fact that it kept me from sleeping because I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that loves YA and loves to experience an emotional journey.<br /><br />And with that, I am off to Google poetry slams in my area. After reading about them, I kinda want to experience one for myself.<br /><br />(By the way, the opening of my review was an adaptation of a poem from Slammed, giving all the credit to Collen for that one.)
B0018QOIXU|4.0|There is just something special in the character of the voice that takes it beyond a beautiful voice into a compelling voice.  A little twist of the throat or a wisp in the voice box.  Creative and satisfying lyrics and melody that invites repeat listening like a soft kiss that suggests another story to come.

1439102813|5.0|This book was, for me, an excellent description of the Alzheimer's journey.  Having gone through it with my monther & grandmother, I saw so many things that really rang true.  I could understand Alice's feelings... and some of her families.  You can tell a lot of research was done before writing this book.  I think it is a very accurate account of the \\"long good bye\\".
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This is a great little headphone amp.  The price is right for what it does.  It comes with two plastic clips so you can clip this to a backpack/pocket/whatever if you want to keep it tucked away nicely.  It's plastic but feels tough - I don't feel like I need to be fragile with it much.  Main function button works well.  The various pre-configured equalizer settings is a nice bonus.  Sound is very crisp and clear.  Battery life is several days for me, if I remember to turn the unit off after use.<br /><br />There is a 60Hz mains hum that I can hear sometimes through the headphones while the unit is plugged into USB and charging - but off the USB charger there is no hum or distortion.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy.  It makes everything sound much better in my Sennheiser 595s.  I would highly recommend this product to others who may be browsing the reviews (like I did) -  very affordable and quality product.

B005UBNL0A|5.0|I overclocked this baby to 4.2 GHz on an MSI 970a board (also from Amazon) and it will run circles around much more expensive 6- and 8-core processors with lower clock speeds and smaller L2 and L3 cache (split between cores). It runs cool with the stock fan even when overclocked. Will definitely go AMD again.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I liked the book but I can't help but be surprised at how much The Whole World liked the book.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Erin Morgenstern's sophomore effort had better be terrific, because her debut, \\"The Night Circus,\\" sets the bar extremely high.  Harry Potter has influenced how we tell stories about the training of young wizards, but \\"The Night Circus\\" offers us something completely original.<br /><br />The set-up could not be more classic.  Two aging (ageless?) magicians agree to a contest - your pupil against my pupil.  A young boy and girl are thrown into a contest that seemingly lacks rules or even a forum, but it is clear that the stakes are extremely high.  Gradually, the contestants come together in the Night Circus, a legendary circus where perfect enchantment can be found, if only for a few hours, before the circus magically whisks itself off to another destination.<br /><br />Morganstern weaves a dense tale of enchantment and illusion, anchored by love.  Interestingly, she writes in the tense - so the reader is magically transported into the scene with the characters.  This little twist - it is a seemingly small matter to go from, \\"she raised her fingers to his chin\\" to \\"she raises her fingers to his chin\\" - elevates the magic of the circus and the stakes of the contest.<br /><br />While Morganstern gives us great characters, the delights of the book are found in her descriptions of the circus and its wonders - from the all-important clock to the wonders found in the various tents even down to the delightful treats for sale, the circus is a feast for the senses.  Always under control, never overblown, \\"The Night Circus\\" is a magnificent entertainment.  Check it out.

B0060AY6FO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Pride & Prejudice, and in my opinion, it could have been written by Jane herself.  It is certainly well written and in her style.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I have been a Bonnie Raitt fan since 8 tracks! Bonnie does not disappoint her fans. This CD is everything and more for the listener. Her voice is sweet like 'jalapeno jelly on cream cheese' put that on a cracker and it snaps! Another biggie, she has so much variety in rhythm song to song, that you could be endless non stop and still not get tired. LOVE IT!
B0061S0A64|4.0|This is a cute and fairly versatile app. I had to play with it a bit to figure out the controls: the nodes with the plus signs generate beats that are only realized when non-plus nodes are connected to them. The default scale of the keyboard (that your finger and the nodes play) is pentatonic, but you can change it to major, minor, whole tone, or even chromatic. You can also vary the sound quality (waveform, attack, decay, echo), so it's quite rich in possibilities. The one mistake I've found is that the scale called &quot;melodic minor&quot; does indeed have raised 6th and 7th scale degrees, but they are raised all the time, not just when pitches are ascending. That will bother me, so I'll probably avoid that scale. Otherwise, I like the options and think the interface is creative and friendly.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|Home Theater reviews are rating the Picture and Sound of this Blu-Ray Excellent! The photography is so gorgeous and jaw dropping! The last time I recalled an orange sunset so beautiful was Gone With the Wind. 'Hugo' won the academy award for Best Cinematography against this one. Even though 'Hugo' was another great film, War Horse clearly won Best Cinematography in my book! This film really is a big Old Fashioned picture with actual characters that are not cardboard thin! The Sound is very great, the battle scenes take full advantage of all the speakers! The music by John Williams is very moving! It seems that they followed the strategy from E.T. by letting the music score breathe and add the film later! It makes one of the most moving and powerful endings like the end of E.T.! On all technical points: Acting, Photography, Story, Editing, this film is a powerful experience. It is clearly on the top lists of 'Horse' movies! Spielberg is really maturing as a film maker.<br />  I am deeply hurt by the negative reviews I have seen! \\"Dull\\" \\"Boring\\" It proves to me how corrupted the movie going audience has become. I think they should flick their 600 tv channels while they play with their cell phone menus. Meanwhile, the serious people will have a glorious Old Fashioned Cinema experience called 'War Horse'.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|I had been waiting for about five years for Star Wars to be released on Blu Ray, ever since I bought a PS3 and Hi Def 1080 P TV. Unlike older generations of SW fans, I came of age during the 1997 re-re-releases of the original trilogy and the prequels. Comparing the oriignals to the special editions, I prefer, the special editions, but I still very much think, Lucas should have included the original trilogy in this set. Many other movie directors have done this and have done it well. That being said, as an author, who is re-writing the first five books in a series of novels I started writing when I was in middle school, I can understand George's desire to make changes. I can also understand George's feeling that the newly edited versions of the orignal films are superior to their orignal 1977, 1980, 1983 releases. I feel that the re-written upcoming releases of my first five novels are superior to the orignal versions. Still, given how much love fans have for the orignal trilogy, I feel that Lucas needs to throw his fans a bone and include the original releases of Episodes IV- VI. I am one of the few people that feel that Darth Vader's screaming \\"No\\" as Palpatine tries to kill his son Luke is apprpriate for the anguish Vader feels at the prospect of losing the only person alive who beleives in him.<br />The part of the blu-ray set that upsets me the most is the fact that none of the special features from the orignal release of the prequels is included, so there are no bonus features for Episodes I-III. Not only that, but the special features that are on the three discs are inferior to the bonus material that was included on the first DVD release of Episodes IV-VI<br />Still, it is fun to see all of the star wars movie in one set<br />The force is guding this new release, but the Force could have been so much stronger.
B004YAS9M8|3.0|The music - especially the new versions of his works - is great, absolutely great.<br /><br />But the sound quality is horrible, as if you were listening thru a door. How can they...?
B006ZT47O0|5.0|I am smitten with this latest Epica release. I had great expectations for the release, and at first, I was taken back with some of new arrangements and vocal presentations - of course my point of comparison was derived from all of their previous and fantastic works. As I've continued to listen to the album in its entirety, I'm amazed at how much work went into the orchestration, the content, and the messaging / vocal character roles - I love this release. There are so many unique elements and change ups that add multiple dimensions to every song - Band, you did a great job!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book starts out a little slow, but keeps getting more and more exciting as time goes on. Lots of twists and turns, tragedy, romance, mystery.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|This is a shockingly bad adaptation of a classic spy thriller. It's hard to find words to express just what a let down this movie is. The original book (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) is one of John le Carre's best written and most expertly plotted novels, which tells the tale of how Britain's spies discover and then deal with a high-placed Soviet mole. The movie is a double mess, since the lazy script will make little sense to those who haven't read the book and will offend those who have. Characters appear and disappear, mumbling their way through flat dialogue, and little of it makes no sense. Who are these people? What are they trying to achieve? Why are they speaking in code? Why should we care?<br /><br />  The director takes vast and unwise liberties with the script. In the book, the British spies realise they have a problem when an agent goes to Czechoslovakia to make contact with a supposed defector and ends up being shot and injured in a wood at night. This isn't dramatic enough, so the film moves the action to the Hungarian capital Budapest (which is pronounced BudapeSHt, not Budapest, by the way, the researchers could and should have figured that one out), and the agent is shot in a botched incident which also kills the young mother of a suckling infant. This is gratuitous violence.<br /><br />  As in the book, the agent takes on a false name and becomes a teacher at a boy's school, where he befriends one particularly unhappy and lonely boy who happens to be a good observer. In the book the friendship deepens, whereas in the film the teacher suddenly turns on the child and tells him to get lost. With about 20 minutes to go the movie disintegrates into incoherence and you have the impression that the director just threw scenes together without bothering to see if they made sense. He invents a Christmas party for the British spies where they drunkenly sing the Soviet anthem, and then an agent on the run makes a confused appearance, and there's a search for crucial documents, and the mole is unveiled, and this all unfolds with about as much drama and tension as the monthly meeting of a knitting club. We don't care about the characters and we don't care about the storyline.<br /><br />  In short, this is a disaster. Stick to the book and the BBC series starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  It can stump you. But it also has hints if you get stuck.  Also has a lot of variety.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|[No Spoilers] If you were thirsting after a satisfying and riveting finale to the Hunger Games trilogy with Mockingjay, then be prepared to continue to go hungry. Quite frankly, in this third book, Ms. Collins is the one who appears to have been brainwashed and made to forget the true essence of her first books and painfully abandon the characters she made us fall in love with. Our beloved heroine, Katniss, was demoted to a frail victim of her circumstances. What made Hunger Games so great was it's consistent theme that although Katniss was a pawn and a victim of a totalitarian government, her intuitiveness and innate sense of justice always lead her to rise above it all. She was able to win, against all odds, and that's why all of Panem, along with us readers, rallied behind her. So it was a natural expectation that in Mockingjay those qualities would be further explored and lead her to rise even more, to gain confidence in her gift for knowing the right thing to do and to grow as a character. Instead she is made into a kill-joy and not only her but ALL of the other characters as well, the exception being Finnick and really the only reason this rating earned 2 stars and not one.<br /><br />I think the positive reviewers have rebutted that the Mockingjay was true to the reality of what happens to those exposed to War but have they forgotten that the Hunger Games was fake? It was a made up fantasy world and therefore the third installment of the trilogy did not HAVE to realistically depict the emotional consequences of a war-ravaged soul. Did Ms. Collins forget her audience was \\"Young Adult\\"? That means preteens, teens and adults willing to be whisked away into a world of fantasy, justice and young love. Perhaps some silly focus group along the way told her to write Book 3 to the Video Game addicted 13 year old boy and just blow up everything in sight...they don't really want to read about friendships, relationships, or rich characters with clever voices, make sure to write about weapons a lot!!<br /><br />Another one of Ms. Collin's failures of Mockingjay was the constant repetitiveness throughout. Catching Fire fell victim to this also but by Mockingjay, it was ridiculous. Exactly how many times did the author make use of the Copy and Paste commands because just so many details of the book were ones that had already been explained numerous times before. I practically have the words to the silly Hanging Tree song memorized! If your readers are loyal then they don't need to be told again and again basics about the world of the Hunger Games. A little echoing and reflection is acceptable but when the reader finds themselves skipping over lines to get back on track with the storyline then you have failed.<br /><br />Mockingjay was also a joke when it came to the \\"Reality TV\\" spin on things. In Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I bought the whole Reality-TV-to-the-Extreme storyline completely but in Mockingjay when a full on war is being waged, giving so much of the story to the behind the scenes camera nonsense seemed to actually be mocking the original book. I couldn't take the war seriously since I was trying to be convinced that Katniss was now a pseudo-actress! I'd sooner believe taking Paris Hilton and making her the face of Occupy Wall Street! It was soooo contrived, it actually made me winch while reading and it was more annoying that the cameras were such a star of the book well until the end.<br /><br />[SPOILERS AHEAD]<br />Mockingjay Character fails:<br /><br />Katniss - as I mentioned above we fell in love with Katniss for a reason. We were given and inside view of how her mind worked, how she intuitively was able to survive based on her hunter's instincts that kept her one step ahead of the enemy. She was gutsy, beautiful yet humble. The Mockingjay version of Katniss made her wimpy, very self-absorbed with little regard for those she cared about and a whiny victim, to boot! Who'd want to be friends with her? Why not allow her to mature, time could have passed another year or two when an 18-19 yr old is truly coming to know themselves. Katniss could have realized that she really was capable of being a leader, she could have had more drive and instinct to successfully lead the rebels. Instead she was basically either a hospital patient, a depressed recluse, a failed actress or a Rambo warrior. Completely inconsistent with the Katniss we knew from Hunger Games. I miss the real Katniss and was annoyed at how she was changed so drastically in Mockingjay.<br /><br />Gale - Gale was never given a fair shot in any of the books. I fully expected Catching Fire to explore the Gale/Katniss relationship, and then Book 3 to have us on edge about the love triangle. Instead Gale was left in the peripheral of the entirety of the Hunger Games and only allowed to swoop in and save Katniss or her family from peril whenever Katniss failed or was unable to do it herself. Catching Fire hinted at their underlying love for each other but by Mockingjay it fizzled and no...it didn't \\"catch fire!\\" The poor guy was made into nothing more than a gun-slinging war strategist in Mockingjay. I guess he was smart though when he said \\"Katniss will choose whoever she thinks she can't survive without.\\" By then I think we all agreed with the spitefulness in that statement.<br /><br />Peeta - Poor guy, always the softy, always the gentleman, always the one willing to be the martyr. And yet the sweet gallant painter was turned into a tortured killing mutt! Really? For the last two books the author has been hinting at how he's willing to die for Katniss...like what a million times? So why not let him just plain DIE for Katniss?!?! Let him be the ultimate hero, not turn him into a mess of a person that just gets to fade away into the sunset baking and holding onto his mind for dear life! That's no life.<br /><br />Prim - I was happy to see Prim mature a bit, we did get to experience who Prim was a little, for a very briefmoment. And we did get to dream for a happy future for her without Hunger Games but then I hope you didn't blink because you may have missed the part where she gets blown into smithereens! That's it, nice knowing you! The author seems to have forgotten what Prim represented in Book 1 - she was the hope, the future, she was the one to protect, to fight for...she represented all of the children of Panem who were victims of the Hunger Games. If the point of the trilogy was to put an end to the Hunger Games then why, oh why, end it with killing off the one character that represented freedom from the Hunger Games! Killing off Prim now made everything else that Katniss ever did pointless. If she couldn't save Prim then what was the point?<br /><br />Katniss's Mom - Hello? Mom, are you there? She was in Book 3, right? Hmmm, I think the author kind of forgot about her. Oh well, who needs a mother when District 3 has a new nurse instead?<br /><br />Haymitch - Who would have wanted to see this brilliant but weak mentor and mastermind grow out of his dependency to the bottle and to have him had played a pivotal role as a political leader of the rebellion? Wouldn't it have been nice to see Haymitch's smarts be put to good use. Instead he too takes a backseat to the convoluted storyline of Mockingjay and also gets to fade away pointlessly into nothing, no longer anybody's mentor and basically with a lot more reasons to drink himself into oblivion!<br /><br />President Snow - Exactly what made him so evil? We never get to find out. Do we get to experience revenge for all of the treacherous acts he's done to the people of Panem? Well I guess if you count sitting him in a pretty garden and then watching him cough himself to death..or was he stepped on to death?...anyway, if you think that is satisfying vengeance then yep, I guess it counts! Bad, bad conclusion to this character, such a let down.<br /><br />President Coin - I kept picturing Hilary Clinton for some reason or maybe Isimply had to invent my own character version of her because there was so little to go on from the book. Kind of pointless character really. I expected the leader of District 13 to be someone respectable, honorable, not just a me-too President Snow. Why introduce another unlikeable enemy, we already had Snow and even he was underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finnick - I left my favorite for last, yes the only ray of sunshine in Mockingjay was Finnick. He was the Rue of Mockingjay, the one that helped Katniss and he had an interesting backstory. He was the one you rooted for to find love and hoped for recompense for what he suffered at the mercy of Snow. He was a true friend and the only character to be somewhat developed from the previous book but alas, he was not given a graceful demise like Rue. Nope, bring in the lizard mutts and quick before the reader realizes it make sure he just gets pinched off! Can I say the word \\"pointless\\" again?! I had to reread it and then I just kept asking \\"what?\\" over and over.<br /><br />52 Leegs Dead and Gone - yep that was basically the name for all of the other miscellaneous characters in this book. Boogs, Pularch,the camera guys, the other sharp shooters, the shrink, the other victors. Really nothing but collateral damage, both of the war and of this book! To think the real character development we could have experienced if we weren't caught up in keeping track of Who's Who of District 13!<br /><br />It's just a shame that readers were so invested in the Hunger Games. You had us, Ms. Collins, and yet after we bought all three of your books your finale did nothing but made us feel like we too were at the mercy of the Capitol. Now I know what it's like to be a pawn of the Hunger Games. You used the Mockingjay as a propaganda for the sale of your books rather than committing to your art.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|Splashtop is amazing. It was super easy to set up on my phone and my computer. It only took about 15 minutes. The only problem I have is that if your screen is small on your phone it is kinda hard to push the right buttons. Also, if going over your cell phones network be paitent because letency is a factor. It is still an awesome product and I approve.
B001POX73C|2.0|I did finish this book but only because was sick and in bed. It does not have any real storyline. I do like to read historical books but I am not a big fan of romance. This was more meddling a bickering than I can usualy bear. I would definitely not recommend this book to any of my friends. Deleted from my kindle.

B005Z271Y6|2.0|Don't. waste your money on the Blue Ray. The sound quality was a huge let down. Sounds like stereo, not state of the art 5.1<br />Way too much filming of the audience. It's. also hard to understand what Adele is saying when she talks between songs.<br />She's. a great singer and we all love her music. It's. too bad the audio and video was butchered by the producer.
0452289963|5.0|I have heard people I know who are not avid readers say that this book was 'too intellectual' for them.  They have said that they were disappointed by how difficult the book was to read, and that they did not enjoy the fact that so often they had to stop and 'think' about what Tolle was trying to bring across to his readers.  And when I hear others say things like that, I always smile because it is because of all those reasons why I loved reading A New Earth.<br />This book is precious gold for anyone looking to truly master their own realities, their feelings, and their minds.  Tolle dissects the ego and helps his readers accept this part of ourselves so that we are able to transcend it and move beyond the wounds of our past.<br />Again, what I love about self help authors is their gentle ability to help those of us who are in seek of greater awareness, learn to let go of what is as well as of what has been so that we can all one day have more fulfilling lives.<br />Of course buy this book!!! Namaste...<br />[[ASIN:0452289963 A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)]]

B003L77G06|5.0|The first season of Modern Family was hilarious. Sometimes one worries if the humor will continue into the second season. The writers for this sitcom have not let us down - they continue to write funny plots, many of which also have morals or other take home messages. I applaud the producers of this sitcom for what they are doing to bring good humor and family values back into the home.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I have read all of the Fire & Ice series, and purchased the HBO series for my husband.  His little brother was over while on break from college, and they managed to watch the entire series in two days.  I thought the series stayed pretty true to the books, without confusing anyone who may have not read the books in advance.  Overall, I thought it was a great series, I just hope that George RR Martin can finish the series before HBO runs out of material.

B00466HN6S|5.0|Great family movie.  I was worried about the PG rating but there are only a few inappropriate words...however...on the very light side of inappropriate.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Something my kids 2, 4 & 6 can watch over and over again.  Kids really enjoyed the music!  Enjoyed it just as much, if not more, than the Santa Claus classics!  Great to have a new holiday family movie that is enjoyed by all!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|You can read all of my reviews at [...]<br /><br />School is supposed to be a safe place for kids to go, a place where they can be themselves and better themselves.  But high school is anything but a safe-haven, high school is scary, high school is mean, high school is a bully. Thirteen Reasons why is the story of the events that led up to high school junior Hannah Baker taking her life.  Hannah didn't feel like she could be herself anywhere she went, school was cruel to her and her sense of well-being at home was compromised by a creepy fellow student.  Even her own thoughts were put out in the open without her approval and ridiculed relentlessly right in front of her.<br /><br />Jay Asher presented a very unique writing style with this novel.  We get the narrative of Hannah through the tapes, but we experience it as Clay Jensen, one of the reasons on Hannah's list.  This style worked so well, it flowed perfectly and both perspectives were excellently written.  I felt terrible for Hannah, I read a lot of people who wrote that Hannah's reason's weren't good enough and at that I laugh.  Everyone handles situations differently and I feel for a junior just entering high school she went through way too much. I also  felt a connection to Clay, even though he didn't exactly fit on the list with all the others he played a pretty significant part in Hannah's story.  I believed the roller coaster of emotions he went on while listening to her tapes and I empathised with his reactions.  There are a lot of characters weaved into this story (a bakers dozen to be exact) and they all fit so well.  I hated most of them, as they all came across as pretty damn selfish, but that was the point right?<br /><br />This is an important story that has a great meaning.  This story is about stepping back and realising how our actions affect those around us (in high school that never happens, it's a very self absorbed place.) It's also about seeing those around us, and really seeing them, paying attention to their emotions and caring enough to show it.  For me, a very significant part of Thirteen Reasons Why was when the guy working at Rosie's diner gave Clay his milkshake for free.  He saw someone having a hard time, he knew Clay was going through something heavy and he wanted to help out in any way he could, no matter how small the motion was.  He wanted to let Clay know that someone cared, there are so many people in this book who should have done just that, showed that they gave a damn.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is a touching story that I will definitely be recommending to anyone looking for an alluring read.otions and caring enough to show it.

B004EQAVHI|1.0|I had high hopes for this film which I take full blame for.  I'm not going to spoil it because at the end of the day its just my opinion.  The movie started off swell, seemed interested but quickly took a nose dive into the abyss of \\"what the?!?!?!\\" I think it was poorly executed and as a matter of fact, if I could execute this flick and put it to rest, I would!<br /><br />THUMBS DOWN!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a veryl fun game.  Thank you to the previous posters on how to exit the game.  I wasn't going to let that stop me from playing.  I am having another problem, I have one friend and when I try to visit it says I need to exit and update the game so I can't visit her.  I hope they fix this soon.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Most people will complain that it doesn't sound Bruce like.  Thats true... to an extent.  Some of the songs have a \\"folk\\" sound.  But if you listen to the lyrics... its still the boss.  Different but still great.<br /><br />Bruce has been producing quailty albums for almost 40 years.  Think about that, this album was released 39 years after he released Greetings form Asbury Park, NJ.  Thats an amazing feat.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Tutorial is integrated into the beginning levels, making learning the game very easy. Winning each level in the minimum number of moves becomes increasingly more difficult but hints that are earned in the beginning levels can be used to help. Each level may be repeated unlimited times without penalty. Animations are smooth and very pleasing to look at.<br /><br />Undo starts the level from the beginning and one hint provides a guide through the entire level. It would be nice to have the option to undo just one move and get the hints one move at a time rather than all or nothing the way it is now. Gameplay is very relaxed so it might not be very interesting to those who like fast-paced games. Suited me just fine.

B006GH6IS4|5.0|It's really tough to find a band with more natural talent than Queen.  All four members had their own significant contributions, which is evident by watching this film.  The story of how the band came together was great, but how they persevered was even more impressive.  The scenes talking about Freddie's last days were heart wrenching and inspiring to say the least.  Having been to over 250 concerts in my life, I consider this band to be the one (above all) that I would go back in time to see if such a thing were possible.  Watching this documentary only proves that I would not have regretted such a decision.
B000002TQV|4.0|in my opinion its not that great of an album usually their other albums keep my on the edge of my seat but this lacks it. that being said the album is worth a listen and has some pretty good songs

B007SSEBCU|1.0|After the first 5-10 minutes into the movie, I was expecting a blockbuster.  Just like the Titanic, the movie opens up with the senile thatcher similar to the old lady Rose we see in the beginning of Titanic.  No one wants to see Rose as an old woman tell a tale about her life in the present (i'd rather ready Thatchers biography....we want to actually experience the trip on the Titanic--the final voyage that leads to its demise and her survival (who cares if Rose is a fictional character)....the point is I was expecting to see more of Thatcher's life (the big moments...actually PLAYED out...)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is very fast. Meaning it don't take forever to finish one thing. I really enjoy it.My husband started playing and pass me in levels in a matter of hours.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|If all you know about Child 44 is the barest outlines of the plot, it's going to sound generic. It's a serial killer novel, one in which children are being targeted by a methodic killer, and the only one who believes that the murderers are the work of a single individual is a cop who's being given pressure from his superiors to drop the case. All of this sounds familiar, but you're missing one ingredient that changes everything, and turns Child 44 into one of the most riveting thrillers I've read in years: the fact that all of this takes place in Stalinist Russia, where even admitting that such an individual could exist would be a crime against the State, one punishable by death. And with that change in setting, everything about the novel changes. Child 44 tells the tale of an officer of the state, one whose devout faith in the system is starting to crumble, a doubt which coincides with his discovery of these child murders. But how to investigate an individual who can't officially exist, according to state dogma? And how to investigate a criminal whose motivations are not understandable for anyone looking at the case in any conventional manner? Child 44 is incredibly well-researched, immersing the reader into an incredibly oppressive world where everyone is informing on everyone else, where no one is above suspicion, and the State is greater than any individual. While the mystery aspect of the novel is never less than riveting, Smith's novel is as gripping for its portrait of a world that many of us will never understand, and his use of the environment gives the serial killer novel an entirely new feel, resulting in a book that feels like nothing else I've ever read. Moreover, here is a novel in which the basic storyline is informed constantly by the world in which it's set, meaning that every event and occurrence that happens feels organic to the tale, rather than feeling like a story that's simply sticking with a formula or going through the motions. All of this comes together to create a book whose whole is far more than the sum of its parts, creating a wholly unique tale that's part history tale, part thriller, part character study, and part police procedural, all combining in a way that feels rich and fresh, even for a seasoned thriller reader like me. An absolute knockout, on every imaginable level.omes together to create a book whose whole is far more than the sum of its parts, creating a wholly unique tale that's part history tale, part thriller, part character study, and part police procedural, all combining in a way that feels rich and fresh, even for a seasoned thriller reader like me.

B0072GPQ72|2.0|There were many serious and even amateurish lapses in cinematography.  The excessive use of artificial lighting throughout the film resulted in many scenes where 2 sets of shadows can be clearly seen in an outdoor setting. Well Spielberg may be the director but it definitely does not show. All in all a disappointing experience.  Expected more attention to important details.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game. The puzzles get harder as you progress through the game, but a few easy ones are thrown in the mix to give you a break.
B006L4MX0Y|2.0|This is no Hunger Games. The idea behind the film may be new at the time the film was shot, but I found the movie thoroughly boring and a complete drag.  Many scenes were typically B-movie slash n gore. The actors can't act and the soundtrack is horrendous.  Well, at least you can get a good laugh reading the English subtitles. Not a keeper; especially not on bluray.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The modern age had me in its grips: iPhone, iPad, iNeverMadeTimeToRead ;) The first book in the Wool series changed my reading outlook.<br /><br />I had recently been gifted a Kindle and stumbled upon Wool 1 while browsing Amazon. I read it in one short sitting and I was immediately hooked. My childhood love of reading was magically rekindled. I quickly borrowed the Ominbus edition via Amazon Prime member's lending library. After a couple of late nights (and groggy days), I finished the Omnibus. The story has occupied my thoughts since that time. Today, I found out the a new story in the Silo (Wool) series is now available. I have already ordered it and am anxiously awaiting some reading time tonight!<br /><br />Considering the impact the series had on me, I plan to support Mr. Howey's writing by ordering a signed copy of the Omnibus. Do yourself a favor and read Wool NOW!

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond brilliantly reveals the fundamental forces of nature that have been driving the evolution of Human civilization for the past 10,000 years. This book addresses the most essential questions about why some cultures have advanced to put a man on the moon, while other cultures remained as hunter-gathers. Just as natural selection and the environment determine the course of biological evolution, the availability/accessibility of resource and geography/climate of the land determines the course of societal evolution. It is only now, in the post industrial age, that Humans have finally begun to mitigate such natural forces.<br />I have personally used Jared Diamond's \\"working theory\\" that is outlined in this book to comprehensively explain the rise and fall of the Islamic Renaissance in just a few pages of text; without having to delve deep into the details of historical events or key characters.<br />Jared Diamond has turned the history of Human civilization (on the macro scale) into a science!
B003B02PEU|5.0|John Grisham has created another great thriller, complete with his usual<br />humor and sensitivity. It is a good book to curl up with on a wintry day, and will definitely keep you reading and anticipating the next page.<br /><br />If you have not read any of John Grisham's books, I recommend that you<br />try other titles also.<br /><br />Amazon.com is a very good place to get your best sellers.
B007EMU4DU|3.0|I love House and was excited that I could find this episode on amazon when my DVR failed to record it and it was no where to be found on hulu. I got to see it and know what was going on before the next episode aired, but the video quality was terrible and was very distracting all the way through. If this is you're only way of seeing something you really wanna see, I say go for it, but if you have another way to view it, I'd stick with that method.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this app its perfect wish there were more games like this it had a flaw in the beginning but after the game loaded it ran perfectly 1 more thing when u first open it there a 15 sec no progress freeze but besides that this game is fun n perfect thank u gameloft
B004FRX0MY|4.0|App works very well, syncs with cloud drive to bring your whole library. However.... When I download the music to my device, the order gets reversed. The last track becomes track 1 and vice-versa
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Wow.<br /><br />First of all let me say that I am not a fan of Twilight and it's ilk which may at least partially explain why I have such loathing for this book.  Secondly, if you want to read a romance with actual substance and intelligent research you should seek out books authored by Diane Gabaldon.<br /><br />I find the premise weak.  Enough reviews here give you a synopsis so I'll spare both of us from that.  The heroine, while intellectual, is described by other characters as brave, heroic, a lioness, etc.  I found her to be an irritating whiny woman unable to make up her mind.<br /><br />The leading man (if you will) is at first abrasive and unlikeable but as we progress his tender underbelly is revealed.<br /><br />Please.<br /><br />He's supposed to be a vampire.  VAMPIRE.  When did modern writers decide that vampires should be the equivalent of a bad date with Mr. Sensitive in a pullover?  I'm sorry, that just doesn't do it for me.  Vampires are strong, amoral, and they ooze sexuality.  They do NOT snivel.  But this one does, oh yes.  He is riddled with guilt and angst over all the bad vampire things he's done in his life.<br /><br />At one point he stalks a deer for over two hours before killing it.  Somebody needs to go to vampire school.<br /><br />The only redeemable characterizations in the book were humans which, I assume, most of us do not pick up a book like this to read about.<br /><br />So why did I read this cover to cover and not chuck it in the trashbin after the first two chapters (which, trust me, is about the time you'll decide whether or not this type of book is your cup of tea - plenty of that here too, cups and cups of it)?<br /><br />I listened to it on audiobook while I did glass production work.  In that environment I'm more lenient with literary materials and tend to give books more time to develop and redeem themselves.  As you can see, at least in my opinion, there was no redemption here.<br /><br />Oh, and don't expect the plot toadvance at all.  This is a planned trilogy so there is an abundance of, shall we say, circular writing?  I would not call them plot twists as they do feel exactly like what they are, the efforts of a writer to take inadequate amounts of material and stretch them tautly over thinly veiled greed.<br /><br />Ah, Ashmole 782.  Somewhere in your alchemical illustrations there is a depiction of an irritated woman throwing an audiobook into the Goodwill pile.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|I bought this hoping that it would work with my \\"New iPad\\" however, it after placing the order found out that Apple released a new adapter this year.<br /><br />I kept the item and sold it to my buddy who has the original iPad and it works well for him.<br /><br />I ended up getting the newest one from Best Buy as the one on Amazon didn't have any reviews yet and didn't want to take the chance of getting a \\"knock off\\" from a 3rd party seller.
B0049KWAVY|5.0|I have over the years purchased countless Carpenters greatest hits compilations & have been quite disappointed over the audio quality .<br />A vocalist like Karen Carpenter has that crystal clarity in her voice & now i can finally hear it on this compilation for the 1st time ever ! . The instrumentation backing is fabulously clear too. The original much cheaper Gold cd release has standard throughfare unremarkable & disappointing audio quality . Upgrade instead to this awesome sonically remastering & you wont be disappointed! Richard Carpenter i hope you read this !
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent little game. Good for killing time and using your brain. I am ready enjoying this. Why do these reviews have to be twenty words? Get the game. It its free and fun.
B006R1T40I|3.0|Why has everyone gone overboard in their appreciation of this album? Her best for years? Well it's her only one for years! Yes, Amazon have it filed under Pop and that's not too much of a stretch of imagination. It opens with a blast and probably the best track, 'Used to Rule the World', followed by two goodies 'Right Down the Line' and 'Million Miles'. There are a couple of decent tracks mixed in with the remaining slow, ordinary, unmemorable weepies and then comes 'Split Decision' an up tempo but awful boxing analogy. I'm a Bonnie fan but there's little here of the calibre and sheer grit of 'Silver Lining' and 'Souls Alike'. Sorry, 3 stars for 4 tracks.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Truly an amazing read.  Couldn't put the books down and for the first time will be reading again.  Was a bit caught off guard when I first starting to read was more than I was expecting but such an amazing story.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I got this the first time it was offered as the FAOTD.  Back then, there were some issues with certain processors not being compatible.  That may, or may not, be the case now, but most likely all current up-to-date hardware should conceivably be compatible.<br /><br />This isn't a 'keyboard'-type musical instrument.  It doesn't 'sample' or do anything like that.  It is more along the lines of a dynamically changing piece of art that generates musical tones and notes. And it really is a fusion of art and sound.  It's beautiful in a simplistic way.<br /><br />Is it intuitive?  For some people, absolutely.  For others, including me, it is as mystifying as magnetic repulsion.  I suggest starting with the \\"ascending scale\\" layout to get a better idea of how it works and how to manipulate it.  Starting here helped me get a feel for playing and experimenting with it.  Even though I don't comprehend it as well as I should, it's still fun for me to play with, and my 5-year-old daughter really has fun with it.<br /><br />This app has more than music generation to offer since it DOES have an interactive part to it: there is a scale board on the app, from top to bottom or side to side, depending on your orientation (you can toggle this on or off); one or more fingers activates the individual bars.  You can also change and adapt the nodes or add or remove them as you see fit.  Additionally, you can change the audio settings to your preference.  Settings include attack and decay, waveform, key and so forth.  Under the settings you can enable shaking to clear the screen or press the button to clear the scree, choose portrait mode or landscape, and even set a sleep timer!<br /><br />Two more features I like are the ability to record your music, and the ability to save your current layout.  That allows for experimentation with little fear of losing your work.  Be forewarned, however, that the one feature that's missing is a selective multiple undo.<br /><br />Since the first FAOTD, the app has undergone some changes.  One of the more interesting changes is the 'gravity' mode, which allows you to turn and tilt your device to affect the notes.  It seems to also have gained a number of 'layouts' which are starting templates for getting started.<br /><br />The developer is very responsive, as I discovered the first time around.  So if you have an idea, suggestion, or an issue, you'll probably be successful in resolution or get the developer's attention for a feature or bug.<br /><br />There are no permissions to worry about except for the internet access.  It uses this, apparently, for its social media and other sharing options.  The app works just fine without internet access, so feel free to block it if it suits you.<br /><br />I can't remember if the price has come down or not; I seem to remember this being priced much higher.  Personally, I think this is worth more than the current asking price.the app has undergone some changes.

0062073281|1.0|I have read all the other LA CAndy series, and was really impressed with the writing style and story lines, and plot also which kept you interested, I was excited to finish one book and see what was going to happen in the next.<br /><br />This was not the case with Fame Game, it seemed a bit of a non-starter to be honest, and seemed to be more of the same, but with no real story line to keep you interested.<br /><br />It felt like it was going through the motions and I was disappointed with it. I hope the next book in the series will redeem what was so good about LA Candy series<br /><br />Sorry Lauren, this book is non-descript and a waste of time!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|If I could rate this game -1 star I would.  That's how obnoxious this game is. Game froze immediately on the fire. Wouldn't pull up any menu to exit. &quot;stuff&quot; button completely locked up screen. I had to power down my kindle to just get back home where I instantly uninstalled this piece of buggy trash.<br /><br />Really Amazon? You cant hire a few live humans to test out these apps on actual devices?!?  Please pull this mess out of the store until it will actually run as intended on Fire! Waste of time.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this games is awesome but it is very similar games so it isn't unique it so it looks like people collied off of you or the people who made them took someone else's work

B006X415GK|5.0|The perfect addition to the Skull Shore collection. This doll has the same amazing attention to detail that all the others have. Frakie looks so cool in the black and white color scheme. Every thing is black or grey, with silver accents. Love the shorter hair on this doll. It's awesome.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I say that with the best of intentions. Thank god Udo decided to stay put with U.D.O. because in doing so Accept were able to move ahead. And AHEAD is where they moved. After the excellent comeback of 'Blood..' this CD takes that one a bit further but has a slightly more memorable edge. The songs stick in your mind a bit better and the riffs are solid as always. The Vocals come across more sincere. I actually think in time I will prefer this one.<br /><br />I will keep it short. Most said what needs to be said. I will just add that the solo's are incredible again. On these last 2 discs, Hoffman has came back a much more focused player, especially in the solo's. Much more feeling in that heavy Schenker-esque style. Really like that about these last 2 releases. To say the band sound rejuvenated would be an extreme understatement. Also the crisp production again makes every note come across clearly without too much of that 'In Your Face', overly loud production that plague many releases by older bands (Exodus, Heathen, Darkane etc.).<br /><br />I think after years of complacency, doing some festivals each year and seeing what the fans wanted and what some newer fans were listening to, the band were able to completely start new when Udo decided to not come back 100%. They may have been more tempted to keep the songwriting a bit more 'nostalgic' sounding if Udo had come back, to appease the base fans more than thinking of gaining new ones. But, they were able to keep all of them and add tons more with 'Blood of the Nations' because I believe to some Udo's voice is an acquired taste (not to mention his small stature on stage), where Mark's voice adds balls and has a bit of that dirty American attitude. Definitely helps their US fan base.. That why Its good because there is not only a great new Accept lineup, but U.D.O. can remain a strong entity as well. Seeing most of his solo stuff is 4 star material. Win/Win.<br /><br />To any who liked the last, just add it to your cart. No problems here. if your new (if thats even possible), just buy it.rt. No problems here. if your new (if thats even possible), just buy it.
0451232577|5.0|Boy, where do I start?<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />I found \\"Fall of Giants\\" to be so rich in history, politics, and information that I was amazed at how much work the author really put into his novel. The last page alone (at least in my book) is dedicated to a list of historians that have helped him get his facts straight and I really appreciate this from the author. Also, the writing style is flawless in the sense that Mr. Follet makes this 1000 page monster really feel more like 500 pages, it is simply THAT good. I also found some rather funny dialogue here and there that always threw me off a bit! Honestly, I've never read a book by Mr. Follet and I'm certainly glad I read this one. Many readers will be harsh with Mr. Follet for depicting the Russians in a harsh manner but, they came out to be my favorite characters in the story line. If you've looked at history, from my point of view, Russians were hardened people by the fact that they will fight and die for what they want, no matter the cost they will get it. It's like they become rabid until they achieve their goal and personally I loved that attitude and was glad to have historically correct information about the Bolshevik movement.<br /><br />Negatvies:<br /><br />I found the negatives rather important but, not important enough to deduct a star or two. First, Id like to address the fact that **SPOILER*** mostly all of the characters end with a happy ending. I'm not an author but somewhere in the middle of the story I wanted a character or two to die off to see how Mr. Follet would weave the effect of the characters death into his story line. Second, it seems the author uses shallow description at times where you could sub a different name into the equation and add adjectives. This wasn't a big deal to me but I figured it to be something worth noting. As you can see, these are very minor flaws that I noticed but are no where near worthy to deduct a star. In fact, I'm not even sure why I listed them =] ENJOY!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is useful. I'm an aspiring writer, and whenever I feel an idea come up, I whip the app out and write whatever comes to mind. I just wish that I could change the email address that it sends my notes to. a minor annoyance, but a solid app altogether.

086571701X|5.0|Best resource of Aquaponics ever!!!!<br /><br />It is not a step by step of an specific aquaponic system, instead it is a complete step by step for any aquaponics systems.  It tells you what to do and what to avoid.  It also explains the ratio between plant qty and fish qty in a balanced system. It is a must have for aquaponic newbies/rookies.<br /><br />This book is easy to read and understand. You dont need to have a phd in biology.<br /><br />If you are trying to build an specific aquaponics system like IBC tote, Barrelponics, NFT or Raft you should read this book first and then get a book or guide for your specific setup. This book is aimed more for personal use but Silvia sometimes give some hints for people doing commercial setups.<br /><br />The only information that this book lacks is more about the plants like: plant spacing, average plant yield in aquaponics and harvest time. But then again this is not a plant book, it is an aquaponic book. Besides, you can easily get this info on the Silvia's web site forum.
0345803485|5.0|Honestly, I don't read much and let me tell you - I couldn't put this book down!  I love that it is an easy-read, the writing flows and you're done with the book before you know it.  An added benefit is how it has spiced up my own sex life; not that it was bad to begin with, but I dare experiment more!  Anyway, in all fairness it is a very good read regardless of some immaturity or frustrations with Anastasia.

044024630X|4.0|I won't repeat the plot summary-- others have done it already. So let's get straight to my opinion: The book is good, but it could have been very good, if the editor had done a proper job of editing out the fluff.<br />When famous authors with a guaranteed public get power over their editors, they often begin to write longer and fluffier. Clancy began writing 400-450 pages, and ended writing 800 pages. J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was her best, and among the shortest. Later on she began to fluff up the book, and no editor dared speak back to her. Apparently the same happened to Lee Child.<br />Don't misunderstand me: His descriptive power is still awesome, but this does not mean he has to describe everything. He can still turn out a page turner book-- which this book occasionally is-- but when I found myself skipping whole parts fight scenes, and of the sex scenes (!), I knew there was a problem here.<br />Now, I myself write (and publish) award-winning books (both non-fiction and fiction-- yes, thrillers), and I have always found Elmore Leonard's dictum (to cut out all the parts the reader skips) a good one. It helps keep the paying bums in the paying seats. Lee Child can still keep them, but I found my own bum over-fidgety at times. I bet others were too.<br />It would have been interesting to get the honest, confidential view of Lee Child's editor about the book. I betcha that he or she would agree that it's too long, but about 20%, perhaps even as much as 25%.<br />But other than that, it's a good page turner-- though it could have been better, if some of the beautiful lard had been peeled off, so more of the book's cheekbones could show to advantage.

B004UXUX7S|4.0|The Descendants is Alexander Payne's first movie since Sideways in 2004.  Much like its predecessor, The Descendants deftly mixes pain and humor with snappy script that won Mr. Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash a best adapted screenplay Oscar.  George Clooney stars as Matt King who is a real estate lawyer in Honolulu and a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  He is the trustee of a family trust that owns 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai that his family is looking to sell before the trust expires.  While this is happening, his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is left in a coma after a boating accident.  He refers to himself as the back-up parent to his two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley).  He now has to step up as a full-time father. After taking Alex home from her private school, she tells him that Elizabeth was having an affair.  This sends Matt's world spiraling even more out of control.  The rest of film deals with Matt trying to find his wife's lover and the selling of the land.  Mr. Clooney shows his versatility as an actor playing Matt as a beaten down man trying to rise to the occasion.  He received a well deserved best actor nomination.  Ms. Woodley is a real find.  She could have played the part as much more of a caricature of a screwed up teen, but she adds real depth to the role.  The scenery as one would expect is gorgeous and the pacing of the film is just right. Let's hope Mr. Payne waits less than seven years before he make another picture.

006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver<br />'''''<br />Lena had escaped into the wilds and was saved by a girl named Raven. She took Lena into the homestead and helped her recover and then, taught her the ways of the wilds. Lena had to learn an entirely new way of living as she learned to let go of her old life. The only guy she had ever been around was Alex, and now, she lived with \\"uncured\\" men, which was a crime outside of the wilds. Being \\"uncured\\" meant that they hadn't received the procedure from the government to eradicate love. When you turned eighteen, you were required to receive the procedure and a match for who you would marry, either soon, or after college. Lena and everyone from the homestead traveled to New York when it got colder, which changed Lena's life even more.<br /><br />I don't know how the author does it, but she is amazing. This book broke my heart, while I clutched it, needing more. I couldn't stop reading it, and when I finished, I was screaming at it. The author has a special talent of ending the book in a way that drives you nuts while contemplating murder to get your hands on the next book in the series. Waiting another year for the next book - not an option. The author has a fantastic way with words that has kept me thinking about the book well after I finished it.<br /><br />I loved Pandemonium just as much as Delirium, if not more, which surprised me. I was scared to read Pandemonium after hearing bits and pieces about the book. I was upset about events that happened, but I still loved it. The book grabbed my heart and held onto it while making me feel all the emotions in the book. To me, that is an amazing book that deserves to be noticed like it is.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the final installment in the series. I really don't know how I'm going to wait a year, but either way, I cannot wait.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked \\"Defending Jacob\\" so much that I immediately got back online and purchased William Landay's two previous books for my Kindle and had myself a weekend reading marathon.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is beautifully written about a subject that can be very uncomfortable - to what extremes will a parent go to in defending their child, whether they believe in the innocence of their child or not.<br /><br />Jacob, 14-years old, is on trial for the murder of a classmate. The story is told by Andy, Jacob's father, who is a DA. I was especially touched by Andy's memories of his wife Laurie, as she was as a young woman when they first met, and as a young mother during the earlier days of their marriage. It was sad to watch Laurie's downward spiral as the trial progressed and as Laurie learned of the history of Andy's past which he had kept a secret from her.<br /><br />There's a nice twist at the end of the story which really makes the reader appreciate Landay's skill as a story teller.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I have never purchased any of Kelly Clarkson's previous CD's.  Aside from listening to her songs as they've been played on the radio, I have never really followed her music.<br /><br />I was standing in line at a local restaurant when a song came on.  I literally found myself dancing in line, while waiting to place my order.  I immediately loved the song.  I didn't know who sang the song, I just remembered the lyrics, \\"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\\"<br /><br />Fast forward a few days later ... I was sitting at my desk when this song came on the radio.  Once again, the positive energy of the song just uplifted my spirits and made me want to dance.  I just loved it.<br /><br />I googled the lyrics and discovered that it was Kelly Clarkson.  Thus, I ordered the CD.<br /><br />This one song is so good that I would have been happy with the purchase if only for that one song.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover that the whole CD is just great.  Great, Great, Great!<br /><br />From beginning to end, from the first to the last, this CD is excellent.  I purchased the Deluxe Edition, and I'm so glad that I did.  There just simply isn't a bad song in the bunch.<br /><br />Great energy, great music, great lyrics.  Now, I'm seriously considering buying all of her previous CD's.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a great learning tool. wonderful for kids to learn the ways of life. lots of fun times.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The most visceral, nonstop, gladly wanton orgy of violence I've ever seen, not to mention one hell of a stylish compilation of influence and homage. Like a cinematic Wanderlei Silva, this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until it's finished, and I love it for that simple-minded dedication to its own nature. Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way. Masterfully orchestrated chaos, it's impossible to turn away from the Bride's classic exaggerated fight scene with the Crazy 88s.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game was fun till major glitches happens goes from resources being minutes and hours to 100 to 150 hours. Too dependent on energy recharge - not enough energy and too long to recharge.
1451673442|5.0|This book is all about Gratitude and it helps you understand the power of your own heart. This book helps you grow, and leads you on a positive path. It was a life changing experience for me. It truly makes you grateful for all the wonderful things in your life, even the most simplest things. The book gives you actual steps to follow which I think is great and very helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone. I would also like to recommend another great read.[[ASIN:1434392058 The Wish Trees]]
0345803485|1.0|Terrible writing.  How did this book get so popular?  It's like a 6th grader wrote it.  By the way, everyone excited for this movie?  guess what?  It was already done in 1986 and its called 9 1/2 weeks.  Again, how did this book get so popular?  Theyve been writing this crap for years...Fabio used to be on the cover...remember?  Total waste of my money!
B0060Q962Q|4.0|Pretty straight forward if you like the boxed game.  AI provides a decent challenge. Nice option for when you have just a short amount of time to kill.
B0043URV5U|2.0|I am not as big a fan as some here, but Bob Seger is a perfect example of an artist where every compilation released is incomplete. No respect is given to fans, when favourite hits are missing. Where is EVEN NOW for example? I actually think most of his songs sound the same, so it's not a big deal. EVEN NOW sounds so much like the track he did for Beverley Hills Cop that it doesn't matter. And Against the Wind sounds like Fire Lake ... see my point? Bob Seger is quite boring and predictable when you think of it.  This album is best left off your purchase list.
B00005JMUA|4.0|A much slower, more suspensefully contemplative take on the same material as its first chapter. Rather than being on a non-stop offensive, this time we see the Bride in a more reactive role as her kills don't always go so swimmingly. Along the way, we catch a glimpse at her training in a stereotypically isolated Japanese temple, alongside an impishly charismatic bearded master, the show-stealing Pai Mei. When it comes time for the inevitable showdown with Bill himself, Tarantino plays his trump card and leaves a driven audience (and vengeful bride) confused about the apparent simplicity of their quest of the last four-plus hours. It's not as instantly captivating as the first package, and a few segments fall curiously flat, but it's enjoyable in surprising new ways and provides the closure we were all so desperate for. It's a perfectly appropriate finale, if not the one I may have been expecting.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|When I try to complete a project I don't have enough energy, so when I'm doing a project I cant complete it and then sometimes I hove to wait until the next day tl complete it because then my energy is full. plus I don't have any of the dollar things to buy energy. Overall the game is great and I would definitely recommend to someone.
0307352145|5.0|This book keeps the reader engaged through every page. This is a serious research book, it never bores, there is so much going on it is hard to put down. There is a wonderful section on how to take care and nurture an introverted child, which can be a challenge since most of society is geared towards extroverts. There is no doubt this is one powerful read!!! I highly recommend it!! Another book I highly recommend is [[ASIN:1453746633 Startup from the Ground Up: Practical Insights for Transforming an Idea into a Business]]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is way better than the old Oregon trail. it is an exciting way to spend a slow evening. building your own little kindle empire.

B00004RITP|5.0|I happen to prefer Rattle's Bournemouth performance over the Berlin but that is not the point of this review. I am an advocate for the 10th symphony and Cooke's performing version in general. I'm of the belief that Mahler took a wrong turn in midlife which led to works starting with the Sym 5 up to Sym 8 alternately lachrymose, histrionic and saccharine. Consider the difference between the theatrical hammer blows of the Sym 6 and the dark thud of the drum in the fireman's funeral procession (as described by Mahler) in the !0th. In my opinion Mahler got back on track with Sym 9 and Das Lied von der Erde. Sym 10 continued in that same line. Mahler's early death was not only a personal tragedy but artistically cut short a wonderful renewal.  He composed much more directly whether sardonic or heartfelt.<br /><br />Although Cooke's orchestration of the 10th has been criticized, listen to the orchestration of the last movement in the Sym 9 or that of Das Lied von der Erde. They are far sparer than the preceding symphonies and orchestral songs. I may be a minority but I don't believe Mahler would have \\"thickened\\" the harmonies much more than what Cooke did although he of course would have been more inventive in counterpoint and secondary figurations. Again for the hesitant find a version of the 10th that works for you because it is Mahler.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|But it was GOOD!  Like other people I wasn't too happy about Hollywood making another movie from a tv show and totally ruining it.  But they did a great job.  They did not try to copy 21 Jump Street at all, instead it was updated.  When Hill & Channing get asked to the program, they are told that they're restarting up an old program.  So they're not trying to be the tv show.<br /><br />I was absolutely amazed at how funny Channing was.  And the movie had me laughing nearly the whole time.  I can't wait to get my hands on the dvd just to see the extras and if Channing, Hill and people who had to act opposite them could keep straight faces.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|yo. go to controls in da kindel and go to more, then delete restriontions and turn it on, but you have to great a coad and DONT LOSE IT. Then set on. it'll remove da WiFi allthough. P.S if you lose da calf, your will have to erase everything.  LOVE DA GAME.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Really struggled to put it down! Loved the story line and characters, I've never read any Suzanne Collins' books before, but definitely would read more of her books! Definitely worth the buy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game will keep playing the game.  good graphics and understanding what to do.  like the whole family idea.  recommend to my friend's.
1468179993|5.0|I am passionate and interested in public speaking and examples of how to do this well.  This book delivered.  It reinforced the power of questions to engage audiences.  It shows you how to use the word \\"you\\" effectively since many times \\"you statements\\" are seen as aggressive and alienating.  And probably most importantly, this book provided good examples on how a catch phrase spreads ideas further. It demonstrates how a catch phrase generates group thinking, group communication, and ultimately group genius.
B0079KKJ3M|1.0|Sorry to say this, but the DVD is NOT DVD quality.  Far from it. At least the price was low.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys \\"Brothers\\" is an album that will make many new fans of classic rock music for years to come. With their radio hits \\"Howlin' for you\\" and \\"Tighten Up\\" the band became a new sound, and new love for many rock fans when this album was produced. Unfortunately, I should have purchased it when it came out first, but waiting for a cheaper price wasn't a bad idea either! With many albums to come, \\"Brothers\\" is just the start of what should be a long career for this band.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a good thing to play. a lot of little kids like it. I loved it so you should get it to.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|The entire season was great to watch. Many unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />You really start to admire some characters and hate others. I never read the books like a lot here, but I love the fantasy genre.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I do not agree with the Amazon reviewer here at all!  Meg Ryan is my favorite actress, and both Meg and Kevin are brilliant in this movie!  Their chemistry, comic timing, mannerisms and Kevin's accent are priceless, along with the hilarious dialogue! The other players are extremely well cast too.  I repeatedly watch this movie and Meg and Kevin never fail to give me a lift.  As a lover of all things French, I enjoy the scenery and the French flavor of the movie... Having been there, it brings back wonderful memories of all of the sights, not to mention the fabulous cheese!  I also recently purchased the soundtrack CD and I love it....
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a really good game for when your bored. I play it all the time. You can even like challenge your friends to beat your score. Some people complain about Open feint but honestly i don't know what it is or what it does... but it doesn't really effect me much so i don't care! :D

0439813786|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this book very much and we all are eager to see if the movie does it justice. The way the book is laid out, with so many of the pages being black & white drawn illustrations, really adds to the excitement of the story. It also helps with the young readers who avoid books that are all text. There's a little sadness at the beginning, so if your youngest readers are sensitive, be ready to give them a little comfort.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Great product, fast service! Absolutely love that movie but had it on VHS. Needed the DVD.  Thanks! Will shop with you again!
B001UW58WW|5.0|We bought this CD in 2010, and we still occasionally listen to the songs. My favorites are Vivaldi's Summer, He's A Pirate, and Smooth Criminal. I really love how he uses violin to render such modern melodies like AC/DC's Thunderstike. With such an awesome instrument like violin, these melodies really come into life with a new and beautiful soundstage.<br /><br />The album art is actually a mini eight pages catalog that has some information about each song and composition. There is a tiny flyer inside which you can use to get/download free stuff like ring tones from David Garrett website, but I've never tried it. If you've listened to the samples in [[ASIN:B002B3D2TU David Garrett (Amazon MP3 Exclusive Version)]] and like his style, you will enjoy every bit of this CD.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fantastic, would definitely recommend. Very cool games and I like the music too. Great way to kill time, and challenging without being frustrating...

B005HET956|4.0|The woman, Kamala (played by Famke Janssen, aka Dr. Jean Grey of the X-Men), is Codependency personified.<br /><br />I really didn't like how Picard let her give away her life into endless sex slavery and overt, unhealthy codependent bondedness, without the hope of escape or even comfort. But it was a good episode, none the less.<br /><br />Letting her go must have been one of the hardest decisions of his life, and he's made quite a lot of hard decisions. The last minute was very great acting.

B005LAJ1O0|1.0|how can you call this entertainment ? Why is it that while we are all locking ourselves away in more and more secure appartments, homes and offices;  blaming the government and the powers that be for their inability to protect us; that we are fearful to even walk the streets due to the extent of  horrific crimes that appear daily in the news reports, that at the same time we applaud garbage like this and call it entertainment ? 1984 the world has gone to hell .
0345803485|5.0|Really great love story. The best I have read in a long time. Don't let the BDSM and the sex scare you away. It's  not raunchy, but rather a wonderful love story. You won't regret reading this story full of action, romance and, yes, sex!

B0079J28NW|5.0|Edit to add:  I guess I should have included the following information when I originally wrote my review: I received a promo HD video excerpt of the project via email.  I did not appreciate the insults I received.<br /><br />I'm really excited about this as Yellow Submarine is a classic piece of animation.  Add to that the music of the greatest rock musicians of all-time, frame by frame restoration, etc and...well it just doesn't get any better than that!<br /><br />Here's my wish list in order for future Beatle's Blu-ray releases...<br /><br />A Hard Day's Night (I own the Canadian version and it leaves a lot to be desired).<br />The Beatle's Anthology.<br />HELP!<br />Let It Be.<br />Magical Mystery Tour.
B007SSDS24|1.0|The namedropping of Timur Bekmambetov (\\"Nightwatch\\") in the trailer is the only reason I gave this a chance. But his name in the credits as producer is the sole trace of his creativity in the film, so don't get reeled in like we did.<br /><br />Yeah, this is a really bad movie, and it's absolutely not worth renting or owning. The effects are workmanlike, but nothing \\"special.\\" The plot is all over the place, and many sequences don't make any sense. You'll find yourself yelling or groaning at the characters' every decision.<br /><br />If you want to see a truly fun, inventive alien invasion flick with a great story, interesting visual effects, and remarkable acting, rent or buy \\"Attack The Block\\" instead of this.

B001E75QH0|4.0|These are the movies we've come to love for the past couple decades (well, three out of four). I've only seen a couple; I got this so I could watch the others and own them all.<br /><br />However, I was appalled at the quality of the packaging. Cheap feeling slim DVD cases where the inserts don't even fit well; one is cracked, and on another the central button that's meant to keep the disc in place broke off at some point before it was taken from the shrink wrap. At least the movies themselves are worth it.
B005URRCUY|5.0|What every rock and roll album should be: hard edges and soft centers.  Nice spare rock sound without all of the modern over-produced fluff.  Easily the best rock album of 2011-early 2012.  Can't recommend it enough.

0345803485|1.0|I am so glad I didn't purchase this book.  It was a loaner.  It reminded me of supermarket trash novels from my junior high school days (I'm heading toward 60), but more sexually graphic with no sensuality or character development.  I kept reading to find out the 'why' to Christian Grey only to get to the end and say WTF!!  I think it was a bad excuse to use paper just write down sex fantasies.  Then to see its a trilogy - how could one stretch this into a trilogy?  Save your money and don't bother.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I do a lot of long term travel 6-7 months at a time, so I kind of feel like a expat. This and the reviews I read moved me to purchase this for my Kindle ($12.99). I enjoyed the feeling of being outside of the country as a expat and the ending made it worth the time. I will not go into the story-line, many other reviews have already done this so I will just rate the book on its elements (0 to 5 being highest):<br /><br />Protagonist Development: 3<br />Antagonist Development: 2<br />Minor Character Development: 2<br />Storyline: 3<br />Setting: 4<br />Theme: 2<br />Writing Style: 3<br />Overall Rating: 3<br />flag

B002GYI9C4|5.0|I've read a couple of Sanderson's other novels and this is by far my favorite. It concentrates mostly on one character, unlike The Eay of Kings, which I think makes it more cohesive. The action and plot are phenomenal. The prose is easy to read. The carefully thought out fantasy world, where the \\"Mistborn\\" can \\"burn\\" metals giving them supernatural powers is well thought out and exciting. The last couple of chapters brings twist upon twist. I loved it!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I think that the first 40 or so pages makes you feel like you are reading something written by a teenager. Once you start getting in to the sex parts-it certainly becomes much more attention getting.  I have mixed emotions about this book--being a woman, I certainly feel that we are being degraded--and certainly don't understand why an intelligent woman like \\"ANNA\\"  seems so weak and submissive.  I hope in the next one--the tables get turned!!!  Why are woman always portrayed as the \\"weaker\\" sex???
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Until roughly a week ago while attending my aunts wedding I knew nothing about Florence + The Machine. It wasn't until the daughter of the groom played some of this album for me did I know. And I must admit I was pretty captivated by the sound of everything right off. But it didn't hit me until actually sitting down and taking the entire album in did I realize how important this album is right now. As far as I could see,we were living in a rather non musical culture at the turn of the new millennium. It's either existed purely for entertainment or as an expression of some variety of angst for the most part. In a sense that's been a positive force: it's allowed the the individual artists to stand out more because there isn't a lot of \\"competition\\",frankly. And that's not a word I enjoy using in reference to music. Lead by singer/songwriter Florence Welch this quartet has done something very important perhaps without even realizing it. And that's free pop music from the NEED to be free.  What they do flows very organically.<br /><br />  What they do now is a little harder to explain. This albums rhythms don't come from a conventional rock n roll standpoint at all. In fact the drums rolls and thuds have a strong world beat fusion quality about them. Melodically this album is just as strong-with a mixture of styles ranging from tribal dance,soul,1980's dance music and baroque pop. Not since Rufus Wainright emerged with his debut in the late 90's have I heard such a big,melodic and diversified whole of music in one album. \\"Only If For A Night\\",\\"What The Water Gave Me\\",\\"Never Let Me Go\\",\\"No Light,No Light\\",\\"Seven Devils\\",\\"All This And Heaven Too\\" and \\"Leave My Body\\" dig right into the bigness their sound provides and doesn't let go. Of course Florence's soulful chant of a vocal instrument almost adds three other musicians alone,metaphorically. These songs are deeply romantic styled poetry-with a lot of spiritual overtones in it's outlook on life,death and speculation on the nature of both.<br /><br />  \\"Shake It Out\\" of course makes the most use of the wildly rhythmic sound of the album. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is one of my favorites with it's orchestral pop sound of Jeff Lynne meets Bruce Springsteen. On \\"Lover To Lover\\" it's out and out uptempo,grooving soul. Again with that big production and musical back round. Another favorite of mine is \\"Spectrum\\",a well produced and lightly electronic 80's style boogie dance/funk type number. Even for that,this is definitely music made by and for human beings. Humans making music. And humans doing so with a strong and deeply passionate personality.  While I've seen people such as Bjork and others strive most of their careers for a sound like this,it's still easy to get lost in eccentricity. Somehow these Londoners manage to avoid that situation by consistently speaking directly AND poetically to those listening to their music. Already with this two albums into their career,Florence + The Machine have a long and very successful musical life ahead of them.he nature of both.<br /><br />  \\"Shake It Out\\" of course makes the most use of the wildly rhythmic sound of the album. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is one of my favorites with it's orchestral pop sound of Jeff Lynne meets Bruce Springsteen. On \\"Lover To Lover\\" it's out and out uptempo,grooving soul. Again with that big production and musical back round.

B007IGG0IA|5.0|Listening after hearing their previous studio set [[ASIN:B005QKYIZ2 Ceremonials]],there was a realization that I'd skimped on MTV's Unplugged series in a lot of cases. The only time I ever got involved in this was picking up Alicia Keys' own excellent [[ASIN:B000B5IPLK Alicia Keys: Mtv Unplugged]]. In fact live albums are generally a very low priority in my collection. Or were until I realized their value. It was clear upon listening to this band that they had the potential to be many different things on stage. One thing they possess is a love of theater. And not in the spectacle/drama queen sense. But the way they emotionally frame and present their music. That sense lends itself wonderfully to live performance when an artist has it. On a level beyond mere performance. Since I haven't heard this bands debut set a few of these songs are unfamiliar. But this was actually the first Florence + The Machine album I considered picking up. It was just released that day and I elected to get it with their previous studio set for my own musical needs. Overall,no regrets.<br /><br />  Basically all that's missing from this is the bigness added to their sound by studio production. It shows you how they really never needed it in the first place. A live orchestra takes the place of the studio here to provide that vast bigness in their sound. Since it opens the same way their previous album did with \\"Only If For A Night\\",that's very appropriate. \\"Drumming Song\\" is gone up mostly with rhythmic acoustic guitar. \\"Cosmic Love\\" as well as \\"Breaking Down\\",\\"Never Let Me Go\\",\\"No Light,No Light\\",\\"What The Water Gave Me\\" and \\"Shake It Out\\" all showcase that bigness via orchestration approach of this album. Florence's vocals are heard as far more overwhelming live. It's surprising she doesn't create a lot of feedback with her passionate vocal....revelries. They also interpret two standards. \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\" is still extremely soulful. But more in a stark piano based Laura Nyro way than Otis Redding's heavily gospel take on it. \\"Jackson finds them in more of a country/rock sound with a male/female duet format.<br /><br />  Even though this isn't a formal third album for Florence + The Machine,it's again another way for them to express their unique and strong talents. Again it's plain to see here they have a strong future. Not only in the studio but on stage as well. As with most live recordings,the visual element isn't there. DVD helps on that level. But the approach of the band and Florence's voice allows the listener to be imaginative and invent a visualization of their own inside their heads. An active imagination that exists outside anything commercially derived seems to be something lost in many art forms these days. And this album gives you plenty of that. It is one of those albums that probably does stretch the unplugged format,which is usually acoustic/folk oriented in nature. Than again all unplugged means is without electricity. And the fact this band had a harpist,already giving them a unique instrumental sound. Here that orchestral sound is bumped up even more of a notch. And they offer a good range of originals from their own catalog and interpretations to make this musically very strong.han Otis Redding's heavily gospel take on it. \\"Jackson finds them in more of a country/rock sound with a male/female duet format.<br /><br />  Even though this isn't a formal third album for Florence + The Machine,it's again another way for them to express their unique and strong talents.

0307593312|2.0|I enjoy reading fiction mixed with a little fantasy, but despite this novel's being described as \\"fast-paced,\\" it most assuredly is not. Its 925 pages drag on and on, with the author describing every detail, when he probably could have made the book exciting by cutting it to 300 pages. Unfortunately, I'm not one to give up on a book midway, so I had to suffer through to the bitter end. My advice is to read the summary, and nothing more, if you want to know what this book is about. I also think the author has a strong fixation on sex. But maybe that will make you want to read it more...?

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have never been a person that has been overly found of musicals.  I'll tell you this up front.  Basically, I could always just take 'em or leave 'em.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I am not immune to the 'songs in my head' phenomena.  Thankfully, for me, this problem has always been fairly rare.  And when it did occur, it never persisted for too long.  That is, at least it used to be this way.  Until I experienced not the 'songs in my head' problem, but rather the 'entire frickin' libretto in my exploding brain' problem.  Two very different things.<br /><br />It all started innocently enough.  Some years ago a \\"friend\\" (I now use that term loosely, as the plot was diabolical and doubtlessly premeditated.  We shall call her \\"Joyce\\".) stated that she had purchased tickets that she was to be unable to use to attend a touring company production of a play that was stopping in Sacramento (California) a city 100 or so miles away from where we both live.  It was a show that I had heard of vaguely - one that I really had no interest in seeing - a musical (wouldn't you just know it?) titled \\"Phantom-of-the-something-or-other\\".<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />I didn't want to go.  Too far.  Too much trouble.  Too much to do.  Not interested.<br /><br />My friend persisted, and as time for the performance drew near I desperately cast about for some acceptable and reasonable excuse that would allow me to gracefully bow out.  There were none forthcoming.  So, on the appointed day, I somewhat reluctantly drove off to the production with low expectations,  knowing the show was long, and hoping that I would not fall asleep whilst it was onstage.<br /><br />After arriving at the venue, and finding my seat, soon the the rock-opera music began to pound, the chandelier began to flash and my eardrums began to thrum.  With alarm, I could begin to feel the persistent tendrils of music seeking purchase in my cranium, and I found myself limp in my seat, unable to fight them off.  I began to suspect that I was surely doomed.<br /><br />But not quite yet: after the overture, a brief reprieve.<br /><br />This traveling production was presented in the Sacramento Convention Center.  As it's name implies, it is not a theatre, but - you guessed it - a convention center auditorium. On the day that I was there (I can't speak for other days when things might have been different) the acoustics were. . . less than spectacular [i. e., incredibly bad] and the show appeared to be poorly miked (or mic'ed, as you prefer).  The result was that I could hear the music fairly well - but I could not understand a single solitary word that was either spoken or sung.  I could see that the mouths of the distant performers were opening and closing, but all I could hear was muffled gibberish.<br /><br />But still, somehow, this phantom thing reached right out to this non-musical-lover and grabbed me tightly by the throat, gave me a quick shake,  and would not let me go.  I could hardly breathe. I was completely gobsmacked, even though I had pretty much no idea what the thing was about, due to my complete inability to understand any of the words.<br /><br />I think when my friend asked me afterward how I had liked it, I just stared at her with a glazed expression.  I knew that something strange and wonderful had just happened to me, but I could not for the life of me figure out exactly what it was.<br /><br />I had absolutely no idea \\"how I had liked it\\".<br /><br />I soon found out, however.  A quick trip onto the internet revealed the complete libretto, and a quick trip to the music store revealed the original cast recording, and with reading and listening the story became startlingly clear.  Within a few weeks I drove to San Francisco to see the resident theatre company of \\"Phantom\\" that was then there.  Twice. And I continued to play the CD incessantly.<br /><br />My brain began to swell, and from time to time gray matter would begin to drip out of my ears.  The entire libretto, stuck unmovable in the depths of my skull, played on and on and on. And on. I thought I might go mad.  Perhaps I did go mad for a time.  Mercifully, after some years (!) it began to quiet, and not too long after that finally it was gone.<br /><br />Freedom at last.  Or so I hoped.<br /><br />Fast forward to October 2011.  I happened to be at my local movie theatre taking in the latest drivel when an ad briefly appeared advertising \\"Phantom\\".  I felt only a minor tickle of interest, supposing it to be some quickie cheesefest, and thought to check it out on the internet when I returned home.  But by the time the drivel had ended, I had totally forgotten about \\"Phantom\\".<br /><br />My bad.  And my regret.<br /><br />Fast forward to March of 2012.  Surfing around for something to DVR one weekend afternoon, I noticed that \\"Phantom\\" was to be presented on my local PBS station.  PBS???  Phantom???  My lip curled in a sneer.  I certainly didn't need to watch THAT ever again.  For some reason I decided to DVR it anyway, sure I would never actually watch it.  Three hours long?  Good grief.  Not for me.<br /><br />Late that evening, wishing for a brief bit of escape before heading for bed, I decided to turn it on.  Just for a few minutes, you understand.  After all, it was late, I had to get up early the next morning, it couldn't possibly be any good, I just needed to unwind for a few minutes.  Smile condescendingly, maybe, at the ridiculousness of it all.<br /><br />And for the next three hours I was totally and completely lost.<br /><br />I have read other reviews that I would like to briefly rebut, before I go on.<br /><br />Basically these other reviewers state that POTO_25 is \\"pretty good, but can never match a live performance\\".  To that I say, with all due respect: \\"Sir! You are very much mistaken!\\"  My three experiences with live POTO were nowhere near the quality of POTO_25.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.<br /><br />The Sacramento performance was as described above.  Flawed, yet the brilliance of the piece still shone through.  On my first visit to POTO at the Curran theatre in San Francisco, they announced that \\"Christine\\" was ill, and that an actress had been flown in from Los Angeles for that evenings performance.  Well, that particular \\"Christine\\" was just fine - unfortunately, the rest of the cast, particularly  the Phantom, sounded like they all had a very bad,  sniffly colds.  On my second visit to the Curran, the  Phantom was suddenly a low baritone, that would fudge on the tenor notes.  I do not say that these performances were bad, because they were not.  They were good.  However, they were somewhat less than wonderful.  And no where close to amazing.<br /><br />Which brings me, finally, again, to the amazement that is POTO_25.<br /><br />After seeing the show previously several times, I knew what to look for as POTO_25 began.  The point that will tell me whether this will be a great and amazing performance, or merely a good and serviceable one.  For me, that point is when I first hear the Phantom's voice, immediately after Christine's \\"Think of Me\\" triumph.  We hear the Phantom softly calling her name.  I have heard this calling when I could not understand the words. I have heard this calling when the Phantom had the sniffles.  I have heard this calling when the Phantom was a low baritone, and should have been a tenor.<br /><br />I had never heard it the way I imagined it could - and should - be sung. Until that moment.  I sat straight up on the couch and threw my clock right out the window: O.  M. G.<br /><br />This is a musical whose implausible story is hung on the thinnest of gossamer threads.  The amazing thing is not that it works - and in the case of POTO_25 it works overwhelmingly and brilliantly well - but that it works at all.  With this show, as it comes to show time, all of the elements are in place:  the costumes, the sets, the music, the effects.<br /><br />It only remains for the actors to give it life.<br /><br />Andthey do here flawlessly.<br /><br />Wendy Ferguson (Carlotta):<br /><br />What a revelation.  The previous Carlotta's I had seen had all seemed to be thrown in as some kind of a diversion, to make time as the other characters were introduced.  I am watching this and suddenly I'm thinking:  What the. . .?  Is Carlotta making eyes at the male ballet dancer?  Indeed she was!<br /><br />And her voice.  Oh my.  Like no Carlotta I have ever heard.  And the wonderful characterization continues throughout the  the show.  What before had always seemed to me to be a throw-away part, is now a full-blooded and critical member of the ensemble.  She is funny.  She is poignant.  She is brave.  She makes one care about what happens to her.  All with wonderful acting and amazing vocals.<br /><br />Hadley Fraser (Raoul):<br /><br />A very different - and welcome - take on the part.  In previous \\"Phantoms\\" Raoul has always seemed to be a bit of a wishy-washy rich boy, with no real backbone.  It never really made sense to me that he falls so instantly in love with Christine.<br /><br />Here he doesn't.<br /><br />Mr. Fraser is telling here a different tale with his acting, maybe not so in love - but worried about his investment.  Watching his facial expressions (and it is glorious to be able to actually see facial expressions!) one notices that he is carefully calculating.  He does not believe - at first - Christine's assertions about her \\"Angel of Music\\".<br /><br />And when she later professes her love for him on the roof of the opera, he seems a bit surprised and even taken aback.  And seems not to be really in love with her at all - but only leading her on in order to get her back inside to the paused performance.<br /><br />After all, he would likely lose his investment in the Opera Populaire should she not return to the performance, and need to refund all of those tickets.  This Raoul is a strong, assertive and calculating man - not a sniveling love-struck boy. I like him!  Wonderful and absorbing tenor vocals.<br /><br />Sierra Boggess (Christine):<br /><br />What can one say of perfection?  Her bravura performance takes ones breath away.  I have never heard this part so well sung before, nor have I ever seen it so well acted, even sitting in the 5th row at the Curran.  Frightened, happy, despairing.  Soprano vocals unmatched, and unmatchable.  Bravo Ms. Boggess!<br /><br />Ramin Karimloo (The Phantom):<br /><br />Well, here we finally come to the crux of it.  The make-or-break performance of the show.  So let me state this up front, without wasting any more time: I have never heard - nor seen acted - a better Phantom, nor do I ever expect to hear - or see acted - one at this level of performance art ever again in my lifetime.<br /><br />Period.<br /><br />The casting of Mr. Karimloo in this part puts a whole different take on the story.  When he first comes onstage, after his offstage vocals, I was very surprised.  I mean, what's this, a young guy?  He is intense, virile, commanding - and seems unstoppable.  And yet, at the proper times, he is also soft, retiring, poignant, and despairing.<br /><br />When he is onstage, there is no one else there.  His youth and vitality completely commands and changes the love triangle of the show.  Always before, the Phantom has generally been played by an older man - that is, a man much older than is Christine.  An older man moves differently and reacts differently.  It is always supposed that a young man (in this case Raoul) will always win the love of the beautiful young woman over the affections of this older man.<br /><br />This time we are not so sure.  With a young Phantom, and particularly with *this* young Phantom, we realize  that he really does have a chance with her.  This adds a dramatic tension that has, until now, been missing.<br /><br />As I have written above, I have seen this show more than once, but at the end of POTO_25 Mr. Karimloo's Phantom  so had me in his grip, and so understanding of his loss, that in the final scene I dissolved into tears.  This had never happened to me before when viewing this show.<br /><br />Vocally, from the lowest baritone notes to the highest tenor, Mr. Karimloo navigates this torturous score with ease, elegance and confidence.  Just when one thinks he can't possibly stretch out a high note or a low note one second longer (even he must finally run out of breath!), he ends with a sweet and extended vibrato.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when he was singing the video would often cut to a reaction shot of Christine.  I didn't want to watch Christine.  I only wanted to look at him.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear what this man does next.<br /><br />BRAVO Mr. Karimloo!!!!<br /><br />[Sidebar:  as I don't follow theatre in general, and musical theatre in particular, Mr. Karimloo's name was unfamiliar to me.  In the interest of  fairness, I decided to Google him, and found a few YouTube interviews.  What I discovered was a very handsome young man, extremely soft-spoken, polite and self-effacing.  Where was the big ego?  Where was the big voice?  There obviously is some mistake here.  Ramin: call me and let's discuss.]  ;-)<br /><br />To conclude, I will say that this will without doubt prove to be the definitive version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" for years to come.  If you want to watch \\"Phantom\\", you really can't do better than this.  It is an asset to any DVD/Blu Ray collection, and a \\"must have\\" for those who love Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece.<br /><br />So, you may be asking, is it over for me now, the Music of the Night?  No.  I don't think it will ever be over again.  At least not for me.<br /><br />There is no more hope of summertime.<br /><br />Because the Phantom of the Opera is HERE: inside my mind.<br /><br />And the music plays on, and on.<br /><br />And on. . .<br /><br />May God have mercy on my soul.they do here flawlessly.<br /><br />Wendy Ferguson (Carlotta):<br /><br />What a revelation.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|With the reviews for the wired controller (which I have) and the wireless one in mind regarding the huge dead zones I tested mine out.<br />Little Big Planet & Gran Turismo 5 both played accurately and the controls are sharp. If it weren't for the feel and button locations I doubt I could tell the difference between an Official Controller and this one.<br />All the buttons work, the controls are accurate even with fine movements of the analog stick.<br />In short I'm not seeing the problems that others are stating they have.<br />Since I've just purchased mine maybe the company has fixed the problem or maybe there is a difference between the wired and wireless versions.<br />I don't know but if you like the Xbox style controllers then pick this one up for your PS3
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. It is not what you would expect from the title. Its about the life of a very successful<br />arms dealer and what he learned about life and people. One of Nickolas Cage's better movies.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Surprisingly a great movie! Looks wonderful on Blu Ray. Also, comes with a standard DVD copy. This is a must own on blu ray!
0345803485|1.0|Honestly - I was angry reading this book.  I'm still angry 2 days later.  I didn't even read many of the reviews on here, and I will probably be repeating what they already said.  Bad writing, stupid plot and it went beyond erotic right on down to demeaning.  I could go on.  Avoid this one, believe me, there are many others out there that are better then this pathetic book.  I would rather watch the Twilight series then read another one of these books (and that says a lot if you know me)  The author could have made this a fun erotic book.  Instead, she wrote a repulsive annoying novel that I could barely finish. Oh, the cliff hanger?  Not so much - I don't care what happens in the next 2, I won't be reading them.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|If you want to see fighting by all means watch this move. The story line, which somewhat exists, is ok but holds little depth.  If you are expecting a movie that has an on going plot this is not it. The storyline wasn't made to evolve you but just tells you what is going on.
B002O3Z50Q|1.0|I dont know why but what i got its nothing like it was described by other customers i just got the regular one disc no special features no stended scenes...nothing, just the movie... im very dissapointed since the only reason why i bought this movie for my boyfriend in the first place was because the reviews said the movie had special features and unseen scenes.................makes me wonder who wrote the reviews if they were real customers or what.
072325804X|5.0|My husband likes to read to our 2.5 year old but is not really familiar with the 'classics' of story telling like those written by Beatrix Potter.<br />While the language is in some regards advance for a 2.5 year old it still has morals that my son can understand and my husband isn't bored with simple stories.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was this book, that really made me appreciate the trilogy. I think Mockingjay would be an excellent read when discussing the idea of revolution and war with anyone (not just young people). Out of all the books in the series, this conveys the strongest message and evokes the most real-world questions. In war, the 'good' and 'bad' side both occupy a shade of grey. Would it have been better to live somewhat in peace under an oppressive regime rather than to live freely at war? Whose cause are political leaders fighting for really? Yes there might be peace after a revolution, but for how long? How long does it take for generations to forget the atrocities of war and then to revert back to the mistakes of their forefathers? Is there a way to ensure that people don't forget? A darker and more serious book compared to the rest.
0553565915|1.0|I've seen Betty Eadie appear on NDE videos, and decided to check out her book.<br /><br />I'm not convinced by her NDE account. There are just too many stories that sound far-fetched and made up.<br /><br />For instance, she says she learned in heaven that \\"spirits can choose to enter their mother's body at any stage of her pregnancy\\". She mentioned one spirit - \\"a brilliant and dynamic spirit\\" - who chose to enter this world (earth) as a mentally handicapped person in order to grow spiritually.<br /><br />Give me a break.<br /><br />Are you honestly telling me that intelligent spirits, who are enjoying the joys of heaven - would come to earth in the form of say, a person with Down Syndrome (who is severely mentally challenged) in order to grow spiritually? That's total hogwash.<br /><br />Betty frequently mentions Jesus, Christ or Satan in the book and quotes many Bible versus that seemingly correlate with what she learned during her visit to heaven. The thing is, many NDE experiencers - of all religious backgrounds, INCLUDING Christians - come back from their NDE saying that their experiences had nothing to do with Jesus or Christ, that they learned there is no such thing as a Christian heaven or hell. They experienced a being who was made up of light and pure love.<br /><br />I'm a believer in NDE's. It's a fascinating field and there are many sincere accounts of people who have had NDE's, but it's also a field that is open to nutjobs, people who can say anything they want and others would believe them.<br /><br />There are simply too many religious or biblical strings attached to this NDE. I just don't buy it.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Grace Bubulka's \\"Beyond this reality\\". It's about Grace's NDE, it's a very sincere and grounded account of her near death experience.

B0049WHNLO|5.0|The 1956 Newport Jazz Festival put Ellington back on top solely because of the 14:56 performance of Diminuendo And Crescendo In Blue (with 27 choruses by Paul Gonsalves on tenor saxophone) and, aided in large part, by a beautiful blonde woman whose dancing inspired the crowd nearly as much as the music. Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the great moments in jazz and a highlight of Ellington's career.<br /><br />To be honest, there are studio segments mixed in with the live performance on this particular album. This is because of technical issues, including Gonsalves playing into the wrong microphone, with yet another mic capturing the audience and their energy. This was rectified in a 1999 reissue. Regardless, this album does capture the moment in all of its magical glory, and when combined with [[ASIN:B0048Y5KPY Duke Ellington And The Buck Clayton All-Stars At Newport]], which captures some other highlights of the same concert, you have a pretty good audio recreation of what transpired. If you are a purist, hard core fan or historian, then you will probably want to purchase this album instead: [[ASIN:B0013DDOCO Ellington At Newport 1956 (Complete)]].
0743497465|4.0|Another fast-paced thriller dealing with the NSA from Dan Brown. I found this novel to be right on par with Digital Fortress and thought that it was a very well-written thriller. From start to finish Deception Point takes the ball and runs with it like any other Dan Brown thriller. I like that the plot moves around in scenery from the Arctic to Washington, DC and a few points in-between keeping the action flowing and the characters moving around instead of being static in one place. The characters are well written and believable and, in this book, Brown has written another very strong female lead character as he also did in Digital Fortress.<br /><br />I don't know why these two novels didn't get the press that the Robert Langdon novels did, perhaps it's because they deal with the NSA instead of having a religious based theme that stirs up controversy. Whatever the reason, if you enjoy Dan Brown's Robert Langdon novels or are just a fan of a good thriller, I'd recommend giving Deception Point a chance.

1400069289|4.0|Why are habits so hard to break?  Why did I just grab that handful of nuts?  The answer, according to recent studies described in Charles Duhigg's \\"The Power of Habit...\\"  is that  habits are programmed through repetition of a \\"cue / routine / reward\\" cycle  into a primitive section of the brain known as the basal ganglia.  The basal ganglia  is distinct from the sections that control memory and other high-level thought, and our capacity to override our habits through higher level thought is limited.  It is possible, however, to \\"reprogram\\" habits, notably by altering the routine while leaving the cue and reward unchanged.<br /><br />Thus ends the very satisfying first third of the book.  Most of the remainder is a based on a much broader definition of the word \\"habit\\" that includes routines, corporate processes, values, and more.  The book uses the \\"cue / routine / reward\\" cycle to explain many of these more broadly-defined habits, though it leaves me wondering whether that cycle really applies in this broader sense.  Starbucks for example is lauded for teaching employees a routine to console an angry customer, and Duhigg  calls that routine a habit.  Perhaps habit is an acceptable word, but not in the sense of the first third of the book; I imagine that a Starbucks employee consoling an angry customer is fully engaging  higher brain functions.  Consoling an an angry customer isn't the same as grabbing a handful of nuts.  There  is a lack of continuity in the way Duhigg uses the term \\"habit\\", and a more transparent approach to this would have helped.<br /><br />The above criticism aside, I found the book engaging and thought-provoking.  I did not have to \\"muscle through\\" any part of it, which is rare for me for non-fiction.  My only decision is now how many stars to dock the book based on my criticism; I will make that decision once I fortify myself with another handful of nuts.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Rarely do I read something cover to cover but these 5 mini books were the exception.  The author does an excellent job of pulling you into a futuristic world while doing an excellent job of developing the characters.  I'm hoping that the author decides to revisit this world with future books because I think she has only scratched the surface with regards to potential.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game. I like the level selector, with a different background / window view for each group of 4 levels. The challenge is in completing each level in the minimum number of moves, which is conveniently noted at the top of each level. Lots of new tricks, traps, and strategies are introduced as you progress. Recommended.

Another review called it \\"masturbatory self-indulgence\\" and I think that sums it up perfectly. I have been listening to the audio version, and if it weren't for being a OK time passer in the car, I would not have the energy or inclination to continue to the end. I am nearly finished and cannot see the story has moved forward at all. You know nothing of your fan base, George Martin.

0375842209|5.0|\\"There was once a strange small man, but there was also a word shaker.\\"<br /><br />I will forever be haunted by the words of The Book Thief. A beautifully written, mesmerizing tale. I was in rapture through every page of Deaths narration. Markus Zusak's unique writing style draws you into the book and keeps you entertained, engulfed and turning the pages as fast as you can read them. To see death not as a single moment, or a point in time - but as a hue of colors, will stay with me. Liesel Meminger is a 9yr old girl surrendered by her mother in Nazi Germany during the time of ration cards & poverty. On the way to the start of what will be her new life, Liesel awakens on a train only to find her brother next to her, dead. This one moment is the catalyst that will define who The Book Thief is. Her first book, stolen from the graveyard of where they bury her brother, \\"The Grave Diggers Handbook\\", also sparks her relationship with Hans Hubermann. Accordion player, Silver eyes. Her Papa. Haunted at night, in her dreams by her brother's death, she is consoled by Papa, who looks for any distraction to calm her fears in the darkest hours of the night. Discovering her stolen book, she asks him to read it to her. Each night this becomes their ritual. A dream, a haunting, rescued by Papa and working through the Grave Diggers Manual. Liesel's desire to know the words, to understand them, sparks her desire to have more of them. And so, The Book Thief is born. This books also introduces you to the cast of characters that makes up Liesel's life on Himmel street. Fierce and loud, Rosa Hubermann, Liesel's Mama. Rudy Steiner (aka Jessie Owens), her best friend and accomplice in thievery. Frau Holtzapfel, Ilsa Hermann the Mayors wife, and one unforgettable character, the one that stood on my heart... Max. Maxi Taxi, the Jewish Fist Fighter, The Standover Man. This book is a testament to the power of words, family, love and friendship and how far you would go to protect the ones you love.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a dear friend, and now I must own it. I must have the words at my disposal whenever I want to remember Liesel's finest book thieving moments. Relive Rudy's run as Jessie Owens, or read about that dusty final kiss. When they are older I want my girls to know how powerful words can really be when spoken out of hatred and fear. How words spoken by the Fuhrer, ruled an entire country.<br /><br />There is a reason I finished reading The Book Thief on the last day of 2011. I want to leave this year behind remembering how important words, love, family and friendship are. In the face of the war we call life, all it takes is one person to plant the seed of friendship, a single word, for something beautiful to be born.<br /><br />\\"The best word shakers are the ones who understand the true power of words.\\".

B0061S0A64|5.0|I'm a music teacher, play multiple instruments, and have produced music, so I'm usually skeptical and disappointed with audio and \\"music\\" apps. However, this is app far exceeded my expectations, with excellent features (many scales, keys, bpm, attack/delay/echo) to keep the musically inclined intrigued. And it's definitely high on the fun scale. Those who are percussion- and rythmically-oriented may particularly enjoy this one. And it's free today, so grab it!

B005NF2UE6|5.0|What are all these comments I've been reading about Nickelback selling out? Are you kidding me? Here and Now is a hard rocker at the very core of what Rock n Roll is supposed to be: a commentary and celebration of humanity. Song by song analyses get in the way of seeing the forest for the trees.<br /><br />From the opening riffs of \\"This Means War\\" Hear and Now rocks hard. What is the subject of the war in the song? Well I don't know, but as a protest song or as a fight in a relationship it works just as well and suggests that going into the fight it's not possible to win. Social commentary or the fallout of a relationship, it doesn't matter, the song is hard hitting and demands philosophical reflection.<br /><br />Bottoms Up? A defiant rocking party drinking song.<br /><br />When We Must Stand Together: On first listen, an average uplifting socially conscious rock ballad with pithy lyrics: \\"When we could feed a starving world With what we throw away But all we serve are empty words That always taste the same.\\" But what makes this song truly brilliant is its construction. From the opening drum beats, this song drives hard and the listener is caught up in the flow because the drum beats so strongly, just like war drums that drive our society or the clock that turns every single day that keeps us moving in our daily routines where we don't pause to reflect or to care on what is really happening in this world. The key to this song are the lyrics<br />\\"The right thing to guide us<br />Is right here inside us<br />No one can divide us<br />When the light is nearly gone<br />But just like a heartbeat<br />The drumbeat carries on...\\"<br />But how many of us listen to what our heart dictates and do what's right when the drums are keeping us moving in our comfortable daily routines? This song screams at us to listen to our hearts and break free of society's drums.<br /><br />Midnight Queen, Gotta Get Me Some, and Everything I Wanna Do are pure, unadulterated songs of attraction, lust, and unabashed sexuality--in the spirit of the very heart of rock n roll, which was from the beginning a euphemism for sex. Everything I Wanna Do and Midnight Queen are so explicit they would probably make your parents blush. That the songs are hard driving and lyrically creative only adds to their brilliance.<br /><br />Lullaby, Holding on to Heaven, Trying Not To Love You and Don't Ever Let It End are standout tracks as mature rock ballads and clearly show that Nickelback are caring and sensitive individuals beneath their hard hitting rocker veneers. Trying Not to Love You, like Someday before it, illustrates that the wrong focus in a relationship is to dwell on the things that create division. If there is attraction, if there is a connection, if there is a spark then energy should be spent focusing on the positives and what it takes to make the relationship work. Every relationship has a silver lining and that is what holds the relationship together. So often people want to get divorced and quit working in their relationships. Nickleback again suggests that path only leads to pain and that by embracing the positives in relationships can conflict be resolved and happiness obtained.<br /><br />Nickleback are adult men with adult wants and needs: sex, intimacy, great times with friends. But they also care about the world they live in and sing about social activism, consciousness, the phoniness in our plastic society--all adult themes. That they can do this on Here and Now with brilliant song construction, passionate and earnest vocal delivery, great guitars and driving drums while steering clear of cheesiness--even on When We Stand Together--is a testament to their brilliance as artists.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is not for everyone.  It is dark and covers some topics that may be difficult for someone.  That being said, I truly enjoyed them.  I especially loved the back and forth banter with the emails.  Christian has a dark soul that is controlling and over bearing, but is brought into the light by Ana.  It is a long and tortorous road getting their relationship there.  The erotica is very hot and makes me wish for someone with that kind of passion. For a man to love a woman with that much heat and desire can be scary, but is sooo hot. Reading how Christian grows as a man and Ana matures into a strong and confident woman made for an enjoyable read.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I agree with others, if you loved 50 shades, you will definitely love this book. I don't want to compare them too much, but they have similarities. Loved all of the characters and the story line. Could not put this book down till it was finished and can't wait for book #2.
0545265355|1.0|This book was awful. It was like reading the latest Star Wars movies...All that hype for that ending... The heroin is an idiot.  And the story becomes predictable. It is not worth the eye strain.

B0011Z51QG|5.0|This is probably my third purchase of this piece of rock perfection, after wearing out the original vinyl and foolishly loaning my CD years ago. I won't spend too much time here talking about the genius that is Prince, and arguments may be made about where this record stands in the rankings of the best. I will say that Prince was never more exciting, commercial and important than he was with his original band, The Revolution, and this album captures that excitement at the very height. Edwardian jackets and jheri-curls was the style, but the music remains timeless.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book...couldn't put it down. I have been recommending it to all my family and friends! I enjoy true historical novels and this fit the bill with Stephen King's great storytelling flair.  Highly recommend:)
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I just love the format and the content of this DVD! I wanted the CD or the DVD, but not both. I love seeing all of Whitney's videos and being able to subtitle the lyrics so I can sing along. I think I will buy the CD as well! R.I.P. Cissy's baby girl!!! God Bless!!!
0307956350|4.0|This was a well-conceived novel, and a fresh approach to the testosterone-laden espionage genre. Kate is a bored stay-at-home mommy abroad with a secret past that she can't quite let go of. Without spoiling it, I have to say that some of the early clues threaded into the plot were pretty obvious and ham-handed, but ultimately forgiveable, because even if your suspicions are aroused, you still don't know what the person in question is up to.<br />I think Pavone could have done a better job of building the friendships among the ex-pat wives, and exploring the intricacies of those bonds formed more out of ennui or loneliness than any real connection. That kind of attention would have made the ending less rushed and confusing.<br /><br />Overall, though, this book was well-written and fun to read. Great for a long plane ride or a lazy vacation afternoon where you have the luxury of just losing yourself in a good yarn.
0312641893|5.0|I'm having a bit of trouble starting this review, because I just can't properly put into words how much I loved this book. Seriously. I was hesitant to get on the bandwagon, so to speak, and read Cinder because I wasn't sure if it was going to deliver on its premise. I mean, Cinderella as a cyborg? Lunar people planning an Earthen invasion? It was almost as if Cinder was tailor-made for me. Which is also why I was even more apprehensive to try it - I didn't want my hopes getting raised so high, only to be left disappointed and frustrated that the book didn't turn out as I expected.<br /><br />Cinder, though? Completely amazing. It absolutely delivered, and I'm hitting myself on the noggin' now for not reading it sooner, and experiencing the awesomeness that is Cinder.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg mechanic (and the best one, at that) living in New Beijing where a new plague called leutomosis is ravaging through its citizens. She is blamed and sent away by her stepmother to become a test subject in finding a cure after her stepsister Peony contracts the disease. But Cinder gets more than she bargained for, and suddenly, Cinder finds the fate of Prince Kai, the citizens of the Eastern Commonwealth, and the rest of the Earthen districts in her hands.<br /><br />So...what exactly did I love about Cinder?<br /><br />Well, to begin with - Cinder. Cinder was a fantastic heroine. I loved how well-developed and complex her character was. She was strong, intelligent, competent, and loyal to those who were loyal to her. She had her flaws as well - she was socially inept (and really, when you're marginalized, abused, and maltreated by your only remaining relatives, well, she could've become much more than socially inept) and almost uncharacteristically meek in front of her stepmother sometimes, but I think those qualities served to make her into an even more well-rounded character. I just love how she never lost sight of what was important. She was persistent and courageous, even at the expense of her safety. She definitely became one of my favourite YA heroines ever.<br /><br />World-building. The world-building in Cinder is admittedly at an introductory level. I believe there's going to be four books in the series, so it makes sense that not all of the backstory or details were presented in the first book. However, the world-building I did see, I absolutely loved. I loved, loved, loved that the novel was set in New Beijing and the East. In so many YA sci-fi or dystopian books I read, it's as if the rest of the world (nevermind the world, heck, the rest of the USA) ceased to exist. No China, no India, no Australia - nothing beyond the good ol' USA. But Cinder is different, and thank goodness for that. I loved how the author gave small glimpses (and okay, they are SMALL, but they're there, nonetheless) of what the world in Cinder's time would've looked like. The USA, Canada, and most of NA and SA amalgamated into one country with several ruling provinces called The American Republic. There was also the European Federation, the African Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and of course, Cinder's own country - the Eastern Commonwealth. Like I mentioned, they're minute details, yes, but the fact that they're mentioned makes my inner international law and political science geek smile.<br /><br />The Romance. I loved how understated the romance was between Cinder and Prince Kai. It was natural and the progression didn't seem forced at all. It didn't feel out of place and it didn't overtake the main premise of the story. It was just the right amount, and for once, I'm looking forward to how the romance between the two characters will develop. I'm glad that the author chose the slow and steady road when it comes to Kai and Cinder, because it makes their interactions so much more meaningful and realistic. No insta-love here, folks, and thank goodness for that.<br /><br />Secondary Characters. Sometimes secondary characters can come off as very stiff and cardboard-like. But not in Cinder. From Cinder's stepsisters to the Prince's advisor - they were all well-developed and thought out. I absolutely loved Iko, Cinder's android! Her quips had me giggling, and I found myself wishing I had my own Iko, too. I also liked that Cinder had at least one ally in her household - Peony. She was gentle and kind, and seeing her fall ill with the plague broke my heart. And of course, there's Kai, the Prince. I enjoyed the chapters from his POV, and I liked that he wasn't brash or overly confident. He had doubts about his ability to lead, and he was apprehensive about taking over the throne. But despite all of that, he had the well-being of his people at heart, and he was willing to make personal sacrifices for the safety and continued existence of his people.<br /><br />Aliens. Well, okay, the people of Luna (the Moon) were technically not aliens as they were ultimately humans who chose to colonize the Moon centuries before the start of the novel. There's not much known about the people of Luna and their Queen yet apart from their ability to wield bioelectricity (though, I'm going to go with Cinder and just call that magic) and use glamours to essentially brainwash and control the minds of those they encounter. I'm hoping, however, the book two changes this and expands more on their culture, world, and \\"magic\\".<br /><br />With that said, what didn't I like about Cinder?<br /><br />I had to think long and hard about this, and really, I think the only thing that I wasn't really a fan of was the Cinderella elements itself. I never really thought I'd ever say that because I'm more than a little bit obsessed about fairy tales and fairy tale retellings, but I think that Cinder could've stand on its own without the fairy tale element. In fact, I would almost wager on to say that Cinder probably would've been better without the Cinderella aspect. It just didn't seem to go with the overall plot of the book, and really only served as a small \\"gimmick\\".<br /><br />Still, Cinder was amazing.

Now. You won't regret it.tiff and cardboard-like. But not in Cinder. From Cinder's stepsisters to the Prince's advisor - they were all well-developed and thought out. I absolutely loved Iko, Cinder's android! Her quips had me giggling, and I found myself wishing I had my own Iko, too. I also liked that Cinder had at least one ally in her household - Peony. She was gentle and kind, and seeing her fall ill with the plague broke my heart. And of course, there's Kai, the Prince. I enjoyed the chapters from his POV, and I liked that he wasn't brash or overly confident. He had doubts about his ability to lead, and he was apprehensive about taking over the throne. But despite all of that, he had the well-being of his people at heart, and he was willing to make personal sacrifices for the safety and continued existence of his people.<br /><br />Aliens. Well, okay, the people of Luna (the Moon) were technically not aliens as they were ultimately humans who chose to colonize the Moon centuries before the start of the novel. There's not much known about the people of Luna and their Queen yet apart from their ability to wield bioelectricity (though, I'm going to go with Cinder and just call that magic) and use glamours to essentially brainwash and control the minds of those they encounter. I'm hoping, however, the book two changes this and expands more on their culture, world, and \\"magic\\".<br /><br />With that said, what didn't I like about Cinder?<br /><br />I had to think long and hard about this, and really, I think the only thing that I wasn't really a fan of was the Cinderella elements itself. I never really thought I'd ever say that because I'm more than a little bit obsessed about fairy tales and fairy tale retellings, but I think that Cinder could've stand on its own without the fairy tale element. In fact, I would almost wager on to say that Cinder probably would've been better without the Cinderella aspect. It just didn't seem to go with the overall plot of the book, and really only served asa small \\"gimmick\\".<br /><br />Still, Cinder was amazing. It was a fantastic mix of mystery, intrigue, and romance wrapped in a cloak of science fiction with elements of a fairy tale we've all come to love and adore.<br /><br />In a nutshell: Get it and read it. Now. You won't regret it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am always grabbing my Droid  or my Kindle Fire to use this app. I am very happy with it.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|It is a good show i like Christa Miller role in here<br />It has the same quality as Scrubs and full of laughs
0345803485|5.0|if you guys love the book...you'll love the movie \\"9 1/2 weeks\\" that i assume it was based on. Mickey rourke did a fantastic job playing \\"christian\\"...
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Sometimes you have no choice but to flow with the story, because it won't let you go. I love reading a book into which I can get so deep, I forget my internal editor exists. I forget anyone who might be in the room with me, I ignore the ring of the phone.<br /><br />When this happens, I don't even realize until I've finished the book how blessed I've been to have become part of that excellent story, to live within the characters, feel their heartbreak, their joy, smell the proverbial roses around them. These stories are rare, but Pride and Prejudice is one of them. I'm sure I've read it dozens of times, and I hope to read it dozens more.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There are so many reviews out there that it is hard to add anything of real value.  I will say that I enjoyed the Hunger Games Trilogy as a whole but didn't absolutely fall in love with it as so many have.  I was totally hooked on the Harry Potter series (even though I am middle-aged) and thought I might have the same reaction here - not so.  I did like them, just didn't become enthralled with them.<br /><br />As others have said, this third book takes a different turn and doesn't revisit the Hunger Games themselves.  The focus is on the revolution that was sparked in earlier books and how Katniss/Peeta/Gale all play roles in the war.  My only real complaint is that I thought the character of Katniss was no longer the strong female character she was in the previous novels.  She becomes much more weak and dependent like so many lead female characters in YA fiction - think Bella in \\"Twilight\\".  The ending seemed appropriate but a bit rushed --- another area where the book lost one star from me.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Good ending to a good series, but the entire series (including this installment) didn't knock my socks off like it did for some folks.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Simple enough and cute. obviously not Mario but fun none-the-less. My kids will find it quite entertaining. Glad for another free app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This third book continues the story well, resolves the relationships, has twists and turns and is an enjoyable, engaging, worthwhile read.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|First off, I didn't read the books. I went to see the movie<br />because a lot of people seemed to think it would be well made.<br />And it is well made, in several ways. CGI and gore are not<br />allowed to detract from the story. Nonetheless this is not<br />what I would call a movie for little kids, no way. It's grim,<br />heart-wrenching at times. This isn't a happy, feel-good movie<br />at all, that isn't what its about. For me, it isn't a \\"heroine\\"<br />movie. But it is the kind of movie where I want to see the next<br />movie. Very much so.<br /><br />I spent a fair amount of time thinking about it after I saw it.<br />Having not read the book, I was free to think about how their<br />society could become as it is. The story became believable to me,<br />in the sense I could extrapolate from our society today, to the<br />future the movie presents.<br /><br />Because the characters live in a much different world than we do,<br />a world different than other fictional worlds, I didn't immediately<br />appreciate them, nor the acting. But the characters, and the acting,<br />became multi-dimensional after I had some time to integrate things.<br /><br />The characters all belong in their world, they have a very personal<br />stake in it, and they are all trying to preserve the values it holds<br />for them personally, whether they are \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys\\",<br />innocent or worldly. They all have hopes, and they all have fears.<br />No one is truly secure, and the ending, although quiet, is very stark.<br />Yet very human also.<br /><br />The movie has a mix of young actors, and middle aged actors, and<br />that mix works superbly, yet subtly, when they have 1-on-1 scenes<br />together. They bring out the best in each other. First impressions<br />fall by the wayside, because these characters are all much more than<br />they seem. They live in a complex world, dangerous for the powerful<br />and powerless alike, and they are all desperately trying to wend their<br />way thru it alive. Several of them are keenly focused on the humanity<br />of the people around them, trying to keep that in the forefront, or<br />at least bring it into view for a few moments in the brief time they<br />have left.<br /><br />I debated giving this 4 stars or 5. I'm often tempted to try making<br />comparisons with other movies, but for Hunger Games, I choose not<br />to do that. I decided on 5 stars, because this movie makes the most<br />of what it has. A thought-provoking story, sufficient budget, a lot<br />of very talented people, and a long enough run-time, 2:20, to present<br />itself as it truly is. A very, very good movie.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Love the game, but there is one change I'd like to see. For each element to show up only once. Or at least to not have the catagories close when a duplicate element is found. Thanks.

I dont know what everyone is complaining about... This series has to be my FAVORITE by far!! It is very sexual but sweet as well, parts are very heart warming and loving. I am deffinatly hoping for it to hit theaters!
B000SXMSJ0|4.0|This is one of my favorite albums. I love jazzy, blues singers. Norah Jones is definitely one of the best I have ever heard. She sings the blues with a soulful, mellow, sultry sound. Don't Know Why, I've Got to See You Again and Nightingale are my favs from the album.
044024630X|2.0|Others have already pointed out the lame errors in this book regarding the Army, ranks, etc. Also, it's clear that Child has no intention of ever having his character evolve at all: Reacher is perfect just the way he is, thank you very much. I read these books for the fun I have finding their mistakes or their serious-face implausibility. In sci-fi readers need to apply suspension of disbelief. In novels such as the ones Child writes, the whole thing must feel realistic, and how realistic is that a Military cop will best Rangers at hand-to-hand fighting (in this novel a colleague of Reacher's does that to 3 Rangers!), or that Reacher in previous novels has defeated marines and Seals? A military policeman! I find it funny, not realistic. I read on to see what else Child will come up with next, since he sees his hero as a matinee idol who does no wrong, loses no fight, and beds the prettiest women, always. If you, as a reader, confront these books in a different way, if you take them seriously, you'll hate them and get angry. I agree with many of the one-star reviewers that this is one of the weakest in the series, but the truth is that they've become a blur in my mind, except for Persuader, which I truly liked in spite of its howlers, and Tripwire, which for me is the worst yet.<br /><br />Two stars for Reacher and Child. Child found a gold mine, so congratulations are in order.

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is a remarkable novel written by one talented author.<br /><br />The novel takes us into the minds of Nick and Amy Dunne. A bright, energtic couple, facing major headwinds. While this may begin like the usual story of a marriage gone bad--it isn't.<br /><br />Not in the least.<br /><br />Written in first person, I had trouble getting into the narrative, but it only lasted the first few chapters. After that, I was hooked. Not only can Gillian Flynn write, she has the ability to mirror things down to the finest detail while never leaving the reader bored.<br /><br />We know Amy through diary entries. Nick as he journals. Nick and Amy are writers--both unemployed. After losing their New York positions, they head back to Nick's hometown in Missouri to care for his dying mother and father.<br /><br />Amy is THE Amy from the Amazing Amy books, written and made famous by her mother and father, Rand and Marybeth Elliot. Amy grew up in New York, spoiled and rich, before meeting Nick and falling in love. Times change, the Amazing Amy books are not so popular. Rand and Marybeth need the money they have in  trust for Amy.<br /><br />Unemployed and broke, Amy and Nick's marrige is falling apart. One year after arriving in Missouri, on Nick and Amy's five-year anniversary, Amy disappears.<br /><br />Is she dead?<br />Kidnapped?<br />Murdered?<br /><br />Each anniversary, Amy leaves written clues for Nick to discover his gift. The notes consist of moments of import over the past year. Nick has always had trouble deciphering the clues, but now, Nick is the primary suspect and he MUST discover the meaning behind the clues she's left.<br /><br />Eventually, even the reader begins to wonder if Nick is guilty.<br /><br />To tell you anything else would ruin the adventure. What I can say is, I couldn't put the book down. Gone Girl never leaves you bored, is expertly written, and engaging. I loved it.<br /><br />Warning: Contains explicit language.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Advanced Reader's Editioned Reader's Edition

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I know next to nothing about Twilight but could totally see how this ripped off the series, so right there that was a huge strike against it. apparently this started off as fanfiction so i'm guessing you can find it somewhere on the internets.<br /><br />i was hoping for some good bdsm fiction, but this is maybe a step above vanilla, it completely mis portrays the lifestyle, but any gripes about how unrealistic everything is from describing super posh *pink* champagne (wth) to the fact that mr grey apparently never needs a refractory period....it's just really really really terrible writing wise.<br /><br />seriously, it's written at maybe a 5th grade lever with occasional instances where the author abuses her thesaurus and ends up making somewhat incomprehensible sentences. But typically she is repeating five phrases over and over again:<br /><br />1) holy f***<br />2) holy c***<br />3) holy s***<br />4) stop biting your lip you know what that does to me<br />5) laters, babe<br /><br />to the point where it goes past funny and just into painfully repetitive. the first three are almost a constant running theme in our narrators internal dialogue which becomes increasingly depressing when you realize she's supposed to be this intellectual who loves literature. the latter two belong to our dashing male lead, but once he came out with \\"laters babe\\" i was just lost in a fit of laughter.<br /><br />so this is sort of like a literary version of Showgirls. It's awful and awkward and trying WAY to hard to be sexy and hardcore and while it fails miserably at all those attempts, it still manages to be kind of enjoyable in what a wreck it is.

0345803485|1.0|I've seen a lot of positive reviews on these here site that compliment this book for being hot and addictive, and I gotta say, I don't see it. To be honest, this book left a bad taste in my mouth. This isn't a story about sexual awakening, as one review put it, it's a story about sexual abuse. Now don't get me wrong, I don't have any problems with BDSM. Anyone who knows me know my lady and I get into all sorts of weird stuff. But Christian Grey isn't you're typical dominant type, he's a sociopath.<br /><br />Ana Steele is the definition of impressionable, and as soon as this dude finds out she hasn't \\"gotten stuff done\\" (if you know what I mean) he takes advantage of her. He basically makes himself indispensable as the sole source of physical pleasure for her, then he backs her into an emotional corner until she agrees to be his submissive. Except rather than letting her be in control like your usual dom/sub pairing, he basically has her sign her life away to him. He creates an environment where the only time she can feel like she has any worth is when she's pleasuring him. This girl should've run for the hills when she had the chance, he's one step away from trussing her up in his red room of pain and turning her into some sorta messed up trophy for his sandstone office.<br /><br />If I had a daughter I'd be pretty freaked out if I found out that she was reading this, no matter how old she was, because it seems like a pretty bad representation of how a safe and positive kinky relationship should work. I do love seeing a mainstream novel depict a girl as sexually forward and I even love the whole kinky representation thing, but I wish the author had gone the extra mile to make it a safe and positive kinky relationship. It's pretty messed up that there are otherwise smart and confident ladies out there wishing they could have their own Christian Grey. I mean Anastasia even talks about how it isn't fair that he uses sex as a weapon. Why don't smart lady readers see this? It sorta makes me sad.<br /><br />Also, what's up with all of this murmuring? I've never murmured this much in my life.is? It sorta makes me sad.<br /><br />Also, what's up with all of this murmuring? I've never murmured this much in my life.
0439023521|5.0|I was so convinced that I wouldn't enjoy this book that it sat on my e-reader for weeks until my daughter brought home a hard copy and literally had to twist my arm to read it. Sci-fi is not usually my favourite genre, and I can probably count on one hand the amount of futuristic novels I have truly enjoyed reading. But Suzanne Collins' \\"Hunger Games\\" totally proved all my prejudices wrong. The story was so well crafted and the characters so engaging that I was hooked from page 1, and had a massive late night read-a-thon until I had finished the whole book, as I could not put it down.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about this book is that Collins has created a futuristic world which bears enough similarities to our own so that I could relate to the things she described without having to put in too much effort. The character Katniss tells about her world without offering too many tedious explanations that would have made the book a chore to read (like many other sci-fi novels) - instead, she takes her dysfunctional world for granted and accepts its injustices and hardships just as we get blind to the faults in our own backyard. This to me added to the feeling of reality to the story rather than trying to find explanations for the reasons why her world was the way it was, as seen through the eyes of a 16-year old girl.<br /><br />To put it very simply, the story itself played out like a cross between Survivor meets Gladiator meets Big Brother, but with much more depth and action and of a much superior calibre. Who has not questioned our ability to watch horrible reality TV images 24/7 whilst eating our dinner? So it was no big stretch to imagine the people of Panem doing just that, on a much larger scale. I especially liked Katniss' and Peeta's ability to remain true to their own moral guidelines throughout the book without appearing to be sickening goodie-two-shoes, or without preaching about right and wrong - let the readers draw their own conclusions. I also liked that there were no defined villains in this story, rather victims of circumstance all trying to stay alive - this again made the story a lot more realistic and believable.<br /><br />To cut a long review short, I loved this book. I can usually tell whether a book truly grabbed me from the feeling of unreality when a phone-call or a visitor interrupts the reading and you surface bleary eyed and disorientated, still under the spell of the imaginary world you have just inhabited. This was such a book, and I thoroughly enjoyed being a spectator in Katniss' world for a while. I am now looking forward to reading the second instalment!liked that there were no defined villains in this story, rather victims of circumstance all trying to stay alive - this again made the story a lot more realistic and believable.<br /><br />To cut a long review short, I loved this book.

0345803485|2.0|I scowl at my Kindle with frustration. Damn my insatiable curiosity about \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" and damn the enthusiasm of the reading public for convincing me that downloading the first three chapters was a worthwhile past time. I should be reading original erotic fiction by the likes of Shayla Black or Roni Loren, two seasoned romance authors who make the scribblings of E.L. James look like an entry out of a teenager's key & lock diary. *I must not let the success of this author convince me that my literary tastes have gone off.* I repeat this to myself like a mantra as I remind myself that I too am a romance writer with something unique to bring to the table. I turn my eyes to the heavens, exasperated with myself for slogging through this thing for a half-hour. At least I didn't pay the entire $10 to read \\"Fifty Shades ...\\" in its loathsomely pedantic entirety. No, I shall save my Kindle money for Andrew Shaffer's witty parody, \\"Fifty Shames of Earl Grey,\\" forthcoming this summer.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I have been reading Edgar Rice Burroughs books for over 60 years. I found John Carter to follow the story line and wonder of the books marvelously. As a kid reading the Barsoom series I would never have hoped (Nor dreamed) that they would have transferred it to film. I am disappointed that Disney failed to market this properly. I mean for crying out loud the title alone would scare off anybody not familiar with the series. They should have used some reference to John Carter \\"Of Mars\\" rather than the bland \\"John Carter\\". The only people that would understand the marketing as it stood would be old (or new) fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs. We at least had a clue. Sadly this probably means no sequels to a marvelous adaptation. I hope that I am wrong, but the so called critics raked this over the coals so badly, I don't know if it can recover.<br /><br />I don't usually like the new movies being released too much gratuitous violence and graphic sex, that it takes away the enjoyment of going to the movies anymore. This was a very nice exception and I plan on purchasing it in Blu-ray once released. Go see it with your kids, grandkids, friends and significant others you won't be disappointed.
1439102813|5.0|This was the book chosen for our bookclub this month and I had every intension not to read it.  My FIL has Alzheimer's Disease and it's just so sad to watch a brilliant wonderful man become a victim of this awful disease.  I'm not sure why but I did download it the other night and I'm so glad I did.  The book is beautifully written and completely captured my attention and emotions.  Other reviewers were correct saying you will need lots of tissues!  It is a true tear jerker but definitely worth the read.

006197806X|5.0|It took me a while to pick this one up, but once I did I could not put it down. A lot of times - more often than not - the second book in a trilogy can be little more than a 'filler'. Nothing could be further than the truth in this book. It's well-written, fast-paced and has well-developed characters.  The author also gave us enough reminders from the first book that I didn't get lost (like I did with, for example, \\"Crossed\\", the follow-up novel to \\"Matched\\").  This could actually be read as a stand-alone book.  The only word of warning - while it's a YA novel, there are some four letter words and the premise is mature, which may offend some people.  Personally, I've already put the final installment on my \\"order when it's available\\" list in Goodreads!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of fun. Played for hours. I highly recommend this game. I will definitely look for more from fallen tree.i

B007SYWFRM|5.0|The best part of this game - especially since it's for kids - is that it gives you chances to earn and win acorns, which is the premium currency for the game.  Making games with pay-for content restrictions for adults is one thing, but I hate to see kids be disappointed and this game avoids that disappointment.  The little movie clips are awesome and the characters are great.  I also like that most content is not timed in the way that you have to come back at a certain time or &quot;lose&quot; things. If your child plays once a week there is nothing lost and the game is waiting.  It's great.  The little critter families are adorable.  Wonderful game!

0393338398|5.0|It's a team sport. That is what I have been told since my days of tee ball. However, contrary to what your parents and coaches have said, baseball is not a team sport. Basketball, football, soccer, hockey; these are team sports. Players must constantly strategize and use each other's abilities to succeed. Baseball, however, is a saga of individual narratives. Pitcher versus the hitter. Fielder versus the fly ball. Runner versus the fielder's arm. Unlike other sports, in baseball the defense has the ball thus it has the upper hand in controlling the sport. This is what makes baseball unique and utterly exhilarating.<br /><br />Moneyball documents the modernization of Major League Baseball. Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, has to figure out a way to win an unfair game. His team is from a small market, meaning he does not have nor should he ever expect to have the money and payroll of large market teams. Assembling a baseball team by conventional methods would only guarantee failure. So Billy Beane looks for something different. What he finds isn't anything new, but radically different. He finds moneyball. Using the numbers, data, stats, facts, figures, records, and other ridiculous items popularized by Bill James and assembled by his young squad of Ivy League economists, Billy Beane puts together a team of outcasts, misfits, and freaks that all have one very important feature: they get on base.<br /><br />Though there are plenty of critics of Billy Beane, sabermetrics, and the whole new way of baseball, there is one thing you cannot deny - it worked. The Oakland A's proved that you can build a team using the numbers and win and win big. Baseball guys hate this because it takes their experiences and flushes it down the toilet.<br /><br />You cannot deny the impact Moneyball has had on Major League Baseball. Every team today has a small army of baseball number nerds doing calculations.<br /><br />For those you want to know how the movie and book compare: the book gives you a realistic picture while the movie puts together a great story that incorporates all the information and challenges in the book.k compare: the book gives you a realistic picture while the movie puts together a great story that incorporates all the information and challenges in the book.
B0018RC7QE|4.0|\\"Mountain Dance\\" played Sunday on Jango, a radio player on the internet, and suddenly -bang-I was on a train in New York. And I couldn't remember if  it was ME on a train crossing into thoughts of someone I feel in love with, or if I was recalling a book, or movie and it was so delightful. Honestly what could possibly do that to a human? The music affected it instantly.  I played the piece over and over on youtube until I figured it out. Remembering this movie, recalled watching forever ago-who I was with-the times I saw it in. As I came to CA. It's been so many hard and complicated years ago. But it does seem amazing something could stay with you so long. Like a Mancini tune, say in Silver Streak, this charming piano piece, put me back into my memories of New York when I knew it in the 1970's.<br /><br />This is a romance, complicated by infidelity, about feelings, longings that irrationally can happen in falling in love. It will definitely upset someone who experienced being hurt by infidelity, and it has stayed with me in that strange emotional memory that is outside of my control. I rooted for DeNiro and Streep and I don't know why.  I still like the music, still enjoyed remembering seeing them together in the film and I love train movies. I utterly love movies like this- partially because of the train imagery.<br />No matter what I do the thing I can't bring up is how it ended. I recall how I wanted it to end. But.....I just don't know what happened.

B001FFBI82|3.0|Jarhead is a funny kind of movie about a very funny kind of war--the Persian Gulf War, perhaps unique among major American wars for featuring virtually no infantry warfare.  Jarhead is at its best when it avoids well trodden tropes.  The boot camp sequence and, to a lesser extent, the combat sequences, are the weakest of the movie.  Thankfully, both are very brief (although fans of traditional war movies looking for more of the same should take note of that lack).<br /><br />So what fills out the movie?  Waiting.  Lots and lots of waiting (and hydration).  Just how marines deal with that waiting (in a desert, no less), is the primary subject of Jarhead.  It's much more entertaining than it might be, veering wildly between juvenile and profane humor and dark and disturbing drama.  The marines walking through a shadowy hellscape dotted with flaming oil wells is one of the more arresting visuals in cinema.  It suffers primarily from a willingness to resort to Hollywood clich&eacute;s: a trainee getting shot during training, the obligatory war crime,<br /><br />Based on an autobiography, Jarhead carries with it some of that same ego, unreliability (one scene is based on an infamous urban myth), and meta-humor (at one point the main character complains the soundtrack is playing Vietnam music).  Entirely from a single marine's POV, we get a personal view into his questionable sanity.<br /><br />The blu-ray is strangely lacking in features, including only audio commentaries by the director and by the screenwriter and author.  The picture does look great.

It of course has a happy ending but be prepared to read some very detailed descriptions of Jaycee's life.  Amazing how she survived given what she had to endure at a very young age.

B0000009RX|1.0|The Mothers of Invention/Frank Zappa - We're Only In It for the Money (1968)<br /><br />I simply cannot believe how highly regarded this album is. It's astounding to me that people proclaim it to be a first rate musical composition. Truly, the music on WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY sounds like it belongs on a children's TV show. A perverted children's TV show not actually suited for children. There are elements of doo wop, ragtime and other old-fashioned sensibilities - it certainly doesn't rock. It's really sing-songy and really dorky. Yes, Zappa ridicules hippie culture with satire and he also criticizes mainstream society and police violence, but I don't find any of it to be particularly clever. Just irritating. And smug. Most of the songs here amount to musical snippets that don't last very long, which would be a blessing if they didn't immediately segue into yet another irritating song. Zappa's singing (or whoever else is doing it), when he's not simply talking, is sometimes monotonous and off key.<br /><br />The thing I find most irritating is this attitude that comes across through the words and the music itself (especially the way he uses the xylophone) that seems to be saying it thinks that it's the most funny, most clever thing ever made. Lines like, \\"You paint your head/ Your mind is dead/ That's yooOOOUU... American womanhood!\\" are delivered with this \\"nya-nya-nya-nya-boo-boo\\" quality that actually makes me want to smack the singer. I admit that there are a few segments that have genuine merit from a musical perspective (for example, the piano parts on \\"Absolutely Free\\"), but it hardly matters because the presentation is so atrocious. The music may be melodic at times but much of it is quite simplistic and repetitious. Some of the studio effects might sound kinda cool but in this context they just sound cheesy.<br /><br />Other annoying things about WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY: Zappa's engineer periodically whispers heavily-echoed narcissistic nonsense throughout the album...croaking frog noises are often heard...sped-up chipmunk voices...backwards guitar and other effects that merely sound like a child goofing off in the studio. Whether or not all this is supposed to be some sort of aural commentary on psychedelic pretensions, such a notion certainly doesn't make it worth listening to. This being Zappa, there's some disgusting scatological \\"humor\\" to be found, both petulant and babyish. The song \\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\\" has lines like, \\"wizzing and pasting and pooting through the day\\" and, \\"all the while on the shelf in the shed/ Kenny's little creatures on display.\\"  \\"Ronnie saves his `noomies' on a window in his room/ A marble to be seen/ dysentery green.\\" If kiddie gross-out humor is your thing then Zappa is definitely for you.<br /><br />The album ends with \\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny,\\" over six minutes of tuneless, utterly worthless musique concrete featuring a heavy dose of chipmunk laughter. Why WE'RE ONLY IN IT FOR THE MONEY has been called one of the greatest albums ever by sources like Rolling Stone magazine is completely beyond me. I'm utterly baffled. Zappa actually made some good music and he was an incredible guitarist but I contend that this record is complete and utter trash.<br /><br />Rating: STAY AWAYse throughout the album...croaking frog noises are often heard...sped-up chipmunk voices...backwards guitar and other effects that merely sound like a child goofing off in the studio.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was good, 2nd I thought was better.  It was sophomoric.  It had a twilight series type of feel, but with lots of sex.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I almost didnt purchase this series because of negative reviews. A reviewer posted low star, because this would \\"Never happen in real\\". Well I think so, because I can see the struggle the main lead female is having with the main lead male. Also I dont know if the author has personal experience, research, or just fantasy working for her in this story, but it is just that fictional point of view from her stand point.<br /><br />When I see a book with over 1000 reviews and most are good it is almost a given Im going to purchase at least the first book to judge the hype. I suggest if you are on the fence try book one and if it is good continue with other's in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it cool helps to pass the time. its very addicting. get it its worth it. no question hands down. b the best ever
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game so far and I particularly like the fact that you can actually advance pretty far without needing to buy anything (credits, etc.) ... purchasing them makes it easier to complete tasks but it isn't necessary to accomplish a lot in the game...
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I'd never played Freecell before and found this game quite enjoyable. I had purchased Brainium Solitaire and thought I'd try this. The only thing I wish it did was keep the stats; mine go away every time I power down the Kindle Fire. Other than that, great game!
B000002N2N|5.0|This is the Ramones at their prime. Raw and brutal. Heavy metal perfectly blended with bubble gum pop and good old fashioned rock'n'roll nostalgia. Here is perhaps the greatest punk band of all time at their prime. This after their first 3 or 4 albums before they'd gotten bored of these songs. If you get a chance to hear their later day live output, its too fast and sounds sloppy. Here they sound perfect. The best live album I've ever heard. Far surpassing Kick Out The Jams and that Cheap Trick live in Japan or whatever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game. My friend has it and she showed me it and I started playing it and afterward got it on my kindle.When I start playing it I can't put it down.
0316066524|1.0|I had always avoided this book in graduate school.  I suspected it was written by an intellectual who was overstuffed, yet cool and who probably used a lot of big words and deep concepts while still being a very dry writer.  A lot of people who were reading what they were supposed to read had this book in their hand and that also made me suspicious that I would find it very boring.<br />And so I never read it.<br />Until I saw that it was about tennis, and I love tennis.  So I thought I will pick it up on amazon for cheap.<br />I wish I had thumbed through it at a bookstore before I had done this.<br />It was exactly what my first impression is.  I was two pages in and started to feel confused, zoned out, and lost.  I must not be very smart and I am not ashamed to say it.<br />This book is either terrible or way too heavy for me.<br />Either way, I wish I could give it no star.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I picked this app up for free.  It's not something that I would purchase but it is quite fun.  It'll manage to keep me entertained while traveling. It's a well developed app and worth the free download.  I look forward to a more powerful version to take advantage of the power of my kindle fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy Solitaire.  The ads aren't a problem and the games are challenging, but fun and satisfying.  I highly recommend.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the app.it does freeze up at times or runs slow at times but other than that it's a good game.not a lot of instructions on how to play the mini games.that needs fixed because I'm not spending money on it I just want a game to play that wont cost me a fortune
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|used to play Oregon trail 20 years ago in school. I am glad to see that they have kept the game alive all these years.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really fun game to play.I enjoyed this game because it was fun and easy;but this app store needs more apps like the ipod app store or the android app store
006197806X|5.0|This review contains spoilers for the first book, Delirium.<br /><br />SUMMARY -<br />Lena Holoway is old, dead, and buried.  Lena Morgan Jones is new, reborn, and ready to fight at whatever the cost.  The memory of Alex, of Grace and her mother, are all she has left of her life before.  Her new life is with Raven and Tack, after a grueling time in the Wilds; she lives in Brooklyn, New York, where she is a student, a cured, a Zombie.  She has been charged with trailing Julian Fineman, son of prominent leader of the Deliria Free America.  When the two are thrown into an adventure they never bargained for, they must put aside their differences - and fight a forbidden love that can never be fostered.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS -<br />I read. I cried. I threw a fit.<br /><br />This book makes me want to pull a squirt gun on the publishers, Dick Harper style, and yell, \\"GIVE ME YOUR ARC'S! GIVE ME YOUR ARC'S!\\"<br /><br />I've said it before and I'll say it again.  It's something that never gets old, and I don't believe it will ever change.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is Brilliant.  With a capitol \\"B\\".<br /><br />And because of that Brilliancy, we have Before I Fall, Delirium, and now Pandemonium.  (I'm sure Liesl & Po is just as wonderful, but I have yet to read it.)  If I had to pick a favorite between Delirium and Pandemonium, I'd pick the first book, but its sequel is so excellent I cannot deny my love for it.  It is a Forever Favorite and will stay there for all time.<br /><br />Once again - Lauren's writing is freaking GORGEOUS.  It envelops you in warm, comforting arms and feeds you inspiration by the spoonful.  Even after the story is over, it sticks with the reader for a long, long time.<br /><br />CHARACTER NOTES -<br />Lena Morgan Jones is my new hero.  She's my role model.  If I could be half as brave as this young woman, then I'd feel like a superhero.  In Delirium, Alex is the one who causes her to bud into a beautiful, brave young woman.  Pandemonium shows the continued growth, the building of a new Lena who strives to do right by her memory of Alex, of her mother.<br /><br />Now, ahem, ALEX.  No, he is not exactly in this book as a character, but his memory shines for him, real and encouraging - to the reader as well as to Lena.  I loved the way Lena's thoughts of him, her motivation to make her life exactly what he'd died for her to have, practically brought him to life.  Oh, how I miss him.  I'm serious - I felt like I was Lena, aching for him, wishing for his strong guidance, but also pushing forward, fighting for another day, to live, breathe love.  That is why I love Alex.<br /><br />Julian Fineman.  Can I just ask a question?  HOW THE HECK DID YOU BECOME WONDERFUL AS WELL?!?!?!  After gaining composure...  Julian is...wow.  I wasn't sure of him at first, but now I'm dead certain.  What I'm certain of (besides his awesomeness) I have no idea.  I just hope Lauren has something awesome in store for him.  (Although, compared with Alex....he doesn't even compare.  Ok, so, we're not comparing him with Alex right now.  Sorry, I just can't help myself.)<br /><br />Raven, Tack, Hunter, Sarah, etc. - these are the men and women and children of the wilds.  They were all very clear and precise and consistent.  I mean, come on, these are Lauren's characters I'm talking about here - what else would they be?!<br /><br />STORY NOTES -<br />I'm going to be honest:  I missed 37 Brooks, Back Cove...Portland.  I really did.  But here, in Pandemonium, Lauren Oliver has built something just as real, just totally different - Brooklyn, NY.  An entirely new setting, a new structure, a strong difference in her MC - and yet everything felt as though I'd experienced it my whole life.  So natural, life-like.<br /><br />I really liked the then and now idea - how they were different times but they still melted into each other, seamless.  Lena's contrasted self was a beautiful thing to see, to be reminded of.<br /><br />Wanna know what really blowsme away?  The love triangle.  Yep, you heard me.  I flipping love this love triangle.  It's not giggling teenage girls with hunky men where all they want to do is make out.  It's something totally different, out-of-this-world, mindboggling: it's mature.  Yes, Lauren Oliver has succeeded in creating the mature and realistic love triangle I've ever read.  Now, I have my biases.  I'm a \\"first love\\" fan 1,000,000%.  But honestly, I trust Lauren's expertise.  What she says goes.  I'm placing my already fragile heart in her hands.  I trust she won't crush it.  (Ok, just kidding.  She's already crushed it and shredded it and mercilessly pounded it into the dirt a million times but...you get what I'm trying to say, right?)<br /><br />On the topic of love, I must say the love story in this one was a bit less believable, because of who Lena is and what she's been through.  I mean, with Delirium's slow-progressing romance, thick and delicious and wondrous, and with the world's best lit-man, nothing really compares now.  Because of this, Pandemonium's romance seemed quite a bit fast.  It was definitely beautiful, and still believable, but not as much as Lena and Alex's.  I sure do hope this makes sense...<br /><br />And then...WE ALL DIE BECAUSE OF THAT END.  WHY?!?!?!!  My mind seriously threatens to burst every time I even think about it because I can't even wrap my head around Lauren's brilliance!!!!  She is the Queen of Cliffhangers and Heartbreakers.  WHY do we have to wait till freaking NEXT YEAR to know what happens?!?!?!<br /><br />It's just....pure genius.  Pure.  Genius.<br /><br />SUMMING IT UP -<br />You heard me - pure genius.  From first page to last.  Every word in between.  Everything.  I'm seriously freaking out right now!!<br />Requiem:  I need you desperately, but you are worth the wait!!!<br /><br />For the Parents -<br />A handful of s**t, brief strong language (2 F's, 2 GD's).  Reference to \\"unnaturals\\" (two guys are apparently a couple).  A male character asks to see Lena without a shirt on.  She covers her breasts but he does get a peek at the rest.  A passionate kiss, some description.  They sleep in a bed together but nothing happens.  Recommended to 16+me away?  The love triangle.  Yep, you heard me.  I flipping love this love triangle.

B001RNO7BM|5.0|I was looking for a very supportive and comfortable shoe that I could wear daily on my sales calls. I wanted something that was like a hiking shoe but still had a casual wear look to it. This shoe fits the bill! I was concerned that the waterproof feature would cause my feet to be too warm, but that has not been the case so far. I have not warn them in high summer temperatures yet, but don't anticipate a significant issue with that. I followed the advice of other reviews for this shoe and ordered a half size larger and am glad I did. Great shoe!
B0055SWM08|5.0|yes, this game is a great purchase. please buy it right now. I want to support this developer. go usa
B0065AVS0K|2.0|The film was disappointing in every way. Pathetic , weak, unrealistic, garbage. I knew better and didn't finish.  Good luck with this one.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Supposedly this app has parental controls in the Settings menu. I was unable to locate it. I clicked Help in game and it takes me to the main amazon.com homepage. That's helpful. Needless to say, my child won't be playing the game until I can deactivate in-game purchases with parental controls that are supposedly there.
B00006LSM3|5.0|&#34;Brainwashed&#34; was George Harrison's final studio album (completed by Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison), and was released in 2002 (about a year after his passing). Ten years on and, it's better than ever. George Harrison has always been one of my favorite singer-songwriters and guitarists of all-time. And here on &#34;Brainwashed&#34;, he delivered some truly great music. From the album's opener---&#34;Any Road&#34; (which was a holdover from &#34;Cloud Nine&#34; days from 1987), with its chorus---&#34;......If you don't know where you're going....any road..will take you there......&#34;. Then we have---&#34;P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night)&#34;, which clearly demonstrated Harrison's sense of humor, then its &#34;Pisces Fish&#34;, &#34;Looking For My Life&#34; a great song, the mystical &#34;Rising Sun&#34;, the Indian inspired melancholy of &#34;Marwa Blues&#34;, &#34;Stuck Inside a Cloud&#34; the beautiful love ballad of &#34;Never Get Over You&#34;, a nice rendition of &#34;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&#34;, &#34;Rocking Chair in Hawaii&#34;, and the great title-track---&#34;Brainwashed&#34;. From start to finish, this was classic George Harrison, where he bade us all a fond farewell before his sojourn between---&#34;death and the new birth&#34;. I wish his soul-spirit, all the cosmic love of the universe and unto higher planes of existence!<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't watch the first two seasons when they were aired, but read good reviews so wanted to see for myself. After watching season 1 via mail from Netflix (it was a misery having to wait for the next disk to arrive), I watched season 2 on Amazon Instant Video. I breezed through the entire second season in two days. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next one immediately, much like a good book is impossible to put down until you've read it all. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching dramatic TV series' whether you have any interest in early 20th century England or not.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I wish there were more apps like this one. I do like games like this and yes I think it takes after Mario but I love that game to and would play all versions of this kind of game. Awesome graphics and easy to control. I am playing on the Kindle Fire with no proplems to report.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Very good book. It keeps you interested the entire time with history or memorization and how to strengthen it.<br />I would recommend it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I own both, this and QuickOffice Pro, and I rely much more on this app due to it having more features and being able to load bigger files. It's also the only office app that allows you to add notes to PowerPoint file slides, so is a must for college.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I don't normally review but I love so many things about this app and have shown it to so many people who in turn got it.  Love the earthquake list and map, easy to flip through stored cities and love the weather clock.  Use it all day long to see what to expect. Highly recommend to anyone.  So full of info in such an easy way to get to it.  Thanks!
0345803485|2.0|I like the premise of the story, but was this self published, without an editor?  This is honestly some of the most unrefined work I have ever read.<br /><br />It is a HUGE annoyance for me when someone within there writing repeats the same phrases and words over. Mercurial is a powerful, word but it loses the power ounces it's said very other page.  This is mark of a poor writer, in my opinion.  For example, the main characters have sex six times in a day and it is the same sex scene over and over:<br /><br />\\"I want him\\"<br />\\"Oh please,  Christian\\"<br />\\"He is touching/kissing/whatever on my a) sex or b) \\"there\\"\\"<br />\\"Yeah baby\\"<br />\\"Come for me, baby\\"<br />\\"I unravel and come \\"around him\\"\\"<br />\\"he then follows\\"<br />And says either \\" oh Ana\\", \\" Ana!\\", \\"god, Ana!\\", \\"Ana, oh Ana\\"<br /><br />So I ask, E.L.,did a prepubescent boy edit this novel? Gossip girl is leagues about this piece in quality of prose.<br /><br />Ps. E.L., see how I used so many different works for \\"book\\"?
B004SDEP38|1.0|SO I check the reviews....looks good....do the d/l....try to open a .pdf file &amp; find out I can't look at a file till I BUY the &agrave;pp. What's up here?
