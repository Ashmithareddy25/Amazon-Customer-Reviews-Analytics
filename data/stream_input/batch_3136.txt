B008JFUNHI|4.0|The premise of this movie is that moth aliens invaded earth 50 years ago, were narrowly defeated, and were sent back to their (or some other) planet. We are keeping an eye on them and it looks like they are running out of space. We've figured out that children, primarily tween boys, are the best at video games and interstellar combat. So far so good, pretty much works...Engaging plot and the acting is pretty good.<br /><br />Then this movie spends nearly the entire two hours with the main character, Ender, some other boys, and a token girl/puppy-love interest, going through various training camps, this goes on for probably 90 minutes. I felt the conclusion/battle/ending was rushed. Plus an intriguing side-story is underdeveloped of how, almost like a dream, Ender influences a video game he's playing on his iPad.<br /><br />There was an interesting Post Script Narrative that was thrown out at the very end - would have liked to see more on that too...maybe plans for a sequel?<br /><br />I think kids and scifi fans may enjoy this.
0375869026|3.0|I am a fifth grader and I recently finished Wonder. I rated it three stars and here's why: This book was well told and made you feel empathy for the characters. I like that the characters acted like people would in real life ,which is usually not the case with children's books. I also liked that the author didn't  sugar coat the facts; she showed that people betray you and hurt you. I didnt like the wording. In my opinion, the sentences were too childish to actually be spoken by a fifth grader.  While the story was good, it was not a page turner.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I used to really enjoy this app however after the last update my screen is black and sends me messages to update. After I try and update it stays black and I don't get a chance to log in. There is no way to contact anyone and it's just plain frustrating. When I first started playing this game it was a ton of fun and I really enjoyed it. Also I don't want to delete the app for fear I'll have to start over
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. Jason was good, the story line didn't really make you empathize with him or really want things to go the good guy way. He needed to have a little more depth. But overall it was a action packed movie.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Very informative book. My naturopath says that much of it needs to be studied more. But nevertheless, good to be proactive, or overly conservative in treating health problems.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|this is by far the best superman movie they have EVER made..can't wait for a sequel...  looks like DC finally took a page from MARVEL on how to make a super hero movie
0545586178|5.0|Catching fire is a very good book. Yes, it is good. Katniss is back in the hunger games, but now there is a war going on at the same time. She is fighting for her life and the lives of her family back home. As katniss and Petta go around the country on the victor's tour, they spark hope for the poor innocents that are forced to work in their district. Because of this, President Snow sents them and 22 other former hunger games winners back into the arena. There they must battle each other and try to survive the dangers of  the clock arena that changes by the hour.<br /><br /> Hunger Games Catching fire is not one of those sequels that lays in the shadow of its of its predecessor, but takes the series in a fresh, new direction that doesn't feel as much of the same.

Patty Duke took home a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her iconic work in `The Miracle Worker,' but Patty Duke's was hardly the only notable performance that year. Duke was joined in the Best Supporting Actress category by another young girl whose performance has entered the annals of the near legendary, namely Mary Badham's beautifully rendered work as Scout in `To Kill A Mockingbird.' There were a slew of other films that featured standout younger performances like `Lolita,' `Sundays and Cybele,' `Cape Fear,' `The Music Man' just to name a few, but no other film that year and arguably any year actually captured the viewpoint of children as magically yet realistically as `To Kill A Mockingbird' did. What's perhaps so incredible about this beautifully heartfelt film is how effortlessly it manages to sum up an entire generation's experience of one distinct region of the United States, namely the American South, dealing with all sorts of issues from the epochal, like race relations, to the seemingly picayune, like sibling rivalry and loyalty). While a major subplot of the film casts a rather unseemly light on the American South, the incredibly noble and moral character of the focal children's father, one Atticus Finch [Gregory Peck], an attorney who is hired to defend a black man accused of raping and beating a white girl, gives this film a strong ethical centre which further helps to distinguish it and which adds inestimably to the film's allure.<br /><br />Harper Lee was a largely unknown quantity when her first novel &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; was published in July 1960. Lee had been encouraged by her childhood friend and neighbour Truman Capote, upon whom the character of Dill in the book is based, and Truman Capote wrote a brief blurb on the dust jacket of the first edition hardback espousing Harper Lee's talent. Harper Lee had no great hopes for the book, and in fact the publisher had warned her it probably wouldn't do very well, so Harper Lee, and also not to mention the publishers, when the book was sold to the public, became something of an overnight sensation.<br /><br />Similarly, director Robert Mulligan wasn't exactly a household name, either, though he had had the extreme good fortune to have partnered with producer Alan J. Pakula, who would also become a director of some considerable note, and did have a handful of features, as well as a long television career, under his belt. But Mulligan's quiet, deliberate approach turned out to be absolutely perfect for ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’ especially with regard to coaxing absolutely realistic performances out the film's central trio of children, Mary Badham as Scout Finch, the six year old from whose viewpoint and memory of the film is told; Phillip Alford as Jem Finch, Scout's older brother and erstwhile protector; and the colourful neighbour Dill Harris [John Megna], who joins the siblings in a series of adventures, many of which revolve around ferreting out information about the Atticus Finch 's mysterious neighbour, Boo Radley [Robert Duvall]. As the children exploits play out, Attorney Atticus Finch, finds himself caught up in simmering racial tensions when a local black man Tom Robinson [Brock Peters] is falsely accused of having attacked a white girl Mayella Violet Ewell [Collin Wilcox Paxton]. Robert Mulligan resolutely refuses to ever let the film lapse into melodrama, staging things simply and without sensationalism, and that approach gives the film much of its indelible emotional power.<br /><br />In the trivial but fascinating department,`To Kill A Mockingbird' has one of the oddest concatenations of &#34;famous relative syndrome&#34; with regard to its cast and crew of any major motion picture. Just a brief listing includes these gems: Mary Badham [Scout] is the little sister of director John Badham [Saturday Night Fever]; Dill Harris [John Megna] is the half-brother of actress Connie Stevens; director Robert Mulligan was the brother of actor Richard Mulligan [Soap and Empty Nest]; and Estelle Evans [housekeeper in ‘Calpurnia’] was the sister of actress Esther Rolle ['Maude' and 'Good Times'].<br /><br />`To Kill A Mockingbird' is a quiet film, and in fact several studios passed on optioning Harper Lee's novel because they couldn't understand what possible allure it could have for audiences. &#34;It's about a lawyer and his two kids,&#34; was all studio executives and never the most prescient bunch, could see in the book, obviously missing the profound truths buried in Scout and Jem's world, like the treasures Boo Radley secrets away in the neighbourhood tree cavity. But like a parent whispering to a beloved child, `To Kill a Mockingbird' speaks directly to the heart, never demanding attention, but commanding it nonetheless. If you've never seen this hugely affecting film, you're in for one of the most touching experiences of your cinematic life. If you're a long-time fan, rejoice that it's been revitalised now to rediscover all over again.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – Universal Pictures, and the bane of catalogue title collectors, seems to have finally woken up and realised how to treat its asset treasures. Now this has happened with the release of `To Kill a Mockingbird' and is presented on Blu-ray with an awesome encoded 1080p transfer in 1.85:1. The film is part of Universal's well publicised 100th Anniversary promotional push to revisit many of its storied films, restoring and re-mastering them for home video release and not all of these legendary films will receive Blu-ray releases, unfortunately. This new Blu-ray has been sourced from high resolution scans of original 35mm source elements and the results are simply gorgeous. The clarity and precision of the image is breath taking at times, with beautifully modulated grey scale, deep, rich blacks and piercing, though never blooming, whites. Though the film and all of the supplements and saved for the restoration feature, are in SD, and there are absolutely no compression artefacts to report. The restoration feature, which actually covers a lot of titles, actually spends a few seconds discussing one aspect of Universal's high definition releases which seem to create the biggest controversy: digital noise reduction of grain. In the case of `To Kill a Mockingbird,' there were a number of optical push ins, as opposed to zooms, which magnified grain to a really ugly degree, something shown quite clearly in the restoration feature. Rather than &#34;erase&#34; the grain, which the team of restorers quite clearly state is unthinkable, they used a new algorithm which &#34;averaged&#34; the grain over the entire sequence, including before and after the optical push. The results should please even the most pernickety videophiles. Several scenes which have been murky in previous home video releases have whole new levels of shadow detail on this new Blu-ray. Well done, Universal and please keep up the excellent work.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – `To Kill A Mockingbird' offers both a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround mix as well as a standard 2.0 DTS mix. This would not seem to be a film especially suited to a surround track, and the good news is the track hasn't been overly &#34;tatted up&#34; to provide a false sense of immersion. The best part of the 5.1 track is the fuller representation of Elmer Bernstein's glorious score, one of the finest scores of the composer's long and legendary career for Leonard Bernstein's ‘To Kill A Mockingbird.' Ambient sounds occasionally dot the surrounds and especially with the rustle of leaves in that final horrifying Halloween sequence is a notable example, but the mixers have wisely kept things largely front and centre, as they should be. The audio fidelity is excellent and the soundtrack bears no noticeable signs of age related damage.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula: This is incredibly informative, though Alan Pakula can be a little hard to hear at times. Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, who were partners for such a long time, have an easy rapport with each other, and Alan Pakula coaxes a lot of anecdotes out of Robert Mulligan. This is totally excellent and highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Special Feature: Fearful Symmetry [1998] [480i] [91:00] This feature length documentary is by Charles Kiselyak, and is a loving if unshrinking look back on the cultural milieu from which `To Kill a Mockingbird' sprang. There are copious interviews with participants and contributors in the film, which includes Mary Williams (Narrator voice), Horton Foote, Robert Mulligan, A.B. Blass, Norman Barnett, Ida Gaillard, Alan J. Pakula, Gregory Peck, Cleophus Thomas Jr., Phillip Alford, Mary Badham, Elmer Bernstein, Claudia Durst Johnson (author of “Threatening Boundaries”), Collin Wilcox Paxton, Brock Peters and Robert Duvall. This insightful and interesting documentary also gets into some really interesting, if somewhat tangential, subjects like the importance of oral history in the American South.<br /><br />Special Feature: A Conversation with Gregory Peck [American Masters] [1999] [480i] [98:00] This is another totally fantastic feature length documentary.  In 1999, Gregory Peck [1916-2003] visits the Barter Theatre, Abingdon, VA, where he had acted in 1940 and where this evening he tells stories and answers questions about his career. Interspersed are clips from Gregory Peck's films and from interviews recorded over the years and v&eacute;rit&eacute; contemporary footage of visiting with his daughter Cecilia Peck before and after the birth of her son, receiving the National Medal of Arts, chatting with Lauren Bacall, with Martin Scorsese, dining with Jacques Chirac [President of France], and always with his wife of forty-four years, Veronique Passani, beside him. We also get other contributions from Colleen Sheehy, Don Peck, Carey Paul Peck, Stephen Peck, Anthony Peck, Zack Peck, Thomas Jones, Mary Badham, Daniel Voll, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Throughout, Gregory Peck is informal, candid, and wry. Directed by Barbara Kopple. Produced by  Barbara Kopple, Cecilia Peck, Kristi Jacobson and Linda Saffire. Music by  Art Labriola. Cinematography by  Don Lenzer, Sandi Sissel and Tom Hurwitz.<br /><br />Special Feature: 1962 35th Academy Award® Best Actor Acceptance Speech [1962] [480i] [1:31] This is a model for all the longwinded, self-important award accepters nowadays that was said by Gregory Peck and went as follows: “Thank you, fellow Academy members. Thank you, Harper Lee, Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan, Russ Harlan, all of my good friends and associates at the studio. Thank you, members of the press who cover the local scene, critics, and columnists across the country who approved of my work and said so. And I want to thank my family, my good, close friends, who have lent me inspiration and moral support and affection. Thank you very much.<br /><br />Special Feature: American Film Institute Life Achievement Award [1989] [480i] [10:01] This is a short snippet from Gregory Peck's AFI tribute, including a wonderful speech by the actor. First and last, however, it is the images on the screen that we remember and that we have come to celebrate. Gregory Peck reminds us that a star, ultimately, can be an idealization of ourselves, an image that not only mirrors our aspirations but fulfils them. At the ceremony they honoured Gregory Peck with the 17th Annual Life Achievement Award for allowing us and for so long and to see the very best in our world and ourselves.<br /><br />Special Feature: Excerpt from Tribute to Gregory Peck [1962] [480i] [10:09] This is another special Academy Award® tribute to Gregory Peck, including Gregory Peck's four children.<br /><br />Special Feature: Scout Remembers [480i] [12:01] This is a really fun piece featuring Mary Badham remembering her experiences with being in the film ‘To Kill A Mocking Bird.’<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer [1962] [480i] [2:52] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer of the the film ‘To Kill A Mocking Bird.’<br /><br />Special Feature: 100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics [1080p] [9:13] This is a special promo piece touting Universal's 100th Anniversary and their restoration and preservation efforts. The new slate of restorations is covered briefly, including some looks at the restoration efforts. Universal releases are regularly pilloried for over aggressive DNR [Digital Noise reduction], and there's a very interesting segment on this feature addressing that issue that all DNR-phobes really should watch. Other situations like flicker are also addressed. Audio restoration is also covered in this really interesting piece.<br /><br />U Control: My Scenes offers Cecilia and Anthony Peck narrating different PiP snippets which offer a number of participants like Robert Mulligan, Horton Foote, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford.<br /><br />BONUS: Universal 100th Anniversary Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray packaging includes a stunning 44 page booklet that includes  “INTRODUCTION BY VERONIQUE PECK.” “INTRODUCTION BY AUTHOR HARPER LEE.” “GREGORY PECK’S SHOOTING SCRIPT.” “ORIGINAL STORYBOARDS.” “ORIGINAL POSTERS & LOBBY CARDS.” “TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD PRESS BOOK EXCERPTS.” “PERSONAL LETTERS” and “GREGORY PECK’S LEGENDS OF HOLLYWOOD STAMP.”<br /><br />Finally, I'm not ashamed to admit I was once again in a flood of tears as `To Kill A Mockingbird' drew to a close as I watched it to prepare for this review. I've seen the film countless times, but viewing it with this stunning Blu-ray disc, it now has the same overwhelming effect on me, certainly a good indication of just how emotionally powerful the film is. How many films can you think of that lose little if any of their emotional resonance upon repeated viewings? `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of that rare breed of films which seems timeless even as it precisely recreates a very specific time and place. Classic film lovers have come to dread Universal catalogue releases, rightly or wrongly, but `To Kill a Mockingbird' sets a new standard for the studio, one which they hopefully will continue with as their 100th Anniversary Celebration takes centre stage. `To Kill A Mockingbird' instantly jumps to the front of the pack with this best release in 2013, and it comes 100% high praise. So all in all, I am so proud and honoured to now have this beautifully crafted classic film, they I will not tire of watching again and again. Very Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Andrew C.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I wish there more unlocked levels. But fun game for kids, not difficult even for 3 year old to play. Good. No educational value, unfortunately.
B0058SNIC6|4.0|This is my first pair of Crocs and I am glad I waited for a much cuter, more petite looking style than the original. Comfortable right out of the box and durable. I have been wearing them all summer and they still look nice. The black does come off on bare feet and if your feet get wet, you will squeak when you walk. But as expected when wearing a rubber shoe.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I wish there less ads and more game, faster, funnier, etc. But good and interesting even for 3 year old.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It only goes to level 440 on kindle but on my phone's app it has at least one more episode,...I'm on level 441 on there.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a really well-produced, quality, up-to-date version of Sherlock Holmes.  There are some really great touches that clue you in to how Sherlock gathers clues and some clever twists that bring it into the current century.  The acting is excellent, the scripts are believable and although the seasons are very short, the episodes are longer than the typical TV show - about 90 minutes each.
1439102813|5.0|Excellent book!  I lent it to my mother to read and she loved it too.  The story is well presented and you got to experience her feelings and emotions as well as those of her family and friends and medical personnel.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|My girlfriend and I thought we would watch Les Mis, as she is a huge fan. And despite Russel Crowe's existence, this was a great and fun film. If you are into musicals then this is the king of them. Subject matter aside this was a great production. Only thing I regret is not getting the HD version. My thoughts at the time were that this is primarily a musical not a visual production. I was wrong.
0345529057|3.0|First 2 books were great. The last two didn't really follow any logical order and the last book was absolutely the worst book I have ever read (nothing holding it together and the storyline was not compelling in any way). Sad, because the characters Martin created ARE compelling...just not the storyline in the last book. I wont be buying the next.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great Sci-Fi novel. This is a must read for any Science Fiction fan. A lot of people are put off by the fact that the protagonist is a child, but don't let that stop you this is a great book, with a deep and involved story.
0786888628|4.0|This is a top-down look at the Korean War, not a detailed battle-by-battle documentary. It recounts the war from a causal-based standpoint, allowing the reader to pinpoint why it started, what factors affected ts disposition, and how and why it technically did not result in a clear resolution. It only allowed South Korea to remain an independent and free country.<br /><br />As he did many components of WWII, Gen. McArthur was a major factor, perhaps the major factor in virtually all aspects of the Korean War. This is despite his arms-length management of the war and his absence from key final stages of the war and the negotiations that resulted in the cessation of active hostilities.<br /><br />The author traces how and why McArthur's profound stregths and weaknesses had equal and opposite effects on the war. In the end, his weaknesses far exceeded his strengths, he was releived of command, and potentially-disastrous events were largely avoided; potentially WWIII.<br /><br />As brilliant McArthur's strategy was for the Inchon invasion, his pernitious manipulation of war intelligence clearly lead to tens of thousands of UN deaths. He lead UN troops in turning back the initial North Korean onslaught, but his bravado, perhaps nationbuilding obsession, effectively enticed a huge China involvement; an involvement tragically minimized in the eyes of McArthur's distorted perspective.<br /><br />The book spends chapter after chapter on these several McArthus dichotomies because both he and they are as profound as they came to be. One might rationalize the \\"home by Christmas\\" rallying cry may have come to pass under the leadership of a Gen. Ridgeway, and the Chinese invasion may have been avoided by diplomatic measures. McArthur becomes almost \\"rogue\\" in function, as he takes his legendary ego and pan-celebrity status on the heals of WWII is taken to a highly disfunctional level. The checks and balances built into the military command structure were circumvented and blatantly disrespected, with calamatous actual and potential effects. McArthur is shown to be a national hero in the public eye, but also a commanding general with much hidden blood on his hands.<br /><br />The details of the Korean War battlefield are often gruesome, and this is selectively recounted. Why the Korean battlefield became what it did, at least for me, is ever the more gruesome because one might propose much of it was potentially avoidable in the absence of an ostensible American Hero's gross malfeasance. This much the author convincingly proposes, and the reader's ability to digest the facts and events makes this a very worthwhile read.

B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|You don't have to be an author or aspiring author to read this book. It gives one an insight in to the life of Stephen King and your admiration will only grow for this truly remarkable person. On the other hand if you are an aspiring author then this has to be the most helpful thing you will read. There is nothing flowery about the lessons he will teach you. And through his story you will either question your own determination or continue on your path. I loved this book and have given copies to friends as well as recommending it to anyone who will listen. Suitable for anyone who wants to write and anyone who just wants to read.
B0041D843M|5.0|You will find this book engaging and intriguing. It is written well, and Dr Campbell is a very learned man with many years of clinical experience to back his conclusions. As with all books written to prove a point or to promote a point of view, it is the reader's duty to read critically and to expect that some assertions are perhaps a shade strong for the data. (There are some fine critical reviews, with good discussions following, right here in your Amazon store.)<br />The gist of Dr Campbell's premise is that a diet which sensibly restricts animal fat and animal protein is healthy for us, and makes us less prone to diseases of affluence like diabetes and cancer. As with highly convinced persons in many walks of life, Dr Campbell has extrapolated his results to predict that a calorie-restricted diet excluding all animal fats and proteins must be very healthy indeed. I am only a layperson observer of human life, but my experience has been that immoderate behaviors seldom return the best results. In all things, including nutrition, balance well-meaning and self-discipline with good humor and self-understanding: living well in your skin is more like surfing than weight-lifting. Take it easy and stay loose.<br />That said, if you are interested in living at your best, you will learn a great deal from Dr Campbell's book, and find much to appreciate in his discussions. May you live long and well.

1455523003|5.0|An exceptional book, just like most written by Christopher Hitchens. The Catholic church will, obviously, condemn the book and the author too - as it is Vatican's habit since times immemorial: &#34;those that don't agree with us are against God&#34;. It is the very same religious organization that was responsible for creating the notorious Inquisition, a disgrace that the Vatican still did not beg forgiveness from non-Catholics to this very day.<br /><br />Mother Teresa apparently was suffering from emotional and mental problems, like most saints. Since she was quite useful to the Vatican and to the politically correct gangs, they all covered up the many signs of mental instability. The book is short and to the point and should be read by all Catholics interested in the truth and the reality of their faith.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|This is a great story for our little girls.  It tells the story of being the best YOU that you are.  I am sure this is a new classic.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|If you loved [[ASIN:0618485228 The Namesake]] and [[ASIN:B002LQC4MS Interpreter of Maladies]] here are more short stories by Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri. Lahiri draws from her experience as a Bengali immigrant to the US so has a kind of outside-in look at our culture and her own. (She was born in London to Bengali parents and moved here when she was two years old.) So Lahiri has a unique view of life as an outsider to both her own culture and American life. As such, she draws out the pain in family relationships, especially parent-child and husband-wife. Marriages can be arranged or not--and the uncomfortable fit of two people living together seems to be irrelevant to how they met, whether one meeting at the parents's house in Kolkata or a chance encounter at a university in the US.<br /><br />I think these stories are not quite as masterful as \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\"--the first story seems to drag on a bit long and is almost heading to novella status. And they aren't quite as sharp and poignant, either. The same pain and longing for connectedness is there and you can reflect on your own intimate relationships as you read. If you liked \\"The Namesake\\" better than \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" you may like this book a lot, because it has more in common, stylistically, with her bestselling novel.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of many Indian authors such as Ved Mehta, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and others. I love short stories and Lahiri's are masterful. I hope she writes more because I just can't put down anything she writes.

He try sometimes to be Herbie Hancock, but he can`t get it. If you like the first one you will love this one, if you din't ,like you probably like this second part.Good r&b, best soul, rap and all with jazz feeling. Is not a Experiment but is nice to hear it

B000002KDO|5.0|Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich has said something like, 'everything was hippy, dippy, trippy then along came Black Sabbath'. On Master of Reality Black Sabbath show they are not immune to the hippy craze. The lyrics bend or blend in with the best ideas of the hippies and the counter culture - with a dark Black Sabbath twist. Peer pressure can be hard to resist, and no doubt those were heady times. It may possibly have been a matter of the band wanting to fit in or grow, or shamefully (for me to notice) even an effort at self-promotion? One could argue the band could have chosen a better scene to fit into than that of the counter-culture, though it was no doubt ubiquitous, but try and fit in with the times they did. Winston Churchill is famous for saying, \\"if you are under 30 and not a liberal you don't have a heart. If you are over 30 and not conservative you don't have a brain\\". If you lived through the 60's and didn't get swept up by the counter-culture, you may have been right, but there was probably something a little odd about you. The lyrics on Master of Reality show an earnestness that is not unbecoming. To this day Ozzy Osbourne claims his favorite band is the Beatles.<br /><br />The songs on here are eclectic as well. After Forever is surely one of the more religious songs done in all of rock music. Sweet Leaf, which begins the album, is a pro-marijuana song. It's a simple song, and, while I may have liked it on first listen 35 years ago or so, in retrospect it's probably one of the weakest songs on the album, if not the weakest. I'm really stretching it with the '5 stars' for this album, but why not? On the song 'Sweat Leaf', you can really hear it when the musician's fingers slide up and down the stings to strike the next note. The sound is quite pronounced. Isn't there a way to filter this sound out? Or is the noise there on the first song to establish some kind of low-expectations for the listener? Maybe this is the first Punk song. . . Like Sweat Leaf, their previous album, Paranoid, also had a song about drugs, 'Hand of Doom'. Unlike Sweat Leaf, that song was an anti drug-use song.<br /><br />The press did bash on Black Sabbath a lot during their heyday. Perhaps mainstream, album oriented rock, needed bands like Black Sabbath to look down on? The Rolling Stones? That's just artistic social commentary. . Black Sabbath, on the other hand. . . Maybe it's all crap, or a least a bit vulgar. Perhaps the press looked down on bands like Black Sabbath to instill in their fans a sense of conscience, or perhaps we were just supposed to look down on a certain class of people (those more likely to like this kind of music)? There are bands out 'worse' than Black Sabbath. A band from the states would kind of copy Black Sabbath. A group called Black Oak Arkansas may have been kind of copying them. One of their songs in particular, 'Mutants of the Monster' may have been in part inspired by 'Children of the Grave'. It was almost as if someone said, 'hey, there's money doing this'. And who can pass up easy money? Not sure what was going on. One problem with Black Oak Arkansas is that their songs sucked. The song writers working with Black Sabbath were fairly competent, in my opinion. Whatever the reason, some of the copy bands make the British rockers sound closer to Mozart.<br /><br />The song Children of the Grave has more hippy like content with some weird or eerie sound effects included. Both it, and 'Lord of This World', which I may like better, both have some odd drumming in them and are nearly danceable. In the back ground music and solos on 'Lord of This World' I'm reminded of the song 'Iron Man' on their previous album. The sound worked well once, why not play around with it some more? Perhaps both songs are in the same key. What was it Nigel Toughnel said in the movie Spinal Tap, \\"It's in the key of G, when people hear that they begin instantly weeping\\"? Into the Void may be my favorite song on the album. They really experiment with their signature doom or sludge sound and then go on from there creating an 'epic masterpiece'.<br /><br />Just as a note of trivia: so often I've heard something like, \\"You know, Bill Ward sang Two songs for Black Sabbath (It's alright, Swinging the Chain)\\". Well, who sings Solitude on this album? According to Wikipidia, it's Ozzy. It sure doesn't sound like Ozzy. I'd always just assumed it was Bill singing Solitude. It probably is Ozzy singing, but hey, it's sounds so different, it could be anybody?<br /><br />Picking up this album after so many years I was surprised to hear a gunge-like element here. I'm not so sure they invented grunge, not at all, yet it surprised me to hear at least a little bit of that sound on this 1971 record. It raised my estimation of this album. And this is odd, and it does show the power of peer pressure, for I generally don't like grunge music.

B000002KE2|2.0|It's been said there was magic in Black Sabbath's first 3 albums, 'Black Sabbath', 'Paranoid' & 'Master of Reality'. I agree. The album Sabotage is quite good too. I like them all. I'm practically a Sabbath worshiper. Black Sabbath Volume 4, however, is a mediocre effort. Black Sabbath were famous for a seemingly huge amount of space separating each clearly heard instrument (and for being the kings of heavy), Volume 4, however, has an unclear muddy production.<br /><br />Volume 4 may have a sound slightly similar to that of alternative hard rock music. I have to admit, I don't usually like the alternative rock sound. Whatever the sound is on Volume 4, Black Sabbath would return to it some later in their post-Dio era. There are some good songs on Volume 4. 'Snow Blind', done in this style, or because of the song itself, is very effective. I would say it's a must for any Sabbath mix-tape or ipod collection. 'Snow Blind' is a song about drugs and it is not an overly cautionary one. Perhaps 'Snow Blind' sounds so good only because it's wedged in between so much crap. For the most part, in my opinion, the song writing on this album may be the weakest of that on any Ozzy-Sabbath album. I can still listen to Volume 4 but can only recommend it to collectors or die hard fans.<br /><br />This may be the first CD where Ozzy's singing style really changes. He sings here generally higher, and nowadays, even though he's only one voice, it can sound like a harmony. His new style is much better, in my opinion. Critics might say he sounds too whiny. It may be, before Volume 4, and after, as far as his singing is concerned. Perhaps it wasn't till Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, the next album, that we get the more modern Ozzy sound. Rather than saying his vocal style changed it might be more accurate to say he expanded his vocal horizons.<br /><br />I like the song 'Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes' a lot. 'Laguna Sunrise' is a soft instrument although not nearly as good as the very impressive instrumental 'fluff' on their next album Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. 'Changes' with Ozzy accompanied by piano is the slow/sad song on Volume 4. The song 'Changes' has been re-released a couple of times. I've actually seen a stripper perform to this song once at a club around 1990. It's kind of a surprise to me Changes is the slow/sad Sabbath song that's had a long life to it. Changes was re-recorded as a duet between Ozzy and daughter Kelly. I was so amazed when I heard this version. It is as if Changes was specifically written for Ozzy and Kelly.

B000002KHH|5.0|In a world where so much appears to be wrong, in fact even backwards, it's good to see something right. The popular consensus is that if you only ever get one Black Sabbath album Paranoid is the one to get. Overall I think I may agree with the popular consensus. This album may become 'classic'. I believe, in the world of literature, 50 years must go by and a work still be considered popular in order to garner the label 'classic'? 20 years after this album came out the sound of 'Iron Man' could be heard blaring out the windows of cars driven by those not even born when this album came out.<br /><br />When Ozzy or Sabbath were in the news a few years ago, I think due to being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, on one of those 'morning edition' television shows a young male host asked the 30 or 40-something black female host what her favorite Sabbath song was. Without hesitation she replied, \\"Iron Man\\". The young male reporter was almost stunned. I felt it was the right answer. The episode was likely contrived, with the 'live' version broadcast being the best of several takes, never-the-less this may have been her favorite Black Sabbath song, and it made for good theater. Iron Man may be the best Ozzy/Sabbath song ever done (Crazy Train and So Tired would be other songs to consider). In a way this album is a product of it's time (and offers a glimpse into that time) and in a way the songs have a universal appeal. They've certainly had a welcome longevity.<br /><br />One could argue some of the songs here are relatively simple but there's also something to be said for keeping things simple and doing it well. Perhaps I should take that back or expand upon it. In music, it seems you play a serious of notes before repeating the same notes again (perhaps sometimes slightly differently). In some cases Black Sabbath, and perhaps other metal bands, it seems they often try to play a greater number of notes before repeating the same notes or riff again. That's a sure sign of intelligence!<br /><br />There's a fuzziness added to some of the guitars here and they have an almost a high tech or even Sci Fi sound added to them. Ozzy Osbourne would explore this in a later song also sounding a bit high tech called Thunder Underground. Some of the songs are science fiction in their content (Iron Man and Electric Funeral), although, looking back one might say those songs are comic-bookish and about environmentalism, respectively. Oops, the song Planet Caravan is also science-fictiony. The song Electric Funeral stands out as an oddity because it has no guitar solo. If you listen closely to the guitar solos on here, there are often two separate lead guitars being heard. They are very likely overdubbed on top of each other. The second guitar often follows very closely the first one, almost echoing it. I don't think this is done to fool the listener into thinking ~ Tony Iommi is the best guitarist of all time. I think it's done because it sounds cool and it sounds appealing. Some of the songs are topical, 'War Pigs', 'Hand of Doom' and perhaps 'Paranoid' - although it could be argued (and has been argued) that these songs deal with issues we face in the modern world too.<br /><br />If you're only going to get one Black Sabbath album this wouldn't be a bad choice.

B00C5R7F8G|3.0|This book sheds light on the shadowy world of nuclear detterence, and the people in the US that have maintained the network since WW II. It switches back and forth between the accident at Damascus Arkansas, and the evolution of the command and control system of the US Military.<br /><br />There is a lot of good material here, well researched and documented. One is awed by the fact that a nuclear weapon was never accidentally discharged, and at the same time bewildered by a bureacracy which minimized the threat of such an accident.<br /><br />The reason that I only gave 3 stars was the somewhat clumsy jumps from the Damascus accident, and the history of the command and control system.

I hate explaining this book compared to the others bc this book really sets it all up for the rest. It's very different but interesting all the same. I think I'm going to read it again before the movie comes out.
B00G9U7R2O|4.0|Sequels, or in this case prequels, are a delicate proposition, especially when the first movie is as good as Monsters Inc. was. Maybe that is why it took for over ten years for Pixar to jump into a new project with everyone's favorite monsters. The benchmark they had to compare to was astoundingly high, and I am happy to report that they passed with flying colors.<br /><br />In the previous movie we saw how great a team Mike and Sulley were, and here we get to see how it ll started, and the huge bumps they had to overcome for that relationship to flourish. The film delivers plenty of laughs and I overall had a great time watching it. Maybe it is not exactly as perfect as the first one, but it was better than most animated movies out there. There are plenty of connections to the first movie, so you'd be well served by watching that one first. As a matter of fact, everyone should watch that one, no matter what.<br /><br />We get to see many of our favorite monsters in action, and we also gt to meet a new ones, some of them with extremely cool appearance and surprising abilities. The main plot has to do with how Mike and Sulley meet at Monsters University and how things developed from there. I liked that fact that they introduced fraternities and a competition into the story, since this spices things up.<br /><br />As was the case previously, the voice acting is out of this world, and provides this film with a very special charm. Another winner from Pixar!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played the PC version but I like this one so much better so far. I have had no problems with crashing like on the PC. Just hoping I can play and complete tasks without having to have tons of friends playing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is so awesome. My kids and I love to play this game. This is the best hidden object game so far and I play a lot of hidden object games. Please keep making hidden object games like this and keep them free.
1741798485|2.0|I checked these books for Andalucia:<br />- Lonely Planet, Andalucia, 7th edition Jan 2013<br />- Rough Guide, Andalucia, 7th edition May 2012<br />- Michael Müller Verlag, Costa de la Luz, 4. Auflage 2011<br />- Reise-Know-How, Costa de la Luz<br /><br />I was only interested in Sevilla, Ronda, the Costa de la Luz and the white villages north of this Costa; so I didn't use these books for Granada, Cordoba or Costa del Sol. The German-language book Reise-Know-How Costa de la Luz was so low on information that I sent it back to Amazon straight away - the other three books I used on my trip.<br /><br />In every city I tore out the relevant pages and stapled them together as a feather-light mini-guide for my pocket. In the mobile phone (with Spanish sim card) I also extensively used a GPS navigation app that's much more helpful than any printed city map especially in Andalucia's complex old towns (without GPS navigation, I'd be stumbling around Sevilla-Macarena still now) (bring an extra battery for long days). The TripAdvisor-app in the mobile can give additional suggestions, complete with your current distance to the point of interest (but several times I found that the best ideas for restaurants came from hosts and local contacts and certainly not from TripAdvisor).<br /><br />Rough Guide: The heaviest of all the books with far more information than the Lonely Planet (more towns and more information per town); but surprisingly, Jimena de la Frontera doesn't appear. The RG is very serious about the arts, history and churches with lots of clear judgements whether a church or a beach should be visited or not. Within their English text the authors use quite a lot of Spanish words which I did not always understand, especially when talking about church details and food. The RG authors sound as if they were rooted much deeper within Andalucia than the writers of the other books. What I missed was an &#34;Orientation&#34; section for each town, mentioning the main areas for business, entertainment and the main arteries (the Michael Müller book has that and it proved very useful, especially in combination with the GPS navigation). The writing sounds partly convoluted, with too many remarks between dashes, certainly not smooth and suave as the Lonely Planet. The restaurant sections mostly recommend places for Spanish food with lots of detail and (in the areas I visited) ignore the Italian restaurants that are there (and not bad). The city maps often don't show north on top, which I find utmost confusing. At least the city maps are coloured, allowing faster orientation (similar to the Michael Müller book, but unlike the Lonely Planet). I used this book much more often than any other, but still I wouldn't want to be left with only this.<br /><br />Lonely Planet: has much less information than Rough Guide or Michael Müller, the city maps are designed in a useless graphic style. The town of Gaucin is missing completely, as is, more importantly, El Puerto de Santa Maria (with several visitable bodegas and an easy day trip from either Jerez or Cadiz). The authors write like smiling sales-persons, smooth and suave and sometimes void of any real information, which might be expected in a glossy upmarket travel magazin or your Sunday paper's travel supplement, but is not at all appropriate for a guide-book that should be practical and easy to use. Still the LP offered some suggestions that other books didn't have, but on the next trip I wouldn't bother to put this weight into my bag; Lonely Planet is sinking lower every year.<br /><br />Michael Müller (in German language): has sometimes more info than the RG, especially for coastal towns. I compare it in more detail on Amazon.de.
B001EC2IT4|3.0|I watched this movie all the time as a kid.  I hadn't seen it in probably 15+ years.  It's kind of corny watching it as an adult.  And I'm actually surprised my parents thought it was ok for me to watch this as a 6-8 year old!  I wouldn't let my 6 year old watch this movie.  But all in all, the movie was fine and did bring back some good memories of watching this movie with my siblings and cousins.
160459201X|5.0|This book is awesome. It puts things in a proper prospective. I have purchased many self help books and this one leaves the others in the dust.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|fantastic! I'll watch this several times as i know there are little things I missed!<br /><br />Make sure you watch the credits at the end, too.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|have recommended to everyone I know. Loved the first season of Tue series and looking forward to the next book and season two
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love John Grisham's books. I loved reading about Jake again! If you are a fan you won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I enjoyed it a lot. I hope there's a third in the series!
B00008WT5J|4.0|A great album, with lots of classic tracks. This was AC/DC's closest attempt at a &#34;Best Of&#34;, back in 1986. Lots of classic tracks from previous albums, with only &#34;Who Made Who&#34; as an original track w/vocals. Sadly, only 1 Bon Scott track. Would've loved to see &#34;Highway To Hell&#34; on here.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Works like a charm. I play poker a lot and this is a life saver when I am on my phone the entire time. I think I may have sold a dozen of these from everyone inquiring about it at the tables.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Seems like it could have been a decent movie but the camera shakes almost non stop I got motion sickness had to turn it off.  It even shakes when no action is going on awful job on camera/production.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very erotic for mature readers but at the end she is sad and hurt. But passionate and sexy but sad at the same time. Enjoy it
B004GF244K|5.0|Fantastic performance.  George would certainly have been very proud.  It was a wonderful tribute for a Beatles member who deserved his due for his greatness.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book was way too depressing for me.  It's well written and the story is touching, but the overall story is way too sad and I couldn't wait to be done with it.  I've had several family members die of cancer, so it hit too close to home.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I took my family to see it with some friends at the movie theater. I enjoyed it. When my wife bought me BR3d; I watched it again, and loved it even more. As a family movie, it was spot on. Great origin story, great plot, and great acting. Special effects, and the music was amazing. In retrospect; I thoroughly enjoyed Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, and didn't anticipate liking this movie. Zack Snyder hit a home run.<br />Now for the bad news Zack Snyder; do not let Ben Affleck play Batman(The Liberal Crusader), and for that matter; why the hell would I want Batman in the movie to begin with. That trilogy is done, and you should let Superman fly solo on his own cape. Do you not have faith in Man of Steel? Did Batman have Superman in it before MOS? My advise to you is change it, and lose Batman; at least until The Justice League of America comes out. Oh, and I, and many more will be skipping the sequel if the moronic Ben Affleck is anywhere attached to this franchise.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I  just installed this yesterday so I haven't had a lot of time to try it out, but it seems to be working well. It is quick and easy to use.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Just downloaded on my new kindle fire HD..worked for the first three mins and then won't let me water Apple trees and harvest  so I can't continue.don't waste your time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun game to play if you are bored. Doesn't take long to get used to. Great for kids. To play
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Love, Love, Love this app! I am clearing the levels quick, easy to understand and quick to catch. Very educational and is helping me more than anything. I do mango, tried Rosetta, I can take DuoLingo anywhere with me and be able to continue where I left off. You have to finish the lesson to be able to start at the next one, if you quit or exit in the middle of the lesson, you have to start the lesson over, regardless how far you were. Love it though!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game immediately got my interest. A competitive game that is connected to Facebook. By the way my little sister can't get enough of it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Similar to Mario Brothers. Love it and love the first one! Son plays it and we just have a good time.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|Papaoutai, avf, and Tous Les Memes have me completely hooked.  Awesome blend of melody and dance.  Stromae masterfully blends rhythm with rhyme, melody with percussion.... I've been playing this album over & over since I bought it!<br /><br />Also worth checking out the music videos for these songs!  Very well done!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush! I find it difficult to get passed some of the levels and will be there for several weeks and then I break through! Great game. Addictive and wonderful for trying to pass the time.  Haven't had any problems with it. Thank you for bringing it to Kindle Fire!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|kept freezing my kindle fire. never made it through a whole run because of this. I would've liked it otherwise and would have kept playing too :(
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Similar to Mario Brothers. Son loves it, I love it. We play the game together. No issues and I just installed the Lep's World 2! We both enjoy the game.
B00G4I11YQ|4.0|This is one of those stories I find fascinating that it is not more widely known. I was particularly surprised that SeaWorld kept their own trainers and employees in the dark regarding their potential danger.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love solitaire, whether I'm playing by myself on my Kindle, computer or with cards. No problems with the game and it is my relax go to game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always said that I wasn't going to fall into the Candy Crush trap. I thought I had will power finally and gave it a shot to see what I was missing.......now I'm hooked and no one will ever see me again as I will be under my covers hiding.......while playing Candy Crush :)
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I much rather play this game on my computer than on y Kindle Fire. My fingers don't shoot the ball where I want it to go and I will be trying to aim the ball at a certain place and the ball just fires and I'm not ready. I'm sure I am lifting my finger quickly and pressing down without realizing, but I just much rather play it on my computer. Happy it came to the Kindle Fire. I find myself playing it every now and again on my kindle.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Now (DOCTOR-WHO) season one, was a great enjoyable show series to watch; And the 1st. Season (Doctor Who) actor I thought was great at playing his character.
B008393Q2O|5.0|Love, love this app! I use it for everything, from trying to remember little notes, errands, songs I hear on the radio and want to download, writing my grocery list or tasks I'm needing to do for the day, Christmas lists and birthday planning etc. I use it for everything! One of the main reasons I bring my Kindle everywhere with me!
B007EE4XKI|3.0|A active fan of the series, this was my first endeavor into the larger Starfleet realm. I was expecting a tween sci-fi romp through the alpha quadrant and was pleasantly surprised to discover a maturity and depth within the style.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the book, until the end. Was hoping for a little more than what it ended up being. Book was very intriguing and kept you wanting to read more. About a couple who have been married and it seemed so perfect and all of a sudden she goes missing. Of course you immediately think of the husband and all the fingers pointed to him, as the story continues and the clues get unraveled, it is a complete shock.  Would read it again, but was hoping for a little more at the end. Not everything is as it seems.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story is compelling and poignant and it is well worth wading through the first chapter which I found to be a very challenging start to an otherwise wonderful novel. The Book Thief made me change my mind about hating novels written from an omniscient viewpoint. Death sees everything. Markus Zusak has a fearless style and makes it look easy to write a story from the view point of 'Death&#34;. My only concern is that too many less talented writers will flood the publishing world with badly wrought attempts to copy his style.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I got the game for my son and he just LOVES it. We have the book as well and he goes back and forth between the book and the game. Great for educational purposes. Not just a game to pass the time, he is actually learning. Love games like this and so does he.
B008ADUHKW|5.0|Alice Munro is the queen of short story for a reason. She won a Nobel Laureate for a reason.  Her writing touches at the core of what it means to be a living, breathing, loving people. The personal nature of some of the stories in this collection adds to its depth and meaning.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|If you are a Pocahontas fan, or a Disney fan at that, the Pocahontas 10th Anniversary Edition is the best edition to buy.  It includes the previously missing/cut song &#34;If I Never Knew You&#34; integrated into the original storyline and artwork.  For the skeptics, or those saying &#34;how can one song make a difference?&#34;, I have to say that in this movie's case, the one cut song makes all the difference.<br /><br />When I first watched the cut/edited version of Pocahontas as a kid, it wasn't my favourite Disney film, because I felt that something was missing.  But, when I watched it again with the missing scenes and song, it elevated Pocahontas to being one of my most favourite Disney films.  The powerful songs and etheral animation seems to come together more cohesively in this version.  I choose to completely ignore the sequel even thought it's more historically accurate, because once you watch the 10th Anniversary Edition of the movie and see the love between Pocahontas and John Smith as they sing their love song, you will not be able to imagine Pocahontas ending up with anyone else but John Smith, let alone John Rolfe.
0394721780|4.0|Great book, I love the way Julia Child cooked! I pretty ofter use her tips and love her onion soup:)
0385342063|5.0|Even though you have to suspend some belief, it is a great romantic comedy novel.  I love the hilarious footnotes, and the absurdity of the e-mails.  It took me about 3 hours to read, and it was a great escape.  The book got me hooked at the first Poirot reference and the misshap with the Japanese businessman.  The main characters can come off as one dimensional, but I think that the experiences they share in the story turns them into brilliant characters.  This book isn't made to be analyzed and taken apart, it's meant to be enjoyed as it is.  If you can't get past the believablitiy factor, then, you will not enjoy this book at all.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I really like Behringer price/performance.  This was no exception.  It is a quality product and works well.  Will purchase Behringer again.
B000063Y8F|3.0|Never needed a garlic press. I like to use my palm but then you get that Garlic smell and it does cause a slight mess. I also peel and slice my Garlic. When I make Steak after my sear I like to add butter and a couple of whole crushed Garlic cloves with the skin, hence I am the owner of a brand new Garlic press. I have no problems with the design or function.<br /><br />I do have a huge problem for the fact that this is made in China!
B00005N5RM|5.0|Came quick, and just a great remake of a horror classic, up there with the Thing and the Fly for horror.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I never played the game on Facebook. I downloaded the app on a whim and I'm shamefully addicted already. Ha ha ha!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy Perry's best album yet. PRISM shows a more mature side to her without losing the fun. I love the lyrics and her vocals are getting better each album. \\"Love Me\\" is such a beautiful song. Touching.
B003AVPV1O|2.0|Solidly made and listed for a good price. Yet, those are the only good things I can say about this product.<br />The screen quality is drastically affected by this splitter. It produces wavy lines on both monitors that it is connected to.
B0000024JN|5.0|I love the Beastie Boys! This is one of their best albums. Full of great tracks and brilliant sampling. &#34;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&#34; is one of my favorite songs ever!
B00ERHGADI|2.0|The Lethal Weapon 2 disk is not Lethal Weapon 2. This disk is Swordfish. The other three disks are as advertised.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|Good price. Fast ship. I am rebuilding my SPN DVDs, this was great to get me started. Bought Season 7 and 8 separately.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Never been on this side of the law, I had always wondered just what goes on in women's prisons. This book gave me an eye to it. Women are women no matter what. We think the same we set our boundaries, we bond, we cry, we get into groups/clicks. This book shows us that being on the wrong side is not fun by any means. Can not say it was a great book but will say it was interesting and eye opening.<br />If your a women on the wrong side change! It is no place you want to be.
1878424319|5.0|I bought a copy for my daughters, my kid I mentor, my brother and myself. I love this book. Great book.
B005HSL626|2.0|It is fun, but there are WAY too many adds, i couldnt stand to play it for even 5 minutes, because every time you die,there is another add! The adds ruin the game:(
B00F031XPS|4.0|The documentary is good, not great. I have liked other documentaries better, and I honestly wasn't even buying this for the documentary. But I have to take a star off for the *inexcusable* audio sync issues during the documentary.<br /><br />But it gets a solid 4 stars for the bonus footage and amazing quality of this newly discovered footage. So buy it for that. Take or leave the documentary portion.
B00E6890RG|5.0|Holy Crap!!! This is one of those rare records that grabs you and doesn't let you go. Parts are like Gentle Giant on steroids, there' s some old King Crimson in there too, but most of all there is stellar muscianship serving up some nicely arrainged prog for your listening enjoyment! The first two albums were great, but this one is a big step forward! I keep pleying it over and over..... It's freaking Great! ......and they're just getting started......
1781162646|5.0|The storyline was different from the usual Stephen King genre, but he did a great job writing a murder mystery that had a ghost thrown in for measure.  Truly enjoyed it and have passed on to a family friend who has read every Stephen King book written to date!
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|It took me awhile to warm up to the Flower Kings. I thought there was too much instrumental doodling and that the songs themselves were weak. I have changed my mind with the release of their last two records! Strong song structures. Killer Guitar!!! I mean is there anybody who solos like this guy.... Their style IS a bit quirky, but it's prog isn't it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic story that kept me riveted to the page from the first paragraph.  Its an intense fast moving story, that keeps<br />you totally wrapped up in it for weeks after you put it down.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Informative without burdensome detail, Chris Kyle mixes human interests and the need  for cold, careful analysis in laying out the difficulties of killing fellow humans in the conflict of evil being punished for the greater good of mankind. He never loses sight of being watched by and accountable to God. His wife's perspectives add depth.
0062107313|5.0|I am always astounded by reviewers who compare, always unfavorably, the book they have to some book that they feel should have been written.  Many of the reader reviews I read here fall into that category.  Taken on its own, The Valley of Amazement is a marvelous, nutritious and fulfilling novel, a ripping good yarn.  It has, of course, the elegantly simple and lucid prose that Ms. Tan is noted for, as well as the touches of magic and the unique characters she always seems to find.  But it also has a sweep and range that Tan has heretofore not managed, all the time preserving the intimate connection of the reader to the scenes, the times, and the actors portrayed.  It needs to be a mini-series with high production values produced by HBO or Showtime.  I would predict an Emmy.  Don’t listen to any of the naysayers, who should, perhaps, themselves write a book that will satisfy their desires rather than be petulant that Tan didn’t write it.  Read it and decide for yourself.  You will be, well, amazed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found part 1 (about Holston) a thrilling and chilling short story. To my pleasant surprise there were four more parts to Wool. Loved all five and now working on the sequels (Shift). Best purchase I've made on Kindle all year.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Best GPS running watch ever. It is a touch bevel (not screen), so after it gets sweaty, it will be difficult to use the touch feature, only the buttons. But during your run, you will not need to use the touch screen for anything. I unlock the screen to turn on the GPS, catch a satellite signal, lock the touch screen so that only the buttons work. Press the start button. Run. The top button is for start/stop, and the bottom button will mark a lap if pressed. At the end of the run, stop the timer. Simple.<br />You need the heart rate monitor for this one. I swear to you that I never leave for a run without it.<br />Oh...but the way...you can use it overseas and the Garmin  program will still map out your runs. I have runs from Cambodia on the program. Good times. Buy this watch...it was discontinued and a commensurate Garmin watch is $400.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Lovely. Just absolutely incredible. Bought this for a friend as a birthday present. Vinyls give a different feel that you just can't get from mp3s these days.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|It is a funny and fast moving film, but without anything special. The special effects are well made too. I liked it.
B00B3HJMLM|3.0|The songs are about (1) Drinking, (2) Women, (3) Drinking with Women, (4) Hooking Up, (5) Remembering a Good Hook-Up, (6) Wishing He Were Drinking, (7) Wishing He Could be with a Woman, (8) Wishing He Could Be with a Drunk Woman.<br /><br />Then again, the album is called &#34;Here to Party,&#34; so there's no false advertising.  I do hope that Luke's lyrics in future albums are more reflective and introspective.
B009NX1YT6|4.0|I watch this movie from time to time because of the musics. But it is also nice to see John Travolta in his beginning.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Classic. No more to be said. -Em Fan Since 1999 Eagles Ballroom helped cement his status as one of the greatest rappers of all time.
B00005JO20|2.0|eh. We had such high expectations after the Lord of the Rings.  I guess they can't all be awesome. Two thumbs down in our household.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Very good Bond movie...not as good as Casino Royale...but still very good....I would recommend it to others....I enjoyed it....love free Prime movies
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Castle Ville Legends is so much better than the original.  Was hooked on the original and went through withdrawals when I became addicted to my Kindle Fire HD (can't put it down) was so happy to see this new game added. Now I don't want to stop  playing.  THANK you Kindle &amp; THANK you Zynga.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Maybe I am easily entertained, I liked this book, you just have to be careful and pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters, that way you establish the timeline in your head, since the book bounces around time-wise. The characters are very much what you expect from that time, the British nobleman, the German analytic mind, the American quiet but brave guy, the Russian hardcore survivors of poverty and a evil monarchy, who are not afraid to fight, again I loved it.<br />At one point I was hoping one of the Russian characters was one of the guys that shot the Romanovs....maybe he does I'm about 90% done, this book is awesome and very long, which is fine
B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|I thought this episode was pretty good. Some will say it was a bit boring but there have been plenty of other episodes that have been mostly dialogue with little action. Also there is nothing wrong with taking an episode off the normal characters to have an episode further developing the antagonist.
B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|I can not stand this character and I am not alone. And an entire episode (not worth watching) dedicated to him? The writers should listen to the fans of the show. Unfortunately, I think this will be the last season. What a shame.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Pretty awesome game, i really like its unique playing style. Found it enjoyable to play. Go for it download it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like how accurate it is with the weather.  It helps me plan for the worst when I travel.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to keep up with the weather.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Too much trouble for me to fiddle with to get it to work properly. While I was in Chrome browser it could not find my device. Sometimes it would. But most of the time it wouldn't. Returned it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Great TV Series.  What an incredible mix of characters from different worlds.  Glad to have it of DVD to see it again.
0545128285|5.0|Now this was an amazing book on fairy tales from the Harry Potter series I enjoyed each and every story in this book.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The Sherlock Holmes movies are great one's to experience.  Robert Downey Jr. does an incredible job in playing this character.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This was an amazing movie it had action but I of course loved the fight scenes between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes they are my 2 personal favorite characters in the movie.
1442362537|5.0|King is back and in great form . This is a good one ,written in his &#34;old&#34;style (scary) . Much has been said about the storyline and so not to repeat the obvious , I will remark on the reader,Mr. Will Patton. I don't think a better choice could or should have been made for this intriguing story . Patton adds his own personality,complementing the experience  . Buy the book for the excellent story and if you've strayed as a follower of King ,this book will serve to re-introduce  you to the total King experience.
B004G600A4|5.0|One of my favorite movies I enjoyed it because I love the princess theme and I am a huge fan of Rapunzel and have been since I was a kid she is one of my favorite princess right behind Belle of course so I truly enjoyed this plus I liked the music as well.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is sort of a guilty pleasure for me. I've watched it with my girlfriend a bunch of times. It's great. It came in perfect condition and there were no problems with shipping. Buy it!
B005LAII44|5.0|I love this movie it was amazing and it had plenty of action I enjoyed each and every fight scene but I also enjoyed the story.
B001B68XRY|3.0|If you like Adam Sandler then this is more of the same type of funny. The movie could have done without the &#34;queens&#34; that part took funny and just made it gross. Also the inmate that admitted to doing things with other inmates again had no place in the over all movie.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I would love to give this game a better review.  However, it needs a delete button for unwanted items.  I need more space.  In order to add space I must finish a challenge. I need a juice machine and their is no room. So I am stuck and all I can do is spend real money to purchase more space, or just plant crops until I have a zillion dollars. I THINK I WILL JUST JUST STOP PLAYING.  I am not spending money for blips on a screen.  Too bad because it is a cute game and relaxing . I started playing a long time ago on my computer. I remember now, this is why I stopped playing.  I have been playing on my Kindle Fire lately and now here I am stuck again.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Took a while to load but it looks nice so far<br />Graphics are beautiful.  Will take awhile to get used to the touch controls.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book it makes me feel her pain her joy her sadness. This book is spontaneous.what I didn't like was absolutely nothing
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it...wonderful story with many twists and turns. Another movie in the making, bring on Hollywood!! Thanks John Grisham for another wonderful novel to add to the collection!!!
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book.  An awe-inspiring look into the lifestyle of the best soldiers in the world.  These elite warriors are the absolute best at what they do, and this book let's us &#34;normal folk&#34; get a glimpse of their secret life.
1600597963|5.0|Everyone else has said it so well.  This is a book for learning basics of stitching and design. There are some good projects, and photos of excellent design throughout. The techniques are very well explained.  I know I'll be going back to this frequently.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|It's a good happily-ever-after fairy tale.<br />A note to parents, though, the final battle with the witches has this rather gory moment when the hero frees the wolves.  I wouldn't have wanted my kids to see it when they were little.
6305428042|5.0|Great family movie. My 5 year old granddaughter loves it. She must have watched it 5 times. I love this movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game, entertaining, does keep trying to get you to purchase add ons as energy does run out quickly, but just leave the game for a while and it will rebuild its self.
0316204366|5.0|Another thought provoking book from Gladwell. In this book he explores how to turn your disadvantages into advantages and how to be a big fish in a little pond. One of my graduate professors hit on this idea but Gladwell elaborates much more in-depth. It is a quick read set up logically. I rarely find books that confront my reality in a logical way that make me reconsider how I construct answers to life questions. Gladwell has a way of looking into societal norms and make you think hard about what you perceive. Even if you don't agree with the viewpoints, it is still a thought provoker. I highly recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is awesome if you like temple run get this game because it is awesome get  if you like temple run.
B009LRE040|3.0|This movie was ok. Everything was too over the top and not believable. Anne Hathaway was terrible, I'm glad she wasn't referred to as catwoman. Gordon Levitt was useless in the movie. The ending was horrible, a nuke explodes and batman lives, remember no autopilot! No way he's survives that. I feel bale wasn't really into playing batman this time around and kinda just mushed the character a long. But a billion dollars grossed..what do I know. Bane was the best thing in the movie. I couldn't wait till it was over, I'm glad I didn't see it at the movies.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I cannot go to sleep without it playing. My children even tell me they need it to sleep. The variety of sounds an timer option is a plus. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to listen to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; noise.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Reminded me of the total chaos of military operations and complete lack of communication from the top ranks to the PFC's.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|No commercials, great color/sound/clarity.  My new favorite thing to share with grandkids one day.  I had not realized until viewing most of the episodes that there is a clear message that we should always accept each other and embrace the differences and not interfer with other cultures unless there is a clear human right issue.  Who knew this message was the cornerstone to this series.  Excellent viewing for those young minds in tolerance/acceptance, fairness, love and loyalty.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Just got this on Friday, along with a few other titles, like the Bowie \\"The Next Day: Extra\\", and being a longtime Gaga \\"Little Monster\\", I consider myself an authority on her music, because I get her and her style and what she's trying to accomplish on each record...each one has its own mood, style and flavour, but one thing each has in common, that being an element of the experimental and underground mixed with pop, and \\"ARTPOP\\" is no different.  \\"The Fame/Fame Monster\\" is a hybrid of club music and powerpop and new wave, heavy on the 80s, and her vocals were very Terri Nunn (Berlin)...\\"Born This Way\\" was much darker and influenced by heavy metal and arena rock...\\"ARTPOP\\" is back to an 80s focus but more experimental, underground club, electronic, punk and new wave...it's her Lene Lovitch record, and also among her catchiest and offputting music yet.  EVERY song is catchy!!  Yes it is, every single one!!  If you disagree, you don't know catchy...catchy is not an opinion...every one of these songs has an earworm that breaks through every ear & brain barrier...now, each song has its own feel and style, but they ALL have a catchy hook, or three...how anyone can hate this is a mystery...this is creative (yes) ARTPOP...<br /><br />I have just started to delve deeper into this, so my review will continue later, but already, the title track is a really swell spacey CATCHY electronic pop anthem, \\"Venus\\" reminds me of \\"Le Disko\\" by Shiny Toy Guns in the best catchiest way possible...opener \\"Aura\\" feels like \\"Judas\\"' lighter cousin...the only one that threw me off so far was \\"Jewels & Drugs\\" because of those rappers, but her part is great...the R.Kelly duet is offputting at first, but it's like the best Christina Aguilera song she's never done meets Nine Inch Nails gone catchy pop...\\"Dope\\" is a stunning theatrical ballad...and \\"Applause\\" is like Lene Lovitch for today and even catchier than the catchy classic \\"New Toy\\"...I'm gonna listen much more and I will then come up with faves....<br /><br />As for those who trash this album...yes, everyone has opinions, but you have to look at things in the right context for those opinions to have any merit...like, look, I hate Avril Lavigne, who doesn't have an ounce of talent or innovation or guts in her whole body than Gaga has in her pinky finger...but her new album has some undeniable catchy hooks, but it's no \\"Artpop\\", no way, no how...those who say \\"Artpop\\" is NOT catchy is lying or off their rocker or they don't GET catchy...those who trash this has no taste, those who say this is a disaster or Gaga is done...doesn't have a clue!!<br /><br />Yes I am a fan, but I am not biased...nor am I disappointed in the least...this is actually quite delightful and I am happy she is NOT repeating herself or old ideas...this is fresh Gaga...<br /><br />To be continued...<br /><br />Just heard the whole thing, top to bottom, and it was, on a whole, so good, that I had to run it through a SECOND time!!  Now, yes, there are a coupla filler tracks that work better as \\"bridge\\" tracks to give the record structure but would not work as standalone singles...one of them being \\"Swine\\"...but they do serve a purpose...every great record has these \\"bridge\\" tracks to make it work...AND I just read that \\"Act 2\\" is coming next year, with even MORE experimental tracks that were not on this \\"Act 1\\" disc!!  But let's go through this 1st 15...<br /><br />1-- \\"Aura\\"...4.5 / 5...a great opener, kinda like \\"ARTPOP\\"'s \\"overture\\" song...sets the mood but would not be a good \\"single\\"...but I dig the Middle Eastern vibe and it sounds like \\"Judas'\\" lost cousin...<br /><br />2-- \\"Venus\\"...5/5...killer great, reminds me of \\"Le Disko\\" by Shiny Toy Guns and the chorus just slays, on top of that, the \\"Uranus\\" joke was a fun touch that works...<br /><br />3-- \\"G.U.Y.\\"...5/5...another killer chorus-filled song and I like how \\"G.U.Y\\" is a female abbreviation and \\"G.I.R.L.\\" is a male abbreviation, nice twist...melody here is sooo catchy!!  The style is like \\"The Fame 2013\\" too...<br /><br />4-- \\"Sexxx Dreams\\"...5/5...3 catchy-to-the-hilt songs in a row, and it's unedited...love her choruses, her tuneful belt...will be killer live...<br /><br />5-- \\"Jewels n' Drugs\\"...4/5...the first uh-oh song here which, whew, escapes from the crapbin by sheer creativity...I'm not a huge hiphop fan, but I like some of it, and this song shows Gaga is a fan...like Green Gartside from Britpop act Scritti Politti, who recorded the 1999 album \\"Anomie & Bonhomie\\" infused with hiphop, both made their hiphop forays work equally well...her's by a cool catchy chorus that is very Gaga...<br /><br />6-- \\"MANiCURE\\"...5/5...one of my faves here, with that amazing chorus and punky guitars...will be a live highlight for sure & remixes will be ace, as the song has an energetic rush, woah!!...<br /><br />7-- \\"Do What U Want\\"...5/5...featuring R.Kelly, whom I've always respected as an artist but was never really a fan...this song not only works structurally as an early Nine Inch Nails-esaque industrial pop tune a la \\"Head Like A Hole\\", but mixes it with a sly R&B groove like a mad scientist, combining that with a lyrical twist \\"Do What U Want with my body!!\\", really clever...R's vocal blends well with Gaga and her performance is like the best Christina Aguilera song she's never recorded, like how she sings \\"BoDAY\\"...I'm curious if upon hearing that, she's slapping herself \\"dammit why didn't I thhink of that??!!??\\"<br /><br />8-- \\"Artpop\\"...5/5...the REAL surprise of the album...just wow...melodic and spacey in equal measures, with an underground new wave synthpop backdrop that is reminiscent of 1981 WLIR bands like Visage and Blancmange, but modern 2013 at the same time...I can play this track over and over...creative and cool...and I love how she means \\"My ARTPOP can mean anything\\"...like YOU come to your own conclusions...BRILLIANT!!<br /><br />9-- \\"Swine\\"...3/5...the first (2nd if you kinda count \\"Jewels N Drugs\\") \\"bridge\\" track here, not a single by any means but serves its purpose...the industrial/dubstep hybrid approach is pretty cool, and the lyrics darkly funny, but could have been offensive but aren't...interesting how she uses the words swine, pig & disgusting in a song that works...<br /><br />10- \\"Donatella\\"...4/5...pretty cool song that is a commentary on classes, with a catchy chorus to boot...borderline on whether this could be a single or not, but it's not skippable.<br /><br />11- \\"Fashion!!\\"...5/5...I don't think this is the same song as she recorded YEARS ago but went unreleased or not...I know she released a song under a similar name for the soundtrack to \\"Sex & The City\\"...but this is a great song nonetheless, great chorus as usual, and it fits here well but would have also fit well on \\"The Fame\\" too.<br /><br />12- \\"Mary Jane Holland\\"...5/5...this is a fun catchy pot song with a Hollywood twist...not shocked at all because I know Gaga is a total pothead, and it's basically accepted & mainstream today as no big deal, and is on its way to being 100% legalized, as it should...love how she lights up in the song too...<br /><br />13- \\"Dope\\"...5/5...2 pot-referenced songs in a row, go Gaga!!  But this song not only stands out as \\"ARTPOP\\"'s only TRUE BALLAD, BUT it's also just stunning in execution, as a \\"damaged\\", theatrical ballad, really raw, bruised, emotional (with expletives), stark, borderline unstable in the best way possible, as if to put the emotions waaaaayyyyy upfront...you really feel Gaga pouring her heart out here, almost to the point of basically breaking down before our very ears...PLUS producer Rick Rubin does the honours here, similar to the approach he brought to Lana Del Rey's ballad \\"Ride\\", as well as stark efforts by Johnny Cash & Neil Diamond...<br /><br />14- \\"Gypsy\\"...5+++/5...just WOAH and WOW!!  People have stated this song's similarity to \\"Edge Of Glory\\", and they are not wrong, but what makes this song work just as well, if not BETTER, is the element of surprise...you have no idea what's coming, THAT CHORUS...I mean, you do, but not like THAT...and it gives you a bigger rush, like a superb rollercoaster where you don't see the magnificent drop ahead...then WAAAAAHHHH!!!  Fave song on the album among many MANY highlights...<br /><br />15- And we have \\"Applause\\"...5/5...it's a cool, fun new wavey synthpop song like Lene Lovitch's \\"New Toy\\" but 2013...placed at the end, after \\"Gypsy\\", it's a nice album endcapper or encore...I don't want to call it an ANTICLIMAX or anything, but this song would have been better served to be near the beginning rather than at the end...maybe Gaga wanted listeners to focus on the album's art and treats in full rather than the single and skip the rest??  In a live setting, \\"Applause\\" would be better at the end, not on an album...maybe there is a hidden message in the sequence??<br /><br />All in all...this \\"ARTPOP\\" is as worthy as any of Gaga's past works, and it makes me look forward to the future...\\"Act 2\\", bring it on!!  This record just cements her longevity and that she is a career artist, not a bright, brief comet...plus she's singing in space in 2015...that's apt!!here, not a single by any means but serves its purpose...the industrial/dubstep hybrid approach is pretty cool, and the lyrics darkly funny, but could have been offensive but aren't...interesting how she uses the words swine, pig & disgusting in a song that works...<br /><br />10- \\"Donatella\\"...4/5...pretty cool song that is a commentary on classes, with a catchy chorus to boot...borderline on whether this could be a single or not, but it's not skippable.<br /><br />11- \\"Fashion!!\\"...5/5...I don't think this is the same song as she recorded YEARS ago but went unreleased or not...I know she released a song under a similar name for the soundtrack to \\"Sex & The City\\"...but this is a great song nonetheless, great chorus as usual, and it fits here well but would have also fit well on \\"The Fame\\" too.<br /><br />12- \\"Mary Jane Holland\\"...5/5...this is a fun catchy pot song with a Hollywood twist...not shocked at all because I know Gaga is a total pothead, and it's basically accepted & mainstream today as no big deal, and is on its way to being 100% legalized, as it should...love how she lights up in the song too...<br /><br />13- \\"Dope\\"...5/5...2 pot-referenced songs in a row, go Gaga!!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product. The Google Chromecast works well, with no problems. I wish there were more things to screen, but rumor has it that more are soon to come.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Very easy read.  What a hero and good guy.  Such a shame to lose someone like that from this earth.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Movie was ok. It started off slow, ended slow. A lot of great actors. The idea behind the movie is sort of cool.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Sad addiction,but I am happy to see finally available for Kindle Fire. LOL!! What took you soo long Amazon?! LOL!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Leonardo Dicaprio is great in this. Its very spot on to the ideas in the book, with a updated flair. Worth giving a watch.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|super easy to read, i like how he tells the story from all the characters. It was just wonderful. I liked the movie and loved the book.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I listened to this album straight through, and on first listen I only heard a few songs I instantly loved and was bouncing to. But then I listened again. And now I'm addicted. I can't get enough of Gaga's voice and I was anticipating this album for months. My favorites are &#34;Do What You Want&#34; and &#34;Dope&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game.I didn't think it could get any better.But the new Halloween version is even better than the birthday version which was even better than the first version.I'm sure the next version will be even better...
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|The most awesome stupid (or the stupidest awesome) movie ever.  Yeah, the story is goofy, the characters are 1-dimensional, but lets face it, the monsters vs. aliens is awesome.  Very much appreciate that the director realized we actually want to see the fights instead of blurs of bright colors.  And it's nice that the stereotypical disaster movie romance didn't happen.  My inner 9 year old is very, very happy with this movie.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Very good read. Looking forward to the next story. Read all 5 in a row and could not put them down.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|In a last few years I've built a hundred people consulting company with 90% of employees working remotely. Reading this book was very fascinating, in many cases like reading own thoughts layer down on paper be someone else. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in exploring new possibilities with distributed teams.
B00G725UZA|5.0|Songs and more songs.  With such a stretch of silence, those nine or ten lonely years, I'd welcome farts on snare drums if it meant there was more from The Next Day sessions that I could have in my home.  As it turns out, most of the seven tracks featured on the Extra EP are beyond farts, and are in fact actual songs that are just as enjoyable as the stuff from the parent album.  In one instance, God Bless The Girl, it surpasses the enjoyment - this may be my favourite Bowie song since I Would Be Your Slave.  Atomica sure is fun and the remix of Love Is Lost just goes on forever in the best way.  All the rock-isms are so care-free and buoyant, the vocals are better here than they've been on a Bowie release for quite some time, and I love the mix.  I believe that I'd honestly forgotten how much I love the sound of a bass guitar until I've heard it on a Bowie record, who's not been afraid to let the low-end dominate his mix in 2013.  Scattered as this review is, I really feel as strongly about this as I do The Next Day.  It's perfect!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game - I love it!!!  I recommend it for kids and adults both.  I play it with my grandson, and he hates if I get ahead of him!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I waited forever to start playing this and it's fun, addictive and maddening just like everyone said. I dIslike having to wait for more lives and really hope it doesn't start to annoy my fb friends with requests. If it does, I'll delete it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Good book, but not one of the best I have read. Some parts not realistic for what happened to him.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|this story is intense and fast paced. you never know who you can  trust..<br />Robie may have met his match
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was really good story! I recommend it to anyone who ever reads it! I love the story and how it's told!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It took a while for it to get on the kindle, but I'm glad it finally did. When it was really popular I wish it was on here then, but I still love it.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I love the fact that you can JUST watch the dance scenes. The plot is horrible but the half naked men dancing is amazing. So just avoid watching the whole movie. Go to the special features and select the dance scenes.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about the book it was awesome!it was the best book in the whole wide world!
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|It moved too slow and I actually never finished the film. I do not recommend this movie if you like fast paced action.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|This was very well written and acted.  It took elements of he Governor's character from Robert Kirkmans' Book, The Rise Of the Governor.  I know most people are all about the killing of the zombies and ALL about Daryl and Rick but this was a very important episode for the story line.  It is not all about zombies (don't get me wrong I do love my Daryl zombie kills) but its mainly the human interaction/survival/morals and survival during the dark times of this pandemic.<br /><br />Loved the episode and also if you have not read the 3 novels of the Governor by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga please do so they are an amazing and entertaining read.
6305127697|1.0|Terrible - cheaply made (TV broadcasters tell the story), unnecessary gore and absolutely no surprise. Richard Gere once again sleep walks through a role.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Best show ever. I love the aquarium with the walkers inside. I enjoy the special edition packages. Michonne's walkers are cool.
B00AAI7B7W|3.0|Too many scenes cut off. I have the DVD and there's a lot of editing in your version Amazon. Did not enjoy it as much.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This app is awesome if you comment back that it's a game not a app who really cares ? This app has grate GRAPHICS and high quality
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love Save Rock n Roll! This Cd Gives me hope that there is still new rock & roll to be herd! This is maybe my fav Cd buy for the year!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really enjoy playing this application, until recently. My game, which I had spent considerable time and money on, crashed!! Since your progress in the game is only saved on your device, when the game crashes &amp; has to be re-installed, you lose all of your progress and money!!! Customer service is supposed to restore the money and my level but I will have to recapture all the animals I had before. When my progress and money is restored I will raise my rating but if it happens again, the game will go down to 2 stars. The crashing of Gameloft applications seems par for the course, unfortunately!! I had this happen twice before on Oregon Trail: American Settler, which is another Gameloft app!! They really do need to work on these issues!! To be updated at a later time.....
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is probably one of her best if not her best CD. It's fantastic. The songs are very catchy and her voice has never sounded better. Great job Cher! I love it and listen to it all the time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great price and everything works great. I can control Netflix and Hulu + all from my phone. Play great quality and was really easy to setup. I also like the fact that with a plug-in I can even display web pages from Chrome browser on my TV.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I saw The Shining in 5th grade and read the book in 6th grade. The Shining still remains one of my favorite stories of all time. I loved revisiting Danny and his grown up life.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an excellent application for any Android tablet user.  The downloads and payment<br />system are streamline and work seamlessly.  I r eally enjoy using this application.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Great story. Easy read. Good for the soul. Recommend it. If you are looking for a weekend read, something easy, but with enough to pull your heart without being soppy, this is a great choice.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I love eminem, to the moon and back. This is just another one of his successes, it never gets old. Love him!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very well written with a good story line! Very human insights into lifes ups and downs! Will probably reread in a year or two!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book transports you to another world, and keeps you there.  It is the first book in a trilogy, and I have already pre-ordered the next. I read all 1007 pages in four days, and I was devastated when I reached the end. If you like sci-fi/fantasy at all, you will love this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of Kings best!! Very close to as good as the shining! Couldn't put it down! Read it in 3 evenings!
B002UWH8SS|3.0|Plot summary: Two goa'uld symbiotes take over BW and RCC and force them to create SGU to avenge the defeat the system lords suffered in SG1.  Well, not exactly, but it certainly a plausible explanation to what happened.<br /><br />If you liked SG1 and SGA, chances are you will not like SGU - the creators ( BW and RCC ) tried to do something \\"different\\" and it backfired.  SGU turned out to be a deficient hybrid of Stargate and Battlestar Galactica.  It had neither portrayal and analysis of social and psychological issues new BSG offered - and even if you disliked it, you have to admit that new BSG was smart and stylish - nor any meaningful Sci-Fi or humor present in SG1/SGA.<br /><br />SGU was a sad sad long dragged out show with sad unlikeable characters, which even the abundance of the gratuitous sex scenes could not save.  But good to know that some viewers liked the series to make it last two seasons.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelly is my favorite writer and Harry Bosch is the best. I have read all his books at least twice.  This was one of the better of Connelly's books.
6305657947|5.0|it's a wonderful movie - exciting, steamy, great actors, good plot!  Love the music and Faye Dunnaway's cameo appearance in the movie
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I haven't used this much yet but it appears to work very well. As an unpowered hub it has some limitations, won't charge all devices etc. but that's to be expected. I've been able to get it to work with all my devices so far. (Hint: if you have trouble with any device, make sure the hub and device are connected when you power up your PC). Even the packaging seems to be of very high quality. Very pleased so far and I can recommend this product.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's fun and easy to play. Doesn't take too much time but a nice little escape. My girls like to play and yet I as an adult also enjoy it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love it, and it works great with my kindle fire. I don't usually play games but this one so far is an exception.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of my son's favorite movies.  We all enjoyed watching it but he definitely did.  Loved all the different &#34;heroes&#34; that are in the movie.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I wouldn't have it. Consider before you buy this book.You can't even search for something at all. I wouldn't have it if I were you.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Great movie.  My son loved it and he enjoyed watching it.  He has watched it several times since I purchased it.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Just installed app, so I'll update my review once I use it a few times &amp; get a feel for it!!!
B004I654WQ|5.0|My daughter loved getting this movie.  She is a big Cars &#34;nut&#34; and has watched this movie over and over.  Thank you!!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Unique and fun. Easy to learn, but gets more difficult as you progress, like with all games. I like the fact that you can get help and not have to pay for answers or hints like some games. Only one help per hour, but that keeps you trying! Very frustrating in an addictive fun way! Good job.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|The best movie ever.  Love the romance, drama and action that this movie has in it.  Will always be one of my favorites.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Got this as a Free App of the Day a couple months ago and haven't put it down since. I was already familiar with the basic concept of the game (thanks, Nintendo), but using multiple colors was new to me. Luckily, it was easy to pick up.
B000002VMD|5.0|The Bodyguard has some of the best music ever.  Whitney Houston is a very talented singer.  Love these songs!!  Even my kids enjoy it.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|The book World War Z takes the reader into a realistic world that explores how humanity might face a real zombie apocalypse and the horrific things that mankind might do under pressure. In the film World War Z Brad Pitt fights a bunch of spooky zombies.<br /><br />Skip the video. Buy the book. (Available now on Amazon)!
B00003CY6M|3.0|Gave this movie as a gift.  Someone that I was in a relationship recommended this movie to me and I decided to give it away.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I highly recommend this app, it is a handheld game at its best - simple to play and understand, but challenging enough to become more difficult as you progress through the levels.  Basically you have to swap candy pieces to create rows of three or more of the same candy type, as you go along the game gives you different challenges in new levels such as scoring a certain amount of points in a time or move limit.<br /><br />This is the first game app I downloaded on my Kindle HDX 7&#34;, previously I played a lot of games on my iPad and iPhone.  The colors and sound on the Kindle HDX are great.  Some may complain about needing to buy levels past the first two, but new levels are only $0.99 and last a lot longer than four quarters did in an arcade in the 80's.  I think the pricing is more than fair.<br /><br />This is a time limit on the number of lives you have, which can be overridden by in-app purchases of extra lives (again $0.99).  There are also power-ups that can be purchased, though not necessary.  This is the only limitation of the game that can be a problem if you do not have access to a wireless network when you are playing.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I anxiously awaited this last installment of the dystopian series 'divergent' . I was looking forward to the movies coming out soon. Veronica Roth killed my love for the series by giving this last book a horrible ending. I'm sorry I ever read the series now. Some people have panned former divergent fans for feeling so intensely about the ending, but lets face it....americans in particular like happy endings. We are trained to think that if you work hard and do what's right things will somehow be ok. After all the tragedy in Tris and Four's world, was it too much to see them happy??
B008K9SG9K|5.0|i love this album. Imagine dragons are so great. ever since i was introduced to this band i loved them.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game. I have only played a few times. However, after playing, it would be good for a beginner since the difficulty of each puzzle seems to increase with the number of tiles played.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Play it on Facebook saw it in app store I had to get it.  Great game no issues so far
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This was a historical novel filled with the ups and downs you would expect but also so much more. I highly recommend it. A great book. Even better than The Kite Runner.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Even after shut down of my Kindle Fire HD the update just loops. &quot;You need an update to continue playing&quot; so I go to the appstore, tap on open, splash screen loads and says, &quot;You need an update to continue playing.&quot;
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Finally, a fresh look at Superman and his origins that is human, intelligent, and thought-provoking.  While Man of Steel is most definitely an action movie, and is in fact packed with action and special effects, the insightful look into Superman's origins and childhood give this movie even greater value.  Growing up as one who doesn't fit in, one who is different and all of the pressures that accompany that, gives this movie depth unlike any other version of the Superman legacy.<br /><br />Using a series of flashbacks, this movie delves into the origins of Superman and the destruction of Krypton, and the challenges that a boy of his background would face in modern society.  The script also speaks to how the world will react to learning that aliens exist; something taken for granted in past movies.  With all of this exposition, one would think that the storyline might be missing in the action department, but that's all wrong.  From an action perspective, this movie contains a LOT of activity and destruction, and with excellent special effects but without the unnecessary gore.<br /><br />In essence, this version of Superman finally considers emotion.  The relationship between Superman and Lois Lane is modernized, giving Lois a key role throughout the course of the script.  Henry Cavill's superman is thoughtful, intelligent, and emotive while lacking none of the characteristics that appeal to the action audience.<br /><br />I'm anxiously awaiting the next chapter in this series... I found no flaws in the film and would recommend it without reservation.  My hat's off to the cast and crew, well done!
B005DOKIYG|4.0|I wish there were more colors to chose from and a place for the kindle pen would really be nice.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|OK, I enjoy action movies to a degree, but those without a plot, or action for the sake of action, just annoy me.  I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but was quite pleasantly surprised to enjoy it from start to finish.  The film was well-acted throughout, with honest, emotive relationships among the characters, AND was filled with action and special effects.  Is White House Down plausible in reality?  I think not... but action films are developed to entertain, not to tell a cautionary tale.  Does the tale offer a political message?  Perhaps, but that's up to the viewer to evaluate.<br /><br />I found the film and its characters entertaining, well-acted and enjoyable.  It's well worth the investment of an evening's entertainment.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Didn't need both versions of songs that had guests on them. I actually prefer the guest vocal versions and removed the doubled ones.
B00EDJVP9Y|3.0|The music on this set is really great.  However, half the music is already on stuff most Allman fans already have that would buy a 7 (!) disc set like this.<br /><br />The sound is excellent and not compressed or brickwalled/loud, i.e. it has dynamics.  Whoever did the mastering did a good job!  There are a lot a gems in the tracks not already on ABB or the Anthology albums.  Great stuff!<br /><br />The packaging (on the second encore edition) was designed by idiots, which seems to be the course these days for the music industry as it declines.  Why irritate the people who actually buy CDs at a premium??<br /><br />$85 and they put the CDs in pockets???? Discs 1 and 6 are scratched. The pockets will scratch the discs on regular use. The only reason the other CDs were not, is that one needs to lift the discs away from the pocket (tight squeeze) to get them out. ONCE. Then into jewel cases.  Obviously, the guy who designed this didn't actually use it.  CDs are supposed to last a lifetime and do if you take care of them.<br /><br />This is the 5th box set (different titles) in a row that has come with scratched discs.  This is unacceptable!<br /><br />I'd rather have a box with separate jewel cases, and the book is non-standard size, what's the point?  They need to do it like Eric Clapton's first Crossroads issue - separate jewel cases and full size book. Most people who buy CDs today, prefer jewel cases.  Why do they keep irritating their customers?<br /><br />Hard slider box - pretty nice design. Actual quality was poor, with wrinkles and mismatched edges.  I'm guess most are not like this.<br />The book is excellent, although again, odd sized.<br /><br />The music is great and book content is good, but sometimes, I wonder if the music industry runs out of toes to shoot.<br /><br />BTW, the paper materials used in the CD pockets are not recyclable.  Jewel cases are.<br />Stop ripping us off with scratched discs!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The DVD came fast and prompt.  I was able to watch it in no time. Great Season!  Can't wait for the 4th season.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Works as described. Range is great and have to get behind a few walls before the connection starts to cut out. Use with my Onkyo TX-NR818.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Made finding files transferred to my Kindle a breeze and can't beat the price. Kindle should have this installed standard.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|“I am Malala” is an account of real life events. Books are not for people who think they know and understand everything already. They are not for people who present reviews on books without ever laying eyes on them let alone ponder over the author’s point of view. The book not only gives an insight into the social problems facing third world today but also what can happen if dogma is unleashed on normal people trying to live normal lives. It is a reminder to protect children from unquestionable beliefs and raise them as independent thinkers. Blind faith can be a very dangerous thing. Secular government and laws in democratic countries have produced the happiest and healthiest communities.  Creating heaven on earth may be a romantic idea but has proven disastrous generation after generation with basic human rights violations. The only allegiance we need is to the Earth, our only home so far and the only commitment we should have it to make this world better for coming generations. Everything else is unknowable at best. The book will stand as a part of documented history hundred years from now when the party small talks, the conspiracy theories, the short facebook comments will be annihilated by cruel hands of time.  (LM)
B004JP5DHW|4.0|Good movie, highlighting trials and challenges for those os us who are different, and difficulty others have understanding people who are different.
0446310786|5.0|When I had to read this book as a ninth grader, I found it tolerable, but I didn't really understand what all the hype was about. Rereading it 35 years later, I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the narrative. It is hard to verbalize but, beyond the book's important and universal message that good people must stand for justice no matter what pressures surround them in society, the author's words themselves evoke multiple layers of sensory experience and emotional responses that make the reading a significant, substantive, satisfying experience. I am not surprised that an author who wrote a book as perfect as this did not ever write another.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|He sings Italian melodies like a true Italian - he rolls the &#34;r&#34; in every piece and sings each piece like the love song it truly is.  His voice is warm and buttery.  He doesn't sing a word of English, but you know exactly what he is saying!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|This film was just to violent, and I did not like the UN-emotional character that Will Smith played. I had to leave the room and so did my son. We just are not into this type of movie
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|She is and has been since she began recording, my favorite singer.  Each song has original touches, each is &#34;told&#34; like a story, with the pauses needed to create the true meaning of the phrases.  Her voice is warm, tender, while capable of being strident in the same song, at the places it needs that quality.  She is not only a marvelous singer, she is par excellence as a song stylist.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladwell's &#34;David and Goliath...&#34; Shows us that a close analysis of ALL the facts can often turn our intuitive a priori assumptions upside down.<br /><br />In his usual spellbinding style of presenting statistical and factual analysis in the context of compelling and personal stories of fascinating and remarkable individuals, Gladwell helps us to learn some unrecognized and counterintuitive principles of how things really work in our world.<br /><br />So many interesting ideas and such good stories make this a hard book to put down. And one I was sad to finish so soon.<br /><br />I can't wait for his next one.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|i haven't played it yet but i can tell I'll. love it!!!!!<br />yes so awesome! you never. know. what. to expect! !!!!from this probably. cool game you know
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|An excellent story little related to The Shining and doesn't inspire as much fear as such - still loved it though!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Great Movie, love the music. Film is rather long but the special affects are fantastic. Received promptly after ordering at a great price.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Love John Grisham!!  This book was nearly as good as his very first one &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; which nobody would publish for years after he wrote it.  I read &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; at least 4 times and buy every book that comes out by John Grisham.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this case for almost a year and a half. It's proven to be a terrific buy -- and at such a reasonable price. Very simple, classic design that also protects the phone. I have a habit of dropping my phone. The subtle cover comes up just enough along the front of the phone to protect the glass when it falls or when it rests on a flat surface.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is great. Perfect functionality. Complete simple or complex math easily. I have it on my kindle fire. Kind of odd it didn't automatically have a calculator, but this app is perfect.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|A must see mind bender! This is a fantastic film. It's weird, sci-fi horror overtones will get under your skin and give you chills.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The descriptions were poetry.  'Shivering buildings','cardboard lips'.  This book is a masterpiece of both horror and hope.<br />I want my kids to read  it, but recommend it to all ages.
0451196716|5.0|One of his best ever.  Read it years ago and I had to buy it and re read it again.
0316789720|5.0|There are many easy to draw designs in here to jump start any imagination. I just love how simple these ideas are!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This version is better than the Facebook one also I like playing games on my tablet not so much my computer. The colors are vibrant the content is better and not so much wait time without doing anything.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Please, I liked Arcade Fire when they sold out and jumped the shark.  Arbitrary celebrity cameos have taken this band to the next level.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|I was sorely disappointed with this sequel, but I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because my husband liked it more than I did. I don't feel the story was interesting or compelling. It was confusing because it repeatedly flipped between the present time & his youth.<br /><br />While I love movies with lots of action, I found some of the fight scenes boring. Give me fight scenes like I see in Iron Man, Thor or the Bourne series. Now, THAT'S entertainment! I hope this movie doesn't kill off the new Superman franchise. Seems that the DC Comics superheroes don't have the same high-quality scripts and directors as those of Marvel Comics. Kind of a shame that they've wasted all that potential.
B00G32OER4|5.0|For me this was a educational movie based on real life events.  Not for the faint of heart.  God is real and so are his host of angels, Satan is real and his demons.  Only specially trained people should attempt this type of situation.  Other reality shows that show regular people going into haunted house are put these people at risk.  This is about a famous couple well trained in their area of expertise.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|It was a wonderful movie. Entertaining and fun. We have no children and are in our mid-60s, yet the movie kept us interested.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm hoping that this item improves and meets its full potential. At the moment it doesn't support as many applications as it could. For instance, Amazon Instant does NOT work because it uses Microsoft Silverlight, which for one reason or another doesn't stream to the television. Unfortunately I didn't find this out until right before I tried to start a movie.<br /><br />Netflix works pretty well. Streaming from a browser tab can be laggy. There's a delay between what happens on the computer and on the TV. Also, it's nice that you can &#34;cast&#34; a tab, and then use other tabs on your computer, but you can't make the cast tab full-screen if you want to switch to other tabs. So if you want to multitask (or say allow someone to watch a movie while you use your computer) then they would be forced to watch it in its embedded state (not full-screen).<br /><br />Like I said - I think this product has enormous potential. I'm sure there are a lot of ropes and hoops they have to jump through so they don't encroach on property rights and stuff like that. Hopefully it continues to improve. It would be a great value for the price.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  The graphics were fantastic and beautiful.  The mini-games were pretty easy and there were a lot of them.  I've played their other games; this is right on par with them.  For a buck it was a nice way to spend down-time in the afternoon.<br />Thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game but hate that there are limited lives and I am NOT ready to quit when the game runs out of lives!!!
0670451495|5.0|As with other books by this same author, I read it to my children.  As a Boston native, it is a classic as far as I'm concerned. Fine writer; delightful illustsrations
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Pretty cute story line, introduced some interesting characters, and just touch on some of Rose's talent. Guess they'll expand in the next one. Good read that flowed well.
B000A0K2JO|5.0|Who needs a PS/2 adapter these days? This guy!  I have a MAME arcade system that uses a PS/2 connection. Having only USB keyboards I needed  this adapter to make the connection.  It does exactly what it was intended for even if a PS/2 keyboards are hard to come by these days.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of our families favorite movies! It instantly became a classic for us and will certainly remain so for years to come. If you are looking for a great family movie that can be watched by all ages, this is it. Very well done, great acting, great story, and an incredible message. I highly, highly recommend that you add this to your movie collection.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|If you love music and have a home theater then this is a must have Blu-ray.  Great footage and the neon bracelets are incredible on my 130'' home theater screen.  You won't be disappointed.  I have watched this a few times already and I use it to demo my system.  Visual masterpiece and sound-gasm worthy.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love this game. It really passes the time for me.  I really enjoy games like this!!! Everyone play and add me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It reminds me of a game I like to play at Dave and Busters.  I can't wait until I get more coins - wake up in the wee hours of the morning playing this game.<br /><br />One of my favorite games to play!!!
B001DUGOWY|3.0|Steinbeck is one of the greatest writers I have ever read, and this is the worst book I have read by him. Still great, but fails to come through in the end.
0062255657|5.0|I love Neil Gaiman's work both for kids and adults.  It was a wonderful read, and made me think about being a kid again.  I loved reading this book.
B00F5PS5P2|3.0|If you like techno or electronica music it's good. Nothing really too groundbreaking or anything, but it's okay to listen to.
B00ADQPB50|3.0|This one was not as good as the first.  It was still good and spooky and weird in the way that only American Horror Story can be, but it just wasn't as good to me as the first.
B00DKEN3KC|5.0|Great Timing!<br />The movie came brand new. It came within 3 days.  The packaging was decent. I watched it right away and movie played all the way through. And it was entertaining. Thank you again you all did a great job!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This series is a total mind warp, but it's also like a car wreck.....you can't stop watching.  LOVE this season, and So glad that I bought the whole season so that I could watch them one after another!
0345529057|5.0|A master piece. The words, the politics, the blood thirst and the hunger for preserving your family names and your family legacy alive keep you on your toes. There's no word to describe it. You just have to read it to understand what I'm talking about.
0321934946|5.0|Easy to understand.  The author threw in a little humor which made the reading much more enjoyable. Will probably purchase the next two editions.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|At first I had trouble figuring it out. I found their website and looked at the free blog they offer. Once I read just a few explanations I caught on &amp; have really been enjoying it. I did purchase the full version. It is a little repetitive because you have to go back to the same places but you are doing that to find or unlock new things. I would recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very Cool graphics and easy to figure out. This game should provide many hours of fun for many different people!
B003B02O3C|5.0|This is one of the best Grisham books ever and would make great movie.  You have one main and two sub plots,  legal shenanigans and land a large cup of outrage at the insurance companies
0804137501|4.0|Like their previous effort, Rework, Remote is short, sharp and eschews lengthy management book pontification in favor of to-the-point ideas and examples. As a book, it's very much an illustration of how Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson have built their company, 37signals, into the success it demonstrably is; absent of anything not necessary.<br /><br />Reading Remote, I was reminded often of the kind of culture espoused in Rework, and felt Remote makes a fine companion to it. While both are eminently readable on their own, they make a great pair together, espousing a view on 21st Century business and how things should be done (I should say ought, but that would be a cop out, as I believe the authors are absolutely right in their views).<br /><br />If you want to explore remote working for yourself or your staff, you're well advised to read Remote to avoid the pitfalls common in doing it badly, and for some sage advice on how to get it right and the necessary corporate culture shift that comes along with it.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|It gave me a better appreciation of the ability to cooperate and bury the hatchet after contentious presidential campaigns. It brought home the unique experience of the office only to be understood by a former president.
0316204366|5.0|Another great book from Gladwell that makes you rethink conventional wisdom. It makes you think of the many ways you could apply similar thinking for small companies to beat large companies by changing the game.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|The funniest series I've seen and just started watching this by accident over a month ago. Caught a rerun on television and I've been hooked ever since.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|It works better than other options, but the sound is a little &#34;distant&#34; which makes it seem harder to understand - for TV listening.  It does pretty well for personal conversations.  It doesn't cause as much static/interference when passing the mic to different speakers as other tested units.
B003L77G06|5.0|Modern Family is so much like whats going on today in the real world. I can relate to each family in the show. HILARIOUS!!!!!! Phil, Luke and Cameron are total riots.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I've seen five other versions of the Christmas Carol including: The Muppets, George C. Scott, Mickey's Christmas Carol, one with a London Humbug, and Mr. Magoo's version.<br /><br />The reason for my rating on this one: 1 star for animation. 1 star for voice acting. -3 stars for the scary images.<br /><br />I felt like I was walking through Transylvania at Christmas time. I've never been a fan of creepy things and this reminded me why.<br /><br />Major Spoilers below:<br /><br />It opens with Marley laying in his coffin. I felt that was a new way to do it, but I've got to admit, I hated it. The last thing I want to do is look at a dead man. I didn't mind Scrooge going through the streets and seeing how others avoided him. But once the ghost of Marley entered the scene, rolled his eyeballs around in his skull and flapped his ripped jaw, I was feeling freaked out. My first thought was: I'm never letting my kids see this movie!<br /><br />When we get to the ghost of C. Past I was surprised to see a ghost that resembled a candle stick. When he spoke, he sounded like a hissing flame. I couldn't see his face very well (granted he was fire, but still I wanted to see more definition). I didn't like him.<br /><br />C. Present started out well enough, I liked his throaty laugh. But his &#34;end&#34; was too much for me. I always preferred the fading out, shine, or sparkle effect to let the viewers know he was leaving. In this one he literally has a heart attack and DIES! He becomes a laughing skeleton! O_O!!! Then Ignorance and Want (the kids under the robes) spring up and turn into a knifing thug who's caged and then a prostitute who gets straight-jacketed and drug off screaming into the dark. If I'd been a kid, I would've ducked behind a couch!<br /><br />C. Future. He was the one I expected to be scary and I definitely wasn't disappointed. But the carriage chase scene...not needed. I'm pretty sure they only stuck it in for the 3D thing they were doing at the theaters.<br /><br />Overall, there wasn't enough of that warmth or happiness that you get in the other films when you watch the Crachetts, Nephew Fred, or the Fezzwigs celebrate their Christmases. I needed more of the family love and kindness, the joyful feel of celebration going on in order to care about them. Instead, I found myself very distanced in order to be mentally shielded from any another deteriorating ghost that might pop up in the movie. I couldn't even get a feel for Tiny-Tim. I felt for Bob when he went up the stairs, but that's about it.<br /><br />There were three swears during the film, not needed.<br /><br />When Scrooge came to himself, I was happy the film was nearly at it's end. When it was over, my mind was still reeling over the laughing skull of Christmas Present. I couldn't get that terrifying image out of my head.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this kind of game. Once you start it, it's hard to put it down. All the interesting hidden areas make for a great game.
0312330537|5.0|Just a fantastic story.  I'm sure the author embellishes some parts of the story, but if you can suspend that feeling the rest of the book is just a beautiful journey across decades of changes in southeast Asia and the middle east.  It opens new worlds outside of the traditional western mold.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|cant stop playingn great for passing the time!! however needs things not to cost so much to get and more tracks
0810970686|5.0|Very funny and entertaining book i loved it very very much a great overall book and a great sequal, good book
B006LXQID8|5.0|great sweet unique story. i was confused the first time watching it. Had to watch it a 2nd time. &#60;3
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works well for daily use I have been using for about a year now only had it freeze once on snooze that I recall.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very nice not at all boring. Good for all ages and hard to win sometimes but that's good for solitaire.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I truly LOVED this book. The experiments are fun and nearly all of them worked for me. It is thoughtfully written in an easy to understand style. I liked how each chapter concludes with an experiment you can use to test what you just learned. I absolutely loved the stories and was mesmerized by some as I couldn't guess who the person was. I am left with a great appreciation for the power of my thoughts and questioning what I was taught as a child. Now when things seem rough I reach out the FP and request what I want. It has never failed me.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire because I love writing fan fiction, and it works great! The different notebooks keep everything organized and the covers/titles you can put on the books help me know which book I'm using. Over all, it's an amazing app and I would definitely recommend to any aspiring author or someone who needs to organize they're notes!
B00FQ272ZI|4.0|A profound work of art, capturing the essence of extreme misfortune and brutal survival, \\"All Is Lost\\" is a magnificent work. Robert Redford, who has starred in a number of high and low-end budget films throughout his extensive career, really put out his a-game in this \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" type of story. I felt as if I was reading a good book, anticipating the horrors of being lost at sea all alone and at the same time hopefully expectant that Redford would survive such a terrible situation.<br /><br />I am not a sailor nor will I ever be, but through the attention to detail and great directing by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call) I was able to feel like I was on the boat with Redford, experiencing and feeling the same thing he experienced and felt. I was drawn from my seat out into the sea and I even felt the impending doom that all was lost.<br /><br />However, partly due to lack of dialogue and the slow pace of the story, it was easy to see why many people from the general public would dislike this film. Besides two brutal storms and the foreseen shark infestation below Redford's raft, the story was slow and evenly paced, giving the viewer the opportunity to live in Redford's shoes and feel what he was feeling. You need to take the film for what it is worth - a simple and minimalist narrative about a man lost at sea. With that in mind, you can really pull a lot out of the story and enjoy it just as much as if you were reading a short book.<br />(As seen on [...]
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great short book, easy to read and fun. Presents in a simple way the Life work of tesla. Recommended read.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The party only really ends when the woman of your dreams becomes your reality.  \\"The Great Gatsby\\" centers on the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and illustrious man who throws extravagant parties and who has a sort of mystique set to his name - nobody really knowing his past nor where his fame and wealth truly came from. It is the mysterious past of Jay Gatsby that drives the film forward and what keeps the audience in dazed wonderment as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In Fitzgerald's own words from the novel, \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" The film \\"The Great Gatsby\\" has been one of many representations of the novel, each one having different feels and imagery, but in my humble opinion this has been the best. The depiction of society gave me the impression of an exciting lifestyle marked by a rapidly growing market and degradation through cheap alcohol. Society, at the time, couldn't have seemed more alive and booming. It is through this period that the story of the great Gatsby is revealed.<br /><br />The novel, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was written in the year 1925 and soon became a legacy, an inspiration, a novel of great value. It centers on idealism, resistance to change, change being an enemy unto mankind, as well as the american dream that \\"we can have it all.\\" It paints a vivid picture of the 'roaring 20s' and the beautiful jazz age in the great Big Apple. This picturesque period is the subject of many novels and films, having no shortage of unique stories and myths.<br /><br />Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton, and the beautiful Carey Mulligan, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is a colorful and intriguing take on the novel. The film was directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia), who is well known for his use of bright colors and fast-paced editing. He created a visual symphony to represent this thrilling story of love and riches, but, unfortunately, Luhrmann's distinctivetaste has made the film subject to some negative reviews as well as low numbers in theaters.<br /><br />But can I say the same as those film critics who claim that the film is too flashy or too contemporary for a fictional story based in the 1920s? No. To me, the story was told as it should have been told to audiences of today. The actors generated personalities similar to that which is found in the novel, the story was gripping and told by the character named Nick Carraway as it is also done in the novel, and the imagery and symbolism was portrayed just as it was to be imagined. A novel of such caliber deserves to be visually told excitedly and thoroughly and should not suffer from lack of imagination.<br />(As seen on [...] created by me!)

B00C0K6NUY|4.0|The second book following the career of Detective Inspector Kate McGuire. It's a tough and an uncomfortable read as at times it involves repeated scenes of castration (ouch!)The story revolves around the creation of a &#34;choir of Castrati&#34; and as this suggest involves sexual and physical abuse. A number of priests are disappearing soon to be found horribly mutilated, all evidence points to an abuse of power and privilege within the church. The action is fast, the storyline never falters, and all this set against Kate's personal life which is fast disintegrating. I actually preferred book one in the series &#34;White Bones&#34; (originally released as A Terrible Beauty) but both are great reads by the master of horror Graham Masterton turning his talents to gritty crime writing...I look forward to no.3 in the series.
1476733953|5.0|Six stars! O wait...there's only five. Rats.  This deserves six.  I am not always a sci-fi fan but this rates as a classic. Not a sci-fi classic. A classic overall. Some sci-fi does not develop the characters...not so here. Each piece of the prose takes on life and you meet the characters and their world on their turf.<br /><br />I am ashamed to say I bought this one year ago and kept putting off reading it because it looked long. My loss. Once I started I had to plow through all five. Each chapter building a new question. This is an incredible work of fiction from beginning to end. Or is it the end?  This story could go on for a long long time. Oh...I sure hope so.  Masterful writing. The characters live in your head.  Ok...enough gushing.  This is just a downright good book.<br /><br />Bravo Mr. Howey.  More...more! Encore!! Oh yeah...and when does the movie come out?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it... its fun and challenging!  I'm addicted for sure! if you haven't tried it you really really should!
B003Y5D776|5.0|Received it in 3 days, hooked it up and it worked perfect, My computer recognized it as being a sound card. Ran my radio delay program through it and did away with TV announcers and listen to radio announcers.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Love the game. I just wish it had Stampede Mode that you could play without it requiring energy like in Deer Hunter Reloaded.
B00AEDDSTI|5.0|Loved it. Reminds me of Lord of the Flies in a sense. No hope for humanity. Represents how screwed mankind really is.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book, did not know there really was an Orphan Train.  Confirms that if you believe in yourself and never give up anything can happens.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|The movie was incredible and left you in suspense the entire movie.  An excellent cast of characters and everything put together I can't say enough about the film.  If you ask me they left the ending open for another sequel down the road possibly.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This is by far the best farm game I have found to date and I have played nearly all of them. From Farm Story to Zombie Farm and this is the best choice for a mobile farm game. I just started playing on my galaxy S please add FATIATQ
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|This story is simply incredible.  Based on a amazon search this is Ann Leckie's first published novel.  A few anthologies and non fiction works come up but only Ancillary justice as a full length novel.  This novel is so well crafted that I cant believe this is her first.  It strongly reminds me of the Culture novels of Ian M. Banks but is much more approachable.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in Sci-Fi except action fanatics.  If you are more interested in explosions than character and world development you will find the action sequences few and far between.  The story is a little disjointed at the begining switching back and forth between to time periods.  After a few chapters you cant wait to see how it comes together.  The ending is possibly a little anticlimactic but given the universe shown in the novel very believable.  It leaves enough open for possible sequels without leaving you hanging.  As in life not every character ends up happy but has to live with the situation as it is.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really regret reading this series and recommending it to others; Allegiant was such a huge disappointment and for so many different reasons.  I could not believe for a second that Four's mother would so easily change her mind about everything she had gone to war over upon his simple request! And the way it all ended for Tris, horrible!  I really hated this book!  One star is one too many.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Big Fish games.  I am so happy that I can now play it on my Kindle.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good app works well with my kindle fire. The price is right for the amount of time I use it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am playing on my Kindle Fire HD and  love it. The screen is bigger than my cell phone. I don't like that some items take a long time to make and that it's hard to upgrade the warehouse. I think some missions shouldn't take so long to complete. I play on facebook an  like this version because I don't have to bother my friends with tons of request for items.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great, like how you can choose another weapon over what is suggested. Still getting used to aiming at multiple targets.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get it is awesome  you can build anything!<br />I found tones of diamonds ans iron!<br />I built a city as big as a map a huge trollface!<br />Todd job Mojang!! Thanks for the awesome game!

B000056HE9|5.0|CLASSIC that I don't celebrate Christmas without !<br />A time when movies were about values and entertainment.<br />Love Cary Grant and the beautiful Loretta Young together.<br /><br />The whole family can watch this one.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|This game like most games on my tablet are for killing time.  To that end it is a good game.  It could be a bit better if you controlled when you fight, as opposed to the game.

B000FQIRXQ|5.0|This is a delightful classic film. It is very long but I wouldn't cut a single minute. The funny, sad, cruel,  sentimental and melodramatic world of Charles Dickens. More than half of the story takes place in David's  childhood, so the role for Daniel Radcliffe is a major one and he is terrific  - this was made before he got his starring role in Harry Potter. He is tiny and cute. The scene where he bites the vile Mr Murdstone who is thrashing him is very exciting. It seems a bit odd that he doesn't grow at all for the first five years, then suddenly turns into a man, but that's boys for you. Maggie Smith is in her element as Aunt Betsy Trotwood, and Bob Hoskins is a natural as Mr Micawber (Something will turn up...). Nicholas Lyndhurst is outstanding as the creepy, hypocritical Uriah Heep. The film is full of lovely cameo roles, for instance Dawn French as the drunken Mrs Crupp. The only part that didn't really cut it for me was Steerforth  - and didn't Emily die in the original book? The costumes, settings and interiors are all chosen with an exquisite eye and give pleasure from first to last.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Hi still cannot download a textbook because my new kindle fire doesn't have the latest Adobe flash player 11.2 and I have wasted an hour trying to download it, and still unsuccessful!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Stunning flight scenes, The real story, though, is about a man coming to grips with alcoholism. Some scenes and language unnecessarily gross. Predictable ending.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Ordered this for our adult son.  My husband and I watched it and it scared the be-jeeber out of us!
B003JUGQ38|3.0|We only watched one episode. Forgot the title, but it was about a group of people trapped in a space ship near a hostile environment planet. Good acting to get a full episode out of an hour of shouting and shifting allegiances.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I have been a fan of Grisham forever. I have read everyone of his books. And about 90%  are pure gold. I can understand it must be hard coming up with new material and that is my problem with this book. I knew how it was going to end about half way thru but still it was a good book and I am glad I read it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was not as compelling as A Time to Kill, but I liked the story of standing up for the little guy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really excited when Chromecast came out.  The problem is they have not expanded support beyond Netflix, YouTube, Google Music, and Google TV.  It is now sat unused for the past 3 months.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|This was a good action film with happy and sad scenes.  Del Toro's movies are always entertaining.  I'm glad I bought the DVD to watch again from time to time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the period costumes, the ultra rich and the way they live.<br />The scenery is simply great, love all the cast members
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I'm not really one for sappy romance so I wish there had been a little more wolf stuff in it but I was really intrigued with the wolf mythology. I'll be reading the other two.
0061900656|5.0|This book is fantastic for a new baby! Unlike a lot of the other &#34;new sibling&#34; books, this one doesn't mention any negative feelings towards the baby (e.g., &#34;Can we take him back?&#34; and &#34;I feel left out now the new baby's here&#34;) and focuses instead on the positives (&#34;I ask mama before I hold the baby&#34; and &#34;I can help giving the baby a bottle&#34;). It also emphasizes how the big brother can do things the little baby cannot and how the parents still love the big brother even though the new baby's here.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|While this was an enjoyable movie, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first two. It was OK.
0553593714|1.0|This book is so bad that I don't even want to donate to a library, or recommend anyone read it.<br />If you are looking for fairies and magical worlds that describe goodness and light this is not the book for you.<br />I read the first 50 pages and left it with a sad feeling.  Within that short time of 50 pages there is horrific violence, slavery, subjugation of women, and allusions to incest.  Not a happy or healthy story.<br />I never want to throw books out, but this may be an exception.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game has several puzzles.  The first ones were so simple, I guessed the others would be monotonous. Wrong! The puzzles were intriguing, and challenged the common senses.  Didn't get bored even upon replay.  I decided to buy the full version after playing the free version... it was a small cost for big fun.
0001857010|5.0|The illustrations in this book are so captivating. I read these books growing up and this was definitely the closest anything has ever come to the way I always envisioned the story!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game that is challenging.  I keep trying over and over to beat certain levels. I would like more than five lives sometimes.

B001AGXEA6|5.0|Beetlejuice is a movie that I grew up watching and loving for decades. It is a great marker of what can be done entertainment wise without CG or a huge Hollywood budget.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Brilliant and bears infinite,repeated listens......<br /><br />I can't get enough of this album.The seventies Jethro Tull albums are indeed the best...
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I would have to definitely say that this book is the worst of the three. The only reason why I completed it is because I was very interested in knowing how it ended. I was tempted often to just skip to the end to find out what happened but I did complete the book and I was disappointed in this one. Although I enjoyed the series as a whole because the first two books were fantastic, I feel this book should have been better.
B00FPH6PRK|2.0|Streaming was horrible, impossible to watch, checked my connection and my network was fine. I tried netflix and streaming was flawless. Amazon must look into upgrading steaming, iron man 3 streamed perfectly on amazon, I don't know why it would only be this movie.

081099741X|5.0|I’m a HUGE Wes Anderson fan and have reveled in his entire oeuvre – including commercials. So it was a “no-brainer” for me to purchase this lovely and luscious book, “The Wes Anderson Collection” by Matt Zoller Seitz.  Seitz says this book is for “detail-obsessed fetishists” and I guess that describes me!<br /><br />When it arrived I flipped quickly through it looking at the pictures. It’s a scrap-book of sorts for Wes’ seven films: “Bottle Rocket” through “Moonrise Kingdom” (a new film, “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, comes out in 2014). I was thrilled with all the pictures and colorful illustrations because what most of us Wes Anderson fans love about his work is the way his movies LOOK. Part of his style is his incredible attention to detail – every single prop or costume is meticulously chosen.<br /><br />Then I sat down to READ the book because it contains a long conversation between Seitz and Anderson about his films starting with “Bottle Rocket”. Well, I just totally “GEEKED OUT” and realized that I need to re-watch each movie and then read the corresponding interview and look at the photos and story-boards and frame shots. So that’s what I’m doing. Wes Anderson’s films are imminently re-watchable and this book just ups the ante for enjoyment and “insider” information.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book (and it’s a BARGAIN for a coffee table quality book!) to Anderson fans or anyone who revels in reading about great writer/directors. Everything about his work is unique: the look, the sound (don’t even get me started on his wonderful soundtracks!), the HUMOR, the pace, the tone, the pathos…well, you get my drift: I love this book ALMOST as much as I love Wes Anderson’s films.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|It's OK album but I don't get why that many 5 stars? Just thinking, if this is a debut album of some new band probably wouldn't have more than 3+. Since it's Sir Paul ...
1451666179|5.0|“Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem and Other Things That Happened&#34;, by Allie Brosh, is a collection of illustrated tales from her very popular blog, “Hyperbole and a Half”, with some new material added. I started reading the blog several years ago and immediately loved the quirky drawings and the unique sense of humor, and I was sad and concerned when Brosh seemed to disappear for many months to deal with severe depression, which she also wrote about and is included in this book. It’s so good to have her back and it was very generous of her to share her story.<br /><br />But don’t despair that this book is filled with sadness and depression: it’s a HOOT! Bosh is a genius at being both self-aggrandizing and self-deprecating at the same time! She makes you want to pick her up (or her childishly-drawn little alter-ego with the strange yellow triangle “pony-tail”), and give her a big hug.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Bought this for my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 the sound quality and output on this little amplifier is really amazing, it pushes so much power into my headphones that I can't listen to them at full power.<br /><br />The only drawback is when you plug this into an active USB port, IE a computer to charge, you will hear a lot of background electrical noise from the computer.  Plugged directly into a wall charger it is silent but plugged into a computer it makes a bunch of noise.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|The Game would never load.  Downloaded and installed this on a Samsung Galaxy 3 tablet.  Clicking on the icon brought up the BigFish Logo and one other company logo, but then returned me to the Amazon App Store Website.  Ended up deleting the app. I'm not really rating how the game plays as I wasn't able to get to that point.
0345803485|5.0|I didn't realize that when I bought this book for my wife that it would benefit me in so many ways, this book has a lot of raunchy x rated stuff in it that got my wife all turned on, she wanted to try a lot of what she read which got a big two thumbs up for me.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Not a big reviewer of music, so I'll keep this simple. I really enjoy this album. I listened to it five times in the first 24 hours. It's all over the place stylistically. Some of it resembles her older work. There are some slower songs reminiscent of Goodbye Lullaby. There's a much harder rock song with Marilyn Manson called &#34;Bad Girl&#34; which might be my favorite. There's this Asian culture-inspired &#34;Hello Kitty&#34; which is the most unique piece on the album and a fun song. It's a very enjoyable album and it's great to see Avril experimenting with several styles. I loved Goodbye Lullaby when others didn't, but as where as that was a very consistent album, this one shows all that Avril is capable of and her ability to grow as a musician. Yet, throughout the album, I never get the sense she's trying to be someone else. In it's diversity, it is still familiar.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|The quality of the HD was good and naturally the show was good as well, I would recommend this HD version of the SD any day of the week.

B000DN5W4I|5.0|I cannot tell you how good this is in this little review box. You can't box in Bonamassa! If you like Guitar Driven Rock, Blues, Blues Rock, Jazz - all from a very young guy who not only writes his lyrics but also his music and it's actually good - you want this.This guy is the most under-rated musician you have never heard of. When you hear this (hopefully through real speakers - not amped up bass boosters from hell)  you will hear music - like it's the first time.

1476729085|5.0|Don Tillman is an outlier and an outsider, due to both his extremely high intelligence and extreme lack of social skills. He has emotions, but can’t seem to manage or express them. He’s never gotten beyond the first date with a woman. At the beginning of the book Don has exactly two friends, fellow college professor Gene and his psychologist wife, Claudia. And yet, Don is also a good egg, a pussycat, a mensch, and a master of the deadpan one-liner (if unintentionally). He’s not traditional leading man material at all--but I was laughing out loud by page two and smitten with him not long after. How can you resist a man who is such a sweet and loyal friend to an elderly neighbor like Daphne? He’s even taken the time to figure out the most humane killing method for the lobsters he has for dinner every week. He really does want to do the right thing; it just doesn’t always work out well.<br /><br />Although dating has been disastrous for him in the past, Don still has hopes that he can find a wife. He hatches a plan to find his perfect match through a questionnaire of his own design, but then Rosie comes along and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />I’m not going to use the “A” word to describe our Don, because he’s never been labeled with an official diagnosis, and I think he’s better off without it. One of the deeper messages in this book is that it’s not pleasant to be pigeon-holed, whether it’s due to gender, birthplace, body size, education level, or a so-called disability. Part of Don’s own journey is learning how to overlook labels and appreciate other people as individuals, as he would like to be. This is more than your run of the mill romantic comedy; highly recommended.
B000002L3P|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd is who I found after Joe Bonamassa. I don't know who came first but I likes 'em both. This is indescribable music. It's guitar, it's blues, it's great songwriting. There really aren't any bad songs on his albums. Even the &#34;Bad&#34; or &#34;throwaways&#34; are 100 times better than most people's best. There comes a time when the crap on the radio actually becomes crap and then you find these guys and your belief in really good music  is renewed.

I'm not a religious person but I know Tommi believes in God (contrary to popular belief) and he needs them now more than ever. We already lost Ronny Jame Dio - too soon and Tommy's sound started ALL this Heavy Metal that we ALL enjoy so much - remember that!

Neil Peart's technicality and precision behind the drum kit along with his lyrical wrighting style are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what Rush bring to the table.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I cannot tell you how good this is in this little review box. You can't box in Bonamassa! If you like Guitar Driven Rock, Blues, Blues Rock, Jazz - all from a very young guy who not only writes his lyrics but also his music and it's actually good - you want this.This guy is the most under-rated musician you have never heard of. When you hear this (hopefully through real speakers - not amped up bass boosters from hell)  you will hear music - like it's the first time. I accidentally found him and bought 2 CDs.<br />Then I went to a used CD shop and bought the rest of his entire catalog (new & unopened) including the 2 CDs with Beth Hart and his first rock band's CD and his other pet project Rock Candy Funk Party. Then I found the DVD concerts and then the blu rays concerts. I'm tellin' you &#34;Get up off-a that thing&#34;.........and buy ALL OF IT. You WILL thank me.....
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This album is spectacular, The Way The Wind Blows, Far Cry, The Main Monkey Buisness, and Workin Them Angels are a perfect example of just how far Rush have come from the days of Workin Man, Finding My Way, when people thought they were Led Zeppelin knock-off's and the days of Time Stand Still, and Subdivisions when the music was keyboard driven with ragae influence would  sneak in on a few songs. Alex Lifeson really shines on this album playing the Mandolin, 12 string acoustic guitar, as well as backing vocals here and there, his guitar work on this album is the best of his career, The Main Monkey Buisness is proof of that.  Geddy Lee has found a style that allows him to play complex patterns while singing, his talent ranks among the likes of Cliff Burton as the greatest bass players in Rock n Roll History.
B000002L5I|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd is who I found after Joe Bonamassa. I don't know who came first but I likes 'em both. This is indescribable music. It's guitar, it's blues, it's great songwriting. There really aren't any bad songs on his albums. Even the &#34;Bad&#34; or &#34;throwaways&#34; are 100 times better than most people's best. There comes a time when the crap on the radio actually becomes crap and then you find these guys and your belief in really good music  is renewed.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Amazing game.like it. Try the game and you will see that this game is great but you need yo try it. I was surprised by it

B000E9910W|4.0|This album has got them all. Every single hit and famous song they have released is in there. All the herbs and spices are in there! The sound is great and well mastered. This selection at this price can only be found on Amazon. Only if they would have excluded Michael McDonald’s stuff and continue to stick with Rock!<br /><br />Aside Michael McDonald’s songs which are Lollypop Pop songs made for desperate house wives, the rest of the album is well made Southern Rock and Classic Rock.<br /><br />Overall this album is well put together and got it all.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot of fun and kills a lot of time.  The game is better than on pc or even phone.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|An outstanding novel for anyone who enjoys the natural world, science or just life in the 19th century!  Well written.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|After the first recording sound became scratchy and UN audible on every recording thereafter. Definitely not a good four dollars spent.

B00BATWJFE|3.0|This book is good movie making material. If you want a light hearted, enjoyable, well written book then this is it. Perfect for reading in the park or on the beach.
0141394811|5.0|This book reads exactly like you would want/expect an autobiography from the Might Moz to read. I admit the &#34; whole world is against me&#34;-a-thon can get a little old,but for the most part it's a highly enjoyable book. My musical tastes ( New York Dolls,Sparks,Mott The Hoople,Roxy Music) are very similar to Morrissey's so I can totally relate to the excitement of discovering these artists and they all left a big impression on our young Steven Patrick here. It's a fairly quick read even at this length because once you get started it's difficult to put down. I found the Mike Joyce vs. Morrissey court room section and the ghost sighting on the Moors ( seriously ) to be  among my favorite stories but really the book has so many high points it's difficult to pick out merely a few. Morrissey is one of those artists that very few people are on the fence about. You either love the guy or loathe him and I suspect the public will feel the same way about his writing here. If the powers that be in Hollywood are not lining up to option this thing into a movie then I will be very surprised. Easily one of the best  autobiographies I've ever read. Great job Moz.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love these games...this one is great! The quest are non stop, you get to multi task quests and build...of course it doesn't hurt that I love the fantasy/fairytale theme.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I was so excited after I watched this movie that I couldn't even sleep that night. I loved the original Bourne movies, but this one tops them.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Like Star Trek Nemesis where Picard's clone Shinzon, an exact genetic copy but different life experiences, makes different decisions, Lost in Austen reveals the different outcome for Elizabeth Bennet given her different experiences in the 21st century. In contrast, Amanda Price the contemporary 26 year old brings her 21st century sensibility into the restrained Georgian environment, shaking it up considerably. Amusing gaiety ensues.    Lost in Austen is satire retaining the emotional music of Jane Austen's language by borrowing speeches freely from Austen novels and prayers [[ASIN:B005GRF3QI Jane Austen Collection: 18 Works, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Love and Friendship, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Lady Susan, Mansfield Park & more!]], minor works, Austen's personal biography, and cinematic parodies [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000HEWEE4 The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B007L5LD9O Emma]], [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]] and versions of Austen novels combined in a 4 part BBC series edited in the US DVD into a 3 hour compressed version. The writer was able to create a hilarious mix stirring together archaic British grammar and contemporary slang.    The gemische is spiced up with symbolism, twisted plot lines, and unexpected character developments eg perversions in Zeal of the Lord Collins, the generous honorable side of womanizer Wickham, sneaky 15 year old Georgiana, the perceptive Lady Catherine de Bourgh. And new characters born of Elizabeth's comment \\"I may be fortunate enough to meet another Mr Collins!\\" All the characters are richly women and more three dimensional than the 1995 version [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E Miniseries)]] with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth which is referenced repeatedly throughout the movie. Lost in Austen is reminiscent of [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]] compared with Star Trek, including drinking, profanity, humiliation, missteps,and all sorts of crudity.    Familiar speeches from Austen books and movies weave sparkles into the appreciation for this farce.    Some viewers could not believe that Amanda Price could be an Austen fan and yet not fit into the Georgian period more smoothly. I enjoy reading Asian novels, however the reality of living in ryokan finds my tatami cluttered with suitcases, clothes, toiletry paraphernalia, my voice unacceptably loud, grammar not predictably gracious enough, clothes not appropriately combined and draped, my legs too stiff for sitting without central heat or central plumbing. It takes a while to fit in, and adapt to the lack of toileting and bathing facilities, the bias against women speaking, and unfamiliarity of finding oneself in another culture. Amanda Price took a while to find her feet in Georgian England as well given her upbringing in Hammersmith, a formerly industrial region, and her spunk.    5 star enjoyable romp. I compiled the following list to help with comprehension.    Lost in Austen glossary and trivia  Pride and Prejudice published 1813 by Jane Austen 1775-1817 Georgian era England meaning under King George III (not Regency era 1811-1820) gentlemen and gentlewomen were allowed no occupation which led to poverty, women's only acceptable honorable activity was to become married.

B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This movie surprised me. I was expecting a B class movie, but I really enjoyed it and can not wait to watch again
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Love inspector Pendergast! Live these books. Very exciting and well written. I have enjoyed all of the book sieve read so far. Hope they keep coming!
B000J4KDOA|5.0|A review from me is at this point meaningless. This novel has attained stardom. It's author is on the verge of retirement, if not already there. Most of those who want to read the novel have done so, as I am at the end of the line, or at least somewhat close. But here I am, telling you that like so many others I loved A Spy Who Came in from The Cold. Better late than never. For me, it now educates how I read any future spy novels as it sets a standard. I can reevaluate others that I have read. I don't join the chorus who think of Le Carre' as perfection, but he sure is good, and for that we can be glad. I am.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Great game! I just wish you were able to access the extra life feature and gifts your friends send, like you can when I play this on my computer, through Facebook.
B0016K40KY|5.0|They just don't make films like this anymore.  The acting, the locations, and of course the music were all superlative.  And very real --no computer-generated special effects.  Loved the camels!
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder picked up where D&D 3.5 left off, creating a solid RPG. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy role-playing games. I bought this copy for a friend. My copy is so well used that I am amazed it still holds together!<br /><br />Pathfinder can be played in your own setting, or you can use the publishers detailed world. This Core book is the doorway into a rich, well done and solid RPG. Several other products expand upon the Core Rulebook and give the game even more variety. As a Game Master I am in love with easy, common sense rules. As a player I love the classes and choices open to me.I just can't say enough about this game!
B000V6OMMU|5.0|Great for ballet music! If you like moving music, this CD is perfect for you. I am a ballet dancer, but I love music with a lot of build instead of traditional classic!

B00FHATBGW|5.0|The Keepers: Lost Progeny Collector's Ed. was an excellent game...made me feel like the McGyver of BFG Kindle Fire games.  By that I mean that you have to use your brain throughout the game.  Awesome and not boring or too easy.  Loved it!!!!!
B007QVLKI2|5.0|The only reason i didn't give it 4 stars is because the four star rating is definitive on amazon's rating system of &#34;I like It&#34;, and i didn't like it, I LOVED IT. It is one of the types of cds you can listen to over and over again. Almost all of OMAM's songs were hits. Glad i bought it.

0670024856|5.0|Alma Whittaker is a very unlikely heroine – a lumbering spinster born with a face like a bowl of porridge and a mind like a steel trap.  Her passion is – get ready! – the theory of competitive alteration of moss…or, as some might say, natural selection.  And if that makes you want to go running for the hills, there are a few surprises in store.<br /><br />For starters, the book is a fascinating look at (among other things) the uneasy alliance (or lack thereof) of the realms of science and the spiritual…the concrete and the magical.  The very title of the book is based on the work of a sixteenth-century cobbler named Jacob Boehme, who believed that “God had hidden clues for humanity’s betterment inside the design of every flower, leaf, fruit and tree on earth. All the natural world is proof our Creator’s love.”<br /><br />Or is it?  Is it the Creator’s touch or the scientist’s playground?  How much are we meant to understand?  What does one consider a “fortunate life?”  What about the anomalies of human compassion and self-sacrifice?  And is love still love if it’s too pure for this world?<br /><br />Now, take all these questions and fold them into a great adventurous yarn – the rags-to-riches story of Alma’s father…the smuggling of plant clippings to eager entrepreneurs …the challenge of being a sister to a beautiful abolitionist sister…unrequited love and the discovery of self-pleasuring…and a love affair with a man who is as committed to the mystical as she is to the concrete.<br /><br />Along the way, the reader learns about the customs and culture of Tahiti (and what a cruel Tahitian sport can teach us about the human animal), a woman’s role in the Age of Enlightenment, Darwin’s theory of the never-ending struggle for survival,  and where our journeys take us in the quest for knowledge.<br /><br />Kudos to Elizabeth Gilbert for stretching herself far beyond her best-selling memoir Eat Pray Love and searching even deeper into the questions of our time.r into the questions of our time.
B000QCQ8XA|3.0|In the past few weeks, I've read way too many stories dealing with the death of a spouse, either directly or indirectly. While not every one of those books was a downer, by the time I reached How to Talk to a Widower I felt as though I should be waving a white flag around, yelling &#34;I give up!&#34;<br /><br />Honestly, I think this was a good book. There was actually a lot that I enjoyed about it but I didn't enjoy it as much as I probably would have if I hadn't just finished off a marathon session of similar books...just a bit of readers fatigue I guess.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Valerie June has a unique, genre-defying sound that is at once earthy and other-worldly. Blues, bluegrass, R&B, and old time country find their way into the mix. Seeing her perform in person is a real treat and this album reinforces the fact that Valerie June is one-of-a-kind performer.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I have a confession to make; I am a recovering fan girl.<br /><br />For me however, my love came in the form of a band, not from a series of books. And I did not spend my days writing slash fan fiction about the band members (as least on paper) but I totally got Cath and her love for Simon Snow. And I got how her devotion to Simon Snow sometimes left her alienated.<br /><br />There are some books that I like because they are well written. Executed to perfection. Have  so many twists and turns that I never quite know which way is up. And then there are books that while they may or may not contain these elements...but I like it all the same because dammit, this is a book about myself.<br /><br />Fan Girl was one of these books. Oh sure, I thought it was a terrifically well versed book and everything about this book just worked right. But it was Cath and her undying devotion to Simon Snow that cinched this book as a winner. Our situations could have been different. I never left for college (commuted, so I missed out on dorm living), my Mom is the total opposite of Cath's and unfortunately I never had a Levi in my life at that period of my life but it didn't matter.<br /><br />I finished Fan Girl on Thursday night. Hubby and I were driving home from an American Legion meeting and I insisted that I had to stay in the car until I finished it completely. My husband made fun of me, but I did not want to stop reading even long enough to walk up the flight of stairs to our apartment. Now though I'm kind of wishing that I had stretched the book out even longer as nothing I've read this weekend has caught my attention as Fan Girl did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Don't know what makes this game so special...but I just can't stop playing!  prepare to spend all your free time swishing Dolores candies around the hoard!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm embarrassed that it took so long for me to jump onto the Gone Girl bandwagon. It's been at least a year (maybe even longer, I can't keep track of time anymore!) since I first started hearing everyone rave about how great this book was...but somehow it took until last weekend for me to finally get around to getting my hands on this novel.<br /><br />Because it took me so long to read this book I knew that there were only two ways it could go. Best case scenario...it would live up to it's hype and maybe I would discover a new author. Worst case scenario...I would not like this book and be terribly disappointed at the hype (much like the Twilight series...lol).<br /><br />Somehow though, Gone Girl did not go either way...it completely surpassed any expectations I had developed by the numerous reviews I read. It was a completely insane experience, I don't think I've ever read a book that completely shattered me at every chapter. Every single time I thought I had figured out what was happening, what was going to happen...Flynn completely switched everything around so what I thought was truth turned out to be fiction. And this happened over and over again until the very last page. Definitely NOT the kind of book I should have been reading at work as it took every ounce of my willpower not to push my work aside to keep reading.<br /><br />Supposedly, Gone Girl is going to the big screen...and honestly, I have NO idea how they are going to pull it off...I don't think it's going to translate very well.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Missing is some of the Mickey Haller charm; he's not tooling about in his Lincoln and there's only a cameo by ex number two. But we get a dose of Maggie and a lot of time with Connelly's best-known character, Harry Bosch as Haller works a case from the other side of the aisle. Haller doesn't out-think everyone this time, but we do get our most thorough look at some of Haller's inner struggles. A fun read for both Bosch and Ballet fans that mixes courtroom thriller with hard-boiled detective.
B005F9CP7M|5.0|Arrived on time and in great condition. I bought this because I liked the singer but had never heard the album and I was surprised to  instantly like a lot of the songs immediately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy to get candy crush on my kindle. Great fun and addictive!  Each level has new and fun challenges.<br /> Love playing .
B008JFUR10|5.0|This Bluray pushes you`re hd picture and surround sound to the limit.<br /><br />Excellent from start to finish!!<br />Received as promised  on,in excellent condition.<br />Highly Recommended.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A very good movie with incredible CGI, and a very good plot.  It's believable and I can see this happening in the future, perhaps as a bio-weapon. I liked the ending, because there is more to be done, and that's the basis of all science.  Experimentation, observation, and consensus.  Great movie, great acting, and enjoyable plot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was a lot of fun only wish it was longer!!<br />It wasn't too hard or too easy<br />I really enjoyed it
B00BAXFDLM|3.0|The book in its entirety is excellent.  However there are connective bits that are so dry and ponderous that it clouds the excellent plot and galactic level philosophy at the heart of the story.  I look forward to finding more from Ann Leckie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|On the way to a foster home Liesel watches her brother die. Soon after she steals her first book but not her last. Set in Munich during War War II The Book Thief follows Liesel as she becomes part of a new family and discovers a world of books. From book burning, to the Hitler youth movement, bombings and the march of Jews to Dachau The Book Thief tells this story through the eyes of young girl. While young adult books covering this subject are never exactly juvenile this book was written in a way that will appeal to a wide audience.I loved this book form the concept of the narrator to the characters and the story itself.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|not so good<br /> I waste of money and time listening it....!<br />  it may be a better job. seems to be remix with touches of disco.<br />in the 80`s I had a record whit remixes made in Berlin  (excellent)

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I, like so many others, prefer a happy ending.  This ending was rather hopeless.  I liked the going back and forth between Tris' and Four's perspectives, but, like many others, often had to look back to see who was talking.  I thought the book was good overall, but life itself is so depressing, that when I invest that much time in a book, I want to come away feeling happy and hopeful.
B000YDG5W0|3.0|The colour wasn't as dark as the picture shows and the fit was extremely large.<br />Had to return these... hoping to get them in a smaller size eventually...
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Chasing Mavericks ranks at the top of movies that happen to include surfing. I have a deep respect for those who challange to ride the waves at this spot. I've surfed Steamers Lane in my 1st contest and I didn't even go out to practice. And It is a &#34;heart in your throat&#34; episode when you surf &#34;the Lane&#34; on a Big day. The sets just about block out the horizon. This movie was  made with the best amount of professional additude that lacks in other &#34;surf movies&#34;. Bob Barbours' photo's were icing on the cake. He is a great friend and one of the best photographers out there. Bob Pearson of Pearson Arrow surfboards got great exposure and well deserved credit as one of the best rhino chasers (big wave boards) there is. We surfed in a number of contests in our younger days. Butler was great in the role as Frosty. Even if you don't surf, this movie will pull you in. Great job. And in ending, Jeff Clark was the 1st and only one to challenge Pilar Point(Mavericks) by himself for years. You all pulled it off...Mahalo, Jim Pilkenton..Clyde Beatty Surfboards..!!!
B005HEDIHG|5.0|What can I say?  This is classic Trek at it's best and any fan will be pleased with this purchase.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|5 Stars because it works as described<br />- Easy to use<br />- sturdy and durable<br />- Good instructions along with it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game !!!! Just wish you could play until you went crossed eyed instead of only 5 rounds
B002361MLA|5.0|I am deeply moved by this book! I will continue to strive for consciousness in my life everyday. I will notice my reactions and surrender them ..... I love that this book can help me escape the suffering in my life through the Spirit of God.  Thank you for raising my spiritual awareness and changing my view of happiness! =)
B00CHVJODE|5.0|GREAT ENTERTAINMENT. VERY FUNNY MOVIE.  LOVED IT. GOOD FOR KIDS AS WELL AS ADULTS. HAVE RECOMENDED TO EVERYONE I KNOW.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is amazing it is awesome and totally cool best calculator in the world. Needless to say I LOVE it. Like really love it :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I was looking for a fun game for my 3-year old that was entertaining and safe (no blood, guns, and gore). Minion Rush mostly fits the bill. There is a bit of playful violence since the goal of the game is to commit &#34;despicable&#34; acts like knocking over other minions, but nothing excessive. My only major gripe with the game is that it is a very large download and there is no warning regarding the amount of data you will use to download the entire game. That's why it gets only four stars. Otherwise, great game. Lots of fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE this book. I can't wait to know where everyone from direct 12 that lived went. The book is just amazing!!!!!!!
B00B3VB9TQ|4.0|Awesome book. It catches it attention right of the bat and doesn't slow down the rest of the time!!!!! Loved it.
B00DI75SWM|3.0|I like it but I wish I could save my creations. Over all it is ok and I would recommend it
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Great cast. Beautiful effects. Weak story. I am a huge sucker for superhero movies, but this one (despite my excitement) was utterly forgettable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game a lot of fun, I loved how it changed to the Halloween theme. I think it gets even more interesting when it gets faster
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Badly scripted, badly directed film (and I normally like Zach Snyder). Poor CG in several places, and poor action scenes. Russell Crowe does a very good job though.
0316055433|2.0|2.5 stars<br /><br />Having truly enjoyed The Secret History and The Little Friend, I was really looking forward to The Goldfinch. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />There's no denying that Tartt writes beautifully. However, there's an old saying that I think is particularly apt here: &#34;She was talking just to hear herself talk.&#34; This sums up how I felt about The Goldfinch; Tartt was talking, but there was no real substance. With the exception of the opening scene in the museum, nothing that happened to Theo drew me in, and, as the book progressed, I found myself disliking him more and more. I would have liked to see more of Pippa, but even she seemed to be just a prop on which Theo could hang his unrequited love. The painting also played very little role in the story, making it seem as though it was just scaffolding meant to hold the whole mess together. By the end, when Tartt sank into maudlin sentiment, all I could do was wish for the end to come quickly.<br /><br />I would have given The Goldfinch 2 stars for its &#34;plot&#34;; only the quality of Tartt's writing earned it the additional half-star.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Similar to the Tv show but enough different to keep me interested. I am looking forward to getting the next volume.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Stryper has done it again! They have put together a hard hitting rock extravaganza filled with powerful vocals, blazing guitars, thrashing drums, and a driving bass. They sound as good - and possibly - better than ever. Michael Sweet, Oz Fox, Robert Sweet, and Tim Gaines have all vastly grown in their individual talents and blend in perfect harmony with their instruments and voices. This disc has a great balance of ballads, and classic heavy metal. Best of all, is the no-compromise focus on Jesus as the central piece of all of their music. Stryper shows that they haven't missed a beat in 30 years and their comeback will not disappoint and is sure to garner a whole new generation of fans of the greatest Christian Heavy Metal band of all time. Stryper is primed to reach a new generation with the message that because of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus - that those who repent of their sins and put their trust in Him have \\"No More Hell to Pay.\\"
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had been searching for this series for my 8-y-o grandson, who has discovered Star Wars. This is the only place I was able to find the set, which came just as promised.  He loves it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have shelves filled with books on NDEs, OBEs, mad LBLs. And they're all wonderful in their own way. I especially recommend Moorjani's book because several aspects are unique and powerful. First, her NDE is unlike any I've read about before, in that she includes almost no physical/geographical description. It's almost all pure realization, and for that reason it feels more transferable. Second, her complete and swift healing of advanced cancer is completely documented and highly unusual. Third, the wisdom she gained during her NDE is, to me, especially simple, grounded, and, above all, useful. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in NDEs, spirituality, or the Larger Picture. I'm grateful to the author for coming back and sharing these magnificent truths with us.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has some excellent alternative magic theories and they're all great reads.<br /><br />Other good reads of his include Mistborn  and Way of Kings
B004LROUNG|2.0|Similar to an earlier book.  Toxic waste in Miss.  Just trudging along...not the best I have ever read by Grisham
B00782O7NE|5.0|The film is a feel good movie with a spectacular cast and an old fashioned theme that works movie magic on the person who is watching it.
B009HOU672|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Somewhat jazzy with great syncopation to the original themes. Listen to this a lot.
B008B68IUY|5.0|i order this as a Birthday gift for my niece....she loved it. shipping was very fast i would def. order again. i very satisfied with this purchase.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg!!! This book was hilarious and HOT!!!  I loved that it was from a guys point of view and that the guy  was an arrogant playboy who finally got his comeuppance. Don't want to give anything away, so all I can say that this was worth every penny I paid.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The series was great. This book was good until the ending...I was very disappointed with that part. Hopefully the movies do these books justice.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Starts off slow, but stick with it. This odd couple romance has great dialogue, pretty smokin' love scenes and author devotes quite a bit of time to developing the characters. This was the first book I'd tried from this author and I'm going to buy the next one. Well worth the price! I had to recharge my kindle in order to finish because i just kept reading straight through!
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|I listened to this album thoroughly before purchasing it.  I think it is one of Arctic Monkeys strongest records, and I love the thick sound it has.  But honestly, most of the songs sound the same.  I feel like this make the middle songs weaker. Almost like filler songs.  I'm glad I bought it, but not the best Arctic Monkeys album out there.
159562015X|4.0|Interesting personality inventory - am still working through all of it - it gives you your five top strengths - but reading through the other strengths is informative too - helpful for goal-setting, narrowing down college major or career options, etc.  If you buy this book used, however, you will still have to pay ten dollars to take the test on-line.  Wish I had known - I might have just purchased it new.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Charming, well written and interesting.  Malala is in INSPIRATION.  I have 3 great nieces in Pakistan who are close to her age.  I think about them in terms of Malala.  They are being educated in Islamabad.  I am SO PROUD of them, and the incident that brought Malala to prominence also makes me worry about them.  Malala is a BLESSING.  She is amazingly poised and well spoken.  I can see her continuing on a path of activism in the future.  Her story has only begun.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My 5 and 10 yr olds love this app. Plays continuously instead of timing out like some sound machines do.  Tons of sound choices that can be combined.
0316204366|5.0|This book looked so intriguing and I was fairly excited to read it. Over the chapters the author has different stories about people who have overcome the &#34;Goliath&#34; in their lives. The only is that this book is so detailed and jumps from one thing to the next before continuing on a story it made it difficult to read. I did not enjoy reading it after the first few chapters. I wish I could say I loved it but I did not. I have not read this author before so I can't say if this is like his other writing. I did enjoy the Biblical aspect that is woven throughout the entire book.<br /><br />&#34;I received this book from B and B Media Group for free in exchange for an honest review.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've had those app for.about 10 months ITS WORTH.THE.MONEY.But  I have the kindle fire hd and some.Times it will just place block every where and walk all over the place and some times it will crash ore freeze and deletes my world's it #+?$@$ me off but do buy it just try not to make a fire place some times.it will not turn out good
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some levels it doesn't explain how to get rid of the jellys but other than that it's a pretty cool game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was amazing, it may have been a little redundant, but I guarantee I will be reading book #4....Gideon and Eva make me want more!  I think that the live that they have, maybe too much &#34;unreal&#34; sex happens but something we all want to have, happens with them. We all want that insatiable love that makes you want more, day after day!
0385537131|5.0|John Grisham takes us back to racially charged Ford County, the setting for his first novel \\"A Time to Kill\\".  Jake Brigance is back and this time he's fighting to validate a will handwritten by a client whom he's never met.  The client, a wealthy white businessman, kills himself and posthumously hires Jake to protect the will against almost certain challenges.  It turns out that the deceased, in his new will, leaves nothing to his children and grandchildren.  Instead, he leaves the majority of the estate, worth millions, to his maid, a poor black woman who has worked for him for only a short period of time.<br /><br />Jake finds himself pitted against the children of the deceased and their teams of experienced, well-funded attorneys and, with his obligation to uphold the terms of the handwritten will, he finds himself on the same side as the maid even though he actually represents the estate and not her.  When the maid hires an attorney adept at both race-baiting and self-promotion, it just makes Jake's job that much harder - and the story that much more interesting.<br /><br />I haven't been pleased with many of Grisham's latest works but this time he's delivered a story more reminiscent of his early efforts.  I wasn't totally surprised at how the case unfolded or with the verdict itself but that didn't take away from the enjoyment I got from reading a well-written story.  If you are a fan of legal novels then this is definitely one Grisham book that I won't hesitate to recommend.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Cool book, well written, keeping in tension. Hard to get away from reading it.<br />I was reading it on kindle so I did not realize how big it is in hard copy version :)
B003NFM3JK|2.0|I've read the Christmas Carol many times and it is my favorite traditional Christmas movie.  For those who do not know, the story is about the redemption of a man so heartless that drastic measures have to be taken.<br /><br />However, the measures taken in this movie are too drastic.  It should have been rated PG-13.  In short, they destroyed the wonderful beginning.  The film had promise, but it didn't keep that promise.  I wish I had Red-Boxed it first.<br /><br />I give the talented voice-actors a solid 5.<br />The animation a solid 4 - because sometimes Scrooge looked wall-eyed or cross-eyed.<br />The script gets no stars and Disney a -6 for stamping their approval on a vastly inferior production.<br /><br />Below are spoilers, but a few reasons I can't give this film a better rating.<br /><br />Marley's lower jaw became unhitched during his famous rant and he had to manipulate it to speak.  Macabre and bizarre.  All previous versions of Marley had at least stirred some empathy from me, but not this one.  I liked his long chains and locked trunks better than him.<br /><br />The ghost from Christmas past was a flame-headed alien with an unpleasantly sinister voice. If you read the book, you will find the ghost looked human - most of the time, not like a wandering candle.  This was never my favorite ghost, but at least the ghost showed more human qualities in the other productions.<br /><br />The second is usually my favorite ghost.  What isn't to love?  He looks like and laughs like Father Christmas.  However, in this version, the ghost has a heart-attack, complete with gripping his chest and moaning in pain.  He turns chalk-white and dies in front of Scrooge - disintegrating into a laughing skeleton while the twins of ignorance and want become, respectively, a criminal and a screaming lunatic (literally).<br /><br />The last ghost, the one that everyone should expect to be creepy, finally fits the bill and they did a great job with him.  BUT they added a long drawn-out chase scene involving red-eyed horses that chase an ever shrinking-in-size Scrooge who then speaks like someone that's been sucking helium.  Here, the film became a confusing collage of Sleepy Hollow and Darby O' Gill meet Scrooge!<br /><br />At the end, where Scrooge is cavorting around, lightened of his decades-old burden of acknowledging the miracle he's been given, the cleaning woman freaks out and swears.  It wasn't needed and it wasn't funny.  There were no warm fuzzy feelings for me at the end.  I did not rejoice for Scrooge because it fell far short of my expectations.  I say save your money and time, don't bother with this one - watch the one with George C Scott as Scrooge.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Brings back a ton of very good and sometimes frustrating memories from my childhood all they way through to my adult years as well! The original NES Metal Gear games could be tough at times, at least when I was younger but the Metal Gear Legacy Collection is a must buy for any huge Metal Gear fan.
B004CURZFC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Did I mentioned I love this movie?  To me, it should have been movie of the year that year..but I knew it would not.  Politics you know?
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|Great headset, well worth the money!  I had a hard time getting it working with my PS4 until I found some easy to follow instructions online.  It's plenty loud enough and very good sound and chat.  Only reason it's not a 5 out of 5 is it cuts out if I'm laying on the couch playing,  needs a little more wireless reach IMO.  Also was sad it doesn't work with my PC or laptop like my PX21 did.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|3.5 stars.<br /><br />*Warning: mild spoilers*<br /><br /> Allegiant is such a difficult book to rate.  It took me a while to decide on a rating, but in the end I decided on 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  If it weren't for the ending, though, this would probably be 3 stars.<br /><br /> Okay, so what happened to the amazing writing in Divergent and Insurgent?  Those books were fast-paced, action-packed, and had strong characters.  And I felt like Allegiant was lacking slightly in all those areas.  The pacing was weird, making me occasionally bored with the plot.  There was a fair amount of action, but there was also too much useless, boring dialogue between the characters.  And what happened to the formerly kick-butt Tobias?  While I still liked Tris in Allegiant, Tobias was more wimpy than he was in the previous books.  His POV and Tris's were way too similar.<br /><br /> Still, there were definitely moments in Allegiant that I appreciated.  I love the minor characters; they each stand out in their own way.  There are a couple adorable Tris/Tobias scenes.  Mostly, though, I love how Roth writes about relationships.  I love the tension between Tris and her brother, Caleb, and how Tris has to decide the importance of family and how far she'll go to save her family and friends.  I thought their brother/sister bond was written very realistically.  There's quite a few quotes that I loved, too.  Roth writes beautifully about the meaning of bravery and sacrifice.<br /><br /> I'm still in shock over the ending.  I disliked it at first, even though it made sense and was very fitting.  But now, I have to say that, as sad as the ending is, I do like it.  I admire Roth for that ending; it took guts to write that.  It's very heartbreaking and actually moved me to tears, but I'm happy with it.  Not every dystopian has to have a happily-ever-after ending, and Roth has proved that.<br /><br /> Although Allegiant didn't hold my attention as much as the previous books, I still found itto be a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.  I can't wait to see what Veronica Roth writes next!
B001GA1RFA|2.0|It was an okay book. I finish what I start. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Overall kind of stupid.
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|The book started out a bit slow, and I moved on to another  book after reading  about 25 percent. I eventually came back to it, and I'm glad  I did.  The comparisons between the thought processes of the rich and poor were very eye-opening. I would recommend this book to anyone  ready to move to the next financial level.
B003ZSISGM|4.0|Good story, enjoyed it right to the end! I found the book much more enjoyable than the movie which leaves little to the imagination.
B00F8MIIKO|3.0|Good movie but low end quality download.  I am going to buy the blue ray.  I really loved the movie though.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this version a lot better than the original. I just wish you could &quot;EARN&quot; the crowns a little easier than what you can under either game. To have all the opportunities for using them that you offer and you can't earn them any easier than what you can takes some of the fun out of it.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Get this it is fantastic and it moves so fast, never a dull moment.  I can't wait for the next season.  Mollie Bailey
B0018CWEYY|1.0|don't waste your  time with lost.  if  you have started  watching it and you haven't finished it,  just do yourself a  favor and stop now.  don't even bother  because you will not get any questions answered and no resolution. a  complete waste of  time and money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the different levels and the fact some boards just fly by while others take much longer.  Great game! Different challenges at every board.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|I love this movie! It has a great cast, great colors, great ideas, and is overall a beautiful movie.  I'll watch this again and again for years to come.

B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|By far the worst episode of TWD. They are running out of material & this was just a filler episode. BOO!
B003O97W5K|4.0|Poltergeist is, perhaps, one of the best horror films ever made about a haunted house in California.  Now, while the movie was made in California, people better look into the real past of what made the movie come about.  If you really want to hear the true story behind the motion picture, then look to a little town called Black Hope, Texas, and there you'll find some of the ideas that movie maker Steven Spielberg used to make this wonderful horror movie.  The special effects in this movie are by far the best I've ever seen for a motion picture!  But there's one thing lacking on the extras menu: the original movie trailer from 1982.  The trailer was very well done and I've tried to find a true copy of it on YouTube, but with limited success.  All the same, this movie, along with the sequel: &#34;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&#34; are the only ones that really had any meat on the bones--the third movie was ridiculous beyond anything imaginable.  The special effects were poorly done, in my opinion, and the movies could've ended with just &#34;Poltergeist II: The Other Side&#34;.  Now some might disagree with me on that, but that's okay, because that's why we have our own opinions.  Hope this helps people out when wanting to buy Poltergeist on either DVD or Blu-Ray.
B0091THRCU|3.0|The coating along the top of the case was worn down to a white base material.  I was not impressed with the fit or the finish of the Snugg case. Other reviewers commented that the coating on the case wore off quickly.  I wasn't expecting genuine handcrafted leather.  I did expect a product that passed quality control. Buyer beware.<br /><br />Update:  The manufacture of the Snugg case sent me a replacement to test.  The fit and finish of the replacement case was great. Snugg followed up several times to ensure that I was pleased with the quality of the replacement.  I cannot comment on the long term wear issues that others reported.  I decided to spend an extra $20 and purchased a genuine leather slip case from another manufacturer before I received the replacement from Snugg. I'll report back if I return to the Snugg case. Snugg should offer a genuine leather version with the elastic pull strap and  three card holders....  I would be first in line to purchase such a model.  Snugg clearly cares about their product and their customers.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Amazing movie. all pilots should train under the influence of drugs and alcohol. naw just kidding! great movie though. Denzel never fails to put up a awesome performance!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I would have given this series a 5 , except I was a bit disappointed with the ending.  But I highly recommend!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Put you child in front of the screen and go do what ever you need to do. they will sit in front of this really cool movie front start to finish! then prepare for every thing to be Mater Mater Lightning Mc queen bla bla bla ! lol<br /><br />It's a really good movie!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is very entertaining but has some in game flaws the need repair. I cannot friend other people and the storage building takes to long to upgrade. I enjoy to sit down for a few minutes with the game. Would play over and over again. Not a game to sit down and play for days because you would run out of supplies and things to do.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Really! You have to ask? for goodness sake's this movies an Icon! staring Icons, written By an Icon! directed by and Icon!<br /><br />If Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson had a baby it would be The Shining!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy GLAD when I saw that kindle finally received the application for this game. I play whenever I have free time. It's a brain buster.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great cast great writing! the zombies are a constant menace but what keeps me coming back for more is the great &#34;very dark and gritty&#34; story line.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very good device. It works very easy with my Android phone and tablet. With Google Chrome it is possible to broadcast local videos and songs even from my Linux Kubuntu.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it and couldn't put it down. It was feel-good, yet realistic and heart-breaking at the same time.  Highly recommend!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This author gets it right,  first ninety percent of the supplements out there are a scam, I tried them all, I use to spend about two to three hundreds dollars a month on supplements. Now I just used coffee as a pre workout and protein mix with Gatorade as a post workout,  I'm saving a ton of money and still gaining weight. Second I was a walking stick figure tried every number of reps a found out that six reps is the only way to go to gain size. great book for those not in steroids.
B00G91WB3S|4.0|I am not a huge Superman fan, but it was done really well.  And told the beginning of superman, which probably helped in why I liked this movie.  Even if not a Superman fan, I would recommend this movie.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a great adaptation of an exceptional book. The acting is believable and the characters draw you right in to the story.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I am AWESTRUCK. My 25 year old son introduced me to \\"Game of Thrones\\", and I am HOOKED!!! -  Along with millions of others, evidently!!!<br /><br />This award winning TV series is absolutely superb!  I am so impressed with the excellent acting, the strong, detailed character development, the gorgeous cinematography, the stunning set designs, and the unexpected twists and turns of the passionate story line.<br /><br />This is as high quality as television gets, and HBO has spared no expense in order to deliver one of the finest series ever produced. This is simply a modern mid-evil masterpiece of a show.<br /><br />I LOVED Season One, and Season Two continues to deliver excellence and thrilling entertainment after the shocking and intense events of the first season. If you have not watched this series, you MUST START RIGHT NOW!  I cannot wait to see the next season -  waiting for my delivery of Season Three now! Yaaaay!!! A truly beautiful series to own and treasure.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book felt much like a soap opera - I became invested in what happened next, and it was hard to put down. I finished it in two sittings.<br /><br />However, I did give it 4 stars instead of 5 due in part to its predictability. It kept my interest, sure, but I had guessed what the husband's secret was very, very early in the story and knew where most of the rest of the book would go. There were a few little surprises along the way, but the secret and the ending left me feeling like I could have stopped reading only a few chapters in and wouldn't have missed much. I was expecting a bigger plot twist, or a more dramatic ending, and although each of the three character stories were interesting to follow (which is why I kept reading), the book didn't leave me feeling any particular way when I finished.<br /><br />I also must say that this author, although this is the only book I've read by her, has a habit of &#34;telling&#34; rather than &#34;showing&#34; when it came to the emotions of the characters. I am not someone who needs to be told, &#34;she said angrily&#34; over and over again. I would rather read about the way the character slammed her fist on the table, sending vibrations shivering across the oak wood table and disrupting her partner's cup of honey sweetened tea. The author did this occasionally (and in my opinion, failed in her descriptions), but I felt like I was being spoon fed feelings instead of being allowed to create and feel them myself. It was the dialog between characters that kept me turning pages, and I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs of poorly descriptive and irrelevant text to find the continuation of a dramatic conversation. I would then go back and read what I skipped over, only to find that it had actually taken away from the emotion of the dialog and would have dampened the effect had I read it all before finding the next quote.<br /><br />I connected well with Tess' story, particularly because I experience social anxiety myself. Had her story not been there I might have closed the book early on, after figuring out what the husband's secret was before ever having to actually read the letter in the book. But since I had paid for it, I decided to finish it, and I am not entirely disappointed. I did like the way three seemingly different stories came together (although it was hard to keep track of all of the characters at first), and the way Tess handled her situation. I liked that it was dramatic enough to keep me turning the pages, even if the ending wasn't quite what I had hoped for.<br /><br />Four stars might be a little generous. It would have been a good book to borrow from the library for a weekend, but not one I would pay another couple dollars to buy for a friend. It had some edge, some mystery, some surprise, but doesn't have me recommending it to anyone. It was a nice, one-time read.
B009BDVD2Q|4.0|I started reading this on my computer and was thoroughly confused. I kept asking myself, &#34;Isn't this a book on writing?&#34; I couldn't figure out why King was writing about his life instead of writing skills. I skipped ahead a few chapters and it was the same thing, but I kept reading because it was a good read. When I got to the section with writing advice, I found the same level of authenticity there as was in King's biography. I found it much easier to take his advice knowing his story.<br /><br />The first half of this book illustrates something I believe in: It is better to show someone than to tell them<br /><br />My favorite line from this book is:<br /><br />&#34;By the time I was fourteen (and shaving twice a week whether I needed to or not) the nail in my wall would no longer support the weight of the rejection slips impaled upon it. I replaced the nail with a spike and went on writing.&#34;
1781162646|4.0|I've learned to be wary of short Stephen King novels.  While he can write 5 star books at 1000+ pages a pop, some of his shorter books (Blockade Billy, The Girl who Loved Tom Gordorn, Firestarter to name a few in mho) have been mediocre at best.  When I picked this one up, I was worried this would be another one that he &#34;cranked&#34; out while waiting for that next great idea.<br /><br />Joyland was a great story.  Part murder mystery, part old fashioned campfire ghost story, all centered around a landscape that we've all been to but most of us probably never truly understood.  It was excellent!
0321811984|4.0|To cut to the chase, the book can be summed in a one sentence excerpt:<br /><br />“Information plus emotion and visualization wrapped in unforgettable anecdotes are the stuff that stories are made of.”<br /><br />Each portion of that sentence is developed in a succinct and powerful manner throughout the book.<br /><br />I liked reading Presentation Zen (PZ) simply because it lives up to its promise of being simple and informative. Maybe it’s the minimalist in me, but I love books that are to the point and useful. PZ removes the complication from effective speaking.<br /><br />I also find PZ to be realistic in its assessment of  the necessary qualities of an engaging speaker in today’s culture. For example, Reynolds posits that a conversational tone trumps a formal tone.<br /><br />I could go on about what’s in the book, but honestly in the time it takes you to read a few reviews is you could have read a chapter or two. And if you absolutely hate it (which I highly doubt) you’ll only be out an hour of your life.

0345803485|4.0|This book was a fun read. I'm glad I read it before the movie comes out, but I think the Christian Grey I created in my mind will be way more handsome than the one in the movie.
1581806574|4.0|I chose this book for myself and my artistic 6-year-old twins after comparison-shopping every dragon-drawing book on amazon, and I was not disappointed. It's well rounded and easy to use, it shows very basic techniques and explains why you're drawing things a certain way, and encourages you to be creative and put your own spin on things even in the very first steps. You can use this book to draw your easy &#34;beginner&#34; dragons, and it takes the level of detail to very advanced levels, too. I like the author's art style. The only thing that could be better is that the sections on drawing the various other fantasy creatures were a little brief, but you can't have everything. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I save that rating for absolutely stunning works.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I'm glad I took the time to read the book and much of what I saw relates to everyone in the workforce. Most importantly, I saw some new things to discuss with and work in with my daughter.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|I am a superman fan always.  I love this movie so so much.  This is a great re-make.  Great story.  Never pictured that they could make a superman movie this good.  Great cast.<br />The best superman movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive. I know people who forgo sleep to crush the candy. It's sad. They need rehab just for this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|LOVE it. Can work at any speed depending on number of pieces selected and can be easy or difficult .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I like the hallloween version more than the regular version I kinda don't want them to change it back.
B00AQO1VYY|1.0|I ordered this as a birthday present for my boyfriends father, I ordered it in August, but didn't give it to him until October. When he went to go open it on Halloween, ALL THE DISC'S WERE MISSING but it had the book. It was still in it's manufacturer's wrapping, sicker, everything. But no disc's.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|A truly remarkable book, the detailed study of one amazing woman's life. Gilbert created characters perfectly situated in time and space with such detail that I will remember them as friends for a long while. Don't pass this one up if you didn't enjoy Easy, Pray, Love. You'd be missing out on a great novel.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Absolutely , love it. Bought extras for presents. Saved us house hunting and when we went to see my sons car races.
1597801585|5.0|I adored this book.  It was clever, smartly written, with sharp characters.  No one is perfect in this story.  Everyone seems to have an angle of some sort, which I liked.  Bacigalupi doesn't talk down to his readers; at times I wasn't quite sure what was going on, but I had faith I'd figure it out as  I read on, and I did.  There is an awful lot going on too.  Subplots and twists and turns.  This is a fascinating future world.  I've read a couple of his teen lit books, and they are good, but this is great.  I can't even remember to whom I lent it now... I just want it back!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|When reading this book I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. I loved how it was written, and the fact that it was from a male point of view. I read allot of books, and get the same thing from all the books. The whiny, dramatic girl point of view. This was very refreshing!
0345803485|1.0|Why?  Badly written.  Very badly written.  It makes me, an English teacher, sad to see something this badly written.  I don't know anyone that finds it titillating, or exciting.  Maybe they're lying.  I know my fantasy does not have anything to do with being spanked, or told what I can and can't eat.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love the action in the game these type of games makes the game more interesting. I would play more games like this
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game! It gives a real life experience of owning a city! You have to manage it with great care. It is so detailed that you even have to keep the population happy. You are like a government in this game! I hope you enjoyed this review. And please get the game!

B008602KQI|3.0|I just don’t ever find myself reading these novel-based movies (before or even after they come out). I came across The Hunger Games one day while browsing through my Prime account, and well the previews looked appealing so I thought I’d give it a chance. The Greek based novel and plot of the movie seemed like excellent concepts, however, like many novel to movie stories much was lost in translation. From what I gather, if you haven’t read the book then it makes sense why the film doesn’t clearly develop Lawrence’s character and relationship to others in her district. Having said that, the movie is clear in establishing that there are 12 districts (each being known for one thing- Lawrence’s district is coal). Every year, each district sacrifices one male and female member between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight to the death until there’s only one standing. Lawrence plays a quiet and skilled bowman with a bit of a rebellious streak; the movie follows her until the very end where the writers clearly leave a cliff hanger for the next sequel.<br />Pros:<br />The fashion and make-up is eye catching and captivating<br />The challenges presented are much like survivor<br />If you like multi angle shot action movies then you will enjoy this<br />There are some creative changes throughout the movie that give little twists in the plot<br /><br />Cons:<br />The beginning does a crappy job of piecing together what’s going on<br />There’s too little information explaining Lawrence’s relationship with others in her district<br />Character development isn’t done very well (not sure if this was intentional or not)<br />As other reviewers have stated some of the characters actions just don’t make sense<br /><br />Bottom line, do not get your hopes up or have high expectations going into this movie! The acting is mediocre, the only thing that saved it for me was Lenny Kravitz and the creative direction they’ve taken with costume, make-up and d&eacute;cor. I hope the reviews from this movie heavily influenced the team on the sequel Catching Fire…Again, no high hopes here.reviews from this movie heavily influenced the team on the sequel Catching Fire…Again, no high hopes here.

B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Plot: We follow Foster as a little girl whose father pushes her intrigue and love of science, astrology and CB radios. Her father passes away shortly after her introduction in this movie, which further instills her scientific as opposed to religious view and approach to life. We then see Foster having made a career in the field of astronomy, particularly with interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. After getting private funding, Foster comes across a unique pattern of sounds that is later found to be a precise set of instructions to build a machine. With dreams of sharing contact Foster will do anything to see this through, despite all the religious and political turmoil along the way.<br />There is some excellent cinematography in the movie with some interesting special effects, but nothing that would completely ruin the film like a lot of CGI these days. The acting is good and is made to feel more natural with the use of real news clips and voice archives. The only thing that doesn’t come across as natural is the “relationship” between Foster and McCauneughey. Other than that, if you enjoy anything fantasy related, thought provoking, or perhaps a little more sciencey less fictiony then this is the movie for you!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Certainly entertaining, but not on par with King's recent or past epics.  They can't all be 5 stars.  I thought it was on the lighter side for a King novel, even skeletal compared to his usual robust character development.  It was the first book I've ever read on a Kindle or similar device.  Maybe that had something to do with this review.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|Copycat follows Weaver as a forensic psychologist who after a near fatal attack from a serial killer has almost completely withdrawn from life. Hunter plays a committed and hard-working cop who tries pulling Weaver out into the world again, at least long enough to help catch a killer who’s copying the murders of past serial killers.<br />Despite its release in ’95 Copycat is still an effective thriller with a dynamic cast of actors and a believable plot that’s easy to follow. It allows you to think and not be overwhelmed by too many details and side stories, as well as the movie sticking to a more classic horror instead of the now popular gore galore slashers. I highly recommend this film if you’re a fan of horror, suspense and psychological thrillers, this is sure not to disappoint! Plus it’s great seeing Weaver’s range of character portrayal.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Good idea.  Content is pretty good at times.  I like the user interface.  Great pictures and such.  It is up to you how good it will be.
B008JD7VZM|4.0|I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter who is a huge Minecraft fan. She had no trouble following the directions and putting the design together. She also enjoys the figures that came with the set. The only reason I did not give this product a 5 star review is because of the price and size. I feel the Legos themselves could have been a little bigger and the price for the product could have been less, maybe around $25.  I would recommend this to any child 8 years of age or older or any child who is younger but is able to follow directions or has put together Legos in the past.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is one of my favorite kindle games, but after awhile when you're basically set forever,it gets really boring and not very exciting,which is why I give it 4 stars,but awesome in any other way.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|A very traditional 10th century novel about a modern woman.  Entertaining and informative without being preachy.  Nothing NYReview would like.
B00GOQ9M4O|2.0|This was one of the worst episodes of The Walking Dead.  Devoting an entire episode to the Governor, or &#34;Brian&#34;, felt terribly long, especially when there is so much going on back at the prison.  The family he meets is run by two clueless, one dimensional women who seem hardly capable of walking, much less surviving this far into apocalypse.<br />The only interesting moments were the transition from killing a man with the oxygen tank to shoveling the ground for his burial and the two scenes with Caesar.<br />Aside from that, really, really disappointing.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|This was a really LONG book - a bargain if I count how many pages of competent writing I got for the money.  The beginning, parts of the middle, and the ending, which I suppose should be all that matters in rating a book, were awesome.  That the middle was FILLED with LONG sequences of what seemed like inconsequential doldrums didn’t hurt the story in any meaningful way.<br /><br />Sure, it irked me and made my thumb sore from flipping page after page, scanning, but not actually reading anything.  Every once in a while, I’d pause to read some text just to make sure I didn’t miss out on anything crucial to the story.  I didn’t.  Well, I assume I didn’t because there was nothing in the ending that I had trouble understanding.<br /><br />I did read enough of the trivial stuff to know that it seemed well written, even if was listless; just the sort of boring, ordinary, day-to-day stuff that I imagine literary snobs like to read.  Maybe King was trying to appease them - to be all things to all people.  Or maybe he was trying to make readers feel as if they were aging right along side George.<br /><br />Whatever his reasons, Stephen King provided a compelling time-travel story that provided some American history as a bonus.  I’m tempted to complain that there were too many parts that required me to suspend belief, but I stop to remind myself that this IS A TIME TRAVEL TALE.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift, but I had previously seen these movies and read the books.  The stories are exciting and have lots of action.  I like movies and books that are gripping!
B001XUKFAQ|5.0|So many classic comedy one-liners that are immediately recognizable. I've watched this movie quite a few times and it still makes me laugh. What a great cast. Among the best funny movies of all time and the Tom Cruise dance at the end is worth waiting for. Ridiculous and wonderful!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Not even worth watching when I got it for free on Prime. Watched fifteen minutes tops, not even. Worst Denzel movie ever.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This series defies comparison. The setting is a character in itself and each of the players are rich with underlying stories. The acting is absolutely incredible and the stories of the characters rich and deep. This was our favorite series of the season and we cannot wait for another.

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Just like the others with Kindle Fire's it crashed on me after I spent money to buy items. I love the game so I started over only to find out it will crash again. Not fun!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I usually prefer historical romances but I thought I'd give this one a chance since it was free. I'm glad I did. The story was well-written with fast pacing. The author even managed to make the concept believable though it's not common for people to marry within 24 hours of meeting. I liked both the hero and heroine very much. Their happy-ever-after was quite satisfying.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I enjoyed the story with descriptive scenes and the development of each of the characters held my attention. I especially enjoyed  the narration

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Intriguing and brilliant!  The necessary research alone is mind-boggling.  Changing the past and the impact is very scary. Stephen King is one who can pull that off effectively.  Excellent read!

B006CC0YB0|5.0|Right out of the gate, Lanegan grabs your attention and he doesn't let go. I honestly think that this is Mark's best work to date (maybe Bubblegum might be better... I keep flip-flopping). His voice is absolutely on fire (no shock there) and the music adds to the depth of the album. Highlights for me are Gravedigger's Song, Phantasmagoria Blues, Tiny Grain of Truth and especially Ode to Sad Disco which is just awesome. There are no bad songs on this album. Not one. Buy this album right away.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|interesting story, very well written... and full of passion, love, intrigue. you will not want to stop once started reading.

I can't believe that Demons wasn't the lead-off hit from this album but it will definitely draw in a whole new batch of fans. The video is makes the song  so much more intense and meaningful.

From that point forward, they are fighting for their lives against a pack of howling, angry werewolves that are trying to rips them apart for dinner - they are actually a large family of unknown werewolves. After holing up in a farm house, they struggle desperately and wait for dawn....

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you have read Grisham before, you know his stories will keep you riveted. A review cliche but true, &#34; it is so hard to put it down&#34;
0061122416|1.0|I didn't finish this book.  It comes highly recommended.  However, the writing was not holding my attention.  I felt no connection to the characters and it was slow moving.  I, too, felt that the author was spelling everything out for me over and over.  Every author has a message for the reader, but his was not being delivered in a captivating manner.  So sad.

B008JFUQZ2|4.0|My husband purchased this movie, and he is satisfied with his purchase. That is what really matters, right?  It is probably worth it.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Why I like it: The stories are interesting and varied, the writing style is very enjoyable, I can read one short story and close the book without losing any sleep .<br />Why I couldn't give it more stars: I don't find many of the stories satisfying in any way, too many of the stories are just melancholy, I didn't find any characters endearing and none of the stories are very memorable.<br />Sorry Alice, this was my first book of yours so maybe if I tried one of your earlier works I might enjoy it more than this one, and hey you won a Nobel prize so I might just take a chance on one more!
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This was a gift, and the receiver loves the movie, so it was the perfect gift for him. Good choice for the man in your life.

B00B1LN8WY|4.0|The reviews high in the 'most helpful' queue emphasized problems with the package design and production quality, so I checked these right away, and see nothing to complain about.  This release has none of the exotic design features that people complained about in those reviews.  It looks just like the complete-series sets I purchased recently from Amazon for '24' and 'Buffy': each season in a separate standard four-disc plastic box, with a printed insert summarizing the episodes and the various special features for that season (commentary for selected episodes, blooper reel, etc.), all ten seasons in a uniform format with a fitted slipcase for the whole set.  No extras like a booklet or audio cd's.<br /><br />Because of the many complaints about defective discs in those older reviews, I tested all 40 discs right away and they all looked clean and loaded normally.  For this test I used an older Magnavox VCR/DVD combo player with 480i resolution playing through a CRT tv, and they all played fine and looked normal for that display.<br /><br />But then I saw that someone had complained just a couple of days ago about the quality of the resolution in this new release, so I tried a couple of these discs using a new RCA 32-inch 1080p flatscreen with built-in DVD player including 1080 upconversion, and then I could see what they are talking about.  Even on this HD tv with an upconverting DVD player, these discs seem to play at only 480i resolution.  I got the same result with an external upconverting Magnavox DVD player playing through this HD tv. This is in striking contrast with five other complete-series sets I recently purchased from Amazon, for ER, West Wing, Buffy, 24 and Northern Exposure.  All five of those show very striking improvements in resolution over the older 480i system when played on this HD tv through either of these upconverting DVD players, but these Friends DVD's do not.  For that reason I give this set 4 stars not 5, just as the preceding reviewer did.<br /><br />So if you have an HD tv and care about resolution, you may want to spend the extra money to get this set in Blu-ray, which Amazon also offers.  In contrast, the other five sets I mentioned above are not currently offered by Amazon in Blu-ray.  A cynic might wonder whether this set was perhaps deliberately produced using some \\"480i-only\\" disc format which does not allow 1080i-upconversion, so as to generate additional demand for the more expensive Blu-ray release of the same series package.  Or, less cynically, maybe they assumed that anyone with an HD tv would also have a Blu-ray player and would always be buying the Blu-ray version of anything that was offered in both DVD and Blu-ray formats, so that the DVD version did not need to have whatever it is that allows this upconversion for these other five series sets which are offered only in a DVD format.<br /><br />But that leaves no room for people like me, who have an HD tv but no Blu-ray player yet, and who value the 1080-upconversion as I found it on these other five sets.  If some DVD formats allow this upconversion and others do not, it would be nice for this to be somehow labeled in advance.  Right now, based on these six examples, all we have is this pattern that for five cases where there was no competing Blu-ray version the DVD's allowed HD-upconversion, while for this one case where there is also a competing Blu-ray release, the DVD's appear not to allow HD-upconversion..<br /><br />So if you have an HD tv and care about resolution, you may want to spend the extra money to get this set in Blu-ray, which Amazon also offers.

B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Heroes have more depth than what is depicted in popular culture. They don't run around in capes and masks saving the world. They are real men and women who face their flaws and the obstacles that life throws at them, no matter how painful, truthfully and honestly. Denzel is a deeply flawed pilot in this movie, who manages to save hundred of lives, but struggles with addiction and does everything he can to avoid admitting this. It isn't until he faces up to this and takes personal responsibility for his flaws that we see the real hero in him emerge. A very powerful drama.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|From everything I've read and heard, prison life is much more difficult than she describes.  She spends much of the book discussing the wonderfully warm and supportive relationships she developed while at Danbury.  Really?  I have a hard time believing that it was as positive an experience as she describes.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|Impressive. Action, grit and intelligence come together in this show to make it a real viewing treat. I wasn't sure what to expect, so I'm happy to report that this show had me hooked from the get go and I burned threw the first season in about a week. I love it when that happens. Looking forward to more.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|this game is hard for me and I think there should be an  easier level so people like me can actually win a game. other then that this game is great. I recomend this game to those who like a challenge and a fun game.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Not too bad, but if you have the chance, just watch the movie and save yourself 10 hours. On the other hand, nah, just rent the movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Its suspenseful and the characters are engaging.  It has just the right amount of mystery and &#34;scary movie&#34; feel.  It is strictly for adults, as there is quite a bit of sex, bad language, alcohol/drug use, gore, etc...
B008XBCJ34|4.0|We have been watching this movie a couple of times. 3D version was fantastic, however it made my eyes tired after 2 hours of watching. We enjoy it. Great movie.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|As hilarious as the first two.  My husband and I laughed out loud over and over again.  We want more!
B00FWB6ZBA|5.0|I have been a fan of this era of Genesis for years and was thrilled when Hackett released the Revisted II album last year. And even more thrilled when I got to see the tour in Connecticut in September. This DVD is outstanding for all the reasons others have mentioned and I feel lucky I am getting to relive this music these many years later. I have my tickets to the Clearwater and Orlando shows next year and this DVD is just what is needed to bridge the gap.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the guests that appeared at this show, especially Amanda. What a beautiful voice. And Supper's Ready….what can I say……..one of my all time favorite songs and it still makes me tear up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  Fun to play and keep your mind thinking. Somewhat easy. Hope there are more complex ones to come.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Super great show.  It keeps you interested in the plot and the very likable characters (the good guys).  If you're like myself, I hate commercials.  Get the series.
B000P0J024|5.0|Great CD! This is a great bunch of artists that have laid out a great soundtrack. Love all the songs.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love that this app is now available for my kindle fire hd! It needs to come with a warning &quot; addictive&quot;.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive and always leaves you wanting to go and play for extensive periods at a time. When I put the game down I instantly want to pick it back up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thought I'd finally check it out to see what all the hype was about... Well, now I know! Love it!
B00C2IPB66|5.0|I love this movie,I enjoyed watching it and i have watched it many times since I received it from amazon
B002ZG997C|5.0|I love this movie. The cinematography, acting, and story is fantastic. Denzel Washington's portrayal of Eli is excellent. The supporting cast is great as well.<br /><br />If you like post-apocalyptic stories and settings, I'd highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />*It also has a great message about the significance of the Word of God. Simply amazing.
0824835921|5.0|great delivery speed, product was in excellent condition. the book is just as helpful as the reviews suggested. i couldnt have been happier with the purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very challenging game and it is great fun but it can be a money trap also. They only start you with 5 turns and then you have a choice to either wait 24 hours for 5 more turns or you can buy 5 more for 99 cents. If you are not carefully it can add up quick! It says free but there is a catch!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It took me a little bit of time to catch onto the storyline but once I got it I found it very difficult to put down. I have not read any sci-fi novels in awhile. This was a very intriguing reintroduction to the genre. You don't need to be a sci-fi geek to enjoy this novel. It is simply a very good story. Take it for a spin, you will enjoy it,Im sure.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very good read. I felt it rather dragged in the middle but the ending was excellent . I would recommend this book to Grisham fans.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game used to be better, now it's frustrating. The game is about collecting items from bingo and slot rooms. This game used to be great, collecting item wins, trading with fb friends, but now, it's impossible to close rooms, no shadow cards on.  So i now opt for free since no one gets the hard to get items, to close a room.disappointed...
B002RSU9PY|5.0|This is a well done movie with again two of my most favorite actors Grace Kellly's outfits for this movie were amazing, the accessories fabulous.  I love the classics as it brings me back to when dressing up was top notch!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Meh.  Beautiful first 5 minutes, but obviously catering to men. Denzel is a great actor but aside from the initial 20 minutes, this show is quite predictable and somewhat slow.  Good ending too, so all said not bad.
B00340LM8C|5.0|A great classic I love these two actors and really enjoyed watching them on screen together good memories! I would recommend this movie to all those who love classics!
B002WY65VU|4.0|Fun movie. Great for hang-over mornings. Requires little effort to follow. DVD's were made well and played with no problems
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the story of Ender, a brilliant child who may hold the fate of mankind in his hands against an alien invasion. But even as Ender controls the fate of many, his own life is out of his control completely as he is forced to undergo tests of mental strength that may break him. It's a story of sacrifice, the individual for the greater good, and the price of winning as well as the cost of losing.<br /><br />A great book all around, easy quick read, but sophisticated to keep your attention. At times it may suffer from pacing issues, but the characters are so interesting and well written that it's not a distraction. There are a few unexpected twists at the end, and enough parallels to the real world to provide as a cautionary tale of the negative aspects of the military mind. The most astonishing aspect of the book is the starting parallels to modern technology and the pitfalls that we already experience almost 30 years after its publication. A good cross over book for those who like drama and fantasy, if traditional dry and technical sci go doesn't interest you. Ultimately, it's a story about humanity, as all great stories are. Highly recommended for teenagers and adults alike.
B00005LK94|5.0|I cannot get enough of this movie. The story and presentation was simply fantastic.
B00GOQ9M4O|4.0|This episode was a complete departure from other Walking Dead episodes as it focused entirely on the Governor. How does a madman attempt to redeem himself after slaughtering most of the denizens of his makeshift town? He stars in this episode!<br /><br />Given the pacing of this episode I'm pretty sure a lot of viewers will think it's a boring episode and I can't blame them, but I still enjoyed the attempt at a Governor introspective. I liked the new characters for the most part, though, one has to worry for their safety in the future as it's just a matter of time before the Governor flips the Jekyll & Hyde switch again and makes them regret ever crossing paths with him.
0838577016|5.0|Well detailed book. An encyclopedia like book that covers the basics of neural science. For everybody with an interest in neural science.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is sooo frustrating, but i can't stop playing! I wish it would have a player board, which keeps track of lives given, permission to enter new levels, and requests for lives.  If it had moore information for and between players it would be truely unbeatable!
0824835921|4.0|I thought some of the ways to memorize the kanji more complicated then actually memorizing it stroke by stroke. The hints to memorize the kanji are all ways the author used to memorize kanji, doesn't mean it will help you specifically.  I ended up having my own way to memorize most of them that made more sense to me. Other then that it is a really good product and I would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever read it was a mix of action adventure and romance<br />I picked this rating because I couldn't put it down it was so good. I liked how katniss was so smart and aware you never knew what she was gonna do next.<br />I would recommend this book because its a good length and very climatic
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My 3 and 5 year old love all of the Dr. Panda apps I've downloaded and I really didn't expect them to choose this one over the others.  But you just never know with kids. They really like it.  I haven't seen Dr. Panda's Veggie Garden since I downloaded this.  Anything that makes them happy makes me happy.  I would tell anyone looking for a good kid app to choose Dr. Panda apps.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because the title sounded weird. But then my mom and tutor told me to read it so i gave it a try and it turned out to be really good!
B009FXIICK|2.0|I was over this game about 15 minutes after playing it and I have no desire to go back. It's very one note and considering the market is saturated with these match games, you could do SO much better.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I cant, in good conscience,  give this a good review because it KEEPS FREEZING! Too bad, it's a pretty cool game otherwise.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Very cute graphics and sounds and easy enough to play.  However, it's challenging to get past a certain number of levels.  I find myself coming back to this app multiple times.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I must admit that while I love Applause I wasn't sure what to expect from this highly anticipated album. But once I was able to stream it I fell in love with a few song to start but the more I spun it the more I liked the songs. Like some of the reviewers have stated there are songs that are earworms and you fins yourself singuing the songs in your heard over and over. Make no mistake I love Gaga but without fanatism. I just find it odd how many people are trashing ther album based on it not being similar to her previous records. Personally I want the artist as well as the  music to E V O L V E. I would have hated a Fame Monster or Born This Way 2. I love both records but I'm the type that yearns and craves new music and sounds. The only sonce I would have not included in this body of work would be Jewels N' Drugs. Is just not good. From the lyrics to the sound is out of place and Gaga come across (Like Mariah Carey lately) as a guest artist rather than THE artist on the song. She barely sings on it!<br /><br />In the end is a personal choice. Depends what type of consumer you are.Do not over analize and just press play and see where the journey takes you. IF this isn't your cup of Tea then now you know for next time.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Its the first Frederick Forsyth novel I have read and a real page turner . . . indeed possibly one of the best books i have ever read.<br />The amount of work he must have done in researching this book is mind boggling and it all echoes true as I have read quite a number of books dealing with the various international agencies involved in covert activities. I am now reading The Day Of The Jackal, enjoying it enormously and looking forward to reading all of his novels in time.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|This is such a fun read, and the characters are very well written! You will want to read all the books in the series after you finish this first one.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It is a great book... I couldn't stop reading this! It is definitely worth buying. Kiera Cass is a great author.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was anxious to read this book, seeing it on the bestseller list for many months. I found the premise interesting and also enjoyed how  each chapter was written in the first person of the husband and wife { Nick and Amy}.  However, I soon realized that I didn't particularly like either of the characters.  The middle third of the book was slow, showing more character flaws with very little activity occurring. Towards the end of the book the mystery was beginning to be resolved, but by that time I no longer cared about what happens to Nick or Amy.  Apparently they didn't either.  I think I would like to try another book by this author since so many people give her great reviews, although the price would have to be right.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The app occasionally freezes. It's hard to get crowns. The graphics are really nice though. Just wish it was a little more user friendly.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy this game with its strategic city planning. As your city grows it can get a little crazy to try to keep track of supplies and deliveries. Overall I highly recommend it.
031623480X|5.0|This book should be read by anyone who thinks wheat is healthy!  It is a game changer and is backed my a neurosurgeons research.
B003E6LC6I|3.0|I could figure out what was going on right from the start so for me I watched as much as I could, it is a good show but not for me.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|book was all over the place and the story was completely implausible....horrible, horrible, horrible.  I cannot believe it was on the best seller list
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product!! really convenient. You can cast your whole laptop screen via chrome. It is not just limited to YouTube and Netflix.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We picked this up to stream some TV series and movies from our ipad to the TV and it has worked out great!
B00DW1WR14|3.0|Pearl Jam is my favorite active band, but they go through periods of being lost. (See: Vitalogy, No Code) The album before this one was subpar, as is this one. Any good songs? Of course. But the album as a whole seems like stuff that was thrown against the wall, and what stuck got included. I expect that they'll bounce back eventually. But this album is not it.
B006WZLCZ4|4.0|We bought this set to go with our Hape Kitchen and though our son loves it, I had to put away some of the utensils because he had a habit of running around with them in his mouth.  I was worried, so I put them away for a few years.  Otherwise, a great set, but probably not age appropriate for our toddler.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|From all the beautiful symbolism Greene so eloquently put in his writing, to the thought provoking topics he geniusly wrote, this book appeals to people of all ages and backgrounds.
0802473156|5.0|Great book.  Very helpful in understanding people and what they need.  Definitely worth the perusal and the consideration when interacting with loved ones.
B0001I562I|5.0|Fun movie for Kids of All ages-- grandparents too! Loved watching this with my grandson, and found it even better this time than when it came out at the theater.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Fun movie with good acting.  I do love Julia Roberts and will watch most anything she's in. I also love these kind of movies.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great practical book. Easy to read and understand. Not meant for the unwilling or stubborn. This book is only for people serious about changing their reality.
B0088TG252|4.0|Didn't love the movie itself but do love Denzel Washington and so will watch pretty much anything he's in.  Lots of action with no surprise ending.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I've been trying to find a simple way to get my phone's audio to play through the speakers in my car, and the best solution I'd come up with so far was an audio cable between the headphone jack and the aux jack on my car, and a second cable coming off my phone to charge it. Not ideal, but it got the job done.<br /><br />I found a first generation iPhone dock that a friend had given me, and I saw deal on living social for a wireless bluetooth receiver for the car, and that brought me here looking for something similar.<br /><br />I read reviews for similar products, but went with CableJive because I know the brand and I've had good experiences with their products in the past.<br /><br />I have not been let down this time. I was able to get the receiver set up within a minute of connecting it in my car. Sound quality is at least as good as with my old setup, if not better. There is no tinniness or loss of bass and my phone instantly reconnects once I'm in the car.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item if you're looking for a way to revive any sound accessory with a 30-pin dock connector.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Very predictable plot and the acting was not very impressive.  Lots of action though.  I turned it off early and I trust the good guys won in the end.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|For being Blu-Ray, the film is very grainy. In some scenes, it's annoyingly poor... Some say it was the directors intention.
1451695195|5.0|I loved it enough to order more copies for friends.  I know that there is some controversy about the author but I still think it's a great read and would highly recommend it.
B000WDSZ8E|5.0|I like to laugh and have no commercials, it is a great story line.  It is still a mystery to me who marries first.  I bet there is a surprise there.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|Great movie with an interesting story line.  The acting was great and it was easy to stay engaged throughout the film
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book I love it but kind of boring in the middle and beginning but really why kill prim really
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|A wonderful fast paced original movie.  Great action. Great acting and I can't wait for the next movie in the series.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Perfect toy for anyone who loves Minecraft.  3-D puzzle will have everyone in the family wanting a turn at playing with it.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Great mic! Sounds great and is very easy to use. My only &#34;con&#34; is that the battery is extremely annoying to replace and there is no battery indicator so if the battery dies mid-record you will have no real way of knowing unless you are staring at your -db levels the whole time. Better keep a spare battery on you at all times!
0525478817|5.0|I found this book after looking for new books for my teenage daughters to read.  It came highly recommended by other readers and so I purchased this for my girls.  They have all read it now and have loaned it to their friends.  Each one has given it high reviews.  Even thought the subject matter is emotional, the writing style and story line is appealing and enjoyable.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|This may be the last Arcade Fire album that I spend money on. Granted, I haven't spent that much time listening to this one, but I really don't see myself falling in love with it. Funeral and Neon Bible were both so awesome that I go back and forth on which one I prefer. The Suburbs was tolerable with a few solid tracks. Reflektor has been pretty disappoint so far. All the songs kinda run together into one long track of something that has the essence of Arcard Fire but none of the frenetic energy that is present in their other albums. I'm hoping I'll like it better once I spend some more time with it.
B007V693YK|1.0|This app for android is awesome. Kindle version is crap.  Shoulda bought an ipad. Can't use Google play at all on this thing
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I live on an extremely busy street and really need a plug in white noise maker but this serves fine in a pitch. You actually have lots of background noise options (rain, ocean, music, etc) and a mix-and-match/overlay option as well. It won't replace the fan I had (that died) but it's great all-around.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is really fun! The graphics are great and I didn't run into any technical problems while playing the game. 5 stars!
1480507024|4.0|why are we all so surprised ! just look at the daily lives of human beings world wide ! a microcosmos of the internatioanal scene ! internatinally there are more resources to do more damage!<br />let s just face it !! that s who we are !<br />the line between truth and lie is based upon your belief system !<br />personally i shall die with a smile on my face !
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I play on my kindle and it needs to update and it won't let me now I'm stuck with I game I love but can't play help how can I update on my kindle please want to play game
B004IF8TLU|5.0|Such a good old fashioned movie!  Hubby, children and grandchildren enjoyed this so very much.  Except for one &#34;scene with had one foul word&#34; it truly is a family movie.  Cute and filled wtih fun.
006202406X|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I need some memory serum to erase what I know about the last 45 pages of this book. It was pretty much great until the MAIN CHARACTER DIES
B003G4W49C|5.0|Epic, fantasizes an beautiful Story that will last a couple of generations, this soon to be classical book will be loved throught the world
B0041KKYDI|4.0|This is a powerful film and as close to documentary as it gets on many levels.  What a challenging subject - it takes guts to make a movie like that as well.  This is one of James Franco's best roles - paired with highly creative direction - we come to respect Aron Ralston's life, dilemma and struggle.  What could have been mundane ends up as being highly creative.  Brilliant cinematography - try making a show about a man stuck in a rock visually interesting.  This is a textbook exercise in how to work at it.  I thought briefly of Ryan Reynold's BURIED film but not the same film except that they're both stuck in a bad place.  Kudos to Aron Ralston for surviving and having his story told to the world.  This is a paean to life.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I just finished reading this book and found it to be slow and boring.  First time I've bought a book from reading reviews and it will be the last book I buy from reading reviews.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|Why I love it?  It's Seether....enough said!  They are an incredible band with amazing songs.  I've seen them live and they are amazing!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's a classic tale however you read it - hardcover, softcover, audio or electronic.  After always liking the written page to hold in my hands, I now have an electronic reader with lots of books on it.  I am currently reading Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and you know, it's pretty interesting reading an early 19th century novel and comparing it to today's works.<br /><br />Same story with Les Miserables.  I've read it before, and seen several versions of movie and theatre production.  They are all wonderful.  And, then when you go back and read it again, it's different and you pick up things you seemed to have forgotten along the way.<br /><br />It's still a great read.  Goes much faster, too, on an e-reader.  Buy it - worth the price - and read a great author again.
B00CA4S3LW|5.0|When you combine DEEP PURPLE guitarist and a young voice like Ms Night, you get the best of both worlds. Great CD.<br />Highly recommended. She has such a beautifull voice and carissma.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's a fun hunting game but it's way to easy. All the animals are right in front of you to shoot. Here are a few tips...<br /><br />Make us track and search for the animals.<br />More powerful rifles should be able to shoot through the animals hitting the one behind it.<br />And of coarse animal calls.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|When will Hollywood recognize the fact that not every single person in America can afford to live at Best Buy or wherever you buy your electronics?<br />The movie is in Blue Ray, Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet means crap to me. Who the hell cares? IF you desire to open an account and upload your Ultraviolet movies codes into it, you are now &#34;allowed&#34; to watch your version of the DVD's on any of your electronic devices. Laptops, Notebooks, phones, etc. But don't be fooled folks, UV is nothing more than a digital right authentication platform.<br />Unless you have a HD television with a Blue Ray player, you are NOT going to be able to watch these discs.<br />There is a DVD version that allows you to watch the extended version, however, if, like me, you live for the extras, 9 hours of special features and featurettes will not be available to you. That is for the Hoi Oligoi, not us Helots.<br />I have TV, it works. I do not have cable for the TV, only for the internet. We do not watch what passes for &#34;entertainment&#34; on American Television. We read, watch DVD's of movies with interest or documentaries.<br />I loved the LOTR series of movies as I had all of the books from JRR Tolkein. I do not think that the Oxford Don would approve of this singling out of people just so WB can get a little more money.<br />I was prepared to buy 4 copies of The Hobbit extended version with the 9 hours of extras. But I stopped when I saw they were not for regular TV.<br />Those who were going to get these DVD's as gifts all have TV's such as mine.<br />I do not feel that I should have to buy not only a new tv but a new player as well just to watch extras. Sooner or later, they all will be on You-Tube, the same as ST: Into Darkness has been and I can watch them there.<br />My final word is this: The screen version of the movie was AWESOME and I am sure the additional footage will make it even more so. However, studios think that the hoi polloi all have state of the art electronicsand those of us who do not aren't worthy of their bother. It is a real shame.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Brilliant premise but mediocre delivery. I stuck with it to the end but honestly, it was a struggle. It's about 100-120 pages too long. Where it misses the mark is primarily in character development. The heroes and villains are flat, stock characters. Even the Three Wisemen aren't that original, especially in the description that one (or a few??) wear a hoodie. The transitions from Book 1 to Book 2 to especially Book 3 are not smooth. There's a lot of repetition with the same actions and locations used over and over again, which is why I think this book could have benefited from a strong editor to help streamline the plot and eliminate the redundancies.  On the plus side, there's some brilliant phrase turns and you can tell the writer has done his homework with regard to the state of social media and digital technology.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I thought it was quite good until the end which seemed too contrived!  All in all a typical Grisham read!!
1442361557|5.0|A fascinating tale woven through marvelous English history. It made a very long trip much more enjoyable. Great price on Amazon, too.
B00F88H5K2|2.0|Very disturbing to watch....the acting was excellent but the story left me feeling depressed..........I regret purchasing this and not renting it.......
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Having gone through several phones since purchasing this app, I can testify the replay value is, to me, very high.
1402720602|5.0|Great book, very detailed and full of pictures.  The author demonstrates a clear passion for his work, and it shows through in the writing style.  Very happy that I purchased this book, as I enjoy adding to my collection of guitar making books when possible.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It was informative and enjoyable to read. All college students should read it and we need to continue to have conversations about real equality in the workplace and at home
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The author ended the series well. I was hoping a different ending, but this one is touching and about life going on.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a book should be loved and cherished. I laughed, I cried and felt it all.  Markus Zusak<br /> is a brilliant writer. This should be read by school children when studying history.  So vivid and real. Liesel and all of the main characters are so easy to visualize.<br /><br />LOVED THIS!#
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Love this movie.  It was very Quintin - If you liked Kill Bill you'll like this one.  Very entertaining but not family viewing.  It has it's violence but of course that is tongue in cheek violence -- but violence none-the-less.  Great adult viewing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Once I finally figured the basics, I loved it!! My six year old even tries his hand at it. Keep up the great work. Loving game.  Keep the great games coming.
1623360277|5.0|I read this book on my mini IPad and decided I wanted a hard copy so I can make notes and refer to it often. I've read many of his books and have known about him for over 20 years and knew that it would be an excellent book. His books and information gets better and is very helpful for nutrition and health. Tried and succeeded.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Nothing like the book so if you have read the book and expect it to be anything like it. save yourself some money. The movie is OK as far as zombie movies from Hollywood but it was a big disappointment to me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addicting game I have ever played. Challenging, yet fun. Great stress reliever! I definitely would recommend this game.
B002OR0RP0|3.0|My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves the original but refused to finish this movie because it was to scary.  The movie itself is good but my not be appropriate for all kids.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Really good book. I cant wait for the next book to come out. I need seven more words so ha.
B007Q476KU|3.0|Great idea for a film!! It's just kind of boring. I don't know why. THe music is outstanding, and the performance were great, too. I think there needed to be more of a plot insofar the horse is concerned. He was just floating through the war, and I didn't know what I was rooting for rather than survival of the horse. I needed more of a reason to care that he return to the boy. Maybe if the boy was blind? Something.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|spent this much to get so little. the Lego set itself is pretty cool but for spending 30 dollars and the box to be so tiny is very disappointing
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen as far as the plot goes. I prefer my super heroes to be virtuous and good. I respect Wolverine and Iron Man-flawed as they are-but I will take the ideal over the real any day of the week. I live in reality-I know we are flawed. I don't want to watch a movie about it. I loved the Christian allegory in this movie. It TOTALLY works in this version. The backstory was so philosophical, and was a constant theme throughout. I love that the filmmakers showed his youth through meaningful flashbacks rather than making it part of the plot. And, last but not least, I have never really enjoyed the Lois Lane character...always in trouble, oblivious or rude to Clark...I love this Lois. Confident, sassy, but still a WOMAN who loves and cares.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved the movie. A lot of action and good storyline. Would recommend for any science fiction fan.Hope they make more.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Wonderful family film! The family is filled with virtue and fun. Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston do a great job, and the kids are good without being too sarcastic and sassy.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This was an exceptionally well written, gripping tale by Donna Tartt.  I don't think that there has been a piece of fiction that captured my attention so totally in years.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|The Best 3 D of the year !!! A Must have for a 3D collector  !! Killer sound and video
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Short, sweet, fun read. The world is very interesting, and the characters are entertaining. A little predictable in the plot, but overall, not a bad little story.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As always, Grisham delivers a great lawyer story! Ready to start back at page 1 and read it again. !!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Ends too soon - I need more! I am very irritated with Patrick Rothfuss that he hasn't published Day Three yet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It wasn't like the first two, but it was just as good. I wouldn't change anything but that there be another book, and I would recommend for older teens and up.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If you like command and conquer, you will enjoy this game. Gold stars are a pain to get, but it's worth it nonetheless.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|GOOD POINT<br /><br />Unreal headphones, havent heard a quality of headphone that compares for under £150.<br /><br />BAD POINT<br /><br />They break. Ive had 3 pairs in the last 3 years. They have all broken in the exact same place (the mic). The wire at this specific point must wear easily, therefore disrupting the sound making them unusable. I keep buying them because I enjoy the headphone in every other aspect but it really upsets me that I have to pay £100 to replace them every year.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|One of the great classics - worth seeing over.  Do you know anyone who is THE Dude.  John Goodman is fantastic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. So intense every chapter made my teeth clench against each other. This story has rated off the charts
B00009W0WM|5.0|The greatest movie of all time.  I never tire of watching this. This one has some interesting extras as well.  I also have most if not all of the books on this film.  Who says I'm a fanatic fan?
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|I have been a fan of this TV series for over 2 years now. I was so eager to buy this season when it was made available. The storyline is gripping and the maturity of the actors kept me glued to the show. This season was worth buying as it concludes this version of the Arthurian legend.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Fiske's best film ever. At first I could not figure out what was going on, no VO no captions, then it came - this is a brilliant commentary on our society in all its forms and levels.  See also the extras how sucha tiny crew did all that with so much equipment to lug over such terrain, it is a marvel.  What a genius.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|One of the most clever and funny action films ever.  And you simply have not lived until you've seen Helen Mirren doing a simultaneous double-armed...sorry, cannot spoil the surprise.  I initially rented for the joy of seeing Brian Cox who, even when slathered in pimp-purple, is magically delicious.  Anthony Hopkins has never been more delightful as the mad scientist.  John Malkovich is a treat as the neurotic-genius sidekick.<br /><br />Red 2 forever redefines the term \\"caramelizing his onions\\" and is such great fun, I hope the original Red is available for rent as well.
006202406X|1.0|I get a lot of vindication sharing with people how awful the book was. There was a serious lack of character development, plot development and a lackluster character voice throughout the whole process. I was so phenomenally upset that yet another author has just given up at the end of their trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I loved playing this game on the net, very happy when I found it for my Kindle Fire HD!  Great game!
1582701709|4.0|Explains a concept known as &#34;the law of attraction&#34; and demonstrates how to apply it in your own life in order to better your life. Kind of a new-age concept, in that you can use the &#34;law&#34; to manifest your greatest desires. I don't swear by this book like some do, but I do believe that if you incorporate its teachings into your life you will see some positive change.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I great glimpse of the &#34;salad&#34; years of Jethro Tull. Their musicianship is on full display as one of the great progressive rock bands of all time plays from their entire catalog.
B000683VI4|5.0|One of the greatest love stories I've ever seen. It has a heartwarming ending, and this story demonstrates the kind of love that all of us hope is actually out there. I find something to cry about every time I see this movie, and I've seen it many times.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series of books and very entertaining to read.  I started the books after having seen the first movie and the books definitely provide a lot more detail than the movie.  Both were entertaining but I recommend trying to read the books before seeing the movies.
031606792X|5.0|I got sucked into the Twilight Saga by accident, but once I did there was no turning back. As soon as I'd finish one book, I'd HAVE to get the next, and then watch the movies. I'll say that the movies are really, really good, but the books are even better if that is even possible. Stephenie Meyer has a way of writing that will make you feel as though you actually know these characters and are living through the chaos, love, and adventure with them. The storyline in this saga is not gory or cheesy, and the whole vampire theme is woven into it all in a strangely believable way.This was the final book in the series and it tied everything together very nicely. Get into this saga and you'll be glad you did.
B003G4W49C|4.0|An entertaining read and interesting take on war games.  I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie as the movie leaves out A LOT of background and material.
B001JRB16U|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies, and this package delivers. The film was apparently digitally remastered for crystal clarity in sight and sound. There are 2 DVDs in here-- one was of the movie, and one was of extra features. You will enjoy all of this if you were ever a Mary Poppins fan.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|It was too predictable. It just didn't hold my interest, in fact I fell asleep several time while reading and that usually just doesn't happen.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What a great show!  If I hadn't heard about it on &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; I would never had looked it up.<br />Nathan Fillion is great in this and in &#34;Castle&#34;
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|It would be nice if I would this movie--I have waited a long time----when am I going to get my ,( already Paid for) Movie---PLease send it to me .. Thanks Ronald D, Brown ( shorty51947us@yahoo.com)
B000000OQF|5.0|You are never too old to remember the classics.  Slash is badass.  Need I say more?  Those were the days.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was fantastic and i truly felt as though i was inside of Hannah's head, from her scariest fears to her happiest thoughts. Very well written and you never know what surprises will come next.
B009CPE424|3.0|It's okay for a sequel. Not as funny and well made as the first film. But not many sequels are as good as the original movies. If you have a soft spot for dogs like I do, you should watch it.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever. We have watched it with our grandson, more times than I can count, and it never get's boring. This is a must have for your DVD collection.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|A Great Film. I have watched it many times. Anyone that loves gangster movie will enjoy this very well made film.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|In September, the Anoka-Hennepin school district, in Minnesota, banned author Rainbow Rowell from coming to speak about her book Eleanor & Park, during Banned Books Week.  The controversy caused a wave of opinions and the outrage of book lovers everywhere.  It also put Eleanor & Park on the radar of many readers, including me, as I went out and bought the audio book immediately.  Don't they know that if you ban a book, people everywhere want to read it?  I guess not.<br /><br />Eleanor: New girl in town.  Insecure, a bit overweight, and has a horrible home life.  The first day, she climbs onto the bus and no one will let her sit down.<br /><br />Park:  Reluctantly moves over on the bus.  Hopes no one notices.  Listens to his headphones and reads comic books.<br /><br />Eleanor:  I wonder if he's Asian.  He is always reading these comic books, and he doesn't notice that I am reading them too. There are no books in my house.  I have lots of younger siblings and we all sleep in one room.  5 of us in one room.<br /><br />Park:  Why does she wear those horrible clothes?  Maybe I should try and talk to her.  She has red, curly hair.  It looks soft.  Is she reading my book?  I think she is. Hmmm.<br /><br />Little by Little, Eleanor and Park become friends and fall in love on the school bus in 1986.  What evolves is a sweet tragic love story, told in the alternating voices of Eleanor and Park.  This book brought me back to my high school days and my own first love experienced in the 80's.  These two characters have stolen my heart.  Eleanor faces bullying and an abusive step-father and through it all, she knows she can count on Park.  Park is in love and wants it to be forever, but Eleanor knows it will end someday as all first love stories do.<br /><br />The audiobook has two narrators, one male and one female and they play the parts of Eleanor and Park extremely well.  I Loved it!  I would highly recommend this audiobook, it was definitely a great listening experience.  It kept my attention and brought the characters to life.  It will make you laugh and cry and cringe over the horrible things that Eleanor had to deal with.  The story is not sticky sweet but a real life type of love story.  Each character brings their own problems to the relationship and yet this relationship is Eleanor's only chance to escape the demons in her life.  Park exists to be Eleanor's serene, calm island, her safety net, in the middle of life's thunderstorm.<br /><br />I recently heard Rainbow Rowell speak about her book and she stated that Eleanor and Park takes place in her neighborhood, on her school bus and at her high school.  It took her a year to write Eleanor & Park.<br /><br />A note to the parents who banned Rainbow Rowell from visiting their school district:  I want to say thank you because it was you who caused me to notice and read Eleanor & Park and you, who made me want to see Rainbow speak in St. Paul and it was you, who inspired me to invite her to my high school to speak and it is you, I thank, as I continue to recommend this book to every teenager I know and teach.It kept my attention and brought the characters to life.

B00AN0KBJC|3.0|Don't like the amount of nudity but its a good show, but I kind of wish the pace would pick up a little bit.
1594746036|3.0|Miss Peregrine's is a good book with an interesting concept. I had high hopes for this book but it just fell short for me. I did like it and the pictures were a good fit, in my opinion, many times even mesmerizing. However, by the middle of the book I had to force myself to keep reading. The beginning was wonderful and had me turning pages all-night but somewhere the book lost that quality for me. After a consequential amount of time forcing myself to keep reading the fast paced action came again. The ending felt a little to fast paced, however, making me feel that Riggs kind of forced himself to finish. All in all the concept was great, the photos were intriguing, the cover is beautiful and the characters were interesting and likeable but not perfect, which made them real to me. It is the first book of a series and while I may read the second book I am not sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for it.
B002VL2PTU|5.0|He is the greatest pop artist and you can go ahead and say what you want about his personal life, but to see his work ethic in his performance is nothing short of amazing. Great film.
159514188X|3.0|13 reasons why was an ok book who had a great premise and a very interesting, creative, prose. However...<br />Hannah was not sympathetic at all in fact I would even go as far as whiny, self-absorbed, annoying, amd down right evil. Ten out of the twelve people (one person is there twice; Justin) did not deserve to live with the guilt of her suicide, which had in my opinion very little reason to had happened: Spoilers!! For example Alex, the boy said you were hot in what world is boosting someones self esteem bad less of all in high school where many people actually kill themselves for actual bullying; Jessica, a girl who is there because she was jealous that the guy she liked called you hot! Who was them by the way raped which you saw amd did nothing about! She had more legitimate reasons to kill herself than you; Jenny, a girl who was actually really nice to you and tried to be an actual friend but who had an accident that had terrible repercutions why! Why blame someone who was genuinely nice to you for your suicide. And at last her professor someone who is in the list because he did not run after her.<br />Another annoying part of this book was the fact that Clay was there at all why make him go thrpugh this and why are you there whinning about how no one cared and list someone who cared<br />Luckily the book was entertaining but after the hype created by previous readers it left me dissapointed. Really think Jay is a very good writer who just could not pull through. Suicide is a very serious subject that was taken lightly by a main character who just wanted others to feel bad and constructed an evil plan to damage the lives of many people who just did normal stupid teenage errors.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This is a solid product. Sleek design and Apple-inspired white color. Used this on a long road trip to charge iPhones and a Kindle Fire GD and did the trick. I was especially impressed with how quickly the devices charged. The Kindle charges slowly on a wall charge do my expectations were far exceeded by this charger. So far so good...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Book is a great read. Reminds me of the old John Grisham books that I loved so much. Highly reccommended
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am an addict. :) I find out news quicker from Twitter than any other source. Of course I still &#34;validate&#34; with other sources, however twitter is extremely helpful.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|It was something about this movie that made me watch it over and over and over again.  I saw it first on cable and then my sister bought the DVD for me.  Then I loaned it out to someone and they didn't give it back and I bought it from WalMart and someone borrowed it and then I ordered it from Amazon, that's just how much I love this movie.  It a family movie that is powerful and that you can just watch over and over and over again. If you are considering buying it, do so, you won't be sorry that you did.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I got the movie for the boys in my family they love it its not my idea of fun but heck not all can love everything!
B000002VMD|3.0|Love the movie just way, way, way too much cursing.  It's not a movie that I like to have in my home or a movie that you can watch with kids.  Whitney drops the &#34;F&#34; word like it's the most natural thing to do and for our household we found that to be pretty offensive. If it were not for the cursing, it would be okay because the songs were nice.
B00EUUIWZ6|5.0|Regarding the product description, the details clearly state &#34;Socket Supported: FCLGA1150&#34;. This is a powerful quad-core processor that runs cooler than ever before while completing tasks even faster than previous models. It's a boxed retail version so it carries a 3-year warranty, making it a solid choice for a fast workhorse computer or a gaming rig. The built-in graphics are very good for HD video/TV, Blu-ray, light gaming and it runs cool enough so you don't need a bunch of noisy fans in the case. As recently as 2 years ago this level of performance would have required a much more expensive, hotter-running Core i7.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|My son loves Back to the Future and this was a present for him. He had it put together in no time and has displayed it since. Everything functions liek it should and it looks great. The only issue we had was the characters do not quite fit in the cockpit. Other than that this is a awesome lego kit if you like legos and Back to the Future.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|Grand Hotel is the epitome of Hollywood glamour, and the best and brightest stars shine in this version.<br />One of the rare film outings that features John Barrymore and his brother Lionel as two of the leads.  As for Garbo, well, she is absolutely luminous here and the camera lighting is just terrific in every scene. She may have disliked the publicity hounds and having to endure occasional interviews, but Garbo certainly knew how to play to the camera.<br />Wallace Beery is his irascible self, though the bad guy in this tale, still you can't keep your eyes off of him.<br />Joan Crawford holds her own as the &#34;little stenographer&#34;.<br />Lewis Stone and Jean Hersholt round out the cast.<br />This is one of my favorite films from the 1930s!

0486406482|4.0|Oh, Emma. The book is a classic. I love the cover art. I love the price. I love the fast shipping. Let's see. What else can I say. The actual story is entertaining but I like other Jane Austen books better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!! It is completely addictive and almost all my Facebook friends play this game so I am always able to get more lives or advance.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. It always puts me in a good mood and leaves me in a calm state of being. Yet it also manages to make me feel deeply humbled to be alive and part of this world, no matter how horrible things may be sometimes. There is always hope.
B004G6009U|5.0|What a cute movie.  My adult daughter wanted this one.  We watched it with her 4 year old son.  We all really loved it.  Disney just can't be beat for the best movies for kids that also entertain adults, too.  I could watch it again.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I have a copy of this movie, and now my step grandchildren will also have copies for their entertainment enjoyment, and to pass on to future generations.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book.  Funny and very poignant.  I absolutely loved the characters and the humor used by them throughout the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book with really complicated ideas about government/s, authority, trust and really how the world is not black and white.  It's unfortunate that it has been geared toward children because I think these concepts are really not well understood at 12.  Nonetheless it is well written and impossible to out down-even on a second reading!
B0084IG8TM|1.0|One star is probably a little harsh - it IS a more or less competently mounted production outside of the risibly unconvincing CGI that has marred an entire generation of movies, and the frequent descents into unabashed silliness. (And it's nowhere near as wall to wall godawful as 'Snow White and the Huntsman.') But there are too many far SUPERIOR ripoffs of 'The Most Dangerous Game' out there for anything as insipid, dull and not infrequently just plain stupid as 'The Hunger Games' to get anything approaching a pass - most notably Kinji Fukasaku's instant classic 'Battle Royale,' comparisons to which are both inevitable and inevitably grossly unfavorable. ('BR' gets right down to business without a lot of filler and mush, for one thing, and the psychology of the characters is infinitely more accurate to the psychology of actual teenagers, e.g., the girl who lets her guard down purely because she is socially intimidated by a more popular girl.) It's also nowhere near as thrilling and engaging as the breakneck 1933 'Most Dangerous Game,' which is a sort of sister-film to 'King Kong' filmed on the same sets and also featuring the screams of Fay Wray. HG is expensively produced (and endlessly hyped) junk for young girls who have yet to discover real movies and (presumably, because I'll never read the book) real literature. Which is fine and dandy - I was way into the Batman TV show as a kid, so I take it for granted that younger audiences are drawn to swill. Just know going in that if you're an adult who has been exposed to the real thing, sitting through this soppy and frankly hard-to-swallow mess is going to be a tough slog. I'm pretty sure you have to be an initiate to appreciate it at all. And I've long passed the point of considering these fan bait franchise things they're churning out to be real movies. They exist to get undemanding and obsessed teens and arrested-development cases to part with their expendable cash, and they're generally exactly as entertaining as that assessment would suggest. I don't think an estrogen soaked version of 'The Running Man' for the acne set sounds like anyone's idea of a great time, but it does have its audience and it made money.
0761172726|3.0|it serves its purpose, good calendar for busy families. Will probably continue use it for a couple of more years.
B008CP6RWU|2.0|I was enchanted when I saw a snippet of this game. It seemed like an attempt at art in motion. It is beautiful, but really, just an aesthetic exercise. The main game (Journey) is breathtaking--especially if you have a high-quality, larger screen TV. But you can &#34;play&#34; the entire game in a long afternoon. There are very few variables and very simplistic point to the game. The environments are pretty much all the same. The other two games, while also beautiful, are nearly impossible to actually &#34;play&#34; because the motion in relation to the controller is so erratic. There are some bonus arcade games that come with the package, but they are odd matches to the main games and nearly unplayable themselves. All in all, these are &#34;games&#34; that I might expect as bonuses with another game. Certainly not worth the price.
0739384171|5.0|The 2nd installment is the best of the trilogy. it reaches its apex in the dramatic and heroic life of Lisbeth Salander. Her ability to protect herself and overcome her abusive and tragic past is inspiring for all woman who have suffered at the hands of a physical and/or emotional tormentor. She will forever be at the top of my list of powerful and empowering female warriors!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I like fables and myths. The forms are ancient and satisfying and so was this slim book. I loved powerful, magical, 11-year-old Lettie Hempstock. The 7-year-old narrator falls under her protection and, as he holds her arm during a particularly scary encounter, feels as if he's &#34;touching mighty engines.&#34; This is apparently Gaiman's return to adult novels, but I don't buy it. Only in the sense that to discover Lettie and the rest of the Hempstock women would be a powerful thing for a precocious reader on a long summer day.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It is more of a 4.5 for me. It is excellent, but I keep my scores of 5's for books that drastically and deeply affect my life.<br />It is a super intoxicating suspense book!
1400031001|4.0|Though he was a bit of a CAUC, I found that when I came to the end I cared about the loves and losses in LMS's life. \\"You must live the life you have been given.\\" Yes indeed.
B000TENKEK|5.0|Its literally the best album that the Gorillaz have ever made. There is not one song on this that I don't listen to. All the songs make me feel better when I'm down. And its just perfection.<br />Favourite songs has got to be Don't Get Lost In Heaven and Demon days.
0307476464|3.0|Aomame on Proust: \\"It's like I'm in a boat, paddling upstream. I row for a while, but then when I take a rest and am thinking about something, I find myself back where I started. Maybe that way of reading suits me now, rather than the kind of reading where you forge ahead to find out what happens.\\"<br /><br />I started this novel a long time ago and then set it aside after having paddled a hundred or so pages. After picking it up again and reading from beginning to end, I was deflated by the experience. It might have been better with a third edited out. But for me it would still fall short of some of his earlier works (Wind-Up Bird, Hard-Boiled Wonderland, etc.)<br /><br />I was waiting for the moment where I could smack my head and realize it had been clever, interesting, and magnum opus-like all along. Nope.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While the functionality is limited (would love to see some more apps support it), what it does it does well!<br /><br />Netflix works well - way less buffering compared to watching things on my Nexus 7.<br />Youtube works even better - love the fact that I can queue videos to watch on it!<br /><br />(Cannot test Hulu, since that is not available in this part of the world. Did not test streaming from Chrome - I have other options for streaming from my own network.)
0393343405|5.0|Outstanding narrative. Poggio's (and the other humanists') project of rescuing the remaining fruits of antiquity from dust is compelling. So too is the swerve served up in this story of the recovery of a remarkable poem. By the time I reached the end of the book, Jefferson's declaration of personal philosophy was mine as well: \\"I am an Epicurean.\\"
B003TSEEDY|5.0|But it's one of the best books I've ever read and I don't think ill ever go too long without revisiting it. Definitely one of my favorites.
0812982622|4.0|A fine, surprisingly lush narrative. So much storytelling in this North Korea where the unreliable state has overwhelmingly succeeded in forcibly suspending (deleting/refashioning/fabricating) the disbelief of its citizenry. The scene with the 8-year-old future interrogator and his dad on pp. 275-276 of the paperback caught me emotionally defenseless--especially as a father to a young son.
1439199396|5.0|This is a brilliant book.  The subject matter itself is fascinating but also the demonstration of the scientific process.  Read it.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I never thought I would finish this but once I got into the story I wanted to see who the good guy and bad guy were.  Held my curiosity until the last chapter.  Very funny main character, quite odd to be exact but when all the pieces fell into place, the whole reasoning made me feel so sad.  This poor young girl had so many phobias and was just one lost and lonely person.  When it unraveled it was amazing she could carry on but she did and she did it with determination.  If this is the 1st in a series I will be on the wait list for the following tales.  I liked this very much.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Jane Eyre (2011) 5 stars ★♥<br /><br />Based on the book by Charlotte Brontë. I read the book decades ago so what I remember is vague. I do recall liking Jane. I thought she was a strong female character. And that I wasn't to impressed with Mr. Rochester. The story was interesting. Focusing on Jane Eyre, a young orphan who becomes a governess to Adele Varens. I really imagined the Thornfeild mansion as a dark and gloomy place.<br /><br />This 2011 British movie was really good. Like I said, it's been a while since I've read the book so I couldn't judge on the comparison. I did think it was really good in creating the mood that the book has. The mansion was just as dark and gloomy as I thought it should be. I liked Mia Wasikowska as Jane. She kind of grew on me as I watched this. I think Michael Fassbender got me to like Mr. Rochester. I really liked him and thought he was the perfect Rochester. I also really liked Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers and Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax. They all did a good job. I've watched bits and pieces of it before today. Now I'm glad I watched this through. I really liked this. It's on my Christmas wish-list now.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I wondered why nobody got therapy. They lived near 1 st rate cities with great availalbe therapists. Just being practical.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Hobbs books are usually hard to put down anyway but this one was especially captivating. The story has so many twists and complexities of magic that create dire situations that the story pulls you in completely. Yet the descriptions and characters are so well written, you feel as if you are there.  I kept checking to see how much farther I had left to read, since I did not want it to end. And it doesn't. It continues in another book that I plan to read immediately.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|First rate movie in every way. The special effects are phenomenal, the acting is solid, and the story is incredible.This is a must have in anyone's library.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I usually find myself bored with the one-dimensional fluff we call movies these days, but this movie hit home, depicting what most do not understand to be the true nature of REAL heroes and those we often worship only in a positive light.  Mr. Washington's character in this movie was multi-dimensional, conflicted, deep and well-represented.  The story did not have a magic escape that left everyone feeling happy.  The movie did not jerk around from scene to scene like a meth-addict, but stayed with the characters and followed the story below its surface.  Well done.
0307730700|5.0|This was one of the most moving books I've ever read and once you read it, you will never forget it.  Raised in a small town in Arkansas, Adam Brown went through dark times with his drug addictions but overcame them.  While in jail, he realized that he needed help as drugs would always be calling him and he turned his life over to God.  He also had his wife Kelley and her deep belief in him and love for him.  When he joined the Navy, he wanted to excel at the best he could be and that would be the Navy SEAL.  The training was rigorous and tough on both Adam and Kelley.  But he persevered and became not only a SEAL but one of the best.  Even though he was injured many times, he kept on until the night of March 17, 2010 when a Taliban sniper took his life.  Back in the States, his son and wife felt something was off this day and when the knock came on the door, Kelley knew what it meant.  Adam Brown was a brave and courageous young man who wanted to be the best he could and he was.  He loved God, his family, and his country and died as a true hero.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is about a very disturbing situation.  However, the way it is written is amazing.  You are instantly drawn in, and it is an absolute &#34;can't put it down&#34; read!!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Pretty good and easy read. Was really disappointed with the ending. Moving on to`Sharp Objects` and hoping its ending will be better.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I loved all the details of death scenes. TV shows never show all of the tests that are performed at a crime scene. A cop, an FBI agent, a medical examiner and a computer genius give the reader many perspectives into the criminal's mind and behavior. I love all the characters in the Kay Scarpetta series of books. After reading all of Patricia Cromwell's books, I feel like I personally know Jay, Benton, Lucy and Marino. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This was a better movie than I expected. I recommend this, but not for children below about 14. Good Fun
B00004R99F|5.0|It is a great movie. It was/is my sister and I's favorite Disney classic.<br />R.I.P Baby Sis<br />I Love You<br /><br />Stand Out forever!!!!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|good movie, but overuse of cgi makes me lose interest, just like the transformers movies, getting away with cgi is difficult, movies look all the same these days
B000W1V5VU|5.0|I recently bought this on blu ray but wanted the dvd as well. Shipped and received in great condition. I nice completion to a series I really enjoy.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Could watch this over & over.......actually we have!  Love having it ready to view with the touch of a few buttons.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I use this app all the time. If I am watching a TV program and a song comes on I don't know I stop the show get out this app and it tells me immediately the musicians and the name of the song.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Cute, funny and witty. Not what I was expecting from a Harlequin book. I usually don't read them because they are usually so goody goody. This was an exception. Made me think differently about the Harlequin franchise.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|While the the story was great--international espionage ala Jack Ryan, I found something missing. This is not the 800 page Clancy thriller. This book was too short, it felt like a book written for quick sell.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was very powerful. The strength and hope that she had and still has after what she went through is remarkable. I love this book because it was so real .It touched my heart.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has been exploited.
0767919408|4.0|Wonderfully well documented history. Sometimes a little tedious but still interesting. Still, love reading Bill Bryson, one of my favorite authors.
6304698623|5.0|This was a great adventure movie for kids, with nice moral values and thoughts to boot.  it had an exotic side to the story, different than most.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these ear phones so much I can't even come up with the words. I can't use earbuds bec no matter what brand or size they fall out of my ears. After shopping everywhere on line and brick and mortar stores all I found were those hot uncomfortable ones with poor sound. These are fabulous. Like earbuds but the head band on top of the head holds them very well in place. I hated the kind with the band behind the head, just didn't fit right. These are So comfortable and the sound is great. I will DEFINATELY buy more. Some people say they don't last long. Not my experience. I use them at the gym and walking. Even if they didn't last long, I'd still buy more I love them that much.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not the type books I read. I was visiting for a weekend and the peoples internet was down they offered me Fifty Shades to read and I kinda laughed. Having nothing else I said ok, well, I was hooked and ended up reading the trilogy in less the 2 wks could not put it down... The sex got a little repetitive but the story was great can't wait for the movie..
B00992CF6W|4.0|I heard they are going to bring back mine carts and redstone and lots of other  stuff<br />.  Like the stuff on the Xbox edition of minecraft.<br />WHEN IS THE UPDATE COMING?
B003SJ4VJ6|3.0|I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it, but I wouldn't say it was the best movie. It is not for those people who want a resolution at the end, and it's not for people who want an action packed adventure. Ewan McGregor added some much needed humor. Also, with as long as it was, there should have been a little more time for character development.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME! This is one of my all time favorite game on the kindle fire. At fist it's really easy, but y'all won't know what `it you!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I saw it on ONDemand and I loved it! It was really fun and exciting and a really cool plot twist! I recommend getting the movie.
1451695195|1.0|I was SO eager to read this book. I have read numerous NDE books and enjoy reading about any \\"evidence\\" of an afterlife. I mean, really, who doesn't want to be assured of such?<br /><br />While I was reading the book, I noted that I felt strangely unmoved.  After completing it, I felt no different. The only distinct feeling that I felt? That I had been HAD. I began to read up a little bit about our dear Dr. Alexander. And, I now have to agree with many of the other negative reviews on here.<br /><br />First, let's be clear. He did not die. He alludes to slipping into a coma because his brain was so diseased. Although Dr. Alexander did mention the ER doctor that treated him (Dr. Laura Potter), he conveniently leaves out the fact that she PUT him into a \\"medically induced coma\\".  This is from Dr. Potter;<br /><br />\\"We couldn't work with Eben at all, we couldn't get vital signs, he just was not able to comply. So I had to make the decision to just place him in a chemically induced coma. Really for his own safety, until we could treat him. And so I did.... I put him to sleep, if you will, and put him on life support.\\" [...]<br /><br />\\"And of course he was still in an induced coma,\\" she says. \\"On ventilator support. They tried to let him wake up and see what he would do, but he was in exactly the same agitated state. Even if they tried to ease up, a little bit even, on the sedation. In fact, for days, every time they would try to wean his sedation--just thrashing, trying to scream, and grabbing at his tube.\\"<br /><br />I'm left wondering. If his brain wasn't functioning, even in the most primary way, how was he capable of attempting to scream and pull his tube out (every time they tried to ease him out of the coma)? Either way, with all of the other details he provides, how did he conveniently leave out the fact that the doctor PUT him into a \\"medically induced coma\\" in the first place? That is pretty pertinent information. I was also startled to find out that the doctors WERE able to start easing him out of the coma, but he was just too violent/agitated when they did. Hmmm...one might have to assume that these facts were intentionally omitted? Then again, I guess it wouldn't sound as \\"dramatic\\" as the picture he attempts to paint for his readers about being in a brain dead/vegetative state. These two very different stories don't seem to mesh well, do they?<br /><br />Other information that I discovered about his initial ER visit;<br /><br />\\"There's another detail taken directly from the book and fact-checked that will likely spark additional controversy. Alexander writes that he was groaning and wailing in the ER emergency room for two hours before he was sent to the ICU. After outwardly showcasing the pain he was feeling, he claims he went silent -- that is, until he appealed to the Lord.<br /><br />\\"Then, out of nowhere, I shouted three words. They were crystal clear, and heard by all the doctors and nurses present, as well as by Holley, who stood a few paces away, just on the other side of the curtain,\\" he wrote, noting that he said \\"God, help me\\" aloud.<br /><br />Now, while the neurosurgeon claims that this unfolded, Potter doesn't remember hearing these words. While it's possible she wasn't in the room at the time, there's another problematic detail: The emergency room doctor remembers \\"intubating\\" Alexander one hour before he headed to the ICU. With a tube placed down his throat and vocal folds, she doesn't believe he would have had the ability to speak at all.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander has been asked about this inconsistency, but as far as I know, has declined to reply. Why?<br /><br />He also slathers on his own praise, making himself sound like the most respected Neurosurgeon in the country.  That being said, it is disturbing that he failed to make mention of any of his malpractice, legal or financial issues. He allegedly tried to even alter patient records to hide evidence of surgery errors? Seriously? Are we supposed to think someone that would do such a thing is honest and credible? As stated by another writer (which I concur); \\"Considering that much of the doctor's afterlife story has been based on his standing as a renowned neurosurgeon, some might question if past legal battles surrounding his surgeries should have been included in the book\\".  I suppose if you cannot cut it as a doctor, an author is a reasonable second option?<br /><br />I only wished that I had read the negative reviews and researched Dr. Alexander more thoroughly PRIOR to buying his book. Instead, I gave my money to a man that appears to be making a fortune preying on individuals desperate to grasp proof of an afterlife.<br /><br />If there IS an afterlife, you have to wonder how someone that deceives others to make a profit will be received?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was very interesting to read. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because it seemed very wordy to me. The way he described his experiences. I did enjoy it regardless.
B008JFUPZI|2.0|Half-a$$ed special effects and just seems like a cheap Men in Black.  While Jeff Bridges is always fun to watch, it really just feels like his character from True Grit spilled over into this film.  Ryan Reynolds is just falling off.  The movie is fun, but you can't help but laugh at the lack of creativity at times.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not to easy but not to hard either. cant wait for more rooms. will be checking back soon. I can escape!
B0006HBU2E|1.0|Because no data is on this disk. It's blank. Neither of my &#34;Blue Ray&#34; DVD players will recognize this disk.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I used to play this game on Facebook, but this version for the kindle fire is way better!!!! The graphics are great, you don't use energy so you don't have to wait for it to refill, the story is kinda the same with more variety! I'm so happy they made the version for my kindle fire!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!!! Love it, play it all the time. Best game purchased through Amazon ever! Would totally recommend to others.
B004EYRIBC|1.0|Would love to rate it higher....if I ever get it.  Got 28 of the pieces and it stopped and claimed download complete. Do the math yourself and you will find there's a lot more than 28 songs. Not at all happy.  Was even stupid enough to try a second time and got no songs at all. Waiting to see if I'll get the $40 a pop refunded at least once and get the music that was promised. Music downloads turned to the dark side on this one.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I love this Movie! it is a Cult classic. I will watch it every time I see it on TV
B007FEFLTO|4.0|just as good as the first one...maybe better. the characters are great, and the stories are moving. can't wait for the final book!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|My husband is really the scifi/hero/Marvel fan, but I have to say this was actually a very good movie.  I am looking forward to more.
B008RLTUUA|4.0|Would have been twice as interesting if it was half as long.  But he does shine a light on a little known secret about our medications that everyone needs to be aware of.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|the story is beautiful. underneath it are many important teachings about love, dream, and life. there are also many Bible teachings.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham at his best. A page turner to the end. Good story GOOD ending. Felt as if I knew the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its great for the brain. Perfect amount of challenge. Once you  complete one level you will want to do more. Very addictive.
B00DS5YUV4|5.0|App is great for automatically handling some of the annoyances you have to do while using your phone. To give examples this is some rules I have come up with:<br /><br /> -Turn on data when I start certain apps (and WiFi is off)<br /> -Turn off WiFi when I leave my home<br /> -Turn on WiFi when I get home<br /> -Turn on Bluetooth when I get in the car<br /> -Play a sound when battery is full<br /> -Adjust screen brightness depending on the time of day<br /> -Set screen timeout to 15 minutes when I open Google Maps and back to 30 seconds when I close Maps<br /> -and that is only a handful of possibilities<br /><br />This app is much easier to learn than Tasker or any of the other similar apps I've tried. It also comes with a marketplace of user uploaded rules. I liked this enough to pay for the pro version because I felt it was worth the 2 bucks.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Fun game to play just wish you could beat the crew leaders without buying anything. Also wish there were no ads.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|After reading and loving The Kite Runner, I had great expectations for this novel. While it is a good book it is not great. Even though it has some physicality I will not forget there was something missing.  Miriam is a wonderful character but that's it.  I was looking for...hoping for ...more
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.... wish it was all free, but not complaining yet...<br />Kinda nice to have to wait between fights... makes the game longer t o beat.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A very interesting way to teach a lot of history in a funny way.  Reminded me of Forest Gump. The author should write history books for schools.
B00FAI2IUM|1.0|Unless you pay real money expect a very shallow experience. This game has the typical &quot;boosts&quot; and premium money that we have come to expect from free games. This wouldn't be a big deal if the game were actually exciting, however, the game is so basic that calling it anything close to authentic or realistic is laughable.  Driving physics are as basic as they can get with option of getting assistance both braking and steering. The graphics are good but don't expect to be blown away. This game reminds me why I don't rely on my tablet for serious games. I have rated this title 1 star due to the fact that it does nothing original and is only mediocre in almost all aspects, on top of that the game follows the typical freemium pay-to-win style that is plaguing mobile games.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|Whimsical, well-paced, romantic comedy with a terrific Hugh Jackman. Good chemistry between Meg Ryan and Jackman.  I admit that I am like time-travel movies and this is no exception, except most are science fiction/drama.  It is hard to find movies that the whole family can enjoy (no sexual content or violence).  Even my teenage son (14 yrs old) enjoyed it (he's an action/thriller fan).
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This book is so amazing it just pulls you in. I am not a huge fan of reading but this book is one that i love!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER! the bonus material is incredible and the film makers go live with the parallel story of how this movie relates to our 'modern' day reality of how we are destroying this wonderful (and only) planet we have to live on! LOVE the bonus stuff and longer movie versions with the deleted scenes in it! Great bargin
B009VSW15Y|1.0|How do you take a picture with this thing?  All you get is your own face, otherwise you cannot see the spot to touch to take a picture of someone else.  Don't care for at all.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Just another Godzilla type story.  Great special effects.  Formula script.  Ok for a few $$ rental on a cold cold wet day.
0385351399|3.0|Parts of this book were very riveting. Parts were unsurprising because it is the culture we are living in. But it seemed so hopeless, from the author's viewpoint. There were NO heroes. All succumbed. That I do not believe. I could have done without the sex scenes...hence I didn't pass it on to my children.
B00943SQCI|2.0|Was a fan of the original.  Like Johnny Depp.  Burton as a director, like half, dont like the other half.  The idea of this one had great possibilities in my mind.  Didnt even come close.  Glad I didnt see it on the big screen even at half price, would have left angry.  As a DVD rental, blah, dont bother.
0061339202|5.0|While reading the book I found myself underlining almost every sentence. Very insightful stuff. But now, 6 months after having finished reading the book, I find myself not &#34;remembering&#34; anything about the book. Or in other words, there was hardly nothing that one could implement into their daily lives. But it obviously is not meant to be a self-help book, and thus I would highly recommend it to anyone with an even slightest interest in psychology.<br /><br />Mihaly is clearly an expert. He knows the subject under review extremely well.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Special effects good.  Story line is thin.  Wouldnt be a blip on the radar except for Will Smith.  Its ok, rent it for a weekend when its cold outside and no sports are on.  :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragon vale is a game for all ages where you can get dragons and or breed them.  The best part is you can get every dragon just by breeding them so you don't have to spend money unless you are impatient.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|An excellent album by the most successful songwriter in history. I preordered the cd and  on the release date, I received the Autorip on my cell phone. So even though I didn't have the cd yet, I was able tolisten to it on the release date. I received the cd the next day. Excellent service from Amazon.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was a difficult read, but became compelling after the characters became a bit more clear.  There were a lot of &#34;main&#34; characters and I had to keep turning back to figure out who was who.  It was definitely not predictable, which is a big plus, but it seemed pretty contrived.  I am sure it will prompt some good discussion at my next book club meeting.
0375836675|5.0|I Am the Messenger was a jaw-dropping, and eye-opening novel that I couldn’t put down even when I was done. Ed Kennedy the main character, is followed by his perspective on things he’s doing and what’s going on in his life. It’s a very well-crafted book in how is shows how people who don’t really have nothing, through choices, can change others and their own lives around. As Ed life, and many others impacted from each one of his decisions.<br />  Markus Zusak writes a truly amazing novel of one man and his best friend and how the choices of our lives, change who we are. I really enjoyed the way he portrays the different struggles of family life and our mistakes we can change. Zusak has caused me to change my perspective on life. Since reading I have thought of my many decisions and ways to change my own life.<br />  I Am The Messenger creates a truly eye-opening perspective on our own lives and how we impact others. A book I recommend to anyone who wants a good read. I look forward to reading more of the books of this magnificent storyteller in the future.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Just when you think you know what's going on another twist comes in to play. Well written. A wonderful mystery.
0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a master of the unexpected and darker side of human nature. In Dark Places, readers witness a series of unrelated decisions that become interrelated events become enough circumstantial evidence to convict an individual of murder, a man willing to be convicted and spend years in prison. As his reclusive sister forces herself out of her self-imposed prison to learn what happened the night most of her family is slain, the reader becomes a witness to the redemptive quality in people whose decisions are horrible to contemplate yet in some way understandable. A small town tries and convicts a young man before he is ever arrested, a young man who got wrapped up with the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Gillian Flynn leaves her distinct mark on Dark Places. This is a must-read for lovers of the thriller and suspense genres.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A powerful story and with a lot of intrigue.  A great look at court dealings and lawyers.  Your books always have a surprise ending, John.  Really liked the outcome of this.  I recommend it to all readers.
B0060YIBLK|4.0|If you want to make more meaningful connections in your personal and professional life, this is the book for you.<br /><br />If you are hesitant to speak to others, the book provides step by step instruction that would make anyone feel less awkward in social situations.<br /><br />If you are already outgoing, this book will help you be even more successful in meeting people and learning about them.<br /><br />To me, this book says &#34;If you listen to a person you just met with care and interest, the other person will feel valued. If you listen to someone you already know, they will feel your love.&#34;  Whether you are in a professional setting, socializing casually at a party, or even finding romantic love, this book will provide you with everything you need to accomplish your goal.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|I'm still reading the book (chapter 2). What is strange for me is author creating new names for well known concepts. &#34;Reptile brain&#34; he calls &#34;croc brain&#34;, left and right parts of the brain refer to as &#34;hot cognition&#34; and &#34;cold cognition&#34;.<br /><br />With speeding ticket story I was expecting a solution how to overcome cop's frame, yet none were given. Hopefully its in the book later. Anyway I like the book so far and gave it 4 stars.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A hero you love,  and hate, at the same time. But you definitely will love him way more than you hate his actions. You find yourself being pulled into the story, wishing you were Abby and going thru the ups and downs that she did only to be able to get your happily ever after.  Anything worth having won't cone easy....
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I almost put this book on hold a couple times, but then something would happen to pick up the pace and grab my attention again.  It is a very unusual book, and hard for me to review in any meaningful way to help others who haven't read it.  I think most readers will be on the fence like I am.  It is worth reading to find out.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|A Very good movie, kind of cheesy but I like those kinds of movies. Was worth the purchase for me.
B001J710Y8|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars because there's no option for 6. Though come to think of it, I might have to reserve that sixth star for a good Director's Cut release, should such a thing ever hit the market. The studio was going through a change in ownership at the time, and apparently the new overlords felt such a need to prove they were &#34;in charge&#34; that they made pointless trouble and ridiculous demands every step of the way. And then AFTER filming, one of the new producers had the sheer gall to summon Christopher Lee (who had worked for FREE), along with his wife, to a meeting to discuss the end product, and then tell him point-blank that &#34;I think it's the worst film I've ever seen.&#34; (Okay, Sir Christopher may not have been a Sith Lord or a heavy metallist at the time, but I still think that guy was lucky to escape with his throat intact.)<br /><br />And yet STILL it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. (Unlike the horrid Nic Cage remake. Do yourself a favor and NEVER see that one, even if your favorite aunt or the object of your so-far-unrequited adoration is begging you to. I can only wish I could erase those memories. Now I know how Lemony Snicket feels. Seriously, just don't.)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Please fix it. It stopped about a week or so ago. Love the game.<br />I keep looking for a updates.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Very good movie. It maintained a lot of action. Good story line. Nice change in development over previous Superman movies.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Game says it needs an update. Won't update or open. Too glitchy. Has more than one issue constantly out of sync.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|This is an amazing album. I say that as someone who does not listen to the radio and does not really enjoy pop music. The spins and arrangements this amazing group puts on radio hits turns them into an incredible experience. Buy this album now, you won't regret it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Just perfect file explorer. It's everything you need and more. It's a &#34;must have&#34; app. It's needed if you need to install third party apps.
B00DV9QHB8|4.0|Sony’s release of the Prokofiev and Bartok piano concertos is these days kind of a quaint, old-fashioned, and highly welcome throwback. It’s a studio recording featuring a superstar soloist, a superstar conductor, a superstar orchestra, and a pair of superstar composers. It’s the sort of thing the big record companies used to produce almost on a monthly basis but now appear only in a blue moon. Economic conditions being what they are, about the only way to put together a star-studded cast is to record live, something that doesn’t always favor the best-sounding album. Whether the listener actually likes the new Sony disc seems almost beside the point; buyers need to prove to the record companies that there is still a profitable market for such items.<br /><br />The superstar soloist is the relatively young Chinese concert pianist Lang Lang, possibly the most well-known young pianist on the world stage today. Although Lang Lang has never impressed me as much as he has other people with his up-and-down, sometimes bland, sometimes mannered, sometimes exaggerated readings, there is no question he has the measure of the Prokofiev and Bartok pieces on this disc. The superstar conductor is Sir Simon Rattle, a man whose work seems to me a little less energetic and electric than it once did but whose maturity and close attention to detail still produce music worthy of hearing. The superstar orchestra is the Berlin Philharmonic, an ensemble beyond reproach that continues to dazzle the listener with its rich, lustrous perfection. And the superstar composers are Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) and Bela Bartok (1881-1945), two of the most-prominent innovators of the twentieth century.<br /><br />The Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3 in C major, Op. 26 comes up first, and the performers do their best job with it. The composer completed it in 1921 from sketches he began in 1913. Of his five completed piano concertos, the Third is among the most lyrical and melodic, doubtless contributing to its popularity. It begins slowly and softly, quickly building up a head of steam with the piano’s entry and becoming ever more rhapsodic and tempestuous through its three movements. If I still prefer Martha Argerich’s performance with Claudio Abbado (DG) and Byron Janis’s with Kiril Kondrashin (Mercury) for their greater involvement and dynamism, Lang Lang’s treatment of the work is, nevertheless, refreshing.<br /><br />The concerto gets off to an easygoing start but quickly picks up a head of steam, which Lang Lang carries out admirably. While he seems a little more cautious with it than some musicians, it blends nicely with the lyricism that comes after it. Then, too, we can probably thank Maestro Rattle for the careful, meticulously warm yet detailed accompaniment. The Prokofiev Third is, after all, one of those concertos where the orchestra plays almost as big a part as the soloist. I enjoyed Lang Lang's virtuosic skills quite a bit here, even if he doesn't seem as attuned to the work's more playful passages as he could be. Still, the finger work is so dazzling, one can't argue with the results.<br /><br />The work's second-movement theme and variations sounds particularly pleasing, Lang Lang and Rattle both taking their time to develop the music. It's nicely airy and ethereal in the outer sections and properly rambunctious in the faster segments. Maybe Lang Lang approaches it a bit more Romantically than some other pianists, but it's an effective, seductive Romanticism, punctuated as it ought to be with outbursts of modern dissonance.<br /><br />In the final Allegro Lang Lang is at his best, playfully dancing along on the keyboard while the Berlin orchestra bounces along in glorious partnership. This is the Prokofiev that always comes to mind when I think about the man's music. It is energetic, exuberant, witty, rhythmic, poetic, rhapsodic, clearly into the twentieth century yet easily accessible. And Lang Lang, Rattle, and the Berliners give us the best of everything.<br /><br />The second selection on the program is Bartok’s Piano Concerto No. 2, which doesn’t come off quite as well as the Prokofiev but is still quite good. In the Bartok, Lang Lang shows off his technical dexterity to even greater fashion than in the Prokofiev, possibly because the work demands it. The pianist's hands are ever on the move; I don't think there's a moment in the opening movement that the soloist is at rest. It's also a little harder to come to grips with Bartok's pulsing rhythms and relentless forward drive than it was with Prokofiev's more-forgiving, more melodic concerto. So if Lang Lang seems a bit more distant to me in the Bartok, it's probably not the pianist's fault so much as it is the composer's.<br /><br />Sonically, we hear good depth to the orchestra, a good ambient bloom to the hall, a good breadth to the image, and a good integration of the piano and orchestra. The dynamic range is wide, the bass and treble strong, and the impact more than adequate. However, it's not one of those recordings where the sonics knock you out. It's much more natural than that, especially if you set the playback at an appropriate level for maybe a tenth row center seat. Although the sound doesn't display the kind of transparency we hear on some audiophile recordings, it's hard to fault Sony's work on any count, it's so lifelike.<br /><br />John J.

B00BEF1AEK|3.0|Good game. Some instructions at begining would be fine. There is no way out of the game. If you hit back button it just pause the game. It must be a option to clean exit of this app.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love everything about this story. In my opinion it is perfect. It is the only book I have found that I can read it again as soon as I finish.<br /><br />Read this book!
B005FPT51K|4.0|This camera is honestly great.  Setup was a breeze.  Simply watch the youtube video they have online and you wont have any trouble.  I really appreciate the fact that I can pull up the baby monitor from anywhere on my Iphone, Ipad, etc...  You dont have to be on the wifi to use it<br /><br />I only have two gripes about this product.<br />1) they dont yet have an iOS application for my MacBook.  Not the end of the world, but if you were intending on watching your baby sleep from you MacBook, you'll have to wait until they release new software.<br />2) You have to hook up external speakers if you want to be able to talk to your baby.  Again, not the end of the world, its just one more item that I would need to hook up and attach to the wall.  I personally will probably not use this feature, but I might buy an additional camera to use as a secturity camera.<br /><br />Otherwise, Its great!
B00ESH04LQ|5.0|I teach 12th Grade English and it is soooo wonderful to have an adaptation that uses the actual language from the original play. This students are absolutely fascinated and enthralled by this movie. It's so great to see them so interested in Shakespeare. Thank you to Joss and the amazing cast for putting this together. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm so happy to be able to share Shakespeare with my students and have them actually respond to it so positively.
0316174483|5.0|A great book for parents of toddlers or for educators. A fun way to design cards and crafts. Encourages creativity.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|I'm a sucker for great memoirs, nonfiction and this is right up there with some of the best I've ever read. I first heard about this when I saw the trailer for the movie directed by Scorsese, starring DiCaprio. Then as I started looking into the story i became very intrigued with it. So i purchased the book and I'm so glad I did. Great story and I would say great characters, but they are all real people. Really shows how for some people money can be everything and how it can cost them everything in the end. Bits of Wall Street and bits of Less Than Zero.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read! As a reader who identifies and &#34;gets to know&#34; characters, I've always wondered about Danny Torrance.... Was he a good man? Did he lose his mind? In this novel, King provides readers with a much appreciated bit of closure. Those of us who sat in the dark of our bedrooms reading The Shining by flashlight while biting our nails down to the quick needed this. Thank you, Mr. King.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It loads very quickly and let's me know when crafts are ready to be collected. It has easy to read directions and it seems to work with no issues so far.
0956721591|4.0|Easy to read and follow along with. As someone else mentioned, the pictures are black and white instead of color, but assuming you're purchasing it more for the bilingual aspect, the pictures are just adding to it anyways. Came with audio CD, haven't listened to it yet.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was the same age during WWII . It was the story of a girl who was supposedly the enemy. We in this country on ever thought of the Nazis as real human beings. In the book you had a feel of what life was like with the war in your backyard.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It's just amazing. And loooooong. But if you like to read, you won't mind. It is gripping enough to be a good beach read, but complex enough that's it's not really in that beach-reading category. Other reviewers will analyze the plot and characters, but suffice it to say, the people in the book are so real, they are like people you know, or good friends you wish you know, and you really wish would get on the wagon. Tartt's portrayal of a kid going through high school, her depiction of overly bright people who can fail to &#34;reach their potential&#34;, her vision of Las Vegas as well as the city ... just amazing. It's a modern day Catcher in the Rye - what Holden would do if pharmaceuticals were within reach, and if he were burdened by a secret possession of a work of art so beautiful, it changes all who encounter it. btw this is the first book I've ever reviewed, or even wanted to bother with reviewing. i'm only doing it to counter those people who didn't appreciate it.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Worth reading but figured out the ending.  Not riveting or not to be missed, however it was worth reading and I recommend it.
B00BU18U82|2.0|My 4.6 yr son wanted and needed this game. He was done in 5 minutes. I will honestly say that I didn't check the age requirements but I was done in 2 and had no interest to learn. If you love farming and such this might be good and your child is older than mine.
B00E1LAS42|4.0|I personally didnt care for the movie but the others I watched with enjoyed it.  I honestly dont remember much of the movie.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|You cannot go wrong with any DR panda game and toddlers. We have all of them and our constantly played
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I fricken love this movie and basically any movie starring Nic Cage so my star rating is kind of biased. Buy this movie. Or don't. Your choice. (Oh yeah, Idris Elba is in this movie and he is great.)

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I tried to fight the urge to play this game but when my husband asked me to try to beat a level he was stuck on the addiction started. I continued with denial of the addiction by only playing the game on his phone. Now I downloaded only on my kindle refusing to spread to my other devices(for now). I have so far determined I have to get three stars on every level before moving on so it's taken me longer but more rewarding seeing all the 3 stars. I have also kept it a secret by not connecting to Facebook(also for now). I'm doomed and I blame it all on my husband! So much fun!!!!!
B000GG4XJM|5.0|I love this CD and something happened to mine so I had to replace it.  A must for a Seeger and Springsteen fan.

0142410314|5.0|My most favorite book of all time.<br /><br />seriously people who say Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory are 1 - jerks and 2 - stupid.<br /><br />while the original movie is amazing that garbage Burton and that socialist Depp made are AWFUL. DO NOT SEE THAT.<br /><br />Gene Wilder 4 lyfe.
B000YDE46Y|4.0|It was bigger than expected, They might run big.<br />But as for my boyfriend they were a little big. so had to return them.<br />Thanks
B004GHNIRK|5.0|If you bother to read anymore, read this. If you never were required to read this in High School, you probably went to a crappy public school. This book is the real deal, Hugo wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />The movie sorry &#34;musical&#34; versions of this book are horrid - DO NOT WATCH. However, the story itself is simply outstanding.<br /><br />Also - Russel Crowe cannot sing - see the other version (if you must).
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I cried, I laughed, I cried again. I re-read sections because i was just in disbelief. I really didn't expect this ending. I loved it (w/missed emotions).
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|Please see earlier comments/review about Killers.<br /><br />This was a gift... dude liked it. It's on a shelf. I guess that's what you do when you already know every song and have listened to this album a bazillion times.
0756697875|4.0|Brought this for my nephew as he is a big fan of Lego and Batman. We read it all the time. Only con is most of the thickness of the book is space to hold the minifig.
B009F1ZYQK|5.0|Funny story.<br /><br />This was on a wishlist so I bought it. It came a week later. Two days later I got another copy. Panicked, I went online to be sure I didn't order two copies, because seriously, who needs a backup album when you already have the CD and TAPE (yes, tape!).<br /><br />But then the real joke started. I got another copy. THEN ONE MORE. So yes, FOUR COPIES OF KILLERS. I decided to give Amazon a call and we worked it all out, I mean for a while there I just assumed the universe was trying to tell me something.<br /><br />it all worked out in the end and of course, it's a KILLER albume. Zinnnng.
B0088EDMMS|4.0|I loved this movie since I was a kid and I've been wanting to share this with my niece and nephew.
014241011X|5.0|I was told there is a movie about this book and it's not very good.<br /><br />I love Dahl's books and prefer to keep this one in my mind as it is and not some crap movie that no one liked.
B004HW7JI8|4.0|this show get better by the minute and the mystery keeps getting more crazy and twisted until new twists are revealed.
0385486804|4.0|If you like Krakauer's other books... (SOLID BUMOUTS BUT GOOD STORIES) you'll like this.<br /><br />I read Into Thin Air first.<br /><br />It's only ok.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I loved the series when it was on originally.  Looking at it again, I still love it.  I remember I was so upset when the series ended.
0142410373|5.0|Matilda is a handful but that makes for a great story. I do love her.<br /><br />I would read this book again and again - especially to children who like to be fiesty.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I originally loaded this game for my son he's turning 3 &amp; my daughter she's 7 they both just love Iron Man but now I find myself playing it more then they do lol Great game for all ages love the graphics and I don't feel sick playing this game for a long time lime I do with some of my other Kindle Fire HD games.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Austen is something, ain't she?<br /><br />I mean honestly, her books are always so pretty.<br /><br />The broads in them always piss me off - but Jane is like that when she describes dames. You'll probably hate it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is fun and a addicting...was over way too fast. I breezed through the levels and wanted more. I agree that it needs some sort of introduction at the start of the game.<br />Overall, fun game. Challenging puzzles.
1401223176|5.0|This was on a gift list... so yeah it's probably never been read.<br /><br />But if you like Batman and cool covers, this is probably one to get.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|This game lags so bad i still hve plenty of space too it crashes all the time please fix this.....because i love this game....luckily it was free
1401232590|5.0|Also a gift like the other Batman thing Hush.<br /><br />Probably never been read but again, if you like Batman and cool Batman things, buy this.<br /><br />Batman is in it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|The mouse is comparable to the logitech G500. It is much cheaper, and performs similar. I am happy with it.
0345803493|3.0|Read my other review on this - DULLARDS.<br /><br />Boring.<br /><br />do not read - do not see the movie. 2/10. simply poor writing.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This was given as a gift.  I haven't received any feedback on it yet, so I' m assuming it must have been an okay movie.  If it wasn't good, I'm sure I would have heard about it. :)
0345803485|3.0|Ok - seriously.<br /><br />So a coworker told me &#34;omg you have to read these books&#34;. I come on the ol Amazon and order the three together and they're all like dude you gotta wait 2 weeks we're sold out. This was at the beginning when it was all the rage.<br /><br />I get the dang books... I blow through the first one in about a day because the writing is so bad, the Flesch Kincade stats are like 7th grade. The S&M is inaccurate and really ladies, Mom Pr0n? come on.<br /><br />We can do better than this in Hustler or latenight Cinemax. If the movie version ever gets finished, I'll be bored to tears unless they add some circus tricks or some midgets.<br /><br />2/10
B006M4F67A|3.0|I actually haven't had time to play this particular version of the game yet. If it wasn't for this request to rate it, I probably would have forgotten that I have it. As you can probably tell, I'm not much of a gamer, but when I do game, it is usually Mahjong.  Looking forward to playing it, now that I have been reminded that I still have it. LOL!
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's a good game but I wish it was interactive.<br /><br />Say - I could play someone else on the network....<br /><br />But it's cool when I'm sad and lonely and need to do something.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I've been having a hard time getting these to work.  I only use them on Skype.  However, I did find a place where I needed to allow Skype to recognize them before I could use them.  I haven't used them since I allowed Skype to recognize them, so not sure if they work now.  I will be trying them in the future again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you don't like this show you are either a jock or just a horrible person.<br /><br />Seeing how maids and upper crust live is so amazeballs.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|maybe it's my network, but the Chromecast buffers a lot.  I love the idea, and set up is easy, plus the interface from ipad is easy.  But just need to address the lags.
0142410349|5.0|Oh yes - Mr. Fox is foxy.<br /><br />Read this to kids and you'll be the hero. I love Roald Dahl and all his stories are so fancy. You'll love him too.
B0056JJXOO|5.0|I love this movie! Only buy it if you r into girly movies and chick flicks! But that's my opinion!!!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Hi - this is a free ebook I got for my kindle.

B00E0KPG7S|4.0|I have been a Depeche Mode fan for many, many, many, many moons now and can safely say they are one of bands responsible for providing \\"accreditation to the remix\\".  Now the following statement will be totally subjective among DM fans, but I think the last batch of quality remixes fall somewhere between \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\".  I am not counting bootleg mixes, remixes found online or underground remixes.  I am strictly talking about studio/officially promoted by the record label \\"remixes\\".<br /><br />This brings me to this remix EP/maxi single of \\"Should Be Higher\\", the third single from \\"Delta Machine\\".  Penned by Dave Gahan and Kurt Uenala this song is certainly one of the highlights of the album.  The song itself has a medium pace, a wonderful beat and great chorus.  Actually, this song was screaming for the \\"remix\\" to come along and transform it.<br /><br />I have to say that this maxi single is both disappointing and satisfying.  It is disappointing because two of the mixes seem really mismatched with the integrity of the source material.  The Grinderman remix is a hard rock-ish mix that isn't bad but the vocals at time don't seem to match with the music.  The Jim Jones mix is very difficult to gage.  It sounds like Dave Gahan's vocals are trapped in a Pulp Fiction/1960s surfer tune and it seems like the vocals and music never really seem to match.  Notwithstanding, I find it refreshing that both of these mixes tried something different, instead of using a drum machine and repeating the same line or word for seven minutes.  There are more Depeche Modes mixes than I care to count that is guilty of this ruse.<br /><br />The Little Vampire remix and Maps remix are both good too; I favor the latter due to the dreamy soundscape that mirrors the original version.  And these versions also use all the original vocals.  As for the radio mix, it is a condensed version of the album mix with a few variations that make it different just enough to be unique in its own right.<br /><br />It would have been awesome if a live version were on this single.  Mainly due to the fact that the video for this track is a live performance and the sleeve is taken from a video that is displayed behind the band when they perform \\"Should Be Higher\\".  I can happily say first hand that I saw DM on tour this past September and \\"Should Be Higher\\" was in the set list.  It was one of the highlights of the show, again it would have been a welcomed addition to this single.br /><br />It would have been awesome if a live version were on this single.

B009APMNB0|3.0|I've always owned Do-It-Yourself Color Calibration Screens, like ViewSonic, or Photo Software, where you can self adjust the color yourself, which is very time consuming having to match color cards with your screen, so I was looking forward to this Colormunki Smile Simple Automatic Monitor Calibration.  I do a lot of photography for a collectibles magazine, where I need really sharp, bright photographs and for family history, where I have to do a lot of repair work on old photos, both color and black and white.<br /><br />This is by far the easiest monitor screen calibration I have ever used. The contents are 3 items- the Colormunki Smile, Quick Start Guide and the Software CD. You begin with only the software CD. I have Windows 7 and this went very smoothly and quickly. Once the software is installed, you simply plug the Colormunki Smile into a USB port. Next, you just launch the software and follow directions. The Colormunki Smile simply sits on the front middle of your screen and it has a counter weight you adjust in the back so it sits level. It has a foam pad backing so it doesn't scratch your screen. The rest is automatic and taking only about 6 minutes from start to finish- it couldn't be simpler.<br /><br />Once the calibration process is finished, you can instantly see before and after calibration photos to see the results of Colormunki Smile. I found it very helpful to restore my monitor to it's factory default before using the automatic calibration, as I did it both ways and the results were better beginning the calibration with my default settings. I actually printed out a photo of the before and after photos, and the colors for me were very average- good skin tones, but no real vividness or super sharp colors which I need for my collectibles magazine photos. The colors were on a soft, natural scale, where I need more vivid sharp colors, so for me this is a very easy to use monitor color calibration that gave me very average colors. This Colormunki Smile would be great for someone just wanting an easy software to calibrate their colors on their monitor for non-professional use.would be great for someone just wanting an easy software to calibrate their colors on their monitor for non-professional use.

B0036EH40Q|5.0|Wow, don't even really need to say much here! Amazing movie! I'm actually reading the book now, and the movie hit several things to the detail! Obviously we don't know the actual facts. But...from what I'm reading from the book, dead on! Only thing I've heard different, Ike's family says it was totally opposite. Which we'll never know, so I just go to the flick! WHICH IS AWESOME!!! Val Kimer...best acting he's ever done hands down! I actually feel bad for Quaid in Wyatt Earp. He did a fantastic job, but nothing will ever beat Val as Doc Holliday!
0142410322|5.0|I mean this is what it's all about.<br /><br />Charlie doesn't mess around (well, he does actually but .. you know)<br /><br />Greatest books ever written for kids.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Great book from the prospectus of the German people during world war 2.  Great characters and great narrative.<br />I really enjoyed this book.
0671027344|5.0|Book good - movie bad.<br /><br />I read this book and couldn't believe it. I just fell in love. I mean it's sad times - but in a good way that you can identify with. If you're an angsty confused teenager.<br /><br />or a creepy adult who likes to relive the 90's.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Works good, solid not flimsy. Plenty of space between each slot for USB items. Like the blue L.E.D. color. Perfect.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|No surprises, it is what it says it is. Easy to use, reliable, I don't use it all the time, but works when I do.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Graphics are alright but not that impressive overall. Everything comes pretty much pre-built (all you have to do is fix it) so that is pretty disappointing because the fun in these games are buying and upgrading, Watching your small building become a masterpiece. To be honest, It's painfully generic and offers nothing that dozens, if not hundreds, of other apps already offer. The only reason I downloaded it is because it gave me 100 coins for doing so.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This is a fun and challenging little game. A bit on the bizarre side with a rock headed guy slinging rocks with his tongue, but hence the name, &#34;King Oddball&#34;. This is a lot of fun, neat strategy and quite different!
B00CEF014E|5.0|This is the first book of Damian Stevenson I have read and I am impressed. It is a horror novel with mood and atmosphere simply fascinating and scenes described with incredible detail. Solstice is one of those page turners  that are thrilling right from the start and you just cannot put down.<br />Although I wish it was longer, I strongly recommend this intense story to anyone who loves mysteries and psychological thrillers - it is  well written,  unpredictable and makes you  forget everything else.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game with cool graphics. Awesome for kids adults. Add to your list of games today! It's not the movie, but cool nonetheless.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|There is no story like Game of Thrones.  GRRM creates a world unlike any other. This isn't just another LOTR copycat. It is part historical fiction, part science fiction, and part fantasy.  With characters that all have their own very detailed back story and individual motivations.<br /><br />Very few are good or bad, most are grey; you can't decide who to love or hate and no one is safe. Characters live and die based on chance and the whims of the powerful. Some heroes die and some villains live.<br /><br />Everything is raw and uncensored, just as life is. He doesn't sugarcoat sex or war. He lays it out the way it is and puts it in an intriguing and ever-changing universe.<br /><br />More importantly, while I was undergoing cancer treatment, a friend asked him if he could send some books to get signed as a gift for me. Instead, GRRM sent him 5 signed books, including a special edition box set of &#34;A Game of Thrones,&#34; each inscribed with a personal message for me.<br /><br />So, not only is GRRM one of the greatest writers of our time, he is also a good man.

For example once you buy RCs and want to use them to get fertilizer or other aides to progress in the game, there is a message coming up saying your game is out of sync and has to be refreshed once you hit ok it will refresh and then you will have to go back and get the fertilizer again and do the same action again. The other day the same thing happened again yet this time a job that I had already completed I had to redo all over again very frustrating. Now the game every time I try to open it and play it says that an update is needed so I click on ok and it takes me to the App store yet there is nothing in the Appstore that indicates any update only that you already own the game again very very frustrating. Please fix those bugs. Other than that the game is awesome. Maybe more variety in gaining game money to use verses having to use real cash would be great.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|AMAZING! Simply Amazing Movie!<br />This is the best of the best movies I've seen n a long time! Henry Cavill is even better as superman then he wa as Theses in Immortals......n it doesn't hurt if he is the cutest thing(very handsome)! The whole cast ensemble was great. I liked that the story told more about his background n his race.....wth Russell Crowe as his father, wow! Very impressive. I wl definitely b purchasing it to view &#34;anytime&#34; I want! I actually watched it 4xs. Can't wait to see what the next chapter wl b........
B007SGM084|5.0|Despite too much sexual description for my taste there is a beautiful love story that develops by the end and it is well worth reading it through.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|A great album and a truly historical event.  This concert was one for the books.  Buy it if you love Cream.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it it so much fun my parents say I play it to much.<br />But they need to make so when you are making something really big in survival you can switch it to creative and then back to survival that would be cool. But I still love this game.
B007V65R54|4.0|Silver has a fantastic mind, but his writing definitely needs some occasional polishing. The ideas presented in each chapter are great, and his goal (an understanding of Bayesian thinking and how it can better prepare us for the unknown) is noble; unfortunately, his writing -- in particular, his attention to detail that can sometimes be overkill -- tends to diminish his ability to get his final point across.<br /><br />In all, a great read, and is definitely recommended, but it just doesn't read quite as &#34;smoothly&#34; as it could have.
1451695195|5.0|This is an incredible book to start with and now I'm buying it for friends. I've read other books relating to near death experiences, but with Dr. Alexander sharing his experiences intermeshed with the purely scientific aspects related within was fascinating and made this the BEST book I've read on the subject!  I'm finding this work of art helpful in sharing positive thoughts to my elderly mother as she frets over what's to come after her life comes to an end!  Don't hesitate to buy and share this with others!
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Totally absorbed in this book. The gold rush in NZ comes alive through the skilfully created characters & atmosphere. Excellent.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a cute time passer but cant really spend any time playing in the beginning. There isn't enough to do.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable along with the power charger is great, make the investment. The 5ft cord is great not too long and not to short. Try it!!!!!!!!!!
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|I just got this card, and it's a fantastic single GPU Solution. I was going to opt for two R9 280x Hawaii Island cards, but since they are out of stock, I decided to take my money elsewhere, and this led to me to the GTX 780.<br />GPU Architecture is the GK110, which is also used in the Big brother card, the TITAN! Which is awesome. I Literally call this card the Kawaii Titan if you get what I mean.<br />It'll eat up any game that's out there, if you're the &#34;Gotta, have my 60 frames!&#34; Techie then I suggest this card.<br /><br />As for the promo's that amazon doesn't state on the card information, the &#34;Holiday Bundle&#34;, it actually does come with it! You will get an email with the codes to redeem on Nvidia's site. Super glad with my purchase.<br /><br />The only con I have is, even with 1-day shipping it still takes too long~ ( My impatience kicking in.)

030759565X|5.0|This cookbook, along with her website, has become our cooking bible in the kitchen.  My wife and I have been fans of Deb's blog for years, and this cookbook brings everything we loved about her website into an organized cookbook!  Every special event, every party, we consult with Deb for delicious ideas of what to make.  We have even had pot lucks with friends where every single dish was inspired or taken from Smitten Kitchen.  Deb breaks down recipes into their most basic instructions and gives useful commentary about what chances she made and why she did it the way she did.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The music and the musicians are fantastic. They seem to be down-to-earth and genuine, and not so much into &#34;the game.&#34;  It seems that they just want to play their music, like the folk artists of the late 60s, and aren't as interested in becoming millionaires or producing a glossy act.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been stated? But ...WOW! Best app in this genre yet! It can be a little frustrating. But the payoff for the right moves is worth the frustration! Thanks!
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far so good, but it is hard to understand all the gadget on the side of the screen and to be able to use them
B009CVRQLY|1.0|I suppose if one tried hard enough, you could make the greatest voice of our lifetime sound like every other third-rate artist out there. Well these folks have succeeded big time, it's a dreadful album from start to finish.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Celine's work since the early French albums, up through &#34;Taking Chances&#34;. Ms. Dion can surely command the best songs and producers in the world. What the h*** happened here?<br /><br />Her voice is amazing as always but the songwriting here is truly lousy, and lousy on an epic scale.  The tracks are overproduced and jammed full of uneccesary noise. For crying out loud, y'all can surely afford to hire a real grand piano instead of that cheesy synth piano that &#34;boings&#34; through the entire album, what were these producers thinking?<br /><br />To be honest I could not get all the way through any of the tracks with out clicking forward in abject disappointment.<br /><br />&#34;Seventeen&#34; was a pointless remake of a classic hit, who's bright idea was that?<br />Stevie Wonder's duet was just silly and the ridiculous string arrangement is an embarrassment. He must really need some cash to have signed off on this mess.<br /><br />Dear John Doelp, Sony Music execs, and I'm sorry but even you Celine... I'd like my money back please.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fantastic game, it keeps your brain constantly working. Great game for just about any age. Keeps you on your toes as many levels can be very difficult to achieve.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun and bought more lives like three times now. Also I play till my battery dies.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It is visually stunning and even if it had no story at all, it would be worth watching. But good news! It has a story and an endearing one at that. Without giving away too much, it's about love, storytelling and the power of a child's imagination. The acting is superb, especially that of the young female lead who makes the movie with her persistence. It begins in a 1920's hospital, but soon you are transported far away to an enchanting adventure. This movie is rated R, but I think it's just because of some implied drug use. I could be wrong though; I haven't seen it in a while. I definitely think most 12 year olds and up could handle it, and would enjoy it.  I recommend this movie to young and old, to anyone who believes in the power of love, friendship and adventure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so so so much! Everyone should try it. Super game. Love it love it love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for a long time. I had to play on my Iphone until Kindle Fire made this available. Thanks
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you liked the first book, I do not recommend this one. I read the first two books in a single day, but it took me two days to force myself to slog through this one. I felt it was disappointing for a number of reasons. The storyline was anticlimactic and not at all engaging, using random deaths/injuries to create sub-par drama that did not fit in with the fluidity of the previous two books. There were large portions that didn't lead anywhere and seemed like they were filled in as an afterthought to gain more pages. The romance between Four and Tris is .... flat. At best. A half-hearted attempt at edginess gives us the two of them sleeping side by side or feeling under shirts--- which is a change of pace from the same-old &#34;kissing is the be-all end-all&#34; you usually see in young adult fiction, but its delivery was awkwardly empty of emotion.<br />I have read better stories that were 1/10 the length from high school kids. Allegiant was not engaging, nor enjoyable, and sacrificed obvious character-development opportunities and a cohesive storyline for fluff. If you can even call it fluff. That said, the only good thing about this book is that I finished it and can now delete it from my Kindle and pretend that the whole story ended with Insurgent.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  I enjoyed all of her harry potter books so much.  Too many characters with too many problems!!  The only good thing about the book was our book club had a good discussion!!!!!  Such unhappy people!
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Brilliant masterful work I recommended this to everyone. I had no idea he wrote science fiction I found this book just searching threw the top books in the genre.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is great the animation and all is great but I would REALLY REALLY REALLY like to see a Vietnam War guns in one of their apps
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|A very good album.  I like Mariah Carey A LOT, and this album really provided me with what I wanted to hear during her recording hiatus!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I like this album except for the rapping.  I just don't like rap.  You need to listen to the album completely to appreciate it.  The samples at first sounded like random noise to me, but the album actually is great sounding. I hope people are not put off by just what they hear from the samples. The first real pure pop/dance album that I ever bought was The Fame.  Lady Gaga is that good that she got me to pay attention to pop/dance.  I love all of her records. Artpop is her first album that I bought digitally.  The amazon mp3 sounds good.  I could not pass up the $5.99 price!
B0068MNO4S|4.0|This is a great movie that builds on the theories surrounding Shakespeare's true identity.  It provides interesting fodder for debate.

B004K4AVAG|5.0|Tell me why you love this dynamic lady, talented as ever. i love that she is her own drama queen. And Queen she is. I love every sone on this cd. I just love her being a performer of the year.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|As an avid magic player of five years, I was let down by the last few games put out. There was no rhyme or reason to the decks. This game left me very surprised. The decks are great, the enemy's are challenging. The trial version gives a nice taste.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|O.K...this  was another gift to my nephew who is really a die hard Wiz Khalifa fan. I also like his music . My nephew has a birthday near Christmas, so I gave him both cd's as gifts.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Just as if I bought it at a retail store.  I love the Big Bang Theory.  I now have every season.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Never heard of these musicians before until the CMA Awards. I love their song CRUISE. And I when I played the cd, I found that I love every song on this CD..I played it 4 times .
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I found it rather dreary and boring and not nearly as much fun as I had hoped.  Overall, it's hard to see where the charm lies for this piece of software.  It might be better to buy the app, but if a spoonful isn't wonderful, why order the dish?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a beautiful song bird. She is such a great artist whom I adore. She feels down home to me. I like playing this CD.
0399157573|5.0|I have read every Cornwell novel since POST MORTEM and DUST is the best she has written. From the opening scenes of an early morning call from Marino to Scarpetta, recovering from the flu, to learn of the latest death in Cambridge, MA., to the final scenes of nailing the killer, Cornwell is on top of her game. The writing and the brilliant character development of taking Benton, Lucy, Marino and Scarpetta to resolve this latest hideous crime is a pleasure for a reader. I love all the characters that populate Scarpetta's work world: Anne, Bryce, Luke, et. al, and you will recall the memories of her earlier &#34;Rose&#34;, but Bryce is a character which brings present challenge and humor to maintaining Scarpetta's office. The tension as the deaths populate, to the painful journey which Benton feels with his FBI past, to the total brilliance of Lucy's tech skills and what she is able to contribute to resolving the crimes of DUST are remarkable. When I finished the final page, I thought of my own past, like Scarpetta, in Florida, and I relish that time, and most importantly, my own present time in Los Angeles. Thank you, Patricia Cornwell, for DUST, and I look forward to your next Scarpetta tale.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|Nice app. Easy to operate... keep up the good work!<br />It is hard to ask for more than an app that does what it is supposed to do and does it with out a lot of thought.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This is a thrilling and gripping story right from the start, and would make an intense movie. Solstice by Damian Stevenson is an endless stream of psychological twists. I’m amazed by how much depth the author layered into this story. Clearly Stevenson is a natural storyteller and I’m looking forward to more of his work. Dana is an extraordinary character that haunts you long after you put the book down. Anyone that enjoys thrillers or mysteries will love this page-turner. Highly recommended 5-stars.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This is the novel where Jack Reacher becomes a civilian.  It's unfortunate for those who desire military adventure but for the \\"who done it\\" fan it opens a whole new area of detecting.
B005NGKMOU|5.0|This was far better than I thought it would be.  Really, really well done western.  Interesting take on what could have happened to butch cassidy after the famous shootout with the Bolivian army.
B001HN6922|1.0|Extremely disappointed in this movie. My boys LOVE the first Cars movie. Lightning McQueen and Mater are everywhere in our house. I was excited to watch this movie with them, when they got it for their birthday but I was immediately extremely disappointed. We aren't super sheltered with the things our children watch. But when one of the first scenes shows the &#34;bad cars&#34; having killed/crushed a spy agent, I wanted to turn it off. We watched the whole movie and afterwards I thought I was going to have to detox my boys from what they watched. The first movie doesn't have &#34;bad guys&#34; and encourages kids to look outside the box and see the good in everything and want to help others. I didn't see a &#34;theme&#34; to this movie at all, except that it was showing bad behavior and some bad decisions were ok. We won't be watching this one again.<br />The only reason I gave it any stars was because Mater was still his funny self in this movie.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|great graphics on my kindle, addictive levels and cute fishtanks with accessories, best match 3 game out there. fun for kids and adults!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The characters were well developed; I knew them all or so I  thought. The twist and turns were always one step ahead of me I just couldn't read fast enough.  This book will satisfy anyone who loves a fast paced crime story and anyone who tries to understand man's inhumanity. A must read!!!!
B00GOQ9M4O|4.0|This took a very different perspective, focusing entirely on the Governor. Although probably not a favorite episode among viewers, I felt that it was appropriate to show what has become of his character, as we were left with that huge question. A transitional sort of episode for sure, but I'm glad the writers included it so we wouldn't be left hanging. I guess I've been a bit spoiled by the complex and well developed female characters we've met so far, because my only critique would be that the women in his new family are, as another reviewer stated, quite one-dimensional. Well described. Although turning out to be only a cadet in the police academy, it seems Tara would still have gained enough knowledge there to know to shoot a deadly imminent threat in the head, not just fire body shots only. How did they survive without figuring that out? Seems like they would have been eaten up long ago. Maybe just a small thing, but after such incredible acting and cast so far, believable and relateable down to the smallest detail, these gals were a little bit mediocre.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works as advertised for Netflix and Chrome browser. I wish it could show the full screen of my laptop so I could use it for work as well (powerpoint, etc.)
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this, although I can only play it loudly enough to do it justice when the roomie is out. :)  The surround mix sounds fantastic, and in contrast to what some of the other reviews have said I really liked the video portion.  The book is nicely done, too.  All around a great release. I wish more albums would get this treatment.  Highly recommended.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|I read reviews of this watch all over. Most of them said ya have to have this in a collection. It is a work horse.<br />I put it on and don't want to take it off! It looks great and wears great. It's not too heavy and the coloring is nice. I have have it on almost everyday and if it does come off it's only for a day. Great watch.
B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Avril doesn't disappoint. Great beats. Just wish she wouldn't have to swear so much. The music tells the story. It doesn't have to be so blatantly dirty.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|One of the best books I´be read makes a great second book in the series and paves its path to the third one amazingly
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book doesn't say anything that was previously unknown. What it does accomplish is to bring much scholarly work to a much broader audience in an accessible and very engaging form. It offers the interested non-scholar the opportunity to explore what's known about the historical background of Jesus' life and to sample opinions about who Jesus of Nazareth the person, really was.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love love love this game I have it for my phone now for my kindle works perfectly<br />I suggest this game for anyone who loved the fb version
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Love the SB700! I have a SB900 and was looking for a second flash to use for OCF! This one works perfect! In fact I plan to purchase another 700 within the next few days!!
1416511946|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Loved it!! Very insightful and emotional. I learned quite a bit about the depths of the music world and the world of drug abuse.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I didn't think this book did justice to the first 2.  The first two were so incredibly great and hard to put down.  This one seemed like a lull.  The ending was dissappointing, The characters and conflicts were bland.  Maybe it was the hype and anticipation of a year waiting for the third installment, in any case I didn't like it.  Now after reading the third book, I really don't want to go see the movie which I had been anticipating as well.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Armin Van Buuren is GOD. He continues to produce ear-gasmic dance tunes that are as pleasing to the ears as they are to the feet! If your a fan of the Trance scene then this is a must buy! If not, this album will make you a fan of the genre. Either way a must buy!
B008MM9630|5.0|This is a really cute, and for me a very relaxing game. I like that I don't have to depend on neighbors to help me again in the game! I'm just getting started but am already hooked!
B0078Q2HAA|4.0|Meryl Streep turns in an unforgettable performance as Margaret Thatcher in &#34;Iron Lady&#34;. As in so many other roles, Streep totally inhabits this character - from the accent to the hair, to the posture and speech patterns. She must have studied Thatcher tapes incessantly to absorb the mannerisms of this formidable and important historical character. And to do it while Ms. Thatcher was still alive must have added a tension and pressure to get it absolutely perfect.<br /><br />In spite of this excellent casting decision, as well as Jim Broadbent as her husband, Denis, the screen play focuses more on the decay and old age of a once powerful woman rather than her impressive accomplishments. The story is told via flashbacks from the perspective of the elderly, widowed Thatcher who has developed dementia, and hallucinates that Denis is still with her. This narrative structure diminishes the historic significance of the career of a renowned political leader who steered Britain through some very challenging times. Though &#34;Iron Lady&#34; could have delivered so much more, I still enjoyed the history and flashback into the 1980's and the tough times that the Thatcher's endured.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent telling of the continuing story of tale. Good background for individual characters and tv series. Highly recommend it to fans
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Seriously addictive. Do not start playing this game if you ever want to have conversations without subconsciously wondering how long until your lives will be full again!
B000SINT52|5.0|Michael Moore's film was highly informative, the NTSC version that I purchased gave better results for some of the news coverage shots which degrade when re-converted to PAL.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Can't seem to stop playing. Very frustrating that I can't get past that particularly nasty level 23. What's the secret?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Certainly one of Grisham's best books, I found it a joy to read. It's not only a great story, masterfully written, it's legally accurate. My wife is an Elder Law attorney and normally she gets impatient with legal thrillers because they have little to do with the real lives of lawyers.  Not this one.  When I read her the narratives about the legal aspects of dealing with estates and broken families and the deadliness of legal research, she agreed all the way.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Happy to re-visit the characters from &#34;A Time to Kill.&#34; I'm a big fan of John Grisham and have read all his books. He sometimes disappoints, but not this time. An excellent read!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love Ebay.  Always love the app to use on my Kindle. Ebay is available at the touch of your fingers.
B00EK3EFEA|4.0|Since her release of Bible Belt in 2009, which was a phenomenal debut cd,  I have become a Diane Birch fan. Despite the great reviews that cd received it was very disappointing Diane did not get the fame and recognition that she deserved. However, with the release of Speak a Little Louder, her second cd, all that may change.<br />Although this cd is very different from Bible Belt, it shows her progression as an artist and growth as a person. While the previous cd had Diane being compared to Carol King, she can easily be compared to Kate Bush and Stevie Nicks on this cd. Diane shows she is willing to expand her style and not remain in familiar territory. The lyrics and emotion are written from a very sincere place. Each song is honest and heartfelt and no two songs sound alike making each song very unique, and  making this an outstanding cd. This is one of the best cds for 2013!<br />Although each song has something to offer, there are a lot of stand out moments, these include, Speak a little louder, Lighthouse, Tell me tomorrow, Pretty in pain, Frozen over, Diamonds in the dust, Unfkd, Walk the rainbow to the end, It plays on, and Truer than blue.<br />If this cd does not go all the way, it will prove there is no justice in the music business, since Diane is a talented songwriter, singer, and musician who deserves it all.
B0030B1WBM|5.0|Fun to watch again and again at just the right price.  HD who could ask for anything more? Great fun for the whole family
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|I am sorry to say (write) that this new cd by Lady Gaga is not worth the money. While I am not a big fan of LG, I will admit that she is a great songwriter and performer as she has shown on her first  two cds \\" The  Fame \\" and \\"The Fame Monster\\". Truth be told I was not too impressed with \\"Born This Way\\" which was to be expected after having such great success with the former two cds.<br />PopArt as it is called, has neither of these two elements!<br />The only good song, and that is because the rest is so bad, is Gypsy.<br />The rest of the cd is just boring.<br />I think LG has gotten lost in her own hype and tried too hard to create something for her \\"lil monster\\" but has produced a complete failure. The entire cd has one beat and all the songs are monotonous, the lyrics are arty and pretentious.<br />I am not trying to \\"hate\\" on LG. I just think there is more depth to her talent and that she could have produced a much better cd.<br />Or maybe it is just my expectations.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like the game, but there are quests that require you to use Facebook.  I don't have a Facebook account (gasp - I know) and wish there was an alternative quest to still get the rewards.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I like her humor. Laughed a lot in the beginning. Creative in her ideas...enjoyed that. There was some overstating of the obvious but not too much.
